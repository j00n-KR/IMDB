0,bkoganbing,Fast Cars And Those Who Drive Them,5,9 April 2009,"I had just come from a rather desultory day at the movies where I saw the sequel Fast & Furious to this film. I had written in the review that you probably would have had to see the first film in order to fully appreciate what was going on. Wouldn't you know it, the FX channel was broadcasting this tonight. I was partially correct, but this film had a bit more plot to it and didn't concentrate on just the special effects and the violence which was served up fast and furious. Vin Diesel is a criminal who races cars as an avocation and does hijackings for a living. The FBI wants him, the LAPD wants him and Paul Walker is an LAPD cop gone undercover to get him.Walker takes his assignment quite literally and part of getting undercover is under some blankets with Diesel's sister Jordana Brewster and getting it on with the young lady. But he also proves his driving abilities to Diesel.Diesel's racing rivals are some Asian gangbangers headed by Rick Yune and Walker would dearly like to pin something on them. Still it's Diesel his superiors want and it's Diesel they will have come what may.Paul Walker compromised his effectiveness as an undercover agent thoroughly in this film. In fact at the beginning of the sequel it is remarked that he's lucky to still be holding a job. Makes for some rather unbelievable viewing.But fans of fast cars and those who drive them will definitely like The Fast And The Furious.",The Fast and the Furious
1,Leofwine_draca,Good race scenes lift a fast-paced thriller,5,11 July 2016,"Here's a throwaway popcorn flick that manages to be engaging thanks to the central storyline, that old chestnut of the detective going undercover and becoming friends with the man he's supposed to be sending to jail. The old, old plot is given a new spin with a fresh cast and an interesting backdrop – illegal street racing. Given the MTV expectations, the film is as flashy as you would expect thanks to director Rob Cohen, packed with pumped up loud music to drive to and enough testosterone to fill three football fields. Still, have no misconceptions: this is a high-octane thrill-ride and professes to be nothing more and nothing less.The film certainly satisfies on the action front, with some madly exciting car chases and stunts, although there is a definite lull in the action around midway which is a bit surprising. Thankfully things finish off with an expertly done, extended set-piece involving a truck and an amazing car crash to finish things off (ludicrously spoilt in the trailer). Even cooler, the DVD allows you to rewatch the stunt from EIGHT different camera angles, a feature which has made the format for me.The characterisation is a bit thin on the ground but the two leads are strong: Paul Walker does nothing wrong as the young undercover cop, and Vin Diesel manages to be effortlessly cool and a natural born leader again after PITCH BLACK. The supporting cast is ho-hum, but it is interesting to see DIE ANOTHER DAY's Rick Yune without all that makeup on. Not a perfect movie, but fast-paced and interesting enough to be worth a look.",The Fast and the Furious
2,SnoopyStyle,Cars look cool and Babes look hot,7,2 November 2013,"Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) leads a group of friends and family to street race in the LA night. Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker) is a cop working undercover to infiltrate his gang of suspected truck robberies. However he finds himself falling under Dominic's charisma and for Dominic's sister Mia (Jordana Brewster).There is a lot of silly action, and unrealistic story lines. This is purely style winning over substance. The cars look cool and babes look hot. But it's the Vin Diesel presence and Paul Walker pretty boy looks that provide the heart of this movie. The boys have amazing chemistry and the gang feels like a real family. The story is almost unnecessary.",The Fast and the Furious
3,Horst_In_Translation,How it all began,4,4 June 2017,"""The Fast and the Furious"" is an American movie from 2001, so this one had its 15th anniversary already last year. It runs for 105 minutes roughly and the script was developed overall by no less than 4 writers, the most known one being David Ayer I guess. The director is Rob Cohen and this is probably still the most known effort from his career. He never returned to direct any other of this franchise's films. And now I said it already that this action movie we have here is the very first from the extremely long-running F&F franchise that is still very strong today. Eight films have been there so far and two more are already greenlit. The franchise seems unstoppable as even the death of number 1 lead actor (at least in this film we have here) Paul Walker did not put an end to the series. But we don't wanna talk about his tragic fate today, but instead focus on this film we have here. Tragic, or at least sad, is also a fitting description for the film I would say as I was not convinced by anything in here really apart from the effects perhaps. People often say that this is a movie for men, but if you take a look at the demographics here you will realize that women have actually given it an 0.3 higher rating, which of course also has to do with the quantity of voters. But still, saying this is a film for men is is pretty inaccurate in my opinion as it would imply that men have worse taste in film than women because honestly there is nothing impressive at all about the story here, the character writing and also the performances.I believe that in terms of depth, the story could have fit in under one hour as well. The rest is mostly ""cool"" quotes that add nothing really, gimmicky behavior from the characters and then of course the pompous action scenes that turn this film into a definite case of style over substance. The core story of a cop infiltrating a gang of very fast drivers in order to get evidence on illegal activities is nothing that hasn't been done before and frequently better. If you read the actors' names, you also know that honestly you can't expect any powerhouse performances in here. It is all subordinated to the visual side and with the casting they absolutely made sure none of the cast members is going to take any attention away from that. The epilogue is probably even more embarrassing than the rest and honestly, having seen none of the many many sequels, I truly hope they managed to step things up and give audiences more than pointlessly spectacular car sequences and when they had enough of that, they switched to motorbikes and even helicopters. With films like this, there is of course always the opportunity for pointless fun, but this requires the film to not take itself as seriously as this one here did on several occasions. I give it a thumbs-down and like I said: If the following films don't show improvement, then I probably cannot be as generous as I was here with my 4/10 rating. Watch something else instead.",The Fast and the Furious
4,kosmasp,Diesel Show,6,11 August 2009,"While Paul Walker is the Protagonist (main role) in this movie, Vin Diesel steals the show. Apart from the car stunts that is. Because if you don't have good stunts, than the movie doesn't work at all. The story as it is, is pretty cliché, but it's nice fun and it's also watchable.Especially because as mentioned, because of a mesmerizing (for this genre) performance from Vin Diesel. A few flops later and nobody remembered why he was called the new Action Hero, but watching this (and of course the superb ""Pitch Black"") might remind you why you liked him in the first place (or could be a reason to discover him for a younger audience). Cars, women, insane stunts, solid/decent acting (for this genre) and nice characters ... what more could you ask for, from a movie like this? Not much more I think :o)",The Fast and the Furious
5,classicsoncall,"""I live my life a quarter mile at a time.""",7,26 July 2021,"I'm really late to the party on this one since it's now twenty years old. My reservation has always been watching a mindless action flick with over the top stunts and CGI enhanced special effects. Well, I wasn't let down in my assumption, but if you can pardon the pun, it was a pretty wild ride. Vin Diesel is one of those bad guys you can't help rooting for, he's like Ric Flair or Randy Savage in the wrestling world. His character is Dom Toretto, leader of a street racing gang, excuse me, 'team', and the story line is built around him and undercover cop Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker), who infiltrates the racing community in order to stop a string of trailer hijackings. The racing action is to be expected, and even somewhat believable until you get to that manic hijacking where the truck driver is pretty adept at protecting his rig, while O'Conner jumps in to pull Toretto's fat out of the fire, along with his top gunslinger Vince (Matt Schulze). It wouldn't be a hot car flick without some hot babes and you have that as well with a couple romantic angles thrown in, but the main attraction is the street cars and the unparalleled stunts they're asked to perform. There's a reason it's called 'Fast and Furious'.",The Fast and the Furious
6,gavin6942,Somehow Created a Series,6,23 August 2016,"Los Angeles police officer Brian O'Connor (Paul Walker) must decide where his loyalty really lies when he becomes enamored with the street racing world he has been sent undercover to destroy.As of now (2016), I cannot even keep track of how many films there are in this series. At least eight, maybe nine, and that's not counting the original version which has almost nothing to do with this one. How this movie spawned a whole industry is beyond me.Not that it is a bad movie, but it really has no depth at all. A guy races cars, and everyone else races cars, and the guy is attracted to another guy's sister. It all falls into place so easily, no hassle, no time to find out who anyone is. And yet, this is the movie that made Paul Walker immortal.",The Fast and the Furious
7,lee_eisenberg,Improbably cool.,7,9 March 2006,"On one level, ""The Fast and the Furious"" is two hours of machismo. But on another level, it does show the subculture of street racing. Before it came out, I'd never known that people soup their cars up with nitrous oxide to increase speed. Vin Diesel plays his typical role, and Paul Walker almost seems like a side character.I should identify that much of the movie looks pretty improbable. I won't divulge the scenes right here for risk of spoiling the movie, but trust me: you'll know these scenes when you see them. But like I said, the movie does give one an insight into the world of street racing. I never saw the sequel; I heard that it was the average kind of sequel (and summer 2003 saw a slew of lousy sequels).",The Fast and the Furious
8,jboothmillard,The Fast and the Furious,6,14 May 2008,"This was the first film in what would become a non-stop high octane franchise full of cool and fast cars racing and chasing each other, including lots of action and some stunts along the way, directed by Rob Cohen (Dragonheart). Basically a string of high-speed truck robberies, stealing millions of dollars worth of electronic equipment, have been occurring, Los Angeles street racing gang leader Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) is under suspicion for these hijacking crimes. Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker) is an officer for the LAPD and goes undercover, joining Toretto's highly skilled crew of racers, taking part in many illegal late night street races for high stakes. As time goes by however Brian is compromising his assignment by becoming part of Toretto's life, he is sympathising with the chief suspect, and falling in love with Toretto's sister Mia (The Faculty's Jordana Brewster), he eventually starts to try and prove Toretto's innocence. Also starring Michelle Rodriguez as Toretto's girlfriend Letty, Die Another Day's Rick Yune as Johnny Tran, Chad Lindberg as Jesse, Johnny Strong as Leon, Ted Levine as Sergeant Tanner, Matt Schulze as Vince, rapper Ja Rule as Edwin, Space Jam's Thom Barry as Agent Bilkins and Bruce Almighty's Noel Gugliemi as Hector. Diesel with his gravely voice is cool, Walker is blank most of the time but a reasonable hero, and supporting cast members Brewster and Rodriguez do fine as well. To be honest, the storyline going on is not the thing to pay the fullest attention to, as the title suggests it the pedal-to-the-metal stuff, all the colourful and cool cars fuelled up, with extra rocket boosters and switches, that speed and crash their way around, and the explosions and stunts along the way keep the pace up as well, all in all it is a worthwhile action thriller. Good!",The Fast and the Furious
9,Tweekums,Fun if fairly mindless action flick,7,12 November 2015,"Brian O'Connor is a Los Angeles police officer who is working undercover to discover the identity of a group involved in a series of truck hijackings. To this end he tries to get in with the street racing community. To do this he will not only need to take part in the races he will have to impress the other racers. His bosses are convinced that one Dominic Toretto is behind the crimes but as Brian gets to know him he becomes less sure and is soon convinced that a group of Chinese racers are the ones involved is this really the case or of Brian becoming a bit too friendly with Toretto? He has also fallen for Toretto's beautiful sister which leads to some friction with another one of the group who also has the hots for her.If you are looking for the 'Citizen Kane' of action movies this isn't it; however if you just want some good mindless fun with fast cars and a good looking cast you could do much worse. Early on I thought this would just be 'Point Break' with street racers instead of surfers in many ways it is but there are as many differences as similarities. As one might expect there are a succession of action set pieces; this include several races, fights, shootings and a spectacular truck robbery that goes horribly wrong. These are pretty exciting even if they are a bit unrealistic at times an example of this is the truck hijacking; it takes place on what appears to be a main road but we don't see a single other vehicle for the entire scene if you can ignore this sort of thing this shouldn't detract from the film. The cast might not be Oscar contenders but the do a solid job. Overall this is a solid enough brain-in-neutral action film.",The Fast and the Furious
10,BA_Harrison,The start of Universal's biggest franchise to date.,7,25 July 2015,"A slick, adrenaline-fuelled action flick featuring a hot cast, a cool soundtrack, and countless custom cars, The Fast and the Furious is designed primarily to appeal to the young petrol-head crowd—those who would spend a fortune on a sound system for their ride and then blast crap music out of the windows while sat in a McDonald's car park (at least here in the UK). Anyone heavily into car culture will probably wet themselves in excitement over the modified machines on display.But even if the idea of highly-polished Japanese street cars with more expensive accessories than a Kardashian doesn't get your pistons pumping, there's always the human eye-candy: for the ladies, there's blonde-haired, blue-eyed Paul Walker and bald bit of rough Vin Diesel, while the guys get numerous tasty young women to ogle, including Jordana Brewster as Vin Diesel's younger sister and Michelle Rodriguez as feisty girl-racer Letty. We also get lots of impressive stunts to keep the pulse pounding, with a great chase scene featuring one character dangling from a truck cab while being shot at by the driver, and a white-knuckle jump across railway tracks in front of an oncoming train that results in a spectacular crash.",The Fast and the Furious
11,Quinoa1984,Great action and illogic make this a good B movie,7,22 June 2001,"The Fast and the Furious star the always good Vin Diesel as a car racer- on the streets.  He meets Brian (Paul Walker) in a good stoke of luck as he saves him from the cops.  Then some more plot comes in into the film, but it the action that counts here.Giving credit where credit is due, the film has outstanding action sequences involving car chases that haven't been this exhilarating since the infamous pod race in Phantom Menace.  Plus (and surprisingly), the film envelops you into the story, and it makes you feel some actual feeling for the characters among the blaze of the cars.  And for that I reccomend this movie for the thrill seeking audience that has chomped up the recent popcorn flicks such as Mummy 2, Tomb Raider and Swordfish (Fast and Furious is one of the best ones of it's kind so far this year).However, with most B flicks come the inevitable flaws, and this has 2 usual yet still dumb ones.  1, from the looks at some of the steamy and violent scenes in the movie, it looks like as if director Cohen was making a rated R movie filled with even more action, sexual content and dare I say naughty language in the mix.  Yet, once again, it might seem, the guys up top have made this film into yet another PG-13 flick to try and up the sales.  That's why say what you will about the South Park movie, but at least they kept on trying at it until they got the R (and that is also evident from the s**t episode from 2 days ago) unlike such movies as Bring It On and Coyote Ugly.And 2 (illogical part), this film takes place in Los Angeles, a city that is sometimes called the city on wheels.  Then how come when the race in the streets scenes come up, you almost see no cars whatsoever on the streets (unless it's used for the plot or something)?  I have a feeling that even though this doesn't have much logic in it, at least it's better here than in New York, cause then it would be just plain ludicrous.  Anyway, like I said, It's a good action movie, though not a great one.  Kudos go to the director, stunt co-ordinators, drivers and Diesel.  B+",The Fast and the Furious
12,edwagreen,Fast & Furious-Slow Down the Anger *1/2,3,5 September 2010,"Wretched film dealing with an undercover police officer who infiltrates a gang involved in drug trafficking.Vin Diesel looks like a younger version of the late Telly Savalas in many of the scenes of this terrible film.Yes, you have wonderful chase scenes which brings back memories of ""The French Connection."" Must all chase scenes be related to either the wild west or the drug scene.The story is poorly written. Why was the sister of Diesel bumped off? Who is the other girl?Yet, the worst thing about this movie is what it makes of the criminal justice system. Even when punished after helping an officer, the film ends on the note of defiance directed against that very system. This is terribly wrong and sends a wrong message to our youth.",The Fast and the Furious

14,BandSAboutMovies,First of many,4,3 August 2020,"Twenty years ago - has it been that long? - Paul Walker and director Rob Cohen made The Skulls together. Cohen got a deal with producer Neal H. Moritz and Universal Pictures. Looking for ideas, he asked Walker what his dream action movie would be. The answer? A mix of Days of Thunder and Donnie Brasco. After a May 1998 issue of Vibe detailed New York City's street racing scene, they had their film. All they needed was a co-star.After Gone In 60 Seconds, Universal wanted Timothy Olyphant but they got Moritz's pick instead: Vin Diesel, hot off the success of Pitch Black. And then, seventy-eight wrecked cars later, we had a movie. Any similarity to the D.B. Sweeney and Charlie Sheen film No Man's Land - which came out thirteen years before - is surely coincidental.LAPD officer Brian O'Conner (Walker) has gone undercover to infiltrate the gang that has been stealing from trucks and disappearing. He soon makes it into the gang led by Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel), who has been banned from pro racing after attacking the man who accidentally killed his father, but complicating matters is that he soon falls for Dominic's sister Letty (Jordanna Brewster).This movie was originally entitled Racer X (the name of the Vibe article), Race Wars and Redline, but then someone had the brilliant idea to ask Roger Corman if they could use the title of his 1955 film The Fast and the Furious. Getting paid again for a movie he already made? I can only imagine how delighted Corman had to be at the prospect.This movie made stars of both Walker and Diesel. Waker would work with Ted Levine again - he plays one of his bosses here - in Joyride, while Diesel would refuse to be in the next few sequels to this movie.This was a movie decimated by the critics. Actually it wasn't until the last few movies that anyone would even admit they liked these. How times have changed.",The Fast and the Furious

Otherwise don't expect much to redeem pit grease. An undercover cop(Paul Walker) infiltrates a gang of L.A. street racers in hopes of solving moonlight highway robberies. Also in the cast are Chad Lindberg, Rick Yune, Ja Rule and the ever so hot Michelle Rodriguez. Not the worst ever made, but an Indy 500 away from mediocre.

17,hitchcockthelegend,Action junkies and thrill seekers apply here.,8,28 April 2009,"As night falls on the streets of L.A., souped up cars, driven by souped up kids, illegally race at incredible speeds. That alone is more than enough to keep the cops busy, but it appears that a number of robberies on moving trucks could well be the work of the speed racers. Time for someone to go undercover, someone with a flair for speed and daring do heroics.........The title says it all actually, from the very first sequence to the pulsating ripper of a finale, this film really is fast and furious. Dumb in substance and morally dubious in to the bargain, it is however one of the finest exponents of the action/thriller/crime genre of modern times. Owing certain debts to Point Break and Stone Cold, director Rob Cohen has crafted a technically adroit picture which is an assault on the eyes and the ears. Cars tear around, crash bang and wallop, thru the camera, under trucks, in front of speeding trains and on it goes, with no real let up till the end credits roll. There is a plot, it's thin, but it does have a story from which to race around. The cast flex their muscles and pout respectively, with a little bit of eye candy for either sexes to admire from their comfy chairs. Boasting great stunt work mixed in with very capable CGI, The Fast And The Furious deserves much better regard than it currently has on some internet sites. Why? Because it does what it tells you it will do from the title, and as dumb as it is, it's the best kind of dumb to loose yourself with. 8/10",The Fast and the Furious

It would be flippant to criticise something that was produced solely for MTV addicts so I won`t mention that Rob Cohen`s direction is just a feature length music video where the chicks are too fit to be true or that when someone walks around they do so in sexy slo mo , or that the soundtrack is intrusive , or that the cars are too fast to be realistic or that the multi ethnic problems of street culture are ignored . In fact that is a valid criticism as the bloods , crips , underclass and middle class students all get together and no one seems to have a culture issue . Vin Diesel is another valid criticism . Am I alone in thinking that he`s the only leading man in film history who rivals Steven Segal as most unconvincing actor ever ? Oh and I have never ever seen so much product placement in my life . Aren`t there any laws against this sort of thing ? By a very strange irony I have a FAST AND FURIOUS T-shirt .

This is a throwback of those dumb 1970s drive-in movies...it's for people who like loud, fast films filled with mindless action, attractive women, cars...and nothing else.  I didn't like the film.  It was too loud, too silly and way too long for a dumb action flick.  What saves it is some truly incredible action sequences (the ""hijacking"" sequence towards the end was unbelievable), some very nice, innovative direction, a cast that manages to be good despite the script and a very good performance by Vin Diesel. This was supposed to be Walker's breakthrough film but Diesel steals it away.  Also it looks kind of silly to have tall, lean, pretty boy Walker against tall, muscular, severe-looking Diesel.See it for the action and Diesel.

20,poolandrews,"""If you want time buy the magazine."" Entertaining enough but rather shallow.",6,25 December 2007,"The Fast and the Furious is set in Los Angeles & starts as undercover cop Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker) enters an illegal street race between racers with high performance sports cars, he bets his $80,000 car that he'll win but instead loses. Suddenly the cops show up & he manages to save Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) from being arrested, Brian gains Dominic's trust in an attempt to use his knowledge & contacts to identify & take down a gang of street racers who are hijacking huge container trucks & stealing millions of dollars of electrical goods...This American German co-production was directed by Rob Cohen who has a small cameo as the pizza delivery guy & is an entertaining action flick without ever reaching the heights of greatness. The script by Gary Scott Thompson, Erik Bergquist & David Ayer moves along at a reasonable pace & has decent amounts of action but it never quite satisfied me totally in any area. The plot is predictable & pretty standard fare, the twists have little dramatic impact like the revelation that Brian is a cop or that Dominic is behind the hijackings. A lot more could have been done with them. I usually don't take the moral high ground but in the case of The Fast and the Furious I feel I have to considering the age group this will appeal too, I mean it turns the criminal element into hero's which didn't sit well with me especially at the end when the cop is more concerned about the scumbag hijackers than the poor innocent truck driver! This isn't as action packed as you might like either, sure there's a good opening street race through LA & some good stunts during the final hijack but otherwise it's all show & no substance, just like the cars featured in fact. There are plenty of scenes with high powered cars reeving their engines, plenty of scenes of nicely painted sports cars driving around & plenty of scenes of them breaking the speed limit but it doesn't really amount to much apart from the opening race & the final twenty minutes. The character's are OK if a bit clichéd (I mean Brian actually starts to respect Dominic after being around him for a while...), it keeps one interest & it certainly passes the time harmlessly enough without ever being outstanding.Director Cohen does OK & turns in a suitably glossy looking film that will probably appeal to the boy racers out there as it glamorises the notion of street racing, winning at any costs & show's these souped up sports cars in as good a light as just about any film out there. The cars themselves look nice enough for sure & they are a pleasant distraction whenever on screen I suppose, at least they divert attention away from the acting. The film has some style about it for sure, the opening street race for instance when they reach top speeds the lights outside the windows blur into one long bright line & there are other tricks used as well to make a cool sequence. The violence is minimal so there's no need to worry about that.With a supposed budget of about $38,000,000 I wouldn't call The Fast and the Furious exactly low budget but it's not up there with the 100 million plus Hollywood blockbusters, making $40,000,000 on it's opening weekend in theatres it did really well & I think it was a bit of a surprise to everyone involved with it. It's well made with some decent CGI computer effects as well as some good old fashion stunt work. I must admit I didn't like the loud electronic dance type music though. The acting is not great, Vin Diesel was paid a cool $2,000,000 apparently & he's pretty poor, just check out his speech to Brian about his father! Jordana Brewster & Michelle Rodriguez provide the good looks & do a fine job.The Fast and the Furious is a good solid action thriller, it's not that great in storytelling terms but I think it provides enough cool action, macho moments & fast cars to keep most quiet for 100 odd minutes. Followed by two sequels, 2 Fast 2 Furious (2003) & The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift (2006) while a third sequel is currently in production.",The Fast and the Furious
21,zardoz-13,"Fast, Furious But Formulaic!",8,24 April 2009,"Not surprisingly, plot takes a back seat to action in ""Dragonheart"" director Rob Cohen's ""The Fast and the Furious,"" with Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, Michelle Rodriguez, Jordana Brewster, Paul Walker, and Matt Schulze. This cinematically souped-up, hot rod retread of ""Point Break"" (1987) with illegal street racing instead of skydiving and surfing qualifies as an entertaining but amoral thriller with enough action to satisfy the most attention-deficit viewer.A white LAPD rookie cop who wants a detective's shield goes undercover in to crack down on a ring of daredevil truck hijackers. Gritty performances from a credible ensemble cast topped off with gripping, high-velocity races that smoke ""Gone in 60 Seconds"" and ""Driven"" offset this fast-paced but formulaic anthology of clichés that masquerades as a plot. Once upon a time, Hollywood designed movies as morality plays, rewarding good and punishing evil. Those conventional rules no longer apply in our enlightened liberal 21st century. Nowadays, villains stand a better-than-average chance of escaping the consequences of their skullduggery.At least, ""The Fast and the Furious"" differs from the usual summer tripe, because it ushers audiences into another world where rival Los Angeles youth gangs race nitrous oxide-powered illegal street roadsters with computer-controlled fuel injection systems. Scenarists Gary Scott Thompson of ""Hollow Man,"" freshman writer Erick Bergquist, John Pogue of ""U.S. Marshals,"" and David Ayer of ""U-571"" based their preposterous but unpredictable screenplay on Ken Li's ""Vibe"" magazine article.The twentysomething protagonists in ""The Fast and the Furious"" go to elaborate lengths to close down quarter-mile stretches of roads to drag race in the nocturnal urban landscape. They post sentinels to monitor the local authorities on scanners so that they can evade detection from the police and drive like hellions. Indeed, this kind of thing really happens. Dominic 'Dom' Toretto (brawny Vin Diesel of ""Saving Private Ryan"") reigns as the underworld king of dragsters. ""I live my life a quarter-mile at a time,"" this hard-bitten, existential felon confides in Brian O'Connor (Paul Walker of ""The Skulls""), ""and for those ten seconds, I'm free."" Brian races against Dom, but he loses. Later, he rescues Dom conveniently when the LAPD arrests fleeing hot rodders from a drag race. Luckily, our hero finds himself on the inside track with the suspects. Dom's childhood buddy Vince (Matt Schulze of ""Blade"") accuses Brian of being a cop. When Dom asks Brian, our hero deftly sidesteps the question. No sooner has Brian ingratiated himself with Dom than he finds himself infatuated with the prime suspect's sexy kid sister Mia (Jordana Brewster of ""The Faculty"") and plumbs her for information. Eventually, Mia breaks down and fesses up to Brian, but not before the villains stage one final hijacking. Brian and Mia race off to stop them before it is too late.Americans worship rebels, and these charismatic hot rodders attain larger-than-life, heroic stature in ""The Fast and the Furious."" Not only does this actioneer deliberately flaunt the law with an out-of-the-blue surprise ending, but the filmmakers also invite negative charges for glorifying the reckless shenanigans of their ultra-cool, anti-establishment dragsters. The chief offending scene depicts a dangerous game of chicken between the hero and villain to see who can beat a train across an intersection and survive.Altogether, the testosterone-fueled, adrenaline-laced races make ""The Fast and the Furious"" worth strapping yourself in for if your summer appears to be heading for the doldrums. The sequels ""2 Fast 2 Furious"" and ""The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift"" were average, but the protagonists from the original would not regroup until 2009's third sequel ""Fast and Furious"" with Vin Diesel and Paul Walker working hand in hand to bust a notorious drug dealer. The special effects shots when the car engines receive their jolts of nitrous oxide are imaginative. Brian O'Connor's boss is played by none other than ""Silence of the Lambs"" serial killer Ted Levine. Director Rob Cohen has a cameo as a pizza delivery driver and producer Neal H. Moritz cruises through one scene in a Ferrari.",The Fast and the Furious
22,Boba_Fett1138,Hot chicks & cool cars...,4,22 June 2003,"...yep, it's a guy movie all right.""The Fast and the Furious"" is the movie that made street racing popular (at least here in The Netherlands it did) But is it good movie? I think not, i found it pretty disappointing, maybe it was because I set my expectations for it too high.The movie is nothing more then a remake of ""Point Break"" with cars, set in the 00's and is aimed at the teenage viewers. The story is pretty simple and to be honest I didn't liked it, I wanted to see more racing instead of focusing on the undercover mission of Brian. So basically I'm saying that the movie would have been better if it didn't had a story at all!The characters and the atmosphere can be described as ""cool"". I actually like the acting in this one and I'm one of the few people who thinks that Vin Diesel is actually a pretty talented actor that just wastes his talent by playing only cool macho guys. Watch ""Saving Private Ryan"" to understand what I'm talking about. And Ja Rule actually acts better then he sings, but I don't know if that's a compliment.The car scene's are all right but it didn't gave me the adrenaline rush I wanted and the were to little race scene's for my taste. The movie does have it's moments, but overall it's disappointing.All in all only watchable if you like cool cars and fast racing.

The acting isn't too bad, vin diesel and Paul walker hold their own, and the supporting ladies bring their A game. The action / car racing is pretty good, it's the early ages of CGI so the shots aren't the best, but most of the real racing holds its own.

It may have very well been enough to see gorgeous tricked out Japanese cars racing each other, but it was enhanced by some very good camera work and special effects. If you closed your eyes and just listened to the movie, you would probably be driven to lay yourself in the path of one of these cars because the dialogue and acting was so God awful. But if you were to do the opposite, meaning close your ears and just watch, you would have been privy to a marvelous treat.

25,Uriah43,Fast-Paced Action and Drama,6,2 January 2017,"Set in Los Angeles, this movie focuses on a team of thieves who hijack trucks operating a high speeds from optimally powered race cars. The cargo is then taken and sold on the black market. Needless to say, the FBI and local authorities are anxious to capture and prosecute these criminals before the truckers take matters into their own hands. To help them on this case a young police officer by the name of ""Brian O'Conner"" (Paul Walker) volunteers to go undercover and infiltrate the most high-profile illegal street racing team in the area which is led by a man named ""Dominic Toretto"" (Vin Diesel) who also has a prison record for violence due to his explosive temper. However, in order to investigate this case Brian first has to get inside this close-knit team and that is more difficult than anybody realizes. Additionally, this particular team is but one of many and it might not be the one responsible. But one thing is sure-action needs to be taken soon before violence erupts on the highways. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this film has enough fast-paced action and drama to satisfy most fans of the genre. No doubt about it. On a more critical note though, I thought that some of the characters-most notably ""Letty"" (Michelle Rodriguez), ""Vince"" (Matt Schulze) and ""Hector"" (Noel Gugliemi)--were much too pretentious and almost to the point of being downright annoying. Likewise, some of the previously mentioned action scenes were more than a little unrealistic as well. But that's Hollywood for you. In any case, from what I understand this film has turned into a profitable enterprise for Universal Pictures and since nothing succeeds like success has bred numerous sequels in its wake. That said, despite the flaws just mentioned I enjoyed this movie and I have rated it accordingly. Slightly above average.",The Fast and the Furious

Paul Walker plays an undercover cop out to expose illegal drag races. They hijack trucks by surrounding their target and harpooning their way inside. Police fear that the truckers will arm themselves. Walker is unwelcome at a hangout since the waitress shows him more respect. She is sister to star racer Vin Diesel who seems unfazed at the violent commotion. Walker wins Diesel's trust in a crucial moment. Disturbing film where law can be broken pending on who you know on the police force. Director Rob Cohen keeps the action at fast pace. This is a much different film from his previous, which includes Dragonheart and Daylight. Diesel is the so-called hero who will win over the mostly young male audience and get rewarded for his reckless lifestyle. Walker is total cardboard who will eventually be found out yet be the good guy to the bad guys. Jordana Brewster as Diesel's sister is there to sleep with Walker. Michelle Rodriguez also makes a wasted appearance. Smokey and the Bandit is much more entertaining and contains just as much nonsense. The difference is that the characters are more interesting.

Michelle Rodriguez is on hand as Dom's babe while Matt Schulze plays an angry member of his gang.""The Fast and the Furious"" (2001) was the beginning of the popular street-racing franchise that currently has eight movies with two more planned. The over-the-top action is akin to ""The Road Warrior"" (1981) while the tone mixes the comic book melodrama of ""The Warriors"" (1979) and ""Torque"" (2004) with the more serious air of ""Grand Canyon"" (1991) and ""Training Day"" (2001). (Yes, I realize ""Torque"" and ""Training Day"" debuted after this one; I'm just providing comparative references).Speaking of the tone, there's no goofiness and the actors take everything dead seriously, which is good in my book, but the flick has several unintentional laughs because, while quasi-realistic, the thrills & posing are so exaggerated.Brewster and Rodriguez are effective in the feminine department, but neither do much for me personally. There are a few good-looking ladies in the periphery, however.The soundtrack contains several dynamic urban numbers, including the excellent ""Deep Enough"" by Live.The movie runs 1 hour, 46 minutes and was shot in Los Angeles & nearby areas (San Bernardino, Hemet, Malibu, Westminster, Beverly Hills, etc.).GRADE: B",The Fast and the Furious

It's definitely a turn-your-brain-off-for-two-hours flick, a nice popcorn flick. The plot is your basic undercover cop conflicted by his attachment to those he is infiltrating kind of thing. No real surprises here. The acting is quite good. I'm putting my money on Vin Diesel becoming the next Arnold Schwarzenegger. Michelle Rodriguez, who was just amazing in last year's Girlfight (she is why I saw this film), is extremely sexy in it. Oh yeah, she gives a good performance, too. I hope she gets some great roles after the success of this movie. The other performers are all relatively good. There aren't any weak spots. The action, which is why most will see The Fast and the Furious, is very good. Although one might wonder why it takes five minutes, even in slow motion, for cars that go 150+ MPH, to travel a quarter of a mile, it doesn't hurt the flick too much. I generally don't like car chase movies. The Mad Max films and this are probably the only exceptions. I was clenching my teeth during several action sequences. 7/10.",The Fast and the Furious

I'm not normally into all that macho stuff but because it's involving cars I must had a closer look to the success of the series.Once over I thought to myself, why is this a hype. It surely isn't going to win any prices and Vin Diesel (Dominic Toretto)isn't the kind of actor that gives great performances (well maybe in the Riddick franchise). But then again I was surprised to see some well known faces from the genre I like, horror sci-fi and exploitation, and see Michelle Rodriguez (Letty) was here doing what she does best, playing the hard girl. Even Jordana Brewster (Mia Torreto) who started off in a horror called The Faculty (1998). This flick had so many technical aspects that people who are tuning their cars will get a tuned hard-on from watching this flick. But for me, I wasn't really attracted towards the story. Paul Walker (Brian O'Connor) did well and in fact it's all about him. But that is only clear in part 2. To be honest, it's a no-brainer with some action here and there but also with to many clichés like the cop falling for the sister of the bad one, and having the Stockholm Syndrome towards the end.

31,mm-39,Great preview = bad movie,3,26 June 2001,"When I saw the preview I thought it should be a great car movie.  Problem is the preview looks great, but the movie is awful.  There is a couple of good scenes in the movie, one involving a truck, and the other which I saw on the preview.  Give me a L and a, and a m and a e and you got lame. This film is so lame if it were a dog they would shoot it. The casting is terrible, all the thieves look like they came out of a boy band.  No one could hijack a truck the way they do it  with out every member being squashed.  Hey, a small Honda is not my fantasy racing machine.  Maybe people shoot lower for what they expect in a car.  The lead girl in the film looks homely. Watching a car on nitro go in a straight line does not excite me into believing that is great driving.  I see that everyday next to the highway I live by.  Except for two stunts in the film there is no furious car chasing in this film.  The script is a bunch of situational scenes put together with no overall story to tie the film together.  This film is so bad its not worth renting.",The Fast and the Furious
32,StevePulaski,A fine example of cinematic adrenaline and incredulity,8,8 December 2015,"The Fast and the Furious is, at the very least, an intriguing franchise, for it gives gearheads the kind of inspiration and fantasy they need to have to keep sane. I've always found car hobbyists to face quite the paradox; the problem with cars is that they are grossly expensive, so if you're a middle class man, having two is quite the luxury. However, if you're deep into cars as a fascination, you presumably not only want one or two cars, you want several, and you want them customized and rigged to your liking. Customizing and optimizing the performance on one car is grossly expensive, but having a garage of half a dozen or more customized/optimized vehicles could cost as much as your house and your neighbor's houses put together. This is why, each and every day, I'm more and more satisfied with my lack of interest in cars and my own obsession with the Honda Accord I drive.The Fast and the Furious also gives gearheads that kind of adrenaline rush and visualization of their dreams realized because they, themselves, often don't have the means, the vehicles, nor the kind of closed-range courses to carry out the kind of eye-popping stunts and mayhem the characters in these films cause. It caters to that level of unbridled excitement, when you're actually racing in a vehicle and that moment where you get that indescribable pang in your chest reminding you know that you're alive. I was fully ready to embrace this franchise for its fantastical elements, but unsure if I could still be entertained watching car chases and death-defying stunts for an upwards of two hours.What's pleasant about The Fast and the Furious is that it focuses on the relationships the characters have with one another in the midst of all the racing. The film's slender plot revolves around Brian O'Connors (Paul Walker), an undercover Los Angeles police officer sent to infiltrate a ring of truck hijackers and street racers in the heart of L.A.. Led by Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel), a suave know-it-all when it comes to vehicles, the gang is known for their heavily armed carjacking activities of large eighteen wheelers, in addition to their work at auto-body shops where they modify and customize cars, some of which flirting with and others unabashedly breaking the laws of what is street legal. Also working in Dom's crew are Leticia Ortiz (Michelle Rodriguez), his longtime girlfriend and mechanic at his shop, in addition to his sister Mia Toretto (Jordana Brewster), whom becomes the apple of Brian's eye late in the film.Brian's infiltration of Dom's ring soon becomes corrupted by his fascination with the culture Dom and his crew have created; it's a culture that specializes in prompting and maintaining a longterm adrenaline rush in the most unique and heart-pounding ways. Despite Brian's responsibility to uphold the law through all this, he finds his involvement with Dom going above and beyond the call of the law, as far as hooking up with Dom's sister and helping Dom plot a crackdown of former partners that have turned into rival gangmembers following a reneged agreement.No matter which way you slice it, The Fast and the Furious is slight in substance, but often very strong on a level of entertainment. At only one-hundred minutes, it pleasantly skates by without being too much of an assault on the senses and operates largely on the charm and infectious personalities of its actors. Walker is the standout of the crowd, maintaining a certain level of cool and street-smarts and his character never hitting the level of cocksure confidence, making him a more watchable and likable presence. That's not to undermine Diesel's role here, because without him, this film wouldn't be as much of a bromance as it already is. From the first race, it is clear that Walker and Diesel have enough chemistry to create a bond between two opposite characters in terms of life paths in order to go on many more adventures with one another. The supporting cast of Rodriguez and Brewster are fine, though even in more masculine roles, the two feel like nothing more than decorative pieces of eye-candy that help further the plot along when convenient.But perhaps such was just destined to be the case in The Fast and the Furious, a film where escapist tendencies take over and nothing else matters besides the moment when your car begins to redline or a part becomes misplaced in Dom's garage of odds and ends. Being that this film largely predicates itself on male bonding and the thrill of racing from both an illegal and adrenaline-charged angle, The Fast and the Furious largely possesses a homey quality that makes it believable and grounded in reality, despite a certain conclusion with a certain train that, I confess, was still entertaining in the realm of cinematic incredulity. This is a fun and effective film in being every gearhead's fantasy and being a damn fine piece of entertainment.Starring: Paul Walker, Vin Diesel, Michelle Rodriguez, and Jordana Brewster.

I was in high school at the time and I remember the weekend that it opened strangely enough, and I remember the Monday at school, all the guys were just screaming how cool this film was, how ""badass"" it was, it was so ridicules. So, I decided to steer clear of the fast and the furious films, it just seemed like a waste of time. But recently one of my friends told me that I should give these movies a chance. So I decided to go ahead and see what they were about, plus I had a coupon for a free rental and there was nothing else better to watch it seemed. So I watched the first two fast and the furious films this afternoon, and for the first film, I have to say that it lived up to everything I would've expected.Brian is a cop in LA and is going undercover into the deep dark pimp my ride world of street racing. He meets the head of the LA races, Dominic, who has a gang of people who are loyal drivers and race for money, also a sister who Brian falls for, what a shock, huh? But there's bad news, there is a rival race gang in the area, The Fast And The Furious became quickly from an action movie to a mystery thriller of who's gang is trying to get the major pimp your ride engines for money. So Brian of course starts to like the gang and wants to become one of them, what another shock.When it comes down to it The Fast and the Furious is the most predictable and horribly written piece of a film you could think of. I don't understand how others, besides a teenage guy, could get into these films. I shouldn't have rented the sequels, just because now I have to watch them to get my money's worth :P But I think it is just silly all the major over the top special effects, it has a pointless plot as well as it's sexist. I'm not saying that to be a pain in the butt, but all the women in this film were used as mostly sex objects, they had no development. But I guess that's what to expect from a film like The Fast and the Furious. Oh, well, at least I could say I saw these films.4/10",The Fast and the Furious

35,MovieAddict2016,Fast cars? Yes. Good plot? No. Worth Watching For the Sake of the Cars? Maybe. You Decide.,5,1 August 2002,"The Fast and the Furious is a pure adrenaline filled action movie. A real tough guy film. Fast cars, great stunts. The works. Unfortunately, this can't completely make up for the other mistakes.  The casting of the Fast and the Furious was pretty bad. Vin Diesel can't act. People like him because he's tough. Some said he's the next Schwarzenegger. Yeah right. However, that's not what ruined the film. It's simply everyone else. Paul Walker is horrible especially. Michelle Rodriguez (Resident Evil) is okay. She was better in Resident evil. Somehow though, all these combinations were horrible. The plot itself is just stupid. Anyone seeing this should focus on the stunts and cars, because obviously that's what the director did. I mean, it's one of the most predictable movies ever. And the ending was pretty dumb(though not as bad as it could be.) Another thing about THE FAST AND THE FURIOUS is the rating. The rating board must have been pressured by the company who released THE FAST AND THE FURIOUS into a PG-13, because this film should've been rated R. I was reading a review a critic wrote, and he said that two male teenagers in front of him said, ""Man, that should've been rated R."" The critic said he couldn't agree more. Same here. Not even the small amount of violence in this film should make it R, but the language(I counted at least 3 F words), and the street racing. After this movie was released I saw on the news that some percentage of car accidents had gone up. I forget how much though.
Still, does all this make the FAST AND THE FURIOUS a pass? You can decide for yourself on your own taste. I personally, even if it was stupid, am glad for watching it just for the races, cars, and the HUGE stunt at the end. Other than that, I wouldn't watch it. But if you like cars and stunts, and really big, adrenaline pumped guy movies, than I wouldn't pass THE FAST AND THE FURIOUS UP just for the stupid stuff. It's not incredibly bad, because the above I mentioned makes up for it. It's a hard vote, but I'll give it a 3. Not for a film as a whole, but for the small sequences I loved in it. 3/5 stars.",The Fast and the Furious

37,KineticSeoul,The start of a franchise that revolve around cars and a big break for two actors,7,28 April 2011,"This movie was a big hit when it first came out in theaters, especially with it's budget. It's actually pretty obvious why this movie was so popular, mainly because of the suped up cars with girls and some aggressive racing and bits of action. In another words this is a popcorn flick for most guys and despite the plot not being that good, it still has elements which keeps the movie from being boring or dull. It's one of those movies where it's better to shut off your brain and just accept that entertaining and yet stupid stuff happening on screen in order to have a good time with it. This is also the movie where Vin Diesel and Paul Walker got their big break, and so this movie is the biggest thing that has probably ever happened to them especially when it comes to being in the movie industry. So yeah basically to sum it up, this is a film with a passable plot but has some thrill rides to go with it. Overall the execution was well done, it's a stupid/cheesy flick and yet it's cool and entertaining.

39,Robert_duder,Mainstream fluff but this first instalment works for them,8,8 December 2013,"The first Fast and Furious movie I stumbled into by accident was Tokyo Drift and much to my surprise I loved it. So now because I have heard so much about how great the latest instalment was I have been going back and watching them all. The first film certainly has a strong appeal to it. Car movies are not necessarily my thing, I don't know a lick about cars except how to drive (and my wife would say even that is questionable.) Still the original film in this series also is one of the only ones I have seen outside of Tokyo Drift that is still truly about fast cars and racing. The series eventually evolves into more of a heist/criminal underworld sort of spin but this is truly about the cars. Right off the bat you're dropped into the action and there is some truly excellent action scenes. The characters are not brilliant but they are well defined and interesting despite being very predictable and stereotypical. One thing the Fast Furious series forces down your throats is the idea that this group is a ""family"" and will do anything for each other. They start this concept in this movie and then repeat it over and over and over again. A smarter series would let you feel that devotion and friendship with character development. But it is what it is, a simple action flick that entertains.This cast has made their bread and butter with this series. Vin Diesel is a star from this series and a few other roles but mostly this. He fits into it like a round peg into a round hole. He is a good anti-hero and his rough tough as nails charisma works in the movie. Paul Walker also made his name in this series. He is the yin to Diesel's yang. He is softer spoken, the red blooded all American type who is undercover within this gang and becomes one of the family. Walker is a little stiff in his performance and he certainly isn't flexing any major acting muscles but he is a necessity to the story and his chemistry with Diesel works very well. Jordana Brewster is Diesel's sister and Walker's love interest and she does decently. Her character gets very little development but she has a purpose and serves it well. Her chemistry with Walker is solid and their romance is definitely worthwhile. Michelle Rodriguez is Diesel's love interest and I think they actually have great chemistry, very hot on screen but she is very underused in this movie. I was surprised she got such a name from being in this because she is definitely a supporting character and way in the background most of the time. Rick Yune is decent but completely underused and under developed as the ""villain"" o sorts. He could have been much better but the character is too weak. Chad Linberg does a terrific job in a very small role and gives one of the stronger performances especially in a supporting role.The film relies entirely on its stunts, fast cars and action scenes. The cast and performances are adequate at best but thanks to a constant stream of adrenaline it ends up being very entertaining. Rob Cohen has a history as a director of relying on adrenaline to make his films. He might be one of the most shallow directors in the way that his movies have very, very little depth. These films, especially this one, is the definition of mindless entertainment. You have to turn off your brain and sit back and enjoy the spectacle. I'm not in any way saying there is anything wrong with that because I was thoroughly entertained. I don't quite understand the massive following this series has but this time I was pleased with the film so what can I say. Be ready to be entertained but not overly impressed. 8/10",The Fast and the Furious

This is the movie that spawned a dynasty of sorts and encouraged numerous little boy and girl racers the world over to turn up the gas. It's a crime caper with a fetish, not just for sleek, fast cars, but for handsome men with buffed up torsos, (the 'attraction' between leads Paul Walker and Vin Diesel makes this possibly the most homoerotic movie of its decade). Ironically, and tragically, Walker himself was to die in a motor accident several films down the line.There isn't a frame of this nonsense you can believe in and the driving sequences, which make up most of the movie, are the stuff of fantasy.

41,ThomasDrufke,A Guilty Pleasure Movie at its Finest,7,4 April 2017,"16 years and 7 films ago the Fast & Furious franchise wasn't the worldwide phenomena that it is now. It was once a cheesy Point Break rip-off that took itself way too seriously. But you know what, it was a darn good guilty pleasure movie. That's for sure.A lot has changed over the years in the series, but the one constant has always been that the films are about family. For all its faults, no one can deny how well this film does the family angle. It's not the best acting, writing, or directing, but you care enough about the characters to where you believe the motivations behind characters' actions regarding family. But let's talk about how ridiculous, stupid, and fun this movie is.They drive their cars (successfully) underneath semi-trucks several times throughout the film. So much so that when I was younger I believed it was possible. That word, ""possible"", will be used sparingly through the course of this film and the entire series. Where Furious 7 pushes the boundaries of reality by driving cars via one building to the next, The Fast and the Furious provides the unbelievable through street car races with seemingly a few hundred people. In the middle of the night, that is. Oh and those hundreds of people each have their own car and parking spot, that is. But that won't be the last time the film could have you roll your eyes.In fact, it's way easier to watch this film now that I've seen every installment to date. This film is extremely dated, but it's an interesting watch, especially considering where the series has gone to now. There's an underground motorcycle gang who steals DVD players and stashes them in a Thai-food restaurant. The climax of the film begins at an event called Race Wars. Creative huh? At one point, Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) tells someone to back off or she will scar her face with tire tracks. I guess my point is, if you don't accept the film for what it is, I don't think you'll have any fun with it.The real joy of this film comes by its goofiest and most outlandish moments, but also with its impressive stunts and action. In camera stunts may be this franchise's finest assets, and the last highway heist in this film is a thing of beauty. Yes, the film gets bogged down by a really dated and contrived script, but there's so much undeniable fun to be had here. A guilty pleasure movie at its best+Stunts/action+All about family+Ridiculously goofy/fun-Horrible script, and passable acting-Takes itself a little too serious at times7.5/10",The Fast and the Furious
42,g-bodyl,Get Ready to Race!!!!!,10,1 May 2009,"Since this movie came out, I had no intentions to see this. This movie looked like a dud in my eyes. But, since the fourth one came out with mainly positive reviews, I decided to take my chances. This is one of the better racing movies you will ever see. I enjoyed watching this film.This film is about street-racing. Basically, a undercover FBI agent hooks up with a street racing gang to find criminals and love. The thing is, he enjoys street racing more than being an agent.Tons of people are saying that the acting is terrible, but I disagree. Vin Diesel played what he does best, a macho guy, and Paul Walker did a really good job. I will also say that the two girls, Brewster and Rodriguez are hot.If you like hip-hop, you will like the music. You will feel your energy rate soar through the roof along with the transmission. Great effects, too.Overall, this is a much better movie than I anticipated. I rate this movie 10/10.",The Fast and the Furious

45,ironhorse_iv,This movie is driving me crazy. It's an awful skid mark on film.,5,15 May 2013,"The Fast and the Furious is just a movie with gas fumes of half-baked ideas for a popcorn flick. The movie is simple mindless full of hot chicks and fast cars. 'Petrolheads' probably did like it as it was the sleeper hit of 2001, and spawned many sequels. Still, the movie had mixed reviews, and in my opinion, they didn't go all the way in entertaining the kind of audience this movie was aimed towards. In the movie, there were few street races and not to mention the fact that the street racing element is just dressing for a bland, generic plot of thieves stealing commercial goods. If I went to go see a racing movie, and found myself watching a Point Break (1991) rip-off. I would be disappointed. The story goes like this, rather than having intense full-throttle action fun, awesome high-speed stunts, and full-on pedal to the metal intensity, the movie goes into another direction by having an undercover cop, Brian (Paul Walker) infiltrates an underworld subculture of Los Angeles street racers looking to bust them for stealing goods. He soon befriends the leader of the group, Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) and begins to question if he should turn him in, or let him free for one last ride. The movie is supposed to be fast and the furious, but it's not- it's slow pace like a grandma driving in the fast lace in the highway. The limit racing in this movie are over so quickly they're just boring as the movie puts countless amounts of filler scenes of talking that don't further the plot. There are unfinished sub plots. The movie spend all that time developing a love interest, and then you aren't going to let us know what happens? What the hell, movie! I know the movie was going to be for the low-brow, so I didn't expect a life lesson, I want to entertain. This movie was flat out lackluster. There's not enough action. The movie has a lot of flash, but the characters are dull and not interesting enough, with cars replace for personalities. That is, of course, with the exception of Toretto, who thanks to that scene about his dad and Diesel's performance, shines above the material. Still Diesel's acting is mediocre, at best. I presumed they were going to sell them off for upgrades to their cars and bikes, like Toretto was doing with his stolen goods. It's not made clear, though. It doesn't make much sense, either. The cars in the film are not that real to the real deal. Doing a wheelie while burning the the rubber on the rear tires of a 900hp Charger at the same time is simply not possible. First of all, don't expect any kind of realism from this movie. I was dumbfounded when the Brian's Honda floorboard came out of his passenger side when he used his nitrous boost and then his engine blew smoke. Next scene, after this, he picks up someone who was running from the cops with his car and drove away as if it's brand new. I didn't know Brian's puke green car came with a healing factor modified in his engine. What is with each of the ""underground street races"" have so many spectators on long streets block off. Not once, you think the police would just look for a large street block off and arrested them. The women in this movie are just drop dead hot, but it's weird for them to be hanging out at underground racing. I don't see many women there, at less not as hot as Jordana Brewster. The movie is supposed to be about Import-car racing which is a spectacle started by Asian American auto enthusiasts. How does ""The Fast and the Furious"" pay tribute to the sport's Asian American heritage? Make them the villains in the film. The movie has a lot of loud noises, and soundtrack full of the worst music artist at the time, Limp Bizkit and Ja Rule. The techno rock is a bit annoying. Like the 1955 film, The Fast and the Furious which is not based on, but took the title rights from, this movie is less for smart adults and more for kids who shell out money to pimp their car and add a 4"" diameter exhaust to it, thinking it's cool. Don't get me wrong, I love cars, but you don't see me endangering other drivers by driving fast illegally on city urban street. I like driving fast in the country side where it's less dangerous for other drivers. I think the movie glorified the illegal street racing way too much that it's a bit unhealthy. I think the movie is a bit far fetch from reality where most illegal street racers end up getting killed due to crashes or other car racers car-jacking your car before you can race. So it's not worth it. People like seeing cars go vroom and potential cause untold amounts of property damage. That must be it. Still, there are better movies than this. Go see the chase scenes in Bullitt (1975), the French Connection (1979) or Ronin. (1998). Even modern movies like Drive (2011) are better than this movie. If you have to watch the movies, go rent it, don't buy it. I wouldn't advice thinking too much into this, it's just mindless popcorn flick and also don't complain if you hate it, cause I did warn you about seeing it. It's still driving me up the wall.",The Fast and the Furious
46,The-Sarkologist,Pretty Substandard and full of clichés,3,2 December 2016,"At first this movie came across as being really really boring and completely unoriginal. However, after watching it for a little more it because a little better, but it was still incredibly unoriginal and in the end just an excuse for illegal car races and some good old action scenes, which actually weren't all that fantastic either. Okay, sure, there were some stunts, such as jumping from a car onto a truck and back again, but that doesn't mean that the film was any good. Well, the fact that it has since spawned six sequels indicates that there is money to be made out of the franchise, but then again that isn't all that surprising because it does involve racing cars and a bit of typical action thrown in for good measure.So, the film is basically about illegal drag racing in Los Angeles with a plot thrown in. The plot involves trucks being hijacked by a bunch of people in cars and the contents of the trucks being stolen. So, surprise surprise, a cop is sent to go undercover into the world of drag racing to find out what is actually going on, and to make an arrest. However, surprise surprise, he ends up getting a but too caught up in the scene, and the people that he is working with, and eventually has to make a call – his career or his friends.This is pretty typical of your American cop movie, raising the concept that being an undercover cop isn't actually all that easy. Mind you, this is pretty glamourised as well, especially with them operating out of a rather flash house that they have confiscated. Okay, I'm not really sure how undercover cops actually work, though apparently they do go in pretty deep, and will even do things that are effectively illegal. Whether they actually get too emotionally involved, or even end up going off with the bad guys is another story all together.As for the film, well, it is what I would call your typical 'guy' film, and more so a typical 'young guy' film – you have fast, and hotted up cars, lots of girls that are scantily clad, which is pretty typical of this type of movie, and Hollywood in general. Personally it really isn't a scene that I am all that into, and I am not sure why I am all that keen on actually watching any more of them, however I do have this desire to do just that so I guess I will see how this series pans out. Oh, and the car races are pretty ordinary as well.",The Fast and the Furious
47,jacobjohntaylor1,Just a bonch of hype,4,6 March 2017,This is not very good. The characters make chooses that do not make sense. The story line is awful. 2 fast 2 furious is a good movie. The fast and the furious Tokyo drift is also a good movie. Fast and the furious new model original parts is also a good movie. Fast five is also a good movie. Fast and the Furious 6 is also a good movie. Furious 7 is also a good movie. The best thing about this movie is if it had not been made the sequels would not have been made. 6.7 is overrating it. That is not a great film. I give 4. This is pretty bad. D.R no is a lot better. I like most action movies. I do not like this one. D.R no is great.

48,slightlymad22,Rehash Of Point Break With Street Racers Instead Of Surfers,7,20 February 2015,"I had never actually seen this movie. I had seen most of the second one (I found it OK) watched the third one (was bored to tears) and I lost interest in the franchise before I was dragged to see the 6th movie, which despite not knowing a lot of character development, I enjoyed.However prior to the 7th movie being released, SkyMovies are showing all the movies, so I decided to see what I had missed out on!! Plot In A Paragraph: LA street racer Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) falls under the suspicion of the LAPD for a string of high-speed electronics truck robberies. Brian O'Connor (Paul Walker) an officer of the LAPD, joins the ranks of Toretto's highly skilled racing crew undercover to convict Toretto. However, O'Connor finds himself both enamored with this new world and in love with Toretto's sister, Mia (Jordana Brewster) As a rival racing crew gains strength, O'Connor must decide where his loyalties really lie.Although essentially ""Point Break"" with street racers instead of surfers, this is easily the best movie of the franchise (of the movies I have seen) not surprising with it being the first (they usually the best) As with ""Point Break"" the villain (Patrick Swayze in ""Point Break"") is much more interesting than the hero. Vin Diesel has charisma in spades, Paul Walker is likable and an attractive enough lead, Michelle Rodriguez is tough and sexy whilst Jordana Brewster is absolutely gorgeous. The racing scenes and action set pieces are well directed, the dialogue is a bit weak and cliché at times but overall this is a lot of fun.",The Fast and the Furious

Then got turned sideways and got stuck up in a New York City's garbage dump back side.
Then they added more WWE Grapplers to it.Please no more. At least I'll say this the 1st one was at least barely decent. Then they added like 5 more. Why? FAF is not good.Verdict: For the Too Slow and the too terrible.This movie is a 5 the series is a good 2.",The Fast and the Furious

(Since number 6, the films became overblown on all levels almost to the point of becoming fantasy or superhero movies, and I lost interest). The incredibly awesome cars are bound to give car enthusiasts an instant orgasm. They are STUNNING!Paul Walker plays a cop who goes undercover to infiltrate a team of street racers, suspected of hijacking trucks and stealing their goods. As luck would have it - surprise, surprise - he falls for the leader's sister. The leader being Dom, portrayed by Vin Diesel.

Not that I didn't enjoy the 90 minutes of homoerotic machismo, endless gear-stick changes, scantily-clad gyrators and a cameo by Ja Rule - I actually found it highly entertaining in a Point Break (1991) sort-of-way - it's just that how much of an audience can a film about cars draw? Lots, it would seem.Undercover L.A.P.D. officer Brian O'Connor (Paul Walker) is assigned to infiltrate a gang of street-racers led by the notorious Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) after a series of high-speed truck hijackings using pimped-out Honda Civics. A highly competent driver himself, Brian uses his skills to befriend Dominic, while falling for his sister Mia (Jordana Brewster). After saving Dominic from the police, Brian earns his respect but not that of his crew, and when Dominic proves himself generous and loyal to those who offer him the same, Brian must choose between protecting his new friend and arresting the criminal he has been assigned to bring down.The Fast and the Furious' script is often bad enough to make your ears bleed. This is a film where words of wisdom are offered in the form of ""it's not how you stand by your car, it's how you race your car,"". But it's delivers on what the title promises, and the action scenes are well-staged and it's nice to see real metal bend and break in an increasingly CGI-reliant marketplace. It's loud and often crude, but the two leads of obvious limited acting range prove likable and actually generate some chemistry.

Vin Diesel makes a really good interpretation as Dominic Toretto who plays as a street racer. Also good interpretations made in this movie by Jordana Brewster (Mia Toretto) who plays as Dominic Toretto's sister and Michelle Rodriguez (Letty) who plays as the girlfriend of Dominic Toretto.I liked very much ""The Fast and the Furious"" movie because it shows us how is to be in this world of super cars, races, speed and all of that stuff, and makes you also feel all of these one by one.",The Fast and the Furious
55,Floated2,One of a kind of the series,7,8 September 2010,"There's a good love story wrapped around the manifolds and superchargers.Its about a series of truck high-jacks has brought in a squad of undercover cops to deal with the problem and they do so by sending Officer Brian Earl Spilner (real name Brian O'Conner) (Paul Walker) to infiltrate the number one racing clan. It's led by Dominic ""Dom"" Toretto (Vin Diesel), the fastest and strongest among 'em. O'Conner starts his quest by demonstrating his hangup with speedy metal, then by hanging around Dom's bar, which Dom's sister Mia (Jordana Brewster) runs and bartends. In the course of events he loses his ride, saves Dom's life and some embarrassment, hooks up with Mia, and learns to respect Dom in ways he never expected.The racing sequences are brought off with considerable energy and as an expression of this culture but are weakened by a plot device contrived to give the races and the racers a dynamic advantage. The movie had a decent plot but the writing and dialogue was poor. Many people consider the first one the best of the series and I agree with them on some levels. Though had the writing and dialogue been better, this film would have been much better. Also they could have used better character development and better acting. Its a film centered at a specific group. Meaning not for everyone. As a rewatch 06/03/19', the original Fast and the Furious shows how everything was set up.

58,Movie_Muse_Reviews,One of the 'better' cool car style-focused action flicks of the turn of the century,6,26 March 2017,"""The Fast and The Furious"" was the ""Point Break"" of the 2000s — a cop goes undercover to bust up a group of criminals who are into a specific ""sport,"" but he becomes attached to the very people he's trying to bust. ""Point Break"" is the better film, but ""The Fast and the Furious"" was the start of a multi-billion-dollar franchise. Go figure.Paul Walker plays the cop, Brian O'Conner, but the screenplay doesn't reveal this card until Brian has not only won the respect of top street racer Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel), but also the viewer. This small betrayal of our trust is writer Gary Scott Thompson's shrewdest move as the film goes from somewhat interesting, albeit cliché, to more interesting, albeit cliché.The screenplay — co-written with Erik Bergquist and David Ayer (""Training Day"") based on the ""VIBE"" magazine article by Ken Li — is not the focal point of the movie, of course. This was 2001, the peak of the MTV Spring Break era. The point was to show hot foreign cars, hot foreign (and American) women and a lot of burning rubber. The rock, rap and techno music of the time feature prominently, and even rapper Ja Rule had a supporting role as a racer, a reminder of how the start of the 21st century was also the beginning of the music business starting to infiltrate the movie business.All this to say, director Rob Cohen understands this is a style over substance situation. Quarter-mile races, chases, fist fights and criminal heist activity are the featured attractions — as are the beautiful cars and beautiful people. If this film can be given any credit for originality, it belongs to the merging of heist/crime movie and drag race aesthetics. Cars had of course been featured in movies and television before, but this movie more authentically plays to the car aficionado, as a handful of films did in this era (e.g. ""Gone in 60 Seconds,"" ""The Italian Job""). There's a certain grittiness that this film has featuring real street-racing cars compared to James Bond, for example, driving something too cool to believe.The movie isn't 100 percent shallow from start to finish, however. A genuine effort is made to build chemistry between Walker and Diesel's characters. The story works best when it builds and tests that relationship. Nothing else about the movie feels worth our investment, but somehow we desperately do not want Brian and Dom to turn on each other despite all the reasons they should. Both Walker and Diesel bring likable dimensions to their characters and their chemistry is likely to be the bedrock of future films. (This coming from someone who has yet to see any of the other films yet.)The supporting cast, however, doesn't offer much. Dom's girlfriend, Letty (Michelle Rodriguez), brings nothing to the story, and the other guys in Dom's gang aren't given the chance to be anything but meatheads. The romance between Brian and Dom's sister Mia (Jordana Brewster) exists for formulaic reasons, but the fact that both of them feel kind of like outsiders to the street-racing culture gives their relationships some legitimacy.But enough about characters. ""The Fast and the Furious"" delivers some solid action sequences, especially the ones involving street cars and semi trucks. The racing scenes don't allow for much dimension, and the editing is decent to optimize suspense, but the CGI and green screen elements pull us out of what should feel like a very realistic, gritty street race. There are enough quality moments for action fans in ""The Fast and the Furious"" to overcome the MTV Spring Break music video world its characters inhabit. The 2000s were full of glossy movies with inferior story lines, and while comparing ""The Fast and the Furious"" to these films would obviously make it seem like a great movie when in fact it's an average one, it could be a suitable enough ambassador of its time and culture to movie watchers of the future.~Steven CThanks for reading!

59,Anonymous_Maxine,At least someone finally found a use for all of those ridiculous cars...,4,17 July 2001,"Yes, The Fast and the Furious is exactly what the previews showed. A bunch of real charmers who race around in those ridiculous cars that you always see driving down the road, desperately trying to be cool. Here you have a gang of guys with seemingly endless financial ability to pack into these cars every kind of racing part imaginable, but the difference between these and the cars you see bouncing down the road in your local town is that they actually race these ones. The story is made up of the old cop undercover as one of the stylish bad guys, but it just doesn't work here. If you want to see a good movie with a plot like that, watch Point Break.
Paul Walker plays Brian, the undercover cop in question, and Vin Diesel is Dominic Toretto, the leader of the gang that Brian is trying to infiltrate as he investigates a string of truck hijackings that are being perpetrated by a trio of extremely recognizable Hondas. Why would anyone in their right mind do so many robberies all with cars that have green lights underneath them? Is that just so that, when they get caught, the police will have no trouble linking them with every truck they've ever robbed? Not smart, guys. And besides that, you wouldn't think they'd feel too confident driving next to an 18-wheeler in a little tiny Honda.(spoilers) And the, of course, you have the goofball romance. Brian falls in love with Mia, Dominic's sister, which complicates his job. Dominic himself confuses us by being the biggest badass in this whole gang of racers while dating the ugliest and bitchiest girl in the entire movie. The first race scene in the film is among the funniest scenes, because it involves four cars racing at 140-odd mph down the streets of Los Angeles, with hundreds of on-lookers. I love how they can do this without worrying about traffic or police, I guess that one guy with the police scanner was all that would be needed for such an extravaganza. Also look for director Rob Cohen as the pizza guy who shows up briefly in this scene. As far as traffic, they must have scanners for that, too, because you'll notice a total absence of any kind of traffic during the truck robberies. And it sure is nice of the truck drivers to drive smoothly and keep speed with the Hondas while they shoot crossbows into the cab and pull out the windshield. This is an action movie for car people, because it is all about the kind of cars that these people fantasize about owning, for some reason. You can see the real version of this movie playing on main streets of towns all over the world, I'm sure. In Fresno, California, for example you can drive down Blackstone Avenue at 1am on a Saturday night, and in every other empty parking lot you'll see 10 or 12 guys standing forlornly around 2 or 3 cars that desperately try to look like the cars in this movie, and this is the reality that The Fast and the Furious exaggerates and tries to make glamorous - a bunch of guys trying to be cool by standing next to cars that are full of racing equipment that they don't use. The Fast and the Furious is all about the Hollywood version of these guys, traveling around in packs and driving cars with tremendously souped-up engines, carrying thick wads of rubber band-bound cash in their shirt pockets, and spending the night life with women borrowed from the rock stars while they revel in the tremendous financial spoils of the race wars. While it is almost amusingly obvious how fake this all is, the movie doesn't pretend to be anything else. You know on your way in that this is an action film with a low IQ, and in that sense, the movie does deliver. The chase scenes are unmistakably exciting, however unrealistic they are, and it's fun to watch this whole plot about this idiot cop who recklessly tries to make his way into this gang. The end of the film is utter nonsense, with Brian finally reaching his goal that he has been seeking and risking his life for during the entire film, and he gives it up as soon as he achieves it. It ends with Dominic in his dad's old race car, the one that he's always been afraid to drive, and he is at a stop light remembering that it's exactly a quarter of a mile to that railroad crossing up ahead. The movie once again proves how much it borrowed from Point Break as he decides to race this car to that crossing, and Brian inexplicably decides to race along-side him. They barely escape from the oncoming train, as was to be expected, and then just after Dominic wrecks his father's car, Brian gives him the keys to his own car (the one provided to him by the police for his undercover work), and the film ends just before the police arrive on the scene to strip Brian of his badge send him back to the community college. The Fast and the Furious is a movie for immature action fans, the type who regard Van Damme films as their favorites, but it is almost worth watching just for the racing scenes. All of these scenes are overblown in some way, but they are almost always entertaining, at least on some morbidly amusing level. Luckily, you already know the type of drivel that this movie is, so at least you will be in the right state of mind when you watch it.",The Fast and the Furious
60,Vartiainen,Surprisingly good,7,4 May 2020,"Officer Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker) goes undercover in the Los Angeles street racing circuits in order to find out which of the racing crews is committing crimes with their muscle cars. But going undercover is never easy, especially with such affable miscreants.The basic premise is really nothing special. But then again, it doesn't need to be. The point of this movie is in its style. It has fast cars, lots of racing, lots of hot, greased-up babes, muscle-heavy men (and cars) and a killer soundtrack. You don't watch it to be intrigued by carefully orchestrated plot points or tragic backstories or the heaviness of its pathos. No, you watch it to kick back, relax and have a good time.And in delivering that, the movie more than delivers. But if it was just that, I'd probably rate the film a bit lower. What actually elevates this film above its immediate peers and helped launch a huge franchise, is the fact that this film is punching above its weight class and succeeding. And it does that by having some real good actors playing roles they were born to play. Walker is one of them, but I also have to mention Vin Diesel and Michelle Rodriguez.The dialogue is also surprisingly snappy and memorable. The plot, while basic, succeeds in making you care for these characters, and it also manages to make itself feel novel, despite arguably being at least a little clichéd. Once again, the fact that you care for these characters matters a lot.Not a groundbreaking movie by any means, but it has surprising quality underneath all the testosterone being forcibly pumped into your veins.",The Fast and the Furious
61,freemantle_uk,Wonderfully Dated,4,16 May 2021,"2001's The Fast and the Furious was the film that launched a billion-dollar franchise. After seeing the film it was remarkable that it went past one film. It was a more low key film considering how ridiculous The Fast and the Furious franchise became, it was more a crime film with street racing and was pretty much a remake of Point Break. It was a wonderfully dated film because the soundtrack was filled with techno, Ja Rule hip-hop and nu-metal.",The Fast and the Furious
62,PWNYCNY,It's more than just an action movie.,9,24 October 2011,"This is a great movie. Far from being superficial pulp, this movie has a complex plot. Vin Diesel's performance is tremendous; his screen presence is dominating. He succeeds in carrying the movie. Although the movie contains lots of glitz, it also tells a story that deals with themes such as loyalty and betrayal. The rest of the cast is excellent too, especially Jordana Brewster and Paul Walker. Michelle Rodriguez is as usual wonderful. It would be easy to dismiss this movie as being little more than a live action cartoon, but the movie really is full of surprises. It has several intensely dramatic scenes, some of the most incredible car chase scenes, and some deeply esoteric verbal exchanges fraught with emotion. Whether it's Vin Diesel pouting or Paul Walker being heroic, the results are same: nonstop action, intense dialog, and interesting characters, all of which together produce great entertainment. It's more than just about automobiles.",The Fast and the Furious
63,dee.reid,High-Octane Entertainment,8,24 January 2002,"The summer of 2001 was filled with a countless number of action flicks that for the most part were successful.  ""The Fast and the Furious"" was one of them.  Some of the previews for this movie which have Limp Bizkit's ""My Way"" or Ja Rule's ""Furious"" playing in the background can lead you to expect a no-holds-barred film with relentless action scenes that are made to get the adrenaline pumping.  ""The Fast and the Furious"" for the most part has all of that.  The acting here is pretty good despite the fact this is a summer action film.  Vin Diesel is already on his way to super-stardom as is Paul Walker.  The racing scenes are excellently done but look a lot more like something out of a really hot Playstation 2 game, as someone pointed out earlier at this site.Now for the bad parts.  The storyline sucks mainly because we saw it in another movie that was released nearly ten years before ""The Fast and the Furious"".  That movie was ""Point Break"" which just so happened to star Patrick Swayze and Keanu Reeves.  The plotlines for both films are almost identical.  I'm going to do this in comparison style with ""The Fast and the Furious"" first and ""Point Break"" second.  ""The Fast and the Furious/Point Break"" both have rookie cops(Paul Walker/Keanu Reeves) going undercover(LA street racing scene/LA surfing scene) to find the culprits behind several daring heists(truck heists/bank robberies).  The cops both fall in love with someone close to the suspected ring leader(Jordana Brewster/Lori Petty). The endings for both films pretty much leave the door open for sequels but is more likely with ""The Fast and the Furious"" than it is ""Point Break"". None of these complaints however, really had an effect on my viewing pleasure.  Lastly, what the hell happened to Ja Rule?  His performance seems to be more a lot more of a cameo than a small role.  He's only in one scene in the whole movie(the first racing scene) and I expected him to at least be in more scenes.    Well ""The Fast and the Furious"" gets an 8/10 despite the absence of Ja Rule.",The Fast and the Furious

Paul Walker gets his breakout role as an undercover cop, one with very little interest in actually doing any police work, who falls in with a crew of enterprising gear heads on the midnight street racing circuit. Vin Diesel, the headline costar, takes on his usual character: a growling, flexing, ultra-chill bro with shady connections but an open heart. Neither are particularly likable or interesting.The whole thing is shallower than a toilet bowl, ticking so many ""cool point"" boxes that it mimics a rich, forgettable, three-minute music video. We've got fast cars, gorgeous sex objects, adrenaline-rich action scenes, loud radio hits (juuust a bit dated) and a posh location or two. Not much in the way of meaningful character arcs or deeper substance.It's a true ""what you see is what you get"" experience. Big and dumb and gruff and insecure, with a plot that varies from meaningless to pointless and a versatile cast with nothing to do beyond gripping the steering wheel (or each other) and looking sexy. On this first go-around, at least, the action retains some passing association with reality. Points for that.",The Fast and the Furious
66,MaxBorg89,"Shallow as hell, but fun to watch",7,19 November 2006,"If you watch The Fast and the Furious for the script and the acting, you will be disappointed. This movie has no intention of being a Michael Mann-like philosophical action movie. It's just a silly ride that will entertain for a couple of hours without any real emotional impact on the viewer. I knew this right from the start, which is why I enjoyed The Fast and the Furious.Actually, I'm being a bit unfair, since there is one respectable performance in the film: Vin Diesel's career-making portrayal of Dominic Toretto, who is the undisputed king of L.A.'s illegal street racing. That is, until a cocky guy named Brian (Paul Walker) shows up to challenge him. Naturally, Dom wins, but in the meantime he's made friends with the newcomer, who saves his life when the cops show up.As we learn soon after-wards, though, it's all a set-up: Brian is a cop himself, going undercover to find out whether Dom is involved in a series of truck hijackings.In the hands of a better director, the movie could have been an interesting character study, with the addition of a few mandatory action sequences. Rob Cohen, however, treats the script like an excuse to stage a bunch of visually spectacular race scenes. Those scenes, as well as Diesel's charismatic presence, make The Fast and the Furious fun enough to watch, but not good enough to remember. In fact, there aren't enough elements to justify the film's transformation into a franchise. But focusing on these aspects is pointless: just take the movie for what it is (a good-looking, if shallow summer blockbuster) and enjoy it. Otherwise, watch something better.7,5/10",The Fast and the Furious
67,Fluke_Skywalker,Aptly named,7,2 July 2015,"I hadn't seen this since '01, and frankly I wasn't all that impressed at the time. So much so that I skipped 2 and 3, and watched 4 only because it had solid buzz. And then of course the franchise evolved from a 'Point Break' rip-off (and I mean beat for beat) with street racing substituted for surfing into Ocean's Eleven for the Red Bull generation. After enjoying the fifth one on DVD I actually caught the last two at the theater and had a blast both times. So with all that in mind, I revisited the original with some trepidation. How would a movie I obviously didn't care much for the first time hold up against its more popcorn-style sequels? The answer; surprisingly well. Though it lacks the over the top action of the more recent films, the movie itself moves along at a brisk clip. Diesel and Walker have really good chemistry, with the former really carrying the flick on his V-neck clad shoulders (much as his 'Point Break' counterpart Patrick Swayze did). Diesel's Dominic Toretto has become a rather somber, mumbly character of late, but here he's downright jaunty by comparison. I'm not afraid to say that Paul Walker was a ridiculously good looking man, and honestly that may have worked against him a bit. He never did get much respect for his acting, and while I wouldn't say he was exactly Brando, he did well when he was in his wheelhouse, and this is directly in said wheelhouse.It's not going to win any awards for originality or brains, but like many of the films in this franchise, it's a lot of fun.",The Fast and the Furious

The actors all have exactly one expression - anger - and they never stray far from that.  I think they all took the second half of the title too seriously.  Why are they furious anyway?  What do they have to be furious about? Paul Walker literally sleepwalks through the entire movie and if Vin Diesel is the new action hero for the new generation, I want a recount.  I liked Jordana Brewster a lot in ""The Faculty"" and was looking forward to seeing her in this, but she's wasted.  Michelle Rodriguez is cementing her future as a tough girl doing movies like this - wasn't she in that female boxing movie too?The only positive thing I can say is that the movie seems to have some respect for its audience.  By being rated PG-13, at least the people who would most benefit (!) from seeing this garbage would be allowed in.

77,breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com,The film that made a lot of actors popular,7,13 January 2014,"Upon first reading the title, viewers would get the first impression that this film involves just racing cars. In a sense, it does but in a different way than your standard track race of 99 laps. It involves much more than that and to demonstrate this, a cast of actors were chosen for this franchise that have taken the genre of driving cars to the next level. This is the movie that brought several no name actors to the spotlight. The most obvious is Vin Diesel and Paul Walker. And what almost seemed like would be a strange mashup of racing and detective work, turned out to be a fairly solid film.Paul Walker plays Brian O'Conner, an undercover cop who is trying to help the FBI capture a group of road bandits who end up plundering innocent truck drivers traveling down highways. To do this, he digs deep into the underworld of street racing where racers of different backgrounds and revved up cars come together for a common cause. The thrill of the ride and all the benefits that come with it; sex, drugs, respect and money. As he slowly assimilates with his surroundings, he befriends a man named Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) and his family members. There he begins to investigate who is behind the truck jackings.This is actually not a bad plot at all. The writing does have its weak points, which will be touched upon but let's start with the positive. I enjoyed how O'Conner has to come to grips with himself and who he's going to support. This shows that he's a human being and has a conscious. The same goes for Dominic Toretto, in a different way though. Toretto must come to grips with himself knowing he wasn't the person he once was. Both characters are from very different worlds yet they share a struggle that resembles each other. That struggle is being human and knowing who you are as a person. Sure it's not believable in every aspect but at least it lets the audience know that these characters do have a mind of their own.The weak part to the film is the final scene. All there is to say is that it is too abrupt. It completely detours from what the plot was centered on, along with leaving a few subplots open for interpretation. But was it needed - no. It would be nice to see some closure on more than one subplot. Surely if this franchise didn't earn a sequel then where would the conclusion to this story be? Hard to say. But if there's one thing that helps make up for that are the racing sequences to this movie. Even if you're not a racing fan, the action scenes should entertain. I mean, who doesn't want to (or enjoys already) driving over the speed limit for fun? Driving at high speeds gets the adrenaline pumping and makes every action much more intense. So if you don't enjoy that kind of thing, this movie isn't for you.The editing by Peter Honess who also did The Shadow (1994), L.A. Confidential (1997) and Highlander (1986) did a good job here as well. The shots are well connected and will keep the attention of the audience quite easily. The score produced by BT isn't anything to praise over though. Some action scenes didn't even contain music, which was odd because you'd think one would want to make that scene more intense by adding music. And although he doesn't create a theme for the franchise, his music does match the tone and attitude of the film. And for this kind of film, as long as it maintains that, that's all that matters. Because there is also contemporary music inserted in various scenes, BT's music transitions well into the contemporary music. It's good.It lacks logic in a few areas and has a loose ending but the car scenes and actors help them overcome that. Plus it has some unexpected character development that helps give the main characters a good amount of charm.",The Fast and the Furious
78,raulfaust,break her heart and I break your neck,7,27 December 2010,"Wow that feels good. ""The Fast and the Furious"" is a classic for those who like cars and gangs with a believable plot. All the actors really seemed to be what their characters were, specially Vin Diesel's. He playing the bad boy who puts friendship above everything is really respectable and it makes the spectator likes him and his friends. Also Walker's character could be considered as a hero and someone to be looked up to, since he cared for people as they were, putting people and their considerations above his job. It was an amazing scene when he saved Vince, because Vince showed no respect and consideration for him; Walker's char could easily leave and let him die, but he saved him without nothing in return: worse than that, allowing Toretto find out he was a cop, leading him to a trouble.Toretto's sister was really sexy and we feel happy when she gets together with O'Conner. The cars were awesome and I think that everyone who watches this movie is jealous and wants to drive those speedy cars. I just didn't like how the movie ended, it was kind of disappointing to me, I was expecting much more. Anyways, a must see for adrenaline lovers.",The Fast and the Furious

However, what puts TFaTF above mindless popcorn flicks is the fact that it has a brain which took me back by surprise. The film isn't only about street racing with hot lesbian girls and how much muscle your car has. There's actually a decent story in here! And this is the reason why I enjoyed the film.Another thing that stuck out to me was the rare use of CGI. The car sequences in the film are extremely well done, mostly due to using practical effects rather than CGI. The scenes felt more real and gritty compared to action scenes in other films. The climax car sequence had me on the edge of my seats!The performances by the cast members aren't half bad either. Vin Diesel and Paul Walker both pull off convincing roles. There's something about Diesel that is likable. I don't know what it is, though. I also liked Jordana Brewster and Michelle Rodriguez, who complete the clan.

82,TedStixonAKAMaximumMadness,"""The Fast and the Furious""- While the sequels have gotten better and better, the original feels a bit dated and ""safe."" Fun, but not as entertaining as future installments.",6,9 April 2017,"The interesting thing about the long-running ""Fast and Furious"" franchise is that series fans seem to fall into one of two camps. Those who feel that the series started off decent but has gotten progressively better with each passing sequel. Especially as they take themselves less seriously and simply aim to entertain their audience more and more with increasingly insane and physics-defying action. And those who far prefer the earlier and slightly tamer installments for their slightly more grounded realism. And they tend to lament the fact that the later sequels have gone in an increasingly unrealistic and over- the-top direction. And as a result, I feel I must warn certain audience members... I'm most certainly in the former of those two groupings. Yes, I am somewhat sorry to say that to me, the franchise as a whole really didn't start picking up steam until about the third or fourth chapter. While by no means terrible, the earlier films haven't aged particularly well at all, and feel quite... docile and bland. Even the subject of this review- the original 2001 release from director Rob Cohen. It's a standard story and spends so much time on a plot ripped straight from ""Point Break"" (only substituting cars instead of surf-boards), that it doesn't really entertain to the same wild extent that later installments eventually reached.The film follows detective Brian O'Connor (the late Paul Walker), as he goes undercover to infiltrate the underground world of illegal street racing in Los Angeles. O'Connor and his superiors suspect that the same men and women who hold these illegal events are also responsible for a string of crimes throughout the city. He eventually forms a sort-of friendship with Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel), one of the most famed of the underground racers. O'Connors conflicted feelings about whether or not to bust him are further complicated when he starts to fall for Dominic's younger sister Mia (Jordana Brewster), and eventually his investigation will lead to a complex and wild finale through the streets of LA.The highlights here are the wonderful and at-the-time relatively unknown cast and the high-octane action that crops up here and there. This is the film that really put Vin Diesel and the others on the map. Everyone gives it their all, and everyone comes across very likable and endlessly cool in the film. Especially Diesel and Walker, who both shot to stardom in the months following the film's release. I also really liked Michelle Rodriguez, who plays a supporting role as Letty, Domonic's girlfriend. She has that tough- yet-sexy appeal and works really well in the film. Brewster and fellow co-stars like Rick Yune and Chad Lindberg similarly do admirable jobs. On the whole, just a great, fun cast.Director Rob Cohen, fresh off of a string of 90's hits including ""Dragonheart"" and ""Dragon: The Bruce Lee Story"", does a phenomenal job handling the action and adventure with his kinetic camera-work and unique use of color and saturation. Say what you will about the mixed quality of the films he's made- the man can make a thrilling sequence. You really feel the speed in the races and each crash hits you right in the gut. This is amongst his best work as a visual storyteller, and he delivers the action full-throttle. When the film goes into full- blown carnage, it works marvelously.Unfortunately, the film falters quite a bit thanks to the aforementioned stock-screen writing and for being a bit too dated when viewed in comparison to the rest of the series. For all intents and purposes, there's not a lot going on ""under the hood"" here. Every twist and turn is telegraphed from a mile away, characters fall into broad and undeveloped clichés (usually given a single ""quirk"" to define them, which is lazy screen writing 101), and you'll know how it ends pretty much immediately. It takes away a lot of the experience. The fact that the film is also basically a photocopy of the superior ""Point Break"" is also distracting at times and can occasionally lead to a lot of unintended giggles. In addition, this film feels very much a product of its time. This has ""Extreme 2001 movie!"" written all over it. From the music to the editing to even the slang used in conversation... the film is dated to the point it even occasionally feels a bit cringe- worthy.Still, I don't think it's a bad movie. Just a troubled one. And I do think it is still most certainly worth seeking out, especially as a prerequisite to viewing the entire series. It sets up a lot of characters and context that are expanded on in later films, and there's a lot of fun to be had with the great performances and top-notch action. For my money... It's one of the weaker ""Fast & Furious"" films. But it's still a ""Fast & Furious"" film through-and-through. And I say give it a shot.I give it an about-average 6 out of 10.",The Fast and the Furious

Granted, the script ignores logic and reality at regular intervals, but the stakes are reasonably low and the stuntwork usually seems to exist in the real world. Ardent fans of shiny cars and street racing will probably enjoy it to some degree; for anyone else, it's no better than a way to kill time and appreciate the absence of Tyrese Gibson's witless-cisms.

Wow, that really was a short review. I told you.The Fast and the furious:***/****",The Fast and the Furious
89,Angelus2,"""Winning is winning""",10,24 January 2008,"Paul Walker is a undercover cop who has just infiltrated the most infamous street racing families; led by Vin Diesel; is mission is to find out who is robbing truck filled with electronics while in motion.The film is pure adrenaline rush; from great cars to great looking girls; this film brings a fun filled experience.Paul Walker's character Brian faces a dilemma as he falls in love with Dominic's (Vin) sister; he then investigates further only to find out that there is more then one street racing gang who is into electronics.The film is a true action classic, Paul Walker is okay as the undercover; but Vin steals the show, with his great lines and muscular arms.This film was the very first I think to introduce Nos; Nitrogen oxide. A lot of my friends had no idea what it was before this film came out; I felt a sense of pride, explaining it to them.Remember one last thing, Winning is winning.",The Fast and the Furious
90,RNMorton,Unique and very entertaining,9,10 April 2009,"It's pretty hard at this point in time to call anything ""groundbreaking"" in cinema, there's so much trash out there that is either eye candy, mindless or a rehash of some movie made much better years ago. I thought this one rises above other recent efforts largely because of the screen presence of Vin Diesel. Walker is undercover cop out to get behind recent truck-jackings in California. Diesel is an L.A. car hot-shot who is a prime suspect for the crimes. Walker insinuates himself into Vin's group and takes the lay of the land from there. Brewster is very attractive and effective as Diesel's sister and Walker's love interest. There's two things about this movie I think unique - Diesel's character (a strange mix of menace, indifference and personal loyalty), and the focus on the hopped-up econocar culture these guys operate in. I've seen bits and pieces of Diesel in other movies and he seems darker and less effective there, I think he worked well with the quietly upbeat Walker on this one. I'm hoping the new Fast & Furious can live up to this entry, well done!",The Fast and the Furious
91,baumer,There's something about Vin,8,25 June 2001,"Every summer a film comes around that takes everyone by surprise.  Last year it was Scary Movie and I'm sure in 1977 it was a film like Star Wars and then in 1981 it was Raiders of the Lost Ark.  Now I am not saying that The Fast and the Furious is in the same class as Raiders and Star Wars, just that it surprised everyone on the same level.  F&F is short on plot and dialogue and even some of the acting is lame, but what it is oozes is testosterone.  It pumps your blood, increases your adrenaline and attacks you with fast cars, sexy women and that one invariable that I think it has going for it... Vin Diesel.  There is just something about the guy, something that you really can't put your finger on, but he just has it. Maybe it is charisma, maybe it is charm, maybe it is just that he resembles some of the action heroes from the 80's with his chiseled triceps and his slabs of pecs.  Maybe it is all those things and maybe it is none of those things, all I know is that F&F is exactly what I had hoped it would be and nothing more.  This is the summer movie that I have been waiting for.  It's not that the films that have been out so far aren't that great because some of them are, it's just that this is the one that epitomises what summer as a teen ager is all about.  It is no wonder that exit polls for this film were around 65-70% under the age of 21.  And maybe that is why I enjoyed it so much.  I am pushing 30 but isn't it cool to lose yourself in a film that reminds you what it was like to be in highschool.  And isn't it cool to watch street racers break 140 miles an hour wile they shoot NOS through their vehicles?  Well isn't it?F&F doesn't contain any machinations similar to a film like Mission Impossible and it doesn't dazzle us with special effects of impending doom like Armageddon did, but it takes us into a world where people live life ""a quarter of a mile at a time.""  Vin Diesel plays Dominic Toretto, a massive, bald mechanic that owns a garage but street races on the side to make some extra cash.  Paul Walker ( The Skulls, Varsity Blues) plays Brian Spindler.  He is a cop that has infiltrated the street gang to find out who is highjacking trucks and stealing all their merchandise.  There are about four rival street gangs in L.A. and one of them is pulling this off.  He has to figure out which one. Of course along the way he seduced by the life, but that is not what we really care about.  All we want to see is lots of racing, a few crashes, some fights and some sex.  F&F doesn't disappoint.  If what you have seen in the trailers of the film excites and entices you, then you know exactly what you're in for.  This is not going to win any Oscars for anything but what it will do is entertain you.  It will expedite you for 90 minutes into a world where Honda's are souped up to look like Dragons and junkyard scraps are rebuilt from scratch to be better than they were before, better, stronger and faster.  If this film appealed to you in the commercial, it will appeal to you on the screen.And of course there is Vin Diesel.  He first made a name for himself in Saving Private Ryan where he played Capparrzo.  Then he jumped onto the scene with his excellent and grandiose turn as Riddick in Pitch Black.  I think this is the film that got him noticed because no one had even heard of him before this.  Then he did Boiler Room and he showed a different side to him.  But F&F is all muscle and sheer bravado.  I think Vin is going to do great things in the years to come.  He is not a nobody anymore.  This film will take care of that.  And face it, isn't it cool to see the genesis of a new action hero?  8 out of 10-  The ultimate summer rush!",The Fast and the Furious
92,PatrynXX,Rather dull ending for a fast running movie.,6,6 February 2002,"spoilers?I liked this movie.  But it has some serious flaws that may disgust some viewers.  The biggest notable item is the lack of an ending.  It's like they wrote the movie and they didn't know how to end it.  They kinda wrote themselves into a corner.  And it's never really known why the bad guys were bad guys, or why some triads were shot or killed.  Perhaps I should say the plot is very vague.What I had problems with is again this fear of the R rating.  They even explain this in some of the making of parts on the dvd.  Their reason for wanting a PG-13 is to get the kids to watch this movie.  It's really sad when the movie creators have to tone down a great movie because they want to get a certain rating.  They did that with Eyes Wide Shut so it wouldn't get the so called Dreaded NC-17 rating.  Why is it that American films are so scared of pi**ing people off?  Lolita was a great hit outside this country, but was practically banned in America.  So much for that first amendment.  I think this movie would have been so much better if it didn't worry about a rating.  I still like the movie, but some of the reasons behind their theories disturb me.6/10Quality: 4/10 Entertainment: 9/10 Replayable: 7/10",The Fast and the Furious
93,DunnDeeDaGreat,Clearly one of the best movies of the summer,10,23 June 2001,I just walked out of this movie and I'm still trying to catch my breath. Vin Disel (the next big action star) plays Dom a drag racer/mechaninc who is caught up in a stolen goods ring. Paul Walker(the next Rob Lowe) plays Brian an undercover cop sent to inflriate Dom's gang and try to stop them. The film also a subplot where Dom's gang has beef with an Asain crew lead by Rick Yune. Things complicate when Brian falls for Dom's sister played by the very sexy Jordanna Brewster. The film has a great supporing star in Michelle Rodgurez and cameo by Ja Rule. It also has some of the best car chase scenes since Ronin. Just go and enjoy this film.,The Fast and the Furious
94,jaredmobarak,I smell skanks  The Fast and the Furious,4,12 July 2009,"Ah, The Fast and the Furious, the film that launched the careers of Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, Jordana Brewster, and, for all intents and purposes, Michelle Rodriguez, (yes she starred in Girlfight previously). This foursome was so hot after this movie that some of them couldn't demean themselves by starring in the sequel. Poor them as, just a short eight years later, they all jumped at the opportunity to reunite with fast cars in the fourth installment. Oh how the mighty fall, especially when they weren't too mighty in the first place. I had my own preconceptions about this popcorn flick, virtually making me never want to take a chance on it at all. I thought the acting would be amateurish and campy, the story ludicrously absurd, and the cheese factor too high to overcome. Well, after finally sitting down to check it out I realized that I was clairvoyant. I wanted to at least have fun, and for a couple moments I did, but overall this Rob Cohen disaster is a throwaway that only shows how influential teenage boys are in the Hollywood spectrum. How else could we have three theatrically released sequels to what could be a made-for-TV movie at best? I see the similarities to Point Break, as my friend told me existed. It even goes to the point where if I closed my eyes I could have believed Paul Walker was Keanu Reeves. Where this film goes wrong, though, is by having Brewster's character involved, taking Walker's love away from Diesel. What works so well in the before-mentioned Kathryn Bigelow film is that there is more than just allusions to a man-crush between Reeves and Patrick Swayze. That dynamic doesn't quite exist here. Walker's Spilner/O'Connor may respect Diesel's Toretto, but he never idolizes the man. He sees a misguided soul that watched as his father burned to death on the racetrack, he sees a man who is nothing without his sister and racing team—his own makeshift family. Whether it is Toretto who is behind the truck-jacking or not, Walker is only staying close to find out, and get with Brewster's Mia of course.Speaking of the truck-jacking, is it just me or is that opening scene completely out-of-place? The film begins with four Hondas harassing a trucker, taking the driver out and, I guess, stealing the shipment. The cut is so abrupt that you never do find out what they do with the cargo, if anything. In fact, having the next scene in daylight with Walker, I thought maybe he was involved already, waiting for the criminals to meet up with him. Instead, he just floors his car, swears, and is all of a sudden at Mia's diner. It is so discombobulating that I seriously wanted to just turn it off. Only when Walker goes back to work at Harry's do we find out why he swore driving, and it's even longer until we find out where the trucks come into play. But this isn't trying to win awards for storytelling, it's just doing its best to entertain and titillate. Unfortunately, it did very little of either.The acting is pretty horrid across the board with Rodriguez probably the best of the four in a limited role. I didn't mind Diesel too much, the guy has charisma, but Walker's Keanu-speak was distracting because I don't remember him ever talking like that in other films. And when the cast is rounded off by stilted delivery from Rick Yune, Ja Rule, and Matt Schulze—the moment when Brewster asks Walker out and Schulze elbows the wall in anger made me laugh—you know you shouldn't be expecting very much else. Although, Chad Lindberg, as the whiz-kid engine technician, showed a lot of promise. I guess even the most asinine of films has a diamond in the rough somewhere.If anyone reading this has wanted to see it, don't let me stop you. I'm the first to admit that I have never seen the appeal of cars, either in their speed or in their look. The Fast and the Furious is all about the cars, so it had a pretty large strike against it from the beginning. I also don't particularly care for action films devoid of a strong story. That said, however, I had a fun time with the trucker's revenge sequence at the end watching Diesel attempt to save Schulze. It all kind of gets ruined with Vin's ""anger"" afterwards and his blind rage for payback against Yune's Johnny Tran, but at least one high-octane moment kept my interest. It's a good thing too because the ending is as abrupt as the start, answering all questions about where our two leads' relationship will go with wordless looks and nods. These two understand each other; they are kindred spirits who have opened their souls. One is a hardened criminal and the other an undercover cop, both with the streets to unite them. No loose ends are sealed and the fate of many is left unanswered. I'd love to see how Walker explains who was stealing the electronic equipment to his superiors. The filmmakers probably never thought a sequel would be imagined and felt pretending it didn't matter would be enough.",The Fast and the Furious
95,mattymatt4ever,The Dull and the Boring,3,1 February 2002,"Why did this become a box office smash?  It has action, it has fast cars and it has no intellectual value whatsoever.  Not to mention, it has Paul Walker and Vin Diesel--who will appeal to the female audience.  OK, so it has the potential to be a slam-bang, entertaining action flick...but I wasn't entertained.  Many will be blown away by the stunts.  But I found them to be far from spectacular.  The movie does keep a fast-pace--almost in the style of an MTV music video--but it can't seem to escape from dullness.  Director Rob Cohen, who has actually directed some good movies in the past, tries too hard to be flashy.  The soundtrack, though full of great songs, is out of whack.  The songs seemed to have been chosen at random.  And of course Cohen felt this is going to appeal to a predominantly young audience, so he jumped at any attempt to insert a song from Ja Rule or any other popular rap artist into each scene, whether it's appropriate or not.As for our two leads, Vin Diesel and Paul Walker--ever consider acting lessons?  The two of them are stiff as a board.  In one scene, Diesel is telling a story about his father's death and he doesn't let out the slightest hint of emotion.  Walker's got the looks, Diesel's got the bod.  I guess that's all they need to qualify!  Standards are getting lower and lower by the minute, in the world of cinema.  Michelle Rodriguez unfortunately has a very small role.  Too bad, because she seems like she has real potential.  I haven't even seen her debut role--which everyone was raving about--in ""Girlfight,"" but she has great ability and a strong presence, and I'm sure she can rise to the top if given the right outlet. BTW, she's also from Jersey City.  Representin'!!!!  The dialogue is downright awful.  The characters are flat.  The plot is far from compelling and sometimes predictable, with tired action cliches planted here and there.  How many movies are we gonna see where the hero ends up falling in love with the villain's sister?And I think the movie would've worked better if it took itself less seriously.  ""Gone in 60 Seconds"" was no gem either, but it was campy and it was meant to be campy.  And it was done with a tongue-in-cheek approach, with some very funny moments of comic relief.  ""The Fast and the Furious"" actually tries to be A-class entertainment, but it doesn't even deserve to be in the D-class.  There are some nice shots of scantily clad babes, and that's the only reason why I'm not giving this movie a rating of 1.  If you're an automobile fanatic or is this is simply your kind of entertainment, have fun.  If not...be prepared for the Dull and the Boring.  My score:  3 (out of 10)",The Fast and the Furious
96,educallejero,"It was good for a while, but it ended up mediocre.",5,24 March 2019,"I'm watching the whole series (I only saw 1 and 2), so this is the first one. I liked it for what it was when I was 15 or something, but even then I knew it wasn't good.Besides the awful acting and mediocre at best dialogue, I have to say It was good (just that, good) for a while, which was surprising. All the set-up was fun, even if dumb of course, and the 2nd act was good, creating tension for Paul Walker's character.And then... they dropped the ball. They made a scene that could've cut a lot of boring minutes of this movie, and justify the ending at the same time.And yet, they keep going, wasting all the tension just to have a stupid last motivation for the characters to be where the writers wanted them to be. Again, they didn't need the dumb Hollywood 3rd act because by the end of the second they had the characters in good position to finish the movie. But they wanted more chases, and races, and cars blowing up, and they made a bit of a boring flatter ending.It's ""ok fun"", 5 points.",The Fast and the Furious
97,phubbs,The Fast and the Furious,5,22 November 2014,"One of the most overrated ridiculous franchises ever? well you get what you pay for right, you see the trailer, you see fast cars and slutty girls, you know what you're gonna get. Apart from the visuals, you see who directs this and you know not to expect a great deal, Rob Cohen...a low rent Michael Bay who makes trashy flashy CGI filled flicks. But who knew how far this would go, how long this dumb adventure would last and why is it so popular?I imagine it appeals to the young generation, fast cars, hot chicks and lots of huge stunts, I guess you could say its 'The Dukes of Hazzard' for the modern era. Unfortunately originality is not on the menu, the plot...a gang of fast car, street racing adrenaline junkies/petrol heads are hijacking trucks utilising their driving skills. Undercover cop infiltrates this street racing world posing as a fellow fast car petrol head to try and find out who is behind the hijackings.Wait a moment...a gang of surfer adrenaline junkies are robbing banks (although not utilising their surfing skills). An undercover cop infiltrates their surfer world posing as a fellow wannabe surfer to try and find out who is behind the robberies. Yep, this film is 'Point Break' but with cars instead of surf boards.None of it really makes any sense though, Toretto seems to own garages and a property yet never has any customers or does any work, yet he's clearly loaded. He owns an array of cars that are all worth a fortune, all heavily modded and would cost loads to maintain and insure yet he treats them as if they were meaningless and crashes them left right n centre. Money seems to be no object to the characters in this film, oh I just smashed up my Mitsubishi with about 20K worth of modifications to it, oh well I'll just turn up in the next scene with another. Oh my Dodge Charger means everything to me cos me and my dad built it and put tonnes of money n love into it...meh I'll just race it against a train, no worries.Its also amusing how all the street racers drive around in car posses, taking up the entire road, yeah like that wouldn't attract the police. Oh and the police clearly have trouble catching these guys and their cars, OK, well why not drive around the suburbs and look for the houses with top line modded Jap cars parked outside. Yes they park their illegal fast cars in the street outside their abodes...oh dear.Now as I said you can't expect much from this film, its clearly style over substance, half the film is merely imagery of car porn and scantily clad ladies hanging around next to them. The acting is hilariously bad from everybody, I've haven't seen so much posing, swaggering, hardman attitudes and general showing off for a long time, (usually reserved for gangsta hoodie type flicks). Hordes of wannabes crowd around the main actors in the street race scenes all looking desperate to get on camera for five seconds...and its obvious. All the young super slim females look stunningly sexy (err kids film?) yet have no clue what on earth is going on, oh and then we have a sweaty looking Michelle Rodriguez...yikes!Despite all the high fives and god awful bling the main crux of the film, the cars, is pretty sweet. If you are into cars such as myself then its fun purely for that, if you like Japanese super saloons then even more so. Take note kids this is about fast cars, no BMW's, Mercs or Audi's required. This is probably the only area of the film which is remotely interesting, there is a really good range of modified Jap cars here and not just top line models either, some nice retro gear. Of course this is a Cohen film so there has to be a bit of CGI in there somewhere, blasting through the engine as it ignites, not a bad idea but it looks hokey.The sequences where they hijack these big rigs are stupid, they don't make much sense, why not just stop the thing? The finale is even dumber, again just stop the truck! or shoot out its tyres maybe geez! Everything is naturally predictable and cheesy, plenty of tight vests, muscles and tattoo's. Vin Diesel shouts a lot, Rodriguez scowls a lot and Walker does his best Keanu Reeves impression. All this and hardly any guns in sight! that's because its a watered down action thriller folks.The big crash stunt at the very end involving Vin Diesel and his souped up Dodge Charger is admittedly very cool, best little sequence in the film really...I had to watch all this just for that?! Well...the scene where they smoke the Ferrari had me smiling, Italian rubbish!5/10",The Fast and the Furious
98,Bob-45,Rob Cohen reinvents the Hod Rod Movie,6,7 January 2002,"Like costars Vin Diesel and Michelle Rodriguez, `The Fast and the Furious' is sleek, sexy, all attitude and dubious morality.  Expect no surprises from the thin script, just hot metal, great tunes, flash and pizzaz.  Paul Walker is the GQ-Pretty Anglo love interest.  Jordan Brewster plays Diesel's baby sister.  Both are pros, but they pale against the impact of Diesel and Rodriguez.  Also of special note are Giovanni Ribisi-clone Chad Lindbert as Jesse and Matt Schulze as Vince, Diesel's childhood buddy and Walker's rival for Brewster.

99,jon.h.ochiai,Speed Rush,8,25 June 2001,"Rob Cohen's ""Fast and Furious"" is just that: an adrenaline and speed rush, very derivative, not original, though effective overall. Cohen accomplishes this with the given material, by using intensity, pacing, hard driving music, and casting high power, young actors in the movie, in particular Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, and Rick Yune. F&F is the kind of movie that may not be memorable for it's dramatic content and narrative style, rather as a breakthrough vehicle for its stars. On that basis, the movie has merit. Director Cohen definitely performs some of the most amazing car sequences on screen. The driving stunts rule.Brian (Walker) is an undercover cop investigating a ring of high speed car thieves. While undercover Brian befriends Dom Toretto (Diesel), a powerful street racer with a dark past, who has a sense of honor and loyalty. Dom's rival is a cold blooded leader of an Asian gang, Johnny Tran (Yune). All movie leads shine. Vin Diesel has a commanding physical screen presence. He powers Dom's character with an edge and sense of danger. Diesel will be a huge action star-- he's got the physique and is a good actor. Walker has the leading man good-looks, and attitude. He is well matched as Diesel's foil. He does well with the trite undercover cop storyline of falling in love with the suspect's (Dom's) sister. Rick Yune gives Johnny Tran a dangerous air-- a man of few words and an icy killer. It's always encouraging when a movie has both strong and charismatic heroes and villains. It is all about being cool and looking good-- and ""Fast and Furious"" does this with style and without significance. That is a good thing...",The Fast and the Furious
100,stamper,"Standard, but good standard",7,31 March 2002,"This film is really nothing mind blowing, when you consider the story, acting and stuff like that, but it is well made none the less. This could have been a TV film, hadn't it been for, well nothing really. This could have been an expensive TV film. It is just a crime story like there are hundreds out there, but the well filmed racing scenes, that keep you on the edge of your seat are well done and so is the entire film, which makes this standard car flick rise out of mediocrity.

101,ivo-cobra8,A solid entertainment weel done action heist movie,10,17 October 2015,"The Fast and the Furious (2001) It is solid decent action film of the film franchise. I love this film it is my third favorite film in the series. I wasn't watching this film for the cars or street races this film is about robbery, as a string of high-speed electronics truck robberies rocks the area. The Team stole $1.2 million worth of major electronics and the cops doesn't have any leads who has done it. There is only one team that could be responsible, Dominic Torreto (Vin Diesel) and his gang of street racers. During the night Torreto and his crew of street racers are driving cars in Los Angeles. Brian O'Conner (Paul walker) a undercover LAPD officer under the alias ""Brian Earl Spilner"", is he assigned to find out who is stealing the merchandise. This is my favorite film, it is an decent Action film about heist $1.2 million and not about the cars. Why I love this film? Because It is clever, intelligent, Entertained, fast paced and not boring film. The girls are beautiful in this team. The Action sequences are real and perfectly done. I love that late Paul Walker plays Brian O'Conner and undercover L.A. Police Officer who try's to do the right thing. I am Paul Walker fan and Brian O'Conner is my favorite character of the whole franchise and series. I am saying The Fast and the Furious is better than 2,3 and even 7 so the film is pretty good.Paul Walker, Vin Diesel, Michelle Rodriguez and Jordana Brewster did a terrific job playing their characters.With these players set in motion, it's up to the script to deliver the real substance of the movie. (One often sees great performances in mediocre films..here the story transcends the performances -- an impressive feat.) The script delivers. These themes are reinforced by the fine performances by Paul Walker and, particularly, Vin Diesel. Diesel's Toretto is a tough, no-nonsense, street-smart and highly-skilled racer on the outside, but as O'Conner and the audience come to know him, it is revealed that he is a human being with feelings, a troubled and hard past, and doing his best to get along, even if it means skirting or breaking the law. He's the head of a household, and the patriarch of sorts of a gang that is more family than it is a collection of members. Diesel brings hard-nosed and gritty energy to the role, but compliments that with a softer, more accessible side that makes him an odd sort of antihero, a man clearly in the wrong but not maliciously or spitefully so. Walker, too, is excellent as the undercover officer that finds the world of underground racing not-so-seedy as it seems. On the turbo-charged streets of Los Angeles, every night is a championship race. With intense full-throttle action, awesome high-speed stunts, and full-on pedal to the metal intensity, this fast and furious assault puts you in the driver's seat and dares you to exceed all limits.Los Angeles police officer Brian O'Connor must decide where his loyalties really lie when he becomes enamored with the street racing world he has been sent undercover to destroy.It don't matter if you win by an inch or a mile. Winning's winning. The Fast and the Furious is a gritty and gratifying cheap thrill, Rob Cohen's high-octane hot-car is a true rarity these days, a really good exploitation, the sort of thing that would rule at drive-ins if they still existed. The Fast and the Furious is a good Action movie. It offers a conventional plot but populates the story with well-developed primary characters that draw the audience in and make them care about their stories. In the movie, the line between good and bad becomes blurred to the point that, by the end, it matters not which side of the law the characters call home.I love this film to death! It is my 3d favorite film in the series franchise. The Fast and the Furious kicks ass! Even for PG-13 film they kick ass! Brian O'Conner kicks ass!!!",The Fast and the Furious
102,eminkl,The testosterone reaches critical mass quite early in this ridiculously self-indulgent nitrous oxide orgasm.,2,17 April 2020,"Paul Walker gets his breakout role as an undercover cop, one with very little interest in actually doing any police work, who falls in with a crew of enterprising gear heads on the midnight street racing circuit. Vin Diesel, the headline costar, takes on his usual character: a growling, flexing, ultra-chill bro with shady connections but an open heart. Neither are particularly likable or interesting. The whole thing is shallower than a toilet bowl, ticking so many ""cool point"" boxes that it mimics a rich, forgettable, three-minute music video. We've got fast cars, gorgeous sex objects, adrenaline-rich action scenes, loud radio hits (juuust a bit dated) and a posh location or two. Not much in the way of meaningful character arcs or deeper substance. It's a true ""what you see is what you get"" experience. Big and dumb and gruff and insecure, with a plot that varies from meaningless to pointless and a versatile cast with nothing to do beyond gripping the steering wheel (or each other) and looking sexy.

105,swilliky,A decent action movie that sparks a huge series,5,13 April 2017,"The movie that started it all follows a pretty generic plot and doesn't have the best action or acting, but is a passable film to build a franchise off of. Brian O'Connor (Paul Walker) is an undercover cop trying to infiltrate a gang of street racers led by Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel). Brian flirts with Mia (Jordana Brewster), Dom's sister, and clashes with the gang of street racers, especially Vince (Matt Schulze). The rest of Dom's gang including Letty (Michelle Rodriguez), Jesse (Chad Lindberg), and Leon (Johnny Strong) are more accepting of Brian's presence in the group. Brian loses a race to Dom but helps him elude the police to gain his trust. Owing him a car, the two work to build a new car as Brian investigate a string of truck robberies. He suspects that the criminals are led by a rival racer Johnny Tran (Rick Yune). Sgt. Tanner (Ted Levine) and Agent Bilkins (Thom Barry) push Brian to look at Toretto as his bond with the team grows. They build a fast car that they plan to use in the upcoming street racing competition know as Race Wars. Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com",The Fast and the Furious
106,AngelHonesty,Perfect Balance,8,31 December 2020,"Not a film that makes a big mark, but I do have to admit they have a good balance in it. There was a good mix of action, girls, romance, car racing mixed in with a bit of a plot. The movie isn't deep or Oscar winning. With so few movies out there that touch on street racing I was impressed with this film. I loved all the cool hot rod cars and the racing. It's fun to see Vin Diseal taking on the role as a Gang Leader, with his expert racing. Fast and the Furious is a fun film, not a serious one, but fun.",The Fast and the Furious

This film had nothing going for it whatsoever (unless, of course, you are really into one of those subjects that I just mentioned). The film is all about fast cars and a little bit of crime with 'bad guys/bad girls' image. That sums up the entire film, which leaves little to the imagination and little anything to appreciate.I certainly will not be recommending this film to anyone. Hey, if you like nothing but watching cars race on screen and a little bit of 'bad guy/bad girl' gang life, then I hope you enjoy this. I personally think it is one of the worst movies that I've had the displeasure of seeing.",The Fast and the Furious
108,deatman9,good movie ruined by terrible actors.,6,21 October 2012,I give this movie a six because it really is a pretty good movie. The story line is new and interesting and it is very entertaining in my opinion the actors just ruin it though. Paul Walker and Vin desiel can not act at all so everything seems so fake and unbelievable just because of them.This movie is about an undercover cop who goes undercover to infiltrate an underground street racing ring. Though as his friendships with these people grow closer and closer he slips from being a cop to being a criminal.This movie was still pretty good even despite the robot like acting of walker and deseil. Overall I still think its worth a watch.,The Fast and the Furious

Yes those aforementioned elements are addressed much to the appreciation of the film's target audience I'm sure but Vin Disel and especially Paul Walker's charisma made their characters very interesting and even sympathetic. I actually cared about their fates. The rest of the supporting cast also complemented the leads nicely, especially Rick Yune (Die Another Day). I'm not really that fascinated by cars (I think they are noisy and pollutive) but this introduction to the street racing sub-culture was informative. The stunts were also nicely done with minimal special effects. Solid escapism, 7/10.",The Fast and the Furious

That's not enough for a movie I'd go see, however, so i was hesitant to watch ""The Fast and the Furious."" I did get the DVD, though, and am glad I did. Maybe my low expectations helped me to enjoy it-- I admit that I was pleasantly surprised. There are two heros-- the blond guy, and Vin Deisel. The blond guy was an annoying weasel and wuss for the first three fourths of the flick, and then I began to like him. The other hero is played by Deisel, an amazing actor. I'd seen him in ""Saving private Ryan,"" but nothing else. This dood' screen presence is magnetic. He's got charisma as well as depth. My guess is we'll see Deisel become a solid and major star--- that is, if he chooses his roles and career moves rightly.",The Fast and the Furious

115,qormi,"Pure Fantasy, but it Works",8,19 December 2010,"This is a good movie to watch more than once. The first time I saw it, I didn't know what to expect and it seemed very fast-paced and confusing. The movie is rather bizarre, and I dismissed it as being dumb. The second time I saw it, I began to appreciate it. The cinematography, editing, and clipped acting worked together with the hip soundtrack. The plot seemed implausible, but it was entertaining. Definitely a cut above any ""B"" flick, this film was first rate. Paul Walker and Vin Diesel were great in their respective roles. When Diesel went off and kicked someone's butt, he was the epitome of a genuine bad dude. Walker was the ultimate in cool, even though he acted like a teenager, but that's what undercover cops do. So, I have to recommend ""Fast and Furious"" - tuner car heaven. And the climactic duel between tuner cars and 18-wheeler was one of the better action sequences ever filmed. Even though climbing onto the hood of a truck going 80 mph is completely ludicrous. How would he get into the cab without being hit with a stick? Doesn't the driver have a cell phone to call 911??",The Fast and the Furious
116,anselmdaniel,Simple beginnings,6,26 September 2020,"This review contains spoilers.The Fast and The Furious is an action movie starring Paul Walker, Vin Diesel, and Michelle Rodriguez. The Fast and the Furious is an action movie that uses race cars as its main action set piece. The story follows Brian O'Conner, an undercover cop played by Paul Walker, that tracks a group of hijackers that utilize race cars.The story is really an excuse to have high octane car chases and races. From the beginning, the story opens with a car chase with the race cars in view. This scene shows the series prioritizes these scenes. I do not have a problem with this as the series is great in its ability to have some weight to its well-done action scenes. The racing scenes have not aged well with many gratuitous scenes, but this is acceptable as it is a view of both the times and culture of street racers.There are some plot holes that the audience should ignore because of the movie's focus. The main one is Brian O'Conner's willingness to allow Dominic Toretto to go free. It was strange to see as Brian never felt like a cop and should have never been part of the force. It felt more fitting that Brian be a racer attempting to work his way up rather than as an undercover cop. There would have been more street races with this route.Vin Diesel does a good job as Dominic Toretto and the movie absolutely needed his character. I did like the route the movie took with trying to establish him as a father figure to his crew. This does feel cheesy at times but it is entertaining.The action scenes are the complete focus here. You should only be watching this movie for the action. This is what made the movie a summer blockbuster hit. With the actors in their places, this movie excels at these scenes.The Fast and the Furious is not a complete movie. The movie tilts to the action side too much. This is at least enjoyable and it should be the reason to watch this movie.Grade: B",The Fast and the Furious
117,FlickJunkie-2,"Weak story, but heart stopping action",7,4 January 2002,"This film examines the street racing subculture and provides ample thrills for the 25 and under set.  Based on the box office numbers this film threw up, every teenager in the U.S. must have seen it at least twice, since it doesn't have much appeal outside that demographic.The screenplay pretends to be a detective story about an undercover cop Brian O'Connor (Paul Walker) who infiltrates the street racing scene to try to find a group thieves that has been hijacking tractor trailers and stealing the cargo.  Make no mistake about it.  This is not a detective story.  This is a racing story replete with fast, NOS guzzling street machines, horsed up to burn rubber and detailed to attract babes.  Fasten your seatbelt for a screaming ride to testosterone city.The script panders shamelessly to post pubescent boys with hormone overload. Universal wisely kept it PG-13 to maximize the film's target audience. There is plenty of strutting, getting in people's faces, muscle flexing and a street fight about every fifteen minutes.  Everyone demands respect and if they don't get it there is either a brawl or a race.  Director Rob Cohen, who cut his directorial teeth on `Miami Vice', has an implicit understanding of what makes male movies work and he pulls out all the stops in this film.
Unfortunately, Cohen gets so immersed in the street culture that he recklessly reinforces antisocial conduct as normative.  The film sends a consistent message that honor and loyalty to one's friends are more important than the obeying the law.  The police are portrayed as jerks and fools.  The only way to handle injustice is to take matters into your own hands.  You stick up for your friends even if they are criminals and you are a cop.  If another cop disrespects one of your undercover friends, you slug him.  While this might be an accurate reflection of the culture, I feel compelled to interject that the movie industry has a social responsibility to teach our youth good lessons rather than bolster countercultural behavior in the name of realism.Once you get past the script, the film gets extraordinarily high technical marks for the action photography and stunts.  The cars are first rate. Most of the ones seen at the race wars were owned by actual street racers who brought their cars from everywhere to be in the film.  The film has so much adrenaline pumping action that by the time it is finished you need oxygen and a yoga session to settle yourself down.  I can't ever remember a film that had so many cars going airborne.  There is more molten, smoking rubber in this film than in a Perelli manufacturing plant.  The final stunt where the cars are racing to beat the train across the railroad crossing is an awesome, heart-stopping thrill ride.  It is easy to see why kids flocked to this film.The most notable member of the cast is Paul Walker (The Skulls, Pleasantville) who steps up to the lead for the first time.  In the featurette included with the DVD, Rob Cohen declares Walker a modern day Steve McQueen.  I'm afraid not.  McQueen, who saw his heyday in the 1950's and 60's, was a swaggering, audacious male lead brimming with machismo and frequently compared to Paul Newman (who was the star in `Somebody Up There Likes Me', the first film in which McQueen appeared).  Walker is a pussycat by comparison.  If Walker were to be compared to anyone of that generation it would be Troy Donohue, the good looking heart throb of the 1960's. Donohue wasn't extremely dynamic, but the camera loved him, and so did the teenage girls.  Walker fits comfortably into that description.If there is one standout in the film it is Vin Diesel as Dominic.  Diesel carries every scene in which he appears with a pure and imposing power that is present whether he is scrapping or just standing there.  He is mostly tough, but in the scene where he tells Brian about his father, he shows that he can conjure up a vulnerable side.  He presents his character in a way that is both charismatic and complex, part villain and part hero.  No one else in this cast is anywhere near Diesel's league as an actor.Jordana Brewster shows some promise as Dominic's sister and Brian's love interest.  Rick Yune, whose performance I enjoyed in `Snow Falling on Cedars', is menacing and believable as the leader of the Asian gang.This film has a limited audience, but is well done for its target market. I rated it a 7/10 on the strength of the action and stunts.  The story is about a 2/10, but the racing and chase scenes are as good as it gets.",The Fast and the Furious
118,Maniac-9,The beginning of it all,8,18 January 2013,"This is the movie that created a brand new mega movie franchise.

But later this year when Fast and the Furious 6 comes out it'll be the sixth movie in the series which shows the level of box office appeal the series has to be able to pump out an average of 1 movie every two years is quite impressive. The only other series doing that kind of productivity with different directors on basically a once every 2 year rate is the James Bond series.Vin Diesel who outside of his other series Riddick movies generally puts out mediocre to bad performances was basically made to play the role of Dominic Torretto. Same goes for Paul Walker, normally when I see he's going to be in a movie I don't bother watching it.

122,policy134,I am getting old,3,4 July 2015,"Awful, awful. I avoided seeing any of the Furious movies for over a decade and maybe it was because of the teaser trailer. Maybe it was because it didn't show anything about what the movie was about or maybe it was because the movie itself wasn't aimed at me as an audience. I was almost thirty at the time, but I have enjoyed other movies that were not aimed at my age group like the first Spiderman movie which was released around the same time.What I dislike about the first movie is the stupid dialogue. Yeah, yeah. I know it has something to say about loyalty and whatever but mostly sounds like it was written by a 13-year old. Spiderman was goofy in places but there is a weird kind of tone throughout this, especially in the scenes between Vin Diesel and Paul Walker.There is one particular scene that I didn't get for the life of me. Diesel's thuggish best friend accuses Walker of being a cop and the two of them is ready to kill Walker, but the scene ends without a payoff what so ever. It just cuts to the next scene. What the f...! The friend does inspire one of the funniest scenes in the whole thing. The friend is about to cause trouble because he is incensed that Walker has been accepted so easily by Torreto (Diesel's name in the flick). Diesel loses his temper and says something like: ""I didn't know you either and accepted you"". The friend then replies: ""We were 3, you idiot"". Priceless, even though it's not totally verbatim. I honestly can't remember if I reversed the dialogue, but it is still funny as hell.One more scene I have to mention which is unintentionally hilarious. Walker blows his pistons in the first race. Diesel says something like: ""Oh, we better get that repaired"". The car is steaming and 2 seconds later Walker's car is fine to drive. What did they do? Just throw the pistons in the hood and they magically attached and worked perfectly. Granted, I am not a mechanic but I know a car that has lost its pistons need more work than that. Then there is a guy who says: Cops are coming! Walker and Diesel flees in separate cars and for a very flimsy reason, Diesel decides to park in a garage and just slowly stroll down the street (check out the directors commentary).l The cops spot him and Walker picks him up (of course in the magically reconstructed car).I know I am not supposed to nitpick at plot points like this but they are so obvious here. The races are few and far between which is another problem and they are hard to follow. One thing you could see is the lever that activates the nitrous oxide conveniently labeled ""NOS"". Again, hilarious.There are a lot of other problems with the movie but let's just say I was thoroughly underwhelmed. I knew I was not supposed to see a piece of high art but come on; some b-movies make ten times more sense than this. I was also shocked to find out that Roger Ebert actually liked this and gave it three stars. He attacked films that had much better dialogue and plot developments than this. Maybe his illness was getting to him at that point, but I don't think so.I know my commentary is a little long and perhaps a bit unfair because there are some good elements in the show. A sensational car chase at the end and the best part, Paul Walker, as I am saddened by his death. He could have done so much more than these picture and if you saw one of his first roles in Pleasantville you saw real potential. He looked a lot like a young Paul Newman and could have followed his path which makes his death even sadder. I guess the money eased his pain, though.Note: Do yourself a favor and listen to the director's commentary. Not only is it hilarious but makes you understand the film a whole lot better. I changed my opinion from this being a terrible movie to a terrible movie with some good elements, if that has any relevance to anyone at all.",The Fast and the Furious
123,dilipbts,The fast and the furious,7,10 June 2020,"A mindlessly entertaining film, The Fast and the Furious features fun action, sexy cars and women as well as having some cool characters.

124,ruby_fff,"Stay 'til the very end, after the credits roll, for the conclusive ending",7,21 July 2001,"I wouldn't call this 'trashy' goods. It's a perfectly good Hollywood script. Besides the car 'dueling' action sequences, it includes energy of the younger set (20 something's), the eagerness to experience risks, and the plight to feel the spirit of freedom - even if it's a matter of moments. Death is not an ominous worry to them. They live for the moment.
Paul Walker is in the lead role of Brian, the undercover LA cop. He has worked with director Rob Cohen before in ""The Skulls"" 2000. Rob Cohen directed the ""Dragon: The Bruce Lee Story"" 1993 with Jason Scott Lee and Lauren Holly. Also ""Dragonheart"" 1993, a fable of a legend with Sean Connery doing voice of the Dragon which Dennis Quaid gallantly duels with. Cohen's movies may be Hollywood, yet they tend to have a backbone ethical/living outlook that prompts the integrity of the central character(s).
Vin Diesel is Dominic, the rebellious one here - can past as James Dean, the leader whom the gang looks up to. He stood out in ""Boiler Room"" 2000, opposite Giovanni Ribisi, and was the only good thing in ""Pitch Black"" 2000, the sci-fi flick which he was the lead opposite Radha Mitchell (from ""High Art"" 1998 opposite Ally Sheedy.)Jordana Brewster was last seen as the furiously grieving sister of Cameron Diaz in ""The Invisible Circus"" playing opposite Christopher Eccleston (who's in ""Gone in 60 Seconds,"" another fast cars and chase flick). Brewster is Dominic's feisty sister Mia, furiously sulky here besides having a chance to be fast (driving, matching up to the testosterone bunch.) Michelle Rodriguez is Dominic's woman, full of anger within, charged with a devil may care defiance. The role of Johnny by Rick Yune has a flavor of Giovanni Ribisi's energy as in ""Gone in 60 Seconds."" But Cohen's ""The Fast and the Furious"" is comparably more substantial and colorful in storyline and character development, even comes with a 'dream' quote for the fast and the furious: ""I live my life quarter of a mile per second at a timenothing else mattersin those 10 seconds, I'm free."" And the backbone that held together the friendship between Walker and Diesel's characters is soundly strong.
Be sure to stay on to the very end of the movie - after all the credits roll, Vin Diesel and Paul Walker you'll see, and you get to hear Dominic's quote once again (besides receiving a satisfying closure to the story.)",The Fast and the Furious

128,CinematicInceptions,Cars and crime. Everybody needs a hobby...,6,17 December 2016,"If I had seen this before any of the sequels had come out, I would never have thought that this summer action crash-test movie would have gotten enough attention and revenue to spark a series that is working on its eighth movie fifteen years later. It was not all that impressive. The script is slightly less than mediocre in a craft sense, and it isn't helped by the mindless action sequences and sub-par acting. The ending was good, but aside from that the story was pretty flat. However, I can see how it might have had some resonance with people who go crazy for cars as well as the Hispanic crowds. If nothing else can be said of this franchise, it is perhaps the only one that combines big budgets with lower class people. Most action movies involve middle class government workers or high class assassins. But with the FAF movies, working class characters get big action treatment, which is nice in its own way.Though there is some substance to the story with Brian having his mission to arrest Dom, much of the movie exists for the purpose of establishing the world of drag racing. One in which people love cars and love the thrill of racing them. This is what they live for, and while it may not be the greatest hobby to have from a safety and legal standpoint, it seems to have some real emotional value to Dom. It may be a community run by criminals, but it still has its own pride, and this same theme is carried into many of the sequels.Even though much of the plot is driven by action sequences and car races, there remains the human conflict beneath it. It isn't a great emotional story line, but there are some decent character conflicts within it. The progression of Brian's relationship with Mia is not that great, but it is good in how it impacts Brian and Dom's relationship. There are a number of minor characters who help give us a sense of the world of car racing. Letty falls into this category, having some prominence, but no real arc of her own. The only larger function she serves is being part of the original ""family"" that becomes more established as the series goes on.If you have seen the later movies (fast five and on), but have not seen the original, just know that you're in for a different kind of movie. This first installment, though it does not have action of the same grand scale as the later movies, is much grittier and more violent in its own way. I sensed that it wanted to be an R-rated movie, but they held back enough for it to retain a PG-13 rating. If you feel like you have to see the movies in order, I can tell you firsthand that the more recent installments still make plenty of sense on their own. It may be better to see them in order, but it's not necessary. Overall Rating: 7.3/10",The Fast and the Furious
129,jhaggardjr,An unexpected surprise,8,29 July 2001,"""The Fast and the Furious"" is a movie that surprised me big time because I didn't think I would like it. It didn't look all that great when I saw the previews of it, and I was dreading that I would have a miserable time watching it when some friends talked me into seeing the film with them. By the end of it, I was incredibly surprised at how much I liked this movie. It's not one of the best movies ever made, but it kept me interested from start to finish. ""The Fast and the Furious"" is about drag racing in L.A., and focuses on a young undercover cop who falls into a group of professional drag racers who just might be the same ones who've been participating in a series of truck hijackings. The young cop tries to get to the bottom of this by becoming close friends with the leader of this group. Here for once is a movie that features car races and chases with the use of real cars, not special effects. It's at its best when the action takes place behind the wheel, and these scenes keep you on the edge. Plus, it has a story that works because it's interesting. Paul Walker (as the cop) and Vin Diesel (as the group leader) are given good material to work with, and both actors play their characters well. You get to know these two guys, and you can't help but wonder what's going to happen to them in the end. That makes ""The Fast and the Furious"" an even better film. Good acting, good story, and good action make this film a surprise winner.*** (out of four)",The Fast and the Furious
130,bsinc,An entertaining no-brainer,6,17 March 2003,"""Fast And The Furious"" is nothing revolutionary, even the car scenes aren't as good as I'd hoped for, but you just have to like the world these characters are living in. Fast cars equals having gorgeous women at every corner (loved the sexy Michelle Rodriguez) and dodging cops all day long.The acting's nice, the cars look good(but a far cry from great since, with the great exception of Diesel's 900 horse power monster, they all look too much alike), and the women doubly so, but the plot in this movie is just the glue that binds together. Some compare this movie to ""Point Break"". Please, the only thing they have in common is that the guy is an undercover cop that lets the ""bad guy"" go free. A good popcorn movie, nothing more.  6/10",The Fast and the Furious
131,willcundallreview,A racing movie with slight depth,6,6 June 2015,"Rating-6/10The Fast and Furious is a racing movie, with crime, that also serves thrills and spills all over the workshop. This is the kind of movie we so often dislike but for me, this isn't dislikeable and is actually an OK piece of film, a kind of ""give it a go"" kind of movie. The whole show is pretty well made and no one can deny the stunts involved aren't fantastically done, and the plot is actually not half bad at all.Brian O'Conner(Paul Walker) is a cop racing in street races, trying to infiltrate racing gangs and the like, and to be fair Walker does it kind of nicely. I did feel out of the main cast that Walker feels the most uncomfortable, but he still manages to lead the movie out well enough. Vin Diesel as the gang leader Dominic is OK too, he actually outshines everybody here and his acting skill really comes through for me here, proves what he has in the locker.Rob Cohen directs this a bit OK, not great but he steadies it, the film could have been more on point at times but nevertheless he still catches the right feeling the script gives off. And on that note the film Is written much the same, missed opportunities here and there and massive cheesy lines can harm it, but I think by the end of the story, your hooked on the adrenaline junkie action, rather than the wording choices. The movie has a glitzy look about it, this is Hollywood through and through and yet that doesn't matter, it feels raw enough to be believable and the stars of the movie are not famous enough for this to be yet another big budget action thriller movie, that tries too hard to be cool. The cars are for me not that nice, the one thing that really gets annoying after a while is bright green cars etc with racing stripes of fire, the cars go fast and this is good for petrol heads, but the look of it is pretty awful.I said about the stunts and there is no denying the stunts are good, there not gravity defying like so many of the sequels(Fast and Furious 7 has just left cinemas at the time of this review), they are well done and basic, sure the effects used in the cars whilst racing is ridiculous, but the fast crashes and kind of crazy things that go on, make this exciting and personally I enjoyed it quite a little bit.You know I hear a lot of people claim this is ""only for the boys"", but please disregard that, not only it being sexist but also that this actually contains depth in the story, not just mindless racing. I mean the depth is pretty high up, this only just scrapes the surface but it still has more than the cars. I felt the plot which I will not ruin for those who haven't seen, is good and it makes this kinda fun but at the same time thrilling, you honestly don't know what will happen, and although the story does play out rather basic, It still contains a fun story.Overall this is one fast paced movie I can recommend, now don't be won over by it like so many can, this honestly isn't a masterpiece of any kind, but still worth a view. I didn't feel bored at any times, all my focus was on the characters and how they develop and I think that you too can enjoy it, If you focus on one particular part, and not the cheese that this movie truly is.",The Fast and the Furious
132,Cinemaniac1984,Overrated and over-hyped,2,4 January 2015,"I believed all the hype when The Fast and the Furious first came out as everybody was talking about how awesome the movie was. Upon hiring this out on video I felt totally cheated. The Fast and the Furious is one of the most overrated and over-hyped movies I have ever seen. As far as I'm concerned this is just brainless, action packed, testosterone fueled eye candy designed to attract teenagers who need lessons in how to act cool. Following the total disappointment of The Fast and the Furious, I vowed never to watch any of the sequels.If you have seen Point Break (a far more enjoyable movie), you get the idea of what the whole movie is about. Basically it is about a police officer played by Paul Walker (for a police officer in his late 20's, he behaves like a teenager who is too cool for school) who goes undercover to infiltrate the illegal street racing scene in order to investigate a series of hijackings led by Vin Diesel, who is the leader of the street gang responsible for the hijackings as well as the undisputed king of the street racing scene.The rest of the characters are nothing more than one dimensional testosterone filled, swaggering gangster show offs and super sexy bad girls.The Fast and the Furious is peppered with many lame one liners. ""I live my life a quarter mile at a time"", takes the cake as one of the worst one liners.Although The Fast and The Furious is still a popular movie with a large fan base, there is very little to like about this overrated, brainless and over-hyped rubbish. I'm very surprised the franchise has continued on, however I still think that surely it would have run out of petrol by now. Perhaps one day, the franchise will drive off into the sunset for good.2/10",The Fast and the Furious
133,josh_lambert1991,Quite average,6,26 January 2019,When writing this there have been 6 fast and furious films and I cannot see why after this first film. It's not a particularly bad film but I cannot see any reason for so many sequels. The acting is ok at best and the storyline was quite poor so surprised it has got as far as it has.,The Fast and the Furious
134,stevenrotherforth,4K Blu-ray gives this movie a nice tune up,9,22 August 2019,"The Fast and the FuriousThis is the movie that started the mega franchise we all know of today.
However the series stalled and ran out of gas after the third entry and it was only when Fast Five offered a overhaul did the franchise get back on track.
I personally think the fifth instalment is the best of the bunch but only winning by an inch not a mile.
2001's 'The Fast and the Furious comes in close second and is actually a loose remake of Kathryn Bigelow's 'Point Break' but with cars instead of surfboards.'TFATF', we'll call it that because I can't be arsed to keep writing out the full title is directed by Rob Cohen and stars Vin Diesel and the late Paul Walker.
Walker plays Officer Brian O'Conner who goes undercover to catch a gang of truck robbers.
By doing so he gets embroiled in the world of street racing.
'TFATF' is pure carnogaraphy. If like me you're a petrol head then this movie will be right up your alley.
Performances by all are fantastic, especially from Diesel as hard-man Dom Toretto and the aforementioned Paul Walker. All cast members are great and one of this films less talked about attributes is the strong character development of those onscreen.Action is a plenty in this movie and at the time of release the Car racing sequences did move the game on.
'TFATF' is borderline silly unlike the sequels which have become even more ridiculous with each latest instalment.On 4K Blu-ray 'TFATF' looks good. A thin layer of grain lays over a mostly crisp image. This is the best this movie has ever looked. The grain gives the movie a cinematic look and the refreshed transfer is packed with detail.
HDR allows the paintwork of the wonderful automobiles to pop like never before.
Skin tones can sometimes
look a little over baked for my taste but overall the film does look sublime.
The blue of Paul Walkers eyes make him look like one of those creepy dudes from Game Of Thrones, but this is testament to how good HDR is on this transfer.
Audio gets a belting DTS X mix and this is one to bring the house down.
Bass is really punchy. So much so that I had to disengage the Dynamic EQ on my Home Theatre receiver.
The films soundtrack pumps out with a beat so heavy furniture may move.
Surround effects are constant and height channels are working overtime. This DTS X
mix is best described as being rather Furious.I enjoyed revisiting this movie.
It's been given a new lease of life on 4K Blu-ray.",The Fast and the Furious
135,BrnzReviews,Everything The Current Movies Should Be!,8,28 April 2021,"The Fast & Furious series is an interesting one in my opinion it started off here with this movie. This movie was great, the right amount of story with racing but now we have rocket cars in the sky which is too crazy for your typical racing film.This movie is a MUST WATCH its a good one highly recommend this!",The Fast and the Furious
136,EthanBJones_03,There's some enjoyment to be had but it's just alright; Would Recommend,6,21 April 2017,"​Directed by Rob Cohen​ Starring: Paul Walker, Vin Disel and Michele RodriguezPlot Overview: After many trucks have been raided by unknown race drivers, the FBI sends in undercover cop Brian O'Connor(Paul Walker) to infiltrate infamous driver, Dominic Torretto(Vin Disel)'s team and uncover who's behind all this.# NO SPOILERS!Overall: While this movie does include some enjoyable elements, I don't think it deserved a franchise to spawn from it. Most of the lead actors were pretty weak, the story was meh but it was pretty entertaining. It is also a very quotable movie with 'You can have any drink... as long as it's a Corona' being a quote that has become surprisingly popular. The movies main focal point(its races) were also pretty weak which is stupid considering that was what this franchise was founded on. In conclusion, it's enjoyable and I recommend it, but don't expect much.The types of people who will like this movie will be people who enjoy car movies and movies including races.Would Recommend.# POSSIBLE SPOILERS!Paul Walker was fine as Brian O'Connor and the supporting cast was reasonable. Vin Disel was very weak as Dominic Toretto and he's just not a very good actor. People say that he 'keeps this franchise together' but I argue it would be better without him. It's been proved he can't act and that's never been so obvious that these movies. I liked the ending. The premise and overall story, however, were very stupid and didn't work.I liked the cinematography for the most part but I feel like the actual RACE sequences were very poorly done and looked incredibly stupid.The effect were pretty poor. The actual set and costume design was nice.This movie was entertaining from start to finish and that is what it set out to do so I will assume it succeeded in that respect. It also introduces all the characters well and gives them reasonable roles in the story. I will say that the dialogue in this movie is actually not terrible and 'You can have any drink... as long as its a Corona' is just a fun quotation. I will also say that the music didn't fit for the most part and felt out of place.Personally, I enjoyed the movie all the way through but its not something I can see myself going back to constantly because I just don't see much point to it. It has its moments and some scenes were cool but it just doesn't provide enough to kick off a franchise nor does it deserve to be this popular among fans.6/10",The Fast and the Furious
137,theshadow908,Exciting for the racing scenes. The rest of the movie...Not so much.,5,7 May 2006,"The Fast and the Furious tells the story of an undercover cop who infiltrates a gang of street racers looking for the person who's been organizing highway robberies against transport trucks. However, the deeper he gets, the more like them he becomes. I personally think that this movie had potential to be really good, but instead it was just okay.I'll start off with what made the movie worth watching. Cars, cars, and more cars. Anyone that likes fast cars and cars racing and cars crashing will definitely get their share from this film. All of the racing scenes are expertly filmed with the camera examining the engine and the exhaust pipe as the car speeds up. There's also the fact that the film involves cops and robbers, so there's violence and gunfights as well. Unfortunately, that's about it...The plot isn't terrible, but it could have been better developed. It isn't complicated enough. The plot is really simple. I don't want to say that not enough happened, because it did have enough, but there was just something about it that didn't seem complete. And the acting? Well, as you can expect, the acting wasn't that great. Paul Walker looked bored half the time, like he didn't want to be there. Vin Diesel? Well he's just a bad actor anyway. Overall, The Fast and the Furious is a fun action film, but if you take it seriously...It sucks.5/10",The Fast and the Furious
138,HelenMary,"Point Break, the remake or an homage",7,28 November 2015,"Paul Walker playing Keanu Reeves, even down to his voice and choice of sandwich (albeit different bread); Point Break is one of my favourite films, and I really enjoy Fast and Furious but it is more or less a play by play copy of the surf-ace movie ten years on. Vin Diesel is the Bodhi-esque sensei-master surrounded by his acolytes and is convincing; it's one of his best roles (along with Pitch Black 1). He's a powerhouse. The film is attractive, stylish with a hot soundtrack and showcases the street-racer subculture in Los Angeles.Paul Walker isn't just an ersatz Reeves, he is glorious in his own right; beautiful, sexy, tough, controlled and engaging and his chemistry with Jordana Brewster (Dom Toretto's little sister) was nice, but is overshadowed by the bromance between Dom and Brian. Michelle Rodriquez is a great female foil for Diesel; she's gorgeous and convincing as a high-octane junky.Hey, F&F is never going to win awards for the most intelligent film in existence but it's pretty, amusing in places, a little cheesy and poorly dubbed but good cinema and must have had something to spawn itself into one of the largest grossing film franchises of all time. It plays like a music video, with touches of CSI in the filming but much of it is a little pointless and OTT. Vin Diesel is perfect as Dom and his chemistry with all the characters is sparkling. He plays the showman well. Paul Walker is gorgeous, he really is a loss to the acting world, and this film is his magnum opus. Walker and Diesel were obviously buddies and as such it makes this film all the more special. It's great cinema but is definitely flawed, especially in the realm of script. Don't take it too seriously, strap on your petrol-head and enjoy.",The Fast and the Furious
139,nobbytatoes,great action cant save a crumbling script,5,28 November 2005,"Welcome to the world of street racing. Fast sleek car, hot women, and lots and lots of money. The man everyone looks to is Dominic, but he is being put under investigation by undercover cop Brian. There have been hijackers robbing trucks of their merchandise and Dominic is the main suspect. Though Brian is on the case, his judgment is clouded when he befriends Dom, but more to when he becomes infatuated by Dom's sister Mia.The Fast and the Furious is a head first trip into the world of underground street racing; but the film doesn't do it justice. It doesn't explore the notion of why people do it and just shows us that street racers are petty crimes looking for a break. The plotting is paper thin and the dialog is so hammed; they sound childish. The guys gruff their way through not showing much intelligence and the girls are given this fragile ego. All the actors try to look tuff but they don't show any sign of intimidation. The have surly looks but are giant pussy cats. They should have gotten lesson from Clint Eastwood on how to be a tough guy.Rob Cohen, though not a favourite director, does have en eye for action sequences. Most of the time his direction is very heavy handed, but when the action starts he is in his foray. The action is high energy and come at a relentless pace. He does get you right in the middle of it. Though the problem is that it doesn't keep its impact over time. Once you've seen it a few times the car chases don't really have the same intensity they had when you first saw it.It fast and has a very slick look to it, but with a script lacking development and very mediocre acting, not even the good car chases can save it from it plot holes.",The Fast and the Furious

Paul Walker plays LAPD officer Brian O' Connor, who is sent undercover to investigate a gang of street-racers, all portrayed by Vin Diesel as Dominic Toretto, Jordana Brewster as his sister Mia, and Michelle Rodriguez as his girlfriend Letty. But then, he starts having feelings for this particular group, and has no idea whether to bust them or not. This really is a thrilling, and exciting film. Who doesn't enjoy watching car races, hot ladies, and rocking music? The race scenes are exciting and fun, and they steal the whole movie. But I don't really think this movie should be called an ""excellent"" movie, but instead a ""cool"" movie. Vin Diesel and Paul Walker are two of the toughest guys ever seen on film, so it was really fun watching them racing cars, shooting guns, and beat up people. But neither one of them gives a special performance. The story may sound like a crazy concept, but it is original. It's neither a remake or a reboot of classic car race films. Anyways, if you're interested in watching a classic movie with chase scenes, hot ladies, explosive bombs, and tons of violence, you won't be disappointed.

So while he is on the case he joins up with Dominic (Vin Diesel) who is one the best street racers and together they bring the bad guys down! The best chasing scene is the one where after they are street racing Dominic gets chased by the cops and ditches them. I really thought the car the Vin Diesel drove was really cool. The one he drives at the end of the movie kind of look liked the car he drove in the movie XXX. But it was a big shame that Vin Diesel wasn't in the sequel but he wasn't able to be in the sequel due to the fact that he was busy with a different movie at the time when 2 Fast 2 Furious was in either pre-production or post-production.

143,Puroo,Cut the chit chat. We want to see racing!,4,23 September 2021,"If I were alive in my full senses in 2001 and had seen The Fast and the Furious, there is no way I could have possibly thought that this film will turn into a full blown franchise in the coming years. I mean the whole concept of these films is basically the cutscenes of a Need for Speed game. But still since I thought probably this franchise is supposed to be about something other than that too, I decided to give it a watch just to prove myself wrong. And I was wrong. This franchise isn't just about the racing. It's also about talking, talking and even more talking.The Fast and the Furious is not exactly a kind of a film that I would call memorable. The only scenes I remember from it are the beginning where Brian does the illegal street racing, the part where his secret identity is blown up and where the team is doing the truck stunts (I only remember that part because of the meme template). Other than that when it comes to this film, my mind literally goes blank. And wouldn't it be? I was watching it without subtitles in the metro while travelling for college. When I do this I only remember the most memorable scenes from a movie. From here I only remembered that much.I really liked the character of Brian. It's really sad that Paul Walker is no longer with us. He's literally the reason why I decided to continue watching this franchise, otherwise I'd have given up just like I did for Stuart Little, Hotel Transylvania and Jurassic Park. Thankfully this franchise becomes better with the sequels and redeems the name. I also liked Dominic in this film (but just this one). His dialogue about not mattering whether we lose by an inch or a mile really made me ponder a lot.Honestly this really goes above my head how a film with so much talking turned into what it is today. It's like if you don't give up on a bad film you can actually create an empire and then redeem your old films (looking at you Warner Bros). This film has gained a cult status among the fans and I respect that decision. I would have loved to rewatch this film to prove myself wrong, but remembering how much talking happens in it and the fact that it doesn't have the same payoff as a superhero or sci-fi movie really turns me off.",The Fast and the Furious

The cast for the most part are good in their roles including Paul Walker, Vin Disiel, Michelle Rodriguez, Jordana Brewster, Rick Yune, and Ted Levine but some of them (Yune and Levine to name a few) lack screen time. Ja Rule even makes a brief extended appearance but his character like others aren't in it that much to leave an impression. The racing sequences are intense but there's some you can tell is obviously CG which is okay because thats the only way they could ever show the characters going so fast in the movie. The action sequences are well executed but some of them can over the top at times. The dialogue wasn't the greatest at times either and there were some predictable things that happened. For those of you who have seen it you might know I'm talking about. If you're a fan of these type of films than you might like this one better than I did.

154,HenryHextonEsq,An absolute farrago that frankly fails to entertain.,2,16 September 2001,"I gave this film every chance, but at every turn I could not quite believe the extent of its failure as both entertainment and film-making. My mind was much as antagonized as were my ears by this film's far from unique blend of noise, nonsense and numbskullery.Rarely if ever have I been rendered so disinterested in a movie's opening in particular than with this film. No attempt is made to draw the viewer in whatsoever, with shoddy direction of unrelated, uneventful scenes. The ""effect"" of the car scenes is but one-trick-schtick. The music is unimaginatively chosen, and in its blaring merely adds to the unsubtle, dulling overall effect of such scenes. There really is nothing original or particularly impressive about the director's use of visuals and sound.The acting is resolutely bad in a semi-laughable vein. If this ""Diesel"" chap is one of Hollywood's ""brightest up-and-coming stars"", he does little to show why here. His one-note performance consists merely of risible, cliched ""hard man"" posturing, inane shouting and a touch of the insufferably phony. This actor exudes none of the magnetism and genuine cool of, say, Robert Mitchum or Paul Newman, who could both act a bit as well... Diesel and Paul Walker, as the two leads, really do fail to induce any interest. The token ""emotional"" stuff is, as others have commented, utterly laughable. That one pathetic scene of this ilk has caused other reviewers to brand the film ""multi-layered"" and the like, is even more laughable. Trite lines delivered in a stilted, faux-sincere manner make for unintentional amusement and nothing besides. The main female actors are just as ineffectual; their characters are so thin they may as well have been reduced to the eye candy status of various other female ""extras"" on show throughout the film. That is not say, mind you, that genuine allure is generated at any stage... it's all rather perfunctory and sanitized.The plot? Well, indeed I don't *expect* such action movies to be well scripted and interesting, but it would make a change if one actually was. There is no serious attempt to provide a cohesive story line, attempt to twist the formulaic or be at all offbeat. The bones of this script are chronically malnourished and boundlessly bare. The way plot strands are introduced and just as soon discarded without reason, just illustrates this. The writers and director are either being condescending to their target audience, or, remarkably inept - if they consider this script of any merit at all. Also, the lack of humour renders the film toothless, with the drag racing culture dully and unconvincingly put across. It all just comes across as moronic, violent and slightly sordid. The film also fails to show the side of the law with any gravitas, realism or interest, besides the incredulity stirred within me at the sight of a police/FBI headquarters in the form of some mansion equipped with a swimming pool...! The very vagueness of Paul Walker's character and the subplot centering around Diesel's activities, is matched by the equally vague and unconvincing way the police are portrayed.This is a movie with no focus, fascination or indeed, ""fury"" if you will, beyond a facile, faltering nihilism. An assault on the senses it may well be, but it is a rather hollow and unprovoked assault.Rating:- */*****",The Fast and the Furious
155,Shiva-11,"Big, dumb, fast and fun",6,23 June 2001,"Big dumb fast and fun.I was talking with a friend of mine who is into customizing cars  - he has a gorgeous Honda Accord that has a new addition every time I see him - when I saw the first trailers for this movie.  We agreed that there would be some great cars, gorgeous women, awesome racing sequences and people condemning the film for irresponsibly promoting street racing.  All our suspicions proved correct, but most surprising was the lateness of the negative publicity for the film - I didn't see an article until today (interesting side note, the author had been cruising the international custom car bulletin boards for weeks trying to get interviews, but no one would bite). 
Blond haired blue-eyed Brian Spindler is sent to find the people responsible for several precision big rig hijackings.  He searches for his quarry among the street racing gangs of LA, where he meets and tries to ingratiate himself with Dominic Torreto, the prince of the racing set.  Brian soon finds himself in the middle of a bubbling gang war, and is being pressured by his superiors to get a bust. Things get complicated when Brian finds himself falling for Dominic's sister and at odds with the other members of Dom's crew.  But just when he thinks things can't get any worse, Brian gets an unpleasant surprise.I'm not going to rave about an intricate plot, zippy well scripted dialogue or in-depth character studies, because they simply aren't present, indeed there are several laughingly bad lines, and the acting is generally subpar This film is about action, and the sequences are some of the best to grace the movie screen  in a long time:  the driving is phenomenal, that stunts are amazing (no digital enhancement here) and the cars are very impressive. Although the film is a little over the top in some aspects - not every car customizer uses Nitrous Oxide or races their cars (most would be terrified that they might scratch or god forbid crash, their cars)- I think they have managed to capture the spirit of this unique subculture.   The acting is definitely a mixed bag.I've enjoyed Vin Diesel's roles, even though I've not been that enamoured of the films he's been in.  In a recent interview, he explained that he's drawn to anti-heroes as he finds them more interesting than the white shirted good guys, and I tend to agree with his observations.  As Diesel recently stated, Dominic is a man of his word, who believes in honor, but happens to ""live outside the law"" and his is the only character that is adequately fleshed out in the film.   Paul Walker plays Brian as possibly the most inept undercover cop to grace the screen - the only way he could stand out more in the group he's trying to infiltrate would be to wear a Village People costume.  Donnie Brasco he ain't.   This is exacerbated by the fact that Walker's portrayal is virtually bereft of any real emotion, and his soulless delivery of several corny lines renders them even worse than they were written- quite a feat.  The biggest disappointment for me was the waste of Michelle  Rodriguez - who distinguished herself in ""Girl Fight"" - whose soul purpose is to linger on screen and scowl.  A tremendous waste of a valuable commodity.If you're looking for a punchy matinee, without a lot of dialogue or plot to get in the way, settle in for the ride.",The Fast and the Furious
156,Bruce722,Great modern classic!,9,1 June 2013,"There aren't many movies over the last dozen years to have a bigger impact on society than this one. The Fast and the Furious glorified street racing and made the Honda Civic and the other cars featured in the film must buys for teenage boys across America. The reason is pretty obvious, the movie is outstanding. The cast of Paul Walker, Vin Diesel, Jordana Brewster, and others is outstanding and the story is really interesting and unique. The plot and characters are all really well developed, creating an immersive viewing experience not often seen in movies under two hours. The cars and race scenes are fantastic and the action has you sitting on the edge of your seat. The only negative for me was some of the cinematic effects. The director tried to get cute and a lot of those effects actually hurt the scenes, not helped. Nonetheless, those few sequences aren't enough to ruin the film and the entertainment value for the movie is still sky high.",The Fast and the Furious
157,pkzeewiz,one of those movies that is aimed at a certain type of person,3,14 April 2010,"If you devote every dime you get into a little ugly car that runs fast has loud speakers so you can play annoying rap music and show it off to your other idiot friends...yea you know if you are one of those types...dork...An undercover cop poses as a street racer so he can find out who is responsible for the hijacking of trucks and the valuable equipment inside. The cop, Brian gets in so deep and close to the group of guys that he doesn't want to bust them when he finds out the truth and yadda yadda.I like car movies and good chases, but this was a bit too cheesy for me. With all the clichés, the bad dated rap music, the little ugly cars that aren't at all cool. As I said the people who are into that junk eat these movies up, but I think they are so cheesy, all the ""bros"" and slang these people use is annoying as hell...I wanted them all to die - crash and burn you fools.It has a lot of races, and some action, but still tame by real action standards..Rob Cohen makes a lot of those big budget wanna be action movies, some are okay, but I think his big star casting choices hurt his films. They sell at the box office, but we real movie fans hate these big hyped actors that are ""Hollywood's finest"" - yea Hollywood's most overrated..Paul Walker is a horrible actor, he does good in movies about surfers, but I could never take him serious as a cop or a bad a**. Although he was good in Running Scared...Vin Diesel is just one of those actors that sucks but hes big and muscular and gained a big fan base and he keeps getting these roles because of his size. He was great in Pitch Black, but after that I wish he had quit. The guy playing Vince, Matt Schulz is another very horrible actor. Poor Ja Rule, I like Ja Rule, not his music or his acting but I think he seems like a cool guy, but he shows here he cannot act.I will say I am a fan of Michelle Rodriquez and think although she plays the same character in everything shes ever done, I still like her. Ted Levine is one of my favorite actors so nice to see him here.This film isn't horrible, but it isn't a great action film. It has a lot of big stars, big production and big hype but it's not got the story and action to back it up... I give it 3 out of 10 stars because it had its moments.",The Fast and the Furious

159,smellthecult-com-1,Need for Speed: Most Wanted: The Movie,7,24 December 2009,"Super charged car porn actioner starring Vin 'One Chin' Diesel as chief organiser and main speed demon in an underground street racing gang, the lawless swine. Paul Walker plays Brian O'Conner, a man so gosh damned handsome you pray for a head on collision so that some flying shrapnel can ruin his all American looks, the new kid in town who foolishly bets away the pink slip to his own car in a race he fails to win, meaning the vehicle winds up belonging to Chin Diesel. Through scenes of dialogue so macho the directors hand appears intermittently to wipe seminal fluid off the camera lens O'Conner wheedles his way into the affections of Diesel, much to the annoyance of several of his gang members. What Chin doesn't realise is that O'Conner isn't all that he seems. He's a bloody copper. Cue the inevitable divided loyalties as the police start to close in on the street racers and O'Conner must choose between his job and his squeeze. So, the plot is utter drivel and all but a remake of Point Break, but it matters not, kids. Gather round, now, gather round. It's all about the action as souped up 'rides' go fender to fender at speeds that are, quite frankly, perilous. Honestly, somebody could get hurt. Terrible in almost every sense, the high speed chaos more than makes up for it so, if you can find it in yourself to just switch your brain off and just go along for the ride, you may well enjoy this.",The Fast and the Furious

With the headbanger's music in the background, it's the perfect setting for the younger crowd of today.  The special effects in this film is all right, but not that spectacular.  Walker makes this role work, but the only thing I don't believe is that he doesn't have some kind of partner working a little closer.  He's just a little too young for this kind of take on...but, then again, I thought Brian Bosworth was a useless piece of work when it came to the movie, ""Stone Cold.""

162,MF210,A Good Popcorn Movie,8,29 September 2003,"My Rating: *** out of ****. Its safe to say the Fast and the Furious is not an intelligent movie. However, that does not mean it is not entertaining. This is definitely escapist entertainment, or a popcorn movie like many people like to call them. Vin Diesel is impressive, he has a presence when on screen and he doesnt screw up when delivering his lines. This performance elevated him into stardom and I can definitely see why. Paul Walker is only adequate though, he pales when hes next to Diesel. Jordana Brewster makes Mia into a very appealing character. Michelle Rodriguez is once again playing a tough girl. Rick Yune is effective as the bad guy. Fast and the Furious does have a few bad lines but that is expected in some summer movies. Mostly the dialogue is fine. The car races and chases are well shot. The film has a few scenes that are a bit overlong but the movie will mostly hold your attention.",The Fast and the Furious

However, there is a reason that it was 8 years until you saw this crew together again. The racing was enjoyable but the acting was mediocre (especially Paul Walker).While this film gets points for launching one of the most popular film franchises in history, the plot is jumbled and much of it lacks real purpose. It seems like the writers had a bunch of ""good ideas"" and threw them on a board before half-heartedly putting them in a plausible order to create a plot. The fight scene on the semi-truck seems completely out of place (put it after Jesse's death instead) and the final 1/4 mile with Dom and Brian is a forced.Overall, the film has heart, the cast has chemistry and I'm glad it happened, I just didn't like watching it.",The Fast and the Furious

Paul Walker is the young motor enthusiastic with a taste for speed who strives to prove himself to street racing icon Vin Diesel and his gang of race crazy mates, not forgetting his very sexy sister!

166,The_Orenda,Remains a decent racing film.,7,16 October 2007,"Even after two sequels, Fast and the Furious kept the racing genre very well alive in the 2000s. The film still retains much of the fast action, well paced storytelling and cheesy, yet clever, one-liners. As far as thrillers go, it's pretty hard to beat the botched hijacking scene for one and for Vin Diesel himself, still his best movie by far.Brian seeks out Dominic Torreto. ""He likes the tuna,"" he says, at Toretto's restaurant but Brian lives a double life, and that role is quickly trying to find answers behind several truck hijackings before the truckers take the matters into their own hands.Furious retains this stylish edge that many films lose over time. I also remain impressed with the total conviction behind Johnny Tran's words by Rick Yune. The movie remains an excellent example towards timing and editing and let's never forget the beauty of the cars and engines themselves. Fast and the Furious is everything you would want from a racing movie.",The Fast and the Furious

168,schroeder-gustavo,Fast Paced action,8,21 September 2015,"The one that started it all, The original Fast and the Furious is a movie that I think is often forgotten. Fans and casual viewers alike think of the extremely over the top impossible action sequences the newer Furious movies have become. But few remember that once upon a time, it was about street racing and boosting trucks.While it is essentially a Point Break remake with cars instead of surfers, the Fast and the Furious manages to stand on its own and be a thoroughly entertaining movie. The dialogue is pretty stupid at times and some stuff that happens doesn't always make sense, but the movie never fails to entertain.The Fast and the Furious is probably too good to be considered a guilty pleasure, but too bad to be considered a great movie, so I'll just say, even if it's stupid at times, and over the top, The Fast and The Furious is without a doubt a very entertaining movie I really enjoy watching every once in a while.",The Fast and the Furious
169,extravaluejotter,Turbocharged Shopping Trolley,2,31 December 2006,"Despite some good action sequences - no, sorry, strike that - a good action sequence involving a bike/car chase toward the end of the movie, there's little to recommend ""The Fast and The Furious"" to anyone with a central nervous system.Vin Diesel tries his best but his performance is lost among a tribe of glove puppets and stick figures. Paul Walker looks great but makes Josh Hartnett The Wooden Boy look like Laurence Olivier. Michelle Rodriguez scowls and pouts so much that she actually looks like a bulldog for most of the movie. Jordana Brewster gives Katy Holmes a run for her money in the WET AS FISH stakes and Rick Yune is woefully miscast as a villain. Yune looks even better than Paul Walker but has all the acting ability of a packing crate. He needs to spend more of that money he made being pretty on acting lessons.Director Rob Cohen clearly hopes that layering on the surface glitz will distract an audience from the dull plot, thinly spread characterisation and unrealistic stunt driving in this movie.

171,Mikew3001,"The good, the bad and an ugly movie",5,28 June 2004,"Rob Cohen's ""The Fast And The Furious"" has been a box office hit, but is just a disappointment. It's much sight and sound, but like switching through the TV channels with a remote control with no contents at all. There's no hint of a story, just something about some bad young guys driving around in very fast cars, doing illegal and cool things like car races, tuning their turbo killing machines and doing very male stuff like beating the s*** out of themselves. There are some pretty girls as well in sweaty black t-shirts and a good guy who's in fact an undercover police officer who's searching for something and falls in love with the girls of the gang.Director Cohen's doesn't care at all about a script, a good story and good actors, he's just interested in the straight, fast and loud action of popcorn cinema, and you're getting a lot of that. There are dozens of well-shot car chases, showdowns, gun and fist fights, etc., but it all remains a heartless spectacle with too many stupid dialogues that should be only used in a Spinal Tap movie. The villain is bald and bad and played by Vin Diesel, the hero is blond and bright and played by Paul Walker, the other gang members have beards and are shouting like hell, and the girls are just there for completing the crew. Even the conflict of a policeman investigating undercover and becoming fascinated by a counter culture isn't developed well and explored at all like in William Friedkin's ""Cruising"" or Katheryn Bigelow's ""Point Break"" - it's just one more vague cliché presented on an assembly line, fastly running of course.If you like some mindless highway action you might find some good and entertaining scenes in this movie, but there are lots of better movies built around car chases and vehicle action - check out cult movies like the groovy ""Vanishing Point"", Steven Spielberg's ""Duel"", Walter Hill's ""Driver"", Norman Jewison's great ""Rollerball"" or the odd ""The Cars That Ate Paris"" by Peter Weir. ""The Fast And The Furious"" mainly quotes scenes from these movies and from other car chasing classics like ""French Connection"", ""Bullitt"", the ""Mad Max"", ""Terminator"" and ""Lethal Weapon"" series, and even James Dean's legendary car race in ""Rebels Without A Cause"" is ripped off here. But all in all you're just asking what it is all about and will find the answer in Shakespeare again - much ado about nothing.",The Fast and the Furious

I won't go into too much of the plot, because a lot of people should know what is the main premise of the story in this film and the other Fast and Furious movies. The franchise would later go to move away from the underground street racing plot into a plot much more cooler with the heist of $100 million dollars, gun fights and brawls and the movie that would change this franchise and bring new life into it would be the fifth entry in the series, released in April of 2011, Fast Five.The story is just really cool and amazing, but is not Oscar worthy, but the dialogue is the movie can get a little weak on a few occasions, but not throughout the whole darn movie.The action is just top-notch and the car chases in this film is as intense and action-packed as they would be later on in the franchise. My favorite car chase is at the beginning of the film and at the end of the film involving Dominic and Brian driving.The acting is just dreadful, but not all of it is. I will give credit to Vin Diesel, who plays Dominic Toretto and he pulls it off wonderfully, but while it's not Oscar worthy, he does show emotion, drama and laughter into his character. Michelle Rodriguez as Letty Ortiz, is great in this film and she would remain in that part for the other films and she would play in James Cameron's groundbreaking special-effects extravaganza Avatar and in the 2002 action-horror / zombie movie film based on the survival video game, Resident Evil.The other two that also does a great job is definitely Paul Walker and Jordana Brewster, who plays Brian O'Conner and Mia Toretto, and they do a very decent good job with the material written for them and they have such a great chemistry on the screen.Dominic Toretto's team members are just good. The actors who play the people in his crew is just incredible, with the exception of Matt Schulze as Vince.The music and soundtrack is really cool and Ja Rule is in this film, playing the role of Edwin and he provides music on the soundtrack.Overall, The first and original FAST AND THE FURIOUS is really good, but can get a little confusing in a few areas.

175,bannonanthony,"""I live my life a quarter-mile at a time."".",8,30 January 2003,"I have always loved movies which involve fast cars, so naturally I had to see this one. I definitely think that it's better to see it on video than in the cinema. I say this because I DID see it in the cinema, and I was sitting right next to a speaker at the time. My eardrums got a thorough assault, due to the roaring of powerful engines and a pounding heavy metal and techno score. But I still loved the picture. There is no shortage of action here and the performances are rather good, especially the rapidly-rising Vin Diesel as our anti-hero Dominic Toretto. Paul Walker may be listed above him in the credits, but for my money, Diesel is the main man here. The goods are certainly delivered in this film!SPOILERS AHEAD!Walker plays undercover cop O'Connor who infiltrates Toretto's gang of street racers in order to find out if they are involved in a series of hijackings which look like the work of skilled drivers. He at first is unwilling to believe that Toretto may have something to do with it due to the fact that Toretto appears to be a civil type (plus O'Connor is falling in love with his sister). It first appears that Toretto's rival, a violent, and quite psychotic, Triad-type named Johnny Tran, may be the guilty party. But this may be the easy solution. I had seen this picture before I had seen the earlier POINT BREAK, but as soon as I saw POINT BREAK, I could see similarties between the two. As with POINT BREAK, the easy answer is proved wrong and the truth turns out to be what you hoped wasn't true. The ending also has a similarity to POINT BREAK, which I won't reveal here. But these similarities do not mean that this film is not original. Far from it, the story is great with inventive twists and turns and you eventually find yourself rooting for Diesel.The two leads are brilliant as is Jordana Brewster as Toretto's sister Mia. In addition, Toretto's racing team are well drawn (well, three of them are anyway). There's Letty, the tough chick (and Toretto's girlfriend), Jesse, the geeky but lovable mechanical expert, Vince, the violent nutjob (who takes exception to O'Connor) and Leon, the other one (he has very little distinguishing characteristics). A pre-DIE ANOTHER DAY Rick Yune is truly menacing as the sadistic Tran. The cars are also brilliant. The real great ones are the Supra which thegang restores for Walker to race at an Arizona race event, the three black Honda Civics which are used for the hijackings (when did they actually start making cool-looking Civics?) and the black Dodge Charger Dieseldrives towards the end. Toretto states that he never drove the car before because itscared him. According to him, this car has 'so much torque that thechassis twisted when it came off the line', and it certainly proves itself in a final drag race near the end of the film. The music score may not be to everyone's taste, but the film is overall excellent. The sequel's not too bad either!",The Fast and the Furious
176,stratus_phere,Seriously?,5,18 February 2018,"Yes, this has spoilers. Stop reading if you don't want to know what's up at the end.This was such an odd movie because most of the main characters are bad guys. And not the kind who are just trying to steal bread to feed a starving family type of bad guys. Towards the end I'm rooting for the trucker to blow the heck out of most of the main characters. I'm rooting for Vin Diesel and his gang to die a bloody death for being ruthless thieves. Why on earth are they making movies with bad guys as the heroes?Sure, there were incredibly cool racing scenes, done as only American movie studios can do. But seriously, what the heck? Why are we idolizing dirty rotten thieves who attack innocent people and steal from them? I know there are a plethora of sequels, so I knew these guys wouldn't meet the justice they deserve. Such an odd movie. Will all the sequels be glorifying criminals?",The Fast and the Furious
177,blazesnakes9,"It coming at you, FAST AND FURIOUS.",7,7 May 2011,"Action movies consists on three things, fast cars, good chases and good actors and characters. In The Fast and the Furious, that is acceptable for a action movie. Vin Diesel stars as a street racer, who's friends dominated the streets with tricked out cars and exciting races on the streets of L.A. Paul Walker plays a cop, tracking Diesel. Together, they form a duo. They so discover that the street racing is causing theft to occur in L.A. So, it's up for Walker's character to tracked own these robbers before they hit again. The Fast and the Furious is a good action flick for the summer because it combined the energy level to high as the chases become greater and greater. As for Walker and Diesel, these guys know how to act. They know what's the game is. When the game is on, they go at it. Their formula together is very good and the action sequences are really astonishing. As for the car chases, they are somehow very neat and well made. All in all, The Fast and the Furious is a heart pounding, fast and furious ride from start to finish. ★★★ 3 stars.",The Fast and the Furious
178,kaden_lewis,The Fast and the Furious,8,1 July 2021,"This was a solid movie. Sure, it was super cheesy, the acting was questionable (It gets way better later in the series), and the plot was kind of funny, but other than that, I really enjoyed this movie, it was the one that started it all, a saga currently 20 years in the making. I have seen all the movies, and it is cool to look and see the original crew, Dom, Letty, Jesse, Leon, and Vince. I mentioned the plot was kind of funny, but the story was great. I loved how Brian was an undercover cop but in the process, he became close with Dom, his sister Mia, and most of his crew. The ending made the movie, it was great, and it was that point that set up the entire Saga.I definitely recommend this to anyone who wants to watch it. It is a great movie to watch anytime, and it also opens you up to an entire Saga of movies.**A lot of people don't know this, but there is a Credit Scene at the end of the credits.**",The Fast and the Furious
179,Mr. Pulse,Dumb- and proud!,6,30 June 2001,"The Fast and The Furious is one of the most unapologetically stupid movies to come along in a while.  It's about a bunch of drag racers, but really, it's all about the drag racing itself.  The filmmakers know this, so they spent all their time on that stuff, and basically ignored usually important elements like plot, conflict, and dialogue.  The result is a movie that is extremely watchable, but nevertheless very, very dumb.If you care about plot, you obviously are thinking too hard at this movie. Still, TF&TF is about a few drag racers, led by Turetto (Vin Diesel), who gets mixed up with new kid on the block Brian (Paul Walker).  We quickly learn Brian's a cop, looking for some guys who rip off semi trucks while they are driving.  Anyway, by the end of the movie the film is so wrapped up in thrills and big explosions and things smashing into one another, it basically gives up on the plot, doesn't bother resolving several of the conflicts (Including Brian's weird love interest with Turetto's sister).The acting and dialogue are truly laughably bad.  When Vin Diesel says a line like ""I live my life a quarter mile at a time...for those ten seconds or less, I'm free."" I certainly laugh-how does he keep a straight face? These are lines that porn actors would have trouble delivering straight! Diesel is ideal for this role; he's physically intimidating (Paul Walker looks downright wussy next to him) and his no-emotion acting style really allows him to say stuff that other actors might actually think about when they delivered them and realize just how stupid they were going to sound.Still, the racing stuff is very exciting, and a heist involving an angry truck driver is truly thrilling (Even though I didn't care one iota about who lived or who died).  Even though there's a big plot hole in that scene, it'll be hours before you realize it.  The conclusion is exciting AND humorous; yet makes absolutely no sense whatsoever.  This film is in-the-moment enjoyable, groan-worthy in retrospect.Rob Cohen, director of the atrocious Daylight, and the slightly-less-atrocious, but still-pretty-horrible The Skulls, is a little better here, wisely avoiding to bathe all his pretty characters in golden halos of backlight and instead going for a much more realistic look.  He's probably aided by the exciting material not the other way around.  I'm still not convinced he's a good director.Anyway, sad to say, I enjoyed this movie far more than just about any other action movie this summer...as lame as it is, it stays fairly enjoyable throughout.  In a lot of places, the car-chase free parts stay fun cause the people talking sound so completely stupid.  I laughed, I was entertained, I wished there were more movies out like Memento.",The Fast and the Furious

So I went back to the original Fast and the Furious from 2001, which I originally catch glimpses of when I was 8 years old, but I remember the plot being too complicated for me to follow so I didn't enjoy it as much.The Fast and the Furious lives up to its namesake. Fast cars and furious action that has spurred the cult following for the past 14 years. Aside from the souped-up cars and racing scenes with no seemingly no real purpose, the plot is dry with many loopholes. This film is not for the serious and critical movie goer, it is the typical man movie. I can see why it has earned itself such a following over the years, but this movie wasn't my cup of tea.

182,kyle_c,Terrible,4,6 June 2002,"""The Fast and the Furious"" is basically your standard summer blockbuster - stupid, loud, and lots of explosions.  Amazingly, this movie sinks to depths that most summer blockbusters have never reached.The story surrounds an undercover FBI agent (Paul Walker) who is trying to find out who has been stealing electronics equipment.  This leads him to a group of underground street drag racers.  Despite the numerous plot holes, such as the idiotic way in which the criminals go about stealing the equipment, and Walker's inexplicable behavior, this movie actually could've been good.  The premise is interesting, and the drag racing scenes are fairly exciting.Where this movie falters is the characters.  None of them are interesting, and despite the script's best efforts, they are all two-dimensional.  The performances are awful, with the exception of Vin Diesel, who is merely average.  Walker delivers his stupid catch phrases inconvincingly monotone. Perhaps the script is much to blame here, for I've often believed that good performances are highly influenced by the script, i.e. a good actor can give a bad performance if the dialogue is bad.  Well, anyway, the dialogue is simply some of the worst in any big budget movie I've seen recently.On the plus side, the action sequences are pretty good.  However, this simply cannot make up for a senseless script and horrible acting.  Not really worth seeing, unless you really like action, with nothing to back it up.* 1/2 out of ****",The Fast and the Furious
183,mitchell5954,Not Great But Solid,6,17 August 2019,"Fast and the Furious franchise is one of the best examples of vicarious entertainment in the movie industry. Anyone who likes action, nice cars, racing, women etc. will find enjoyment from this movie and this franchise in one way or another. This film is a basic popcorn flic. There is not deep plot or deep characters here. So people looking for those elements in this film will be disappointed. However, most people probably knew not to expect such elements from a movie like this anyway, from the title to the trailers. I knew what I was getting when I watched this. So I enjoyed this film alright.The story isn't the most original. It's essentially Point Break, but admittedly done better, in my opinion. The characters are not great, though the characters are not what people are looking for in this movie anyway. The film stars Brian O'Conner, played by Paul Walker (RIP), who is an FBI agent. Paul Walker does fine overall in the film. His character I rooted for. However, I do not by for one second that this guy is an FBI agent. Nothing about his character makes be believe he would qualify for the FBI. When he tries to sound professional, it's not believable.Vin Diesel does good in the film as well. I am a fan of Vin Diesel as an actor. He is one of my favorite aspects of the film. Michelle Rodriguez is also in the film, but does not have that much to do. The side cast is fine. I did not really care for them, but I never found them annoying.The action and racing is the highlight of the film and it's done well. The races are fun, and the action (mainly car chases) will have you at the edge of your seat.Overall, I enjoyed the film. It's not a deep movie, but it's not supposed to be. It's a popcorn flick meant to appeal to guys, and especially teenage guys. That's why I call it vicarious entertainment. Every guy secretly dreams about being an action hero, driving a nice car, getting all the women. So many guys secretly would envision themselves as Paul Walker or Vin Diesel's character, or one of the other character in the film. That's why I say this is vicarious entertainment.",The Fast and the Furious

All of my friends are (or at least most of them) but it's something I never fell into as a kid.  Movies are my thing, not cars.  So, here I am, review The Fast and the Furious, and guess what? I loved it.I love a good car chase.  Nothing in this world can impress me more than a good car chase.  To this day, RONIN still has the best chases (with maybe the Blues Brothers coming in second), but The Fast and the Furious makes a valiant effort.  Okay, TFATF has a plot recycled from Point Break (which is justt slightly a better movie).  Sure, the car chases will inspire teens to drive like stampeding cows.  But, this is the best dumb movie of the summer.Tomb Raider was stupid beyond belief.  Pearl Harbor was like a dumb blond, she looks good but we all no there is no brain in her head.  The Mummy Returns was just one long action sequence with bad special effects. Swordfish tried to be smart (and was, for the most part).  But the Fast and the furious knows that it isn't the smartest girl at the ball, and it admits it.  This movie is about cars, babes, and, ummm, more cars.Yea, all of the cars are rice burning Hondas or Mitshubishis.  There is ONE Volkswagon though...So, it's not too bright, but it's fun.

Paul Walker and Vin Diesel work well as a team, despite Dom's attitude to the others but the friendship seemed a lot more geunine. Letty was a kewl character, they should have explored it more though. Mia was just another female added in to make Brian's character well a man off course.

It's like saying, ""Airplane"" was dumb because the characters were poorly developed and shallow, and the plot was unrealistic.""The Fast and the Furious"" is a great summer, action flick.  Definitely gets the heart pumping and the adrenaline flowing.  The chase and race scenes have some great stunts.  The cars are gorgeous and fun to watch.  I saw it over a week after it opened, and the audience was still very receptive to the action in this movie.Now this is where I am supposed to slam the plot and the acting.  Well, to be honest, I thought the plot was quite GOOD, given that all they had to work with was the theme of ""street racing.""  I didn't think the acting was all that bad.  The entire cast did fine, given the script they had and the kind of movie it was.  One fatal mistake many action movies try to do is weave in too much drama or emotion, which inevitably ends up looking cheesey and just slows down the movie.  FnF was guilty of this, but only to a small degree.  A brief dive into Vin Diesel's scarred childhood, a little bit of corny romance for Walker, but that's it.  I respect a movie that knows what it is and doesn't try to cross any lines.The movie makers set out to make a movie that presents Import Racing to the masses.  So they had to make a plot to house that movie.  Personally, I think they did a pretty good job.

They also both contained action scenes that were so ridiculous you could only smile at the the disgraceful way money is handed out to pretenders, sorry producers to make this crap.At least ""Point Break"" mixed the action scenes between sky diving and surfing rather than the mundane street racing over an over.

So who is responsible for this? Lets see... The director, Rob Cohen, has made such increadible films as The Skulls (yuck!) and Daylight (HAHAHAHA!). The writer, or should I say writers, made such crap as Hollow Man and Split Second (Gary Scott Thompson). The other writers can't boost with such ""successes"". :)Maybe I shouldn't ""review"" this boring and superembarrasing flick, because I turned it off after a while. I just couldn't stand it.

There is no need to say that this is the signature of the entire series. Whatever the plot is, there is always a street race going on and each one of them is masterfully shot and scripted. This series is first of all a tribute to the cars and the driving skills of their pilots.The other asset of this movie are Vin Diesel and Paul Walker. The first one is playing Dominic Torretto, all in muscle respected and regarded as the leader of the entire LA racing community. Like her sister Mia says, everyone is attracted and orbits around Dom.

200,RolloTomasi,"Just rent ""Point Break"" instead",5,6 July 2001,"""Fast and the Furious"" is largely a re-hash of ""Point Break."" The idea behind both films is similar: undercover cop infiltrates youth subculture to bust a faction of it that's committing real crimes. In ""PB"" the guy blending into the scenery is Johnny Utah (Keanu Reeves), who you'd easily mistake for a surfer. Johnny U. is actually interesting, actually seems to have a past, a life, a personality. But while ""Fast"" protagonist Brian O'Connor (Paul Walker) is heroic and likeable, we're never told anything about the guy. He wants to make detective, and so is doing his undercover tour of duty busting some auto mechanics turned bad. That's about all we're told, though. His character is defined by the circumstances he's in, not by the person he actually is.  Character and plot isn't exactly director Rob Cohen's number one priority here of course. For sheer high-speed thrills, ""Fast"" delivers the goods. Cohen saves the best for last. Three big high-speed chase scenes close it out. The finest of them, also the best action scene I've seen this year, is another hijacking involving a tractor/trailer. This time the trucker is ready for them, though. An exhilarating mixture of cross-cutting, directing and stunts, this was expert filmmaking. Then the film's creators find a way to keep it going, plotting a race car versus motorbike sequence, followed by a good old-fashioned old-versus-new drag race with railroad tracks serving as the finish line. Of course, there's a train coming at high speed. That's good stuff. By the time it's all over, you really feel like you got your money's worth. For me though, without a strong plot to push it along, it's all a waste.  Women in the audience might be disappointed that only one girl (Michelle Rodriguez of ""Girlfight"") gets to race (well, she wins anyway). The primary use this film has for women is showing them scantily-clad, putting themselves up as trophies for the winners of these races. Using women as props is nothing new to the action genre. Still, going into ""Fast"" I had hoped for better. Haven't we come to a point in movie history where it's safe to expect something for everyone? Whether you're a chick or a dude, you're unlikely to identify with any character in this.
Even a movie as dumbed-down as this tries to grow a brain now and again. One such moment in `Fast' involves Chad Lindbergh's character, Jesse. He's a genius about anything automotive. He builds the engines legendary street racer Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel, who's real name would've worked better) puts in his cars. He says the only reason he didn't go to, say, MIT, is that he suffers from A.D.D. With Jesse, the film raises the question of how a great mind may or may not be going to waste simply because he couldn't pay attention in class. He represents an entire demographic of kids with great potential on  the fast-track to nowhere. Who to blame? A society too dependent on social classes, diplomas and college degrees? Does a lack of direction justify choosing the criminal path? The film opens the issue, but has little to actually say about it.  ""The Fast and the Furious"" commits one too many transgressions against my sensibilities to recommend it, even on the strength of the action sequences. But do see ""Point Break"": more action, more style, much more of a plot, and better characters. It really is the whole package and besides, surfing is still cooler than street racing.

The plot is pretty irrelevant, but if you must know, think of this as Point Break on wheels instead of on a surf board and you'll know what I mean. Paul Walker does an admirable job in this flick, but doesn't really sell his character as an undercover cop. True..no one would ever believe he's a real cop, but even when he's acting like a cop, it's not convincing. Vin Diesel does a great job as Dominic Toretto. His deep voice and statured physic fits him perfectly for this role. This guy could be the next Arnold S. with the right script. He was sensational in Pitch Black, and just as good in The Iron Giant (voice of Iron Giant). This guy is going to go far.As for the movie, it was what I expected.

I went to see this expecting good race and action scenes and not much else, and it delivered. I didn't go in expecting Academy Award material, and anyone who saw the previews should've done the same. I thought some of the acting left something to be desired, but it was adequate for the movie. The action sequences were definitely the highlight of the movie, especially the street racing scenes. I didn't mind the plot holes or the paint-by-numbers romance side plot, I wanted action and I got it. I liked it so much I saw it again a few days later.

Although I have watched this movie before, I still watched it with excitement.The train scene in the last scene is legendary. Even though I watched this movie before, even now I watched the train scene with excitement, holding my breath.I wish it would have been better without erotic scenes in the movie. I was especially disgusted with the kiss of two women. The introduction of erotic scenes into such beautiful films shadows the quality of the film.",The Fast and the Furious
210,Tyson14,the first ride,7,28 March 2015,"It's strange that one of the best franchises in movie history started off with Vin Diesel stealing a bunch of VHS players. Make no mistake about it, under the corny dialogue, awful soundtrack, horrid direction, and a general sheen that makes it clear that this is a 2001-ass movie from 2001, this is also at its core a Fast & Furious movie. So in preparation for the impending release of Furious 7, let's look how the film that started it all held to the franchise's tenants of Life, Cars, and Family.Life: Although the ""I live my life a quarter mile at a time"" mantra is corny, I think it plays well in the streets of the film's world. A world where respect is everything, but that respect has to be both earned and backed-up with actions. It means taking big risks, knowing your priorities, but also living in freedom of choosing your own destiny. While Dom's arc here is learning to live with that freedom, by his own code of honour, and the consequences and all it entails, Brian's arc is about earning that respect and choosing how far he's willing to go to get it. It may not seem a lot, but I think it speaks a lot to their arcs throughout the entire series, especially when you see how awkward Brian is at the beginning, knowing he'll eventually become one of the coolest and most respected white dudes on the planet later.Cars: Although originally envisioned as a movie about street racing, the film actually grinds to a halt when people stop to race. Director Rob Cohen is as bad at directing as he is at acting (As that Pizza Hut guy annoyed by street racers) and manages to make the races both boring, but also hideous to look at. He adds several horrible effects to each racing scene to convey speed and excitement, both CGI and otherwise, but it never feels, or looks right, and they also never sound right. Seriously, when people aren't talking, Cohen turns the film into some god-awful ""nu-metal"" or ""rapcore"" music video. All he needed was to add some crunk, and he would have completed a devil's threesome of best-forgotten 00s music genres. What is good however is how Cohen handles the heist, which the series would eventually realise is much more interesting than racing, which they prove here. Cars drive under trucks, people jump from cars to trucks, and people jump from trucks to cars. It's nothing the series wouldn't do better later, but it's still edge-of-your seat classic action, complete with a last minute save by our hero, Brian. As for the cars themselves, the only truly memorable one is Dom's classic Charger, which plays heavily into his back story.Family: Again, this movie is strangely best when people are talking, and not racing. The film obviously establishes the code of honour and of respect, but it's also about family, which the series is ultimately about. I forgot that they go into Dom's back story here, and why family is so important to him as he establishes one in the absence of his father, while being welcoming to all who gravitate towards him. His code of family really drives the film, and his accepting of Brian builds both Brian's character of being a good man and saving Dom, but also Dom's appreciation of Brian not leaving him behind build's up Dom. Family doesn't leave each other behind, and they watch each other's back. The film tries to make us think Brian's desire to help Dom is Mia-based, but I think he just really wants to be apart of that family, and Ted Levine even says he has to make a choice about which family he wants to be apart of. He kind of chooses the police in this film, but his actions here come back where he finally makes his choice in Fast and Furious.Overall, if you can get past the horrible direction and how dated the film is now, there's actually a lot to like here from the above and beyond character work, to the heist gone wrong. I never cared for this film when it came out, but looking back it has the early shine of the elements I love of this series. It's flawed, but I still like it.

214,ryanskywalker-87402,"Still ""Fast"" after all these years",7,12 April 2017,"Rob Cohen's ""The Fast and the Furious"" has no business being as great as it is. A film about fast cars, undercover cops, and highway robbery should provide limited, perhaps dimwitted thrills, but Cohen's colorful and swift-paced action outing provides such likable characters, slick stunts, and buoyant spirit that the whole affair elevates itself to the highest levels of lively, well-assembled fun. It is a surprisingly robust and satisfying experience.The film follows an undercover police officer working to infiltrate the world of street racing to bust a low-level crime syndicate. While undercover, he develops an affinity toward the racers and inconvenient brotherhood is established. Between the cars, busts, and friendships, a token crime story becomes a tale of family. It is simply compelling and effortlessly entertaining.Cohen creates a multi-ethnic world of sunshine, turbo charged technology, and well-rendered characters. It is a Los Angeles of beautiful paint jobs, palm trees, and lived-in locations. Color, verve, and speed burst forth from Cohen's frames in layered and lively compositions. Editing, design, and music create an always- pulsing energy that permeates every sequence.Though the film is about racing and the thrills that drive the sport, Cohen cast actors that earn as much attention as the horse- powered rockets. Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, Jordana Brewster, Chad Lindberg, and Michelle Rodriguez form the family unit the inspires the film's themes and emotions. Each actor builds a solid character, with the leads being especially memorable. Diesel glowers and Walker exudes a naive charm. They form a charismatic duo.A slick and undeniably entertaining action gem, ""The Fast and the Furious"" soars with its combination of character and thrills. Set pieces are exciting, character beats are affecting, and the stunts are electrifying. It is a remarkable, sweat, oil, and sun-soaked piece of work.",The Fast and the Furious

216,Rhino Rover,Who needs good writing when you have fast cars and big crashes??,6,26 July 2001,"Depending on the age group you fall under, you may or may not like this movie. But then again, that's true of a lot of movies but this one seemed to have a very specific target audience and it seemed to be between the ages of 17 to 23 and predominately male. I fall outside of this age group but it doesn't mean a bad reviewit just means that it's not going to be a good review either. Well, it might. I guess you'll just have to read to the end of the review to find out. Typically movies aimed at this target audience tend to be high on the stunts and low on just about everything.Fast and Furious is about cars. Fast cars to be specific. And not the type that belongs on the race track but the kind that gets you arrested for going a zillion miles an hour down a city street in the middle of the night. This movie is about a young man that enters the underground life of street racing. Something that happens in every city. But apparently this past time is rather cliquish and getting in with the `in-crowd' isn't always easy nor does everyone accept you. It's not that different than belonging to a gang it seems. Get in with one group and you're the enemy of another group, which means that you're going to have the typical `turf war' issues. You're also going to have your `boy meets sister of big bad brother' side story and all the other issues that go along with it. There's a bit of a twist but nothing that I haven't seen in other gang/drug related movies that have something to do with young people. In fact this movie reminded me a lot of `Point Break' except I enjoyed that movie.If it sounds like I'm not really all that enthused about the plot line it's because I'm not. There was really nothing that was too terribly original about the storyline. In fact, if you look at the trailers, you'd think this movie was based on the video game `Need for Speed'. The colors used and the cars involved could have easily come out of that game and the characters? Definitely could have been taken out of a video game. The writing was full of clichés and the delivery of them wasn't overly well done. At some points I thought to myself `Did he actually say that?? That's so cheesy!' or `Please don't say that next line, please, please, please!' but they did. Not enough time was spent on developing the relationships we see. We're just kind of told about them but not in a way that really enlightens us, just that this relationship exists so accept it. So far this review is sounding pretty negative isn't it? Well, I have to say that the stunts were kind of interesting. The car chase scenes (and there's a lot of them) were pretty well done and some of the scenes they do with the semi-trucks were interesting but not all that believable.
So you're wondering, is there anything worth seeing about this movie? Hmmm, maybe depending on if you fit that target group I was talking about. If you have a hot car and like to see some hot cars with neat toys and some street racing, then this movie's for you. Other than that, I wouldn't really see it. The dialogue alone would make you want to get pulled over for road rage.",The Fast and the Furious
217,SwingBatta,"Fast cars, furious action, comatose plot",3,27 February 2002,"""The Fast and The Furious,"" directed by Rob Cohen and based on a magazine article about street racing, was undoubtedly one of the ""in"" movies during the summer of 2001, grossing over $140 million.To label it a ""surprise hit"" was erroneous. ""Furious"" was going to succeed no matter what, because, to put it bluntly, it was a dual-gratification film. The girls were aroused at its pretty-boy hunk stars, and the guys likewise at the four-wheeled penile extensions  I mean the gaudy, overgarnished import cars.And after finally seeing it almost a year later, I wholeheartedly agree that it was ""in,"" all right: inept, inane, insipid, and inferior.The plot has undercover cop Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker) infiltrating a street-racing gang suspected of stealing and fencing electronic equipment. They spend the money on modifications to their rice burners, such as blowing $10,000 on speed-increasing nitrous oxide tanks. As Brian is accepted into the criminal fraternity by the gang leader, Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel), he also finds himself falling for Dom's sister, Mia (Jordana Brewster). Sure enough  you guessed it  Brian is increasingly hesitant to apprehend Dom for the thefts as their friendship grows over time. It sounds just as bad as it plays.I knew the script for ""Furious"" would be embarrassing, considering that it plays second banana to moving hunks of glass and steel, and I wasn't disappointed. I've read better dialogue on a cereal box. I mean, how can you beat lines like ""Damn, that guy's fast!"" and ""Hey, bro, you got a bathroom?""It's obvious the male leads were cast for their looks. Beach bum-looking Walker is hardly believable as a police officer or a street racer. Most of his close-ups show him staring at his co-stars with a blank half-grin. His attempt at sounding cool consists of, ""Check it out, it's like this."" If he wins the film's opening race, then he'll ""get the money and the respect."" (A telltale sign that he's a cop: he's the only driver in the entire movie who bothers to wear a seatbelt.)I must've been on another planet when it was decided that Diesel was the next big star in the making. Whatever the case may be, his popularity certainly isn't due to his acting. Here, he is emotionless when speaking lines that don't require him to scream, and as a result he sounds like he's reading off a teleprompter. He is victimized by poor dialogue as much as Walker; at one point, when Dom wistfully says to Brian, ""I live my life a quarter mile at a time,"" I wanted to spray the screen with Airwick.Early in the film, Dom and his buddies refer to Brian as ""the buster."" Does anyone even use that term anymore?Incredibly enough, both Walker and Diesel are outdone by Michelle Rodriguez in her unintentionally hysterical role of Dom's girlfriend. She performs the most grueling duty of the picture: standing around for ninety minutes with a permanent pout on her face. Then again, if I had lines like ""Why don't you skate before I leave treadmarks on your face?"" my lower lip would be protruding like a diving platform.Save for Brewster as Mia, the script prevents viewers from sympathizing with the poorly developed characters. As a result, any expressions of sentimentality come off as artificial. We don't feel sorry for characters who get shot at while stuck on an 18-wheeler, suffer a horrific car crash, or are gunned down in a drive-by shooting.The other type of race figures prominently in ""Furious,"" and the script gives it the finger by playing up stereotypes to the hilt. All the Mexican men wear khaki shorts and tall socks; one cracks racist jokes and ""has a last name but can't pronounce it."" Dom and Brian are harassed by motorcycle-riding, machine gun-toting Asians led by Johnny Tran (Rick Yune). Meanwhile, the Black crowd is so well-represented by Ja Rule in a spellbinding performance. (If you couldn't sense the sarcasm here, then you shouldn't be reading this.) When he talks, he sounds like he needs a Breathe-Right strip. Not surprisingly, he is the source of the film's only ""F"" word during his mercifully brief screen time.Big shock  the women are portrayed as nothing more than scantily-clad armpieces in short skirts. Their sole purpose is to stand around while the cameras pan up from their ankles. The extras at the first race all cheer and jeer right on cue like Pavlov's dogs as Dom rambles about car parts. Perhaps they were amazed at his usage of big words.However, not everything is the fault of the actors. Much of ""Furious"" is just outright nonsense.For starters, I've hardly ever seen any cars that are covered in all those psychedelic graphics. The race and chase sequences suffer greatly at the hands of a combination of choppy editing and an overbearing rap soundtrack. Plus, what part of Los Angeles is deserted both day and night, and where does such a huge stretch of road exist on which four cars can race side-by-side while going over 140 miles an hour (that's over two miles per minute; I doubt that nearly eight miles of a city street can be illegally blocked off by spectators)? Are there always so many lead changes in such a short race? How can the characters afford these cars? Can someone go flipping and flying about in a '69 Charger, crash and then walk away with barely a scratch? How can Brian burn out his engine after hitting 140 and then drive away an instant later, or take his eyes off the road for long stretches of time during a race in order to operate not one, but two laptop computers?If I was a cop who was incompetent enough to let my prime suspect get away (""I owe you a ten-second car,"" Brian tells Dom before forking over the keys), my career would soon be in cinders after I was terminated for assisting in a criminal's escape.""The Fast and The Furious"" would have fared better had the script been as eye-popping as the cars.

I had no trouble understanding why our cop hero, himself once in trouble with the law, slowly gravitated away from his chilly bosses and toward the vitality and warmth of the street racers' family unit, with its backyard picnics, protection of weaker members and strong internal loyalty.

227,tripper0,if only they didn't speak....,5,26 September 2001,"'The Fast and the Furious' is good when it is both fast and furious.  The problem with the film lies in between.  Well, actually the problem with the film is any time an actor opens their mouth and spouts out some sort of inane dialogue.  Paul Walker delivers his lines with the same deadpan, almost non acting approach that has made Keanu Reeves famous.  His voice sounds the same too.  If I had closed my eyes I would have sworn it was Keanu. I was just waiting for him to spout out the words ""Whoa"" or ""Dude"". No such luck however.  Vin Diesel was disappointing as well.  At least acting wise that is.  He does fill in his role well, as he has the right look.  The acting and directing, still, are both horrible.  The parts of the movie with dialogue are horrible.  The parts of the movie with the cars, however, are not.This movie has the absolute best, most high octane and exciting car racing(and chasing)scenes I have ever seen in my life.  The movie excels on this level.  It is a great adrenaline rush just watching it.  I wish the movie was silent with a lot of the car scenes because then we would have had a great action movie.  Unfortunately they bogged it all down by trying to incorporate a plot(a bad one I might add), your standard romances, and you standard double crosses.  It excels on one level, but on the level that makes a movie great, it completely flounders.  It is worth watching to see the car races, especially if you like that sort of thing.

229,MissCzarChasm,The Ultimate Summer Movie,10,23 June 2001,"I just back from seeing The Fast and the Furious and i have to say i have never been so pumped after seeing a film. Keep in mind from the moment i saw the trailer for this film i wanted desperately to see it. It had fast cars, Fast girls, and it guaranteed some pretty cool action sequences. Needless to say that i wasn't disappointed and this has made my list of best movie of the summer so far.The plot in this film is pretty basic. A undercover cop named Brian(Paul Walker) is sent to get the inside scoop on a group of street racers who may or may not be smuggling equipment from pick-up trucks. The street racing team is lead by Dom(Vin Diesel). Brian however begins to fall for Dom's sister Mia(Jordana Brewster) and things begin to become truly complicated.Why is this the ultimate summer movie? You can go into this film with no expectations and be truly entertained. It's mindless fun so to speak and it's a good way to spend 90 minutes. I enjoyed every minute of this film and as the title promises there is a lot of Furious action.The racing sequences are done really well and are the best i've seen in a long while. There are some good camera shots and camera angles and these shots make the races even more exhilarating. The best sequence has to be towards to end that involves cars and one big pick-up truck.The acting is also pretty good. Vin Diesel is going to be huge. He is a very commanding performer and he alone carries this film acting wise. The same can not be said for Paul Walker who is very flat. I said this before in my review of the skulls the guy needs some lessons stat. The girls are really good in the film. Jordana brewster displays the sensitvity and sensuality that is needed to portray her character and Michelle Rodriguez as dom's girlfriend letty is just one big ball of sass. i loved this character and i wish she could've been in the film more.All in all a good summer movie. i'm sure you won't be disappointed.",The Fast and the Furious

Like motorcycle gang cliche movies from the 50's, you see.(Spoilers abound ahead)How about this one: the blame for the crimes is shifted to an Asian guy, who is arrested at his family home during a meal. Instead of being angry with the cops, the father slaps his son. Good scene. Anyway, in spite of the fact that this guy machine gunned a police undercover vehicle which we are told cost $80,000, destroying it completely, he can't be held because all they have is ""minor weapons violations"". Right.Ok - I had a stopwatch and timed the ""10 second race"" at one minute 51 seconds. Now, this is about par for the quarter mile times of a REAL Honda, but apparently these ones are heavily modified, so you'd expect them to at least be in the under-a-minute range, right?It amazes me that someone can blow up his motor, destroying rings according to one character, and yet drive away with no smoke AND elude cops with the exact same car just seconds later. I wish MY car would self-repair like that, it would save me a lot of hassles and scuffed fingers.The only thing I can say is, if you feel that you want to immerse yourself in a fantasy world that has very little basis in reality, where cars auto-repair and quarter mile races last almost two minutes, and cops let their quarry escape, and truck drivers don't get out of their trucks to check on the guy that just totalled his car on the truck, well, go right on ahead.Afterward, go slap a giant exhaust tip and goofy spoiler on your ugly little tin box import, then come race me at a track. This movie will not prepare you for the realities of street racing OR life in general.I rate this movie as a 2, only because of the strangely compelling performance of Ja-Rule and because the cinematography was pretty good. Otherwise it deserved a zero.",The Fast and the Furious

It is just a miss match that is so obvious the director ignores until the end of the film.  The acting of Pawl Walker as Brian O'Conner and Vin Diesel as Domminic Toretto are not bad.  There are few difficult scenes that will make you wince but overall it is workable.  The chase scenes are generally good but the opening scenes is painful to watch.

So give him respect!!!

But it will do enough to keep you entertained through out, thanks to it's excellent cast and furious race scenes. The film was a good idea and it could have not been executed any better then it was. The not so familiar director Rob Cohen did a very good job. Most scenes were well panned out and ribbon tied with it's cool racing or just brilliant acting. For that it really does deserve 9 stars.The major impact this movie had was it's pride. The fast and the furious did not get too a head of them selves and also didn't have the biggest budget to work with. But the movie reflects on a job well done. The movie is just simple plain fun, it take you for a enjoyable ride. The racing scenes were well though out, intense and very fun to watch. Some scenes were all the friends are together were witty and fun to watch too. The script was nothing major but decent. The acting was the brilliant, Vin Diesel knew and played his role very well, his role had the major impact. The plot was interesting but nothing real special. Overall the movie was very enjoyable, great racing, cool cars with a touch of action and humour.",The Fast and the Furious
241,Extraordinary_Machine,"The saving grace of 'The Fast and the Furious' are the highly charged racing sequences, but even those are punctured by Rob Cohen's berserk direction",4,7 March 2005,"The Fast and the Furious Every week, trucks containing valuable electronic equipment are hijacked by the expert drivers of super-fast, unmarked cars. In their investigation, the FBI and the Los Angeles police force begin to suspect participants in the vicious, illegal nighttime street-racing wars of committing the crimes. The almost cult-like following that this activity attracts is led by Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel, 'Pitch Black'), whose more sensible sister Mia (Jordana Brewster, 'The Faculty') is beginning to fall for Brian O'Connor (Paul Walker, 'She's All That'), a new face in the street-racing circuit. But, unbeknownst to Mia or Dominic and his entourage, Brian is an undercover cop who has been assigned to infiltrate their group and try to discover the culprit behind the thefts. But as Brian spends more and more time with the Torettos and their companions, he finds himself torn between his duty as a police officer, and his loyalty as a friend.Aside from the fact that 'The Fast and the Furious' is based on a Vibe magazine article about street-racing written by Ken Li, the script isn't anything special, and seems more heavily inspired by the mediocre Jerry Bruckheimer-produced 'Gone in Sixty Seconds' remake from last year, as well as a 1999 Hong Kong action film, 'The Legend of Speed'. I can forgive the lack of brains presented here, but some actual characters would have been nice, as would capable actors to fill their shoes. Paul Walker does not convince in the lead role, and fails to truly express the emotional byproducts of his character's internal conflict of interests, while Vin Diesel is all too content to let his muscles do the talking. Michelle Rodriguez, as Diesel's moody love interest, is the bright spark within the tedium, but it seems as if she wandered onto the set while filming 'Girlfight' and was instantly hired on the spot. For a mainstream breakthrough, this gifted actress deserved better.The saving grace of 'The Fast and the Furious' are the highly charged racing sequences, but even those are punctured by Rob Cohen's berserk direction.

Paul Walker plays an undercover detective who is investigating a group of people who street race, they are also suspected of hijacking trucks of valuable merchandise. He becomes friends with Vin Diesel's character...and his little sister, played by the beautiful Jordanna Brewster. The action scenes are pretty cool, I didn't know much about suped up cars, nor did I care about them. I still don't. But it was fun to see how fast they went. The acting is superb, with the exception of Paul Walker. He was the least interesting character. Diesel was good. Michelle Rodrigez who plays Diesel's girlfriend is spunky and has attitude. She's a fine little actress and is going places. As is Brewster, she is just lovely and gave a pretty good performance. They're making a sequel and only Walker is returning. None of the good characters will be back. So will I see it? Two words. Eva Mendes. She is the only reason I'll be in that theater. As for this movie, it's a fast paced adrenaline rush. It's an action movie with good characterzation. That's rare these days. So if you were pondering checking this movie out, you don't have to be a car fan to do it.

246,CinemaCocoa,"It is a neat, nitrous oxide powered glamour film",8,13 April 2017,"The surprisingly humble beginnings (by comparison) of what is now a six film series, The Fast and the Furious was a hit for bringing a new lease of life to the racing film.An undercover cop, Brian O'Conner, must discover who is to blame for goods trucks being hi-jacked and stolen by drivers in high performance street cars. He puts himself into the urban culture of street racing where he meets Dominic Toretto and his team. Brian falls for Dominic's sister, Mia, in the process and threatens his investigation and his life.The film is quite a brainless piece of entertainment, its story is predictable, it follows an undercover cop who starts to sympathize with his targets, and the characters are written spontaneously to fit the demands of the plot. You gotta love the opening dialogue: ""I like the tuna here,"" ""Nobody likes the tuna here!"" Plus, Paul Walker really is a bland actor.But, that isn't why we watch the film. The Fast and the Furious does have some great car racing scenes and director Rob Cohen can shoot the cars and make them look great. What is most appealing is the physicality of the stunts and the racing; there's no CGI tomfoolery here, and there is a simplicity about the film that makes it worth watching. You don't need to suspend your disbelief, the plot doesn't shovel many excuses for racing into your face.It is a neat, nitrous oxide powered glamour film.

The makers of this flick took the plot of Point Break and used cars instead of skydiving and surfboards. Let's see -- instead of Keanu Reeves (the worst actor of all time, BTW) as an undercover FBI agent we have Paul Walker as an undercover cop. Instead of Patrick Swayze as the cold guru who takes the undercover FBI agent under his wing we have Vin Diesel as the cold guru who takes in the undercover cop under his wing. Instead of the ex-girlfriend of the guru falling for the undercover cop it's the younger sister of the guru falling for the undercover FBI agent. Instead of an ending in Australia it's in Mexico. Instead of robbing banks they rob trucks. Pathetic. I can't believe how many people actually liked this lameexcuse for a film. Gee... fast cars... too bad there are only 3 races scenes in the entire movie -- TOTAL. Nevermind that one of them is between the Japanese guy and the clueless fool of a friend.Lame, lame, lame.

Had a nice little preview with fast cars and well, fast cars. I think it came out shortly after Gone in 60 Seconds. Which was a good movie. This one is, well, a movie. Your call as to whether it's good or not.Brian O'Connor (Walker) is an undercover cop who poses as a street racer. His assignment right now is to watch Dom (Diesel), who is the main suspect in a high-tech ring of highway robberies. We don't know who the bad guys are in this movie for a while, but eventually we find out that it is in fact Dom and his crew doing the highway robberies. If you haven't seen it and I spoiled it for you, my apologies. Hopefully that'll keep you from watching it now.I don't think the plot goes much deeper than that which I have just mentioned. This movie is about two things. The babes, and the cars. There's quite a few of each that are very good looking. For the most part the cars are better in this one though.I'm not really sure what else to write in this review. That's how much the plot is weak sauce. I mean, Vin Diesel and Paul Walker have to hold this movie on their shoulders. And who do they get for backup? Ja Rule. Good grief people. Couldn't we find one decent actor? Guess not. Really, if you ever bother watching this movie, realize right from square one that this movie is not about the plot or the acting. It's about the big zoom zoom that the cars make.

Come on, this is so bad it makes the first Rugrats Movie and Lilo and Stitch look like Lord of the Rings and The Spy Who Loved Me. I know I'm not the type for this kind of movie, but that's not going to let it off the hook. This film is loaded with despicable one-liners and a horrible soundtrack. I don't even know the plot. It's just about a bunch of racers in L.A., and one of them is an undercover cop who's looking for a bunch of hijackers or something like that. It's nothing to take you away. Oh, and starting the movie with two guys arguing about a tuna sandwich? Ooh, that's genius.
Even if that wasn't enough, the cast sucks, plain and simple. Rick Yune delivered a very good performance, but the performances of Paul Walker, Jordana Brewster, Michelle Rodriguez, and Vin Diesel (Blech) are pretty bad. This film is nothing but a bunch of street homies showing off their sports cars to impress a bunch of stupid girls. In fact, the title of this movie should be something like ""Raging Hormones"". There are its good points though. The effects of day changing to night are cool, the settings of L.A. for the first 20 minutes or so are pretty good, and the race scene is captivating. But most of the other action is pretty lame. There is some stuff to grab you, but nothing to entertain you. I can't believe I stayed up until midnight watching this when I could have been doing something more fun, like dusting mothballs off my clothes or washing dishes.

Vin Diesel was brilliant as Dominic not to mention on the top of my sexiest guys list!

263,sn319,Underwhelming from Beginning to End,3,6 December 2014,"Set in Los Angeles, The Fast and the Furious follows Paul Walker's character, an up-and-coming street racer whose cocky antics land him in a race he loses. After saving Dom (Vin Diesel), who is in charge of a small group of racers and owns a garage, the two become good friends. Paul Walker is actually an undercover cop trying to get evidence against these racers as many of them attack trucks on highways and steal their cargo.What sounds like an exciting plot is ruined by lackluster pacing and, at least for me, a lack of excitement. Cars, guns, tits, a pointless shot of two girls kissing, beer. It's all the kind of things that fourteen year old boys tend to masturbate too. And that's not to say the film is childish (which, let's face it, it kind of is) but it is built to appeal to a crowd that I don't belong to. The actual racing of the film is drag racing, which does not translate to exciting pieces of action. Driving in a straight line toward a finish line and pressing a button for nitro is not fun to watch and I felt the opening drag race between Walker and Diesel had some pretty poor directing. It looked obviously sped up and I can understand it was done that way to actually allow us to see the cars, but it looks pretty stupid.As far as characters go Brian O' Conner (Walker) is as boring as they get. The romance between himself and Dom's sister could be interesting for character interactions if the characters themselves were worth anything. Dom himself is cool if only because he's supposed to be. You can easily dismiss every character here as none are truly worth remembering.And then there is the pacing I mentioned before. It starts off moving at a decent clip but slows dramatically in the middle. The final twenty minutes are a mishmash of endings with a climactic scene on the highway followed by a climactic chase through the streets of LA and finalized with a climactic (and pretty pointless) scene of drag racing. There are some loose ends that needed to be tied by the end, but it's done pretty poorly and doesn't feel organic. It just feels like the writer wanted to jump from here to here to here with nothing to lead to that next scene.The Fast and the Furious is pretty dumb and juvenile, with really nothing to offer aside from a few sweet cars.

The actors really studied and embraced their role to a point where we can feel their emotions and identify ourselves with some of them.

266,Krog__,Funniest Movie of 2001,3,11 August 2003,"This was the funniest movie of 2001! This is the epitamy of ""dumb humor"". It spoofs such movies as Point Break with its incredibly stupid lines, horribly horrible acting, and 3-minute racing scenes for what should take about 10 seconds. Paul Walker is the worst actor ever to have stumbled his way into the big-screen and that's what really made the movie work. Vin Diesel, a decent actor, chooses the comedy gem that brought him to mainstream humor venues and later got him into the less-funny XXX. I reccommend it for everyone with a sense of humor who can laugh at things like this.That said, this was complete sh*t. Zoolander, I believe, was the funniest movie of 2001 if I remember correctly, and this was the dumbest. Avoid unless you want something to laugh at for its stupidity. If you take it serious, 0/10. If you don't take it serious, 6/10.",The Fast and the Furious
267,paulsrobinson,A good fast paced action film,7,21 May 2013,"To go in and watch The Fast and Furious, it is a lesson in expectations as it is obviously not a masterpiece, and you should not expect it to be either. it does exactly what it says on the poster though and the film is fast and the action is furious.The story of Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker) who is a undercover police officer. Trying to breaking on to the Street racing scene. Through Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) so he can bring down a crew who are hijacking trucks. The thing with the film is that in a lot of ways it is terrible. I'm not a Rob Cohen fan, of all his films this is probably the best of his work in my opinion and only challenged by 1996's Dragonheart. In acting terms Paul Walker is a good looking guy but lacks real acting talent and charisma on screen. Vin Diesel though does have good screen presence, and at times I think is an underrated actor. The supporting cast is generally OK except for the insufferable and thankfully only in it for a short period Ja Rule, and the definitely not very intimidating Reggie Lee as the main protagonists henchmen.What is surprising and actually good about the film is that it does have a nice simple plot and develops the characters as we get to know about Dom's father and his childhood, and see Mia Toretto (Jordana Brewster) and Brian fall in love. The Car chases are decent and again are practical effects, which are better than CGI Green screen chases uses in some of the sequels. Praise also has to made of the final sequences involving the final hijacking, the chasing of some drive by shooters and the final race off. which were very thrilling and kept you on the edge of your seat until the end.I can't say i love this film, because i don't. But i did like it and enjoyed the ride while it lasted.",The Fast and the Furious

Paul Walker was just starting his career and was a little rough and Vin Diesel gives his usual grunts and groans performance. The movie is loud, but what would you expect from this type of film. It basically proves that fast cars, and fast women equal fun.In this film you have teenagers around 16-19 who have high performance cars, but give you the impression that they couldn't screw in a light bulb without help, and somehow in the film the police are nowhere to be found despite the roar of 800 horsepower engines.A minor diversion, but a movie that makes no sense.(*1/2) Out Of (****)",The Fast and the Furious

271,camachoborracho,"Ignore the haters, better than you'd expect",6,24 November 2004,"I admit I was skeptical about watching this movie before viewing it since the preview made it look like a shallow action film for teens with no substance whatsoever...and then there's Vin Diesel (and Ja Rule). But came away with a feeling of, well, not quite satisfaction, but definitely not discomfort as the haters (aka Internet movie nerds and ""critics"") bring forth in their reviews. Sure there is action, explosions, chases, hot chicks, etc. but that's to be expected from a film called ""The Fast and the Furious."" Indeed, it is fast with its MTV style editing with furious undertones of rage and violence and crime, but hey, it's a movie about criminal car racers for crying out loud.Yes the visuals are impressive and the sound is good too. The editing, lighting, cinematography and all the other technicals are well done. The acting...not so well done but not awful - there really isn't a whole lot, nor dialogue for that matter. But what makes the story compelling is its (simple yes, but intriguing nevertheless) character relationships which form the plot.Is this film over the top? Yes. But it is done in such a way that keeps you interested, and besides, since so few of us actually do know about the undercover world of streetcar racing, who are we to say what is real and what isn't? Besides, if you haven't been paying attention, this film is a male fantasy - muscles, guns, money, cars, women...like every other video on MTV (which explains the annoying soundtrack).This film is not a great movie, but it has no pretense of being one, and that is refreshing when so much crap out there does. It is a popcorn flick, instantly forgettable but watchable over and over nonetheless. Plus, watch the DVD extras as to how some impressive stunts were done, and your appreciation for this film will grow.OVERALL RATING: 6 of 10 stars. It won't hurt to watch this one, just remember to suspend your disbelief (you should anyway - it's a movie!)",The Fast and the Furious
272,nivek_nailgun,good...but we've seen it already,7,28 November 2001,"I really thought I'd hate this movie but it wasn't at all bad. In fact, I really enjoyed it a lot more than I thought I was going to. Exciting racing,nice cars and not a bad story...buuuuuuut; it's already been done. The story is so close to Point Break that the writers HAD to have noticed it. Point Break is the better of the two,but I still recommend this one. Now for the other bad stuff....(I'd put this under the goofs section,but it's not available yet). 1- The first streetrace we see lasts far longer than a quarter mile race does,which is NEVER over 20 seconds (unless your car is really really slow or broken). Well,this first race was (roughly) 2 minutes in duration. I know it makes for better action,but it's unreasonable all the same. 2- I don't care how powerful your car is. In the final scene of the movie,Dom does a wheelstand WITHOUT doing a burnout (heats the tires for traction) this is impossible (although great eye candy,the car would do nothing but sit there and spin) and 3- Final scene again. Dom's car apparantly was a 9 second vehicle vs the 10 second import and the race ended neck and neck. There is no way they would end that close if the cars truly ran what they said they did. A full second in a race is a huge gap. If there were a couple of tenths difference,that would be different..but a FULL second? That being said....it was a pretty good movie anyway. 7/10",The Fast and the Furious

I happen to be one of the ones who loved it, I unlike the reviewer who's review was the first one shown as I right this thought the dialog was written fine, vin diesel is a good actor, and that a large amount of this movie's apeal is in how the car scenes are shot. In alot of movies, when they try to throw cars into the mix, you get bored, the shots are too centered, it gets boring, everytime they race the cars here, the screen shakes and gives me (and anybody else who loved this movie) an awesum rush.

I went to see ""The Fast and the Furious"" with low expectations and was pleasantly surprised.  It was a magnificent movie with unquestionably fantastic special effects and stunning realism.  True if you are an actual street racer, you may see a few flaws in the realism (as happens with any movie about any non-publicized culture), but for the rest of us, it is a much needed improvement on movies like ""Gone in 60 Seconds"" (I still hate that part where Nick Cage outruns the helicopter).There is truth to the statement that this movie is very similar to ""Point Break"", though I did not notice it until it was pointed out in this site.

It's not about pleasing people, or if so, that is just a small part of it.  If this movie was rated R, the viewers would be restricted to just adults, and it is in many ways the perfect movie for the teen/young adults.  Just like if ""Eyes Wide Shut"" was NC-17: if this was rated R, a lot of potential money would have been lost. The only difference is that ""Eyes Wide Shut"" sucked badly, and needed extra nudity to help us men forget about the plot and direction, whereas this movie was still pretty good.  And people still see R movies.  Most theatres don't even show NC-17 movies.  I suppose there's nothing you can do about censorship except hate mail the MPAA, whom are really just trying to please the soccer moms and republicans of America.But, yeah, I want to see this movie again.

And perform they do. All the driving stuff is pretty fun in a campy sort of way; I especially like the way the different cars tend to drive in some sort of formation, as if they were the Blue Angels or something.

When Sean was introduced into the gang there where females who wanted to be males. The only racing Girl of course had a barby colored car.
It made me cringe everytime they switched from on Driver to another everytime trying to get out a cool setence like: you're next. I´'ll Show you what I got. Eat my dust, Boy.
I can only guess they financed all those expensive cars and stuff because of the product Placement.
Als the animations made us snort into our drínks when they hit the red button on the driving wheel. Everyone always got smashed in their seats but so badly I was reminded of the early star trek series when the actors shook themselves instead of the camera when they where hit by a Meteor shower.
The safety precautions came quite short in the movie. I haven't seen any seatbelts, or safety clothing. Even when they crashed, nobody got hurt.I had to admitt It often looked like, it's ok to take risks in driving. Nothing will hapen, no one gets hurt or arrested.

This film is 106 minutes long and the budget was 38,000,000 $.The film is about a man named Dominic Toretto who organized illicit games with customed cars in the streets of Los Angeles with his team, they earn money by stealing illicit gasoline and an agent of the C.I.A. (Bryan O'Conner) who investigates these robberies and who tries to befriend this group.Honetly, this film is short but the budget of this movie is cheap compared to the budget of Harry Potter and Fast and Furious is as good as Harry Potter.This film is really action-packed and breath-taking.
The topic of the movie is thought-provoking because they speak of illegal race cars af is it was normal, it's very funny and cool but it's so dangerous.The visual effects are extremely beatiful because it's real stunts and there aren't special effects because the explosions, the flames and the rest are real.The sound designer is cool because the songs in this film are rap and rock and I love it.It's the film I have seen the most (17 times)And last but not least, the cars are very beautiful and customed, for the die-hard fans of cars, it's the film that you must see.

There are definitely many people who consider fast cars young chicks, adrenaline and all that other stuff around extremely cool. And this is a movie for them. Virtual reality, something that WOULD NOT HAPPEN IN REAL LIFE. The movie accomplished this task, no doubt about it. If you are in a target group - I would say that would be mostly men under 25 - you will probably like it. Fast cars, lot of racing scenes, dynamic music, clipish cinematography, easy-on-the-eyes chicks -  nothing important is missing.

Instead I'm going to list just a few thing that are wrong about the cars in the movie, which I'm guessing was designed for viewers who largely have no clue about cars, maybe because the target audience is slightly too young to drive, i.e. early teens? Well, here goes: 1. NOS seems to be the solution to everything. There is a lot more involved to make a car go fast, yet the shop is full of NOS, NOS, and more NOS parts! Oh, and exhausts, because everyone knows loud exhausts are the 2nd most important thing that makes a car go fast ;-) 2. The car ""tops out at 140"", let's add some NOS (surprise!) and it'll go faster. If your car tops out at 140, NOS will not help you one bit. Maybe you're running out of gears, maybe the engine should be built for higher revs, but NOS won't change anything about your top speed! 3. The best qualities of the type of cars driven, modern Japanese cars, are cornering and handling. What do they do? They have a drag race on a straight instead - wrong car for this purpose, any average US muscle car will beat the hell out of the Jappa there with less money spent on it (and conversely, a modern Japanese car will leave an average old US muscle car in the dust in an actual race involving lots of corners).4. Double-clutching ... oh dear, what a complete and utter nonsense! You double-clutch if you have an unsynchronized transmission - very unlikely - and even then only when you down-shift (which you never do in a drag race!) 5. 140mph is fast at the end of a quarter mile, but not that fast in principle, there are *many* European and Japanese cars that have a top speed around that figure or higher, even ""family cars"".6. Nitrous oxide doesn't run out after a few seconds (lines in the movie indicate a racer has used his NOS boost ""too early"").7. If Vin is serious about drag racing, he wouldn't have a sound system weighing a ton in his car. Note, there's a scene where the geek is explaining how to save 2-3kg of weight on the car they're building later on, so on the other hand they do seem to be interested in saving weight.8. Towards the end, Vin drives the Charger and does a monstrous wheelie. You don't get that kind of traction/wheelie on anything but big fat racing slicks, yet the car has pretty normal tires on it.9. While we're at it - the tires are smoking while he does a wheelie?! Wheelie means you have grip. Smoking tires means you don't have grip. Which is it?!? 10. A car like that Charger would definitely have a wheelie bar, especially since a wheelie as big and exaggerated as the one shown in the movie would just cost you time.11. If you're serious about 1/4 mile times, you're not going to drive a FWD car, but rather a RWD or 4WD car.12. Surely even the boy-racer scene with Jappa cars finds cheap stickers tacky (no pun intended) and would opt for real airbrush or pin-striping on their prized cars (there is one scene where they put decorative stickers(!) on a car).13. Why would you rebuild a burnt out Supra?! Apparently their labor is free and restoring the car is done in a leisurely afternoon or something. Oh, and the engine is so special that $15k turns it into a 10s car! These are just off the top of my head, and I'm not even that knowledgeable about cars myself, so I'm sure there's plenty more wrong. The movie doesn't pretend to be anything it isn't, but at least they should have gotten the ""car"" parts right in what is meant to be a car movie! ...or did I get that wrong and I just watched a very long commercial for NOS (which is a brand name ;-) ?",The Fast and the Furious
298,Abusimble1,Stupid Movie Splattered with Feminist Propaganda,1,24 October 2007,"Horrible movie! Why is that everything coming out of Hollyweird has two major problems? One, the women are made to act like men. They dress more shabbily than the male characters, they have more physical strength than the male characters, they have more scientific aptitude than the male characters, they display more willpower than the male characters. The public seems to feed off this perverted view of modern women. Two, the plot in these movies is a joke. What's so difficult about making a normal movie that takes some brains to follow? All these films have explosions, more explosions, and then some more explosions. The style of filming is also becoming darker, more syncopated, especially the fight scenes.

299,mattdvs,Completely forgettable entertainment,6,31 July 2001,"I waited a pretty long time before seeing this movie because I didn't want to deal with the rice rocket rallies during the first few weekends.  I knew, just from the previews, that it would attract a large audience, no matter whether it was actually a decent film or not.  After seeing it, I have to admit, once I turned off the analytical part of my brain, I enjoyed it. While it's definitely true that the screenplay was trite and predictable and most of the actors were seemingly hired based on looks rather than talent, this film was saved by a few things.  The most obvious of this film's saviors was the outstanding camera work during the films many chase/race sequences.  Also, Vin Diesel has a magnetic charisma that makes his even his non-racing scene watchable.  A few of the other actors, in particular Michelle Rodriguez, turn in passable performances too, although I'm definitely not impressed by pretty boy Paul Walker, who phones in a typical and contrived performance.  Overall, if, like me, you're able to turn off the part of your brain that wants you to scream ""Who talks like that???"", then you'll probably find this an enjoyable film, if forgettable, film. 3/5",The Fast and the Furious

What makes me love this film above all the others? Well, there's a few things:This is the original, the best! Before Hollywood took it and threw into unrealistic scenarios and laughable over the top action sequences.This movie at its core is about friendship and the close bonds the main characters hold for one another. Lengths a person will go to for those they love.It keeps things simple, street racing, robbery, fist fights and racial feuds. Why do audiences need cars jumping from high rise to high rise and over the top villains with pointless back stories and agenda's?It's realistic (to a degree) has impressive actor chemistry, makes you care for the characters and their close bonds. Fun storyline, high stress action sequences. You really don't need more to create a great film, if written and executed correctly.On a side note I will say, at this time of his career, Paul Walker, cannot act. Thankfully he improved on his talents as he worked in the series more and more. Which is more than you can say for a lot of ""pretty"" men landing high profile film roles in the industry today.10/10 loved it 18years ago and love it still. You cannot beat the classic, the original The Fast & The Furious.",The Fast and the Furious
304,purban,Too Offensive to be Fun...,1,3 July 2001,"I'm all for sex, drugs and rock and roll...and fast cars too.  Movies like that can be a lot of fun.  But this film left me rather disturbed.Perhaps some vague spoilers ahead, so be warned...The multi-ethnic casting seems at first like a breath of fresh air, until one realizes that it pretty much boils down to everyone vs. the Asians.  And who dies in the film?  Criminals?  Well...only if they're Asian.The film uses women as eye-candy.  Male racers are rewarded with babes and sex--if they win.  If they loose, well, maybe they'll be called ""faggot""--and they won't get to sleep with the babe, because no woman in the film is debasing enough to sleep with a loser.  Michelle Rodriguez tries to be the exception to this image, but in acting tough she has a permanent scowl on her face and merely comes off as being very, very unhappy.  I don't think she smiled once in the film.The film blurs the line between good and evil (except for the Asians--they're evil) and has no sense of closure or justice.  Top it all off with a few plot holes (why didn't they use the cell-phone trick in the beginning?) and you have a movie that tries to be fun but is actually ridiculous and offensive.  The only good thing about the film is that it's making a ton of money--not good in itself, but at least it means we'll see Vin Diesel around more often.

Plastic characters. Flat performances. Amazingly predictable story line. Empty script... Finally I felt myself pushed into adding this line just to fill the minimum. There is really very little that can be added to this movie. And it's quite difficult to find word that define the rage any serious movie-lover feels at seeing this junk being released.

To be honest, I have no idea if street racing is an Asian-American thing, but if my son is right, then this movie becomes the Saturday Night Fever of its day, Fever also being a movie based on a magazine article, where the subculture in question (in SNF's case, gay disco) is homogenized for mainstream consumption (goodbye, gay disco boys or Asian speed fanatics, hello Italian-Americans and Vin Diesel, who may be of unknown ethnicity but who is probably not of Asian descent).

Ever since I can remember, I've been into cars. Always have, always will be. Now, when Hollywood tries to make a film about car culture, did they get it right? Sort of.
This movie has so much good about it. The story is just solid. Car guys and girls just being themselves, sticking together. Lets you know a bit of what its like to have a crew. All the cars are iconic. Dom's Black Dodge Charger and Red Mazda RX-7, Brian's Orange Toyota Supra and Green Mitsubishi Eclipse. So many other cars that back in the day and even today look absurd with the styling and parts, but are classics because of the movies that made them. And this movie started all of it. You can't talk about tuner culture or drag racing or even Paul Walker without bringing this film up. This film had its rough spots, but those imperfections are what make this film so iconic and loved.
So, did Hollywood make a car film true to the culture? It's 50/50. They got the racing and the tuning and the whole feel of the scene, but also added in the heists and back turning that is so classic Hollywood. This film is classic, and still means something to me today.",The Fast and the Furious

The characters are not developed at all.  One would think that a movie of this ilk would try to explain the racers' motivation, history, basically why they are so fixated on hot-rodding Japanese cars that were intended to be reliable, overpriced, boring transportation for young women (i.e., Honda Civics).Furthermore, to my recollection nearly all the cars raced were front-drivers, making the film's ""Holy Grail"" of a ten second quarter mile ludicrous.

Of course, ""Point Break"" actually went through the bother of explaining Keanu Reeves motivation.

Did he simply love the smell of new cars, and who doesn't!?!  In any event, his motivation, and several other things are left to the audiences imagination.So is this a terrible movie?  No, not really.  Plot deficiencies aside, the racing scenes are really quite well done.  On many occasions the camera moves inside the engine, and we are able to see and hear the pistons roar!

332,mikerichards,"Point Break 2 : Less surfing, more cars",6,17 September 2001,"This is an 'okay' film, the acting is 'okay', the script is 'okay', the direction is 'okay' and so on. At no point does it ever threaten to become exciting, but neither does it ever try putting you to sleep. So it's definitely another movie from Rob Cohen.The main problem is that this is a virtual retread (ahem) of the far superior 'Point Break'. The plot? An undercover cop gets involved with a group of fast-living criminals and finds himself with divided loyalties thanks to a beautiful woman. If you've seen 'Point Break' you'll be constantly comparing the two and finding the older movie to be far superior.'Point Break' was well structured, there was a constant pull on the central character, dragging him into the criminal gang until he found himself deeply and inextricably caught up in their activities. Whereas 'The Fast and the Furious''s Officer O'Connor is even more gung-ho than the bad guys. Who can care what happens to the good guy if he wants to be the baddie?It's also lazily directed. 'Point Break' left your heart pounding with its chase scenes or the incomparable parachute drop. Here, there is little that hasn't been seen before and done better. The first car race does work well, but the climactic car chase is far too long, not at all well edited, and falls flat. Likewise it fails to utilise the locations. If you travel through nighttime LA, you see something between a dream and an industrial nightmare - here it is a few neon lit streets that could have been anywhere. What a waste of a great location.Finally the movie has a lazy ending which appears to have been lifted directly from 'Point Break', the cop who is friends with the master criminal in one final confrontation. Except that this time it is a gutless ending which stinks of pandering to focus groups.In its defence, 'The Fast and the Furious' has two great points, the cars and Vin Diesel. The cars - well they are astonishing beasts and lovingly shot, Vin Diesel, once again has real presence on-screen and exudes menace.

This movie is so stupid, you get better material out of ""Moving"" (with Richard Pryor) than this trash. Well for one, culturally they get the Spanish people wrong. They make it seem that Visigoths (basically a Germanic tribe that conquered Spain, giving us last names like Ortiz and Gonzalez) are not white. Second of all this movie stupidly assumes that Visigoths are the only people in the Spanish word who use the word ""bro"" and ""sis."" Even WORSE, that Visigoth women are the only broish women on earth. When that honor goes to Italians and Spanish (non-Visigoths), Delgados and Riveras. They're the ones who say ""bro"" and chill with guys and wear Jordans, not Sanchezes. Yes I say this because of Letty Ortiz. This movie is the dumbest stupidest movie on the face of the earth.

Maybe if I was, it would have seemed more coherent, instead of a of ""day in the life"" mojo. There were too many characters, too many wandering subplots, too many moments where I was going ""huh?"" And then not really caring. I did like that the two major female characters weren't ditzes or helpless. The girlfriend even throws one of the best punches in the film, even though her apparent age did get close to my squick line.

Maybe it's 'cause I know him through Pitch Black/ Chronicles of Riddick, but I want superhero (okay, super anti-hero) stuff. I want him in real fights. I want preternatural.

And he's 36, ""...too old to enjoy TFATF by about...oh, twenty years?""  I am 61 and I thought it was a fun movie.  In New Mexico, we know A LOT about custom cars, low-riders and high-riders, and we understand how (and WHY)one might put tens of thousands of dollars into creating a really boss machine.  Sure, TFATF is pure science fiction, the science being the cars and the fiction being the likelihood of scores of custom race car afficionados being able to commandeer a ""deserted"" street for a midnight race.  But yes, the car cult does cross race and ethnic lines, because it's all about the cars....  And so what if the film has a lot of ""product placement""?  Personally, I didn't even understand half of what the characters were talking about when it came to custom engine parts.  The movie does one thing very well:  it entertains.  Obviously.

Vin Diesel cannot act and should not have been cast as the lead Torreto. He was not convincing and he was as wooden as my front door. There were very few actors in this movie that I felt were worthwhile in watching. The dialogue was so boring that it made the movie feel incredibly slow. It was like Point Break except in cars.

353,christhjian,The king of the car films??,1,31 December 2010,"SOME SPOILERS CONTAINED!The fast and the furious.... If this title is told many people think about the coolest film on earth, the greatest cars and the greatest drivers. I don't know yet why though. I am personally into cars. I'm also interested in mechanics and electronics in general and I do know about that topic so don't tell me I have no clue what I'm going to talk about. The film is made for 6-year-olds. There are ""cool"" (in my point of view pretty stupid) paint jobs, roaring engines and of course NO2! And then there is Vin Diesel who plays cocky Torreto. So they race illegally and the young cop is sent out to investigate the racing. The racing is nothing spectacular. 400 meters straight line, the best built car wins or whose engine can manage the most turbo pressure or nitrous in other words. In total there are only few races throughout the whole film and it's rather boring to watch them. The cars the characters are racing could not be as powerful as real drag racing cars so the handling should be relatively easy as well. That fact already doesn't make the racers heroes in front of my eyes.But racing is acceptable. The worst part of the movie is Torreto's gang truck robbing. It is so unrealistic and stupid that I don't have words for it. Every thinking person can understand how lame it looks. You can't hold on the truck with nothing to worry about when a truck is traveling about 100 km/h. And just how it looks. Truck drivers don't really do anything to get rid of them except the last one who starts shooting the gang. And finally the whole story limps. It's very stereotypical and overall boring. I'm not gonna spoil too much but basically the undercover working cop merges into Torreto's gang and eventually starts defending Torreto. In the end he still founds out that Torreto is involved to truck robbing and tries to put the end to that. He also flirts with Torreto's sister. Some gang members speculate he's a cop but Torreto doesn't take that seriously etc. In other words quite boring story.All in all I'd say that Fast and furious is a weak movie, unrealistic and quite boring.

Here are a few of the things I ""learned"" from this movie:*Mazda RX-7s have six cylinder engines with overhead cams*Nitrous oxide is volatile*NOS is an acronym, and should be pronounced ""NAWWWS""*A 10 second Toyota Supra will have difficulty outrunning a 13 second Ferrari 355 but will have no trouble whatsoever keeping up with a 9 second Dodge Charger*Nitrous can ""blow the welds off"" of an intake*Mitsubishi Eclipses have 7-speed transmissions*It's possible to invest $100,000 into the engine of a Honda S2000 without putting a jet engine in it*Experienced drag racers are afraid of 9 second carsI could really go on forever, but this is just a small sampling.

360,Rioter,What a mess...,2,24 July 2001,"The problem that The Fast and The Furious has is that it is inconsistent. It at times is a police drama, at times a car movie, a gun movie and a romance. As a result, it fails on all counts, and fails spectacularly.
The acting is pitiful, but the writing may be worse. There are times where lines are delivered so poorly that the actors seem to have simply given up trying to salvage the train wreck of a script. The attempts at ""street cred"" are embarrassing (""dawg,"") and the film's method of sounding technically proficient is to deliver lines of dialogue that sound like the actors are reading an inventory list at AutoZone.The most frustrating thing about the movie is that it refused to budge from its somewhat complex story line. While nothing brilliant, the story was more developed that a standard action flick's. This is only a problem because the film was absolutely not up to the task. The action was nonsensical, and surprisingly scarce. The movie lacked a true protagonist because everyone was far too annoying to root for. The actors themselves seemed lost; milling around, reading lines.It is important to mention the cars themselves, though, since this is being billed as a `car movie.' And that depends on what is expected from a car movie. If you are hoping for Camaro SSs and Hemi Cudas, you will be disappointed. If you are looking for Acuras and Hondas, you'll see them. If you're looking for Ronin-style car chases or Blues Brothers silliness, you'll be disappointed. If you want to see tiny cars driving in straight lines in fifteen-second bursts, you'll see it.In the end, the only thing I found at all satisfying was the romance aspect of the movie, which the furthest thing from my mind when I bought my ticket. If I were Vin Diesel, I would have taken one look at the script and one look at my cast mates and then I would have stolen one of their souped up jalopies and hightailed it back to a real movie career.",The Fast and the Furious

374,Shevy1103,A perfect 10...,10,13 April 2013,"I just saw it for the thousand time, and it's still as good as the first time I saw it. Rob Cohen is a pure genius, he truly is. These movies are magnificently awesome and I'm going to tell you why. No Spoiler alerts I promise.Let's start with the basics. The script and plot is close to perfection. Everything from Action, comedic feuds, deceit, romance and amazing surprises. It has a little of everything and a lot of the rest.The characters' difference is brilliant. The background of them is hidden beneath the surface of someone completely different. They're just amazingly entertaining. They're personalities is even better. I can't say anything else because I'm out of words; speechless.The action scenes are incredible for a movie like this. I won't say to much about them though, but if you haven't seen it yet, do so. The first scene when you see how good Brian drives is good and when you see the spark he has, and how his driving improves throughout the movie; nice, very nice. The turning point is pretty good too, but you'll have to find it yourself because I am not going to spoil your movie-experience. The twists in the movie are good, and there is more than one as well. Everyone has secrets, and the secrets are what make this movie just as good as it is. Without the secrets the movie wouldn't be worth watching. OK, let's talk about the acting. First, Mark Vincent (or as you may know; Vin Diesel), I'm a big fan for a reason. There's never anything to say on his acting, so I won't even get into how amazingly amazing he is. So, the rest of them, I am a little iffy on their names so I am just going to call them by their character names. Brian, or the guy who played his role in the movie did a great job and so did Mia and Vince. There wasn't any bad acting in the movie, only good acting and some awesome acting.The mix of secrecy, trust and romance is pretty damn good. I'm running out of adjectives. So I'll just try and wrap this up and give you my concluding opinion and rating of this movie.This movie is definitely worth watching. I really and truly recommend you to watch this movie and its following movies. They are worth watching, ask anyone who've seen them they'll tell you the same. Personally I think it's great and awesome and so does my pal here who watched it with me an hour or so ago. For my rating, based on everything I wrote and didn't write, I give it 10 out of 10 stars. Why? I couldn't find anything negative about it and since I still enjoy watching after all these times I've already seen it it's probably worthy of a perfect 10.Rating: 10/10Thanks for reading my review. Good night, Bon soir, guten nacth, god natt y Buenos noches. Peace & Love God BlessJ.J.Shevy",The Fast and the Furious
375,stephie-12,Loved it!,9,22 February 2004,"This movie is adrenalin charged from the very beginning.  The plot centres around an undercover cop,Brian, who has to investigate a number of hijacks. To do this, he must get to know the chief suspect, Dominic Torretto (a stellar performance by the magnificent Vin Diesel) and his group of street racers who buy Japanese cars and spend thousands of dollars converting them into racing machines.  As well as being a street racer, Dom also runs a store and a garage.  His gang includes his girlfriend Lettie, younger sister Mia and friends Vince, Leon and Jessie.  Brian is drawn deeper into the glamourous world, falling for Mia and discovering a respect for Dom, which conflicts with his objectivity.Rob Cohen does an amazing job of directing this movie, even making a Hitchcock-esque cameo as a pizza delivery guy.  The film is very well acted, particularly by Vin Diesel, who manages to portray the two sided character of the carefree street-racer with the responsible older brother who looks out for Mia and the rest of his team.  His performance is by far the best of the entire film.  Apparently the character of Lettie was not in the original story and unfortunately this shows.  Michelle Rodriguez pouts and sneers her way through the film, and her character has no real depth.  This is the only low point in a truly brilliant film.",The Fast and the Furious
376,dimokas,More than good,7,19 April 2020,"Nice film.

377,dantelerner,Predictable and boring,2,15 May 2018,It's impressing how much impact has this movie done in people. It is NOT so great as I've been told. 4 out of 10 is the fairest score i can think of.,The Fast and the Furious
378,sunface,It hit the spot.,7,3 July 2001,"In contrast to Driven, The Fast and the Furious actually hit the mark it was aiming for.  In fact, I might go so far as to say that it actually surpassed my expectations.  I'm not going to go overboard here and suggest that it is a masterpiece of cinema.  However, it is certainly a cut above the average Hollywood movie.  Firstly, its theme is one of inherent interest.  There is something really quite engaging about the life of a street racer: modifying a run-of-the-mill Japanese compact car into a 500bhp vehicle that can do a quarter-mile in 10 seconds and gathering in the middle of the night with 100 like-minded racers to wager thousands of dollars on quarter-mile drag races.The film had great energy and was just angry enough to give it attitude, but not too angry as to be obnoxious.  The race and chase sequences were excellent; full of high speed action and cool camera angles.  Unfortunately, there were a couple of crashes that people walked away from which, in real life, would have seriously injured those involved.  But apart from the odd departure from real-life, the driving seemed actually pretty accurate.The story and characters were also better than I expected.  There were some tough choices for the hero, Brian (played by the blue-eyed Paul Walker), and you actually felt like you got to know the main players a bit.  Vin Diesel, who plays opposite Walker as the charismatic, if harsh, street racing legend Dominic, has an on-screen presence similar to Ving Rhames.  In fact, it is Diesel who forms the backbone of the film, both within the context of the story and with his performance.In addition to the great races and chases, there are some nice scenesinvolving interaction of the characters.  In particular, a moment towards the end, when Brian reveals his true identity to Dominic, generates a great deal of tension.As with many films of this nature, it would be easy to pick it apart. Dissecting the inconsistencies in the story and illogical decisions of the characters would, however, just be a futile engagement.  This film is more about the experience than the meaning... more about the journey than the destination.",The Fast and the Furious
379,labebe,"Great Cars, Cool Stunts, Bad Movie",6,23 June 2001,"I attended an advance screening of ""The Fast and the Furious"" with high anticipation. Here, I thought, is my cool sexy action movie for the summer. I was looking for pure entertainment with just a thread of credibilty. What I got was a lopsided movie with great cars, amazing stunts, crappy acting, and bad editing. If one-fourth of the attention given to the cars had been paid to the acting and the human film story, the movie would have been just fine. Unfortunately, this was not the case.First of all, this movie really reminded me of Point Break with Keanu Reeves, only instead of surfing, street racing is the centerpiece.Both stories are completely improbable. Both stories involve green cops sent to infiltrate gangs of thieves who use the loot to fund their expensive hobbies. In both films, the hero jeopardizes his case by gaining a dangerous level of respect for the charismatic leader of the band of thieves.  The big difference between the two films is that while Point Break works, The Fast and the Furious does not. The failing point of this film is the lead actor. Paul Walker is the sucking-chest wound of this movie. Yeah, he's pretty, but he completely unable to emote or communicate anything about his character. Even in the presence of excellent actors like Vin Diesel and Ted Levine, he is like a plank of wood. Jordana Brewster isn't too pro either. All the other actors(including Michelle Rodriguez)do a fine job.
Had the basic criteria been met(competent lead actor, clean editing), The Fast and the Furious could have been great. As is, it is moderately awful.",The Fast and the Furious
380,wiztwas,"Car Stunts, Car Stunts, Nothing Else",1,2 August 2001,"If you want to see lots of Car Stunts and are a Petrol Head then this is a great movie, for the rest of us the lack of plot, dialogue, and character formation makes for poor viewing.A blokes buddy film with lots of fast cars and nothing else.",The Fast and the Furious
381,jim.adamson,A Superior 21st Century B Movie,6,27 March 2002,"In terms of the profile of the performers involved and the money spent on its production, this film seems to be a minor picture in comparison to the megabucks blockbusters the studios release. However, considering it was made by a major studio and apes the style of the blockbusters, you can't really call this an Independent picture either. It seems the best way to define this movie is as a B-Movie, changes in film convention and monetary inflation notwithstanding.This is not intended to devalue the film - Assault on Precinct 13, New Jack City and some of the best movies of the 1940s were B-movies. All it means is it doesn't have stars and doesn't pretend to be a particularly original work of art, and would consider itself a success if enough people buy tickets for it to make its money back. Many such films are forgettable, some are patently awful, some are entertaining on some level, while a few manage to hit the right mixture and make for very good cinema. They also used to provide a great breeding ground for new talent to try their luck with limited resources and less risk than the big leagues, and the cinema could do with more such opportunities for new film-makers to try out. ""The FastAnd The Furious"" doesn't quite hit the heights achieved by John Carpenter's early work or the golden age of Noir but I'm certainly not sorry I watched it.Paul Walker comes across as a blond Keanu but is engaging as the undercover cop investigating high-speed robberies whose culprits seem to hang around the illegal street racing scene in LA. Vin Diesel (who was superb as the convict in Pitch Black) is charismatic in the more interesting ""guy on the edge"" role, and everyone else does their job effectively. The familiar story follows of an undercover mission  becoming complicated by loyalty, emotions, and things not being as simple as they look, with some good high speed driving sequences along the way. The performances, direction, characterisation and dialogue are not exactly Oscar-winning but to use the racing analogies used by all the papers who reviewed this movie, it is flashy, has a good engine and overcomes a slight lack of finesse through pace and energy. Better still, you can tell from the opening titles and delirious first race that this is not intended as anything more than fun entertainment, so you forgive the cliches and occasional false move from the script. It certainly stands comparison with any of the $100m mega productions against which it was competing.The whole thing plays out nicely to a big action finale, and it chooses one of the handful of recognised ways for a story like this to end. Overall, it was a fun movie and worth watching once for anyone who likes a bit of unpretentious high speed fun. Rent the video, relax and enjoy.",The Fast and the Furious
382,cgcrossont,"...and I thought ""Gone In 60 Seconds"" was silly!",4,5 February 2002,"Let me start off by saying that I have yet to watch any believable car movie in my 33 years on earth. One would think that as time went on and movie technology improves, the car movies would get better also. Not happening! This movie makes ""Days of Thunder"", ""Gone In 60 Seconds"", ""Hot Rod"", ""CannonBall Run"", ""Dukes Of Hazzard"", etc. look realistic. I know it's a movie but how about getting some pros on the set to monitor some of the situations and common terms? I am in the racing business so I may be a little extra hard to please but I'm not that tough. I want to be entertained just like the next person but I found myself being constantly annoyed at much of the movie.   Above all else, N.O.S. is one of many manufacturers of nitrous oxide systems sold in the United States. Their company name is Nitrous Oxide Systems and they are called N.O.S. for short. N.O.S. was never meant to be pronounced as a word. I wanted to put my foot through the TV everytime I heard the word ""nos"". Anyone who knows anything about street racing would know that there are many nicknames for nitrous (the juice, the squeeze, the bottle, the button, the jammy, giggle-gas, the spray or just simply nitrous) but I have yet to hear anyone say ""nos"". I guess I may hear it now that this movie came out but I can tell you it was not that way before.   Another thing, I don't think Captain Kirk ever went as fast as these guys did. The movie made the racers seem as if they hit Warp Factor 8 so I was somewhat surprised that they never made it to the other side of the galaxy during the course of their race.    What was that plate that unbolted itself and flew out of the bottom of the main character's car? I believe that this was another Warp speed type thing. I noticed in the Star Trek movies that when the Enterprise would hit maximum warp, things would start shaking and Scotty would have to tell the Captain that he's giving him all shes got so I assume that when the nitrous was used, these cars experienced the similar effects.   Have you, the reader, ever been in a drag race? No? Well, I have and I can tell you that I have yet to see one or be in one where the lead changes more than one time (aside from an engine failure or crash). We are only talking 1/4 mile here (1320 feet), not a 500 mile circle track race. I realize that this may seem more exciting to the viewer but it just don't happen.   How about that amazing wheelstand that Vin Diesel's car did? It looked like an NHRA Super Stocker leaving the line (taking off). The only problem with that is that he had street tires on it which would never grip the road well enough to transfer that amount of torque to lift the car like that. A smokey, mile long burnout would have been more true to life but then the race would have been no contest; he would have lost by a mile!   I could go on but I don't want to seem like I am being too critical. I have to admit that I was slightly entertained with the storyline. The movie is really geared (no pun intended) toward 14-18 year old males and I can understand that. Not every movie is made for me. I don't need karate and fast paced action to be entertained like our medicated, hyper-active younger generation needs to be. Praise the Lord that I did not fall for taking the family out to the movie theater for this one!",The Fast and the Furious

Cars like Toyota Supra, Honda Civic and American classic Charger. It is nice treat for all car lovers. When you hear that engine sound and that NOS boost you just wanna get there and race. Racing and chasing is pretty much realistic. But movie is not all about racing it gives connection between main characters that will last trough other movies. It is very underrated movie. I rated it 8 cause of his lack of action. It has nice plot so you won't get bored at all but there is something missing.

388,dkw001,"Fun, but tried too hard",6,6 March 2006,"There's one thing that's always bugged me about this movie: that it's not what everyone who hasn't seen it thinks it is. For whatever reason, there had to be a tacked-on crime story, the whole subplot with Johnny Tran (he should've had a separate movie, and it's a shame that the amazing motorcycle stuntwork is now completely forgotten), and lots of interesting but generally uncohesive exposition about Dominic Toretto. In fact, you could compare this movie to a ""ricer"", with lots of bits that look cool but don't add anything.If you want action, you got it. The racing is always exciting (well, as exciting as going in a straight line can be), the trailer hijackings need to be seen to be believed, and of course, I loved the motorcycle chase at the end. But I wanted a movie about street racing. STREET RACING, not cops or crime families or vendettas or divided loyalties or love triangles or any of that meaningless junk. A good screenwriter could make a movie about racing work. As it is, we're left with a fairly generic action movie that's a notch above average.",The Fast and the Furious

But we're good guys, our leaders dad died in a car crash and that's why we are the way we are. And the truck drivers that get robbed are the bad guys of course - along with the cops. And what's with the cars???? Why are they all basically Asian or Asian-looking in America??? And those colors...yuck. What about the green light from under car....kinda cool in the races maybe, but when robbing a truck??? Get real! Everything sucked about this movie...including the actors.

The <ahem> ""plot"" twists were stuck on at random in a misguided attempt to add depth to this puddle. Lose the undercover cop thread completely or actually do something with it, beef up the Tran rivalry or drop that too, add to the romantic interest, tone down the macho a**hole rivalry between the meat-head and the new guy (or at least make her a bit sympathetic to the poor loser who obviously has had a crush on her since they were kids), make the kid do a bit more to prove himself, add a couple more driving scenes with some turns instead of just straight-line acceleration, and you might just have a decent movie.Of course, it would be a close copy of ""Point Break"" (substitute drivers for surfers, Vin Diesel for Patrick Swayze) with DriveTime(tm) special effects lifted from ""Driven"" and a plot that would make ""Gone in 60 Seconds"" look profound, but it would be more watchable. I found myself actually checking my watch several times. I made it through ""Pleasantville"" with only a couple of watch checks. Whoo. Yay. They hit the nitrous buttons...yet again. How thrilling.Almost the only good scenes in the movie were due to the real street-racer extras who lent this movie some badly needed fun.

I gave it a 8 out of 10 just for the rush it gave me. Ignore what everyone has said. See it for yourself and judge. I don't normally like teen movies, but i liked The Fast and the Furious.",The Fast and the Furious
402,bryanlaszlo,Think 'Point Break' crossed with 'Gran Turismo'.,7,9 January 2002,"This was an entertaining movie despite being unoriginal.  The characters are suprisingly well-developed, and the cars are pretty cool- though, being from the Detroit area, I was hoping for a bigger dose of Motor City muscle. But, it's true to its So-Cal setting and mindset.  Unfortunately the story has already been done- replace the racers with surfers, the trucks with banks, Vin Diesel with Patrick Swayze and voila, you have Point Break.  Still, it's a joyride to be sure, with awesome (albeit being obviously staged) car stunts and a 'furious' pace.  If you like fast cars and drag-racing, you'll enjoy this movie.",The Fast and the Furious
403,sharif68,A Thrilling Joyride!,10,27 July 2001,"The Fast and the Furious is a thrilling joyride of a movie that's full of spark and vigor, even if the script is full of cliches. The movie (and it's title) is kind of a throwback those 1950's exploitation flicks that where shown in a double or triple feature (along with cartoons) in a neighborhood theatre. The movie deals with L.A. street racers and an undercover cop who's investigating the leader of this group of racers who may be involved in a string of highway truck robberies. The plot has been rehashed from other films, but it's the action that really get your attention to the point that you could really care less about the plot. It gives you everything you could ask for in a popcorn summer flick. I was pleasantly surprised.Another thing that surprised me was how good the acting is in this movie. The young cast of Paul Walker, Jordana Brewster, and Michelle Rodriguez do a fine job, but the real star of the movie is Vin Diesel. With his steely gaze and Lee Marvin-like voice, Diesel has a mixture of machismo and vulnerability that commands attention. He is an actor to watch.",The Fast and the Furious

407,demon-drifter,Looking back,8,9 February 2007,"When the Fast and the Furious first appeared it was an awesome film to watch. The cars and street racing scenes were new and exciting. After watching Tokyo Drift and Torque a couple of years later it is clear that the original spawned an entire new genre of action film. The new genre clearly plays on the clichéd teenagers dream of racing fast cars through busy streets. Street racing in real life is sadly lacking compared to these films and fatal accidents seem to happen a lot more frequently. While the original and Tokyo Drift have upped the ante, the other films such as Biker Boyz and Torque are very disappointing. We should probably be used to that now though because its the ultimate Hollywood cliché...",The Fast and the Furious
408,adamhart-1,An inconsistent attempt at what could have been so much more.,6,16 March 2002,"Taking one of the words out of the title, I am furious that the film did not live up to its potential.  By this I mean the fact that yet again, we have a dumb Hollywood script laden with the corniest lines imaginable.  Credibility is also riding high in deficiency, when you consider the fact that Vin Diesel's character must be invincible, seeing as how he manages to escape injury, after colliding with a truck at over 150 mph.  Retreating back from the criticism for a moment, the cars in the film are breathtaking and the score certainly pumps out serious wattage--although that's the problem, the cars are the focus point and being that's the case, shouldnt Rob Cohen (the director) have constructed better action sequences, that actually had depth enough to keep his audience entertained.  You would think so.Struggling to find a commendable word to say I can only consider the aspects about the film that could have been so easily improved, given the subject matter; if you think about it fast cars, babes, violence and sex should make for a solid, thrilling 90 minutes.  Instead we settle for the sluggish, dull experience that most of us would gladly replace with GONE IN 60 SECONDS any day of the week.  Let's face it at least GONE IN 60 had Angelina, not to mention action guru Jerry Bruckheimer on board.Despite the distinct lack of praise from, well a large proportion of the western hemisphere, 'THE FAST AND THE FURIOUS' still managed to be lucrative by taking $144 million at the US box office.

It's got speed, speed, and more speed. The cast is a little too studded, with an unrealistic bad boy undercop. I mean I like Paul Walker but his pretty boy image doesn't give him the actual tough sincere character that i think should've been played. Some of his dialogue was pretty weak too. The film though was awesome. Diesel and Rodriguez look like they got real chemistry.",The Fast and the Furious

I had only seen the first film when it came out and some of TOKYO DRIFT on TV. I gave the fifth film a shot anyway because the trailers made it look really fun and it got good word of mouth. To my surprise, I enjoyed it. It was a nice fun stunt car heist flick with no pretensions of being anything other than it was.So here I am, watching the first film and I quickly realize why I didn't embrace the series during its initial films. This first installment is basically POINT BREAK with cars, but without The Buse. The first race is pretty fun at first but after that it just didn't do much for me. It takes itself too seriously and Paul Walker isn't really much of a leading man to carry the drama this flick tries to inject with the whole thing with him being torn between friendship and duty.

Everything was random...All they do is waste time. The racing scenes were very lame. The trailers made this movie look tight...but it's NOT! -Characters. Van Deisal and Paul Walker are not even protagonists. I thought they were losers who didn't have a life! They didn't stay true to the game. Conclusion: Don't watch this film. Save your money.

Its dialog is far from deathless and it has patches which are memorable -- only for triteness. Nevertheless, I found myself swept up in the races and concerned with whether Vin Diesel would discover Paul Walker's reason for wanting to hang with him. Is Toretto (Diesel)behind the high jacking of the contents of trucks on the highway? The opening scene showed such a robbery but by the time you see all the cars driven by Toretto and his friends you can no longer remember what the cars looked like in that exciting scene. All in all I enjoyed the film and its resolutions (Then again, I watch Patrick Swayze in ""Roadhouse"" every time I can.)

419,Jeremy Farrance,Not Since the Road Warrior...,8,16 June 2002,"This movie was a trip.  I never expected to have such a wild ride and so much adrenalized fun.  The main reason I went to see this movie was Vin Diesel - who is not very well know - yet - but I am pretty sure he will be. He has an incredible voice (he was the robot in The Iron Giant, a highly recommended favorite of mine) and a charismatic presence that reminds me of a young Marlon Brando.  He also played Riddick in Pitch Black which I plan to review eventually.Don't get me wrong, this movie does not make my top 10 or anything close. The story is pretty generic, young-undercover-cop material with only a not-too surprising twist or two.  Some of the acting was a little strained and weak which can often tank a whole movie (for me).  But this movie did something to me that I haven't felt since the 2nd Mad Max film, The Road Warrior... it raised the bar on visual action and ""the need for speed"".  It wasn't cinematography either - to me (I am not an expert) - but something incredible happened in the way this movie was edited, filmed, and scored. It was just a thing of beauty.  The sounds, the motor, the pitch, the beat, and then being jacked inside the engine; to spit through the fuel injection, feel the power of combustion and then be ejected out the tail pipe as the car roars away from you... breathtaking... and all that is just the rush of the car lurching in to first gear on go.I was expecting to recommend this movie just so you can get a handle on who Vin Diesel is and how great this guy is gonna be in movies in the coming years (in my humble opinion).  I didn't expect to O.D. on adrenaline and walk out of the theater ready to rev the engine right out of my poor little Mitsubishi Galant's frame.  I warn you - seriously - be careful driving home after watching this movie.  For me, doing 42 M.P.H. in a 35 on the way home felt like I was standing still.  It was painfully frustrating.  After being reasonably disappointed by Pearl Harbor and The Mummy Returns, this movie has restored my faith.Normally I walk out of a movie feeling like I know when a director has made a great movie. I have to say I was confused when thinking about the director on this movie. I haven't even gone and looked up who it is - I usually do and try to keep the names and credits straight when I know a great director or at least one I recognize and/or like. But I guess that is what I am trying to say here; I did not get that feeling this time. I somehow - do not - feel like it was the director that delivered this incredible ride to me. Somewhere between the hyper-speed action, incredible music/sound, and the charisma of Vin Diesel I want to believe this movie hit its mark regardless of the director. Or maybe they knocked a damn good movie up two notches beyond what the director envisioned.",The Fast and the Furious

They don't ruin the film with any CGI's, it's all real. After leaving the theater the parking lot was roaring, people were gunning their engines and racing off.

Bad acting (except for vin diesel), cheesy lines, unoriginal story, but a fairly original subject matter for a movie... Street racing.  And did I mention revolutionary/AWESOME direction of action and racing scenes.   The last 5 minutes of the movie alone are worth the money to see this movie.  It leaves you with one hell of a WOW feeling. The movie features ""new"" car racing, that is mostly Asian Cars suped up with nitris oxide or premium engine modifications to make them extra fast. Only at the end do we see the highlight of the film an old hot rod that leavez you droolin at the sound of it's revving. This movie is pretty much an exact remake of Point Break except with Street racing the subject matter instead of surfing.  But the storyline and plot are good enough to get you through to all the action/racing scenes which are incredible and groundbreaking. The director does an awesome job with the action/racing scenes.  The new cool way the race scenes are filmed can be compared to the new cool way the fighting scenes were filmed in the matrix (except no special effects here).

424,eternitti,Forgettable,5,7 April 2002,"(contains minor spoilers)I saw The Fast And The Furious opening weekend. I loved the previous year's high-budget car movie, Gone In 60 Seconds, so I was looking forward to this one. It was ok, but I was pretty disappointed. I was looking for something that would really push things a bit and add something new. Instead, you get this mediocre cliched undercover cop movie.The only two scenes that stand out after seeing the movie are the first street race where Paul Walker kills his car off and the final scene. The rest, even the highway scene either have been done way too much before or just aren't very impressive.This is a B-movie. It may have made over three times its budget, but The Fast and The Furious is still a B-movie. It's an action movie too, so there really aren't any demanding roles here. You could put Walter Cronkite in Paul Walker's role (maybe even Michelle Rodriguez's role) and you wouldn't be able to tell the difference. That's because Vin Diesel carries the film. He's the only thing that saved this one. He adds quite a bit to the action scenes. He's a great actor too. That's always a plus. Still, he can't save The Fast and The Furious from mediocrity. Maybe if the characters and action scenes weren't so cliched, this would have been better. The car freaks may be impressed, but I'm the kind of guy who would take an old 1988 Pontiac over what they were driving.6/10",The Fast and the Furious

It's not a movie masterpiece, it's full of cliches (buddy cop / heist movie / bromance driven flick), the CGI is silly, the characters are pretty one-dimensional, and the story lacks cohesiveness. Also, acting is all over the place, but this is Vin Diesel we are talking about, not the likes of Pacino, DeNiro or Hoffman.Yet, it's a fun movie to watch, that delivers great amounts of action sprinkled with some humor.In many Ways, this movie is exactly what i thought it would be, and that's a good thing.

I did not even bother to watch it to the (certainly highly dramatic) finale because I got bored s###less. Not much else to say, but whoever participated in that movie (in whatever position - from director to the last extra - except of course for Vin, who shines out in this like a shaft of gold when all around is dark) should under no circumstances quit their day jobs. Laughable plot, incredibly bad acting... well, maybe, just maybe it has got all the right stuff for a c-movie classic.

Many people can relate to Vin's Character Dom as he is like gravity, many things get pulled to him. Also, it becomes apparent in the film that as Brian joins Dom's group, their lives start falling apart... Jesse ends up dying, Vince ends up with a life-threatening injury, Leon and Letty are not seen again, Vin escapes the L.A. scene and nobody really knows whats happens to Mia. Brian was meant to be working for the good of things as a police officer and he feels the guilt of making their lives fall apart and that is the reason why he lets Dom go at the end of the movie. 2 Fast 2 Furious however, does not tie the loose ends up that this movie leaves behind, which is rather disappointing. 8/10",The Fast and the Furious
433,Karri_Koivusalo,Rather weak crime movie with superficial street racing elements,5,27 April 2006,"In an ironic sense, this movie is like much of the car tuning business these days. That is, cheap and fake, like the plastic hood pin replicas you attach on the hood with foam tape. This movie has plenty of things to make a car enthusiast cringe; the way which this movie bunches car tuning, street racing and organized crime tightly together isn't exactly the most pleasing approach. The stuff about double-clutching, failing to use proper terms and very loose involvement on events in a race gives an impression the writer gained all his knowledge about race driving out of a five-point bulletin list on how to drive a Nascar racer. Finally, the movie practically drops out of street racing premise after 1/4th way through.The street racing theme is only a facade to a substandard crime movie. It's soon obvious the movie is more about blasting away with guns than racing on the streets. Making a distinct good guy - bad guy -scenario and thus having the police to sanction the main character's actions, the movie did not have to deal with the legal and moral issues of street racing or the dangers involved. Pure street racing as such would probably have been too difficult a subject to the writer and too controversial for the producers, so they put guns, explosions, hi-jackers and an oriental gangster mob into the movie, none of which really belongs (well, except perhaps the gangster bunch, but they were made OTT, big time). The race scenes aren't that well made either; they're about driving a straight line and when to hit the nitrous (or Nnnaaawwwzzz as it's called in the movie) for victory. It's not about who's the best driver, it's about who has the most $$$'s under the hood. There's not enough car stuff to keep enthusiasts interested, the plot pretty much sucks rocks through a garden hose and the bulk of the movie is generic crime movie material. The latter half of the movie is almost completely disconnected from the first, the two elements (racing and crime) support each other in a truly superficial way, and the dialog is awkward.",The Fast and the Furious

When that movie became a monstrous box-office smash, I have planned to watch the whole franchise from the very beginning. With that said, It's time to review The Fast and the Furious, a solid start of the movie franchise ride!In the movie, we have the legendary Paul Walker and Vin Diesel who both did fantastic performances throughout. I also have to mention that the variety of tuned cars in this movie is pretty unique. We have the Supra, the Civic and more which can be perfect for car lovers (like me). Speaking of cars, the car chases and races are quite fun to watch. Although there were less than I expect but it's still fitting. The music by BT is another thing that fits well in the movie, as well as the songs. They give us the music theme of tuned car racing. Finally, the pace is in an acceptable speed of over 100 mins, just the way I like it.Now that I watched Fast & Furious 1 & 7, the journey goes on as we head on to 2 Fast 2 Furious!

However, as a word of caution, it may not be what you expected.  Here's what I found.Before renting the DVD last weekend, I had considered buying it for 2 reasons:1)  Vin Diesel is one of the best new actors and I liked him in his previous films.2)   I am a former high school drag racer and still love fast cars.Based on the previews and the promos for the movie, I had thought that Vin played the main character.  I was wrong.  Unfortunately, Paul Walker gets substantially more screen time and the movie is really about his character, not Vin's.  One thing I think everyone can agree on:  Paul Walker is no Vin Diesel!!!! Additionally, there really isn't as much action as you would think.  As some other reviewers have mentioned, there is a substantial amount of screen time spent with the actors standing around the cars and talking smack.  There's also an unconvincing love story (which eats up the minutes) between Paul Walker's character and the sister of Vin's character.As a result, I'm glad I didn't blow the $20 to buy it.  One viewing was plenty for me.  However, it wasn't a waste of time either.Overall, I gave the movie 6 out of 10 stars.  It wasn't nearly as good as I was expecting, but it also wasn't trash.  Sure, it's a familiar story that's been done several times before, and better, but in general I try not to let previous versions of a story influence me.  I try to let each movie stand on its own merits.I hope you find this helpful.",The Fast and the Furious

446,loach10,The Lame and the Ludicrous,2,16 September 2001,"Where does one begin, coincidentally a dilemma which the director also faced, with considerably less success. I entered this movie with low expectations hoping, vainly, to be surprised. Needless to say it failed to meet even these low expectations. I actually left the cinema, feeling personally insulted that a director could show such contempt for the audience. The acting was uniformally appalling, not in the least part aided by a script that was, quite frankly laughable; 'and if I win, I win the respect.' The actors handled the complexity of human emotions like warring neanderthals; I would be tempted to read into this a brutal misanthropic polemic, though this of course would be crediting the director with far more than he deserves. The very fact that the first hour escaped the cutting room floor is an act of escapology comparable to exploits of Houdini himself. Admittedly, it improved marginally as it progressed, though by this time I was numb, feeling drained, overwhelmed and violated, not least by the almost constant grating noise of screeching engines. Oh yes, and the attempt to get away from crude ethnic stereotypes was... well er absent.  In conclusion if the thought of fast cars, vacuous 'ladies' and at least 10 minutes of fascinating dialogue about car engines has you salivating, then this may, I repeat may, be the film for you. If on the other hand you value the more conventional customs of the film industry; plot, characterization, drama, suspense and intrigue, then please, please avoid.   */***** (this is the first film I've ever reviewed as a *!, it really was that bad!)",The Fast and the Furious

451,edwinbodegraaf,A buddy movie with a heart,6,7 July 2021,"This was my first experience with the Fast and Furious series and I wasn't disappointed. A charming Hollywood version of Rebel Without a Cause mixed with a somewhat unconvincing heist film. But at heart it's an old fashioned buddy movie, with Vin Diesel and Paul Walker as handsome and charismatic leads. (It's no surprise that they would return for future episodes of the series, until Walker's tragic death in 2013.) Not much is made of their female counterparts, played by a sultry Michelle Rodriguez and the very beautiful Jordana Brewster. You might say that the real leads of this film are the cars, but although a lot is made of the technical side of things, the focus fortunately is on the people behind the wheel. The car chases and races that the series is known for are great though. It's one of those films where as a viewer you get the idea that the actors all got on in real life and that it was real fun to make. Unpretentious film making at its best and a great introduction to one of the most successful film series of all times.",The Fast and the Furious

453,benestine,One of the worst movies I ever saw in the theater.,1,14 May 2002,"I know this movie isn't supposed to be a work of art.  It's just supposed to be a mindless roller coaster ride with car chase scenes.  I can respect shallow entertainment sometimes.  THIS MOVIE IS AWFUL. I'm not going to go into detail about the horrible acting; predictable, unoriginal plot; and the complete absence of any kind of meaning.  This is a dumb action movie that is just supposed to appeal to a person's shallow senses. The running time of this movie is 106 min.  Maybe 15 min of this movie actually has car chase scenes or action happening on the screen.  A mindless action movie should be at least 1/3 action.  Most of this movie is filled with unlikeable characters in their 20's, who act like they're in junior high, just conversing with each other like morons.  The only character in this movie I liked was the truck driver towards the end of the movie trying to kill all the main characters with a shotgun. (2 out of 10)(If you want to see a movie with great car chase scenes, see the movie RONIN)",The Fast and the Furious
454,whartonluke,Pretty good high intensity movie,7,11 July 2013,"I had never seen any of the fast and furious films before I just watched this one recently and had heard from some friends that they were absolutely amazing! I finally decided to watch the 1st one and see what it was all about. Brian O' Connor is a cop who is sent undercover into the street racing world to bust some crooks who have been stealing millions of dollars worth of electronics to pay for their extremely fast (and furious) cars. I enjoyed watching it but it was not a jump and amaze me completely movie. I enjoyed how Brian O' Connor was not revealed to be a cop until around 30 minutes or so into the movie. It made you feel for him that much more as he tried to gain respect in the hard undercover world of street racing. The races were very high intensity and fun to watch, even if I do not know hardly anything about cars. Vin Diesel has since lost his appeal but he was great as the big bad leader of the street racing team around him. Overall, 7/10.",The Fast and the Furious
455,Achylles,True blockbuster.,10,23 October 2011,"Firstly, this movie became a masterpiece and a blockbuster of all times - not because of it's plot, literally it is plain, but because of the scenes with the fast, tuned, hot cars, having neon lights and nitrous which was something people had never seen before. There had been many racing movies but this one is unique itself because of the illegal racing stuff. In my opinion this movie is very underrated because of it's low ratings and disliking reviews complaining about plot, but - come on, guys this ain't a movie whose purpose is to having a nice plot. If you want a nice plot movie go watch Star Wars but the purpose of the F&F franchise is to see some fast beautiful cars, hot chicks and affairs which are not about love but something more... I admit that the writing was not well-made but the defense of this disadvantage is that action films don't need perfect writing - go watch a good drama instead if you want a good writing.What I mean is that this movie is the origin of the illegal street racing movies and was the first of it's kind. Then we saw Street Racer, Born to Race and even the failure of the year - 200 MPH. But all those movies were inspired by the Fast and the Furious franchise. The plot is plain and predictable otherwise it is different than any plot in any other action movie made before the movie. The acting was great - all the actors made the deal especially Paul Walker and Vin Diesel, whose roles made them famous and the reason being famous now is only the movie. The special effects, that every action movie need to have, are immaculate and the stuff used in the movie is perfect. In addition, people in real life became inspired about tuning their own cars and this movie is the reason about that. In my opinion if you're a fan of cars you should definitely watch the movie and will truly love it. If you expect too much or are a drama/comedy person you will also not be disappointed but also not so satisfied. ""Damn"" I can say so many things about this movie that literally mean a defence of itself but I would repeat myself so I will skip to the summary.... The movie is a blockbuster itself. It is plot is plain and predictable but because it's unique itself and is origin of all illegal street racing movies so this makes the meaning of the plot inconsequential. The acting is awesome as immaculate are the special effects too. The writing is typical for an action movie, despite being awful but what really makes this hustle and bustle movie amazing is it's uniqueness and beautiful adrenaline among fast and tuned cars. Recommendation - just watch if you're big fan of cars and adrenaline. Don't expect much if you're not.Plot - mild, plain, predictable though it is unique and doesn't need to be amazing. 6/10.Acting - Amazing; Vin, Jordana, Michelle and Paul do very nice job. 10/10Writing - as plain as the plot is though it's very typical to the classic action movies. 6/10Performance - Immaculate special effects; Very beautiful designed cars; Spectacular racing scenes. 10/10OVERALL: 8/10, though I give it an excellent personal TEN because it is literally my favourite franchise.",The Fast and the Furious

457,Ariel_Ronnie,Technically and Ethically Flawed,4,14 October 2008,"Rather than just bashing this film (albeit well deserved) let me start with the good points. 'The Fast and the Furious' has good production values, cinematography, and performances. The director does a decent job at maintaining pace and the story does offer some character development. Where this movie hurts itself is: 1) Apparent lack of a technical consultant. In the first race scene, Walker's car begins spewing nuts, bolts, and washers from the dashboard (?). Apparently he has plenty of spare parts in places they should not be. In the same race he burns out his cylinders and yet is still able to outrun the police. This movie is filled with such technical flaws (I won't even mention hitting a semi head on and walking away without a scratch); 2) The good guys are a crooked cop and a thief who hijacks trucks. The bad guys are truckers who defend themselves and Asians.; 3) The film-makers should have seriously set aside their own prejudice.-- Although the technical inaccuracies frankly will not bother many at all (hey, if it's entertaining, why not), it's basic asinine concept of protagonists and it's expressed prejudice make it something I cannot recommend. There are several stellar reviews for this movie on this page that rate this movie as good to great. Just take a look at the number of copies of this DVD which are available and the cheap asking price. This should give you an indication that this is a movie you will not want to see again and that at least a few of the stellar reviews are from people wanting to get rid of their copy.",The Fast and the Furious

There is nothing redeeming about the story and it offers absolutely no insight on anything meaningful.That said, whenever I find this movie on my on-screen cable guide, my fingers inexplicably move the cursor to it and press ""OK"".  Maybe there's something about brightly-colored cars, hot chicks and revving engines that affects me on a subconscious level.  Maybe it's the cutting-edge soundtrack or Vin Diesel's bald head.

464,stalemilk1,Hackneyed,5,17 July 2001,"Although decent, this movie was better the first time I saw it back when it starred Keanu Reeves, Patrick Swayze and was named ""Point Break"".  To quote my friend, ""Undercover cops?  Asian Gangs?  What is this, the 80s?""Basically, this movie appeals to the MTV crowd which needs to be stimulated every few seconds by bright lights and loud noises in an effort to maintain their short attention spans.  There were several glaring errors in this movie that led me to believe that it was written by a film student who tried to take his spice up his loser adolescent years by trying to portray the teenagers who put thousands of dollars worth of rims, subwoofers and the like into their $500 car.  I'm sorry Mr. Writer sir, but this hackneyed movie does not justify your youth, back when you worked for minimum wage and later spent it on a new muffler.First, truck drivers are union and the merchandise is insured.  Therefore, drastic measures are not needed to rob trucks.  Have you ever seen ""Goodfellas,"" when Ray Liotta and Joe Pesci robbed the truck?  Although my memory is fuzzy, I can be sure that they did not use harpoons.Second, a Ferrari will never race any tuned car.  I know people who have Lotuses, Porsches, and Corvettes, and they refuse to race them.  Why? Because by virtue of owning an expensive sports car, you already showed the person up.The list goes on (including the fact that the actors are in their mid-twenties, and the people who actually do this kinda stuff for fun usually mature out of it by the time they hit 19.)But there is one positive:  The movie had a good ending, even though it was a rip-off of Point Break.

They look like they came out of a cheesy Gamera film. And they sound like a retard trying to sing an opera. A God-awful buzzing noise. I frankly don't care how fast they are, or how much boost they run. If you have 10,000 dollars laying around, you can make almost any vehicle do anything you want. This film just glorifies what I can't stand - white guys, and other non-blacks, trying to act tough and hard with their gay, little, girlie cars.This trendy feckfest, and the two movies that followed, loves make the dumbest comparisons. A 4 cylinder car running nitrous and/or turbo should not be compared to a single cam, pushrod V8 with normal aspiration. Most horsepower figures should not be trusted either. How were the dyno sensors calibrated? How was the engine treated at the time of testing? If you want an example of V8 turbo, look at the Sledgehammer Vette'.Around 900 horses and 254.76 mph.

But, to be fair, I enjoyed the movie more than I thought and ended up buying the DVD. I didn't mind the story as much as some others here have; I wasn't expecting a remarkable story in a car racing movie.  The acting, however, is TERRIBLE. None of Toretto's gang can act especially Toretto (Vin Diesel) himself. Some of his lines are terrible to begin with but the way he portrays them makes them one hundred times worse. (possible spoiler) I feel at times the filmmakers wanted us the viewers to root for (and possibly feel sorry for) Toretto stealing from semi trucks.  I actually found myself rooting for the truck driver with the shot gun because Toretto and his gang turn out to be scumbags.

It had the best cinematography since Crouching Tiger and Fight Club, and it had good special effects.  If all anyone ever watched was a movie like Traffic that was an intellectual movie then he or she would not have a credible say about the quality of a movie.

472,superstar_carnage,A Fast and Furious movie,6,27 December 2007,"Fast cars. Big engines. Big Egos. High velocity action. Michelle Rodriguez. Definitely one of my favourite films based on these factors. TFATF is a high velocity action packed street-racing movie with a simple plot. the story is cliché ridden but it works well incorporating the street-racing aspect and its characters into it. Although to film critics the film is just a mindless street racing movie with a back-story that was made to entertain audiences under the age of 25. Though it is true that the movie draws its audience through the street-racing aspect.The film is not a cinematic classic, however it cannot be placed as another Gone in 60 Seconds because the two movies are not the same. Although both centred around high powered cars, their plots are significantly different. The plot of TFATF is simple and cliché along with some of the dialogue but it delivers on thrills and high intensity stunts. It falls nothing short of hitting the audience with fast cars, sexy women and heart-pounding stunts.The film can appeal to both male and female audiences; sexy women and fast cars for the guys and the motorheads; and the muscle-bound, action-heroism of Vin Diesel for the ladies.Despite the plot somewhat lacking any depth or complexity, the movie is successful in drawing its target audience of under 25's and proves to be a highly entertaining blockbuster smash.6.5/10",The Fast and the Furious
473,seod1999,Fast cars...bad acting,5,16 July 2002,"As others have already said, I didn't have an interest in seeing this movie, even though my friends always made a big deal about it. The only way I was seeing this movie was if I didn't have to pay for it, which I didn't.  I enjoyed the fast cars, because, I like fast cars.  I am sure that this movie, and the sequel which is scheduled to come out next year, will forever be a cult classic amongst the import-race car enthusiasts.  Yet, those people will watch the movie not for the amazing acting or directing or writing, but for the fast paced car scenes.  This is the way I would only watch this movie again, just to see the fast cars. Vin Diesel was boring, monotone, and simply unbelievable as a person.  His speeches were well rehersed, but they came off as phony and unemotional. Paul Walker was perhaps the best actor in the movie.  I have seen him in other films so I know this wasn't his acting high point. I would have to blame the director and/or the writer for this.  Walker had his moments, but there were some very lame ones too. There were too many points in the movie that left me hanging. Diesel's character and the leader of the Asian gang exchange some words early on in the film which builds the tension and the excitement for the rest of the movie.  The whole time I am thinking that we are going to see a hard core drag race match-up between the two characters- and we never do.  We see a fist fight between them, but it isn't what I wanted.  It wasn't what the film pumped up.  The final scene was just about pointless and useless for the film.  Nothing was resolved. A drag race and a car is demolished.  Out of everybody, we know that one person is dead, another wounded, a couple MIA, and nothing is certain, or even hinted at what the future has for the two main characters.It had good editing, and good cinematography, but that can't make the movie. Bad acting, bad directing along with a bad script simply made the movie bad.  I give it a 5 out of 10, only because I wanted to see the cars, and wanted to see if it was going to get any better. I was really anticipating a nude scene, or even some more skin with Michelle Rodriguez, yet that never happened either. I was disappointed by her role as well, since I had heard all this excitment about her in the movie.",The Fast and the Furious

I happen to do track, and before my races, the quotes such as ""winnings winning"" and ""another one bites the dust(yeah i know its a song)"" really help me get pumped.  The soundtrack helps too And to prove i know a little something about movies...this movie is kinda like American Grafitti, its got music all the way through it supporting the plot.

I'm typing this while watching Tokyo Drift..... Oh yea the original crew was dope To bad Ja Rule opted out of part 2. I forgot about the villain in part 1 too I call him Remy. I love him from other movies .... Oh and YES that introduction to Sung Kang aka Hanz . I fell in love with him and been low key stalking him since. He's so cute.

481,WxMan_II,Fast and the Furious? How about Lame and Curious...,2,28 January 2002,"Well folks, I thought I'd see an entertaining film..  What I saw instead was The Fast and the Furious...  This movie should have been Gone in 60 Seconds, maybe it should have been put out of its misery with a Bullitt...  Hmmm, Deathrace 2000 would have been more humane...Anyway, I thought his movie would have brought back some of my own feelings of blacktop mayhem (hmmm, should I copyright that?  Blacktop Mayhem.... Could be next summers Fast and the Furious, eh?)...  Tooling around town in my turbocharged Daytona, sometimes I get the same feeling I used to get when my ground pounding '69 SuperBee belched fire and roared thunder from its 383 Magnum...What I got instead was a lame excuse to show a bunch of imported pocket rockets burning up the road...  The street race scene, supposedely a 1/4 mile race (but never actually stated to be such) took much, MUCH longer than the accelerated film speed would indicate.  Heck, it seemed like a full mile...  I've seen races at Belmont run faster than this!  Oh, wait, and we're supposed to believe that our hero is able to operate TWO computer interfaces for his fuel management system and GPS locator (okay, that's a joke, but hell, so is his movie) while he's blasting down the road at over 140 mph, FOUR abreast!  Not me, baby, I'm gonna have MY eyes glued to the road and those OTHER idiots!I almost, ALMOST got interested in this movie when they started to try to develop a plot.  Okay, so Brian's a cop, he's undercover, and Dom and Trang are under suscpicion for truck hijacking...  The Feds are involved, they want the hijacking stopped before the truckers start arming themselves for vigilante justice.  Boys and girls, trucker vigilante justice (hmmmm, another nice phrase for a summer movie) would have been MUCH more entertaining - as witnessed by the scene when one of our hapless hijackers is pinned down by a faceless shotgun wielding trucker...OH, and wait... At the end of the movie...  Well, I won't spoil it (the movie itself does a passable job of doing that), our ""hero"" performs an action that is SO out of character, that is SO anti-reality as to cause one to sit in one's chair with his mouth hanging in disbelief...  Are we to actually believe that a cop, sworn to uphold the law, who's every movement has been scrutinized by not only his superiors and the FBI is going to act in the way he did after the final action sequence?  I think not.Save yourself a lot of grief and a little expense.  Do NOT buy this movie unless you see it on the $5.99 rack.  Wait for it to come out on cable... Trust me...",The Fast and the Furious

Although it obviously exaggerated the street racing scene, The Fast and the Furious presented a refreshingly different type of movie.

It was sold out, but we got into the 12:15am show time and the theater was packed! AT 12:15!! I don't understand what the appeal of this movie is. A bunch of fast cars? Fast cars does not a good movie make.The dialogue of this movie was terrible. There wasn't anything interesting said the whole time.  My friends (who LOVED the movie) tried to defend it saying that they talked like real people talk. Well, if I want to see real people talk I'll go to the barber shop or something; somewhere where I don't have to pay $8.25. Such lines as ""It doesn't matter if you win by an inch or a mile, winning is winning."" and ""I'll have the tuna fish,"" are the most memorable, and believe me they really sucked.The plot hardly got in the way of the blatant attempt to make a movie just for the reason of a bunch of cars going really fast. And audiences couldn't WAIT to see a bunch of cars going really fast. Maybe these people should watch NASCAR or something, then they won't have to worry about ignoring some piddly plot. If you want to see a GOOD movie with cars see Bullitt.Who hired these actors? ALL of them were terrible especially Vin Diesel who sleeps through the movie. My guess is they spent so much money on the cars that they could only afford to hire fifth rate actors.I gave this movie a 2 out of 10. The only reason it didn't get a 1, is because of the cars, if the scenes with the cars were surrounded by something that didn't make me want to ride the bus from now on, then maybe it could've gotten a higher rating.",The Fast and the Furious

to whoever said the dialogue is bad, it's supposed to be! it's street lingo, not proper english! vin diesel was absolutely awesome. the role of dominic toretto fits him really well. of course, he's sexy too but let's not forget his talent. he is one of the most talented actors in hollywood. paul walker is awesome, he's hot and also talented. michelle rodriguez is the bomb! she just rocks! she's a kick butt chick and the role of letty fits her real well. jordana brewster is also awesome, she plays her part really well.
to whoever said the actors couldn't act, well think again. i rented the DVD and went back to the store to buy it. the bonus materials are great, especially the making of the movie and the music videos. this movie explains the whole street racing world really well and they got great cars!
i also liked johnny strong who played leon and chad lindberg who played jesse. matt schulze (vince) was awesome, too. he played the part really well.i saw this movie practically 10 times and would continue to watch it over and over and over again. i would never get tired of watching it.  i recommend this to anyone. this movie absolutely rocks!i liked this movie 'cause it's not all street racing. there's a bit of drama and some funny situations. there's dominic who explains how his dad died, paul walker who's undercover and falls in love with mia (jordana) and letty whose boyfriend is dominic. i'm telling you if you haven't seen this movie, rush to the video store and buy it--don't rent it.""What do they plan on racing with, hopes and dreams?""

I thought him and Mia were gonna get married but they didn't. It also had a lot of hot girls. They always do. But I was surprised it was rated PG 13. I thought it should've been because of the profanity. But it was great anyway. But the film wasn't really about Dom. Mostly about Brian. If this wasn't good the furious series never would've started.

It's two hundred other movies, all done better, even by Keenu Reeves in such 'classics' as Point Break. It's to be assumed that this flix was not attempting intellectual or spiritual growth from the audience only the hard 'fast' world of cars and pretty girls in a simple fuel injected plot.Trouble is, that it was a bit on the shallow side as far as hard racing and high end 'furious' motions. Though, the one and only street race scene with Brian O'Conner (LEAD: Paul Walker) does an excellent job of conveying speed and the slightly warped view of the world street racers bring to the race scene.  Rent it ONLY for this scene.I would say more about the car chases later in the film, but I don't want to spoil any plot info.

It did have a reasonable plot, and what it was lacking for in plot it made up for in character development.  It had style and great actions scenes.  The story never got boring, and I stayed interested until the end.  I am sure that eveyone leaving the theater with me wanted to burn rubber as they drove home. (The difference being, I can, in 1st, 2nd, and 3rd!) What is lacking in this movie is any intelligent explanation of the science behind the speed.  Throughout the movie we learn 2 things.  1, nitrous makes a car go faster, and 2, you have to press the button at the right time.  I dont think I ever heard anyone in this movie mention the size of the engine for any of the cars raced.  Diesel, who again does a great job - contrary to those who assume big muscles mean no brains and automatically pan him - does give a top to bottom on his father's car, but it is never raced.  I guess we have to assume these are basically japanese compact cars that are painted nicely and mod'd out to the max, and that's the only reason they come close to matching the speed and power of classic street-rods. Still, I really would have liked there to have been more explanations of why Car A is faster than Car B, and known why Car B's driver needs to use his wits to win. Of course, the writers must have known, it doesnt really matter.",The Fast and the Furious

What is it? An awesome, entertaining ""movie"". I think we need to take a moment here to look at what is going on here. Most critics are always looking for a masterpiece, or an epic. Movies like Gladiator, which are amazing, but not all movies have to be like this. This movie is meant for sheer entertainment, that is all. If you smile, get into the story a little, think the action kicks ass, and have an all around great fun time, then I think it's a good movie. That's what has happened here. I went to see this movie knowing its a hated piece of work. I mean, look at its raiting on IMDB-4.5/10. That's pretty bad. I think this is a movie that most people won't like. There is a certain crowd that will, and if you like the movie, you're in that crowd. Let me give you a list of the best parts of the movie:Vin Diesel: He is like Arnold for the Millenium. He ROCKS!!!The hot chicks: They are all over this movie, we even get a little girl on girl kissing!The cars: I'm sitting in the theater drooling over the amazing race cars in this movie.The action: It's intense, and NON-STOP.So, do you like those things I just listed? Well then, The Fast and the Furious is a movie you HAVE to see.Let me say it again: The Fast and the Furious is something I haven't seen for a long time. It's pure entertainment.

507,baugust1,Incredible!,10,24 June 2001,"Being a part of the import scene, I was extremely nervous about the release of ""The Fast and the Furious"".  Visions of riced-out Civic's running 7 second quarter miles danced through my nightmares for weeks on end.  We even went out and rented The Skulls (with Paul Walker) and Pitch Black (with Vin Diesel) just to see what the acting was going to be like.  We had already seen The Faculty, so we knew what a hotty Jordana Brewster was.You cannot imagine my relief on opening night, as we emerged from the theater.  IT WAS INCREDIBLE!  There were very few ridiculous antics to be seen anywhere in the film.  My beefs are as follows:Civics driving under big rigs.  Totally unrealistic.  But come on, this is Hollywood.  It looked cool, just let it go.They lead you to believe green non-turbo Eclipse is turbocharged.  Anyone associated with the industry knows all about that Eclipse.  It has been in magazines and is well documented.  The film makers even admit to the fact that it is a non-turbo, yet still proceed to tell you it IS turbocharged and even dubbed in blow-off valve noises when it shifts.  But again, its a MOVIE.  We have actors pretending to be things they are not, so what is the difference if they pretend the car is something its not.Paul Walker's acting.  From time to time in the movie, he really nails a line and conveys incredible amounts of emotion.  (Like the scene where he and Dom are eating lunch alone together)  But other times his delivery is just plain flat.  (Like where he offers up his pink slip to race)  If you just focus on the acting of Vin Diesel (which was just awesome) you should be able to overlook Paul Walker's short comings.They had to bring something illegal into it.  Well, apart from the fact that street racing is illegal in the first place, that is.  I am sure there is someone, somewhere, who street races and IS in fact a criminal.  But the way it is portrayed in this movie is just ridiculous.  But again, this is Hollywood we are talking about.  If there was nothing like that going on, there would be no plot.  Just be happy its not drugs.Nitrous Oxide was over used.  Especially on turbocharged cars.  Anyone who has ever tuned a turbocharged car knows that it is no small task. Maintaining a safe air-fuel ratio while maximizing power is tough.  Adding nitrous-oxide into the mix (which requires additional fuel to go with it) is damned near impossible.  Only the top of the line professional racers pull it off as a large power adder and do it safely.  The fact that almost every car in this movie has both a turbocharger AND nitrous is just ridiculous. HOWEVER.. with that being said, it definitely adds something to the suspense of the race scenes.  It gives the director the ability to make someone appear to be losing a race, and let them hit their NOS button at the last minute to start a come back and make it close.  So although it is a bit unrealistic that so many people would run nitrous oxide, it adds entertainment value to the film.So thats it!  The movie was extremely well done.  The editing is great, and there are some parts that really keep you on the edge of your seat.  It is by no means predictable, either.  There are many parts of the movie that could really go either way, and the director does a great job of keeping you in the dark until the scene ends.  The interaction between Brian, Mia, and Vince was great too.  You could feel the love Vince has for Dominic and his crew, and that he really feels he is protecting them from Brian.The characters are believable, and you really find yourself caring for them and what happens to them.  The action is great AND believable (if you can overlook a few minor things).GO SEE THIS MOVIE!  In fact, I am about to go see it again right now.",The Fast and the Furious
508,wpkolkho,Not a complete waste of time,2,10 September 2016,"""The Fast and the Furious"" is not a good movie, but I must admit, I watched it all the way through.On the plus side, many of the actors and actresses are relatively attractive; Vin Diesel and Michelle Rodriguez are entertaining; some of the action sequences are somewhat entertaining; and the Dodge Charger is cool.On the negative side, the plot is silly at best. Brian lacks any credibility as a law enforcement officer, as do his silly ""superiors,"" and his motivations for anything other than spending time with Mia are a mystery. Dom's motivations are a mystery as well. I suppose the audience is supposed to believe that although he's something of a master criminal and has invested himself in a life of crime, he's OK with lying, and deceit, and police infiltration...Also, the characters lack development. Characterizing them as multi- dimensional would be generous; many cardboard cutouts are more interesting. Lastly, the dialog is entirely lacking in authenticity.I suppose some might think the cars are cool, although I don't know who those folks might be-- perhaps those that dream of nitrous oxide injection systems, and of spending tens of thousands of dollars on cars that sound like angry gnats...If you're looking to fill a couple of hours of your life with a mindless, nonsensical, semi-coherent action movie, this may be the perfect choice. Otherwise, you could most likely find something more worthwhile to do with your time. ""The Fast and the Furious"" is not recommended.",The Fast and the Furious
509,AndrewHatch,what the hell was that?!,1,14 February 2002,"I'll tell you what ... THE worst movie ever made.  I can't even believe I paid the $5 to rent this piece of DVD-Trash and I feel even worse for those who paid much more to see it in the theatre.Where to begin, where to begin.  Why not start with the plot, since people here keep saying it doesn't matter.  Okay okay, so there actually was no plot, but that's not going to stop me from ranting.  This movie had no focus or direction.  In the beginning it's this kid wanting to be a street racer. Then he's a cop trying to stop an electronics theft ring. Then it's some half baked attempt at a love story ala Romeo & Juliet with the kid and the family who doesn't accept him. Then it's a story about ripping off some truck.  Oh ya, and the occasional car race.  And as if that couldn't get any better, this movie even comes complete with an evil Chinese syndicate(could we get any more stereotypical????).I guess I should talk about the cast now.  Um ... ya, what an amazing cast of stellar bad-actors.  Yeesh!  Although I suppose it's not all their fault (well, except for Vin Diesel), most of the blame belongs to the awful script and terrible dialogue.  I watched Jordana Brewster for 3 years on As The World Turns, she's a good actress.  She was great over on ATWT.  But here... the height of her performance is the frequent use of ""Stop the bulls&@% !!!!"".  Paul Walker, he may be good, he may not be.  You can hardly judge by this movie and I havent seen him in anything else.  To me, it seemed like a classic case of casting based upon looks.Speaking of bad dialogue.  The absolute worst element in this movie was all the male ego BS.  The worst example of this was the ending scene with Paul Walker and Vin Diesel.  Paul Walker's character, the cop (just thought I'd reiterate this) was chasing down Vin Diesel's character in one of the movie's few car chases.  Diesel's car is smashed into by a truck and the car's totaled.  Walker pulls his gun on him and looks like he's going to do his job and arrest him.  But what does he do?  Hands him the keys to his car and says ""I still owe you a 60 second car"" and lets him ride off.  Then the movie ends.  Hopefully, what we didn't see was Walker's character suspended from the force, followed by a hearing, followed by an arrest and sentencing for Aiding and Abetting.Now this wouldn't be a good review if I didn't mention the car stuff. Firstly I found it extremely annoying that this movie threw in so much car gibberish that the average movie goer like myself had absolutely no clue what was being said.  Second, the car stunts were few and extremely lacking in excitement.  How exciting is it to see a car go in a straight line?  Not very.  How exciting is it to see 5 cars try and rob an 18 Wheeler?  It probably was, but by that point in the movie I simply didn't care.  And also... if the truck driver is shooting at you with a rifle ... why are you still chasing him?  To save some redneck who most of the characters don't seem to like, and end up killing two of the people you do like?I could go on and on about the flaws and annoyances of this movie ... but I don't have the time.  I like action movies ... when they're GOOD.  But this was not good, not by a long shot.",The Fast and the Furious

The cars were supposed to be the big thing in the film. But all they do is spend a fortune on building up the car and then drag race it down a road. No turns, leaps, death-defying dives between city traffic, and no tense racing. Just hit the metal, and whoever spent the most money and had the most nitro wins.And the story made even less sense (what the hell is with that fight at the start?), the script seems to have never been through a redraft, and most of the actors were permanently comatose.

The needed improvement: The technology stuffs are too domestic and simple. I don't see other countries' street racers (Japanese, Europeans...) using nitros and decide a driver's ability on a straight line race but the states. If they can make the races from point A to B (non-straight line) and focus more on how handling tuning is as important as horsepower, the ability of the 'well respected' group leader and the undercover would become more persuasive. Conclusion: If you are a hard core racing fan, this movie could disappoint as it did to me. The movie plot is really poor.",The Fast and the Furious
515,cassidycane,The longest ad I've ever seen,4,22 January 2002,"I think I watched this movie for the same reason many others watched the movie: we wanted to see them fast cars. And there were lots of them. The drag racing scenes were definitely the best but after several of them it kinda gets annoying when you're sitting there wondering where the hell did these kids get the money for the cars. Finding out who's been behind the robberies is pretty easy to figure out as well.Ok cars were ok but the relationships between the characters was not believable. I don't think that Dom and Brian connected so closely as to warrant what happened in the end. And the romance between Brian and Mia seemed to have come from no where. I believed  Mia and Leon's love/hate relationship more.If you have time and money to spend or maybe you got a free coupon from blockbuster, go ahead and watch this film.

519,Jashhh,One of those underrated movies,9,5 July 2013,"This was an actual 'movie'. The sequels were just entertainment takes. People forgot about the actual contents of this movie.The main part of the movie is the trust-and-suspect-relationship between (undercover agent-) Brian and Dominic with his team. This is a red line in the movie and made you want to keep watching.Somewhere along the way, you lose awareness of Brian's mission and start respecting Dominic's team. You want Brian to get into the group and be with the beautiful cute girl. It is about 'the family'.It was also about Dom being a unique character who tells you about his past, his father's race, the 10-second-race story and all. It was exactly how a movie about cars, races and action should be. Simple but powerful and beautiful.This was all build up really well. In a cool traditional (unforced) way, we were introduced with cool cars, cool people, street-racing and stuff.Before the end, a series of events happened that made you very excited. These events that happened are somehow connected and brought a sort of realistic thrilling experience. Here, the acting skills were superb and the drama in the scenes were pictured in a pitch-perfect traditional way. Brian was a lot tougher here than in the sequels where he was like Dom's slave or something.It's beautiful to see Brian and Dom at the end: Brian betrayed him and should arrest him but instead, they do the 10 second-race and don't know what to think about each other. This race was one of the most memorable scenes in film-history. After Dom hits the truck and survives the air-spinning of his car, Brian gave him the keys of his car, his car that has just also finished the 10-second-race. So, he finally gave Dom a 10-second-car and by doing that, he officially shows that he is not going to arrest him anymore.Somehow, he knew that Dom should not be sent to jail all along, even though he appeared to be a trucker-thief after-all......",The Fast and the Furious

It was sold out, but we got into the 12:15am show time and the theater was packed! AT 12:15!! I don't understand what the appeal of this movie is. A bunch of fast cars? Fast cars does not a good movie make.The dialogue of this movie was terrible. There wasn't anything interesting said the whole time. My friends (who LOVED the movie) tried to defend it saying that they talked like real people talk. Well, if I want to see real people talk I'll go to the barber shop or something; somewhere where I don't have to pay $8.25. Such lines as ""It doesn't matter if you win by an inch or a mile, winning is winning."" and ""I'll have the tuna fish,"" are the most memorable, and believe me they really sucked.The plot hardly got in the way of the blatant attempt to make a movie just for the reason of a bunch of cars going really fast. And audiences couldn't WAIT to see a bunch of cars going really fast. Maybe these people should watch NASCAR or something, then they won't have to worry about ignoring some piddly plot.

He then discovers that it's the group that he has integrated himself with are the culprits.

526,scottdelcarpio,Review for film,10,29 October 2018,This film is very good the way the film was directed was amazing. the story line had a lot of plot twists. The camera work in the film is amazing it has a lot of exaggerated angles and a panoramic shots also. The part I like best about the film is that it has a great story line with a lot of action in the film. Paul walker in the film was not originally supposed to play the part of Brian but he did an amazing job at playing the part and he is now one of the most recognized actors from the franchise. Brian in this movie is an undercover cop who is trying to catch the group of people who have been robbing semi trucks and there are three suspects however Brian seems to think that Vin Diesel ( Dominic torreto) is not the leader of the group who is taking on the semi trucks until he learns towards the end of the movie. The movie is great and I recommend if you have not seen the movie watch it the movie does not disappoint.,The Fast and the Furious
527,user-3133,And guys accuse girls of watching chick flick! Definitely a guy flick,7,2 March 2006,"The Fast and the Furious is one movie I wouldn't go out of my way to see. And yet I have to be fair. When it first came out I took one look at it, and said 'No way Jose. That's one movie I just know I'll hate.' A few years later we rented it, and horror of horrors I enjoyed it. As a 16 year old girl (which I was at the time) it certainly does not fit my profile of film watching (I watch Japanese movies/ horror/ war films) in any respect, and yet I found myself actually caring about the characters however slick and bland they were. And no I don't fancy Paul Walker or Vin Diesel.Though it has a formulaic plot- cop infiltrates street racers, and learns its about friendship and respect, it made up for this with it's admittedly excellent chemistry between the stars, and the rather cool race scenes.Vin Diesel and Paul Walker turned in reasonable performances as the cop and gang leader, and Michelle Rodriguez was surprisingly watchable as Dominic Torreto's girlfriend.However what made the film for me personally was the element of pure good fun going on between Vin Diesel and Paul Walker. They weren't taking it seriously, there was no heavy philosophy, and if you plan to watch this movie you should just follow their lead, and take it as a mindless action movie with a good dose of fun.",The Fast and the Furious

529,gcarroll,Street racing at it's peak and good acting,8,2 July 2001,"This is a fast paced movie about illegal street racing.  There is an interesting sideline plot involving other illegal activity, but the cars and the acting are the real winners.  Portrayed in style the cars show us the subculture of street racing and a general love for speed.  Vin Desil just shines in this movie... If you haven't developed a love for his acting you will, he hasn't been in much but he has captured notice of even Speilberg. Flics: pitch black (decent sci-fi), broiler room (good illegal trading movie) and few others.  Most of the other acting in the movie is first rate which allows you to stay focused throughout.

530,shea-8,simplify things just a bit,9,21 February 2002,"One word...FORMULA. This is Hollywood. Break it down and it is simply a western plot with cars races substituted for drawing guns, 18-wheelers for stagecoaches, and a whole lotta ""this town ain't big enough for the two of us"". Anyone expecting an original plot must be oblivious as to the state of American film. Accept it for what it is and be fortunate that it is lacking in pretensions. It is not titled, ""leisurely-paced, intellectually stimulating plot with rice burners"". It is FAST and it is FURIOUS, delivering what it promises.The movie is founded in reality, whether the movie-speak comes across accurately or not; this culture exists across the US. Rent the DVD to read the article the script was conceived from and see more details about this particular group of people. The ability to take your mothers leftover civic and dump a few grand under the hood, resulting in power and freedom, unites many different races and cultural identities in the street racing world. Even within the one ?team? in this movie there are several different cultural groups identified including women, Latino, African-American, redneck, and WASP.Rob Cohen has succeeded in creating a movie where the cars are given life. They are characters in the film along with the actors. And for those complaining of realism, a majority of the cars used in the movies are real cars raced by their owners who were extras in the movie, thus, one must conclude that this must be based in some sort of mechanical reality?But hey, that's just my take on it.",The Fast and the Furious

So I went to see ""The Fast and the Furious"" only to find out it's a bad ""Point Break"" version, with car aficionados, instead of wave riders. True, there were some pretty good action scenes, but the movie in itself screamed ""Point Break"" with worse actors. The plot, the infiltrated agent, the gang, the girl... It was like a deja vu. If you like Point Break, don't see this movie. It will leave a bad taste in your mouth. If you don't like Point Break, you won't like this one either, since it's much worse.

533,Ethan-24,The Gift of Elegant Trash,9,28 April 2001,"Roger Ebert once wrote that there are ""good"" bad movies and there are ""bad"" bad movies.   But once in a while there comes along a truly ""great"" bad movie--a B-picture so desperately trying to claw it's way out of the confines of it's genre that you have to give it credit for nothing if not sheer guts.To call Rob Cohen's ""The Fast and the Furious"" a ""great"" bad movie is a heady compliment indeed.  There have been many attempts at films with similar subject matter that simply fall into the category of ""bad"" good movies (with Renny Harlin's recent car wreck ""Driven"" coming to mind as a picture of great means yet dubious end).  The tale of rival street racers in Los Angeles, ""The Fast and the Furious"" sets itself apart with a strong sense of style and thoroughly exciting racing sequences.In his past works, director Rob Cohen has displayed a journeyman-like quality behind the camera, making very professional, albeit serviceable films that have never been able to free themselves from the manacles of genre (""Dragonheart"" and ""Daylight"" are but two such examples).  But in ""The Fast and the Furious"" Cohen brings a heretofore unseen visual panache to the proceedings, turning a film that could have been a mindless exercise in action histrionics into an exciting, sardonic (yet admittedly still mindless) ride.The film worked for me on a very visceral level, and the expert camera and effects-work were aided by a first-rate sound mix that added a great deal of intensity to the whole affair.  Vin Diesel gives a performance that is all steely-eyed machismo and throaty growls in the place of syllabic speech. But it's a perfect fit for Paul Walker, who strikes all of the right chords in a role meant to register, I suppose, as Keanu-Lite.
Audiences will scratch their heads as motivations shift, loyalties twist, and logic is all but beaten into submission, but ""The Fast and the Furious"" is undeniably entertaining.  It is garbage of the highest order, a ridiculously fun pastiche of genres, stock characters, and well-made set pieces.You may be groaning at the film's idiocy, you may be cringing at it's over-the-top action, but I can almost guarantee that you'll have a smile on your face while doing it.",The Fast and the Furious

536,Benny T,The name says all,7,26 November 2001,"A few months ago this film burst onto U.S. screens with little or no build up, and became a huge success.With a virtually unknown cast and competition from movies such as Dr Dolittle 2, it made a large impact on the box office, reaching number one. As for the product itself, I was pleasantly surprised with the quality. The movie opens with a spectacular truck hijacking by a group of black high performance cars. The plot then follows the story of Brian, played by little-known Paul Walker, a young car parts salesman who is trying to ingratiate himself into a group of revheads in L.A. After initial resistance, he becomes the protege of their leader Dom, played by Vin Diesel, a minor celebrity actor whose biggest roles were in Pitch Black and Saving Private Ryan. The big letdown is the close similarity between the story and the movie Point Break, except the activity of surfing is replaced by street racing. Paul Walker is certainly no Keanu Reeves, but he doesn't have to be - the cars are the real items of interest in this movie.It happens that Brian is actually an undercover cop, intent on finding the hijackers. He must first prove himself to be a legitimately talented racer as his cover identity. Naturally there's the obligatory love interest for Brian provided by Dom's little sister.The stunts are extremely well staged, almost to the point of believing that they must be computer generated pictures.The races and car chases are totally exhilarating, such that you don't have time to pick holes in the plot or worry about the quality (or lack of) the acting or script. The soundtrack is completely occupied by either cars revving or full force rap/techno music - under no circumstances see this movie with a pre-existing headache - it will be 50 times worse afterwards! That said, I think the sound is wholly appropriate to this film.Make sure you stay until after the closing credits, because it's one of those movies where there's something more for the viewer.

550,Wipitvigils,QUITE POSSIBLY THE WORST MOVIE EVER MADE!!!!!!!!!,1,29 March 2002,"This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen.  The idea of street racing is cool, because I personally do it and I love it, but this movie totally blew it's potential.  Not only that, it's a huge rip off of ""Point Break.""  An undercover cop, trying to get the inside on these street racers who are suspected to be robbing 18-wheelers, while falling in love with the girl who is on the side of the street racers.  That rite there is a horrible plot and should've been tossed at the site of that garbage.  There were also many other things wrong with the film. First, you see the driver's using nitrous on their rice burning cars like 4 or 5 times in a single race.  That is almost not even possible because the Japanese cars they are using can't take that kind of pressure on the engine block.  They could last about 2 shots of nitrous, maybe 3, before their engine block blew up and/or cracked, or before you had to do a complete rebuild of the engine, both top-end and bottom-end construction.Secondly, when they race at the beginning, they do a mile long race, which no idiot would do because to determine the winner, all you really need to race is a quarter of a mile. And lastly, the movie would have been a tremondous amount better if they used AMERICAN CARS!!!!!!  All these ""new age"" racers nowadays try to supe up their Honda Civics and their Eclipse's, and none of them were designed to race and none of them could ever compete with the kind of power an AMERICAN CAR could put out.The only two cars in the film that are worth any respect are the Ford Lightning, that doesnt even see the drag strip, which is stupid considering that it does a 10 second quarter-mile which is damn good, and the Dodge Challenger, which THANK GOD is raced, cuz if it wasnt i would have killed myself, but sadly ends up being destroyed by that idiot Vin Diesel.  At that point, i was getting ready to cry, and then shoot myself, but luckily the movie ended.",The Fast and the Furious

For the critics who said it was just a movie about racing cars they couldn't have been more wrong.  The whole story line behind The Fast and The Furious was great, when you first watch it you are suprised to find out Brians (Paul Walkers) real job, and then the chase sceene at the end where Vin Diesel and Paul Walker are chasing Jonny Tran and his cousin through the town was amazing.

Boring, predictable, unoriginal; good-looking good guys, bad-looking good guys, really bad bad guys and really good bad guys. BORING as boring can be. The dialogue is so pathetic, one feels sorry for great actors like Diesel who probably were not allowed to change the dialogue and say it better. I CAN'T BELIEVE this film... I have to admit though that most of the actors are pretty good (should be especially hard with a dialogue that primitive and the film so predictable in every single moment.) Also, the last few scenes are much more dynamic and interesting and dramatic and have at least SOME degree of unpredictability (not like anyone wonders in the last few minutes about Brian and what he will do, huh?) Also, Jordana Brewster after an incredible start in The Faculty never got any good roles (I hope someone will make a Love Story remake - she would get an Oscar for that probably), but COME ON - one hears/sees Yale and her intellect in every sentence, body move, smile, etc. - what the... would this girl be doing as a waitress/homemaker to her driver brother? Anyway, I'm pretty disappointed but I don't think the film is bad - it's just average - nothing one would expect from these actors - would have been pretty good for category B movies. I hope Brewster and Diesel get better in picking scripts (or agents) next time. I still think they (and Walker) are really good actors. Good luck to them but not to the folks who made this film.

565,wilhp8,I was bias going into this movie,8,5 August 2009,"I was Bias going into this movie. I grew up in the 80's, so I love Muscle Car and TV shows and movies staring Muscle Cars, 1979 The Dukes of Hazard, staring The General Lee 1969 Dodge Charger, 1982 Knight Rider, staring KITT 1982 Pontiac Trans Am, and 1981 Cannon ball Run staring? I have to give it to the Black Lamborghini Countach. So to nobodies surprise my first car was a 1973 split bumper Camaro, that I still own today. So when The Fast and the Furious came to theater I refused to see this movie. I hated the idea of Tunner cars that much. It was not until about a year later that I was sitting at home up late one weekend when this movie came on HBO I was hoping this movie would board me to sleep but instead I stayed up loving every minute of this movie, so much so I later had to up grade the 350 in my 1973 Camaro with a 383 and when it came time for me to buy an new car I bought a 2007 Honda Civic.Why I loved this movie, the race scene were awesome like nothing seen before, it is amazing what they did with the camera angles, special effects and the sounds. The plot worked well with the race scene environment and yes it was stolen from Point Break another movie I loved. The movie relied on a good mix of both the action from the races and the emotions and history of the characters to keep the views involved, the main focus on Dominic, but giving enough of the other characters so the movie was not just all about Dom. Finally there were a lot of awesome cars, some were a little over done with graphics but they made up for it with the 1970 Dodge Charger at the end.All in all this movie is a great combination of a good plot, good character development, and great action and cool cars.",The Fast and the Furious

I happen to be one of the ones who loved it, I unlike many other reviewers, thought the dialog was written fine, Vin diesel is a good actor, and that a large amount of this movie's appeal is in how the car scenes are shot.In a lot of movies, when they try to throw cars into the mix, you get bored, the shots are too centered, it gets boring, every time they race the cars here, the screen shakes and gives me (and anybody else who loved this movie) an awesome rush.

567,SimonCornelis,Still the best of the bunch!,9,31 July 2015,"So I finally got around to seeing the 7th movie in the immensely successful Fast & Furious franchise. I am a big fan of the entire franchise, and even though the latest part (Furious 7) currently gets the highest ratings out of all, the 1st is still my favorite. It has a certain charm that all the sequels lack. As a movie on it's own, much has been said before: The story is rather shallow, it has plot holes-a-plenty and the dialogue makes you cringe, but if you like fast cars and action, you'll most likely enjoy this movie. Nothing new there. But I would like to point out why for me the original The Fast & The Furious is still the highlight of the franchise.First of all, next to being a movie buff, I'm also very much a car guy, and from that point of view I can appreciate The Fast & The Furious' efforts to try and portray genuine car culture. An aspect that for me has really been missing from the later additions in the franchise. Admittedly for the car-tuning community this movie probably did more bad than good, and car enthusiasts love to rip on all the technical mistakes in this movie, but compared to the later F&F movies, this one actually does quite alright. For example, when Dom (Vin Diesel) shifts his car (a Mazda RX7) into gear at the start of the first race we get to see an elaborate CGI sequence that takes us through the entire drive train of the car. It's a fancy gimmick at first, but re-watching this sequence some time ago I noticed that the engine of the car didn't have pistons. Instead it has rotors. The filmmakers actually took the time to research the fact that RX7's are powered by rotary engines rather than your standard piston engine. We don't see this kind of attention to detail in the later movies and for all it's technical mistakes the 1st Fast & Furious also gets it right in many places.But even apart from these technicalities, The Fast & The Furious has got more redeeming qualities. I find that the original Fast & Furious has the most believable characters compared to the other installments in the franchise. Here we have a group of high-school drop-outs, who grew up together doing their car-thing. They're clearly a close-knit group of friends (a family) kept together by Vin Diesel's leader/father figure. In this context Diesel's character and the entire ""I got family"" thing makes sense. This isn't so much the case in the later movies (especially 5, 6 and 7), where Dominic becomes this stuck-in-the-past guy going on and on about his so called ""family"" who are actually just a group of loosely associated characters that come together on occasion and then go their separate ways again. Don't get me wrong, the all-star ensemble is fun in the action-blockbuster franchise F&F has become now, but below the surface the original still provides most of the drive behind the characters 6 movies later.In a similar way The Fast & The Furious has the best ""bad guys"" from the series as well. I always found Johnny Tran and his gang much more intriguing than any of the other bad boys in the sequels. In every other F&F film the crew rises up against some mafia figure (Verone, Braga, Reyes, etc.) who is evil for the sake of being evil, and who's ultimate downfall is always underestimating this crew of street racers because, you know, they're just street racers, right? It gets rather formulaic. Johnny Tran on the other hand isn't this ultimate bad guy. In fact his actions are rather well motivated. He's not even looking for trouble, like he says: ""You stay away, I stay away. Everybody stays happy"". But then this Torreto guy shows up in his turf again, some guy steals his engines, his whole family gets raided by the police, and to top it off he wins a pink slip fair and square, but the guy drives off. So he's righteously angry and retaliates. Johnny Tran has a reason to be the bad guy, unlike those in later installments.Further more the dialogue is actually one thing that I like about this movie. For better or worse, this movie has become one of the most quoted movies among my friends and family. Like many have pointed out before, the dialogue (especially the tech-talk) isn't the best written, but unintentionally this also adds to the believability of the characters. Go to any car meeting and you're bound to hear guys talking like they know all about cars and engines, while in fact they don't. Just like Dom's infamous victory speech. A lot about this movie is all show and no go, but that's also very much the ""tuning"" scene it tries to portray, in such a way that by now this movie often feels like a time-document, an homage almost, to the ridiculous car-mod culture in those days.Lastly I think The Fast & The Furious deserves a an extra credit for the original score by Brian Transeau (BT). He perfectly captures the atmosphere of the film with his scoring, particularly taking influence from his groundbreaking debut album ""Ima"". The later films lack this quality especially whenever ""Ludacris"" is involved and the entire soundtrack is full of cheesy pop-rap/club music that really doesn't fit the style of the movies at all.So there you have it, 8/10 for the original Fast & Furious film. Well deserved and still the best of the bunch!",The Fast and the Furious
568,y-a-z3689,Too Fast & Furious for me,6,11 January 2013,"We are all tired of fast cars as a central plot, but this is where it pretty much all started. The Fast & Furious epitomizes Racing Movies. Granted, they aren't my favourite type of movies to watch, but this one really hits the nail on the head.Foolproof storyline, star studded cast (for it's time) and of course, testosterone. Fast and Furious reeks of it, but I can only take so much. Yeah sure it was moderate action but, whether this was before HD or not, the way the cars looks when traveling at super speeds were far to fake for me. It looked cheesy and the green screen was obvious. Plus the acting of some of the cast was sub-par. I mean, who would of though that putting Ja Rule in a film would be prosperous. Mediocre at rapping, what makes you think he would be auspicious for a motion picture.I can't ignore the giant pink elephant in the room so lets get right to it. Vin Diesel. The bravado that follows Diesel in ever film he appears in is present here. In one of the ending scenes where Paul Walker's character reveals something shocking, the look that was given by Dom (Vin Diesel) was chilling in every sense of the word. He definitely out shined the rest of the actors. But Johnny Tran (Rick Yune)really surprised me. He made for a very compelling antagonist and I really wish he was is in the recent Fast & Furious'. All in all, you must see this revolutionary racing film. It has it's flaws but what movie doesn't? But what do I know I'm just a 15 year old boy.~Caesar Drake",The Fast and the Furious

This movie I believe was very successful not only because during that point during the American culture Auto Tunning was reaching its peak but because of the actors selected.

578,first_person_shooter,It will leave you dazed and breathless.,9,16 July 2001,"It begins with a spectacular action scene where three Honda Civics execute a high-speed highjacking of a cargo truck, and from there, the action never stops. With The Fast and the Furious, director Rob Cohen seeks to capture and thrill the audience with a booming soundtrack and non-stop action, and he seems to have succeeded.The film follows officer Brian O'Connor as he infiltrates a street-racing gang in order to capture the drivers of the three enigmatic Hondas, which have been terrorizing truck drivers in Los Angeles. The gang is led by ex-racer Dominic Toretto. Toretto immediately takes a liking to O'Connor, while his gang seems a bit skeptic. Toretto's right-hand man Vince is O'Connor's main problem, as he suspects the truth about his identity from the very beginning.The plot is slightly dry, as the movie incorporates many typical aspects of other films of the genre. For example, there's the fact that Toretto is the only one to trust O'Connor. The rest of his gang except for, of course, Vince, quickly follows him. Then there's the whole falling-in-love-with-the-sister-of-the-guy-I'm-about-to-get-arrested subplot. And then there are your typical problems from rival gangs and the hero's attempt to prove himself by striking against them. Yet despite the many stereotypical aspects of the script, the well-developed characters and interesting relationships save the movie from becoming just another heap of typical Hollywood sensationalism.The movie features strong acting, as the actors work well together and compliment each other's performances. This is only Michelle Rodriguez' second major performance since her film debut in the independent drama Girl Fight, which was a hit at the Cannes Film Festival last year. Not just another bad girl, Rodriguez shows a strong acting ability, which is apparent in her portrayal of Lena. Vin Diesel is also a fairly good actor who seems to be climbing through the ranks of Hollywood. Best known for his role in the failed science-fiction thriller Pitch Black, Diesel sports a memorable attitude and strong screen presence that promise to make him a contender for future stardom. Opting to cast less known, yet strong actors instead of more commercially viable ones, Rob Cohen has created a well-rounded cast, which gives the movie its fresh attitude and memorable mood.Yet it is the action scenes that are the real stars of the movie. Featuring three races and four equally spectacular action sequences, the movie delivers fast and furious action from beginning to end. Accompanied by a rocking soundtrack, the action sequences are put together by flawless editing and elaborate stunts, effectively creating a maddening adrenaline rush in any viewer.A long time producer and Harvard graduate, Cohen has achieved success a director, with movies such as Dragonheart, The Skulls, Daylight, Dragon: The Bruce Lee Story (which he also wrote and starred in) and several episodes of the series Miami Vice. He is also a screenwriter and has had small roles in some of his movies. He plays a pizza delivery boy in The Fast and The Furious.Although the slight semblance of a plot does not make this something for the serious moviegoer, the relentless action more than makes up for it. Not too long and filled with fantastic cars and non-stop entertainment, The Fast and the Furious will leave you dazed and breathless.",The Fast and the Furious

580,Krystall_Mechelle,I loved it,8,1 February 2002,"This movie is about illegal street racing (people who build or design their own cars to race them) and how someone within the racing world is robbing truckers.  I am a fan of cars, racing, and all that jazz. So this movie was a great way of bringing this underworld to life. Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, Rick Yune, Michelle Rodriguez (even though her role was small) and Jordana Brewster gave a solid performance. The soundtrack was excellant with every scene. This movie is stellar if you love cars, racing, and music.",The Fast and the Furious

Well ever time you watch this movie it will take 2 hours of your life. WORST ENDING TO A MOVIE EVER. I mean what happened to the guy that got shot, what did he tell the FBI, what about his girlfriend...did they hook up. Where did Dominic run to after he got his 10 second car. I could go on and on about how bad this was, but bottom line...dont see it. Go see something worth while like ""Army of Darkness"" or ""Tammy and the T-Rex"" !",The Fast and the Furious
582,rubach,Great movie!!!!,9,12 July 2001,It's a great movie but something in it reminds me of the old car theft movie with Charlie Sheen (29 seconds??). Doesn't know the English name for it. Not the line through the movie but some of the things that happen in it. Feels like the script writer took some help from that movie! But came up with a better movie!!,The Fast and the Furious
583,hootiefan,Don't take this movie too seriously(a classic!),10,31 July 2002,"When you watch Fast and the Furious, please don't take it as a serious work of drama.  Watch it as a mindless movie with fast cars and attractive women. With that said you would consider it a masterpiece.True, the movie has bad acting and poor story, but that is what makes it a marvelous popcorn film.  My friends and I spend hours mocking the film and its horrendous dialogue.  The movie is full of silly lines bound to make you laugh.  Just check the memorable quotes section.  There are so many classic scenes that make it a campy movie. Some scenes and dialogue is so ridiculous that it is too much fun to ridicule and imitate.  It so bad it's good. Plus it is very watchable because of the fast cars and hot girls.  I'm not sure if the filmmakers intentionally had the goal of ""so bad it's good"" but the cast and crew have made this into one of the best unintentionally funny films of all time.I urge each living soul to witness this magnificent work of art with an open mind and sense of humor.  You won't regret it.(Another note:  Ja Rule is terrific in this film.  He produces the all-time greatest cameo.  Unintentional or not it is a work of genius in the comedy department.  He is a pure delight to see him on screen.)",The Fast and the Furious
584,coreyg069,this movie is terrible,1,23 April 2006,there are few pieces of cinema that fail so spectacularly as this does. it's pathetic how bad this movie is. the plot is weakly written and the characters are poorly developed and the dialog is unnatural and awkward. do yourself a favor and stay away. I don't know why the makers of this film decided to go through with production on a movie with such limited appeal. it is without a shadow of a doubt one of the biggest wastes of time and money I've ever seen. all this movie did for me was call into question the quality of the acting ability for all those involved in this bomb. vin diesel is a terrible actor and this movie is bad even by his standards. paul walker as the undercover cop is hard to identify with. many of the roles in this movie are completely unrealistic and lame.,The Fast and the Furious
585,SupraTurbo,Comes at you Fast AND Furious,10,25 June 2001,"The Fast and the Furious comes at you like it says.  It's not a long movie and really never slows down much at all!  Those looking for a movie delving into a complex plot with in depth charachters need not watch it.  The movie is as the preview shows, a lot of great car chase scenes held together by a loose form of a plot.  It does what Gone in 60 Seconds only wishes it could do.  In gone in 60 you have 2 scenes with cars driving fast at all.  Here you have at least 6 or 7 distinctly different and memorable scenes. Although acting ability and some of the lines lack severely, this can be forgiven and is made up by the cars. This movie is perfect for anyone into speed and tuned import sports cars for the most part(yes, even the occasional despicable economy car made to ""perform"" is present)I saw the previews knowing this was going to be basically an adrenaline rush of a movie, and I gave it a 10 because that's what it delivered.",The Fast and the Furious
586,ddestiny987,Train scene Gets my vote,10,2 January 2002,"WOW! This was a Great movie. I thought when I first went to see this film that it was a guys film. I was wrong. It gives much appreciation to the meaning of CARS. There was some great action! Kept you on your seat the whole time! THAT train scene was gREAT! This movie was not hard to follow, With awesome action. makes you want to have a car like that. Highly recommend.",The Fast and the Furious
587,Auntikrist,What A Great Ride!,10,18 May 2002,"I had so much fun watching this movie that I went back 9 more times!  I made sure that I took different friends every time and none of them ever complained either.  Three of them were indifferent, but the other six said they honestly got a kick out of it the high energy, special effects, beautiful people and beautiful cars!I loved TFATF because it never pretended to be anything more than what it turned out to be.....  A great action flick with lots of speed and color. No one was pretending this was Shakespeare, but each actor gave his/her performance his/her best shots.  Yes, they are ""callow youths"" and the story was pretty much unbelievable, but hey!!  That is why I go to movies.  I go to suspend belief and be entertained and amused.  When I want to get intellectual and ""think"", I stay home and read a serious book.
I loved this lightweight piece of fluff.  It was great fun and I made sure to buy the DVD when it came out so that I can revisit the color, action and speed whenever I please.  God bless Rob Cohen, Vin Diesel, Michelle Rodriguez, and all those beautiful vehicular bullets in The Fast and The Furious!",The Fast and the Furious
588,swinger0071,Pretty Good If You Ask Me,9,22 October 2006,"i have seen the three movies; so i know what i'm talking about. although Tokyo Drift had the best story, i have to give it to One. it sparked the whole thingI'm down with the bad plot, even i felt that.but that doesn't stop the movie from being totally cool, it's as simple as that.sometimes, i think all i care about is racing scenes, but i see the dominant stuff in everything, and frankly, that movie was good although the before-credits end was a bit awkward and strange.the after-credits ending was cool too, except the ""I Live My Life A Quarter Mile / Hour."" line was somehow corny in my opinion",The Fast and the Furious

It isn't one of those stupid car movies like all the critics who haven't seen it think. I liked it most because it had a plot, it wasn't just all about cars, there was a point besides ""my car is better than yours."" It seems that way at first but there are lots of surprises that you would least expect, that was another good part about it as well. Although, the main thing is that the guys were hot, at least some of them. Just kidding:)",The Fast and the Furious

591,mwe069,OK the dialog sucks,6,26 August 2006,"I have to say the dialog is really bad. I line ""I live my life 10 seconds at a time."" one of the worst speeches I ever have witnessed on film. But to be honest, this movie was never about dialog. It's about fast cars and street racing.If this was a silent film, I'd give it a ten on the basis that the racing scenes are some of the best I have seen.Look, this film is purely about the cars, are a lot of the cars the same, well duh, of course they are. They are the fastest rides around. What do you want a Skylark or a delta 88 zooming around? They'd get buried.all in all this movie delivers.",The Fast and the Furious
592,c_flip,"The cars are fast, but the acting made me furious.....",1,11 July 2001,"What do you get when you take Days of Thunder, add in two younger actors, and two equally attractive young actresses, and then put it all on the streets?  A good idea.  However, the additions of such clueless individuals as Ja Rule, and many other small players made my head hurt.  The stunts were great, the cars were ""Pretty"" fast, and the women....nice.  The script, ohhhhh my god, it made me wish I was watching Prison of the Dead. Now....another question...What do you get when you have two bad actors staring in a movie with a horrible script?  Several things.  One, an unemotional reading of the lines on the screen which came across as totally bland and seemed like it was a cold reading.  Two, moments that were supposed to be funny, but just couldn't pull it off.  Third, same as the latter, but with emotional moments.  Fourth......one really bad and shameless plug....""You can have any brew you want, as long as it's a Corona.""  Ow! My aching head! Ow!This movie does not deserve praise, it does not deserve to be making the money it has been, and I want my two hours of living back that I wasted giving this film a chance.What have we learned from this? Well we learned that: ""I was in The Skulls."" and ""I was in Pitch Black."" ....are not impressive listings on one's resume.Don't waste your time....",The Fast and the Furious
593,ThunderChild,Thoroughly Enjoyable if you don't think about it,7,23 September 2001,"I thouroughly enjoyed this film. It had action in spades, a reasonable story and lots of fast cars. The actors aren't well known but that doesn't make it bad. The race scenes are very well done and the bit with the Honda Civics and the truck are class. Suspend belief. Forget thinking and enjoy it for what it is, not what it should be. 7/10",The Fast and the Furious

Out of ALL the car movies I have seen, this is BY FAR the best.Other people who have reviewed this movie said it's ""crap"", ""not worth you're money"", ""mindless and illogical"".  But some people just need to lighten up and turn on their ""action movie"" senses when they go to see an action movie like the Fast And The Furious, apparently they have their ""serious movie"" senses on.  This movie has great car scenes, is very true to life, some say it isn't, it is, and is a VERY fun movie to watch.The is DEFINENTELY the most awesome and kick ass movie I have ever seen, it isn't the best, but it IS the most awesome.  It is WELL worth you're money. No movie is perfect though...well...almost no movie, this movie has 2 little flaws.  #1.  All the cars were riceburners, they had 1 Ferrari, they needed more BMW M3's!!!!!  And #2.  The ending kind of leaves you wondering a few questions.  Vin Diesel is as good as he was in Pitch Black, a movie I HIGHLY recommend you see, ESPECIALLY with surround sound and the volume UP.  But I would give The Fast & The Furious a 99 out of 100.

I went into this film just for the pure action of fast cars. I was totally happy with the results of this film. This film had some of the best car chase/racing sequences I've ever seen. I loved the chase scenes in ""Bullit"",""French Connection"" and my favorite of all time, ""Ronin"". ""Fast and the Furious"" matches up pretty well with those great car sequences.

It had intense racing scenes and a decent storyline, especially for a summer action film.I'd seen the previews for the movie at some other films i'd seen, and was really looking forward to seeing it.  It was well worth the wait.  The only real complaint i have of the movie is that the plot, though decent, could have been better.

Fab effects, georgeous cars (nice to see some Europeans). The only drawback was that I couldn't see the bodywork for the 'body work'! Never mind girls... the split second of Vin w/out a t-shirt was worth the money. My other half wants it on DVD. Unlike Pitch Black, I think I'll be bored at the third view. '...Fast and ...

This movie was made for one reason alone - pure eye candy.  I didn't care about the plot holes and unrealistic action sequences, etc.  I, like most other people, went to see some cool cars and races.  Others might go to see some good-looking young actors (Paul Walker, Vin Diesel, Jordana Brewster, etc.).  What kind of moron expects a plot or fine acting from this type of movie?  It's a movie.  It's fantasy.  Just accept that and enjoy.",The Fast and the Furious

People, this is not American Beauty or Magnolia. It's a car movie. Thus, when preparing to see such a movie, dismiss plot, character depth, and storyline as a non-issue. Then, if it turns out to have those things, you can be fairly amazed. If it does not, that is fine too, for you got to see a bunch of beautiful cars going at high speeds on city streets, which was well and often pulled off in the movie. If you can't deal with movies that aren't oscar contenders, don't see movies like this. jeez.",The Fast and the Furious

604,za_kenshin,Uhhh...can someone tell me where the good actors in the movie are?,3,30 January 2002,"I was disappointed with this movie, when I wasn't watching the beautiful cars blazing through the streets; which, by the way, there weren't enough of.The first problem with the movie was definitely the cast. Vin Diesel committed career suicide (in my eyes) by acting, or should I say taking the spotlight, in this movie. I'm a fan of Vin Diesel, mostly because of his role in ""Boiler Room"". But who the hell let Paul Walker into this movie? If it weren't for his looks I don't believe he could have made it into the acting business; there is no discernment between his character in this movie, and all of his others. While I was watching ""The Fast and The Furious"" I had to check and make sure it wasn't ""The Skulls"" or one of the other extremely terrible teen movies he's been in. He is not an actor, all he does it say his lines from a script written from him...but where was the heart in his performance(if you could call it that)?This movie was so terrible that the second time I tried to watch it, suggested by a friend who came over the next night, I fell asleep. The plot was so thin I thought I was watching a bunch of Anorexic(SP?) teen movie ""stars"" trying to make themselves look like actors.The only other decent actor I could find in the movie was Rick Yune, whose part was not nearly emphasized enough... poor Rick. But for the racing scenes, I thought they were great... every time I listen to The Crystal Method I feel like hopping into my friend's Honda 2000, cranking up the NOS and heading for a straight stretch.I give this movie only a three. In fact, it only got the three BECAUSE of the cars, the races, some of the music, and the few beautiful females. It could have received a four... but the the females had to keep their clothes on. I don't suggest anyone with a need for some intellectual stimulation watch the movie, unless you're extremely high or in need of material to make fun of.  For those of you who really loved, and got caught up in this movie...man, it isn't even worth my time to scold you.",The Fast and the Furious
605,fethrlght,YES! Modern movie making had reached a new low!,3,16 January 2002,"Why I let my friend drag me to this movie I do not know. I guess I was bored and had absolutly nothing else to do. Its strange that the weekend I came into school after seeing this all people were talking about was this movie, PATHETIC. It really reminded how low people's look on movies are today. Plot was a cliche linear ""thing"" about some racer ""thiefs by night"" and the cop trying to stop them. Dialouge was terrible and people who say the cast was fine don't have any idea, Sean Connery and Brad Pitt couldn't save this movie in lead roles. Except then we'd have decent acting. The only reason I brought myself to giving a three was for 1. The Cars, (I know, that goes against what I was saying, but the stunts were well done, and 2. The floresent lights under the cars because it made we want to put a pair on my car. Besides that the most disgusting part was how many people liked this, dear directors and writers, PLEASE think of something serious that we can watch!

If you are the kind of person that has less than 5 brain cells and likes ogling hot chicks or fast cars, then you might get some enjoyment out of it, but if you have the intellect past that of a 5th grader, then I hope to God you're mature enough to realize how much of a crock this movie is.",The Fast and the Furious

609,lacorte,Great adolescent speed flick.,5,4 March 2002,"The Fast and the Furious was full of action and adventure - it's just that it was all very implausible with all these young men driving very expensive cars and betting their pink slips on one race. Yet, the main character Paul Walker is driving these expensive machines while deriving his income as an auto parts delivery boy! If I were to rate this movie on action/adventure alone it would warrant a 7-8, but then if you only watched movies for that aspect you should just rent any generic van Damme movie. Somewhat original depiction of the Japanese cars mod craze where cars are chopped and modified by teens to inject some sportiness into bland Honda Civics. Because of the originality of the cars my 14 year old son was glued to the TV waiting for the next ""sweet"" machine to emerge. If you like cars and fast driving scenes this is a movie I'd recommend, but the theme is highly implausible and the hijack scenes are borderline Jackie Chan.",The Fast and the Furious

If you want to see fast cars you can just go to a NASCAR race or something. There was absolutely NO PLOT in this stupid movie. Just fast cars.

And I must credit the film makers with taking a movie plot which I thought sounded, let me be blunt--stupid and turning it into a movie that was at least able to entertain me.

614,MACarter214,My Most Hated Film,1,4 April 2008,"Normally I don't comment on films that I knew I wouldn't enjoy just by seeing the trailer. But I was reminded of this atrocity when I recently saw a news blurb about another installment of this franchise and remembered when I saw it for the first 5 times. I was serving in the Navy back in 2002 and our IT department ran a channel shown on the ship that shows movies. Apparently, someone thought it would be a good idea to show this film over and over.This movie manages to be offensive on so many different levels that it boggles the mind and violates it at the same time. The plot is unoriginal and base, the dialog is poorly written and poorly delivered, the editing is like an epileptic seizure, and yet somehow it is overglossed and shined up. Kinda like a polished turd.And as if the film wasn't just badly acted and written, it also manages to offend just about everyone with an IQ above a 10 year-old who views it. I'd say it's misogynistic, but there are no women in this movie. There are material possessions that resemble women, but when their function is to be placed on the hoods of cars for decoration, won in races, or used against other men for position, than basically you've turned once promising actresses into blow-up dolls with heartbeats. There's also plenty of racial stereotyping. Whites, Hispanics, and Asians frequently insult each other based on skin color, but hey, that's hip, yo! But I'd have to say this film is more insulting to me as a man. If you believe this movie, then all men are insecure, materialistic blowhards who are in constant competition and serve only to one-up each other. Whether who has the faster car, who can break the law more, or who can get closest to the ever elusive ""menage a trois."" And what's sad, is that I've seen so many trailers for films that seem to ape this MTV culture of immaturity, faux-machismo, and flash-zoom editing since that basically make this the culmination of all that is bad in films today.I try to see the good in all movies, and if I can't, then I just say ""it's not my thing, but if someone else likes it, good for them."" This is the ONLY film I cannot let off the hook. It is unforgivable and I loathe its very existence.",The Fast and the Furious
615,Destiny_Brent,Amazing!,10,20 May 2002,"This movie had some strange appeal to me when I first saw the advertisments. I'm not a car person really, and I definately prefer a movie with a plot over action sequence after action sequence. But when I went to see this movie I was blown away! It was beautifully done, from the edge of your seat rush of the racing sequence to the excelent plot.Normally movies like this have no psychology to their characters, and though that wasn't the main focus, this movie did pull off having convincing and entertaining characters. It gave us a look at friendship, and showed us a whole other world not often portrayed in movies! Vin Diesel blew me away, a great talent I hadn't formerly seen.An excellent piece of cinema!I gave it a 10 out of 10.It pulled off exactly what it set out to do. It may not be one of those Oscar winners, but it wasn't meant to be. It was just a fun movie.",The Fast and the Furious
616,SweetAsCherries,I enjoyed it...,8,6 June 2002,"Okay, here we go.  I like to consider myself and intelligent individual, so when I was reading comments I was surprised to see such things as "" if you have an IQ of over 80 stay away from this film"" and other comments like ""the film spent too much money on the cars and couldn't afford good actors"" (or something to that notion...).  I personally am the type of person that appreciates a good film with a good story line, great actors, and deep underlying concepts.. but give me a break.  Not every movie is made for that reason.  The reason I enjoyed The Fast and the Furious is quite simple... it has something for everyone... well, almost everyone, there are always the people who can find something wrong with it.  It has fast cars, actors people like to see on the screen along with some fresh faces, characters that people identify with, and an action packed storyline.  What more could you want?  Some say the dialogue wasn't so great... okay, what exactly would you say when you wanted the tuna fish sandwich?  The dialogue fit in with the situations they were in... you couldn't expect more.  So, to sum it up, I liked the Fast and the Furious for the simple reason that it was an enjoyable, action packed film with likeable actors and dream-like cars.",The Fast and the Furious

Some of the dumbasses I know have tried in vain to defend this crappy film by using excuses like ""the car chases were cool and the chicks were hot!"" If I want to see car chases I'll just watch Nascar and if I want to see hot chicks I'll just pick up a victoria secret catalog, and then I won't have to sit through an insufferable piece of crap that's not even worth the film it's printed on.",The Fast and the Furious

621,nicksd05_02,Watch it for what it is,7,21 January 2003,"Hey, This is a good movie for what it is trying to be, an action movie.  If you want a complicated or twisted plot, watch something like Memento.  If you want fast-paced action, and sweet cars that you won't see in any other flick, watch the Fast and the Furious.  When did an action movie have to become something worthy of being the subject of essays in high school classes?",The Fast and the Furious
622,Marcelia,So boring...,1,27 February 2003,"Why do they make movies like this? What is the point? This movie is about nothing. It´s for people who like: cars (who like cars more than movies), V. Diesel, simply (maybe no) plot and wretched dialogues. I like none of this..1 out of 10",The Fast and the Furious
623,cooper1-318-937211,Great great film!,8,19 March 2012,"I gotta say, I love this movie, and the stunts are really amazing. Special FX include cars driving under speeding trucks and staying in control, plus a wheelie from a dodgy corvette.Anyway the film was Dynamite!!!! The story of the lead guy being undercover and gaining the trust of the crooks is quite good but here it could have been better. There was one moment I will remember above all and it's the moment that I reckon was the most tense in the entire film. Most people won't remember it but I just happened to. Anyway I won't give any details but basically it's when he blows his cover to the lead crook. The look on the bald guy (Vin Diesel)'s face gave that scene more suspense than any other. But then it's just wasted after that.The film ends with us perhaps not knowing what will follow but it's not hard to work out what probably would have done if it were continued a bit longer.The acting was very good. That Vin Diesel bloke was criticized by a lot of people on this site but there's a bit where he talks about his dad's death and i thought he shined then. And the others weren't that bad anyway.Overall the film is worth a watch if you're looking for a little action that's easy on the mind. Of course it goes without saying that if you like cars this film is for you.",The Fast and the Furious
624,wayne-cook-326-133712,The legend that started it all!,10,27 March 2012,"""The Fast and the Furious"" is a great, great action movie. Love Vin and most of the others, with the exception of Walker. You can see why they are working on Pt 6 now. Booyaaaaaaa!!! If you're into action and drama, then you'll love this movie. The racing scenes are very cool, and the in-your-face action keeps you on the edge of your seat. It entertained me throughout the whole thing, and I'd have to say the acting is a lot better than said by others to be.. The only one lacking to me, was Paul Walker, and, well, we've always known he wasn't much of an actor.. just a pretty face. However, the rest of the cast did an awesome job. I highly recommend this movie.",The Fast and the Furious
625,Frasse_m,Entertaining rip-off,7,24 February 2005,"I saw this movie yesterday and quite enjoyed it. It is a film with a lot of action and high-speed driving (no surprise there). After seeing it I realized that I had seen it before. Actually the story is a little too much like Point Break, but with cars: Cop infiltrates a gang, falls in love with a girl in the gang, becomes surprised that the gang is actually the 'bad guys' he is looking for, chases the 'bad guys', lets the biggest bad guy free. Even so, the film is entertaining and is worth seeing, if only for the awesome car driving. It could be interesting to compare this movie with the sequel. I actually saw the sequel before and I think it is at least as good.",The Fast and the Furious
626,O0o0O,Hondas suck... And so does this movie...,1,3 February 2005,"Movies that rely on subcultures and pop culture are generally the bottom of the barrel... the Fast and the Furious does nothing to change this it only makes me want to vomit. The average joe will watch this and enjoy because the average joe likes Hondas with NOS and pink neon. I cant stand to see the the tuner culture exposed in such a way that glorifies the idea of throwing tons of cash into cars with little to no potential. This film grossly augments the ability of a V-TEC and NOS. Yeah, okay this film was not supposed to be realistic but it is so ridiculous that I can't even pretend to enjoy. The plot is this: an undercover cop tries to bust a theft ring by entering the underworld of compact car racing. The cop meets people, races, and tries to look cool... it is horrible to watch...painful. The plot is ho-hum the acting is humorous and the races are bullcrap. At one point there is a supra that races a Ferrari...and wins. like I said before this is too ridiculous to praise. If you are a NOPI dork who runs around claiming your civic has 600 wheel horsepower and runs a 8 sec. 1/4 mile with the 400 pounds of speaker equipment then watch...",The Fast and the Furious

Watching it now....you would think that this was a straight to video production. Any scene that involves Paul Walker is just cringe worthy. People always give Keanu Reeves a bad wrap for his acting abilities, but Paul Walker is just terrible in this movie. The only saving grace is the action sequences. I also enjoyed the big brother subplot between Dom and Brian. The acting is what brings this movie down for me.

Not that Point Break is ""Raging Bull"" or anything, it's just that this movie (Fast and the Furious) tries SO HARD to make sure that ALL THAT ATTITUDE is RIGHT IN YOUR FACE. Point Break at least had a little laid back surfer dude 'tude to it (although, we finally figured out that Keanu wasn't actually ACTING in that movie). Plus, Fast and the Furious lacks that world class quote a la ""I. am an EFF-BEE-YI A-gent. I. CANNOT. ROB. a BANK!"" The best The Fast and the Furious can muster is ""If I win, I get the money... AND the respect. That's more important to some people."" Wow. Thanks for spelling that out.",The Fast and the Furious
630,hembreedg,One of my favorites films of all time,9,9 October 2018,"The Fast and The Furious 
 After watching every single Fast and Furious movie in the series thus far, I can say for sure that the very first original Fast and Furious movie is still the best. The story goes from undercover cop trying to find illegal street racers robbing trucks of millions of dollars in electronics to the undercover cop growing close to the racers and trying to help them get away from the cops.
 This movie is very fast paced and an in your face thrill. The stunts they do with the cars are incredible and keep you very engaged and waiting for what's to come. All of the characters in the film are easy to relate to and makes you wonder which character you would be if you were in the film. The best duo is Vin Diesel and Paul Walker. In the beginning they are enemies hunting each other but by the end they are good friends helping each other out.
 Being a car guy myself, I have always loved car movies but this one just never goes away. I'm not sure if it's the action-packed scenes filled with police chases or the realistic street races that keep you on the edge of your seat. Although there are some insane car stunts in this film, the street races are very real and show how sometimes street racing goes good and sometimes it goes horribly wrong.
 The only thing about this film that I didn't like was some of the cars. Nearly all of the cars used were your typical European import cars. They could have branched out to some cars that many people don't see as often, and I would have been even more interested in the cars.
 There is truly something for everyone to enjoy in this movie even if you aren't a car person. There is thrills, action, love, hate, adrenaline, and a little bit of everything. I have watched this film with lots of different people and I have yet to hear any of them say they didn't like it because they can easily connect with one of the characters.
This movie got me hooked on horsepower at a very young age and still to this day whenever someone asks me what movie I want to watch, I always say The Fast and the Furious. Every time I watch this movie, my adrenaline starts pumping every time there is a racing scene and by the end I just want to go jump in car and race! 
All in all, this is one of my favorite movies of all time and I will never get tired of watching it. I highly recommend this film to anyone, especially if you like street racing and/or import cars.",The Fast and the Furious

A plot would just get in the way of ""cars going dangerously fast down city streets.""  There were no notable quotes. There was no notable acting.

If you like cars, street racing and watching a movie to see the cars only we can dream about this is it. Plus, these aren't fifth rate actors, because they spent money on the cars.

I loved how the movie allowed the viewer to create their own ending for themselves, and how Dominic Toretto being the villain was such a surprise. I really believed the hi-jackers were Johnny Tran and his gang!!! I would have never expected The Team.  The love between Brian Spilner and Mia Toretto was an added twist, giving the movie a lot more feeling to it then just fast women and fast cars.  Letty was great, she has an attitude that I totally agree with- it's time for the guys to take a back seat and let the girls show their stuff.  She also doesn't put up with crap from other girls when they are hitting on her man!!!  Leon and Jesse are great additions, Jesse being comical, but also being a very leading role in the whole situation.  Vince was a jerk, but without him, the movie would definitely not have been complete.  The cars were just sic, the effects and the drag racing making your adrenaline pump along with the characters'.

There was an expectation of gravity defiance in the race scenes, nothing really came of that until the end of the flick.  So, if you want a virtual rush, sleep until the end. THE BEST part of this flick is the acting ability in Vin Diesel.  Yes, this guy actually pulls this movie and you along for a good ride that ends with interest.

There was alot of hot cars, with god only knows how much money invested in them, driving around alot.  Driving fast.  I spent half the movie trying to figure out how these deadbeats could afford these cars.  Ok.  So, the good guy and the bad guy become friends.  The good guy doesn't want him to be the bad guy and tries to find someone else to blame for the crimes being investigated.  (I think that had something to do with the bad guys sister being the love interest of the good guy.)  I continued to watch this waiting for some kind of plot to unfold and then suddenly there was the end.  There was this very short climax that involved bad guys getting shot or shot at and lots of very expensive cars being mangled.  The main good guy and the main bad guy have a showdown.  Blah, blah, blah.  And then the good guy lets the bad guy drive off into the sunset.  We have no idea what happens to the bad guy in the hospital, the still living members of the main bad guys gang, or the (very upset betrayed feeling) love interest of the good guy, or even the very very young undercover cop himself.

In fact, this was one of the most boring movies I've ever seen.This movie is aimed squarely at a market of teenagers who add racecar decals, spoilers, and 4 exhaust pipes, to their 35mpg mom-mobiles in hopes that people will think they are cool. I'm also proud to announce that my '84 Volvo is apparently ready to go on hijackings using sophisticated equipment (thing that shoots a hook thing) and extensive planning (shoot the hook thing at the thing), as soon as I get myself a neon light or two and a dorky helmet. OH yes, and NOS!!!!!!!For help deciding if you'll watch 'the fast and the furious'... If you enjoy movies with a plot, or any other even remotely intelligent values (like adhering to the laws of physics) then this one's a no go, unless you enjoy making fun of things like the little Darias that you are. The special effects are mediocre, just because they either involve fire coming out of cars somehow, or cars flying through the air. They were doing that all the time in the 80s, you know. The characters... yes, they have some character development; By the end of the movie you know that they are all a bunch of losers with way too much money to spend on their Civics.

The actors weren't bad - the characters just weren't overly deep.That said, ask yourself why you watched the film. Was it for the undercover cop story, admittedly done a thousand times? Or was it to see THOSE CARS move? I think that that last, as the films focus, was done incredibly well, and the actors did a good job of being the varied and individual if somewhat cliched drivers, which is essentially what they were there for. I liked the story, but then I tend to like almost all stories, I'm very open minded.This leaves me to say one thing...I'm not THAT much of a car person, but after seeing this...I WANT MY CAR TO DO THAT!",The Fast and the Furious

665,blantonstogdill,Clearly some of you didn't pay attention to the ads.,10,23 June 2001,"See, here's the problem.  Most people are giving this movie bad reviews and comments because they went into the theater wanting too see character development and a deep, thought-provoking plot.  Since when did the producers and writers say that would be included?  This movie, or any of its type for that matter, was never about a heavy story.  Its about speed and adrenaline.  When I went to see this movie, I wasn't thinking I would leave the theater I marveling at the emotional ending, I expected to leave wanting to peel-out of the parking lot and get home in the fastest time possible, racing down the highway not caring about anything else.  That's what this movie promised and it delivered.  so to all of you who misunderstood the purpose of ""The Fast and the Furious"", I say next time, go watch a Disney movie or something and give me speed and thrills.",The Fast and the Furious
666,jaded_aero,Insanely Fast,10,25 June 2001,"This movie, has by far the best car racing scenes ever filmed, as well as the best cars. They are gorgeous machines, and these guys certainly can drive them. Great story, not just another Gone in Sixty Seconds where all they did was steal cars, there actually weren't very many race scenes as you might expect, but every shot is filled with cars, and lots of them. The acting is great as well, as usual Vin Diesel gives a brilliant performance, as Dominic Toretto. It has already earned a massive following, and when you leave the theaters you will be filed with such a massive adrenaline rush, that you and all your buddies will be left with the feeling that you must go out and race. Everybody I have talked to have said the same thing, it just has this crazy adrenaline rush it gives you. I highly recommend this to all fans of cars, and racing, but it has something for everybody so see it even if you are not a fan of either, bottom line, just see it!!!!!!",The Fast and the Furious

Acting was very good on Vin Diesel's and most others parts(especially Jesse), but some of the actors were lacking (Paul Walker, dont try to lower your voice, it doesnt make you look cool).

671,wiserurchin,A iconic Action Film,9,4 June 2020,"A movie that for its time was a first of its kind, Hollywood had never seen a movie involving illegal street racing. Little to everyone's knowledge that this first startup movie in 2001 would lead to a long and ongoing series of movies. Brian O'Connor (Paul Walker) Is a LAPD officer assigned to investigate Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) under suspicion of multiple high speed truck robberies. O'Connor quickly meets Toretto in the street racing scene, Toretto takes O'Connor under his wing and gives him a place to stay as well as helps him build a new car. Throughout the time O'Connor is with Toretto he falls in love with not only his new environment but also Toretto's sister. The Movie doesn't only portray the criminal activity like street racing, running from the police, and robbery of semis carrying Blu Ray Players but shows bonds being made between two completely different worlds and a true feeling throughout Toretto's group known to him as family. O'Connor works so well into the family that when it's time to step in and do his job to bust the family for the thefts he can't do it and feels like he's betraying the family. The movie is beriddled with effects from the early 2000s and at some point shows poor editing. The movie has many interesting little quirks that the average person watching the movie might not notice but to its intended audience of car guys shows. One recognizable scene that is laughed upon is the first race scene of the movie of the movie Brian goes to spray Nitrous Oxide into the motor and the passenger footwell floor pan just falls right out of the car. How those to relate or even nearly are possible is out there and foolish. Looking past its few small quirks and editing issues the film was quite a good turn out. The film was low budget and to the studio seemed like a one and done film but turned into something much bigger. A cool fact is the cars used in the film were cars built by actual people throughout the state of california. To wrangle up some car ideas they invited a large group or car tuners to bring down their car to the movie studio and from the directors chose which cars would star in the movie. The cast brought the movie together with good chemistry and put on an amazing performance with most not really being seen in any big buck films before. The Fast and The Furious for most was a movie that brought together the car community and created dreams for the members of all with this action movie. The movie would go on to make a total of 10 action packed movies. The Fast and Furious movie was and will continue to be an amazing movie not only for its action scenes but its depiction of street racing and the car community in the early 2000s which is largely the same today.",The Fast and the Furious

674,joseph-masterson,Point Break II,6,15 July 2001,"Potential spoiler review...Surf's up, dude.  Keanu Reeves reprises his role as undercover cop, Brian Spilner, turned racing demon in this fast and frenetic movie by the genius that brought us such classics as Miami Vice and 'thirtysomething.' Befriended by Bhodi, played by Vin Diesel, Spilner (Reeves) attempts to learn the identity of the Presidents of the USA who are stealing expensive electronic equipment.  Bhodi, the leader of a fast driving car crew that drag races for 2 grand or pink slips is Spilner, err Utah's ticket to cracking the theft ring.  Along the way Utah meets Tyler, Bhodi's sister played by Jordanna Brewster and Warchild (Rick Yune), the leader of a rival racing gang,  that helps to spice up the predictable plot.  Although the final chase scene doesn't involve airplanes and bleeding presidents, playing ""chicken"" with a train more than adequately substitutes.  As the movie ends, Bhodi hops in his new 10 second car (you'll understand when you see the movie) and drives off for another wave and you feel the pain that Spilner must feel as his driving mentor speeds away, possibly to his doom.  Although Spilner is not as disenchanted with Law enforcement as he was in the genre spawning Point Break I, you get the feeling that he may still cash in his badge and join the NASCAR circuit.  Overall, a fun summer movie full of mindless entertainment.  Heh, there are worse ways to kill 2 hours.",The Fast and the Furious

I went on the opening day the first showtime on the island and I came in it expecting only 2 great racing scenes, I was wrong.  This movie is filled with very spectacular stunts and it had a storyline that I could follow.

677,fox_jedi,"Before this film i didn't give and care about cars, Now i am a car guy",8,15 April 2002,"This film (That i was DRAGGED to by my friends) was an entire 180 from what i thought it was going to be. I figured, ""Fast cars and the losers who race them"" I got a semi-intelligent film with perfect casting and a well thought out story line. the film dipped into some overdone effects in the first race but afterwards it was great.The film really hits home with the casting and dialogue, the whole film has a feel like they just set the camera down in the middle of the street racing scene and every line feels improvised. (Which i found out on the DVD that many of the lines were). it raises itself just above the typical ""Teen"" movie but still keeps true to that youthful genre. I hated cars before i saw this film, I never thought anything about racing or about cars in general and i thought only idiot greese monkeys touched them for fun, now i've souped up my cutlass supreme and race almost every week.",The Fast and the Furious
678,ttjam,Worth The Ticket Price,10,22 June 2001,"The Fast And The Furious is a thrill ride from beginning to end.  The heart pounding action made me squirm in my chair.  The cleverly filmed racing sequence was amazing and from that point on my eyes were glued to the screen.  Although the plotline isn't very original they carried it well. Vin Diesel, who played the roll of the street racing leader, gave a strong performance and you could really feel for each character.  I even started feeling sorry for the evil Japanese gang leader.The semi-jacking scenes were awesome.  They totally freaked me out... in a cool way though.  I didn't know what to expect.  Paul Walker's acting was pretty Keanu-ish.  He was a total surfer boy throughout the whole movie. The make-up people were trying way too hard to make him look rugged and normal.  It was pretty hard for me to believe HE was a cop. He's way too boyish and cute for the part.  But, I have to admit, those looks of his were one of the reasons I wanted to see the movie. In the end it came together really well. I suggest that you don't wait for this one to come out on video because you will be missing so much.  With the surround sound of the theater, the engines mixed with the soundtrack and the plot work great together.  I went in expecting a B+ and i got blown away by an A+++++++ movie.",The Fast and the Furious
679,ironmacd,"The Fast and the Furious was so good, I felt the need to register and share my views of the movie, thats how good it is",8,23 June 2001,"Don't let anyone fool you, the Fast and the Furious is a wonderfully entertaining movie. If you saw the trailer and though that it looked like a fun roller coaster ride styled action movie then you are absolutely correct. The best summation you could give of the film is that its like two hours of what you see in the trailer. It's seriously one of the most accurately advertised and needless to say one of the most fun and entertaining movies of the year.The racing scenes have been cleverly filmed and edited together in a way that gives you a false sense of motion with lots of first person views as cars race down the street. In addition, just about every scene in the movie looks really sharp thanks to nice lighting, some visual effects, and just plain good camera work. The direction of camera work for the most part is very traditional in the sense that each major scene is proceeded by a few seconds of a `set up' shot that gives you a feeling for the size and surroundings of a scene locale. The majority of the dialogue shots and racing shots are of course third person, however, many of these shots are extremely tight giving you a very strong sense of being there.
Vin Diesel's performance is convincing and very entertaining. He's extremely enigmatic and seems to have that quality that some actors like Bruce Willis have. That quality of coming off as being an extremely cool person who you just know you'd be best friends with. Paul Walker's performance while somewhat wooden, really isn't bad at all. In fact if you really stopped and thought about his character's motivation Paul's on screen apprehension and uncertainty early in the film actually fits his character. Stack that up against his wide eyed and completely commanding on screen presence toward the end of the film and you've got the complete emotional stages of his character that realistically depicts a man in his situation. The rest of the main cast really deserves a lot of credit too. Sure they might not be a lot well known actors, but I'd have to imagine that a few of them will be after a few casting agents see this movie since there really isn't a bad performance in the movie.The writing and dialogue is fairly decent. Sure it isn't the most original story ever, but it does a great job of delivering a plot through the use of a lot of action. The dialogue while a bit awkward a couple of times is for the most part well done.In the end, you won't be disappointed in The Fast and the Furious if you like action movies, cars, or Vin Diesel. The story is decent, the sound and visuals are fantastic, and you'll walk out of the theater with a big smile and the undying urge to drive really reckless while listening to loud music. The PG-13 rating is a very liberal one by the way, people shoot and are shot by guns on screen, some language, some slight skin, but since the movie moves so fast and is so loud, you really think you hear and see more than you actually do. Great movie!",The Fast and the Furious

When I first saw it advertised I knew that I was going to spend my $5.  The attention-grabbing, high-speed racing and chases were put together perfectly.  The soundtrack will be a must have as well.  I am not sure why the critics dogged it so much.  It appeals to the age group that spends the most money on movies.  It was loud, fast, adrenaline-pumping action that kept everyone's eyes glued to the screen.  I am a female who LOVES cars and this movie just made me want to be a race car driver.  So don't let Rolling Stone magazine and other newspapers determine whether you see this movie or not.  This movie fits our generation and you can't help but leave the theater with a smile on your face and feel the urge to shout, ""Yeah!!""Oh, and people did drive out of the parking lot with screeching tires after the movie.

Definitely.,10,24 June 2001,"Some people might not enjoy this film, yet I feel that it overall reflects what's going on out there on the streets both today as well as several years back when I used to race the streets of Tacoma, WA. The cars may have changed, but not much else. Street racing has always been and will be, a part of our culture (if not a somewhat darker part) as long as there are automobiles on roads. The acting is ""average"", although Vin Diesel is beginning to make it very plain that he is coming into his own as he gets more work. -Very cool in Pitch Black by the way. I give the action scenes a high score as they do give the viewer an excellent impression of the speed experienced behind the wheel of these cars. Special effects and stunts are ""well toned"" and placed where they need to be. By now you might guess that I really enjoyed this flick. I just hope the DVD is a collector's edition with lots of extras, especially with more racing footage!

The plot with so many turn that is feels like your driving the car instead of watching them. I'm sorry but when the writer of this film wrote the script he had to have been half a sleep or thrown it together in two minutes because I could have wrote some thing better in my sleep. All this film is, is a plot that that gets dumber as it tries to play out, several good actors with very bad lines, nice looking cars and little boring love story that has no end.

Even if this movie is more concerned with the milieu of this racing society and the relationships among the characters, it needs logical plot development.  The fact that it doesn't have it aside, perhaps, from the ""revelation"" that the ""team"" must be getting all that money SOMEWHERE (something that could be said about just about every ""team"" out there), is the major weakness of the film.  In fact, one senses the only reason the guilty party IS the guilty party is because the writers sat around drinking a little too much Corona and decided, in their drunken state, that it would be cool to have those people be guilty...of course because it would maximally affect one particular relationship...which, of course, leads to the huge cop-out of an ending.

No other movie has ever given me such an urge to jump into my car and put the pedal to the medal...unfortunately, I drive nothing like the cars in the movie, so I don't go anywhere when I floor it.

Lots of Laughing gas and tricked out cars going 140+ mph. Although I am not a big fan of imports, I liked to see they did things the right way. Most cars I see like that are all show and no go. These really moved! Granted they had to drop like $80k to get them into the 10's...

No matter your gender, race, or ethnic background, when you leave the movie theatre I promise you will want to burn your tires.  I suggest this movie for a first date, last date or a guys/girls night out!!!",The Fast and the Furious
701,eag_414,I absolutely loved the movie. Vin Diesel rocks!! And Michelle Rodriguez is HOT!!,10,3 July 2001,"I absolutely love this movie. The stunts and cars are phenominal. The 1969 Dodger that Vin Diesel's character drives is my favorite. It stars Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, Michelle Rodriguez, Jordana Brewster, Rick Yune, and a small role that Ja Rule perfects. Vin Diesel plays Dominic Toretto, the leader of a group of street racers who also hi-jack 18 wheelers and steal their goods. Paul Walker plays Brian O. Spilner, a undercover cop who must bust Toretto and his team to get a cop badge. He ends up falling for Jordana Brewster's character Mia Toretto who's the sister of Dominic. Michelle Rodriguez plays Letty, a tom boy type street racer, and also Dominic's lover(real life girlfriend). Rick Yune plays Jonny Tran, a street racer and Dominic Toretto's rival. Spilner(Walker) ends up getting too deep with Dominic(Diesel) and becomes his buddy. He and Mia(Brewster) begin a short lived relationship. He reveals himself to her as a cop and convinces her to help him stop Dominic before he gets himself killed trying to make his big bust. Dominic(Diesel) ends up losing one of his friends, nearly losing another one, and nearly losing his. In the end Spilner(Walker) lets Dominic(Diesel) off the hook by giving him a 10 second car he owed him by losing too him in a race. The Fast and The Furious is the best movie I've seen in a long time!!",The Fast and the Furious
702,abney27,Point Break 2,6,6 July 2001,"This movie, while fast and furious, was a complete ripoff of Point Break. There were no surfboards, but the plot was the same and Paul Walker does one heck of a Keanu Reeves impression. I liked it for what it was. It was just incredibly difficult not to see the parallels and not imagine Paul Walker saying ""Woah."" All in all, not a bad summer film.",The Fast and the Furious
703,erikdlee,imports and fast driving...,10,6 July 2001,"If you like import cars and fast driving.. u will love this movie.. i've seen it more then 3 times! Can't wait for the DVD!

People say the story line is not good.. but you don't go for the story line! SO stop your complaining!",The Fast and the Furious
704,BriNi145,What I thought,10,7 July 2001,"Here is what I thought of the fast and the furious. The reason why I was interested in this movie is first Vin Diesel, he is a very talented young man and I enjoy his work. Second, Michelle Rodriguez, she is also very talented and I loved Girl Fight. Also the preview just ""wow."" The previews are the one thing that motivate me. Fast and the Furious has kick a$$ cars and a great cast. The movie is excellent. I gave it a ten, cuz that's what it deserves.",The Fast and the Furious
705,remergence98,Brilliant,10,14 February 2002,"All I can say about this film is that's one of the best racing films I've seen in years, the use of sound is amazing the engines roar from here there and everywhere, yeah so the story maybe a bit thin and it may seem that you are watching the film version of the game Driver.  But all in all it's a none stop thrill of fast cars and brilliant action sequences from the great Rob Cohen (Dragon: The Bruce Lee Story), My recommendation is that if you haven't seen it then WHY NOT.",The Fast and the Furious
706,bizkutbabe143,The Film Is The Best,10,8 July 2001,"This movie is the best movie i have ever seen.

707,Uleepera,Fast paced... adrenaline rush.,10,9 July 2001,"In as short as possible, I think this has been one of the best action movies to grace the screens in a few years. Vin Diesel does a superb job as does the rest of the cast. Also to their credit they tried to stick as realistic as possible with the stunts and equipment used. 2 thumbs up.",The Fast and the Furious
708,SpecialKinFla,Cinematography was great despite bad plot and acting,6,13 July 2001,"This movie was all in all o.k., but the only reason I stayed through the whole thing was the spectacular camera angles and directing. Everything else in this film was bad :the acting, writing and plot. The whole scene where Vin Diesel, ""Dominic"",  was talking about how his father died was such forced sentiment I almost laughed. A movie like this should never try to pull at heart strings because it isn't working.",The Fast and the Furious
709,mcbengs,Just a quick good game!,10,14 July 2001,"Outstanding movie, makes me want to go out and sup up my car and race somebody.  A definate see.  I loved the fast cars, the high speed adrenalin, and some good lookin women. One of the best ""car"" movies i've seen yet.",The Fast and the Furious
710,tigergirl_2001,It's all about the men and their toys!!! Woo Hoo,10,19 July 2001,The movie the fast and the furious was by far the best movie I have seen this year.  I have seen it twice already and I will continue to see it again while it is in the box office.  Vin Diesel and Paul Walker and Ja Rule (as short as his skit was) played a excellent role in the movie.  This movie gave me and my co-watchers a instant adrenaline rush and after the movie we were all able to spot who had seen the movie just by their driving.  I know that the movie kicked butt but people need to be careful after seeing it because they don't drive safely.  If everyone would just go to see the movie and not try to participate in what it's actions were it would be one of the best movies of all time.  Thanks to Vin Diesel and Paul Walker and Ja Rule!! You men are the bomb babies..! Thanks for listening to us. - Sherri and Sarah,The Fast and the Furious

If you like fast cars with high risk scenes, this movie is for you , If you like import cars this movie is definitely for you and if you are looking for a fast-paced movie with good racing sequences this is also one for you. The acting is good , with a plot that comes with nice follow up sequences.This movie has girls , cars , action , racing and all the stuff import showdown events bring you. This movie will amaze and dazzle all that want to enjoy their hour and a half with nice treats and occasional girlie eye-candy. If you are one of those people that are looking for a thick plot w/ exceptional acting this may not be for you , mainly because the Cars take up most of the spotlight.Get ready to be dazzled , this movie is for all to enjoy and its not only about the looks of cars !BTW --The orange car - (Paul walker - brian spillner's car) The Supra is a monster and the real owner has upto 650 - 700 HP in actual gains.My favorites are the 3 neon green lit black civics.

Now that i have watched the movie, i love cars. I thought this movie deserved 2 thumbs up because it was interesting and theres lots of action pack in it. I liked this movie alot because it gives you a look and feeling how it is like to race and to have people race against you. I especially liked how they made a movie only about street racing. I would rate it 10 out of 10 because it has alot of action pack and it doesnt take awhile before the movie gets into the action, in this movie it starts right away. I think whoever loves old or fancy and fast cars will love this movie and i loved all the cars in this movie especially the black car in the end.(the one vin disel was driving)",The Fast and the Furious

717,rodmunch1988,Where's the American Hotrod v-8?,7,19 September 2001,"Ok i have to give this movie some credit, the story was (i thought) interesting. However I found it odd that near the end they tried to create pity for the characters who were breaking the law, and the antagonist to the main character. But what fantasy city is this where there are a bunch of 4 cylinders that gather and no 8cyl car for miles??? The main character drove a Supercharged lightning and races in a crappy 4 cyl. I think that the creators of this movie forgot that the the world record for acceleration is held by a v-8. Of course there was 1 mean car in the movie, but... the first time you see it run, well you'll just have to see just what happens for your self. Anyway if you want to see better than decent film with an interesting story, then see this movie. If you like ""FAST"" cars then go to a local race track.",The Fast and the Furious

722,Rextacy,Great film for what it was,10,24 September 2001,"Sometimes I'm constantly amazed to read reviews by people who have so obviously gone to a movie they either didn't want to watch or knew wouldn't really interest them. To these people, I say give your money to charity or something, I've never understood those people who have so little to do in their life that they go and see every movie ever made then complain about 90% of them. Life is like that, I happen to think Star Wars sucks, so when a new Star Wars movie comes out, you know what?! I DON'T go and see it! TF&TF is like this. For those who enjoy cars...no let me rephrase that, for those who love cars, this is a great film. It really makes ""Gone in 60 seconds"" look like an excuse of a car film - they raid a Ferrari garage and we see about 5 seconds of actual DRIVING? WHAT WERE THEY THINKING! Not so in The Fast and The Furious, thankfully. The riced out cars may not be to everyone's tastes, but owning a powerful turbo vehicle myself, they actually captured my imagination with the audio - the vehicles sounded immaculate with audible induction noise, blow off valves and sweet exhaust notes throughout the movie. The black muscle-car near the end of the movie absolutely thundered in Dolby delight in my cinema, and was awe inspiring. With a decent home theatre setup at home, not much impresses me these days but I was blown away by the audio at most times in this film. It reminded me why I still bother going to the cinema. Visually the movie was fine, the stunts were well executed and the camera angles engaging. You don't go to an action movie to see involving dialog, you go to remove yourself from reality and have a damn good time doing it, and I felt TF&TF did this well. The fact it was about a subject close to my heart (cars) just added to my personal like for the film. My wife, who dislikes a lot of films I enjoy, also loved the film - which surprised me seeing it was so obviously a male oriented film. Yes the plot was a bit weak, the dialog a bit shabby at times, and the acting a bit forced. The corny ""I live my life a quarter mile at a time"" was almost laughable, but taken in context was bearable. But at the end of the day, this was a fantastic movie for car freaks - the same crowd who will spend $50 on specialised videos JUST about cars, with no plot, no Dolby surround, no multi-million dollar budget. If you take this movie for what it is, a fast action romp around the car racing scene, then it does its job admirably IMHO. I think those thoughts are backed up by the huge haul it has done at the box office, and I'm even thinking of seeing it again, something I've not done since I was a stupid teenager :) Go see it, and grab it on DVD - I know I will.",The Fast and the Furious

The plot of the film gives street racers somewhat of a bad name, but most people don't hold them in high reguards anyway. I was also happy to see the love story part of the movie take backseat to the cars and the street racers lifestyle. I gave this movie a 10, however, I believe you'll only fully appreciate this film if you are a true car enthusiast.",The Fast and the Furious

This is not a movie to watch if you know anything about cars and engines and racing.  It's a movie to waste two hours of your life to.  It is full of errors, boring predictable plot, and some of the worst acting witnessed.

727,tomchiz318,Fast and furious all the way,10,4 January 2002,"PLEASE DO NOT READ IF YOU HAVE YET TO SEE THE FILM, THE ENDING IS REVEALED IN THIS COMMENT...The Fast and the Furious, the underground sleeper hit of 2001. Not everybody saw it, but most of those who did see it loved it. Starring Vin Diesel as Dominic Toretto, Paul Walker as Brian O'Connor, and the sexy Jordana Brewster as Dominic's sister Mia, it centres around the escapades of Dominic and his ""team"" of car enthusiasts, who fix up cars when not racing them at breakneck speeds down a ¼ mile stretch of road. Gone are the American muscle cars such as the Viper and the Corvette, replaced by the computer chipped, NOS screaming Japanese super cars, like the Toyota Supra, Honda Civic, and Nissan Skyline. Such beautiful cars blend well with the great cast, as they are as much part of the film as the actors are. The amount of camera time they are given is just enough to show you how powerful and brilliant the cars are, but not too much to suggest they're only there for advertising sakes (like the ridiculous amount of screen time given to the Fed-Ex label in Castaway (2000), which spoils the film). Vin Diesel lives the part of Dominic, a brilliant driver who ""lives his life a quarter of a mile at a time"". His performance is as beefy as you'd expect from the actor who played killer Richard B Riddick in the 2000 hit Pitch Black. He delivers his lines with a style that suggests his character; a nice person when not racing, but deadly serious and all for himself when strapped into his vehicle. Paul Walker is just as good as the undercover cop Brian, hoping to pin a serious of jaw dropping robberies to Dominic. As he learns more about Dom and his team, he falls for Mia, also a great driver, and the lifestyle of fast cars, guns and women. As the film gets near it's amazing climax he struggles to keep his mind on why he's here; to catch Dominic Toretto and put him behind bars. But as they grow closer to each other it gets harder for Brian to do so. Anyone who loved the high speed chases in Ronin, The French Connection, or Bullit, will love the stunts in The Fast and the Furious. From the opening attack on the lorry, with the three sexy Civic's floating on their green neon light as they swerve and cruise around the truck, to the first race and the last race, the action is filmed so cleverly it seems impossible that cars could do what they did. The Civic that slides under the lorry as they speed down the motorway in the pre-credit sequence is simply amazing, and the adrenaline buzz from the first time Dominic and Brian race is great. It all flows so seamlessly between the racing, the stealing, and the normal life of the characters that you don't know what to expect right up until the end. The final scene, however, is outstanding. When Dominic tells Brian midway through the movie about the car he and his father built, a 1969 Dodge Charger with ""900 horses of power"", it's presence is overwhelming, and when he says he's never driven it because ""it scares the shit outta me"", your spine tingles. Dom then pulls it up to the start line he used to race on. He and Brian (driving a Supra) both await the green light, and when it arrives, and Dominic floors the throttle, the car pulls up violently and makes more noise than the cinema could handle, as it screamed off down the road at a shattering speed. But as they get toward the end, the movie stopped for a split second. If Dominic hit the train, and died, then it would become a bad ending to a good film. Neither hit the train, but then Dominic smashes into a truck and flies into the air. Again, if he had died it would be a bad ending, but he did not. The final choice, which fell to Brian as the police sirens got louder, was whether to let Dom go. He does, telling him ""I owe you a 10 second car"", and signifies a great ending to a brilliant film. From start to finish The Fast and the Furious is a NOS powered adrenaline rush, with beautiful actors, scenery, and even more beautiful cars. The start of the final race will live in my memory for a long time still.",The Fast and the Furious

They dont have a clue what a good movie is, or what good acting is.  This movie is action packed and has a great plot.  This is a movie with a topic that is not talked about a lot,and definitly doesn't have a lot of movies talking about it, and it's a very interesting subject.  The actors played their parts very well and where great co-stars for the awesome cars in this movie.  I'll say if you dont like cars,racing,and action then this probably isn't the movie for you.

I rushed out to rent it based on the four star review given by my nephew (who's only seventeen). That should have been a clue right there. This movie is for kids!!!  It seriously lacks realism, intelligent dialogue and has no plot that is worth following.  It seems that this movie was made simply to show off a few fancy cars, which may be the only thing worth looking at in this movie.  Don't look for any award winning acting or a story here.  The only beneficial outcome to this movie experience for me is that I didn't shell out twenty dollars to buy this movie.",The Fast and the Furious

I was expecting crap and that's what I got, so I'm going to give this one a 10.' (You don't rate a movie on how it met your expectations, you rate them compared to OTHER MOVIES. Don't read reviews with the title ""What did you expect?"") If those are not what you want to hear, read on.SPOILERS. This movie is about a hip-hop cop who infiltrates a street racing gang that hijacks trucks for fun. You've got to see the hijacking to believe it; those idiots tear up stuff worth much more than whatever is in the truck. From the very beginning it's hard to believe that this Walker dude is a police officer. He acts like a teenager; the only thing missing is those baggy pants that you can get lost in; he's got the accent and everything right. This gang leader guy, Diesel Tornado, is also a tough hip-hop punk, so they get along quite well. And the way Tornado's girlfriend acts makes me wonder is she's really a girl, or an undercover guy. She doesn't act girly and she's got a scorn on her face 24/7 - not pretty. Somebody tell me why a 1/4 mile race lasts a few minutes with 10 second cars. Oh, and the last guy to hit the tiny red button on the steering wheel wins. If you read some of the other reviews, you'll probably notice that every second one says it's a clone of 'Point Break'.Here's how you make a really cool movie: 1. Get pretty actors, and... that's it. It doesn't need to be original. As long as all the viewers fall in love with the actors, they're going to love everything about the movie. So what if a floodboard magically comes back into the car? So what if the cop doesn't do his job, just to get the respect of his fellow hip-hop buddy? Who cares?The music was okay. (I had to say something good.)Now here's how you know if you'll like the movie or not. You'll like it if any of the following is true:You find anyone in the cast you're in love with. - You call your friends 'brothers' and 'sisters' (and not because you're a priest). - You only pull your pants halfway up and you cover the rest with 5 layers of shirts (longer one at the bottom). - You're a car enthusiast. - You're pretty stupid and you like your movies the same way.If you're into hip-hop, this movie will make you feel good. Be proud of the time you spent in jail, support your friends who break the law and go practise your special handshake with your buddies.Look for an increase of street racing in your area and thank the people who made this garbage.1/10",The Fast and the Furious

If you are after a film that will make you think while providing you with a new and interesting look at the world, then this is not the film for you. If you want a film that you can just sit down a watch for alittle bit of fun then I say this is it. Because lets face we've seen the plot a thousand times before and it's still as predictable as ever, but the film doesn't pretend to have a twister of a plot it's very clear that cars are it's focal point. It's like every other film, if you walk in with certain expectations that aren't met then you'll be let down.

The acadmey should nominate this for cinematography and its' outstanding special effects. If u want an adrenaline rush: The Fast and the Furious has got it.,The Fast and the Furious
744,kurkosdr,Awful movie...,1,22 January 2009,"Awful movie made in order to help makers of ugly body kits and rims sell their garbage to teens desperately wanting to make their economy cars go faster (see: ricers).Mind you, the fast and the furious movie IS NOT a movie for car enthusiasts. This movie is trying to PASS ITSELF as a movie for car enthusiasts, in order to extract money from teens on needless ""upgrades"" by making them believe they can become real racers (and car enthusiasts) too.---This movie has either been made: 1) By a bunch of people having no clue how cars work whatsoever (as I 've seen the inside of a Mazda shown as having pistons and not rotary engine) 2) Or by a bunch of marketing guys trying to make people throw their cash away hoping to make their rusty urban car into a super car (as I 've seen blatant advertising of several part makers, and trying to make the audience believe that skylines, supra s and civics with silly modifications like ugly body kits and rims are the best cars to drive around in a city*) ---Need more convincing? Here are the Lessons I learned From The fast and The furious:There is absolutely nothing wrong with installing a nitrous oxide system in a stock engine. Why someone shouldn't? The only thing you have to worry about is not to burn your piston rings. Yes, these damn piston rings. You don't have to worry about losing a valve, destroying the piston itself, or blowing up the engine block. Flames coming out of the exhaust all the time is good, cos, you know, it looks cool and doesn't mean that the air-fuel mixture is improperly balanced and the catalytic converter will melt the next second. -When attempting to go around a corner, make sure your car slides (aka ""drifts"") to the side as much possible, 30 degrees or more, as this is the right way of driving fast.All these -so called- professional racers at WTCC, trying to keep clean lines and never slide more than 30 degrees, are pathetic losers forced to drive politically correct by their bosses. Only Vin Diesel knows how to drive really fast and like a real man. Mazda's do not have rotary engines---Final Verdict: 1.3 That's 1 point for the Challenger I saw in the end(it would have been a 2.4 if they hadn't removed the 'hemi' engine during the drag scene and put a fake air scoop), plus 0.3 for effects. This would have been a nice and fun movie, IF the makers DIDN'T PRETEND to be knowing about the subject it was dealing with and MADE IT AS FUNNY AS POSSIBLE. Period.Also see: Need For Speed Underground (a formerly good racing video game that replaced super cars with bummers, exotics roads with boring urban landscape, and the concept of just racing for fun with the concept of fitting loads of plastic junk to a economy car to earn ""rep"", races, magazine covers and chicks -in that order-)*I am not saying the Skyline, Supra and Civic aren't good cars. They are very reliable and well made machines, that can do wonders in the hands of someone that is a real car enthusiast.",The Fast and the Furious
745,rwmccauley,There's 90 minutes I won't get back...,1,8 March 2003,"Point Break, with cars instead of surf boards. And really stupid drivers. Only not as good. And totally lacking in moral compass.",The Fast and the Furious
746,Landryan,A sexist racist pile of poop,1,5 March 2002,"Oh dear.Where do we start?Let's ignore the fact that this film was poorly plotted, poorly scripted, badly conceived and reminiscent of the tackiest MTV video you can think of. Let's remain blissfully unaware of the production values that would make yesterdays breakfast look like a five course dinner. Let's also overlook the poorest acting I've seen from young Hollywood ""talent"" since Sunset Beach.Yes, lets.Okay, onto the REALLY objectionable stuff...Firstly, the only oriental characters involved are not only street punk goons but also the primary bad guys. Okay, so the main goon's dad is in it too for about five seconds and isn't very happy at his sons conduct, but this is hardly an excuse to have such a racially imbalanced plotline. This is the 21st century and this cowboys and indians style concept is worthy of a prison sentence, particulary as it comes from a country where racial equality is considered to be a key issue.Secondly, we see lots and lots of cars and... guess what? Oh yes, women wearing next to nothing running around allowing their drivers to fondle their ""assets"", then offering threesomes. Despite the fact that the realisim factor is minute - surely most women would despair of a guy who's life revolved around his car - it also portrays an image of women as mere sex objects to pleasure guys in fast cars. Again, we have one token female who is a racer, but this hardly makes this kind of imagery morally sound, and the camera still takes time to wander over her person with an almost feral attention to detail.By portraying these women as trophies, it suggests that irresponsible behaviour such as street racing can earn you sexual favours. This is of course complete rubbish in the case of nearly every single woman with an IQ above 0.2.Finally, I would just like to point out that the entire plot and premise of the film displays a complete lack of belief in safe, responsible driving. Not a single seatbelt is seen throughout the entire film, people have horrific accidents in their cars then stroll out completely unscathed, and not once did I see a crash helmet or protective clothing except on the ""oriental bad guy goons"". What sort of message is that sending out to our 13 and 15 year olds as they begin to reach the age where they can legally drive?To sum it up, this is a meathead movie, made for meatheads by meatheads. Avoid at all costs and burn copies wherever possible!!!",The Fast and the Furious

This movie has everything that every pre-teen and hell even young adult could want, cars (bad ass cars by the way), adrenaline, and the experience it takes to be a street racer. I myself have seen street races go on, even before the movie and when I saw the movie I just kept wanting to see them more and more... Well to sum up this boring summary I would have to say this truly is in my ALL-TIME TOP 5 movies, and I recommend all you haven't seen it, because others told them it had a ""bad dialogue"". But forget them and see this flick.",The Fast and the Furious

The characters are so real and easy to see their point of view.I love the camera work it gives you a feel of the movie. Chills run down your spine as the character presses on the gas and slams on the brakes and when they change gears. This movie is WONDERFUL!",The Fast and the Furious
751,chaos-addicts,"Enjoyable, Fast, Exciting, Horse-power.",9,17 March 2002,"Contrary to the other post I have seen on this movie, I enjoyed it. I have to admit that it was definitely predictable at some points but other parts did keep you guessing, especially if you didn't read movie inlay/plot sumary. I'm sure many will agree though, anything it lost in predictability it made up with sheer horse-power and speed. The cinematography techniques used in this movie to enhance the viewers experience with the speed were excellently designed and implemented. I was especially glad to see a movie about fast cars and racing that didn't break down into some romance or deep-felt-drama. It kept its side topics light and its main plot prominant.I recommend viewing this movie, it was worth the £3.75 rental charge.",The Fast and the Furious
752,abernfich,Great Movie,10,10 May 2002,This movie was a great car racing movie. If you dont like cars or dont like to see races then dont bother seeing this movie. Everyone expects this movie to be superb and its not but its a great movie.  I suggest seeing this. I've watched this movie like 10 times and it gets better and better!,The Fast and the Furious
753,ILuVPaULWaLkEr,Sweet Movie-You must see it!!,10,22 March 2002,"I thought that The Fast and the Furious was a great movie. Although I did enjoy the cars in the movie, I also enjoyed Paul Walker, who played Officer Brian O'Connor/Brian Spillner. This movie really got me hooked on him. I have also seen Joy Ride with him and liked that too, not just because Paul Walker is in it! I have always been into cars, so when this came out, I was psyched. I love how they drive the Celica in it, cuz that is my ultimate car right there and hope to buy one some day. The Fast and the Furious is jam packed with hot cars and action as the audience is thrown into the world of street racing. I hope that they do a sequel, although I do not think it would be as good.",The Fast and the Furious
754,Lisa-Michelle,Best film ever. Some comment are SO WRONG!,10,30 March 2002,"I loved the film I have only watched it 3 times but the first time I saw it was yesterday so I suppose it is quite a lot. All of you people who say that you didn't like it because it had no plot obviously don't know what you are talking about. And people who say that it wasn't supposed to be an interesting movie and that the best line was ""I'll have the tuna"" also don't have a clue.Of course this film had good cars pretty girl and gorgeous men but then what film doesn't! Saying that it hadn't been thought out. Have you even listened to the film. One line which I love and has obviously been thought out is said by Domonic(Vin Diesel)who is a brilliant actor for any1 who says hes not ,and that was :""I live my life a quarter mile at a time ,nothing else matters.....for those 10 seconds or less I'm free"" That is actually how some people feel about racing and whatever they do.This film is NOT about fast girls and fast cars it is about what life is like for people who do this in real life. It is about how people feel about their team and about friendship because come on the cop gives up on his job for his friends and his love. If you go in expecting it to be fast girls and fast cars then you will see it as that but if you go in with an open mind you will see that it is the best movie ever made. The cars girl and men are all just bonuses to the brilliant storyline! GO SEE IT AND YOU WILL LOVE IT LIKE I DO!",The Fast and the Furious
755,Mikaeljensen,A great movie,10,21 June 2002,"This is the BEST movie ever made ( if you are in to cars and racing ). The cars are awesome and the girl are nice too.

756,braveheart_alloa,Pretty damn good!!!!!,8,6 June 2002,"I wasn't too sure about seeing this film when I first heard about it but I thought I would give it a chance anyway. Michelle Rodriguez and Jordana Brewster are worth the admission fee alone,Rodriguez looks extremely hot and will keep you looking for more.  If thats not enough there is action as well. Not to mention the amazing cars.The music only adds to the greatness of it.  Especially Ja Rule his sound track captures the mood of the film perfectly. I would give this film an 8 or 9 out of Ten and would recommend it to any film fan.Vin Diesel and Paul Walker seem to work well together and if you are taking a girl to see it it might just keep them interested in the film as well.",The Fast and the Furious

Which failed as a film because of bad acting with the exception of Vin Diesel who is excellent in this film and a very thin story line.A six out of ten, because of Vin Diesel's acting at the up and coming talents of Paul Walker who is already a fine actor.Watch this film if you love fast cars!!",The Fast and the Furious

The plot is a little too weak for my liking but once you have figured it out it won't distract you from the film.  Once you start watching the film raises your enjoyment level to over 200mph with a big grin on your face.  Definitely recommended for car fans!",The Fast and the Furious

While it's not Oscar material, it's a fun, fast ride with simple, likable characters easy to root for and exciting to watch.  Vin Diesel's performance is one of the film's highlights along with the heart-pounding effects and action sequences.  While the plot is a bit thin, the film delivers what it promises and doesn't profess to be something it's not.

But when I saw it, I was very disappointed.  The whole movie did not really have to much of a plot, which already ruined it, and the the movie just revolved around cars,cars,cars. And I guess that's ok if your into that sort of thing. Id just assume to watch nascar, which I hate. I remember commenting to one of my friends who also so it that it would have been so cool if at the end Vin Diesel would have gotten nailed by the train, and he said, ""No it wouldn't!

The acting was impeccable! Vin Diesel and Paul Walker are two actors, not soon to be forgotten, and with the sequel coming out in 2003, who COULD forget them?! They are obviously the hottest onscreen duo that I have seen in a long time! Many memorable lines will forever be etched into he minds of viewers such as: ""You break her heart, I'll break your neck"" (Vin Diesel); ""...it doesn't matter if you win by an inch or a mile- winning is winning."" (also Vin Diesel). This movie is by far a definite winner and everyone that I have talked to that doesn't like it... haven't even seen i. They say the commercials for it don't look good!

It entertained me throughout the whole thing, and I'd have to say the acting is a lot better than said by others to be..  The only one lacking to me, was Paul Walker, and, well, we've always known he wasn't much of an actor.. just a pretty face. However, the rest of the cast did an awesome job.

I had spotted this film on a supermarket shelf when it entered the DVD charts (early 2002) and I was tempted to buy. Yup I was nearly suckered by the hype about car stunts and babes. Fortunately I spent my money on routine groceries and as it turns out it was about the same quantity of cash spent on writing the plot.Well fair do's in the end you do get some fast shiny car stunts and cliched Hollywood babes but nothing more noteworthy than the cheap US TV-movie standard car stunts and Hollywood babes you can stumble on channel-hopping Sky. You will not witness anything new or groundbreaking here. It does not get that fast and not particularly furious. At least to my eyes. On the other hand maybe this is the benchmark movie to test if you are an old fogey. Clearly from other reviews this must all look so different to the target early teen market. The only thing missing from this movie is ""The Logical Song"" by Scooter booming out of glossy hot-hatches as they pelt down the road.Now there is a thought. Someone should make a Brit-movie remake with the aforementioned Supertramp track, visits to Halfords for the custom go-faster stripes, gold plated multi-coloured speaker cable and clip-on girth-boosting chrome tail pipes. Fat slags in Novas munching chips instead of Californian babes and Steve Coogan as the lead role. Call it ""The Fat and the Spurious: Grim up North"".The Fast and The Furious.

Then he joins a cool L.A. suberb group that is the middle of the racing world.

Not too good actors, but what the heck, you don´t look at XXX-movies because of the ""good"" storyline? One of the worst things about this movie is that they included Vin Diesel (Dominick Toretto) as a co-star. I don´t like that at all because he´s probably the worst actor since... Well i can´t even recall an even worse actor. Probably Vanilla Ice in that high school movie. I can´t even recall the title of it. Paul Walker isn´t that good either. But then again. It´s the cars that plays the leading roles of this movie. Just a little too much Honda Civics",The Fast and the Furious

789,Gberry-6,"nice cars, bad acting",1,24 January 2005,"If you like hot import cars and hardcore street racing, then watch videos of real life on the internet, instead of seeing this movie. This is a fine example of how predictable movies have become and how they are just used to make already famous sellouts like Ja Rule look better, when it just waters down their originality and makes them become mainstream chumps. Well i have too short of an entry so i guess i will talk about how cheesy Vin Diesel is as an actor and this is why we only see him in these over budgeted-for having such a lame plot type of movies, just like Ja Rule. i think this movie was just a waste of money and should not of got so much credit for being a good MOVIE, while in reality it was just a bunch of really nice imports racing about. i like those cars just as much as the next guy, but as a movie its just garbage.",The Fast and the Furious

In a story that makes paint on a wall seem interesting.A film made for teenage boys and twenty year olds or fathers who like younger women.The characters yet again in films like this, lack any kind of reality.Boring and over the top. Watch Ronin for fabulous car chases and real characters.Absolutely awful! Vile! Destroy the DVD... Now!",The Fast and the Furious
791,Jonathan-K_97,Great movie.,8,19 March 2015,"I've been watching the first five movies in the series recently. Must say, all of them are great movies if you're into cars and action. Really not that much to say, lots of action, lots of cars and really entertaining to watch. Actors are/were great, according to me Vin Diesel and Paul Walker are/were great actors. Too bad that Paul Walker is gone now, he was one of the best if not the best actor in the series according to me. Although all the actors were great but Paul was probably my absolute favorite. Very short review, I know, I can't find many bad things to criticize about this movie. Great actors, full of action and lots of awesome cars but not the greatest movie according to me, just a great movie that is entertaining to watch is all I can say really.",The Fast and the Furious
792,seldaibrahim,Awesome Movie..One of my Favourites from collection :),9,18 April 2015,"Awesome Movie.The best of the Fast and furious collection in my opinion.The best thing is watching the whole collection and then returning back to the first one , that is when you really truly appreciate it for what it is..Seeing Paul walker,Vin diesel and all the other actors together really puts a smile on your face. The only thing i honestly didn't like was, there just wasn't enough action, but then again there isn't too much action like the new ones which just drain your life tbh. Such a great movie which focuses on the main idea of bringing family together.If you haven't watched it your missing out and i suggest that you get onto it straightaway.. Hope you enjoy it as much as i have .. :)",The Fast and the Furious
793,imahack,"""I need NOS, lots of NOS cuz my car has no engine""",1,19 July 2005,"What can I say? Slow cars, bad acting, terrible music, and cheezy looking action scenes. First off, there is nothing ""fast"" or ""furious"" about a Honda or any of these tacky looking cars. The only decent cars in the movie are the Ferrari, F150 Lightnig, and the supercharged Charger. The day when an old $3k RX7 can beat a $140k V12 Ferrari will be the day cows fly. The acting was terrible. It's like watching a movie with robots. There is no character development and they are all about as lively as stones. The music is just terrible for an action movie and the actions scenes have absolutely nothing realistic about them. It is quite apparent that no one involved in the making of this film has ever been to or knows anything about drag racing or cars. Don't waste your time with this movie if can help it.",The Fast and the Furious

The 'plot' was paper-thin; a four-year could determine the outcome within three minutes. The acting, writing, and cinematography were of the lowest caliber. Movies like this, those that are god-awful, but rake in tons of cash, are a cry for help from this generation.

This move is a good film to watch if you are into the car scene as much as i am and also if you like the action genre. Paul walker did an amazing job on this movie, this movie is the reason i first got introduced into him. I soon became a fan of his. The scenes are pretty well done although at some parts you cab tell the voice audio was added in after wards. The music was good and always fit the scenes perfectly. This movie in my opinion was the best one in the entire series. The 7th one has a pretty good place in my heart too seeing it was the last film Paul walker worked on before his passing.all i can say is that this movie has aged well and is one of if not my favorite movie of all time",The Fast and the Furious

Vin is the ultimate bad boy but also the head of the family. Terrific cars scenes and camera angles capturing each rev and turn to its fullest degree. I have to say the beginning of one of the most favorite movie series ever. Timing is everything and the chase and race scenes are packed with so much action it will leave you on the edge. A thrill ride like no other probably the movie that stunned a lot of people with it's plot and smooth rides. If you ever see a movie 2x or more it is most likely this one.",The Fast and the Furious

As opposed to what it actually is, which is an undertorqued, front wheel drive pile of pig feces. Paul Walker and his buddy proved their lack of ability by driving themselves into the crematorium of Valhalla.

798,sanezofficial,Excellent,8,1 November 2017,"""The Fast and the Furious"" is not a great movie, but it delivers what it promises to deliver, and knows that a chase scene is supposed to be about something more than special effects. It has some of that grandiose self-pitying dialogue we've treasured in movies like this ever since ""Rebel Without a Cause."" ""I live my life a quarter-mile at a time,"" Toretto tells Brian. ""For those 10 seconds, I'm free."" And, hey, even for the next 30 seconds, he's decelerating.",The Fast and the Furious

I also love the character Brian, and how he is loyal to Dominic despite everything. Letty is also a great character in the film and I love just how badass she is. She is a take no nonsense badass chick and I think that is just great. This is a great movie overall that is made to be an entertaining action movie. The plot is pretty good overall but what I think is the best part are the action sequences. They really made the action sequences in the film great and they gave them that wow factor.",The Fast and the Furious

I think the movie has a great story line and great acting. It is a very fast paced action movie with a very interesting storyline and as the plot unfolds you get deeper and more into the movie. The cars in it are really cool and I think the movie can to appeal to all action movie lovers! It is also a movie that can be enjoyed by people of many different ages. I have seen it many many times and will continue to watch it often and share it with all of my friends. This is a movie that I would highly recommend because I really enjoy it!,The Fast and the Furious
801,riverfrank,A commonly underrated movie,9,11 July 2006,"This is one of those movies that i start liking when i watched a 2nd time. Maybe the actors are not the best but they are suitable for the characters. This movie is not about telling a story, is about values and friendship, knowing who we are and what are we willing to lose for those values.The fast and the furious is not an usual action movie, not like ""2 fast 2 furious"", the second part of this one, that is actually the most crappy movie i could ever expect after watching the previous part. Maybe all the bad of ""2 fast 2 furious"" has been attached(unjustly) to the first part.Also a lot of races and speed with tuning cars. I highly recommend this movie for tuning lovers.",The Fast and the Furious

Was fun to watch on my own time and didn't have to skip any boring dialogue like i always do.. Paul walker and Vin diesel make a very good combo in the first FnF but i personally think the acting in 2F2F was much betterPros(Things i like).The movie has many race scenes unlike the new FnF movies .Includes a multitude of cars from Japanese tuners to American muscle, .acting was good, as i love paul walker for his acting .You are able to watch the movie without worrying about plot holes as the movie keeps you interested with its race scenes .Excellent choice of music More focus on cars then bank heists and not much of a focus on hot women, however there is the fair share of hotties in the movie .VERY GOOD character development between the MAIN CHARACTERSCons .WARNING, this movie was made by someone who knows nothing about cars, so any car enthusiast may cringe when they see something that happens to a car that is supposed to make a person who knows nothing about cars(which this movie is targeted to) say ""WOW! Cars can do that! So cool!"" .acting may be corny at times .movie ends too fast, leaving little plot holes and poor acting (EX: jesses death"" .Dont get exited about these cool modded cars with bodykits and spoiler, this concept is abandon in the 4th movie (2009) .Most of the side characters are abandon excluding Mia, letty, vince and hector...Overall, really good, but has is mini downsides..",The Fast and the Furious

I have built some hobby type cars for racing, Nothing to serious. And I was always in the mind-set of when you want to go faster in the 1/4 mile the easiest and cheapest way is to remove some weight. Don't get me wrong I enjoy a good system like most. But if I was racing my car I wouldn't have all the weight of the subs amps extra batteries etc. Other than that and some of the cheesy ""hollywood"" lingo about car terms.

It is so action packed, and full of heart pumping scenes. I don't know, maybe you have to be into racing street cars for this to be an awesome movie, but I found it to be incredibly exciting. It made me wish I was in the movie, playing out the same real life scenarios with the actors. It was invigorating. Plus, it's a great movie that girls and guys can watch together. I mean it has the action for the guys, and the hot guys for the girls. It's great, you have to see it at least once. If you don't like it, then well maybe this just isn't your type of movie.",The Fast and the Furious

807,wernerb-3,Point Break with cars,5,10 September 2007,"If you have seen Point Break there is absolutely no need to see this movie. The plot is EXACTLY the same, just substitute the skydiving/surfing with street racing and you have it.Point Break: Undercover FBI agent, Johnny Utah (Keanu Reeves), infiltrates a group of surfers suspected of robbing banks. The group has a very charismatic leader, Bodhi (Patrick Swayze).Fast and the Furious: Undercover cop, Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker), infiltrates a group of street racers suspected of hijacking electronic equipment. The street racer group also has a very charismatic leader, Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel).Point Break: The FBI agent finds himself increasingly attracted to the adrenaline-charged lifestyle of the community he has infiltrated and Bodhi's ex girlfriend. This causes an internal struggle for Utah, as his fondness for the Bodhi and the lifestyle he embodies conflicts with his duty as an FBI agent.Fast and the Furious: The police officer also finds himself increasingly attracted to the adrenaline-charged lifestyle of the street racing community and also has a romantic interest in the form Toretto's younger sister. The lifestyle of Toretto and cronies and said romantic interest again causes, just as in Point Break, a conflict with his duties as a police officer.Point Break: Utah first suspects another group of surfers as the ""Ex-Presidents"" bank robbers and organises a FBI raid on them. He subsequently finds out that they are not the guilty party.Fast and the Furious: O'Conner first suspects another group of racers and orders a raid on them. He subsequently finds out that they are not the guilty party.Point Break: Bodhi and his fellow surfers are the bank robbers, they go for the jackpot and it all goes horribly wrong. Utah, who befriended Bodhi, lets him get away.Fast and the Furious: Toretto and his crew are the hijackers, they also go for ""the jackpot"" and again it goes horribly wrong. O'Conner, who befriended Toretto, lets him get away.You would think that Hollywood actually takes into account that the average person's memory is slightly superior to that of a goldfish.Except for that carbon copy plot I quite enjoyed it and can recommend it for anyone who hasn't seen Point Break.",The Fast and the Furious

It knows exactly what it is and who it caters to and doesnt try to be anything else but an over the top racing flick. If you go into it expecting a deep introspection into Paul Walker's character, you'll be thoroughly disappointed. It's a by the numbers movie and I'm sure it was impressive for the time, but the only way one could find value in The Fast and the Furious is if they grab some friends and turn off their brain for a bit.",The Fast and the Furious
809,skternate,Solid movie... Worth renting,8,21 June 2006,"Today I saw Tokyo drift and yesterday I saw 2 fast 2 furious for the fifth time, but I still find myself drawn toward the original. It stars Paul Walker as an undercover cop who infiltrates the street racing underworld of LA to catch a crook who has been hijacking millions of dollars worth of electronics from 18wheelers, causing the truckers to take matters into their own hands, ultimately ending in deaths and multitudes of money stolen. Now, you would think that because of the semi weak plot, this movie wouldn't be that good, however, the main storyline is just a small part of this movie, the other elements being action and some interesting relationships regarding vin diesels character. Diesel plays a street racing god, one of the best in the LA scene. Walkers character, Brians, way into the world is through Dominic Toretto (Diesel). Toretto has an air about him which draws other in, and Brian is no different. Throughout the movie, Brian is getting to know Dom, earning his trust, etc, but at the end of the movie, both Dom and Brian are forced to make a decision about each other... The whole relationship is interesting to watch. As for the action, there is plenty of it. Besides the many races, there is also some gunplay and some hand to hand fighting, and some interesting hijacking sequences.All in all the cars are hot, the girls are hotter, the cars are fast, the guns are loaded, and for the more serious, the relationship between Dom, Mia, Vince, Letty, and the others is amazing.If you haven't seen this movie, rent it tonight",The Fast and the Furious

This, I guess, is the reason for why someone reader of IMDb commented that in this movie Vin's talent was wasted.

This is an excellent example of the utter contempt that Hollywood shows for its viewers these days. From a totally unbelievable plot line to a multitude of poor acting examples, this movie would actually be worth watching for satire purposes - if it wasn't for the fact that you will waste 90 odd minutes of your life.This movie is a fine example of the 'dumbing down' of audiences worldwide. It is like watching a movie full of 'Fonzie jumping the shark' over and over and will make you wince and feel embarrassed for not only the actors but also the crew who had to sit through this joke of a movie. Actually, I even feel sorry for the people who worked as caterers on this film.

Vin is a big guy and Paul isn't so big...this makes Paul look like a ferocious chihuahua and Diesel a giant rottweiler.I recommend this movie for every Vin Diesel fan, and everyone that is a fan of fast cars.Another thing about this movie was that it was so popular that the police had to actually do more work to keep the kids from speeding.Anyway, the Fast and the Furious is for you if you like action, romance, mystery, and adventure...",The Fast and the Furious
813,joedunks,The OG and the Best,10,20 February 2019,"I'm never one to write reviews, but this film is one of my favorites for multiple reasons. The 2 main characters of Brian and Dom are just a match made in heaven with Paul Walker and Vin Diesel playing them respectively. Jordana Brewster and Michelle Rodriguez fit perfectly as the love interests and are some of the most badass women I've seen in car films. This film is a timeless classic because of the car chases, the chemistry of the actors, and the greatness of the action displayed with the cars. The directing was really well done for a movie of this scope mixing slow motion in some car sequences with the real time effects of the stunts that the cars are undertaking. The music fits the film well, and it maintains the tone of the film superbly.The original of the fast and furious saga definitely set the bar extremely high for the sequels and luckily some of the sequels have been able to reach and some exceed it.
Most of all this movie is special for me because it was influential in my childhood as it was the first PG-13 movie I ever saw as a child (I was 5) lol.
Just an awesome movie all around. Check it out if you've never seen it before.",The Fast and the Furious
