0,MartinHafer,this movie went so wrong!,3,11 July 2006,"Although Michael Keaton and Tim Burton return for this sequel to BATMAN (1989), this movie was a terrible followup to the blockbuster film. While the original film was dark and terribly entertaining, this film was far, far darker and offered little that could be seen as entertaining.Instead of a funny and over-the-top villain like the Joker, this one features Danny DeVito as one of the ugliest and most repellent villains of all time. In addition, the back story just made no sense at all and was just 100% stupid. A horrid couple have a horribly deformed baby. So, they do what most folks would do--chuck the kid in the sewer! There, he is somehow transported to a land where he is raised by animals. Later, he creates an army of evil armed penguins.Now, no matter how good the film is from this point on, the premise and characters are so stupid that it can't help but fail. It's visually impressive but also ugly and nihilistic. After starring in this mess, I can understand why Keaton bowed out of future Batman films.",Batman Returns
1,TheLittleSongbird,"Dark, funny and original. Not as good as the first film, but well worth watching.",8,13 May 2009,"There were a lot of things that were excellent about this movie, like the cinematography and the performances, though it isn't as good as the first film. Michael Keaten is suitably brooding as the Dark Knight, better than George Clooney in Batman and Robin (considered as the worst out the franchise)though he is overshadowed by the villains, namely Danny DeVito as the Penguin, who looked as though he was having a ball, and brought a sense of sadness and grotesquesness to the role. Christopher Walken was effective also as Max Schrek. Stealing the show, with her flawless delivery of not-so special lines, is Michelle Pfeiffer as the sexy and manipulative Catwoman. The film looks lovely, with the sets and effects, and Tim Burton directs with detail. However the film does drag, and while there are some intelligent lines from the villains, the script could have been developed a little more. All in all, a dark and entertaining film. Whereas Batman Forever is funnier and more fast paced, Batman Returns is darker, but just lacks the sophistication of the first film. 8/10 Bethany Cox.",Batman Returns
2,Leofwine_draca,Campy nonsense,4,22 July 2015,"I think Tim Burton's BATMAN movies have dated really badly since their release. I disliked the first film so much so that I never got around to watching this sequel until now, by which time I've been spoilt by the Christian Bale movies. Burton's movies are a cross between the campy tone of the 1960s TV series and the dark seriousness of the Nolan trilogy, but they fall down on both counts.BATMAN RETURNS comes across as a surreal comedy more than anything. That's the only way you can explain the ultra-poor acting of Michelle Pfeiffer as the silliest Catwoman ever; I think even Halle Berry was better than this. Pfeiffer's acting is so grating and hammy that I'm surprised she wasn't nominated for a Razzie award. Danny DeVito is better; he's hammy, yes, but his costume is a character in itself and I think Burgess Meredith would have been proud.Elsewhere, we have a sprawling plot focused around massive set-pieces but a general feel of padding/sleepwalking in between the noisy bits. Keaton's Batman is a bore, overshadowed by the flamboyant villains. Christopher Walken's here, but he gives exactly the same performance as he did in A VIEW TO A KILL, so if you've seen that film you don't need to bother with him in this one. BATMAN RETURNS as a whole has a silly, set-bound, anything-goes style feel to it and you get the impression that Burton's heart wasn't really in it. You know what? Mine wasn't either...",Batman Returns
3,SnoopyStyle,Almost as good with Michelle Pfeiffer licking herself,8,4 January 2014,"Tim Burton returns to direct the second Batman movie. Evil businessman Max Shreck (Christopher Walken) intends to build a 'powerplant' that does nothing but help himself. Danny DeVito plays The Penguin who was abandoned as a baby and now lives in the sewer. Selina Kyle (Michelle Pfeiffer) is the timid assistant to Max Shreck until she discovers his evil plans. He pushes her out the window, and she turns into Catwoman.The Penguin is no Joker. He really isn't anything that could be deemed superior to the Joker. The good thing is that they put in Michelle Pfeiffer as Catwoman. She is much better than all the screaming from Kim Basinger. And the movie still has that Tim Burton style. All in all, it's almost as good as the first Batman movie. The best thing here is Michelle Pfeiffer. Who could ever forget Michelle cleaning herself?",Batman Returns
4,Hitchcoc,Batman Gets the Bird,9,29 December 2016,"This is really quite good with more exposition and character development. We are introduced to two more staples of the Batman stable, the Penguin and Cat Woman. The Penguin's origins are brought forth in this episode as are Cat Woman's. The Penguin is set on taking over the city. There are evil politicians and crooked workers that Bruce Wayne must deal with. The Penguin looks like a lightweight, but he is, indeed a formidable enemy. Batman is immediately struck by the beauty of Cat Woman (played by the stunning Michelle Pfeiffer). The efforts to quell the situation set up by the Penguin and do it quickly, is the problem Batman must face. With Michael Keaton at the helm, Batman is a bit more cynical and harsh. Batman continues to be a force in the film industry to this day. One of the better episodes.",Batman Returns
5,Horst_In_Translation,Gotham Zoo Tycoon,6,11 March 2020,"""Batman Returns"" is an American movie from 1992 that runs for slightly over two hours and is moving closer to its 30th anniversary. It was the second collaboration between director Tim Burton and lead actor Michael Keaton, well actually they have more collaborations, but their second Batman movie. Two other Batman films followed with other directors and leads, but they received a far worse reception than Burton's and Keaton's combined efforts from the early 1990s. But besides Keaton, you will find many other really talented actors in here, such as Oscar winner Christopher Walken. Now I really had to laugh when I saw him the first time here, mostly because of his hair. He plays Max Shreck (not vampire-related) and is maybe the only character who is an antagonist from beginning to end, even if he likes to act as if he was a benefactor and only had the best for Gotham on his mind. But at the end of the film, the only thing he cared for is probably his son as he tried all he could to switch places when his young man is taken hostage by the Penguin. Oh and what a last shot of Walken's character('s corpse). Pretty scary. But also very Burton. Okay I just mentioned the Penguin. Now Catwoman in here may also be a tragic character, but nothing tops the Penguin's tragedy, especially looking at what we find out happened to him as a baby. I liked the parallel between how he is thrown down from the bridge and it is the very same bridge that he jumps from eventually when his plan to have a career as a politician is not working out. He may be bad and a psychopath, but he is also used by Shreck. And then thrown away again. And the fact that he is a psychopath also has a lot to do with what happened to him early on. It is impossible to say what he is doing next. Like when he is treated as inferior by Shreck's two assistants, he bites off basically the man's nose and is lusting over the woman. He may indeed be more of an animal than a human. This is also confirmed by the ending, no his ending, when all his human helpers vanish, but the penguins show up and pay him a last salute. This was honestly almost touching and deep there and once again you can only feel sorry for the Penguin somehow. Sure he contributed to his misery, but he did not create it. It may sound a bit pathetic, but he just wanted to be loved. And I am pretty sure that the search for his parents was not a tactical plan, but he really wanted to know who they were and what happened to them. And even there he suffers a setback because they are both deceased. All he gets is his real name: Oswald Cobblepot. This is also a crucial factor because of how he says that he is not the Penguin, but he is O.C. and finally the other way around when all is lost again. Also pay attention to how this film takes place during the Christmas holidays, before Christmas Eve, and there is snow and ice everywhere, not just down there in the Penguin's hideout, but also up there in Gotham. Certainly a link to this antagonist. Also there is cold weather when his parents get rid of him at the very start and he is ""adopted"" by the penguins. But why oh why are there so many penguins in Gotham's sewers? Now that surprised me a bit. We could have gotten a rat antagonist by realistic standards otherwise. In any case, I thought that DeVito did a magnificent job here and he should have been nominated for an Oscar, not worse than Nicholson in the first film. In general, he should have gotten much more awards recognition and honestly, if there is anything that disqualifies the Razzies, then it is them saying DeVito was bad. It was a really challenging role and for good reason Nolan never touched the Penguin character. Nobody could have played this better than Danny DeVito and I say this although I am not even as much of a DDV fan anymore as I was years ago.Okay I already mentioned that he was really a penguin more than a human and there is a second animal character here, who is more animal than human too eventually. I am of course speaking of Michelle Pfeiffer's Catwoman. She may be antagonistic too at times, but there is also a connection between her and Batman, or rather between their two human forms you could say. That would be more accurate. Now her transformation after Shreck pushes her out of the window is one that reminded me a bit of Spider-Man's. She is dead apparently, but brought back to life by all the cats coming to the occasion, walking over her body, biting her and somehow giving her cat DNA this way and she lives again and has nine lives apparently from that moment on. Or only 8 left. I think they overused this nine lives reference a bit eventually with the several gunshots from Shreck's firearm there. Fantasy does not equal superstition. Anyway, after seeing this film last night (first time on the big screen), I must say I liked Pfeiffer's turn and character more (in the sense I found her more interesting) than the first time I watched the film years ago. Also pay attention to how she falls through a big comic book style cat image before she is resurrected. I guess those cats wanted to give back to her because she cared so much for her own cat before that. She also gets the final reference of the film with the other two antagonists dead as Batman sees her briefly and picks up a stray cat. Was it Selina's own cat? Maybe. My idea there was that they wanted to imply that she no longer lived in her apartment, has become a part of the streets now, a stray cat herself if you want to say so, and she cannot take care of her cat anymore because of that. But there were also weak moments related to Catwoman here and I totally do not see her (or Pfeiffer) as the sex icon many do. The scene when she returns from the dead and shocks Shreck is pretty embarrassing. Three bad moments there. The dialogue in front of the elevator with Wayne, how Wayne is stupid enough to say he knew her already and briefly afterwards also how Shreck is not even scared of admitting to his son he killed her earlier, although maybe the son did not even understand his dad meant it literally because obviously she still exists. But ih he admitted it all, it is nonsense. I mean the two are close, but still... Also the scene later on Kyle and Wayne find out about each other's identity with this particular quote is pseudo important and poorly executed, already the lead-up too with them speaking about losing their masks. The simpler moments where better here like when Catwoman is about to eat the bird. In another scene, Penguin eats the fish. Another piece of evidence of how both have become animals pretty much, even if Catwoman swallows it, but only to save the cat from Penguin.You can see this is a Tim Burton film and not Christopher Nolan. There is some (subtle) comedy in here on many occasions. Like how the really dumb girl is abducted and killed too I think. Or the entire idea of the penguin army going out to destroy Gotham and kill everybody. It was dangerous, but also somewhat funny because of how absurd it all was. By the way, what was up with the idea of turning the Batmobile into a bomb? That was so random and luckily quickly forgotten. Pay attention to the parallel how Penguin tries to frame Batman and make him look evil, but it goes wrong and when Batman does it the other way around, it works out when we hear the evil words from Penguin. Okay, a few minor references now that caught my attention. There is not a great deal of violence in here, or I should say bloodshed. Even when people (or the Penguin himself) fire with automatic guns into crowds, it seems nobody is really hit/hurt and everybody quickly gets up again. Until close to the end when Penguins shoots his helper who dares to disagree with him. And that shows how inhumane Penguin really was by then. And that was a pretty graphic shooting, how he sinks to the ground there, as if they waited for it and built up to it with all the ""minor"" violence. Tim Burton was never a filmmaker known for bloody massacres though and it shows here. This could have been a far more violent movie. Also the penguin's helpers, despite the use of the colors black and white, were mostly clowns that also could have been from the first film supporting the Joker. Or maybe not because they (except Schiavelli's character and the actor is once again so easy to recognize) were rather cult followers than criminals. Shreck is out for almost the entire second half of this film and there is more focus on Kyle's story there. But he returns at the end being a crucial essence of Catwoman's revenge, i.e. the main target. I loved the Penguin, but come on the story that he could really be considered a candidate for mayor is just absurd, only because people liked him and thought he has a good heart with how he wanted to find his parents. Oh there is a global warming mention in here, quite ahead of its time. I thought how Batman really found out about everything evil here, especially the penguin army attack, and managed to prevent it was really a bit fast and rushed and he looked too competent there. It did not feel too credible. They could have done a better job with regard to that. Still interesting how remote control was a factor there too like it was also with the Batmobile earlier. Okay, this would be all that comes to mind. It's enough I think. DeVito deserves 4 stars out of 5 and the film itself too during its best moments, but overall I say 3 out of 5 is pretty accurate. This deserves (even with how old it is) to be seen by many more than the three people (including myself) who were there during my showing. If you haven't, go for it. It is good quality and nice to see it received two Oscar nominations. Not undeserving. Oh yeah, as for the title of my review, there is so much here: penguins, cats, monkeys, bats (obviously) probably more. Animal kingdom. And again, why are there penguins in the sewers??? Haha okay I'll stop.",Batman Returns
6,classicsoncall,"""What do you say we take off our costumes?""",7,22 March 2014,"A couple decades ago when this film came out, I thought the Batman series of films was generally OK. Watching them today I'm left in complete disbelief over how over the top and silly the characters and stories are. DeVito does a good job in portraying the hideous villain in this one, but gosh, the Penguin is absolutely disgusting. Those close-ups of him eating raw fish and oozing blood out of his mouth are gag inducing, making it utterly unbelievable that this was a serious contender for mayor of Gotham City. What were they thinking? Say, do you know there was a real person named Max Schreck? He was a German silent film actor who portrayed the very first movie vampire in 1922's ""Nosferatu"", one of my favorite classics. So I wonder if Christopher Walken's character in the picture was inspired by the real deal. Interestingly, the word 'schreck' is German for terror, so there may be something to it.As a comic book Batman fan, I can't get too worked up over this picture. Michael Keaton is not my idea of a suitable Bruce Wayne OR Batman actor, and the design of the bat-suit for the movies is too bulky and gawky for me. Seeing a whole closet full of them here was a bit of a surprise, not to mention the accessories. I guess I just never thought about it before; all that high flying action probably causes some damage every now and then.One thing the movie managed to remind me of today is just how long global warming hysteria has been around. An entire new generation has now been propagandized to believe that Man has something to do with impacting the weather. The Penguin's off the cuff remark to 'stop global warming and start global cooling' was almost up to speed in 1992; the world's mean temperature hasn't changed one bit in the last seventeen years as I write this.With a quick nod to Michelle Pfeiffer as a sexy Selina Kyle/Catwoman, that's about as much faint praise I can give the film, and even there I have to hold back. The picture's dialog is filled with double entendres and sexual references, and to my thinking, brings down it's value as family entertainment. I'd rather think of my super-heroes as being more traditional and conservative. But I'll hand it to Max Schreck, even as a greedy capitalist, he fully realized that an economy with one percent growth like we have today simply sucks.",Batman Returns
7,gavin6942,Still a Great Film,7,8 December 2013,"When a corrupt businessman (Christopher Walken) and the grotesque Penguin (Danny DeVito) plot to take control of Gotham City, only Batman (Michael Keaton) can stop them, while the Catwoman (Michelle Pfeiffer) has her own agenda.First of all, this cast is amazing. Setting aside the supporting actors (including the great Paul Reubens), the four key roles make this an instant classic for any movie fan, regardless of their love of Batman.But also, I think Tim Burton ""got"" Batman in a way no other director has. Christopher Nolan's films may be the best from a critical standpoint, but Burton's are best at visually blending the comics and reality. His world is dark, but still fun. Nolan's Gotham is a hopeless land.",Batman Returns
8,lee_eisenberg,"well, we all know what it is",7,13 July 2005,"Both ""Batman"" and ""Batman Returns"" show that the franchise was best when Tim Burton directed and Michael Keaton starred (I haven't seen ""Batman Begins"", but in ""Batman Forever"", Jim Carrey stole the show, and ""Batman and Robin"" was atrocious at best). Everyone knows the story: the Caped Crusader (Michael Keaton) battles the Penguin (Danny DeVito) and Catwoman (Michelle Pfeiffer), while Christopher Walken plays the corrupt Max Schreck.Maybe this movie has no real artistic value, but it's still pretty good. The Penguin had some neat tricks up his sleeve, and I really liked the scene where Bruce Wayne messed up Penguin's speech. Cool.",Batman Returns
9,jboothmillard,Batman Returns,9,24 February 2005,"The caped crusader, or dark knight whatever you call him has returned to Gotham City. Michael Keaton is back as Batman in this sequel to the 1989 original with the same director Tim Burton (Beetlejuice, Edward Scissorhands, Sleepy Hollow, Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street). Unfortunately most of the best lines are stolen by the villains. Danny DeVito dominates the film as the evil Penguin who is trying to learn his past and change his future, while at the same time framing Batman. There is also the appearance of Michelle Pfeiffer as the curvaceous and mysterious Catwoman. Also plotting to take over the city with the help of the Penguin is the popular Christopher Walken. Also starring Pat Hingle as Comissioner Gordon, Michael Gough as Alfred and Vincent Schiavelli as Organ Grinder. An interesting sequel, not as much magic like the original and a bit darker, but still a very good classic. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Visual Effects and Best Makeup, and it was nominated the BAFTAs for Best Make Up Artist and Best Special Effects. Batman was number 46 on 100 Years, 100 Heroes & Villains, and he was number 84 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons. Very good!",Batman Returns
10,ccthemovieman-1,The Good & Bad Of 'Batman Returns',8,30 November 2006,"For a long time, this was my favorite of the Batman films. It had the best cinematography and an edgy feel to it with two wild characters - Catwomen and The Penguin - along with the always-interesting Christopher Walken. However, after the last viewing it finally slipped in my ratings and, frankly, I now prefer the last Batman: Batman Begins, with Christian Bale.THE GOOD - Nonetheless, this is still the most intriguing of the five latter-day Batman films. The stylish cinematography in here is the best of any of the Batman movies. Director Tim Burton is known for his films which feature stunning visuals, as this is a great example. The three characters listed above are all very different and very interesting, almost fascinating. Of the villains, I preferred Catwomen, finding her the most fun to watch before and after she changed. Violence is not overdone here as it was in several of the other Batman stories but one is never bored watching this. As he did in the first film, Michael Keaton does a fine job playing Batman/Bruce Wayne.THE BAD - For a movie based on a comic strip that mostly kids read, I still think these first two Batman movies, both done by Burton, were too dark and the profanity was definitely not appropriate. Although, unlike the first movie, there was no usage of the Lord's name in vain in here, there still was profanity and both villains made too many sexual remarks. That would have been okay if they hadn't marketed this film for kids as well as adults. Danny DeVito's ""Penguin"" is downright gross in spots. ""Grotesque"" I can handle, but who wants ""gross."" Few guys, meanwhile, complained about the beautiful Michelle Pfeiffer playing Catwoman. Generall too much darkness and some cheap shots on Christian- bashing also made me re-consider my previously-high rating of this film.OVERALL - Fabulous visuals and memorable characters make this the most interesting in the Batman series, but too-dark an edge, too gross and too much anti-religious bias all finally turned me off after a half-dozen looks at this film. Sorry, but I prefer a kinder-gentler Batman movie. After all, it's just a cartoon. Most will disagree, but I was glad to see the series lighten up after this one.",Batman Returns
11,rmax304823,Was He Ever GONE?,6,3 July 2016,"Gotham City is a majestic presence in this movie. It looks lavish enough for its budget to have fed the entire population of Upper Volta for a year.I kind of like it, mostly because it featured two of my costars, Michael Keaton in the superb art-house hit, ""Squeeze,"" and Pat Hingle, who was my supporting player in the memorable, umm, whatever it was. It will come when it will come.Keaton is laid back, even a bit sluggish, as Bruce Wayne. Danny DeVito as the Penguin is not at all sluggish. He waddles around in a fat suit and wears enough makeup to disguise his human identity. Michelle Pfeiffer makes a sleek Cat Woman in a black plastic outfit. Christopher Walken in a gray wig stands out as a corrupt mayor. Christopher Walken always stands out.But what's it all about? It's all full of fireworks but it's not the Fourth of July, just a run of the mill Tuesday or something. Is it supposed to be sufficiently entertaining just to look at movie stars in costumes running around in expensive sets? I only ask because there's not much more to the film than that. And if that's your pleasure, you'll certainly find it here.",Batman Returns
12,Tweekums,"Batman comes up against the diabolical Penguin and a slinky, kinky Cat Woman",9,2 April 2017,"Thirty Three years ago the deformed baby, later identified as Oswald Cobblepot, was thrown into a stream and floated into the sewers. Here he was raised by penguins and now as an adult he wants to return and find out who he really is. Meanwhile businessman Max Shreck is pressuring the mayor to allow him to build a new power plant for Gotham. Shreck is due to turn on the city's Christmas lights but the ceremony is interrupted by a nightmarish group of clowns and acrobats and Shreck is captured by their leader; Cobblepot, who is now known as The Penguin. He knows Shreck's dark secrets and blackmails him into helping him become a respected citizen. He isn't the only person to learn Shreck's secret; his timid secretary learns one too but he pushes her through a window. She doesn't die but she is changed less timid and somewhat demented she makes herself a masked costume and becomes the Cat Woman. Of course it will be up to Batman to deal with these threats and ultimately make an unlikely alliance to save Gotham.The previous film in the franchise may have been dark compared to the '60s TV series but it still had a fair degree of camp this is much darker and to my mind better. Danny DeVito's Penguin is a vile creature; physically repulsive but also bitter and rather perverse. Christopher Walken is suitably wicked as Shreck as he manages to stay just the right side of becoming a pantomime villain. Michelle Pfeiffer is suitably sexy and confident as Cat Woman in a delightfully kinky costume as well as being believable as the timid Selina. Michael Keaton is also impressive as he returns in the role of Batman. The story itself is decent although it mainly serves to deliver a variety of enjoyable set-pieces where the bad guys to bad things and Batman tries to stop then. The dark tone and general nastiness of some of the characters means it won't be suitable for younger viewers but I'd still recommend it to older Batman fans.",Batman Returns
13,BA_Harrison,Burton Bores.,3,24 June 2017,"In the first Tim Burton Batman movie, Jack Nicholson stole almost every scene he was in as The Joker, but the film was still very much about Batman.Three years later, and Batman returned, but on the strength of this sequel, perhaps it would have been better if he had remained hidden away in his bat cave.Nowhere near as much fun as his original, Tim Burton's follow up focuses less on the bat and more on the villains: the Penguin (Danny De Vito), who emerges from the sewers, ostensibly to discover who is parents were, but in reality, to wreak terror on the people of Gotham City, with a little help from unscrupulous industrialist Max Schreck (Christopher Walken). And Catwoman, psycho secretary Selina Kyle, who loses her marbles and turns nasty after being pushed out of a window by Schreck.Michael Keaton, as Batman, hardly gets a look in.As well as featuring not nearly enough of its hero, the film also suffers from an air of unrelenting grotesqueness (Burton going overboard on the freaky stuff), a really drab aesthetic (the winter setting leading to lots of dreary grey and blue visuals), and a boring plot in which the Penguin runs for mayor. At over two hours long, I felt my eyelids drooping a lot.4/10, minus one point for Walken's crazy hair and the unconvincing mechanical penguins/men in penguin costumes, some of the Stan Winston Studio's worst work.",Batman Returns
14,moonspinner55,Too many grotesques in the kitchen...,4,10 February 2007,"Tim Burton's follow-up to his own 1989 hit ""Batman"" has Michael Keaton returning as reclusive millionaire Bruce Wayne who doubles as crime-fighter Batman; here, Gotham City is in the middle of a political shakedown, as former circus freak/now celebrity extraordinaire Oswald Cobblepot (a.k.a. The Penguin) has teamed with business tycoon Max Shreck into persuading the residents that he should be the next mayor (apparently no one has noticed the Penguin's henchmen terrorizing all the small businesses on Gotham's mean streets). Meanwhile, Shreck's secretary has learned too much and is pushed from a high window--her life is saved by mystical alley cats and she emerges with a new identity, Catwoman, but with no discernible agenda of her own. This overstuffed live-action comic book adventure features lots of dumb-funny double entendres and the overused plot-device of having the number one crime-fighter look like a dupe at the hands of the villains (they even manage to rewire the Batmobile so that it mows down pedestrians!). However, the picture has drive and imagination to spare, and for about an hour it's a fun ride. Still, Burton's wintry atmosphere and bleak vision of the City as Hell becomes wearing, and by the finale nearly all the juice has leaked from this vehicle. ** from ****",Batman Returns
15,dbdumonteil,the hero's return,7,9 September 2004,"With ""Batman Returns"", Tim Burton succumbed to an important priority in American cinema: giving a sequel to a blockbuster. Three years after the most successful movie of the year, ""Batman"" (1989), here comes the hero of Gotham City again for the pleasure of many spectators. Like its predecessor, ""Batman Returns"" enjoyed an enormous commercial success. Tim Burton made Batman come back once again because it is to believe that the victory of the latter on his enemy the Joker did little to improve the image of Gotham City. Indeed, violence and corruption still exist and here, the second word is epitomized by Max Shreck (Christopher Walken) and the penguin (Danny De Vito). These two crooks who are eager to take control of Gotham City are going to make life difficult for Batman. His task will be more difficult with the apparition of Catwoman... Tim Burton still delivered much work on the scenery and it seems that he tried to correct the faults of the first movie. It means that the director gave way to fight sequences which are better mastered than in the first Batman. But he didn't neglect the psychology of his main characters for all that. If in the movie of 1989, Burton had focused on Bruce Wayne/Batman's psychology, here, it's the penguin that obviously interested him. The director attempted to make of him, very well acted by De Vito an ambiguous character. On one hand, he's full of bad intentions (previously quoted) but on the other hand, he's searching for his past and would like to be considered as a real man.""Batman Returns"" also appears as crazier than its predecessor, especially with the cast. I think of Michèle Pfeiffer who offers a daring and powerful performance as Catwoman. Besides, at the time when I'm writing this review, it makes me remember that a new version of Catwoman is currently at the cinema. But given the bad reviews (3 out of 10 on IMDb!), it is sure that her performer Halle Berry must pale into insignificance beside Pfeiffer.Ultimately, this film is one of the best sequels of 1992 and it enables to develop Tim Burton's peculiar style. We also still find his taste for the strange and the Gothic. Concerning Batman's other adaptations for the screen, you can skip them. ""Batman Forever"" (1995) and ""Batman and Robin"" (1997) are no good. I heard that Christopher Nolan was shooting the beginning of the Batman story and it was to be released next year. Will it match Tim Burton's works?",Batman Returns
16,Quinoa1984,"seen years later, a rare sequel that's better as an adult then as a kid",10,25 July 2000,"I'm not gonna lie, for a while I was a bit down on Tim Burton's own sequel of his 1989 classic post-modern adaptation of the the dark knight. It was mostly in due to feeling that the script was weak, with dialog WAY over the top, and an overall appeal that just at times seemed either too serious for its own good or too hokey (I mean, penguins doing what they do in their final moments in the film, who'd of thunk). But seeing the film years later, as Batman Begins now has its mark in the comic-book world, I've found a greater appreciation for it and Burton's vision. It's actually one of the best of the franchise, a given to be better than the Schumacher films, but with an added appeal after seeing countless other films since taking this is as a kid.Even as it isn't necessarily great, it has brilliant things about it, from its lavish and spooky production design (hell of a way to make that Penguin lair), fantastic make-up, and twists that have a perverse fascination here and there as a blockbuster entertainment. I'm also very fond of the performances I see again. Keaton still has that deadpan style as Batman that works (even if he's lesser as Bruce Wayne); Pfieffer is the best that could be done with Catwoman; De Vito stand out and occasionally steals scenes as Oswald Cobblepot (his plight is almost the most poetically tragic of the series, however if not the best as a villain); Christopher Walken is, well Christopher Walken in one of the lesser of the over-the-top roles he's done.But maybe most of all that has me gravitating more to Batman Returns as one of the better sequels of the 90's is how much of Burton's vision makes it to the screen, and how his control over the material is present throughout very strongly, as the sense of humor is either very dark or just very silly (in a good way, ""My Babies!"" Penguin cries out looking on at his confused penguins). And Danny Elfman's music is one of his best, at being at times eerily somber but with that Gothic edge the material needs. Plus, Burton understands a slight 'camp' element to what the Batman world might have, but doesn't overplay it like Schumacher did.

17,sunwarrior13,More Focus On The Villains Than Batman,10,15 September 2012,"Batman Returns is a film directed by Tim Burton. Based on the DC Comics character Batman, it is a sequel to 1989's Batman. Michael Keaton reprises the title role of Bruce Wayne/Batman, Pat Hingle returns as Commissioner Gordon, and Michael Gough returns as Wayne's butler Alfred Pennyworth. The film introduces the characters of Max Shreck,portrayed by Christopher Walken, a megalomaniac business tycoon who teams up with the deformed and deranged Penguin,played by Danny DeVito, to take over Gotham City, as well as the character of Catwoman,played by Michelle Pfeiffer, a wronged secretary named Selina Kyle with mixed motives regarding the Dark Knight.In this film, the Caped Crusader is up against the Penguin, the hideously deformed scion of a wealthy Gotham City family. The Penguin plots with evil businessman Max Schreck to become mayor and then turn Gotham into a cathedral of crime. Upon overhearing these plans, Schreck's mousy secretary Selena Kyle is tossed from a high-rise window by her boss. Rescued by a covey of kittens, Selena transforms into the leather-clad Catwoman. In this guise, she teams with the Penguin and Schreck to divvy up their ill-gotten gains and help discredit Batman-but she also has her own scores to settle.This is less of a sequel than reworking of the first film's themes, with greater attention paid to the villains and more visually inventive set pieces, albeit contained in a less coherent work.Also,the villains' stories put Batman out of the picture and the focus of the movie.But nevertheless,this is an indirect reason why the movie worth watching. Also,the flawless casting of Danny DeVito as The Penguin and Christopher Walken as Max Schreck make the sequel better than the first.",Batman Returns

19,hitchcockthelegend,"""Dear Penguin. The children regret they are unable to attend - Batman.""",7,30 April 2010,"Having seen off the evil Joker, the Caped Crusader now has to deal with with two other deadly foes to keep Gotham City safe. The crazy mutant like Penguin and the power crazy megalomaniac in waiting Max Shreck. But wait, just who is this women dressed up like a cat? Friend or Foe? Seems the Dark Knight has a lot on his hands this Christmas.In 1989 director Tim Burton rekindled the super hero genre for Warner Brothers with his take on Batman. Made for $35 million, recouping over that in its opening weekend, the film went on to make a Worldwide profit of over $375 million. The sequel of course was inevitable, as was the return of Burton, even if he dallied around trying to bluff that he would only return if a script was fresh and exciting. Sure enough, and with Burton getting the script he wanted from Daniel Waters, Batman Returns turned over a profit of over $185 million. Thus ensuring that further franchise instalments were to follow, even if, as it turned out, Burton didn't.Batman Returns is more breezy than its predecessor, not in humour terms, but in action. In fact for a genre so steeped in sense of humour, Returns is surprisingly devoid of comedy. A charge of both Burton & Waters taking things a little too seriously is hard to argue against. But that's not to decry the good things that run abound in the film. Burton's trademark Gothics exist all told, and it has its darkness, both in themes and in actual visuals. All of course accompanied by a whirling Danny Elfman score. But what of the story itself? Well this perhaps would have been better served as being titled something along the lines of ""The Penguin Cometh,"" for make no fish bones about it, this is the Penguin movie. Batman and Catwoman are in essence just playing henchman and henchwoman, with Max Shrek serving only as plot device that's saying the real villains of our world don't wear masks or costumes. A bold move by Burton to have the Penguin as the lead protagonist, one that financially paid off. But one that ultimately turned many away from revisits for its perceived un- family friendly being. Guilty as charged said Burton, it's his vision and he stands by it. Thus Batman Returns stands up as the most adult of the four Batman movies made in the modern wave from 1989 to 1997. Quite a feat when you consider the film is set during the bastion of all family holidays! Sadly what was to follow would be kiddie friendly fodder served up by Joel Schumacher-reaching a crushing and chronic nadir with Batman & Robin.The cast are mostly excellent, Keaton does what he can in what is ultimately now a cog in a big wheel role. While Max Shreck gets to play Christopher Walken with relish and oratory menace (yes I did it on purpose). However, it's with Michell Pfeiffer's Catwoman & Danny Devito's Penguin that the film reaches its acting heights. Pfeiffer plays it mousey for Selina Kyle and then leaps at the chance to vamp it up as the delicious Catwoman. With a sultry miaow here and a tippy tappy skip there, this Cat is all in one sexy and very dangerous, something poor Bats is going to have to contend with. But it's DeVito's show all the way. Charged with having to follow Jack Nicholson's film stealing turn from the first film, DeVito immerses himself in the role of the pathetic, deformed, yet dangerously criminal Penguin. It's a monstrous creation fit to grace any modern day horror movie, with DeVito's physicality proving a necessity for the mutant flippered one who was raised in the sewers. If only Danny had been given more opportunities like this to show his talent.There's many missteps in here too, though. Burton is no master of directing action, and some of the one liners shoe-horned in are poor and pointless. While the whole birth of Catwoman story arc just isn't explained in any way. In fact it's all a bit lazy in truth. Burton though, remains a film maker with his own visual flair, his layering of atmosphere as Gotham is on the brink of collapse is expertly crafted. He has stuff to say and he's going to have fun saying said stuff. Often frustrating he can be for sure, but always he carries a uniqueness into many of his films. Batman Returns is no different in that respect. 7/10",Batman Returns
20,Doylenf,Burton's dark vision of Batman's Gotham City is impressive...,7,10 February 2007,"Tim Burton creates a dark vision of Gotham City and its inhabitants with BATMAN RETURNS, which begins with a stunning opening sequence with a freakish infant being disposed of by cruel parents, all to the pulsating and powerful score by Danny Elfman that sets the mood for the rest of the film.MICHAEL KEATON returns for his second turn in the Batman role, convincing whether he's playing Bruce Wayne or the masked crusader; MICHELLE PFEIFFER has a grand time in her dual role as Selena, the mousy secretary afraid to express an opinion or the aggressive, sensuous and sinewy Catwoman who finds a willing opponent and lover in Batman, a love/hate relationship that builds to a frantic finale. The wonderful MICHAEL GOUGH is Alfred, Batman's faithful, wise and all knowing manservant. And, of course, DANNY deVITO gets a huge share of the spotlight as the villainous Penguin, conspiring with power hungry Max Schreck (CHRISTOPHER WALKEN) to get rid of their opponent, Batman.While all the performances are right on target, it's the special effects and sets that dominate the story with its mean and twisted nature sharply accented by the dark foreboding appearance of Gotham City, its Herald Square resembling a bleak counterpoint to New York City's Rockefeller Center. MICHAEL MURPHY and PAT HINGLE are present in minor roles but the film is carried by Keaton, Pfeiffer and DeVito.The screenplay is about as dark and mean spirited as you can get with comic book material, but it's the dazzling production design that gets the attention all the way through, usually on the sinister and somber side. There's a nightmarish quality to some of the action scenes and Burton, of course, is a master at this sort of thing.All told, a very enjoyable take on the Batman legend, dark to be sure but never dull with lots of juicy dialog for clever exchanges between Batman and Catwoman in their game of oneupmanship. MICHELLE PFEIFFER is especially good at capturing the dual nature of her role--and makes a stunning Catwoman with a whip. MICHAEL KEATON is not an actor I personally would immediately think of casting as Batman, but he does extremely well in the role.Summing up: Dazzling sets, good script and Danny Elfman's mesmerizing score are a solid combination to make this Batman a worthwhile viewing experience.",Batman Returns
21,preppy-3,Visually impressive...but that's it,6,11 February 2007,"The Pengiun (Danny DeVito) and evil millionaire Max Schreck (Christopher Walken) team up to rule Gotham City. Batman (Michael Keaton) tries to stop them. He also has to deal with Catwoman (Michelle Pfeiffer) who has ideas of her own.Dark and pretty sick sequel to the 1989 ""Batman"". For starters the villains are pretty silly. DeVito is in an obvious fat suit as the Penguin and his character is needlessly grotesque. Walken sleep walks through his role (as always). Pfeiffer REALLY tries (and looks great in that costume) but her character goes all over the place and acts real strange (even for a Tim Burton film). Keaton is miscast--but he IS good. The movie is filled with stupid one liners which come out of nowhere and seem totally out of place in this context. The tone of the movie keeps switching gears--from comedy, to action, to horror, to romance--erratically. Also Batman kills two people (!!!), little babies are kidnapped and/or put in danger, the sexual aggressiveness of Catwoman is REALLY strong (for a PG-13 movie), the Penguin bites somebody on the nose and people are casually killed left and right. The story also ceases to make sense at certain points and goes barreling out of control by the end. I mean--penguins with BOMBS on their backs invading Gotham City? Come on! Director Tim Burton seems only concerned about production design and special effects. They are impressive (especially Wayne Manor) but swallow the story and the actors. Also the constant dark tone and cruelness really wears one down after a while. I kept watching but the darkness of this one was really too strong--this deserved an R rating.This was a big hit but parents who saw it with their children were (understandably) outraged and bombarded Warner Bros. with letters and calls. Because of that Burton had no hand in ""Batman Forever"" (the next movie). I do think Batman movies should be dark but not at the expense of characters and plot lines. And did Burton really think it was wise to have so much violence in a film children were going to see? And Batman should not kill. I give this a 6 for production design alone. Don't let little kids see this.",Batman Returns

It can, at times, be Captivating as well as Cringe-Inducing.If Burton Dialed the Penguin just a Notch above 10, and He did, it is the Film's Only Detraction from this Bizarre Bat-Fest. Everyone in the Movie is a Side-Show Attraction (except Alfred). The Penguin says to Batman...""You're just jealous because I'm a real Freak and You have to wear a mask"".In Fact this Movie was so Disturbing that McDonald's Dropped the Happy Meal Toy Tie-In after Complaints from Outraged ""Goody-Goodies"". The Distributors of Mystery Meat and Fake Food had a lot of Nerve but the Studio seemed to Capitulate as can be Witnessed by the Next Two Batman Movies that were more Friendly to the Franchise of Fast Food.This is a Witty Movie with a Very Sexy Kitty, Michelle Pfeiffer as Catwoman, who Steals the Show from Batman, still with some Wonderful Toys, and The Penguin, although Danny Devito is Unforgettable and Delivers such a Disgusting, Demented, Character that He too is Memorable.Overall, the Movie may be a Bit Better than Batman, as this Followup is Richer, Funnier, and Crackles with a Bombardment of Bold, Burlesque, and Bawdy Behaviour. It is Alive with the Stench of the Near Dead and Dying, the Misfitted and the Maladjusted.

23,utgard14,"""I was their number one son and they treated me like number two.""",7,24 April 2014,"My brother and I walked out of the theater in 1992 feeling like our souls had just been crushed. We had both loved Batman so we eagerly anticipated its sequel and we came away disappointed by what seemed like a bloated mess of a sequel with too many villains, too much humor, and no clear focus. We also both hated the Max Shreck character played by Christopher Walken and felt he was just in the way of things. Time has altered my opinions on this film a great deal but I include my initial teenage reaction for comparison. I still feel it's a flawed movie and one that often feels more like a director's cut than your average edited-down theatrical release. As a whole, I'm not sure the narrative of the movie is at all times clear and a lot of that does have to do with juggling several plot lines and main characters. I'm still not entirely convinced Christopher Walken is necessary to the movie at all, though like most people I do enjoy his performance. Which is kind of my opinion on Batman Returns in a nutshell: there's a lot to enjoy but on the whole it's a movie that could stand a good trimming.Michael Keaton is a very good Batman. Perhaps the best ever. But once again, the focus is on the villains. Danny DeVito's Penguin is gruesome and miles apart from his comic book counterpart. I never really had a problem with this as I always thought the Penguin was a lame villain anyway. At least DeVito's is scary. There's also a good deal of dark humor to be had with him and some camp value, such as his assault on Gotham with penguins mounted with missiles. That part's admittedly more adorable than exciting, though. Michelle Pfeiffer's sexy Catwoman has become an iconic movie character in her own right; the standard by which all other Catwomen are judged. So far they've come up short. She has many of the movie's best lines. Christopher Walken is amusing in that Walken way as an original character for the film, Max Shreck.Even more so than the first film, Tim Burton creates a film full of amazing visuals and eye-popping special effects. At times decidedly campy, it never crosses the line that Joel Schumacher's repulsively gaudy films did. The only real problem with the movie, like I said before, is that it feels overstuffed with ideas and characters. While I believe Max Shreck could have been eliminated and the movie would not have been hurt at all, I think you could have kept him and still helped the movie out by editing some scenes down and quickening the pace a bit. Still, it's a fantastic sequel with great style and atmosphere. Memorable character and set designs, special effects, and good performances all around. It's too flawed to be considered Burton's masterpiece (at least in my opinion) but it's also too impressive to be ignored.",Batman Returns
24,Boba_Fett1138,Great entertainment!,7,26 December 2005,"""Batman Returns"" is very entertaining as a movie and is professionally made with some big talents both in front and behind the cameras. Still the movie goes a bit too far at times and becomes utterly ridicules, even for Tim Burton standards.I'm a big fan of Tim Burton's style so this movie certainly is not a disappointment to me. The movie has this typical and unique crazy look that distinct Tim Burton movies from others. There also are some typical, crazy like Tim Burton characters in this movie, such as the main villains (Penguin, Max Shreck) and especially the bizarre red triangle circus gang. The end result of all those odd and unique things combined, works surprising well and entertaining as a movie, that is watchable for all, so you don't really have to be a Tim Burton fan to fully enjoy this movie.The story is very simple and because of that it also gets quite ridicules at times, especially toward the ending with the Penguin when the movie loses most of its credibility. The whole duality between the Bruce Wayne and Batman character is highly underdeveloped in this movie and the character of Bruce Wayne is totally uninteresting in this movie, as is Alfred, who both had some good scene's together in ""Batman"".The new characters in this movie are a welcome addition to the Batman movie franchise. Christopher Walken and Danny DeVito are both wonderful as the new 'villains', whose characters are really deepened out good enough and are quite humane. But there, also at the same time, lies another small problem I had with this movie. The villains weren't stereotypical villainous enough. Christopher Walken just plays a 'normal' businessman and Penguin is more tragic than he is villainous. Oh, well guess I was just expecting another villainous Joker like character(s) in this movie. Also a welcome addition is Michelle Pfeiffer as Catwoman. She is surprising good and believable in her role and she plays a memorable impressive character and not just only memorable because of the way she looks.The action is good and there are some good fight sequences. There also are some good new cool Batmobile tricks in this movie. I really want a Batmobile for Christmas now!The musical score from Danny Elfman is wonderfully present again in this movie which certainly adds to the mood and atmosphere of the movie in a positive way. The good action-editing is from specialist Chris Lebenzon.All to together its a wonderful and good looking action movie, that is very entertaining to watch, time after time without ever loosing any of its power or entertainment value. This is mainly thanks to the new characters that are in this movie and the lively directing from Tim Burton.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Batman Returns
25,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,"Maybe more Burton than Batman, but an exciting visual feast from start to finish",7,8 December 2007,"What got Tim Burton to come back to the Batman franchise as a director was, at least in part, being offered doing a ""Burton"" film. His kind of film. The comic book roots are still visible, but the touch of the man definitely shines through. The Gothic visuals are a definite plus, and really work well with the characters(whom Burton treats with the right amount of screen-time each... it's note-worthy that the first character seen who links this to the first film *isn't* the title character). The grotesque villains and imagery works as well as it did in the first film, although it may at times become silly. The development is quite good, and this manages to provide motivation for several main characters. It also keeps to a quite high pace, without being overwhelming or hurried. The acting is great. For almost all of the film, I wasn't thinking that I was watching Danny DeVito portray The Penguin... I was watching The Penguin. He disappeared into that role. Michelle Pfeiffer does marvelous as both Kyle and Catwoman(and this one actually uses a *real* whip), and also shines in all her scenes(and her on-screen growth and transformation is an accomplishment). Keaton brings the Bat alive again, and does well as Bruce Wayne, too. Walken is creepy as usual, and he really adds to the film. The dialog is well-written and equally well-delivered, throughout. The humor is just about perfect, it never goes too far, and never tries too hard, but the film definitely delivers some (intentional) laughs. The plot, while it does perhaps suffer from what appears to be interference by the studio to keep the character of Harvey Dent out of the film, is magnificent. It all comes together and works. The production design is excellent. The sets, the costumes, props, everything. The film is dark, the tone and feel, throughout. It is most definitely *not* for children. The sexuality and violence alone should tell anyone that. The special effects are expertly done throughout. The direction, cinematography and editing are excellent. This may not be quite as much of an achievement as the first, and have fewer iconic shots and details, but it is definitely a worthy sequel. You may also want to give the commentary track, by Burton, a listen. I recommend this to any fan of the first, the characters, and the people involved in putting this on the big screen. 7/10",Batman Returns
26,view_and_review,Batman in Fine Form,7,9 April 2020,"Don't get me wrong, ""Batman Returns"" aka Batman 2 is a good movie and a fine sequel, but what kind of nemesis is a penguin? Really DC, what were you thinking? Penguins do not conjure up any kind of frightening thoughts. Granted, The Penguin (Danny Devito), had sharp teeth and a nasty attitude, but he's just trying to make an adorable animal more menacing. What's next, a killer koala?The Penguin (Danny DeVito) was born Oswald Cobblepot. He was born into a wealthy family, but his parents clearly didn't want him. So, much like Moses's mother did with him, but with far less maternalistic aims, they put him in a stream to land God knows where.The message from that action was clear: every bad guy has a tragic backstory. Pretty much all comics profligate the idea that there's no bad guy except that he could've been good had he/she not been wronged at one time. Look at Catwoman (Michelle Pfeiffer), she was forged from similar fires. Batman (Michael Keaton), on the other hand, rose above the tragedy that could've made him a lot worse. Perhaps the guidance of Alfred helped him.In ""Batman Returns"" Gotham is plagued by two and a half menaces. Gotham, as always, has a crime problem and two individuals sought a way to exploit that while a third was only half bad. Max Schrek (Christopher Walken) was a business tycoon that used every unethical method to achieve success. The Penguin wanted to be accepted and revered. And Catwoman just had a vendetta.To get where they wanted to go they would have to contend with Batman, of course. To help The Penguin get Batman out of the way was Catwoman aka Selina Kyle. She rocked the lycra before Trinity of ""The Matrix"". The cat and the bat were never real enemies though they pawed each other. There was too much animal attraction between them to be ardent enemies.Burton and Keaton were a good tandem once again after having done ""Batman"" and ""Beetlejuice"". Maybe the key is movies beginning with ""B"". Though dark, as in unlit, it didn't carry a dark tone (Batman would get a lot darker under Christopher Nolan). There was minimal killing and the criminals were largely upbeat. How can acrobatic clowns look sinister? ""Batman Returns"" carried the same overall vibe that it carried in the first ""Batman"" which I would characterize as light darkness. It was a strong storyline with the only hiccup being the creation of Catwoman (falling out of a building and having cats lick you back to life doesn't create villains, it creates paraplegics). Still, ""Batman Returns"" was a decent addition to the franchise.",Batman Returns
27,neil-476,Hindsight reveals its flaws,7,22 June 2011,"At a time when we were starved of superhero movies, Tim Burton's Batman Returns followed his Batman and was a second oasis in the middle of the desert. And, as with the first (and as is the case with all Burton's movies), production design was a great strength - this film looks terrific.A critical retrospective examination reveals flaws, however. Keaton's Bruce Wayne/Batman is still a terrific portrayal, flawed only by Keaton's diminutive stature. Danny DeVito's Penguin and Michelle Pfeiffer's Catwoman are both interesting interpretations, and visually fascinating, although I'm not sure this version of the Penguin works for me.Christopher Walken, always good value as a baddie, is one villain too many, however, and my main criticism of the first film - an over-emphasis on the villains at the expense of the titular character - is even more justified by reference to this sequel.It must also be said that the tone - mixing very dark with the camp silliness of the TV series - doesn't quite work here. In particular, the March of the Penguins sequence is so ludicrous that it fritters away much of the liking I had for what had gone before.",Batman Returns

Burton takes even more of a morbid funhouse approach to this film than he did the first one, and it's extremely dark in a way that I like.The biggest problem is that neither the Penguin nor Catwoman is as compelling a villain as the Joker, and the two of them combined can't muster up the same level of energy and menace that Jack Nicholson's Joker created singlehandedly. Plus, I always thought Michelle Pfeiffer was miscast as Catwoman, though I liked the origin story they give her here.Still, the film looks fantastic, as all Tim Buron movies do.

But, incredibly enough, he is taken in by some penguins who live right there in the sewers and grows up into a repulsive creature known as ""the Penguin"" (Danny DeVito). And his first action is to kidnap the wealthiest man in Gotham City by the name of ""Max Shreck"" (Christopher Walken) and blackmail him into helping him rediscover his roots--or at least that's what he wants people to believe. But Max isn't the type who is easily controlled and instead attempts to manipulate him for his own evil schemes instead. At the same time Max Shreck's secretary ""Selena Kyle"" (Michelle Pfeiffer) happens to stumble upon a secret file that Max has which details an illegal scheme he is planning and she ends up being thrown out of a skyscraper to her apparent death. But she is somehow revived by some stray cats and having now gone totally insane decides to take her revenge upon Max as a costumed villainess called ""the Catwoman"". Needless to say, Gotham City isn't big enough for 3 such villains and it's up to ""Batman"" (Michael Keaton) to somehow save Gotham City from all of them. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that a dark and gloomy atmosphere is almost a prerequisite for a ""Batman movie"". However, this film probably went a bit too far in that department-and it got even more dark and gloomy the further on it went. Additionally, I didn't especially care for the rather bizarre ending either. Those issues aside, I thought all of the actors just mentioned performed credibly enough with Danny DeVito probably standing out the most in my opinion. Likewise, although I still believe Julie Newmar was the best actress to ever be cast as ""Catwoman"", I must admit that Michelle Pfeiffer wasn't too bad. But that's just my opinion. In any case, given all of the previously mentioned good and bad points I have rated this movie accordingly. Slightly above average.",Batman Returns

They develop a close relationship, since they both have a great deal in common...Danny DeVito portrays Oswald Cobblepot/the Penquin, who was a deformed child brought up in the sewers of Gotham, and now heads a criminal gang. DeVito effectively plays the pathos of this man, who can't decide if he wants to re-enter society or not, but a dramatic turn-of-events pushes him over the edge...Filled with fantastic action, set design, and music score, this production is another triumph, one of the few sequels to match the original, even though some feel it is too dark, the subject matter suits this.A great pity that star Michael Keaton and director Tim Burton stopped here, and didn't get the chance to do a trilogy, since the new team drove this series off the rails...A shame that.",Batman Returns

Devito is great as The Penguin, but he's too pantomime at times. Pfeiffer obviously steals every scene she's in with Keaton and Devito, nut again, she's way too over the top at times.But the film belongs to Walken, as the meglomaniac Schreck. He hams it up so much, The Sheriff Of Nottingham would be proud.Like all of the nineties Batman movies, plot plays second to spectacle, so we are treated to some really good set pieces, beautifully choreographed and filmed.Its pure Burton from beginning to end, and there wasn't a better Batman movie until Ledger became 'stranger'....",Batman Returns
32,Aaron1375,"Batman did return, but after this film Burton didn't.",6,27 October 2012,"This Batman film at the time of its release was thought of as a bit of a disappointment. Sure it did quite well at the box office, but really did not compare to the first one. The reviews were lukewarm at best, quite incendiary at their worst. I believe it had multiple razzie nominations and I do believe Danny DeVito actually won for worst performance. However, over the years for reasons unknown to me it has gained a following, now it is often said to be the best of the original four films. At one point it had a 6.2 score on IMDb, but now sports a 7.0. What changed? I have no clue as to me it is not the disappointment it was then, but I still thought the first film was better. Burton went darker with this one, at the same time in areas he went lighter. This one is a sequel, yet other than a throw away line about Viki Vale and a few of the same actors this film almost feels like a totally different film in some regards. Still, it is my second favorite film of the original four films, though it is a set of sequels that change up the formula so often that you hardly can tell they are connected when you compare Batman and Robin to the first film.The story has a strange circus gang on the attack, things get a bit out of hand and Commissioner Gordon calls on Batman. Did not take him all that long to become over reliant on the Bat now did it? Well during the chaos a strange person dubbed the Penguin makes his way out of sewer, part of his plan that is not really a Penguin plan of the comics. Meanwhile, Selina Kyle is having boss troubles to the point of being pushed out of windows and resurrected as Catwoman! The boss, Max Shreck, decides to use the Penguin for his own needs and makes a bold push to make this strange man into the mayor. Catwoman and the Penguin soon team up as the Bat keeps interfering with each and plan a caper to frame the Dark Knight.There is a lot going on in this film, and that is a bit of a problem. Penguin's and Catwoman's team up seems rushed, there are parts of the film that seem important that are never discussed again and the best villain is not even one of the two super villains, but rather Christopher Walken's Max Schreck character. Still, Burton has a way of making the very bulky bat suit not look like something that is going to restrict someone's movement to the point it is nonfunctional. The next two films it looks like the heroes can barely move! The suit on display in this film is also the best looking one of the original four ditching the molded muscles of the previous film and the strange tail on the bat insignia. The bat mobile still looks awesome, it doesn't for the next two movies and Catwoman's costume is hot...though I prefer the Lee Merriweather look in the 60's version as Michelle is too pale for my tastes.As for the villains, neither is really a lot like their comic book counterpart. However, Burton should not be restricted by a comic book nor any other director. Seriously, do people really want every comic book movie to start at issue 1? Granted, both get a very strange treatment as Catwoman gains her power from random cats, I would prefer she be just a cat burglar and Penguin's origin shown at the beginning would be great, if the villain was Killer Croc. He is also a bit to disgusting looking. I just do not see people rallying behind him as people are shallow and while they may not burn him at the stake, they are not going to fall in love with him as they do in this film. Michael Keaton is still good as Batman, I prefer Bale a bit over Keaton, but Keaton is miles ahead of the other two guys. I just think Bale did Bruce better while Keaton was actually better as Batman. With them it is close, not so much for Kilmer and Clooney.So I still do not see why people act as if this film is the best in the series including the Nolan films, however, I respect their opinion. One even gave me a list and while I did not agree it allowed me to understand a bit why they felt it was superior. To me, it was an okay film and a disappointing sequel. I just thought areas of it were to strange, some too lighthearted and it just did not continue the first film well enough (Billy Dee Williams...where are you?). It still had a lot of fun moments and it had a lot more Batman in it than the first film and probably the next two. Add a awesome action scene to the end and I would give it an 8, but the anticlimactic ending we got is one of the main reasons I did not like this film as much as the first and only give it a score of six. I still remember the disappointment I felt as a kid as the ending played out.",Batman Returns
33,The_Void,Superior comic book masterpiece,8,3 July 2005,"There has been a rush of comic book films lately that have garnered high praise, but what everyone seems to be forgetting is that, over a decade ago, Tim Burton made a film that is easily on par with the best comic book adaptations being made today; maybe even better. The film is, of course, Batman Returns; which can only be described as an all out comic book masterpiece. Quite frankly, everything that could be good about this film; is great. Tim Burton has succeeded on a number of levels to bring us the ultimate comic book movie - the characters, the plot, the atmosphere - everything in this film is right on cue. What really annoyed me about the first Batman film was that Burton didn't seem to know where he wanted the focus. It seemed as if he wanted it to be more on The Joker, but then he threw in some character building for Batman; and the final result was very messy. This has been sorted out for this film, and although it has once again left Batman in the shadows; Burton has given us two great villains to have fun with, and the fact that the focus is more on them only makes the film better.The plot mainly follows a young child that was dumped into the sewers at birth. This child would grow up to become 'The Penguin', and he chooses to rise from the sewers at around the same time that businessman Max Schrek has decided to throw his secretary, Selina Kyle out of the window; who then becomes her alter ego, Catwoman. The Penguin and Max Schrek then team up so that the former can get his revenge on Gotham City, and, of course, the caped crusader is on hand to dispatch the baddies. The plot isn't all that deep or intelligent, but it serves it's purpose and allows Tim Burton to do what he really wanted to do with the movie; create a very dark Gothic look for Gotham City! Batman's home town looks absolutely fabulous throughout this film, and the winter setting blends magnificently with Burton's Gothic architecture to create a world that excellently compliment's it's hero's dark personality, while creating a great aesthetic playground for Burton to weave his tale within.It's not just the atmosphere that makes this film what it is - a plethora of great performances have been added into the mix, with each performer giving great energy and enthusiasm to their roles. Michael Keaton returns to his role as the caped crusader, and pretty much does what he did in the last film. He's never really given a chance to impress, as his three villainous counterparts constantly upstage him. Danny DeVito is supremely grotesque in his role as The Penguin, and makes sure that he holds the focus in every scene he's in. This sort of role suits an actor like DeVito excellently, and this is the best I've ever seen him. On the flip side to The Penguin, we have Catwoman; who is played by the very sexy Michele Pfifer. She looks great in her black leather suit, and her demented portrayal as the tortured villain works brilliantly. Rounding off the cast is the magnificent Christopher Walken. Walken has an uncanny ability of making a huge impression in everything he's in, and his dark and downbeat portrayal as a shrewd businessman is just great.On the whole, I highly recommend this film to everyone. While the substance isn't always there, Burton has given this sequel enough style and enough entertainment value to more than adequately mask that fact and if you're a fan of cinema; I see no reason to dislike this film.",Batman Returns
34,zetes,Gross and dumb,5,22 August 2016,"I don't think I've seen this all the way through since it was in theaters when I was 13. I don't remember liking it much then, but I've long been thinking of re-watching it. It's developed a cult because of its excessive weirdness. It is that excessive weirdness that keeps it watchable. That, the awesome production design, Danny Elfman's score, and Christopher Walken. Without those elements, though, honestly, I don't know that this is all that much better than Batman & Robin (I'm not about to re-watch that one, but I did pick up Batman Forever on Blu Ray very cheap along with this - probably both will be a waste of money). If nothing else, it certainly plants a lot of the seeds that would grow into the monstrosity that was B&R. The script here is just awful, first and foremost. It's all just a mess, with all kinds of nutty crap thrown on the screen for little to no reason. It's terribly grotesque. Penguin isn't a rich man in a tuxedo, he's a mutant, and Catwoman is a zombie. It has a really dirty sexual streak. It gets really gross watching Danny DeVito perv all over everyone. It's chock full of terrible one-liners that sound awful even coming out of Michelle Pfeiffer. Batman is more or less forgotten for most of the film. Even when it's being aggressively weird, it's mostly boring. Walken really livens up the film whenever he appears - his murder of Selina Kyle is by far the highlight of the film. It's a shame he disappears for a long stretch in the second half. The first Burton Batman holds up pretty well. This one, not so much.",Batman Returns
35,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: Batman Returns,8,6 June 2005,"Batman Returns premiered 3 years after the first Batman, bringing back the Burton-Keaton team. The villains, although the spotlight is on both The Penguin and Catwoman, included a character created just for the sequel - Max Shreck, played by Christopher Walken, a corrupt mall chain owner bent on owning all of Gotham's electrical power.While the narrative managed to bring all 3 villains into the fold nicely, I felt that things could have been better if the focus was still kept on the main Bat villains. Since the villains again are the spotlight, I'll cover them first.Tim Burton's prints were everywhere in the creation of this version of the Penguin - a freak of nature, condemned to living in the sewers of Gotham while planning for his grand comeback to the real world, aided by Max Shreck. Again, the costume and makeup were until heavy wraps, and it was reported that Danny DeVito kept in character most of the time, hoping to beat his friend Jack Nicholson on the impact that this character could have on audiences. The Penguin's origin is one filled with, and ended in, tragedy. I remembered when this film came out, parents were up in arms against one of the scenes showing the Penguin spewing bile.Catwoman was changed too, as Frank Miller's Year One Selina Kyle was a hooker, which won't go down well with kids in audiences. Although some plot elements were not plausible, like Selina falling from a great height and brought to life by cats, the delivery was stylish, and Michelle Pfieffer oozed sensuality, vulnerability, yet tough as cookies, spunky attitude to Selina / Catwoman. The transformation scene with her making her own slinky costume and guzzling lots of milk was my favourite, and who could forget that kitty lick on the rooftop? Hot! (Not to mention that the costume was coming off and splitting along its seams as the movie progressed...) Credit to Burton though, while re-creating the villains origin, he kept iconic elements for each character intact, like the Top Hat, eye-glass, cigarette (on a holder), and gimmicky umbrellas for the Penguin, and Catwoman's whip and claws, although the narrative did not provide logical explanations on how she's trained on it (since she's a mousy secretary). Who cares though.Batman had a new costume with a proper logo. The look was sleeker, with chameleon-like abs. No qualms here though, as we know Batman has different costumes for separate occasions in the comics. Michael Keaton actually looked comfortable in the role. But still, the Batman killed. And that's a big no-no.With regards to the exploration of Bruce Wayne's love life, and falling for the villainess, this is my favourite amongst the 4 movies. Batman Returns had a strongest love story compared to the rest. The affections Bruce had for Selina even made him contemplate the notion (horrors!) of revealing his identity, and thoughts about giving up the mantle of the bat, just to be with her. (Ok, I know, in Batman Forever, he contemplated that too... more on that later) The theme of Duality took centerstage, as we saw all characters leading double lives, having to put on facades in the public, concealing their deepest darkest secrets and desires. The struggle with duality brought on a whole new meaning to the love lives of Bruce and Selina as well, and their revelation to each other on the dancefloor to the tune of Siouxee and the Banshees' Face to Face, and their reaction thereafter, was one of my favourite scenes in the movie.We began to see a glimmer of a strong partnership between Batman and Gordon in the film's beginning, but again, this was not exploited further. Given the plot, Gotham's Finest turned on the Batman, and it was fun to see him escape from the law.More toys were introduced (we still don't see where Batman gets his wonderful toys), and we saw the usage of the Bat-Glider (the stiffening of his cape), the good IL Batmobile being transformed into the Bat-missile, as well as the Bat-skiboat. The Penguin even had a mini-batmobile built, as well as a huge yellow Duck truck.Danny Elfman continued to score the movie, and brought in dark and separate themes for both The Penguin and Catwoman. The theme for Batman remained the same, though tweaked to highlight the movie's Christmassy setting. Only ""Face to Face"" made it into the soundtrack. No Prince or other artistes putting in music for this one.As a direct continuation from the first movie, we saw the use of the Bat-Signal. My gripe? Heck, Bruce Wayne is at home at night? He's the Batman, and on any night, he should be out there kicking the underworld's rear. He's proactive, obsessive, and obviously shouldn't have the Bat-Sginals mirrored in the rooftops of Wayne Manor.Batman Returns ended on a sad note, though with a flicker of hope that the Catwoman was still somewhere, somehow. Immediately after this movie, with Michelle Pfieffer's success in her role, word was out that a Catwoman spin-off might be in the works. Alas, what materialized was the disastrous Halle Berry effort.Many deemed this movie too dark, but in my opinion, this is one of the better Bat movies in terms of delivery, plot, and character motivation. It's unfortunate though, that this did not turn in expected returns at the box office.",Batman Returns
36,Mr-Fusion,"Macabre overload, if you can believe it",5,13 August 2012,"""Batman Returns"" tips the scales in the darkness department; which you would think is appropriate for a Batman movie and not something that would work against it. But every character herein is either born of tragedy or succumbs to it. This is Tim Burton's unchecked id taking over. That sometimes works, but in a movie jam-packed with villains, subplots and weird campy undercurrents, it doesn't offer a good flow.I don't hate this movie, but it's not very good. When Batman has something to do, the action's actually pretty fun. The Batmobile seems to roar onto the screen (even more so than last time) and there's a confidence that goes along with an anticipated sequel. But the performances from DeVito and Pfeiffer get lost in something that feels like cinematic depression.5/10Also, Christopher Walken steals the entire thing. That kinda surprised me.",Batman Returns
37,namashi_1,A Dark Masterpiece!,10,4 April 2009,"Tim Burton's 1992 blockbuster hit 'Batman Returns' is what I call a Dark Masterpiece. This film rocks!

With Batman Returns, it came pretty close! We have terrific actors and a great plot with the dark knight and two new villains, Catwoman and The Penguin. We have Michael Keaton back as Batman and he's still awesome than ever. Michelle Pfieffer, the perfect choice for Catwoman and was perfectly cast into place. As much as I love and is such an incredible actress Annette Benning, she couldn't have been Catwoman, she doesn't really have the look. Danny DeVito, who could have imagined him as The Penguin? He was just great and terrifying! Batman returns with a more loving community of Gotham City, they are celebrating Christmas time with, Max Shrek played by a creepy Christopher Walken. The perfect villain who mistreats his lovely secretary, Selina who happens to hear too much at his office causing him to push her out the window in hopes that she dies and will never reveal the information of knowing the Penguin and the attempt to make him loved in Gotham. When she survives and is awakened by cats, she wants revenge and is ready to go at it with her cats! But there is also another active villain, The Penguin who is in search of his parents that abandoned him and now he is looking to be the new mayor of Gotham City! Can Batman be able to stop both super villains from creating their hanous acts and stop the mayor from destroying the city as well?You'll have to see! Batman Returns is just as good as the original Batman, despite the first one remaining the true classic, this one still takes you for a ride. And come on, I mean we've got Michelle in leather!

39,blanbrn,Equally good and almost superior to Burton's 1989 original. And it's also dark and gloomy in it's own way.,9,12 July 2008,"1992's ""Batman Returns"" was Tim Burton's second round as director and yet again he scored a hit by making this film again dark and gloomy like his 1989 one. Gotham City again is a place of darkness and gloom with crime and corruption boiling out from every street corner. It was also clever to see how Burton used politics as a subplot that tied in well and neat with the business corruption of businessman Max Shreck(Christopher Walken)and the plan to make the ""Penguin""(Danny DeVito) mayor of Gotham! Anyway Keaton again returns as ""Batman""/Bruce Wayne and he gives another stellar performance as a strange and torn man who just can't find love in a normal world yet he is challenged when he meets another lonely soul in Selina Kyle only Ms. Kyle has a dark secret of her own one that's very slinky and she's just a downright vamp as the sexy and mysterious yet dangerous ""Catwoman""(Michelle Pfeiffer). A plan forms between both villains to destroy Gotham and most of all both want to rid themselves of the bat. Really this film even though violent and somewhat gross with many penguin scenes is clearly an exciting thrill ride from start to finish as you never find a dull moment and thumbs up to Tim again for his exploring of the characters as dark and conflicted it just made the film even more interesting. The performance from Michelle Pfeiffer was the best ever as no one could have played ""The Catwoman"" any better and Devito was perfect as the ""Penguin"" his body frame fit the character just perfect his performance even though ghoulish was fun to watch. ""Batman Returns"" is an entertaining thrill ride that you can't take your eyes off of as a viewer you will enjoy it many times it's that thrilling and explosive.",Batman Returns
40,MovieAddict2016,"Too over-the-top, but it has its moments.",5,3 August 2003,"There's a certain something about 'Batman Returns' that doesn't quite fit. Perhaps it's the mix of film noir with superhero-after all, isn't film noir the opposite of the notion of a superhero? Film noirs are about an Everyman in an odd situation, thrust into something he can't possibly stop; comic book superheroes are those who choose a life of salvation, who give something away voluntarily. Tim Burton's 'Batman' was a good comic book adaptation; one of the best. It blended film noir with action hero, super-hero-type stuff. Very risky, but it paid off. 'Batman Returns' fails miserably.The Dark Knight always was a bit darker than his other superhero friends, such as 'Superman' or 'Spider-Man.' If I had to choose a favorite, it would be Batman: The world he lives in is darker, and he is much more identifiable than someone who is extraordinary; Batman is just a guy tired of the bad life, much like Robert De Niro's Taxi Driver, who once said, 'Here is a man fed up with the crime on the streets.' Batman is, in a way, a sort of Taxi Driver.But director Tim Burton, whose other director outings have included the colossal hit 'Batman' and 'Edward Scissorhands' (both very dark films), fails to seamlessly blend film noir with superhero. The two are contrary, Batman living in a 1940s-era Gotham City always worked, but there's something wrong with this Gotham City. It was the start of more bad sequels, which would all lose the classy vision the original sustained. Things started getting darker and yet, at the same time, much brighter. Dialogue started getting cornier. Situations started getting ludicrous. 'Batman Returns' was the start of this; I keep repeating myself but I'm not sure how to explain what feeling this film gives me. In a way, I love Tim Burton as a director for the Batman series; in another way, I don't. In a way, I like the dark look of Gotham City; in another way, I think it's too dark. In a way, I loved the original; in a way, the sequels all suck.Batman (Michael Keaton), a.k.a. Bruce Wayne, is once again called out to stop the unstoppable Penguin (Danny DeVito), who is trying to take control of Gotham City with the help of Catwoman (Michelle Pfeiffer) and Christopher Walken (what's his character's name in the film? Who cares.)Many villains followed, many sequels followed, and they all stank. 'Batman Returns' makes the mistake of turning the Penguin, a very dark creature (from what I can tell as I never read the comics very much at all-barely ever, in fact), into an overly creepy, corny character who speaks a lot of clichés. He doesn't convince; Danny DeVito is the perfect casting choice, but his character is too weird to like, or even have fun watching. There's a certain joy in watching Jack Nicholson parade around as the Joker in the original 'Batman'-and though he was the bad guy, I myself kind of felt sad when he died at the end, knowing he would never be seen again (unlike the comics and television shows where he always appears to have died, only to come back again). Danny DeVito is great, but the things his character does, and the way he is captured on screen, is almost too dark to enjoy. This film is essentially much darker than the first, something I never imagined possible for a Batman film. Burton really pushed the envelope on this one.I must admit I have, on occasion, viewed the 'Batman' television show; not the 60s one (though I've seen that, too), but the cartoon show. It's splendid fun; it's a lot like Tim Burton's sequel but actually captures more of what the original film had. The villains, especially the Joker, are great fun to watch. I recommend the cartoon over this film, as Batman fans will find it much more respecting to the comic-strip, and regular moviegoers will actually find it a lot more fun to watch.'Batman Returns' tries a lot of things, but it doesn't get away with them like the first film did. How are we supposed to enjoy watching creepy villains that aren't any fun to watch? To be honest, I don't care. I gave up on trying to solve this after the third film, which though truly terrible, was even more fun to watch than this film (don't ask me why). The fourth was unbearable, but that's another story.2.5/5 stars -",Batman Returns

42,disdressed12,"equal to the original,except for one small problem",9,20 July 2007,"to me this sequel to ""Batman"" is as good as the first,except for one minor complaint.i'll get into that later.first,the good.this movie improves i think,on the fighting scenes.i think they were a bit more spectacular.i also think the suit looked a bit different,darker maybe,which i liked.Michael Keaton is good again as the the title character/Bruce Wayne.this movie, while generally staying dark like it's predecessor,occasionally takes on a more magical,almost whimsical tone,which is not a bad thing.this time there is more than one villain.first,there's Danny Devito as the Penguin,and Michelle Pfeiffer as Cat Woman.Devito is great as the Penguin,clearly relishing his turn as a psychopath.nothing wrong with that performance.but here is the one small complaint i have:the look of the Penguin itself.to me,it just seems like you could tell Devito had padding on to look fatter.this annoyed me a bit.Michelle Pfeiffer as Cat Woman is terrific,a dream to many males out there.she certainly looked good in that leather outfit.there is also a bit more chaos in this one,a few more explosions,but not so much that it becomes ridiculous.if it weren't for how not quite real the Penguin's bulk looked,this movie would rate as high as the first.however,instead of 10/10*,this film still gets a very strong 9/10 from me.",Batman Returns
43,KineticSeoul,Tim Burton's style really shines in this version of Batman,6,9 July 2012,"This sequel is more dark gritty and has more character development than the first one. The last one had some Tim Burton style going for it but this time it's really really distinct. Danny Elfman did a fine job of composing the Batman theme song and can easily get stuck with that tune in the audiences head. So when I think of Batman this theme song comes to mind since it just stands out. The previous movie shows the villain's origin and this one is no exception, except there are two this time. And it shows how certain character got to where they are. This movie might not tie in with the comics but Tim Burton's vision isn't too bad for this movie. Style and vibe of it is similar to the first one but it has a bit of dark Gothic feel to it. However some areas are just not developed enough to the point it can get sort of difficult to just go with it sometimes. When it comes to the penguins goons and some other stuff, it just seems a bit too far-fetched even for a Batman movie. It might work if it's a cartoon or goes in a really silly direction like the live action TV show. But that just isn't the case here. Also the characters actions and reactions are just not all that believable. Selina Kyle might not seem like a sophisticated cat burglar in this. And her origin might sorta suck in this. But she gives off this crazy and yet tenacious vibe. Michelle Pfieffer was a good choice for Catwoman, she isn't sophisticated like I said but she fits the role of a cat burglar for the most part and her voice is cute but acts crazy and rebellious when it comes to her action. She plays the role of a attractive and yet dangerous Catwoman really well. Well after she turns into Catwoman that is. Now the acting in this flick isn't necessarily good but the villains in this really get into there roles. Especially when it comes to Danny DeVito who played the Penguin in this, he was almost perfect for this role. Well at least for a Tim Burton version, despite him looking like a giant egg man sometimes. He may not be as intimidating as the Joker but he can be more comedical, intentional or not. Kinda felt bad for his character, but only slightly. Both villains are suppose to be a bit more sophisticated but these versions are passable although a bit too insane. Sometimes it feels like too much time is on the villains though than Batman. Which is probably one of the reason this sequel didn't do as well at box office. Cause youngsters go to superhero movies to watch the superhero. Commissioner Gordon is yet again wasted in this. When he plays crucial roles a lot in the comics. Lastly Christopher Walkens is always good and he plays a very very corrupt businessman There is few moments that make this movie stand out though, like the part where the Penguin and Catwoman taunts each other. This isn't necessarily a good vs. evil movie like the first one but has other elements crafted in, which might not be entirely a good thing but it works. This flick has it's flaws and not good as the first one although this has more character development. But it's still worth a watch, especially if you like Batman.6/10",Batman Returns
44,OllieSuave-007,"Batman returns, sort of.",7,14 June 2007,"This is the first sequel to ""Batman,"" and Michael Keaton's last outing as the Caped Crusader thus far. With this film, the mood is as eerie as the original film, this time starring Danny DeVito as the Penquin and Michelle Pfieffer as the Catwoman. Here, a corrupted businessman named Max Schreck (Christopher Walken) helps the Penquin to become the mayor of Gotham City; Max also wants to build a power plant that would steal Gotham's electricity. In the mix is Selina Kyle, who ultimately turns into Catwoman. The results lead to a dramatic performance by the tragic, yet frightful Penquin, and the sexy and luring Catwoman. Michael Keaton returns as Batman, and delivered a somber, yet powerful performance, just as he did in the first film. Keaton is, I think, the best of the three actors to play Batman in the first 4 films. The story is great, with plenty of action and great on-screen comprehension between Batman and Catwoman. She is an anti-hero of some sort, crafty and cunning, yet confused and apologetic. Out of all Batman's villains, Catwoman remains my favorite. Also, I enjoyed the music score by Danny Elfman - catchy, eerie and haunting. Some downsides are that some of the actions are a little overkill, like the part where one of the Penquin's goons attack the plaza during the Christmas tree lighting ceremony-a little too intense for a holiday scene. And, I think the movie should have focused more on Batman, since he does have the title-role and it would have been great to have his origins and background elaborated more. Batman just appeared on cue and didn't have a really intriguing introduction. And, Penquin took too much screen time; too much emphasis were placed on him.But overall, a pretty good sequel. Plenty of action! Grade B-",Batman Returns
45,thesar-2,Hell Here,5,5 August 2010,"Batman's a murderer. There's no getting around that. He literally killed someone. And Batmanjustdoesnotdothat.I'm revisiting some of my favorite 90s movies for a special series, and to be honest, I was thoroughly looking forward to this (unknown number)th viewing of Batman Returns. It's a real ""summer"" release, it contains Selina Kyle – an awesome Catwoman and the original and still best Batman – Michael Keaton along with the wonderful Tim Burton. So why would I only rate it 5/10 stars?Well, the story sucks. Really it does. Where the cinematography is awesome – PURE Burton – as is PURE Pfeiffer as Catwoman, the movie sags with the broken story. And it was the start of the original Batman franchise: More is more. Let's add more characters! That'll spruce it up. (Not really, but they thought so, all the way to Batman & Robin) Let's offer a suggestion: Pitch the Penguin (DeVito.) Keep but tone down Shreck (Walken.) And re-write the finale.Of the original four Batman movies, two directed by Tim Burton, two by Schumacher, this one is the one that's a direct sequel, whereas they flat-out mention events/characters from the previous installment. It's some time since the events where Joker (Nicholson) died in #1, and Batman's been waiting and now respected by (the now elusive) Commissioner Gordon (Hingle.) A new gang's in town, led by the Penguin who has an agenda.The Penguin's kinda, sorta controlled by Millionaire Max Screck who both wants to promote Penguin to Mayor and has a somewhat dead, but devious nonetheless, secretary Selina Kyle who becomes Catwoman when she falls to the felines around her and then she falls further for Batman and/or Bruce Wayne, who's struggling dual identities, still sinceMy head is spinning, and that's thanks to screenplay writer Daniel Waters. There's more and that's just too much. And that's, well, too much in a movie that could've been a contender. It's a beautifully shot film, despite being a cross between typical Burton and Rob Zombie's House of 1000 Corpses oddly enough.The movie starts off promising. It has that summer movie feel, regardless of the ""Christmas"" theme, in addition to a bloody fun Comic-Book movie feel, but surely sinks into over-plot'ness with too many angles. So many, that no wonder both Burton and Keaton refused part III. And it ends on such an outrageous finale, things that Batman would not surely do, that you wonder if they had an inkling of how to end the movie.And does everyone bypass the fact that Batman actually killed someone? Intentionally?! Spoiler alert or not, Batman attaches a bomb to a bad clown figure and pushes him down a shaft where he explodes. Not a thought goes into this scene, nor repercussions. Surely, Christopher Nolan would've explore Batman being hunted for murder.This all said, I still do rank it upwards to five out of 10 stars for the fantastic score – possibly the best score of all (so far) six movies, the best song – Face to Face by Siouxsie and the Banshees, the best baddie: Pfeiffer's Catwoman was simply delicious and one of her all-time best roles and the overall look of the sets and cinematography was superb.Despite all that's wrong with the picture, it's worth a shot for some good lines, Pfeiffer and Burton's vision. Get past the spotty story and the fact Batman would NEVER kill someone, and you have the only worthwhile sequel to the classic and original Batman.",Batman Returns
46,FeastMode,my notes,3,25 June 2019,"Pretty bad. better than the first one. Some interesting ways to pull off the action without special effects. so much dumb stuff and things you can make fun of. so many ridiculous parts that made me put my hands up in disbelief. horrible fight scenes. lots of bad acting, with the exception of Danny devito who did an awesome job as the penguin, and Michelle Pfeiffer as Catwoman.

SPOILERS
omg, so after Batman jams the frequency on the mind control devices attached to all the penguins (rofl rofl rofl), and makes the penguins go back to penguin lair, for some reason he pulls out the trigger that launches all the missiles, activates it, and subsequently loses it in a fight with the penguin who sets off all the missiles, causing random explosions throughout the last ten minutes of the movie. Also, they showed a shadow of cat woman after we thought she was dead, which would have been cool to let the audience decide if they thought she was still alive or not. But of course being a terrible old movie, they had to give the audience what they wanted and showed that she was still alive before the credits rolled. also, how did she become Catwoman? She was just a regular secretary who didn't know how to fight who was pushed off of a building and survived, but then all of a sudden she seem to have powers allowing her to die nine times and being able to fight with the likes of Batman",Batman Returns
47,lost-in-limbo,Masking a good time.,9,27 September 2009,"As a kid I grew up with the chintzy 60's TV series (and no I'm not that old POW!). However when director Tim Burton brought his novel vision to the silver screen, I simply took an immediate shine to it and never backed away from favoring his installments over the much hyped-latest additions ('Batman Begins' and 'The Dark Knight'), which I don't really care for. Even if they're going for a much more grounded approach and wanting to explore Bruce Wayne/Batman psyche further but in honesty I don't think there's all that much to tap in to. I wanted crazy fun with a dark streak and in my eyes that's what Burton brought across, and this is the reason why I can watch them over and over again. After wowing audiences with the 1989 'Batman', thanks to the gaudily Gothic art direction and Jack Nicholson take no-prisoners performance of the camped-up, but psychotic Joker. Burton would return 3 years later for the follow up and my favorite of the batman films so far; 'Batman Returns'. Camp, but well-done. In what would fair up to being even more expansive, louder, dreary, and nihilistic and having two villainous foes for the price of one. Enter the grotesque Penguin (with Danny DeVito magnificently going out on a limb) and the ravishing Catwoman (a steamy Michelle Pfeiffer who fills out the suit nicely) coming to spoil Gotham's party. Again Batman (an aptly brooding Michael Keaton is equally commendable and looks quite imposing in that bat suit look at the eyes) plays second fiddle to the bad guys, but I always preferred this sober interpretation of Batman that gave him an ominously gloomy mystique, but also a wearing psychological complexity that never felt the need to force feed. And his turn of Bruce Wayne was well served too. Burton's illustratively atmospheric direction opens with his sleek Gothic style engraving an carnival comic book world filtered in with a splendid range of characters and vivid costumes. The moody narrative (in what probably is a tad too long) is more so symbolic in its progression, rather show-piecing its spontaneously arresting and extravagant set-pieces and sharply etched art direction covered with shadowy tinges and grey/blue neon lighting of a wintry backdrop. The magnetically free-flowing camera-work takes flight and Danny Elfman's stately spacious score balances the playfulness along with gloomy touches with a very hypnotic pull. The rest of the performances might be overshadowed, but Christopher Walken digs in his teeth into a smarmily glassy role of a two-faced businessman Max Shreck. Pat Hingle is back, but gets very little to do as Commissioner James Gordon and Michael Gough is delightful as Alfred. In solid support are Michael Murphy, Andrew Bryniarski, Vincent Schiavelli, Doug Jones and Peter Rubens also makes a cameo appearance.",Batman Returns
48,Lejink,Neither fish nor...,5,15 February 2011,"I really enjoyed Tim Burton's first tip at Batman and felt he'd found a good actor for the lead, Michael Keaton as well of course as a highly individual and laudably retro- representation of the dark and monolithic Gotham City, making it almost a character in itself and thus easy to accept the grotesque and deranged characters which emerge from the gloom to take on the blacker-than-black hero. Here though, I felt that too much was not enough as we get two villains for the price of one, as The Penguin and Catwoman make their bows in Batman's rogues gallery meaning we get two origin stories, a changing shift of perspective and of course two big (or is that one?) deaths at the end. I can't fault the acting - as I said earlier, I like Keaton's calm demeanour as Bruce Wayne which turns to cold steel when he changes to his alter-ego, while Danny Devito, if never looking like my image of the comic-book Penguin and Michelle Pfeiffer (who certainly does) obviously have fun wearing the clothes and hamming it up in the dark. Christopher Walken also gets in on the act as an un-costumed mega-rich do-badder who casually throws a pre-feline Selina Kyle out of a high-storey building amongst many other sins.Overall though, I felt the narrative was over-cluttered and that a shorter film concentrating on just one enemy would have made for a less demanding watch. For all that the film's special effects are terrific, with lots of pyrotechnics to the fore while I also detected more humour on board to help lighten the journey somewhat. Burton is unquestionably a very talented director with an eye for a memorable image of which there are several here but this time I think he overcooked the feast. On his next outing both director and star were gone although the idea of paired villains wasn't but by then the element of realism was starting to crumble, to the detriment of the drama on the screen. It would take Christopher Nolan to go back to Burton's dark vision, obviously via Frank Miller to produce a Batman for the 21st Century.",Batman Returns
49,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,"Extroverted, eccentric but brilliant",9,29 June 2005,"STAR RATING: ***** Unmissable **** Very Good *** Okay ** You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead * Avoid At All Costs Welcome back to Gotham City, home of crime and home of the avenger of crime, the legendary Batman (Michael Keaton) a.k.a. millionaire playboy Bruce Wayne. While most of the crime emanates from muggers and thieves lurking in backstreet alleys and other grimy places, it's higher up the chain as well. Enter corrupt corporate boss Max Shreck (Christopher Walken), casually putting on a smile for the good people of Gotham whilst secretly running his own dirty little schemes, who's about to make an unexpected new ally. Abandoned by his rich, snobby parents from birth, tossed into the sewer and left to form into a hideously deformed man, The Penguin (Danny DeVito) has grand plans to endear himself to the people of Gotham, run for mayor and secretly fulfill his own hidden agenda to avenge his lot in life on the innocent people. And finally, Selina Kyle (Michelle Phyiffer) a dowdy, nerdy secretary for Shreck who becomes Catwoman, feline avenger of the night and the Penguin's sidekick. It's time for Batman to work his magic and save the city once again...Following the ultra-successful first Batman movie three years prior, a sequel was as inevitable as night following day. And in 1992, it arrived with Batman Returns, and with the same director, Tim Burton and with the same guy behind the mask, Michael Keaton. Given how much I enjoyed the first one, all of this should spell success. And, unlike in later years, where sequels with the same directors and such would start to suck, this was an earlier one that actually fulfilled.If you think of it all in this sense, you could look on it as a re-run of the first in a lot of respects, certainly the same formula, the same dark presentation and even the same running time! But it is, of course, a movie on it's own, with it's own qualities and high-points. It's not one of those 'sequel that's nowhere near as good as the original' types.So, where do we begin? Well, from the beginning. Opening to the sweeping, stirring soundtrack with the same clever camera angles that stylized the original. This is looking raring and set to be another distinctly comic book movie all the way. And it certainly gets stirred up in the eccentricity of it all as events roll on. Secondly, the performances. De Vito works his own unique brand of magic in the role of The Penguin, but he is ultimately side-shadowed by Walken, who manages a quietly menacing, delightfully devilish turn as the evil Shreck. Alledgedly, a vast number of publicity posters were stolen from Warner Brothers marketing department featuring Phyiffer in her Catwoman suit but (call me weird!) I only found her slightly more appealing than Halle Berry in Catwoman at a push. And then finally, there's the script. A delightfully hammy concoction of all the wildest comic book style extroversion you can imagine, combined with Burton's own unique style.Who cares if a bit too much time is focused on the villains and not on the development of Batman himself? Who cares if some of the action does look a bit rubbery (or maybe things have just moved on a bit too much for me?) Who cares if the ending, with the penguins with rocket-packs on their backs is eccentrically extroverted and even laugh-inducingly ridiculous in one sense? This is the ultimate comic book movie, and the last final, fleeting glimpse of Batman in his true, dark sense before the series deteriorated into the vacuous, colourful, chav-vy gloop it did. So three cheers for this, my favourite Batman movie. ****",Batman Returns
50,ElMaruecan82,Well done... but undone by too many villains...,6,30 July 2017,"""Batman Returns"" is by no means a bad movie. In terms of action, set-design, scoring and acting, there's nothing to envy from its predecessor of1989. Yet something was lacking, definitely. Whatever it was, I was so turned off that I'd rather explain why the original was so good instead.""Batman"" had that Gothic atmosphere that fitted the tormented mind of Bruce Wayne, billionaire, vigilante and misfit, and the noir tone of the film fitted a city where organized crime reigned supreme; but had it been just an exercise in style and design, ""Batman"" would've been poisoned by its own depressing mold, the film worked because it had an antidote, a grinning psychopath played by Jack Nicholson, a Joker who, as far as characterization went, was no joke.I said in the review of the first film that Nicholson's Joker scared me because of the way he enjoyed killing and made every homicide, an art, something fun actually. What it reveals about the performance doesn't need to be over-analyzed, you could tell Nicholson had fun playing the Joker, and that fun was communicative without making his actions any less impacting. The Joker, played by a deliberately over-the-top Nicholson was a histrionic bastard intoxicated by his own flamboyance and yet making the whole film a real macabre dance between organized crime and the Dark Knight.Keaton wasn't too present in the picture but his investigation on the Joker's action and the interludes with Kim Basinger were actually the moments we could catch our breath between two Joker's scenes. Now, to put it simply, Keaton isn't any more present in ""Batman Returns"", which makes the title a bit misleading, he's even a rather tertiary character, but the villains in the film could have made his absence unnoticeable except that they were as much in need of a psychotherapy as Bruce Wayne himself. The film got too psychological and dark for its own good.There is basically one villain too many, and I guess that is Max Shreck, Christopher Walken as the evil businessman who wants to control Gotham City through electric power. He doesn't have many shining moments, except for throwing his secretary Serena Kyle (Michelle Pfeiffer) out of the window once she unmasked her evil project, he does look good in an odd sexy way, but he's never as impacting a presence as Danny De Vito playing the Penguin or Pfeiffer as Catwoman, which is the height of irony since he's the actor most used to play creepy guys. You would think De Vito and Pfeiffer would spice up the film a little and ""have fun"" like good old Jack, but they're actually victim of the plot's intricacy.Indeed, ""Batman Returns"" feels more like an assemblage of many subplots that were certainly mouth-watering on the paper: Schrek's s plans, the penguin's quest to find his parents echoing Wayne's own trauma (he was abandoned an orphan child and was raised by penguins, living in the sewers for three decades), Serena Kyle seeking revenge against Shreck and criminals of male persuasion. There's also something interesting in the ambiguity governing the so-called villains, the Penguin wants to be loved by Gotham City community, Catwoman is a vigilante but her actions are often antagonistic to Batman, not to mention the romance growing in subtext.To make things even more complicated, you have Christmas in the backdrop, the City undergoes many assaults from the Red Circus Triangle, and many love or hate triangles from one character to another make the plot quickly derail. The original ""Batman"" had one villain, not the subtlest plot but that was enough, by trying to make many antagonists and make them as three-dimensional as possible, the film went in too many directions, creating a Rubik-cube of a plot, without the colors to make the final result look good.Indeed, each of these stories, was depressing as hell, there was something fun in Michelle Pfeiffer's Catwoman but like the Penguin, like Bruce Wayne, they were characters turned to the past, to the initial struggles of their human counterpart while the Joker was from any trauma. The only villain with a focus on the future was Schreck but he could only be underused, and so was Batman.In the end, you have a Christmas movie whose action sequence provided nothing new once you enjoyed the original but whose tone is so dark and depressing you might enjoy the film for the actors, the atmosphere, but you wouldn't think of watching it again.",Batman Returns
51,Pjtaylor-96-138044,Worse than the first solely due to the lack of Jack Nicholson's 'Joker.',5,19 March 2018,"'Batman Returns (1992)' is worse than its predecessor solely for its lack of Jack Nicholson's 'Joker', who was perhaps the only part of the first flick that provided any actual interest or entertainment. His presence is keenly missed as the replacement villain simply spews saliva and waxes lyrical about his penguin parentage and other misfortune, a weirdly wishy-washy waste of an iconic villain who's usually dapper exterior would've fit much better with the 'running for major' plot he's placed into here. It's also actually this film that starts to take the nose-dive into camp curiosity, something furthered exponentially by its neon-infused follow-up 'Batman Forever', as there are just too many oddly out-of-touch elements to cohesively gel with the originally Gothic yet relatively grounded take that this universe prided itself on, elements not just limited to the bile-brewing buzzard as you'd expect. The piece is still just as dull as before, but sadly also lacks the interesting punch of its clown prince of crime. 5/10",Batman Returns
52,richardchatten,A Whining Crybaby Rather Than a Sexy Lioness,5,5 August 2020,"Posterity has been bequeathed several classic movies - including 'The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp' and 'Vertigo' - that were transformed because the intended female lead became pregnant.You have only to see what Catwoman in 'Batman Returns' could have been had Warren Beaty not got Annette Bening pregnant from Bening's wicked little minx Myra in 'The Grifters'; far from the whining crybaby she became as played by Michelle Pfeiffer. (An interview with Bening at the time revealed that she had been about to dye her hair jet black for the part, which indicated an entirely different look had been on the cards at that point.)Pfeiffer brings startling blue eyes to the Felonious Feline; but although delightfully ditzy and vulnerable in her early scenes as Selina Kyle (like frazzled waitress Frankie from her previous film) she seems more like a little girl raiding her mother's makeup box when she actually becomes The Catwoman. (Cher - who was among those candidates initially mooted for the role - would have been no lady but certainly all woman.)And who on a zillion dollar super-production thought it a bright idea to give a supervillain an amateurish looking costume that looked as if it was covered in lobotomy scars? (Was she out of black thread?) She could have begun her criminal career by breaking into a sex shop and nicking a professionally-made catsuit in which she would have straight away looked the part...",Batman Returns
53,bowmanblue,The dark Dark Knight,10,29 May 2014,"Tim Burton's second Batman film has been largely regarded as the 'darkest' of all the Dark Knight's big screen outings. In fact, according to many, it was 'too dark' and, because of that, somehow less worthy than the other movies. Yes, the tone is pretty bleak, but, when you compare it to many of the films today (including Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogy) I can't really see the problem.Where some people see 'darkness,' I simply see realism. Yes, people get killed in 'Batman Returns' (shock, horror – even good people!). If that shocks and disturbs you so then you really should stick to watching Disney cartoons where everyone lives happily ever after.Besides, if you're contemplating watching Batman Returns then you've probably already seen Tim Burton's first Batman offering, i.e. 1989 smash hit with Jack Nicholson as The Joker. If you haven't, I'd start with that one first, as it sets the tone nicely for the sequel. Today's audiences may be more familiar with Heath Ledger's portrayal of the 'killer clown,' but, back in 1989, Jack Nicholson WAS the Joker. It was fair to say that he owned the role and whoever followed him in taking on the Dark Knight would have to be pretty damn evil to top him. Enter Danny DeVito and Michelle Pfeiffer. I don't care what Batman's modern day fans say... I still think Pfeiffer is a better 'Catwoman' than Anne Hathaway. Both of the new villains stepped up to the challenge and scared and slinked their way around the screen at all times.With two such great villains you could be mistaken for thinking that Batman himself might be a bit eclipsed (a common complaint about the first film). However, he too has upped his game (maybe Michael Keaton demanded more screen time and better lines after being so outshined by Jack Nicholson?). Either way, you'll be hard put to find anyone letting the side down.At nearly two hours, Batman Returns isn't a short film, but it seems to fly by. Maybe it's not a 'family friendly' movie and it certainly doesn't have the 'happy-go-lucky' feel of today's modern (Marvel?) superhero movies, but it is one of Burton's best 'twisted fairy tales' to date, so if you're in the mood for something nicely dark with a cracking Danny Elfman soundtrack, give this one a go and don't go thinking that Nolan's Batman was the ONLY Dark Knight out there.",Batman Returns
54,Cineanalyst,Gotham's Phantoms,8,15 December 2020,"""Batman Returns"" is a complete improvement upon Tim Burton's first ""Batman"" (1989). The production design is more vital and actually reflects the characters that inhabit it, and, in turn, their animalistic and dualistic natures seem to be determined by the spaces they occupy: Bruce Wayne of the mansion and Batman of the cave, Penguin in the sewer and mayoral candidate Oswald Cobblepot above the surface, Selina Kyle going from housecat to alley cat and from pussycat to one with claws based on her costume with its stitching aptly and prominently displayed--a more striking change than even that of Bruce and Bat. And to show this architecture off properly, there's some flowing camera movement this time and inspired framings beyond the occasional canted angle of the first film. Moreover, unlike the first film, the narrative here follows through on some of its allusions to other narratives, which underscore the above themes. Sure, some goofiness, as in the last one, is present, and Burton and company still seem to enjoy referencing other films merely for the sake of it (naming a character Max Schrek, after the actor from ""Nosferatu"" (1922), for instance), but for the most part, ""Batman Returns"" corrects every major problem I had with its predecessor.I'm a fan of the dark and perverse tone of it, too. There seems to be a tendency with blockbuster sequels, perhaps because studio executives become more invested, to soften the mood of the original, especially if it had any edge to it, for supposed mass, family-oriented appeal. It happened with ""Indian Jones and the Temple of Doom,"" and it happened with ""Ghostbusters II"" (1989) (and even more so with the reboot), to name two that come readily to mind. Apparently, someone selling ""Batman Returns"" had that notion in mind, which is why it was such a landmark in movie marketing synergy--complete with Batman toys in McDonald's Happy Meals. Fortunately, however, the making of the film and the marketing of it seems to have been relatively separated this time, as Burton and company decisively eschew any family-friendly Christmassy fast-food mush.Instead, ""Batman Returns"" accentuates the dark architecture and lighting of the original. Danny DeVito offers one of the most grotesque characters ever put in mainstream fare--the stuff of nightmares, truly. And Michelle Pfeiffer parades around in a latex catsuit--exuding sex the entire time, if not directly declaiming sexual innuendo none too subtly. Even Bruce repurposes a torture device, an iron maiden, to access the Batcave. Added to this, the Penguin's journey is a depraved variation on the biblical Moses: he's orphaned by floating down a river, only to come back with a promise of a plague to kill the firstborns.In the first ""Batman,"" there was quite a bit of Michael Keaton posing like Bela Lugosi's Dracula, but little else was done with that cinematic referencing. This time, the allusions are more consistent to another monster that originated on screen in Universal's classic horror movies. Like the Phantom of the Opera, the Penguin emerges from his subterranean lair to wreak havoc on the world above. Unlike the Phantom, however, the Penguin wears no mask to hide his hideous appearance; rather, Bruce and Selina wear them--except, ironically, at the masquerade ball. (By the way, in the novel, the Bal Masqué scene is the only one where the Phantom reveals his true face, as well, although the 1925 film features Lon Chaney wearing the guise of Red Death, which is briefly and obscurely referenced in ""Batman Returns."") And, if the Penguin most resembles Erik from Gaston Leroux's novel, then Bruce must be the aristocratic Raoul, who like Batman, usually fights against the Phantom and on the side of law enforcement as the two men compete for the affections of Christine--or, in this case, Selina.Indeed, Catwoman has the most compelling arc here, as her duality splits her between good and evil (and Pfeiffer stands out among the cast; this is the best role of her career). Essentially, she's a femme fatale, which is entirely more welcome than the damsel-in-distress love interest of Batsy last outing, as well as its concurrent useless subplot involving newspaper investigative reporting. ""Batman Returns,"" by contrast, excises such unnecessary narrative padding in favor of getting on with the action and in developing its themes, all of which coalesces much more congruently this time around. It's just three loons with spirit animals for their split personalities as they battle their phantoms in the opera of Gotham.",Batman Returns

Michael Keaton returns as Batman and this time he has to stop an evil penguin(played by Danny DeVito)from taking over Gotham City. Once again, the evil people or animals were just as sinister as the first movie. I thought that the suicidal penguins were a good idea, but that idea will not appeal to animal lovers. An all-star cast led by Keaton and DeVito were one of the best casts of the late 80's. Danny Elfman created another score with his usual, excellent feeling. The feeling of the film once again fills you with trill and excitement of what is going to happen. This is once again another Tim Burton spectacle. This movie is great to see!

57,lesleyharris30,"Much Darker but Sadly not as Fun as its Predecessor,",6,28 February 2015,"Batman Returns is a good movie with a well developed storyline and a terrific cast. It's still enjoyable, but it certainly lacks the same level of fun and action that we saw in the first Batman. Tim Burton is certainly a dark and unique director, but he toned down his weird style for Batman, this time around, however, he dosen't and it's much darker and creepier than you would want a Batman movie to be, for example, a scene of a woman being pushed out a window falling to her near fatal death and the Penguin biting someone's nose off. He clearly had more power with how the movie was made this time around, but he simply went too far with conveying his own style which dosen't really suit the Batman universe. The highlight of the movie is certainly Michelle Pfeiffer, she is a fabulous actress and performs brilliantly as Catwoman, her scenes are the most memorable as well, particularly her dialogue with Batman. My biggest problem with this movie is the same one I had with the first Batman, but it's more extreme this time around, Batman dosen't have enough screen time and is underdeveloped, the villain has much more dialogue, which wasn't a huge issue the first time around as Jack Nicholson was terrific as the Joker, but I really wasn't fond of Danny DeVito as the Penguin. Villiains normally have a lot of reasons to be likable, but the Penguin was simply creepy and every time he was on screen I was uncomfortable, it was clear that Burton found this character fascinating, but giving him, as well as Catwoman, more dialogue and screen time than the title character is simply odd. It certainly has its flaws and fans of the Batman franchise will probably be disappointed, but Batman Returns is still a very enjoyable movie and I would recommend it as a good action if you ever see it on television. Batman (Michael Keaton) must put a stop to a corrupt mayor and a psychopathic man who calls himself the Penguin, from taking complete control of Gotham.

58,secondtake,"The makings, if not quite the results, of a campy classic",7,15 December 2013,"Batman Returns (1992)I've seen this version of Batman a few times now, over the years, and in many ways it's the best of them all, along with the companion 1989 ""Batman."" And in some key ways, both of these fall just short of quite gelling into classics.Here's why, both ways.First, remembering Batman as a comic book hero, Tim Burton's version of that world is wonderfully exaggerated and fanciful and actually comic. This is the biggest difference (in my humble view) with the Nolan films of the last decade. Where Burton sees a chance to be inventive and playful, Nolan sees a chance to make the unbelievable real.It's a relief that there is no reality to Burton's world. Sometimes you can tell the movie was shot on a set—and the same set, rather a lot—but that's again part of the ""world"" we are drawn into.Characters for Burton are about excess just beyond camp. The Penguin is pretty amazing—Danny DeVito pulls it off like no one else could, an equal to Jack Nicholson's Joker from Burton's earlier Batman flick. And Catwoman as played by Michelle Pfeiffer is terrific. Batman himself might be a matter of taste—many people prefer Michael Keaton but I find him dull. And in this movie, he mostly stands around as Bruce Wayne and drives around as Batman. Not much physicality here.Christopher Walken? He starts off being weird and wonderful and then kind of keeps that steady state attitude throughout (even as his world is in constant tumult). It works, but it's not perfect. In fact that's what happens a lot of the time. Some of the ""action"" sequences aren't as elegantly edited (or shot) as other similar films (especially Nolan's) and so there is energy but not necessarily a visceral involvement. (You have to be thinking about this while watching it, I suppose.)But it's Burton's idea of Gotham, and his development of characters, that makes the movie really special. Whatever its limitations, it has so much that goes beyond expectations—and beyond the somber grandiosity of the Nolan versions—you really need to see it.",Batman Returns
59,Irishchatter,A very good Batman film....,10,3 September 2015,"I have to say,it was worth spending the two hours seeing this film then have watched the Dark Knight Rises not long ago. Seriously I think Michael Gough is the best Alfred of the 1990s like I really wished Michael Caine didn't appear as the present Alfred. Michael Hough is 10 times better and more of having a butler attitude like Caine! I honestly loved Michelle Pfeiffer as Catwoman, however she doesn't seem to have a good wardrobe when she's back to normal. Yes I know she was meant to be a goody two shoes nerd at the beginning but when she becomes Catwoman, she seriously needed a new wardrobe. She looked like she needed new clothes honestly. The only times she was beautiful, was at Penguins Ball and her costume. The fashion department probably needed Joan Rivers behind the set! It would've been better that way.Oh my gosh, Danny Devito was absolutely amazing at playing Penguin, although I wish his character didn't die in the the end. I wish there was a sequel for penguin so Danny could join again. It would be awesome.Michael Keaton was an alright Batman but Adam West is still on top of the list like. He seemed like a shy and quiet Batman really. We need a better superhero then that to be honest. He didn't show much enthusiasm or interest to make sure Gotham is safe from Penguin.

60,CuriosityKilledShawn,A Dark Christmas Knight,10,21 November 2000,"Batman Returns is a perfect film to watch during the holiday season as the winter/Christmas atmosphere that Burton creates for Gotham City is wonderful. It's weird that Warner decided to release this as a summer film. It doesn't fit.What's even weirder, when you consider the content of this film, is that it was aimed at families. An upper-class couple throws their mutant baby down the sewer, a socio-phobic billionaire dresses up in leather as a flying rodent, a lonely secretary has a mental breakdown and dresses up in leather as a feline, and said grown-up mutant baby freak runs for political office while being backed by a Trump-like business tycoon hungry for more power. Not to mention the S&M subtext that Tim Burton somehow managed to get away with. His eccentric visual style fits this film best, and is the height of his career, IMO. This is Tim Burton at his Tim Burtoniest.This is a true live-action incarnation of the comic-book character and Burton really should have stayed with the series to keep it on the correct course before it crashed and burned. Batman Returns is not as grown-up and straight-faced as the Dark Knight, but it's more atmospheric, and I just prefer the oddball character development here and Nolan's movies took themselves very, VERY seriously, almost to a fault. They are often depressing to watch while Burton's approach, and the animated series that it inspired, continues to resonate and find new fans.Darker and more violent than the first movie, the sense of Gothic pathos reaches a new high. I was quite keen on Michael Keaton as Bruce Wayne, he displayed the right balance of weirdo loner and cool crime fighter. Michelle Pfieffer is amazing as Catwoman (much sexier and more 'realistically' cat-like), she wears that leather outfit better than the embarrassment of Anne Hathaway, who was simply appalling. Danny DeVito is so convincing as the Penguin that his scenes become a little disturbing to watch. Special mention must be made of Christopher Walken, who is brilliant as the spooky Max Shreck if you think you recognize his Chip Shrek it's none other than Butterfinger from Hudson Hawk (fitting, as co-writer Daniel Waters is the man responsible for turning that movie from an adventure heist into an absurdist comedy).Sam Hamm returns to pen the screenplay, this time without being restricted (and sabotaged) by writers strike deadlines and it's a stronger film with a better assortment of characters, chemistry, and dialogue. He even manages to get in a subtle dig at the shortcomings of the rewritten 1989 screenplay by criticising Alfred for letting Vicki Vale into the Batcave - something Alfred would never do but was necessary for fixing structure problems.Danny Elfman's score is also even better than it was first time round. His powerful and engaging themes define the Batman universe better than any other composer. No offense to Hans Zimmer, who made some wonderful stuff for Nolan's movies, but Elfman gave Batman a sonic aura that became world renowned and it will always be THE defining Batman sound. This movie is the Batman phenomenon at its Zenith. Stick to the animated series and forget the following sequels. Christopher Nolan brought integrity back to the series, but before Schumacher destroyed it, Burton gave the original series integrity too and I miss this twisted fairy tale incarnation of the character.An essential Christmas film, and my favorite Batman adventure.",Batman Returns

As much as I love Nolan's Batman films such like 2008's Dark Knight for making more sense and realistic. I like how fun Batman Returns is. Yes, it's campy, creepy, and the plot makes little to no sense, still it's a lot of fun for me. Don't get me wrong, Nolan's films are superior movies over Tim Burton's mediocre films, but there is something about Batman Returns that get me watching all the time when it's on, TV. I think it's because it's feels like a creepy comic book movie. For me, this isn't supposed to be remotely realistic, this is a straight up fantasy. It has that old school horror movie feel to it. I love the Danny Elfman score, the cinematography, the set design, the ghoulish and semi-camp German Expressionism tone. I can see why it was too frightening for children to the point that parents got rid of the Batman Returns Happy Meals and didn't allow the kids to watch it. There were serious WTF moments in the film that pretty damn dark like Penguin (Danny Devito) eating a man's nose, a baby being abandon, sexually depraved dialogues between the Penguin and Catwoman (Michelle Pfeiffer) and countless deaths. But seriously did any of these children ever see The Dark Knight? I have to say that, pretty scary and violence as well. Honestly, it's the parent's choice to allow their kids to watch it or not. Thank God, my parents allow me to see it because it's the film that made me a fan of Batman. This movie is messy, nonsensical and heavily flawed and I still love it. The movie starts out Penguin being abandoned by his parents because of his physical deformities when a child, he then tries to rejoin humanity with the help of a businessmen Max Shreck (Christopher Walken), who then uses him as a part of his plot to allow his business to continue to operate free from government oversight by asking him to become mayor after the city start to sympathize him for what his parents did to him. What the film does wrong, is make him a villain outright without much character development. Rather than getting abused and tossed aside just at the moment when he almost begins to believe that perhaps he is capable of being respected and that people may not be so bad, the film makes him deranged, terrorist and the monstrous psychopath bear little resemblance to the savvy, anti-heroic thief or the neutral informant businessman of the comics. If only they had the betrayal by the city folks drives him insane and he tries to destroy the society that spurned and abused him would make an excellent movie rather than Penguin looking like a monster dimwit with his multiplies fails plots like getting revenge on Gotham socialites by abducting and killing their infant or blowing the city with penguin carrying missiles. As much as I like Christopher Walken and his President Andrew Jackson's hairdo, the story could have done without his character. I know Shreck is the bad-guy of the film that needed to put Selena on her quest for revenge and track towards insanity. You can easier fit Penguin in that role. The best part of the film is the conflict & romance of Selena and Bruce that should had been the main focal point of the film. Bruce Wayne (Michael Keaton) and Selina Kyle. Pfeiffer and Keaton both give great performances, and their on-screen chemistry is excellent. If the main focus had been on developing their relationship it would have been a great movie. As it is, just a handful of short scenes together simply didn't cut it. The sequence with Bruce and Selena at the party was the best scene in the film. The conflict and chemistry between the two draws you in, especially when watching Selena's own problems with mounting insanity. Still, don't know how she became a master of kung-fu. I love Michelle's catwoman more than Anna Hatchaway in 2012's Dark Knight's Rises. As much as I love Michelle, Anne Hathaway comes the closest to portraying Catwoman from the comics as far as the movies goes. Still, Michael Keaton was the best Batman. The mischaracterizations of Batman from the first film are carried over and amplified here. Batman is murderous, and remorseless. True, Batman originally carried a gun and killed, but that aspect of the character didn't survive the first year of an 80+ year run, and is not really a valid interpretation of the character anymore. Batman doesn't murder people. Thank God, Marlon Wayans wasn't portraying Robin and Robin was cut out. The inconsistent tone of the film also works against it. Burton presents a very bleak, grim, nihilistic serious story, where the good guys aren't that good and the bad guys are monsters. He them loads the film with absurdist camp set pieces, but plays them straight and seems to expect the audience to take them seriously. This causes the tone to shift wildly, and the audience ends up laughing at things meant to be taken seriously and taking jokes at face value. Artistic license is one thing, but these characters got the worst of the Burton treatment, and both characters suffer for it in a major way. Overall: I agree Batman Returns had flaws. Batman Return has a somber tone punctuated with ridiculousness, but it's watchable. I can't say the same with its follow ups: 1995's Batman Forever and 1997's Batman & Robin. Those movies nearly ruin batman until Nolan step in with 2005's Batman Begins. Still, glad Tim Burton didn't made another Batman after this.",Batman Returns
65,The-Sarkologist,A lot better than the first Tim Burton Batman film,6,14 October 2011,"In my opinion this movie romps all over the first Batman. Tim Burton isn't really an action director but the action scenes do not subtract from the overall impact of this movie. Batman Returns as set the standard for the next two Batman movies, though after Tim Burton handed the reigns over to Joel Shumacher Batman has become more comic book like and is slowly reverting back to the original television series. The critics did not like this movie and the reason that they give is that it is not like the original comic books. It is too dark and the characters are not heroic as a comic book hero should, but they are more like the anti-heroes of the late forties, early fifties movies. Batman Returns is considered to be Film Noir, or Black Film, though a friend says that it goes far more Gothic than Film Noir. He also comments that these Tim Burton Batman movies are much closer to the original comic books where Batman is truly a pained individual and suffers from childhood torments. In effect the critics found Batman Returns far too depressing for their tastes. That is why I liked it. I really enjoy Tim Burton movies because they are close to my style of filmmaking and writing. I tend to create characters who are either pained or tragic and spend the movie either destroying themselves or trying to live with the pain. This is what happens in Batman Returns. The three main characters live lives of pain: the Penguin (Danny DiVito) was thrown into the sewers by his parents when he was a baby because they could not live with a freak, the Catwoman (Michelle Phieffer) lives a double life as a secretary who struggles to survive in an unloving, unforgiving world, and Batman also lives a double life as a lonely millionaire who has not got over the death of his parents. The Catwoman and Batman are very similar and as such their respective characters are drawn together. They both live double lives and Burton does well to drop hints of this double nature. On one hand when they are in their masks, they fight for that is their nature: the Catwoman is a villain and Batman is a hero. When they are out of their masks they are lovers for they can see that there is something unique about each other. The pain comes when they know that they must then don their masks and fight. Batman Returns is not a film where the good guy gets the woman in the end because their is a rift between the characters that they cannot cross, and they know it. They love each other yet they know that they cannot. Batman Returns, like Batman, is visually spectacular, but with Batman a bad story and characterisation destroyed that. Batman Returns comes back with a brilliant heart wrenching story that the critics in Hollywood cannot understand. Tim Burton tends not to make films that appeal to the masses at Hollywood and one of the reasons is because the dream world that people love to live in is rudely torn open. Here in Batman Returns, the dream world is ripped open with the realisation that the hero cannot always have the girl. He couldn't relate to Vicky Vale, and this is brought out here, and he cannot have Catwoman, because she is a villain and the hero must defeat the villain. Burton has created a brilliant dilemma here and this dilemma makes American heads hurt.",Batman Returns

68,Movie Nuttball,Batman Returns!!!,10,18 May 2002,Minor SpoilersFor three years Batman fans were waiting for a sequel and this is it! It has the Penguin and Catwoman which are brought to the big screen greatly! Michael Keaton reprises his role for the second times as Batman sadly the last time of the four films. His peformance is just as good as before. Danny DeVito performs good as the Penguin and Michelle Pfeiffer is excellent as Catwoman. She is so neat just not as Catwoman but as Selina Kyle aswell. She is such a great woman! The film starts off with a bang and battle scenes between the circus and Batman is just excellent! I just loved it when they came out of the giant Christmas present and terrorized everyone!I recommend all Batman and action movie fans that hasn`t seen Batman Returns to this soon!,Batman Returns
69,redryan64,In BATMAN RETURNS We See Why Michael Keaton Split!,7,21 June 2007,"Once again, we have a case of taking some liberties with an established comic character. Where we understand the need to adapt certain material from one medium to another, we must protest when a writer/director monkeys a little too much.In BATMAN RETURNS,the second of the Batman Big Screen Box Office Bonanzas, we have what seems to be a formula.Following 1989's BATMAN, which featured the Origin, even the Christening* of The Joker. For the most part, the story was well handled.(Read my Review of the 1st Tim Burton BATMAN(1989) ).Starting with #2 Film, BATMAN RETURNS, we seem to have some doubts about sustaining a full 2+ hours with just one measly Arch Villain to do battle with. So, a sort of split time screenplay with 2 separate(but equal) sub-plots; almost like having 2 different movies.As to the Selina Kyle Catwoman episode, we can give it a reluctant o.k., or at least an ""o"". Mr. Burton took the Feminine Feline Angle, and ran with it. From a female enemy, who had been a Second Story Woman** and a Gotham City Socialite, to a Career Girl with an almost Lycanthropic*** relationship to her cats. Interesting, we haven't seen her return, yet.As to the Burton treatment of The Penguin, well that's another story. In looking back into Comics' History, we find that the Penguin made his First Appearance in the lead Batman Story, ""One of the most Perfect Frame-ups!"", Detective Comics #58, dated December, 1941. The story was penned by Bill Finger, long time Batman scripter and the writer responsible for so many of the Batman items , of which we all have come to be accustomed.In the story, Mr. Bruce Wayne and his Ward,Dick Grayson observe a very unusual looking, little man at an Art Gallery. They make the observation, ""...Doesn't he look like a Penguin?"" As the story progresses, we learn that the 'funny looking' little guy is up to no good. He is a criminal, of the caliber requiring the attention of The Dynamic Duo.At an early part of the story we hear the true name of The Penguin spoken. It's Mr. Boniface. That's his name, Mr. Boniface. (Remember this, it might be on the Test!) But just a name change alone is a bad enough transgression. But, the movies Origin and Characterization are hardly palatable.The Tim Burton remake the Penguin a Totasl Freak of Nature, not only abandoned by his Parents (played by Mr. and Mrs. Peewee Herman), but thrown into a sewer after a life in which his deformities were hidden from the world. Flipper Feet, Wing-like Arms, an Elongated and Beak-like Probosis, Beedy Eyes and Larry Fine-like Hair. Add that raspy, dry, gravely voice that Danny DiVito uses and you have a study in the Grotesque, a Classic example, no less.The Penguin of the Comics and of the Batman TV Series (1966-68)was odd, peculiar but not gross as Director Burton re-made him. I don't think he was such a Hommicidal Maniac, either.If the Penguin was any thing with his short stature, his waddling walk and his ever present Tuxedo and Top Hat, along with his wearing of a monocle, he was Eccentric.In looking around for just what was the inspiration for Batman cartoonist, Bob Kane and chief script writer Bill Finger in creating the Penguin, we have a theory. Just watch John Huston's THE MALTESE FALCON (1941), Starring Humohrey Bogart. Just take a look at the portrayal of Villain, Kasper Guttman by Sydney Greenstreet. His looks, his costuming (right down to gloves and spats),his slow waddling gait,the rolly-polly build all lead one to conclude that he was the inspiration for the Penguin. Certainly not this grotesque, twisted sewer dwelling monster.* In giving the gangster who would become The Joker the name of Jack Napier, Mr. Burton did us all a favor. Now correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't believe he ever had any other name. THANX, Tim.** Burglar have been called Second Story Men for years, so in keeping with Political Correctness, we offer this Gender change.*** From Lycanthropy or belief in certain men's ability or curse of changing into Wolves. See also Werewolf.",Batman Returns
70,Dr_Coulardeau,Never bring a cat in front of a bat,9,2 October 2015,"Thirty three years later Batman is still the same age and Alfred Pennyworth has not caught one single wrinkle more. They are beyond time. That's of course the very first axiom of a comic strip, hence of any comic strip super hero (look at Tintin for one). They do not age. Around them though people are getting old of course, but since very few are the same from one film to the next it does not matter. And of course Batman's paramour of the first film has disappeared from the picture, or should I say pictures?Then the plot has to be really renewed indeed. Tim Burton has decided to make it a lot more complex and complicated. Instead of one good one, Batman, and one bad one, here the Penguin, he gets two more, both on the evil side, though one is slightly insecure as for her profile between good and evil. Catwoman is a funny addition here because she is a super hero who is supposed to enhance Batman more than achieve anything. She is a simple secretary that her boss decides one day to kill by pushing her through a window. But she survives. There are miracles like that in life. And she becomes Catwoman out of her total insanity. Her only objective is to be a nuisance but on any side available though at the last minute she rejects Batman because it might be too confusing since Batman proposes to get into a love affair but under his real identity of Bruce Wayne. True enough a cat and a bat together in the same bed does not sound serious.The second addition, and frankly only evil, is the industrialist Shreck who wants to build a power station that would produce a lot more than necessary. But the real problem his secretary, the future Catwoman, discovered is that the factory will be an environmental and ecological catastrophe (3that will be my legacy"" says Mr. Shreck, showing how vain industrialists can and may be.). The film is very skimpy on this problem and Bruce Wayne, at the end, only tells him to stop speaking because anyway he is going to prison as soon as the film is finished.The main character against Batman is the Penguin, a melodramatic orphan (self orphaned probably), a pathetic story teller, a miserable violent and criminal ambitious nincompoop, a lackluster entertainer who is just the addition of poop to nin, nothing, though it means ""not of sound mind"" in Latin. He lives with a whole flock of penguins in an Arctic kingdom of some sort in the sewers and he is surrounded by a band of social cases who are jugglers, acrobats, whizz kids, and plain clowns and criminals who are just there to entertain the crowd before shooting them down like useless dogs. Though it is a cliché to say that a social case or a serial killer is the result of the bad education given to a child by his parents, it is done effectively to make us believe that the poor chap has become a criminal by choice vastly teleguided by what society made him suffer, bear and endure, in this case because he has a certain physical malformation that becomes his total fixation. His orientation and fixation then is a bird that does not fly and eats salmon. I guess that would easily be considered by some as the eleventh gender orientation, because as for gender he is nothing but a bird of no feather at all.The action is packed, the violence is brutal, which is expected, and the end is sadly unromantic, which is saluted by the audience as a good thing because if a cat meets a bat I do not know what kind of a chat they could have under their hats, and one cannot pat the other but scratch and when the other sat on the first one she felt like a rebellious mat. And imagine a rat in that couple. The two would be fighting to have a good bite into it. An entertaining film with some obnoxious situations for obnoxious people, like the mayor of Gotham, or Mr. Shreck. You should get some kicks out of these human animal hybrids.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU",Batman Returns
71,zkonedog,"Solidly Entertaining, If A Notch Below The Original",8,12 March 2017,"After Tim Burton's 1989 Batman effort proved to be one of the biggest superhero films of all-time, the director wrestled more editorial/creative control away from the Warner Bros. studio heads. What results is a sequel effort that is closest to Burton's unique (i.e. odd) vision of film-making, but still works due to some iconic imagery and acting performances.For a basic overview, ""Batman Returns"" sees two new villains introduced to Gotham City: the mysterious sewer-dwelling Penguin (Danny DeVito) who seemingly just wants to find his long-lost parents (but also may have more nefarious goals in mind) and the frazzled secretary Selena Kyle (Michelle Pfieffer), who is harangued by her boss to the point of mental breakdown and the creation of Catwoman. The villains form an uneasy truce due to a common ""enemy"" in the way of their plans: Batman (Michael Keaton). Concurrent with the superhero business, Gotham mega-mogul Max Schreck (Christopher Walken) hatches a nuclear power plant scheme that involves the super-trio in various ways. Further complicating matters? Bruce's romantic entanglement with Selena.Despite featuring the same director (Burton), this film feels very different from its predecessor. Whereas that movie was very much grounded in reality (Nicholson's Joker is basically a mob boss, the death of Bruce Wayne's parents is central to the plot, etc.), this one is much more of a gothic fantasy. Penguin is a literal monster, Catwoman is deliciously over-the-top, and even Batman gets more wise-cracks in than usual. It's almost as if Burton figures the character-building material is over and thus pushes straight ahead into fantasy.Another aspect of ""Batman Returns"" which also strikes me as odd is how many aesthetic changes (and mostly for the worst, I would argue) are made from the '89 original to this one. Wayne Manor and the Batcave are completely different, the Batsuit and Batmobile also see slight design changes, and the overall tone is just a lot less serious (much more tongue-in-cheek type humor). I don't know why Burton or WB felt compelled to change around so many elements that made the first one so iconic.Fortunately, the film is able to overcome nearly all of these weaknesses due in large part to its iconic villain performances. DeVito's Penguin is genuinely creepy, and all in all largely too spooky for any children who may be watching (a big part of the reason why the franchise went in the flashy Schumacher direction after this). I'm not sure a better representation of a freakish Penguin could ever be created. Pfieffer, while a bit hurt by the odd Kyle character, also portrays Catwoman adeptly. The stitch-based Catsuit is iconic for its visual and sexual aesthetics, and Pfieffer's exuberance both serious and comic is hilariously fun to watch.Also a strong suit of this film is the cinematography. Despite being filmed almost entirely on the WB lot, some of the shots set up some truly remarkable visuals. I'm thinking here of Peguin's lair at the Gotham Zoo and Selena's apartment. In this case, the shift from gritty reality to fantasy may have actually helped, as it allowed for a wilder visual style that really worked here.Overall, ""Batman Returns"" is a solid sequel to the blockbuster original. It often gets a bad rap due to its darker tone/feel, but considering the two vastly inferior films that succeeded it I'll take ""dark"" any day of the week. The only reason I give it a slight star reduction (9 to 8) from '89 is because of what I can only term a bit too much of ""Burton strangeness"". Despite feeling constrained by the studio in making the first one, that reigning-in might have actually helped Burton come to a more coherent product. Here, Burton is free-wheeling in his vision all the way through. More of it ""hits"" than ""misses"", but it still isn't quite to the bar the franchise had previously set.",Batman Returns
72,poe426,The Christopher Walken show...,10,8 November 2014,"BATMAN RETURNS has the distinction of featuring more memorable villains than any other comic book-based feature film. We have Michelle Pfeiffer as Catwoman (in a role that would've been better served by Sean Young, if you ask me) and Danny DeVito as the mutant Penguin- but it's Christopher Walken as Max Shreck who steals the show: his delivery is the reason. When he catches secretary Selina Kyle going through his files looking for evidence of corruption, he asks her: ""And how exactly did you access confidential files..."" And here his voice drops to a mere whisper as he concludes: ""...May I ask...?"" In a movie chock full of what were probably meant to be witty quips (there's very little real dialogue in the film, but that's okay, it's implied: this is only a ""comic book movie""), Walken's handling of almost throwaway lines is masterful. Catwoman's costume is sexy, to be sure, and the Penguin is one of the most horrific creatures to ever waddle through a comic book cum movie, but it's Walken as Shreck who really stands out. (Oh, and Michael Keaton is still great as Batman.)",Batman Returns
73,johnnyboyz,"Simply, a wonderful blending of evil clashing with evil clashing with would-be 'just' to produce an interesting character piece on top of a high octane ride.",8,12 February 2010,"In Burton's revisiting of the Batman franchise following his 1989 escapades, he delivers a film better than the first, in that it is more mature and spreads out to accommodate the progressions of its three predominant characters. In being given more to do, Burton essentially produces a film that is of a higher quality; doubly able to deliver on fronts of character as well as pay close enough attention to the power struggle going on within the place its set, as corrupt business'; faux politicians and sociopathic civilian inhabitants of Gotham City seem to vie with one another under the careful watch of the film's lonely, somewhat socially inept, billionaire protagonist Bruce Wayne, alá Batman.The film will see a variety of characters, three of which are bound in not only their power struggle but also by way of having their names linked to the animal kingdom, interact and form respective bonds as the future of a bustling city hangs in the balance. Two of the film's four central characters are monsters, one a slick and handsome business tycoon named Max Shreck (Walken) with the other a foul, thrice-decade sewer inhabitant named The Penguin (De Vito). This, as the two that complete the quartet struggle with their own issues of violent mask and costume-clad alter-egos which clash with quiet, lonesome and restrained 'by day' personas in Michael Keaton's Bruce Wayne/Batman and Michelle Pfeiffer's Selina Kyle/Catwoman.The film begins with a grandeur and quiet frightening opening, that of a disfigured baby being born and consequently disposed of by the parents, a nasty sequence in which they head out into Gotham City park in the dead of night avoiding contact with other parents of newborns and tossing the kid over a bridge into a canal. As we watch it float down the various waterways which lead to the sewers, the camera lingers on this baby's cot as we observe it through long pipes and steel barred drain entrances as it drifts, seemingly harmlessly, down the rivers of the city and into the sewers. We are given time to ponder to ourselves what foul, household cat eating beast lies inside. When get a first glimpse of the creature in its adult years, it is by way of an expressionistic shadow, furthering a sense of the uncanny.Indeed, many years later Max Shreck sits in a conference room delivering a talk to some of his business cohorts. His business, simply entitled 'Shreck's', has its HQ based in a high-rise building amidst the others, looming ominously over Gotham; his company's logo on the very top, spinning around and around insinuating the power in the numerous directions the company has in the holding of its power over the city. This, as models of the same logo lie strewn around other Shreck infused buildings. The logo is of a smiling animal, but there is a degree of unsettlement in its features, most certainly echoing what the owner of the organisation is like and has in store for those that dwell in the city – like Shreck, it is a face that seems to mean well but whose true intentions are much more sinister.Working for him is Selina Kyle, an individual who makes it very obvious she lucks out on men and life in general. Upon being present during Shreck's talk, she attempts to join in with the suit-clad, ego driven businessmen in making a suggestion but is promptly put back in her place with a cruel put-down from Shreck plus a statement which enforces her domesticisation, despite her shortcomings, in that she makes ""a Hell of a cup of coffee"". Kyle maintains a seemingly odd relationship with her mother by way of the messages she leaves on her answering machine, while the numerous stuffed animals and child's toys scattered around her room maintain the odd aura. When a chance event leads her back to Shreck's office, she accidentally dominates her surroundings by way of ingenuity in cracking Shreck's password to some top secret files; files that reveal acts of a criminal nature – the consequent punishment for this act of attempting to 'become big' within the office environment is death, instigated by Shreck. Essentially, an event that tips her over the edge and by way of some alley cats; the uncanny rejecting of her previous image as well as a little black magic; becomes the powerful and somewhat man hating creature of Catwoman.The Penguin, in setting up a false rescue of the mayor's child, ascends to the surface with Shreck as his companion when a blackmail plan arises. What you flush, Penguin flaunts – an idea of things coming back to haunt you when you don't rid your life of them correctly. Despite having this pointed out to him, Shreck makes a similar mistake by only assuming Kyle to be dead when he attempts to kill her, only for her to return and cause chaos. Penguin embarks on a mayoral campaign after winning over the city as this myth becomes reality, but while everyone is fooled, Wayne isn't and there's a superb scene in which Penguin goads Batman for having a direct approach in conversation despite hiding beneath a mask – there's a moment of realisation when Batman makes it known he's guessed what Penguin's up to, and that he too has a mask on in the sense he isn't the person he says he is, despite, again, the direct approach in reaching out to all the inhabitants of the city. The film's blending of character with a distinct sense of dread as these power-mad people threaten to consume an already bleak looking world actually comes across as quite interesting as certain images of a disturbing nature and individual scenes of menace keep it grounded from reaching too far out to children. The film is to date, of all the contemporary Batman films, my favourite.",Batman Returns
74,filipemanuelneto,Tim Burton's disaster,2,26 March 2016,"This film is a sequel to the movie ""Batman"" by Tim Burton. And as the first film, falls into the same sins: lack of realism (not even try it) and excessive attachment to the comic strip that gives rise to the central character. Blame it again Tim Burton, which shows little understanding of the comic-book universe and how capable he is of direct cinematic masterpieces or disasters. The film has the participation of Michael Keaton (as Batman), Danny DeVito (as Penguin) and Michelle Pfeiffer (as Catwoman), and only DeVito could shine, incorporating a spiteful and callous Penguin, still unrivaled in cinema.Moreover, the notes I've made for the first film applies perfectly to this also: the cinematography is so black that looks like it's always night in Gotham City, a city that, thanks to the unrealistic scenario, seems a depressed and bloodthirsty version of Orwell's Metropolis. The costumes seem's Carnival masks: Batman exaggerate in plastic polymers and Catwoman would be absolutely perfect in a hardcore and decadent version of ""Fifty Shades of Grey""...

But if you read the comics, the batman of 1939 isn't the same than the one of 1989 or more accurately, frank miller's ""DK"" is far away from his ""DK2"".Maybe the choice for Xmas period isn't very adapted to superheroes because here, the feel is a bit cold and doesn't help a rather boring script: Batman is again sidelined and a bit stiff glued in action. funnily, the two movies taken together, Bruce appears a bit like a pervert and not because he dresses like a bat at night. In fact, each time, all he is doing is seduce a woman, get her in his bed and feel compelled to reveal his secret identity. The villains gets an inflation (three instead of one) but Schreck and Penguin are irritating. That's left Catwoman who is truly the best thing here. Pfeiffer did an amazing job, getting totally in that crazy part. She reveals a wonderful ethic for her craft and a very sexy side of her personality.The sets and visual are beautiful and Danny's score matches and maybe is better than his previous one.Finally, my feelings is a bit mixed but this Catwoman and her haunting presence wins me over.

Despite its chilly Christmas setting, the film was released in the middle of a very hot summer. I was spending some time in Arizona, and going into an air-conditioned theater to watch this frosty film was like a blast of relief. The movie itself combines dark humor and wild visuals, Burton's very best big budget film.Batman (Michael Keaton) does indeed return, with a pair of villains to face this time -- abandoned child Oswald Cobblepot, aka the Penguin (Danny DeVito) and the less nefarious and more ambiguous Catwoman (Michelle Pfeiffer). DeVito's Penguin is at the same time less anarchic than Nicholson's Joker from the first film, and more of a threat to Batman because his schemes are more calculated and his political sensibilities more refined. As for the Catwoman, she and Batman strike up a kind of sadistic affair that's paralleled by the hesitant courtship between their alter egos, Bruce Wayne and Selena Kyle.DeVito is an excellent actor and a good choice for the Penguin, but his performance just can't match the kind of charm that Nicholson had in the first film. It's really Pfeiffer's sexy latex-draped Catwoman that makes the film. There's moments of great wit, like when she looks down at her ruined ""claw"" with an expression that suddenly takes her back to her secretary days (err... ""executive assistant""). There's also a nice performance by Christopher Walken (with the rather not-so-subtle homage name of Max Shreck) as a greedy crimelord. He gets more time to develop this outside villain than Jack Palance had in the first one, and brings a lot of moments of great humor to the relationship with the Penguin. You almost start to like him by the end, but his score with the Catwoman must be settled.The theme of the film is, once again, duality -- but it works somewhat better than the first film, because the relationship between Catwoman and Batman is more natural and compelling. I also like the one scene with the Penguin and Batman where Penguin accuses Batman of being jealous, ""you're not a real freak."" Really great ideas that are well developed in the interplay between these 3 bizarre personas and their alter-egos.As for Burton's direction, it's much more relaxed and distinctive in this film compared to the first one. A new Gotham set was built for Burton on the west coast (the first one was done in England), and the settings and style are more picturesque, dark, and expansive. You can tell that he had just done ""Edward Scissorhands"" and was really feeling his oats when he did this one, at the top of his game trying to top his previous effort. A lot of people, maybe Jack Nicholson fans, might disagree, but I thought that he got the tone and everything just right for this film. It's not too serious but it's also not too goofy; rather than alternating moments of seriousness and camp we get in the first film, this one has a more consistent tone as well.",Batman Returns
81,Anonymous_Maxine,Tim Burton's follow-up to his tremendously successful Batman (1989) has the same look and feel but just doesn't achieve the same level of adventure and sheer quality.,6,18 January 2003,"In comic book films like the Batman movies, the thing that has to be there, that is at least as important as having a title character that the audience will love to love, is to have a good bad guy, and that means someone that is wonderfully hate-able and has the power to make us fear him or her. The bad guy has to be intimidating, even for us as member's of the audience. Jack Nicholson was able to add his cynical charm to the Joker to make us like him, but just enough to allow us to hate him at the same time, maybe even as a result. His parade through the crowded streets of Gotham City where he gleefully gassed thousands and thousands of people was more than enough to illustrate the extent of his madness and his hatred for mankind in general, but Danny DeVito's Penguin is just not a scary character, no matter which way you look at him.The biggest problem here is that the Penguin teams up with a corrupt businessman (Max Shrek, played brilliantly by Christopher Walken), and even goes so far to run for Mayor of Gotham City. These are not the kinds of things that comic book villains do, and he came off as little more than a hideously ugly candidate for mayor with plans to make himself massively rich off the poor suckers of Gotham. DeVito is one of our few actors who is able to consistently play shady characters who are flawlessly convincing and yet strangely likable, and his talent is completely devoured here in the enormity of the prosthetics that he is forced to endure for this role, which does not do him justice as an actor in any way.Christopher Walken is also an actor who is almost incapable of filling a role without making it hugely entertaining, and he is completely wasted and misused here. Not only is his enormous charisma swallowed up by his goofy mad scientist wig the way DeVito's is by his repulsive costume, but he plays the role of a corrupt businessman that he just doesn't fit in. Like Denzel Washington in Training Day, Walken does not work well here because he is forced to play a character that he is simply too likable to pull off. He does as well as can be expected, and his screen presence was more than welcomed anytime he was onscreen, but the role just doesn't fit him.I love the role that Walken plays, by the way. I am not sure whether this is a throwback to the earlier actor (although it almost seems like it's just too much of a coincidence not to be), but of course you remember Max Shrek as the mysterious actor who played the vampire in the 1922 horror film, Nosferatu. I won't go into too much detail here, but this is one of the most fascinating mystery biographies in movie history, so much so that an entire film was made about this actor only a few years ago, The Shadow of the Vampire, which I highly recommend. Michael Keaton is back again, thankfully, to play the part of the caped crusader (unfortunately for the last time, since they HAD to keep making Batman sequels), filling the role with charm and personality, and Michael Gough is also back perfecting as Alfred and returning as one of the only actors to have been in all four (thus far) Batman films. Michael Keaton and Michael Gough work so well in their roles that it's amazing the series was even able to survive (although whether or not it survived or just became a dead horse will vary, depending on who you ask) when Michael Keaton stopped taking on the role of Batman. I remember when I was in high school I was amazed at how sexy Michelle Pfeiffer looks in that hot little latex Catwoman outfit, but watching now that I'm a senior in college, she just doesn't have the same effect. Instead of being captivated by her incredibly sexy body, the first thing I noticed was her slutty eye-shadow and glowingly bright red lipstick (which is so overpowering in an otherwise almost colorless movie that it almost seems to dance around the screen by itself like the grin of the Cheshire Cat), I was instead amazed at how obvious it is that the Catwoman is meant to have this loose sexual appeal, which I like to think fades drastically as maturity increases. Pfeiffer was able to fulfill this at the time, but I think that she as an actor has matured and taken on more respectable roles since, so that looking back it's almost like looking at some foolish thing you might have done in your own younger days. Batman Returns is entertaining in that it is such a visible spectacle and it is so interesting to watch the new characters, but overall it is a disappointment because it just doesn't have the same substance of the original. There are interesting new characters, but they are little more than strange creations than creatures in themselves, things to be looked at rather than entertained by, leaving this installment in the Batman series as a skeleton of what it could have and should have been. Fans of the old comics are sure to be put off by things like this, as are die-hard fans of the original films, but the kids, I'm sure, are going to love it.",Batman Returns
82,Vartiainen,"At times silly, at times Gothic, at times dark and gripping",6,3 September 2012,"You can see a lot of Tim Burton in this film, for better and for worse. His trademark Gothic style is heavily presented in the design of Gotham City and its various occupants, most of which are either tormented and dark heroes or complete monsters trying to pass as normal citizens. Unfortunately Burton's flair for over the top character is also present, which at times makes it hard to take this film seriously. The Penguin (Danny DeVito) is probably the biggest offender in this regard. Some of his scenes are downright terrifying, with him wobbling around and acting more like a wild beast than a man. But then he wobbles some more, this time clad in nothing but his dirty pyjamas, and the illusion of terror shatters almost instantly. The same applies to his dialogue. It's an odd mix of silliness and threat that either works brilliantly or utterly fails, there's very little middle ground with this character.This same ambivalence is present in almost all of the characters, with the exception of Batman (Michael Keaton), although he has his own flaws as well, the biggest being that he's not really the focus of the film. This film is more about the Penguin and the Catwoman (Michelle Pfeiffer). Batman is just there to move the plot along, which makes him rather uninteresting, which is a cardinal offence in my books, as this is a Batman film after all.All that being said, the plot of this film isn't that bad. Batman: The Animated Series once did an episode about the Penguin trying to join the normal, civilized society, trying to combat his inner weirdness and the prejudice of the common folk, who fear his odd appearance and animalistic themes. That episode really worked in my opinion and why not, as it is a very good idea for this particular character. The Penguin, like so many other Batman villains, is all about duality - in his case about the battle between his noble heritage and his savage upbringing, which makes for a great tragedy. And while the movie doesn't explore these themes as well as it perhaps could have, it touches upon many of them and at least makes the effort to try.Still, I just can't get past all those silly scenes where the previous Gothic mood completely shatters and the whole process starts all over again with the next scene. If you're a fan of Burton or Batman, you should give this one a try as it is a rather touching film and good one in its own way, but if you can't deal with sudden mood changes and a certain level of random silliness, this movie really isn't for you.",Batman Returns
83,gwnightscream,"""Good Sequel That's As Dark As The First!""",7,12 May 2012,"Michael Keaton, Danny DeVito, Michelle Pfeiffer and Christopher Walken star in Tim Burton's 1992 action sequel. This begins in Gotham City, with a wealthy couple, The Copplepots dumping their deformed penguin-like infant, Oswald into a sewer. Years later, the man who has been hiding beneath Gotham, The Penguin (DeVito) kidnaps a shady politician, Max Schreck (Walken) who is running for Mayor and blackmails him. Pfeiffer (Scarface) plays Schreck's secretary, Selina Kyle who gets pushed out a window by Schreck for snooping around his office and becomes vengeful, Catwoman. She also gets involved with billionaire, Bruce Wayne (Keaton) whom she learns is Batman. Soon, Batman faces The Penguin who is determined to reclaim his birthright while trying to overrun Gotham and Catwoman who wants revenge on Schreck. Burton's ""Pee-wee's Big Adventure"" stars, Paul Reubens & Diane Salinger briefly play Oswald's parents. This is a good sequel that's as dark as the first, Keaton, DeVito and Pfeiffer are great, Danny Elfman's score is excellent and Walken is a good bad guy as usual. I recommend this.",Batman Returns
84,lisafordeay,Batman set at Christmas time,7,11 January 2021,"Batman Returns is the sequel to the 1989 film directed by Tim Burton and is also the last time Micheal Keaton portrays Batman as Val Kilmer was the next actor to play Batman. This time Michelle Pfeiffer, Danny DeVito and Christopher Walken star alongside Keaton. Story is about a deformed man dubbed Penguin (DeVito in heavy prosthetics)who teams up with Max(Walken),while Max's ex assistant Selina (Pfeiffer) seeks revenge on Max as he tried to kill her only to be resurrected by cats. So will Batman save Gotham City once again. Its not as bad as what audience members state it as but the 1989 one was far more superior. If you love Tim Burton and his gothic movies with Danny Elfman's score then you'll probably like it. Michelle Pfeiffer to me was really good as she stole the entire thing for me with her seductive flirtatious ways and how she portrays Catwoman(sorry Halle Berry but yours was just meh).6.9/10",Batman Returns
85,GOWBTW,This one is much darker!,8,11 May 2008,"The sequel to the 1989 hit has come. This time, he takes on two villains: The Penguin(Danny DeVito) aka Oswald Cobblepot and the Catwoman(Michelle Pfieffer) aka Selina Kyle. These two would have made the perfect team. However, Catwoman has her own agenda, and The Penguin teams with a dirty businessman named Max Shreck(Christopher Walken). This man is worse than Carl Grissom who was killed by the Joker. The duo first scheme is to smear the Dark Knight. Second, is for the Mayor to be recalled. The plan worked, unfortunately the partnership of Penguin and Catwoman was short lived. And Batman had to reveal the Pengiun's true nature at a conference. And the cheers turn into jeers. The action was great with the Batmobile when it becomes the Batmissle. And the suit of Batman's is sharp. The movie was great, but the plot could have more depth to it. It was a bit hollow, and it was very much darker than the first one. Still a good movie though. 3 out of 5 stars!",Batman Returns
86,FiendishDramaturgy,Disappointing but not dismal Burton sequel,8,1 October 2003,"The campy, carnival-like atmosphere above ground, while utter insanity in the guise of the Penguin stalks the city, beneath. Sounds intriguing to watch, doesn't it?But Gotham City just isn't what it used to be. Gone, are the beautifully designed Gothic structures, replaced by gadgetry and standard, disappointing Hollywood fluff. There is plenty of eye candy, but that does not distract you from the fact that so much else is lacking. Has Burton lost his edge? I wouldn't think so. But in this attempt, he resorts to obvious fifth-grader tactics to amuse us; ie: the Penguin drooling black filth from his mouth throughout most of his scenes (what WAS that crap, anyway?), and killer clowns (which were oh so reminiscent of the detrital film, ""Killer Klowns from Outer Space"" and the 60's camp of Adam West). While this production was still quite entertaining, it held none of the wondrous edge from the original masterpiece. I did, however, love the performances of the principal actors; Michael Keaton as Batman (Bruce Wayne), Danny DeVito as The Penguin/Oswald Cobblepot, Michelle Pfeiffer as Catwoman/Selina Kyle, Christopher Walken as Max Shreck, and that wonderful Michael Gough as Alfred Pennyworth. Their portrayals were quite professional; the character depth was well developed and everyone contributed what I feel was their very best. What lacked here, in my opinion, was that lovely darkling nightmarish feel from the first. The Dark Knight having been turned into the Light Grey Knight, Gotham (Gothic) City was dismayingly morphed into a Carnival Midway, and the allowance of the horrid 60's camp at which we all groaned and rolled our eyes to creep into this otherwise darkly amusing production was just purely wrong. Sorry, but I fail to find having my gag reflex triggered to be entertaining. Honestly, I was still amused by this flick. DiVito's talent for acting is above reproach, though I found his constant black drool to be completely repulsive and it turned me off of his character totally. Again, that falls into the area of directing, and in no way cheapens his performance. Michelle Pfeiffer's Catwoman was mildly reminiscent of Eartha Kitt's portrayal and thus endeared the character. While she delivered her own style and talents to the characters of Seline and Catwoman, she portrayed Catwoman beautifully as a witty, intelligent seductress. Hers was a wonderful performance and I loved the perpetuation of the romance between Batman and Catwoman. ""It's the so-called normal guys who always let you down. Sickos never scare me. At least they're committed."" Seline to Bruce Wayne. The attempt to humanize Bruce Wayne was a serious mistake. Gone is the edgy, almost sinister feel to the Gothic hero, the ""Dark Knight."" Enter, instead, the comedic equivalent; this reincarnation of a masterpiece. It didn't work for me on any level. Bruce Wayne, cracking jokes, forgetting his coat over some piece of fluff girl, and snapping off one-liners to the bad guys as he pretends to kick their butts. What a disappointment after the last Burton attempt.I found the change to be sad, rather than fresh or edgy. There were several points of this production that I found to be quite unoriginal. Penguin's plan to kidnap/kill the first born sons of Gotham was rather Biblesque and lame. The James Bondesque music during Shreck's party was rather tasteless. As I mentioned before, the whole movie had a ""Killer Klowns from Outer Space"" feel to it beneath the failed attempt to be Gothic and dark as the original from which this spawned. The voice designated to Penguin's computer alert system at the climax of the movie was very V'ger-like (Star Trek: the Motion Picture), bordering on identical. And I've got one question. If the Penguin's army is penguins, and he himself identifies with penguins...WHY is he driving around in something as infantile as a rubber duck? Just another contrived and trashy element I found disturbing and unattractive. ""How outstanding! You're Beauty AND the Beast, in one luscious Christmas gift-pack."" Penguin.While this production fell short of the first, it was still a fun and enjoyable movie, if only for the performances of the main players. I am frankly glad that Burton will not be directing the next installment of this, the ""modern"" Batman series. I am looking forward to Jim Carey and Tommy Lee Jones's performances. But Val Kilmer in the leading role? We'll just have to wait and see. This one rates a 8.1/10 from...the Fiend :.",Batman Returns

I didn't like it like I did the original Batman and walked away really only appreciating Michelle's outfit.I mean...I was 12 and...hell, I still appreciate it.Thank you for that Cat Woman outfit.But I was 12 then and it was sort of disturbing and they made Danny DeVito look absolutely disgusting and I was so not a fan of that at 12...which goes to show you how things change because now I love how they made Danny DeVito look positively disgusting.Now I appreciate the stellar job they did in transforming him, and now I love how he took to the part and...well, I have so much respect for what he did with that role. He was his own kind of crazy. He did a better job than Jack did in the first one and Jack is always a pleasure to watch.So now that I am 37 it's still ""Thank you for the Cat Woman outfit,"" with ""DeVito was awesome in this!!!!!"" screamed at the top of my lungs.And of course you still have Keaton playing Bruce Wayne playing Batman, which adds even more depth now that the series has continued and....Walken.Walken is like Jackson, you'll sit through a crap movie because he's in it won't you?

88,freemantle_uk,Best of the Pre-Nolan Batmans,8,5 August 2008,"When Tim Burton made the Batman film did was not too happy about the film he made. He only returned to the franchise because he was allowed to make the film he wanted and you get to see some of his directional traits.The basic plot of the film is a new criminal master-mind, The Penguin (Danny De Vito), is conquering the underworld of Gotham and starting a new rain of terror during Christmas. He captures a major industrialist Max Shreck (Christopher Walken) and holds him to blackmail. Out of anger of being found out Shreck kills his secretary Selina Kyle (Michelle Pfeiffer). She however is brought back to life and she becomes Cat-woman. The three work together and form a plan to take over the city and destroy Batman. A part of the plan is for the Pengiun to 'save' the mayor's son and find out who he really is before running for mayor himself. At the same time Bruce Wayne is forming a relationship with Selina whilst at the same time fighting Catwoman as Batman.This film is darker in tone to Batman and has themes like child-abandonment and child-killing. There is some good casting, Danny De-Vito and Walken are good in there roles, but Pfeiffer was the best casting in the film. However, there are problems with the film, firstly, there is too much focus on the villains, and not enough on Batman. Bruce Wayne is not made out to be an interesting character compared to the Nolan films. Secondly I thought that even this film, whilst it is fairly dark, I still thought that was cartoonary like the penguins and henchmen. I'm also not a great fan of the Gothic style that was used, but considering it's Burton's film it what he does.Batman Returns is best until Nolan comes along. The problem with the executives at Warner Brothers was they though Batman was a family friendly character (he isn't) and did not like what Burton came up with. This was the reason why Joel Schumacher was brought in and made the bad Batman Forever and even worst Batman and Robin.",Batman Returns
89,dee.reid,It was the night before Christmas in Gotham City...,9,9 December 2005,"On a cold, snowy night one time in Gotham City, a rich couple gave birth to their first and (presumably) last child. The child is deformed and is assumed a safety risk. A few nights or weeks later, on a nightly stroll through the park, the couple has decided to toss the baby and its carriage over a bridge, where it is gently taken by the still waters into the sewer.It was on this same night in 1992, that director Tim Burton gave rise to the dynamic, multi-layered sequel to his 1989 blockbuster with ""Batman Returns."" It's darker, moodier, sexier and more vibrant than ""Batman,"" and maybe even the Dark Knight's creator Bob Kane might be happy with Burton's vision. Or maybe not. It isn't better than its predecessor, but is at least on a certain level of creativity, if nothing else is ever as spectacular this time around.Burton's specialty is freaks, and they wear their hearts on all sleeves, if they wore sleeves. Burton has surrounded himself with freakish visual delights, circus outcasts and three figures struggling with ""dual identities"" this time in Gotham City as the Christmas holidays are rapidly approaching, and so the criminals are also out raising hell and who do the scared innocents call: Batman.The Penguin (Danny DeVito, perfectly hideous under a ton of Oscar-nominated Stan Winston prosthetics) is largely responsible for this new crime wave, as he aspires to rise to power in Gotham City's government, with the reluctant aid of corrupt business mogul Max Shreck (Christopher Walken), whose proposed power plant will drain the city of power once brought online. The Penguin's devious plot is shrouded in mystery from the masses, however, by his desire to find his identity and make peace with his now deceased parents, adopting the birth name ""Oswald Cobblepot."" More on this later.Meanwhile, Bruce Wayne (Michael Keaton) is onto Cobblepot and Shreck's plans, but his DUAL IDENTITY as Batman will have to be put on hold when Shreck's mousy secretary... uh, executive assistant... uh, secretary Selina Kyle (Michelle Pfeiffer) adopts her DUAL IDENTITY as the S & M-leather-bondage Catwoman after taking a swan dive out of a top-floor window, is resurrected by friendly felines, and becomes the object of Bruce's desires. Will they let their DUAL INDENTITIES as the Bat and the Cat get in the way of their passion, or will they live happily ever after?It could be stated ""Batman Returns"" is probably the sexiest and introspective (but does not reach the level of sophistication found in the first ""Batman"") of Burton's Gothic vehicles. Pfeiffer seems to be having the most fun as Catwoman - sexy, delicious, vicious - a role many felt was lacking with Halle Berry's continuation of the character 12 years later in the ""Batman Returns"" spin off, ""Catwoman."" Keaton is fulfilling once again as the Dark Knight, as his relationship this time with a romantic interest has a little more steam, much to the surprise of faithful butler Alfred (Michael Gough).But as usual (and aside from Pfeiffer's sexy curvatures), Burton indulges in the visuals (which are beautiful, but so is Catwoman), but it could also be argued he leaves his players out in the cold in favor of the former. The romance between Bruce and Selina is almost non-existent by the time the credits roll, but Burton makes the effort to really explore the dark depths of his characters in the sequel and their struggles with alternate lives, giving reason to their troubling ways of causing mischief in Gotham City.Speaking of mischief, again, The Penguin's plans to run for mayor are overshadowed by his current two-fold operation of systematically murdering Gotham's first-born children, biblical-style, by drowning them in the sewers from where he has risen, and framing Batman for the kidnapping of the Ice Princess (Cristi Conaway).Action is plentiful, as the three main characters are given enough screen time to live out their roles. Danny Elfman's score is there this time too, in order to back its frequent scenes of action and mayhem. Director Burton may have outdone himself on this sequel, as it was his last chance at the Dark Knight, as was also Keaton's.It will be a darker, stormier night in Gotham City when Batman, The Penguin, and Catwoman decide to get together and have themselves a Christmas party.9/10",Batman Returns

For Better or Worse",5,12 August 2019,"If Tim Burton was on a studio leash with 1989's Batman, he's been completely unchained for this one. The entire film drips with the director's influence, from the eerie set decorations (characteristic black and white stripes abound) and twisted fairy tale atmosphere to the oddball cameos (dig Pee-Wee Herman and his Big Adventure co-star Simone as the Penguin's parents) and hypnotic Danny Elfman score. Throw in a heavily-costumed Danny DeVito, overacting his heart out as a creepy, deformed, sewer-dwelling foil and Christopher Walken, doing his most wild-eyed, exaggerated Christopher Walken impression, and you've got... a mystifying ensemble, to say the least. Elsewhere, Michelle Pfeiffer turns in the film's most memorable performance as an unhinged secretary-turned-feline and leading man Michael Keaton once again plays a supporting role in his own movie, greatly troubled by all the unbridled insanity unfolding around him.In many ways, Batman Returns goes out of its way to distance itself from its predecessor, while still trying to ape the bleak atmosphere and sheer quotability of the original. Those tricks don't work half as well this time, feeling more like a forced obligation than a natural eccentricity. Maybe the writing team lost its spark, or maybe DeVito, Pfeiffer and Keaton can't put as much sheen on a silly line as Jack Nicholson could. Whatever the cause, this one underperforms.

Now Michael Keaton reprises his role as Bruce Wayne/Batman and once again he puts in a wonderful performance.

Now one negative like both the Burton's and Schumacher Batman films is the role of Commissioner Gordon his character is just a waste of space and not needed throughout any of these films and this upsets me after seeing what Christopher Nolan has done with the character. The story is nothing special either the motivations of both The Penguin and Catwoman aren't revealed till the very end and this really shows that the story wasn't a true priority apart from Shreck's story. The script was decent but nothing special and it doesn't really seem that it was a problem. The style of the film was truly a mixed bag though the style of the main characters and this Christmassy Gotham which is cool. But the Burton costumes created are rubbish and they really make it feel like a cartoon at times. The soundtrack is great and helps add the tension. This film is decent but with more mistakes then the first Batman.,Batman Returns
97,MaxBorg89,Welcome back to Tim Burton's freak-show,9,13 October 2005,"More than its predecessor, this movie really belongs to its director.Just read the plot summary: a disfigured child turns into the revolting Penguin(Danny De Vito), who plans revenge on Gotham City with evil businessman Max Schreck(Christopher Walken).They'll have to face two problems: Batman(Michael Keaton),the city's vigilante who spends his nights tracking down and arresting criminals, and Selina Kyle(Michelle Pfeiffer), Schreck's ex-secretary, back from the dead as the fascinating yet deadly Catwoman.It contains all of Burton's favorite stuff:extreme outcasts feared by ordinary people, a dark and Gothic landscape covered with snow(Gotham City at Christmas is visually delighting) and references to old horror movies(Christopher Walken played the lead in a seminal horror flick, as did the actor his character is named after).As in the previous film, it's more about Batman's opponents than the Caped Crusader himself.It's got little to do with Bob Kane's characters and all to do with Burton's creepy, twisted imagination.It's a film noir with a weird romance and even weirder heroes and villains.Just don't get fooled by the foreboding climax: the two subsequent flicks have nothing in common with this one, except the titular guy, not to mention that they're really awful.Anyway, this is a perfect introduction, alongside Edward Scissorhands, to Burton's genius, in case you haven't seen Charlie and the Chocolate Factory yet.",Batman Returns
98,iquine,Cleverly Creative & Fun,9,19 February 2018,"(Flash Review)This felt similar to me from the original Batman movie with Keaton, Nicholson and Basinger, which was great thanks to worlds only Tim Burton can create and the wonderful score only Danny Elfman can dream up. DeVito was stellar as the visually repugnant Penguin living in the gruesomeness of Gotham City's sewers. He is the core of this film as he tries to learn who his parents are and why he was discarded soon after birth as well as being respected by the city he lives underneath with a political scheme accompanied by Max Shreck (Walken). Additionally, we learn how Catwoman (Pfeiffer) comes to be and she later joins Penguin in attempting to foil and frame Batman. So lots of fun characters in a realistic-feeling world, free from much(?) CGI, giving this movie an honest and gritty atmosphere. Keaton is the best Batman in my opinion and his dialog, along with the others, have amusing double meanings at times. This is a well-written, directed, scored, acted and visually creative movie with fun energy and tension. A classic Hollywood success.",Batman Returns
99,smatysia,"Not bad, not great",6,15 December 2003,"Not bad, not great. It helps if one comes into this film remembering that this is a COMIC BOOK STORY!!! (By the way, when did comic books get euphemized to ""graphic novels""?) Actually, though, I never read the ""Batman"" comics. (I did like the '60's TV show, but hey, I was seven. Surely that show's target demographic.) I liked it that Batman is dark and brooding, and not a happy superhero. The cast all did well, playing the material properly, as a comic book, and not doing realism. And anything with Michelle Pfeiffer in it is worth seeing. Worth a look. Grade: B-",Batman Returns
100,jimbo-53-186511,"Suffers from messy storytelling, but the good performances do enough to make it worth seeing",6,29 August 2021,"Wealthy businessman Max Schreck wants to build a new power plant, but the current mayor objects deeming it to be unnecessary. Max forms an alliance with a reclusive sewer-dweller known as 'The Penguin' and uses the Penguin as a pawn for his scheme (putting him forward for the role of mayor). When the 2 begin framing Batman for a series of crimes in Gotham City, Batman finds himself fighting to clear his name. Along for the ride is Catwoman who has an agenda of her own...The original Batman film was a bit weak when it came to its storytelling, but in its defence its narrative was focused, linear and straight-forward.The problem with Returns is that once it gets going it goes off in all directions resulting in its narrative being messy and unfocused. Many story strands feel half-baked and either start and don't end or come to an abrupt halt. One such example was Cobblepot's desire to find his parents - did that really add anything to the story?The inclusion of more characters in Returns gives the film a more upscale feel to it than the original film. Of course sometimes the problem with having more characters in the film is that they can sometimes get in the way of one another and harm the flow of the story and that's exactly what happens here. Returns feels too busy and never really seems to tell any one character's particular story (everything seems to be done in a half-hearted manner). Even the main focus of 'The Penguin' becoming mayor never seems to quite reach its potential.The upside of upscaling the film with a bigger cast is that, when you have the right talents on-board, the film will invariably be very entertaining. Burton and co got that aspect right and the likes of Danny DeVito and Pfeiffer in particular are superb. The former in particular is excellent and is the real star of the show here (like Nicholson was in the original only DeVito has the edge for me as he wasn't as hammy as Nicholson).If you enjoyed the first film then chances are that you will like this film as it is just as entertaining in my book. It's a pity that the story was a bit all over the place as it did slightly harm what was otherwise an enjoyable film.",Batman Returns
101,snoozejonc,It's the so called normal guys who let you down. Sickos never scare me. At least they're committed.,9,30 August 2021,"Batman faces several villains in an effort to protect Gotham city.'Batman Returns' is a great sequel by Tim Burton with wonderful visuals and memorable characters.The plot is character-driven, with freak-like individuals who clash in the darkly humorous and gothic backdrop of Gotham. The Penguin and Catwoman are portrayed as downtrodden outcasts with tragic origins like Batman. I think the development of these characters is the most compelling aspect of the movie.Immediately from the opening credits we learn the Penguin's story with fantastic visuals and it continues throughout the movie. This is a memorable character thanks to the makeup, costuming, and Danny DeVito's raging, lecherous and truly disgusting performance.The Penguin's credibility as an antagonist is aided by the inclusion of the Max Schreck character. Christopher Walken lends his immense charisma to a character who embodies a greedy, ruthless business mogul looking to exploit everything and everyone for his own gain. His portrayal works as an instrument for the Penguin's rise to prominence and to further corrupt the soul of Gotham City. His character also serves as a CATalyst to development of Selina Kyle.Kyle is portrayed as a lonely city dweller implied to have a diminishing fairytale outlook on life before her dramatic rebirth as Catwoman. Her character is wonderfully presented by the set design of her apartment and Michelle Pfeiffer's phenomenally entertaining performance. She has the best lines in the movie and delivers them with great comic timing. In fact as Catwoman she lights up the screen with each appearance and steals most scenes.As you would expect from a Burton picture, the art direction is brilliant. I love the grim facist style of Gotham Plaza, the murky sewers, the derelict zoo and the atmospheric interiors. There is more than hint of Citizen Kane about a number of images and themes, particularly the huge Wayne Manor fireplace, bleakness of winter, parental abandonment and general feelings of isolation driving many of characters.Ultimately it is a comic book movie and it builds to solid confrontation involving all the main characters. It might not have the modern day effects and computer assisted spectacle, but it is a triumphant piece of filmmaking.For me it is an 8.5/10 but I round upwards.",Batman Returns
102,Catherine_Grace_Zeh,"Excellent, nail-biting, edge-of-your-seat, action-packed ride of a sequel",9,27 November 2006,"Wow! This is really an excellent, nail-biting, edge-of-your-seat action-packed ride of a sequel that is based on one of the best comics of all time! That is the main thing that I can say about BATMAN RETURNS. When Batman (Michael Keaton) and Catwoman (Michelle Pfeiffer) were squaring off against each other, I got really squeamish. It's hard for me to tell you specifically why. In addition, when Catwoman ate the Penguin's (Danny DeVito) bird, I got really grossed out. Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say that everything about this movie was good, especially the performances, which I believe were top-grade. Now, in conclusion, I recommend this excellent, nail-biting, edge-of-your-seat, action-packed ride of a sequel that is based on one of the best comics of all time to all you Michael Keaton or Michelle Pfeiffer fans who haven't seen it. When you see this movie, hold on tight and prepare to be taken on a wild ride. I guarantee you you'll be blown away.",Batman Returns
103,NateWatchesCoolMovies,"Fantastic, best in the franchise after Dark Knight",10,1 December 2015,"Tim Burton's Batman Returns is my second favourite Batman movie thus far. It's pretty underrated, stylishly cheeky and full of ornate, wonderfully oppressive, melancholic set design and drips with a Gothic sensability that only Burton included in his versions, and seems to be missing from the franchise these days. It's dark, comical and just a little bit campy, always a winning combination. Michael Keaton steps back into the batsuit for a second time, and he's even more somber and downbeat than in Burton's original 1989 film. Keaton is so talented, and one only needs to look at his zany work in Beetlejuice and compare it to the heft and restraint he shows as the caped crusader to see this. Here he's faced with a snowy, blackened and endlessly corrupt Gotham City, this time under siege from three wildly different villains. Danny Devito plays Oswald Cobblepot, a.k.a. The Penguin, in what is probably the most outlandish character in the otherwise grim film. He's a bad tempered, knobbly little gremlin, encased in sallow makeup and sporting disgusting, pasty little flippers. It's hard to tell it's even Devito at all until that little smart ass mouth opens up to hurl calculated obscenities at anyone and everyone. He aims to be mayor, and only in freaky deaky Gotham would a plan like that ever be taken seriously, from a sewer dwelling, animalistic mobster with an army of clowns following him. Christopher Walken plays evil, ghoulish Max Schreck, an amoral monster of a businessman with nefarious plans of his own, and a haircut that would make Andy Warhol run for cover. Last and most memorable is Michelle Pfeiffer as Selina Kyle, Schreck's awkward, meek secretary who eventually becomes Catwoman. And what a Catwoman she is. Forget Anne Hathaway, Julie Newmar take a number, and we won't even mention Halle Berry. No one played the pussy quite like Pfeiffer. She's got a shiny, skin tight outfit with the body to match, a sassy, sexy attitude, a whip smart mouth on her and just a hint of psychosis, making her my favourite film incarnation of the character. ""Meow"" she purrs sensually as an incendiary bomb detonates behind her. Damn. They all get wrapped up in various schemes and scams. Penguin wants ultimate power, which apparently involves kidnapping a bunch of infants. Schreck wants ruthless progress to tear Old Gotham up in worship of the almighty dollar, and Catwoman is content to slash and burn everyone's plans, until she gets a bit of a smolder in her eye for Batman, providing some electric sexual tension between the two of them that's a highlight of the film. Neither of them are sure whether they want to kiss or kill, fight or fcvck the other, and it's devilishly entertaining watching them hash out their hormones in naughty little action sequences and slow, slinky intimate scenes, involving both Bruce and Selina as well as their feral alter egos. Their chemistry revolves at the center of the piece, with all manner of circus sideshow madness happening around them. Pat Hingle and Michael Gough diligently put in work as Commissioner Gordon and Alfred Pennyworth, with Doug Jones, Michael Murphy, Andrew Bryarniarski and Paul Reubens rounding out the roster. Burton outdid himself with style on this one, his trademark eye for loving detail laboriously employed here to the point where it surpasses the artistry of a comic book and starts to look like some mad dream of Vincent Price. He dipped his toe in the water of the Batman universe with his first outing. Here he plunges headlong into it and fully commits to a style and tone that's distilled to a satisfactory point that he wasn't quite at with Batman 1989. A treasure in the franchise, and a wicked fun film at that.",Batman Returns
104,Cristi_Ciopron,The much better Batman. The most delicious character in the superhero movies: Selina Kyle,9,17 September 2007,"This second Batman is much much better than the first one. It is plastically more accomplished, much better played, and maybe better written also.One thing is obvious:here Burton pushed the masquerade towards a vision.This is the Batman installment that has a vision,an inner principle;this is surprising. It has not atmosphere; but then no Burton movie has an atmosphere. The second Batman is much more suspenseful than the previous one. That one had Mrs. Basinger,it is truebut this one has Mrs. Pfeifferand this is even better. And these two fine ladies should not be compared, as they have entirely different roles in the two movies. But Mrs. Pfeiffer seems to be even more fun than Mrs. Basingerand Mrs. Basinger is great fun and a good reason to watch a movie.The second installment looks goodit looks VERY goodand I am not a fan of Burton's visual style. There are several amazing things in this filmI leave you the pleasure of discovering them. This is a stylish film indeedand, if not a vision, at least a spectacular masquerade. It does achieve several moments of truly fantastical texturealmost a twisted fairy-tale.It somehow reminded me also of some big '60s farces,such as Blake Edwards' The Great Race (1965) ,or Roman Polanski's Dance of the Vampires (1967).Yet,this one is made within the postmodern stance,so it is a spoof multiplied with itself.I am one of those who believe that Burton did not prove Keaton is such a good Batman character.A few days ago I was discussing the Batman '89's cast with a pal,and he found fault with Keaton casting as an ultra-cool enigmatic avenger and 'justiciary. But I didn't like any of the actors cast as superheroes in the '70s-'90s feature movies. They had Gibson and Gere and Willis and they came with  Keaton.Batman II has a sense of wonder and of dream, it's good this thing was made. It is fanciful and well-paced.I don't like Walken in Burton's movies,but Mrs. Pfeiffer is outstandingshe brings a charm and a note of poetry that are one of the main qualities of this movie.She is so very good for such an action role . In fact,for me, Batman II is her movie. I would even suggest that Selina Kyle is one of her signature roles.The Penguin was a very well-written character, a very well suited one, and an enjoyable notion in the movie. He is more interesting, as a villain, then the Joker. And increasing the number of Batman's enemies, or pseudo-enemies, or quasi-enemies proved to be an inspired decisionit's more fun this way, and it makes the narration more compact.I consider that Burton 's best films are Ed Wood (1994), Mars Attacks! (1996) and Batman Returns (1992) (but I have seen only 6 of themeverything he made from Batman Returns (1992) till Planet of the Apes, plus, of course, Batman ,1989). So everything that follows is based only on my experience with these 6 movies.Burton's poetics is one of the unreality it is a deliberate attitude, of course, but it must be also a thing of temperament. Unrealityas in Godard -but in an entirely different way, and with different means and purposes. But unrealityas Godard pumped it. There are no 'evocating angles in their films-no seizing of a piece of the world. A Golan-Globus film from the '80s contains more atmosphereof a street corner, etc., or of a pub, than all Burton's movies. Hence their quasi-academic look. The viewer's response depends on whether he enjoys this kind of postmodern take, or not. I do, sometimes. (By the way, I consider Godard, since I named him here,I consider Godard infinitely superior to Burton, it was not my intention to imply they are equals. )Burton's principle is a postmodern one, hence an epistemic one. Emptying the representation of any impetus towards imitation. Postmodernism is the epistemic response to realismmore of a crisis than of a response. Burton 's films are giant vacuum machines. I see he wants them to be thishe plans them to be this way.Camping up the camp is itself a very camp thing to do. Mocking the camp is still camp; or it is rather even campier. It is true that the camp-aware camp is odd. It betrays, yet it still does belong.So, camp comes to have an odd relation with itself. Spoofing a movie is no way of doing homage (the presupposition is that ""we"" can not enjoy those referenced movies as they are, and that we need some spoofing versions .)Burton pretends not only that the ingenuity is lost forever,but also that he is much smarter than those he says he quotes.You see that he is proud he's not Ray Harryhausen, Vincent Price,Edward D. Wood Jr, he would be ashamed to be one of them, for where are the humbleness, the ingenuity, the straightforward camp?The mere and humble enjoyment of the camp?Batman could of been a great chanceit needed the vision of a William Dieterle or Ludwig Berger, Michael Powell and Tim Whelan (as a triplet ).Burton's movies would not have made Price,Price. Spoofing is not continuing. Burton's movies are spoofs, parodies, masquerades, and they discredit the films they spoof.They seem to be made by a man who did not understand the movies he was spoofing. Even for his genre of masquerades, Burton has an unique inability of creating life.It has to be acknowledged that Burton shares with Soderbergh and the Coen brothers the top of the snobs' preferences.They are glad they were told what to think about these guys' movies,and so they can play the same repertory of clichés about post-modernism et Al. Burton, Soderbergh, the Coens live by discrediting genres. But that's not such a bad thing. Sometimes it is amusing and funny.",Batman Returns
105,davispittman,My favorite batman film ever!!!! Luv it in every part,9,15 February 2015,"This Tim Burton film, batman returns is definitely the darkest of the 4. But I love the way they portrayed Catwoman and the Penguin. Michelle Pfeiffer was the PERFECT choice for Catwoman, sexy and mysterious, just the way Catwoman should be. I think that this film is far better than the 1989 Batman. And seriously there is no one better to play the Penguin than Danny Daveito. And the script was very very sharp. I loved every scene in this movie. And Michael Keaton was great as Batman just like in the first film. And I also love the way Burton made Gotham look very slick and cool. Now, many parents were unhappy with this film being darker than the original, and I do understand that, but Really it wasn't all that terribly dark to me. I just think maybe some of those parents were sheltering they're child a little too much. Sooo pleased with this movie. Really, the best one in the 4 filmed franchise.

The corrupted Businessman (Oscar-Winner:Christopher Walken), who helps The Penguin raise Power in Gotham City.Directed by Tim Burton (Beetlejuice, Pee Wee's Big Adventure, Sleepy Hallow) made an clever sequel with plenty of black comedy and visual style. This is a much more fascinating film than Burton's original Batman. This has an great moody score by Danny Elfman (The Frighteners, Nightbreed, The Nightmare Before Christmas). Although this was not as successful as the original Batman at the box office. It seems that Warner Bros executives didn't want Burton to directed the third Batman film.The two disc set has plenty of good features.

Disc two has an documentary, plenty of featurettes, music video and the original theatrical trailer. Still, this was one of the highest grossing films of 1992.

The plot in between time, however, is fairly dull even though it is original.

It's about the hideous Penguin (Devito) that gets together with well respected monster Max Shreck (Walken) and runs for mayor. People soon realize that he is a horribly evil monster. We also have Selina Kyle (Pfieffer) that is just a timid assistant to Max Shreck until she snoops around too much and Shreck shoves her out a window for dead, but instead she becomes skitophrenic and becomes Catwoman. Batman fights both of these people and also falls in love with Selina Kyle, not knowing shes Catwoman. I loved the films wonderful sets and dark tone, but it's not for everyone. Another positive in this film is the wonderful score that is much improved on from the last Batman film (by Danny Elfman).

Thank the Lord for special effects. Batman Returns not only has excellent performances from Danny DeVito and Michelle ""Pussy Cat"" Pfeiffer, but remains loyal to the original film having Michael Keaton return as Batman. Also, Batman Returns is set in a realistic ""Fictional"" city. The next two sequels to the Batman trilogy are set in fantasy lands right out of a 1970's comic book. Buildings that are 200 story long with giant Rome like statues that surround this crazy Gotham city. It goes to show you how special effects can carry a film.

For the most part, it was rather decent in its implementation and design, but it was just far too dark and unusual, like the set designers were in the middle of some acid trip while creating the backdrops of this film. I felt this should have been the last in the series, simply because Tim Burton took this film to a level that was too out there for most regular film goers to conceive. A decent film, but just too much to handle in regards to eye candy.",Batman Returns
111,Jonny_Numb,"doom, gloom, and a lotta ""kaboom""",5,26 February 2006,"Before tonight, it had been a whopping 14 years since I'd seen ""Batman Returns"" (upon its initial theatrical release)...probably because I didn't like it much the first time around. With old(er) age and a more well-rounded appreciation of cinema, I decided to give it another shot, and...well, it was a LITTLE better than I remember it being when I was a tyke. The plot has something to do with a deformed child dumped in the Gotham City sewer, who is befriended and raised by penguins, and somehow amasses a face-painted sideshow cult to do his bidding, rising to the ranks of Penguin (an extremely unrestrained Danny DeVito); meanwhile, put-upon secretary Selena Kyle (Michelle Pfeiffer) stumbles upon a shady deal her industrialist boss Max Shreck (Christopher Walken) is looking to pull, and is murdered for her efforts, only to be resurrected as Catwoman, a nimble minx in a bondage outfit. Batman (Michael Keaton) spends most of his time in the background of chaotic scenes, and is hardly in the movie. ""Batman Returns"" shows off director Tim Burton's big-budget stylistic flair, with a taste for the macabre and a morbid sense of humor; the script, however, takes a colossal misstep in putting the Penguin at the center of things, as he is easily the most obnoxious adversary the Caped Crusader has ever had to confront. His endless one-liners only randomly hit the funny bone, and the plot surrounding him feels fabricated. Catwoman has more seductive charm, as does Walken's Shreck, but even they can't detract from this overcooked movie.",Batman Returns
112,Steffi_P,"""An embarrassing lack of juice""",6,13 December 2011,"There is a tendency for directors with a unique look began to dominate cinema more than ever in the 90s. Directors like Tim Burton have a kind of mainstream popularity and creative control only really enjoyed by Cecil B. DeMille and Alfred Hitchcock in the classic era. This meant that, after a certain point, whatever project Tim Burton took on, it looked like a Tim Burton movie. When he filmed Batman in 1989, it was very much a Batman flick, but when he returned for the sequel, armed with the commercial bankability and industry respect that the first picture had earned him, was far more able to twist the production to his own vision.Burton was never outstanding at basic film-craft (otherwise he could be making dramas), but his substantial genius lies in his visual arts. Somewhat atypically for a director, he would have his production design team base everything on his own sketches. His instantly recognisable forms – a mix of Gothic nightmare and twee Americana – dominate Batman Returns. It's almost so much here that the sheer weirdness of it all overshadows the comic-book antics. There's also a lot of ""clever business"" too such as the point-of-view shot of the young Penguin looking out through the bars of his crib being mirrored by a point-of-view shot of his older self looking through the sewer grate. It is very Burton-esque to show things from the perspective of the villainous freak – and certainly very unusual for the mainstream.As can be expected, the cast members are a suitably over-the-top bunch. Danny de Vito hams it up gloriously with humour and just a little pathos. Michelle Pfeiffer milks those terribly corny lines for all they are worth. Add Christopher Walken into the mix and it seems the writers were spread-betting when it came to throwing in traditional Batman villains. As a result poor old Michael Keaton in the title role is a bit lost, which is a pity because he was excellent in the 1989 predecessor. The most honourable mention goes to Michael Gough, reprising his role as Albert the butler. You have to admire his dryness when he Pfeiffer recommends he pen a dirty limerick for the occasion, and he informs her one has just sprung to mind.Batman Returns is several notches below the earlier movie. It is simply too much of a collision between Burton's world and Batman's world, but there are a few things to be salvaged from the wreckage. For all its basic incoherence, the picture is filled with a wonderful dark humour and numerous silly ideas. Far from a classic, it is at least a good bit of fun, and of course it looks pretty good too.",Batman Returns
113,valleyjohn,That PVC catsuit !,7,11 March 2021,"I'm not a fan of Tim Burton at all . He's the kind of director who attempts to make movies for adults ( not those kind!) but they just turn out to look like they are made for big kids .
I quite enjoyed his first Batman film and I have to see this was fun in parts but at no stage was I drawn into that Batman world and that's what I wanted .Megalomaniac businessman Max Shreck sets a plot against Gotham City in motion. He is joined by Penguin, a deformed and rather deranged man abandoned at birth by respectable parents. Penguin, backed by hoodlums and real penguins, runs for mayor. The plot is further complicated by Selena, a wronged secretary who transforms into Catwoman, a villain with mixed motives.Firstly the good things . Obviously as as red hot blooded male ,seeing Michelle Pfeiffer in PVC has to be the highlight of the film !
It's also great to se Christopher Walken playing ...Christopher Walken !Now to the bad points . The whole movie has the look and feel of being filmed in a studio . The set feels restricted which makes the film feel a bit insular.
Secondly , Danny Di Vito has so much make up on he's unrecognisable and that very disappointing.

During this movie's theatrical run, McDonald's sold toys from the movie, although the film was marketed towards the teenage set. It was quite controversial at the time, which is why Batman Returns failed to outgross Batman yet broke the opening weekend record set by its predecessor, a record which would be broken by Jurassic Park as well as Batman Forever, with many other movies soon to follow, the last being Infinity War this year. As for the movie, it's a great movie to watch during the Christmas holidays, as it's set during christmas in Gotham City, where the Penguin and Catwoman team up to try to defeat Batman from saving the day!!! Here's a fun fact...this was the first film to get a wide release in Dolby Digital 5.1, but not the first mixed in it...that honor goes to Star Trek VI, which was given a test run during pre screenings (a 70mm 5.1 mix was used instead for select markets and was used for the dvd release). This is also the last good batman movie, as Forever and Batman and Robin are more kiddie like.",Batman Returns
117,alexanderdavies-99382,"Inferior follow-up ""Batman"" movie.",6,9 August 2017,"I remember when ""Batman Returns"" was released in the summer of 1992. The notices weren't overly positive. After seeing the film at the cinema, it isn't difficult to understand why. ""Batman Returns"" was issued straight onto video after the box office takings were disappointing. I was glad to see Michael Keaton, Michael Gough and Pat Hingle again and Danny DeVito was a reasonably effective Penguin villain. The film's drawbacks, are that the script is pretty moronic and the film sets are too restricted in that they are all within the confines of soundstages instead of being on location. The whole film looks artificial. Tim Burton's direction is good but it's hampered by the production values. Michael Keaton is less business-like this time as the Caped Crusader and that annoyed me. Michelle Pfeiffer is irritating more than alluring as Catwoman. She can't hold a candle to Julie Newmar's unique portrayal. Christopher Walken is over the top as business tycoon Max Schreck. There are some good action scenes which go some way toward redeeming ""Batman Returns"" but the negatives outweigh the positives for me.",Batman Returns
118,PredragReviews,"""Let's Make A Mayor!""",9,11 June 2016,"This is dark like the 1st film but more of a fairy theme. Christmas never seems to happen in this film but then I think director Tim Burton has a fascination for the magical anticipation of the run up to Christmas that is such a part of childhood-witness Nightmare Before Christmas too! Burton blends a number of myths and famous stories into this film- e.g. a bit of pied piper, Moses (Oswald Cobblepot being abandoned as a bay and put in a basket in the water) . It's a good basis for his take on the hero.I really feel the film captures the sense of divide between the rich and poor in this world, the costumes and fashion seem heavily influenced by the depression era 1930's fur coats and top hats for the rich, old dull looking clothes for the rest. For a film called ""Batman Returns"" it's interesting that Batman is hardly in it and there is basically no character development for him. Burton seems more interested in the villains, the Penguin and the morally ambiguous Cat-Woman the later of which sort of goes through quite an arc over the course of the film. In a way I might have preferred a story focused more on the battle between Batman and Cat-Woman and cut out all the silly baby murdering, circus show, giant rubber ducks and flying umbrellas.My main complaint about the film is the use at the end of it of 'rocket strapped commando penguins', the dark Gothic tone was ruined for me at that moment, it just came across as a bit wacky and goofy. De Vito as the penguin though was a great choice and he's clearly having a ball with the role. The film also lacks the strong emotional connection which Bruce Wayne and Alfred have in the Nolan version, in this version though Bruce Wayne is more mature than the Christina Bale version and seems to need less emotional support. The film really succeeds in capturing the comic book feel of Batman with the set design, haunting visuals, great lines and Wonderful villains.Overall rating: 9 out of 10.",Batman Returns
119,WeAreLive,Good but not as good as the previous one,6,19 September 2017,"This film was good and it had a lot of action in but there were flaws in it.Most of the characters were gone from the previous film without any reason (Jim Gordan, Harvey Dent, and Viki Vale).The woman who played Selena Kyle was hot in this movie considering I wasn't born when this movie came out but a horrible miscast as Catwoman. The actor who played Penguin though was good.Like I said this movie was good but not Batman 1989 good.",Batman Returns
120,brando647,Tim Burton Returns to Gotham,7,21 February 2010,"Tim Burton's second adventure in Gotham City is another impressive film, but it doesn't seem to carry the same weight as the original. I loved that he brought back Michael Keaton and Michael Gough, and the casting for the film's new villains were well-thought, but the film had a couple flaws that weakened the overall experience in my opinion. In the second adventure, it's Christmas-time in Gotham and the city has been plagued with sightings of a mysterious Pengiun-man from the sewers. The Penguin soon reveals himself to the citizens and, with support from local corrupt businessman Max Shreck, begins a bid for mayor of the city. Meanwhile, Shreck's meek secretary Selina Kyle adopts the persona of Catwoman when a near-death experience spurs her into action to change her life and bring down those who've made her miserable.Just as in the first film, the casting and production design are the greatest parts of the movie. Michael Keaton continues to prove he was a great choice for Bruce Wayne/Batman, though it seems we don't get nearly as much of him in the film this time around. With two villains to explore (three, if you include Shreck), Bruce loses a good deal of screen time to developing the new characters. This is my primary complaint with all comic-based films that attempt to include multiple villains: you spend so much time building up and introducing these new characters that it bogs down the story and it feels uneven. The primary focus of the film is the Penguin and his plot to become mayor (and an additional evil plan involving Gotham's children that he prepares for throughout the movie and watches it fall apart in less than a minute of screen time). Danny DeVito was absolutely perfect as the Penguin and he is what really makes this film enjoyable for me. Michelle Pfeiffer makes a hot Catwoman, but she ends up playing second fiddle to Penguin; still, she's given enough development in her scenes to make a tragic character who's torn between her two lifestyles. Corrupt CEO Max Shreck is played by Christopher Walken, and we all know that man can do no wrong.The film's weaknesses come in the form of the the execution of the story. While BATMAN managed to avoid it for the most part, BATMAN RETURNS jumps right in with a bit of camp I'd hoped we'd left in the past: themed henchmen. Right from the start, we're exposed to Penguin's thugs...the Red Triangle Circus gang. So, to match Penguin's circus sideshow vibe, we have henchmen ranging from the organ grinder with the monkey to the ringmaster. It reeked of the corniness of the 1960's series and put a damper on the noir feeling evoked by the first film. There are also plot holes that I can't help but nitpick each time I watch the movie, such as how Penguin and his crew got ahold of such detailed plans for the Batmobile for their plan to blackmail the hero. And, since I'm on the topic of camp, I found it hard to suspend my belief for the Penguin's final plan (his ""army""). Seriously...did the franchise need to resort to something so corny so soon?Despite it's descent into the camp of the 60s that paved the way for the Schumacher sequels to take it too far, I don't hate this film. I love the characters enough to forgive some plot issues and, while it isn't as strong as the first, it's still a great Batman film. I would've been interested to see where Burton would've wanted to take the series from here but I'm glad he got out before the series too a turn for the worse (BATMAN AND ROBIN, anyone?).",Batman Returns
121,moviewizguy,"The Bat, the Cat, the Penguin",5,3 January 2010,"Batman is pitted against the demented, ravenous Penguin, a pitiful, orphaned psychopathic freak who once went on a baby-killing spree, and a ""power"" hungry capitalist villain Max Shreck. As the two criminals plot to gain domination over Gotham City, Batman must plot to stop them.As the film starts, you can tell the tone will be immensely darker than that of the first. Although darker doesn't necessarily mean better, in this case, it's true....only for a moment. I was never impressed by the first film. It struck me as entirely uninteresting and boring, for the most part. In this film, I was, more or less, interested at whats going on. The first hour was pretty good because there are some great things going on, especially with the new characters introduced.However, it started to go down again. After the hour mark, I found myself disinterested because everything starts getting repetitive all over again. Maybe the only Batman films I'll ever enjoy are Christopher Nolan's reboot and its sequel. This time, the film has mostly everything bigger, with more villains and more action. The action scenes still seem second-rate to me. However, like before, the production design is great. I like the look of Gotham and the costume designs for the three character, Batman, Penguin, and Catwoman, largely thanks to the great Stan Winston.Michael Keaton started to grow on me in this sequel. I found him being more comfortable in his role as the title character. Danny DeVito is almost flawless as the Penguin. You'll probably never see him like that ever again. Michelle Pfeiffer is just great as the sexy Catwoman. And Christopher Walken, well, he was just decent among those actors.Although much darker and interesting at first, the film slowly loses its steam halfway, sputtering to a convoluted mess near the end. I kid you not, there were so many things and threats going on in the end that it was ridiculous! Bigger is certainly not better in this film. Tim Burton, I know you can do better than this.",Batman Returns
122,Gislef,"Like Batman, I'm dichotimatically torn...",6,12 April 1999,"...by Batman Returns.  On the one hand, there's a good story here (Bruce Wayne sympthasizing with both the Penguin and Catwoman, and even Schreck's concern for his son gives him a sympathetic moment or two), an interesting Biblical motif, some good fight sequences which help to maintain the image of Michael Keaton as the Batman, and some generally interesting elements throughout.On the other hand, Keaton seems to think he's in a comedy movie, playing almost all of his Wayne sequences for laughs.  He was blown off the screen by Nicholson's performance in the first movie:  this time around he's blown off the screen by three less-powerful actors/actresses overacting in concert.And _oh_ do they overact.  When Christopher Walken is the most subdued bad guy in any movie, you know you're in trouble.  The Penguin isn't so much Dickensian as disgusting as he eats raw fish, bleeds black, and bites off noses.  Pfeiffer goes too overly humorous as Kyle, too overly aggressive as Catwoman.  These are the comic book characters reinterpreted and stripped down to their _very_ basic elements.  I don't mind that they're different from their comic book counterparts, but they're (ironically) much more two-dimensional than their four-color equivalents.Meanwhile, with Keaton struggling against his overacting villainous counterparts, everyone else gets short shrift.  Michael Gough is the only other character to remain at all noticeable.  Gordon and Chip Schreck are mildly memorable, but can you really picture anyone else in this movie a day after you've watched it (except for SNL actress Jan Hooks, and maybe the memorably icy Poodle Lady)?  There's really just too much going on here, ending with a big penguin missle-launching blowout.The second in the franchise, BR remains somewhat entertaining.  But it's big, flashy throw-everything-we've-got-and-hope-it- sticks approach is a predecessor to the Schumacher ""epics"" that are to come.",Batman Returns
123,mike48128,Catwoman Begins and Steals Batman's Heart,7,26 October 2013,"Perhaps the darkest of the 4 Batman movies (in this series). There is much to like and dislike here. Michelle Pfeiffer is ""purr-fect"" as Catwoman and owns this movie. Too bad it isn't more about her and less about The Penguin. Danny DeVito plays a nasty, mean-spirited bird, and while the character is well-executed, it drags down the film to an almost depressing level. Curiously, in this one, no one goes to a cell in Arkham Asylum. Not enough gadgets in this one, although the penguins, which are both very real and clever fabrications, are very well-done. If this didn't win something for special effects, it should have. Max Shreck (Walken) is a weak co-villain, but, as always, he plays his part very well as the evil-greedy Capitalist. More grim and graphic than the last two Batman movies (in this series). Children were seen crying, leaving the theater. I wish the film had been more about Batman and Catwoman, don't you? They need to use her in further adventures. (That Halle Berry Catwoman movie was a big disappointment.) I nominate Scarlet Johannson for the role. Catwoman, of course, does not die, even though she was shot several times. Why is that? Nine lives?",Batman Returns

125,mjw2305,superb Second Movie,8,16 January 2005,"I was glad to see that Tim Burton again captured the essence of the comic books.This time Batman (still Keaton i'm glad to say) has two bad guys to contend with, the penguin (DeVito) played to perfection and of course the stunning Michelle Pffiefer as catwoman. Both original arch enemies of the Bat and both played brilliantly with sufficient background to their origin.Another successful outing for the Bat, shame it went down hill from here on in.8/10",Batman Returns
126,sme_no_densetsu,A decent follow-up but no match for the first movie,7,6 May 2017,"""Batman Returns"" brought Tim Burton back to the Batman franchise after 1989's incredibly successful first outing. The movie proved to be a financial success but opinion is divided on whether or not the movie lived up to its now iconic predecessor.This time around, Batman (Michael Keaton) faces off against a pair of his longtime nemeses - the Penguin (Danny DeVito) and Catwoman (Michelle Pfeiffer). Plot-wise, the Penguin teams up with a corrupt businessman (Christopher Walken) in order to essentially take control of Gotham City. Catwoman, meanwhile, has her own reasons for getting in on the action.I find that ""Batman Returns"" has a more pronounced Tim Burton feel than ""Batman"", which isn't surprising considering that he was given more creative control. Whether that's a good or a bad thing for the movie is subject to debate. Personally, I find that this is where the franchise started gravitating towards the cartoonish aspects of the character's universe, which would only get worse with the poorly regarded third & fourth films.The cast is pretty decent but it's tough to fill the hole left by Jack Nicholson. Nevertheless, Danny DeVito is effective as the Penguin and Michelle Pfeiffer is alluring as the leather-clad Catwoman. Christoper Walken, meanwhile, supplies a typically Christopher Walken-esque performance as only he can. Unfortunately, one of the drawbacks of introducing all of these characters is that Batman himself is noticeably absent for most of the beginning of the movie.Burton's direction is solid as always but the visuals just seem to lack something in comparison to the first film. Perhaps it's the Christmas setting or maybe it's just that the production design in general isn't as ominous. At least they were able to get Danny Elfman back to handle the music again.Ultimately, I think that ""Batman Returns"" is a decent follow-up but no match for the first movie. Saying that it's better than ""Batman Forever"" and ""Batman & Robin"" doesn't count for much but I would say that it's a reasonably entertaining superhero movie, all things considered. It's just that, with the glut of superhero movies in recent years, it's no longer particularly remarkable.",Batman Returns
127,Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187,I get why people have mixed feelings about this movie; and I stand by those who love it.,8,10 May 2018,"Batman Returns is one of the edgiest mainstream 90s blockbusters you'll EVER see. It's got so much edge that the film was unsuitable for McDonald's planned Happy Meal tie-in promotions for the movie so they cancelled those plans. So how does this film compare to the multitude of Batman films after this one came out? Pretty good I'd say. Even against Nolan's Dark Knight Trilogy it's still a solid movie in itself. Where Nolan got the crime and neo-noir aspects of Batman down-pat, Burton accomplished for the Gothic overtones present in a lot of the classic Batman stories.Batman Returns is not exactly a feel-good superhero film: its villain, Oswald Cobblepot, is a misfit who was thrown into a river left to die (by his parents), and Selina Kyle turns regular woman into crime-fighting-and-committing vigilante by night. And Batman is still that same tormented orphan we've all come to know and love through the years.Batman Returns is a dark Batman story but its Gothic imagery compliments the story and direction, even if the style sometimes out-performs the story to some extent. Flawed but good I'd say. 4/5 stars.",Batman Returns
128,pyrocitor,"The Bat is back, and better than ever",9,2 September 2006,"After 1989 boasted the legendary Dark Knight's triumphant explosion onto movie screens worldwide, a sequel to the smash hit seemed destined to occur. Thus, 1992 heralded the return of both quirky director Tim Burton and actor Michael Keaton stepping into the batsuit once again. However, unlike most sequels which generally at best equal the quality of their predecessor, usually falling terribly short of the mark, Burton's ""Returns"" vastly surpasses the original in almost every possible shape and form. While an entertaining film, the first Batman was deeply flawed, a large portion of which was the film was mainly diverted towards showcasing Jack Nicholson's inspired, show stealing performance as homicidal clown prince of crime The Joker. Nicholson's performance was a triumph, but the downside being that because he was shown so often, viewers got almost no time to get to know Keaton's oddball millionaire and edgy crimefighter title character. Burton rectifies this mistake by diverting much more of the focus of his sequel towards Batman himself, while still churning up a fascinating new cauldron of villains and action setpieces. Once again, Burton's wonderfully creative Gothic design comes to play, but ""Returns"" shows perhaps his most beautiful scenery yet. The idea for the story to take place at Christmastime was novel, as Burton has several beautifully affecting shots of characters seen through slowly floating snowflakes. The single most affecting shot is the title sequence shot of the baby Penguin's carriage slowly drifting down the snowy river into the sewers, accompanied by Danny Elfman's simply wonderful score, arguably his best to date, save perhaps the Spider-Man films. Batman Returns, as well as being supremely entertaining is also a surprisingly beautiful and moodily shot movie. But Burton also improves on his prior film in other aspects - namely the action sequences have been amped up considerably, and Batman actually does some fighting, unlike the first where it looked like poor Keaton could barely move in the suit. The absence of Prince songs on the soundtrack is... liberating to say the least, namely because it makes more room for Elfman's majestic score, and... honestly, Prince and Batman do not, and should never have mixed. The script also has more memorable and well crafted lines this time round, save those given to Nicholson's Joker, even if the storyline does seem a bit uneven at times (The Penguin seems to be radically altering his master plan about every five minutes, which gets a bit disjointing). The primary cast is nothing less than spectacular, with Keaton giving a much stronger rendition of both his oddball quirky recluse Bruce Wayne, and much more stylish and classy while under the cape and cowl. It's quite a mercy he is given more screen time this time round, as we feel we finally get to know the man behind the mask a bit this time. Danny DeVito makes a terrifying, disturbing and pitiful Penguin, as well as the character and all his foils likely could have been played. Michelle Pfeiffer easily steals the show and creates an iconic femme fatale character as the mysteriously seductive Catwoman. Pfeiffer is nothing less than flat out gorgeous, and her oozing charisma and sexuality is enough to make any man ""me-ow"". Christopher Walken also has a wonderful appearance as corrupt businessman Max Shreck, as always, getting some of the most memorable lines in the film (""Bruce Wayne?! Why are you dressed up like Batman?!""). Michael Gough as usual IS Alfred, and there's nothing else to be said. Altogether, Burton has rounded together a picturesque, (apart from Pfeiffer as well...) beautiful and very entertaining follow up to his first Batman adventure, with a superb rogues gallery and some much needed time to get to know the said man behind the mask. The story may be somewhat disjointed, and not terribly realistic, but it's a comic book movie - realism is seldom an element present. Any fans of the Dark Knight or Burton's eccentric creativity, ""Batman Returns"" should be considered a must view. -9/10",Batman Returns
129,BrandtSponseller,Sheer force of style largely transcends the flaws,9,20 May 2005,"I really wanted to be able to give this film a 10. I've long thought it was my favorite of the four modern live-action Batman films to date (and maybe it still will be--I have yet to watch the Schumacher films again). I'm also starting to become concerned about whether I'm somehow subconsciously being contrarian. You see, I always liked the Schumacher films. As far as I can remember, they were either 9s or 10s to me. But the conventional wisdom is that the two Tim Burton directed films are far superior. I had serious problems with the first Burton Batman this time around--I ended up giving it a 7--and apologize as I might, I just couldn't help feel that Batman Returns just has too many small direction, plot and script problems scattered throughout to justify a 10.But Burton _almost_ trumps the problems with sheer force of style, and even though there are a lot of small flaws, Batman Returns is still a great film, especially if you're a Burton fan, as Batman Returns has just as much in common with The Nightmare Before Christmas (1993) and Edward Scissorhands (1990) as it does with anything else in the Batman universe.The film begins strongly, with the Cobblepots having a baby. We see their dismay--people walk out of the birthing room with horror on their faces, ready to vomit. Later, they have the baby in a small cage. Finally they take it out for an evening stroll and dump it in the Gotham City River. The baby ends up becoming Batman villain The Penguin (Danny DeVito).Meanwhile, Max Shreck (Christopher Walken) is the film's ""evil capitalist"", comparable to Grissom (Jack Palance) in Batman. He is planning on duping Gotham City in various ways, and we see him emotionally abusing his secretary, the timid Selina Kyle (Michelle Pfeiffer). When Kyle discovers one of the nefarious plots, Grissom tries to get rid of her, but she is rescued by cats, becoming Catwoman.While all of this is going on, The Penguin, who has long been only rumored to exist and who is thought to be dangerous, begins a scheme to be presented to the public as a good guy, despite having less than benevolent, ulterior motives.Before re-watching Burton's Batman films this time, I didn't remember just how little the films are about Batman (Michael Keaton). It's almost as if Burton didn't feel the character was interesting enough to focus on. The focus here is much more on the villains, especially The Penguin. Batman doesn't appear very often, especially in the beginning of the film, and surprisingly often, we're watching him watching The Penguin.Although some viewers necessarily count the above as a flaw, I can't say that I do, even if I'd like to know more about Batman and follow his story more. The villains' stories are interesting, too, and as an ""origin story"" for two major Batman villains, Batman Returns is already more than complex in terms of plot.However, there are some character problems that I do count as a flaw. The Penguin has a cadre of circus performers who do his bidding, but even though they're frequently on screen, we never get to learn anything about them. Burton has a core of characters as intriguing as those in Tod Browning's Freaks (1932) available, with actors as interesting as Vincent Schiavelli, but he just doesn't have the space to use them.For that matter, he hardly has space to explore Catwoman. The film plays as if Catwoman may have been as developed and featured in as many scenes as The Penguin, but that cut of the film would have been 4 hours long. So the bulk of the Catwoman scenes had to be excised. Of course, all of this barely leaves any room for Batman. Burton has Batman turn very dark in the public's eye in this film, and unusually, he never bothers to resolve this. As far as we know, at the end, Gothamites still think that Batman is a murdering lunatic. That's an interesting development, but unfortunately it ended up being dropped between this film and the next.As for the script, although there are minor problems including some non-sequiturs and bizarre decisions (in terms of logic) made by characters, it's clear that Burton and writers Sam Hamm and Daniel Waters are not exactly trying to tell a traditional story. A lot of the dialogue is pun-oriented, but often this is fairly subtle and/or complex (of course, sometimes it is very blatant or transparent, too). It helps to look at Batman Returns as a more ""poetic"" film, as I believe was the intention. This also carries over into more general plot and directorial decisions--plenty of odd character actions, including from minor characters, are done in service of a general mood or style, and that style works very well.""Dark"" is the easiest way to sum up Batman Returns in a word, and whether that's a positive or negative depends on your disposition. Anyone who knows me knows that I love dark. So for me, Burton's style largely transcends the flaws in the plot and the script. In many ways, Batman Returns is like an insane, campy horror film, with beautifully eerie production design. Like Batman, Burton is still making many references to other films, but instead of Vertigo (1958) and Star Wars (1977) (well, there's still a slight Star Wars reference), he invokes films like Nosferatu (1922) (including that ""Max Schreck"" was the name of the actor who played the Dracula-like character there), Motel Hell (1980), the aforementioned Freaks, Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory (1971) (which has a surreal, dark edge to it) and zombie films--made most explicit in The Penguin's final scene.In terms of visuals and general atmosphere--and that includes the general ""feel"" of the story, the characters and so on--this couldn't be a stronger 10.",Batman Returns
130,Sirus_the_Virus,A better sequel than you could've imagined.,8,25 August 2009,"Batman Returns is a film that definitely disturbed some people. You know why that probably is? Because of The menacing Penguin, who is just disgusting to look at. Batman Returns is more of what a Tim Burton film should look like. The film is creepy, dark, and disturbing and gross at times. Now i'm not saying that the original film was bad, but it had it's flaws. It lacked the excitement, Jack Nicholson didn't seem that evil, and it was occasionally boring. Batman Returns is exciting, both Michelle Pheifer and Danny Devito are great as villains, and it's not boring. There are no flashbacks ion this film. That's because we know what happened to him. We know enough about the guy in the bat costume. We learn more about the Penguin than Batman in this film. From the minute Batman Returns starts you'll be creeped out. After seeing this film, my thoughts on Penguins changed a lot. Batman Returns is a better sequel with a better cast. Including:Michael Keaton(You know what he's been in)Danny Devito(It's alway sunny in Philadelphia)Michelle Pheifer(Wolf, The Fabulous Baker Boys)Christopher Walken(Click, Mousehunt)I will come out and say this now. Michelle Pheifer looked hot in that leather outfit. There's something about women in leather outfits that make me watch a movie. Sometimes. Like the Underworld films, Kate Beckinsale looks good, as usual. But i'll see anything with Kate Beckinsale anyways. Danny Devito is disgusting and menacing as The Penguin. A lot has improved on Batman Returns. I didn't love the film, but it's definitely a good entry.The Plot: Batman returns yet again and this time he must face the menacing and horrifying Penguin.

132,baumer,This movie sucks! I mean really sucks!!,1,22 June 1999,"I have really never seen a film that is worse than this.  There is one improbable situation after another and nothing is thought out to make any sense.  It looked to me like the makers of this film figured that they had a gold mine on their hands and because the first made a ton of money, they could make a quickie film that has no concern for detail, plot, characterization, direction, script, stunts or anything that makes a film entertaining.The film looks like it was filmed on a sound stage and you can tell because when it is supposed to be below zero outside, there is no mist coming from the breath of the people in the scene.  And that is only one small complaint.  The biggest one is that this film suffers from what I like to call the respected man is suddenly a bad guy syndrome.Batman is a respected, hard working, guardian angel in Gotham City.  He has been like that for a while now.  Suddenly a shady figure that is grotesque looking and walks like a Penguin enters the picture.  Within days of his arrival on the scene, not only has the penguin miraculously discredited Batman but he has managed to get the entire city against him.  He has been ostracized from public safety and this leaves the Penguin alone to do his diabolical plans.Is this the best they can come up with?  I mean, aren't writers smarter than that?  Can't they write a better way for the Penguin to do what he does? I really hate this movie.  With all that I am, I hate it.  But it made a ton of money because kids love this crap and for the rest of us that want to see a good film and hope to God that this film will be a welcome distraction for two hours of our summer, are not only disappointed, we are disgusted.

133,blott2319-1,"Campy and weird, just like Schumacher",3,6 August 2021,"I should probably preface this and any other Batman review I make by saying the blasphemous truth, I think Batman is the most overrated superhero in existence. He's like Hawkeye with a utility belt instead of a bow and arrow, but he's praised as being better than Superman by most of the free world. So I'm not exactly starting at a place of adoration whenever I approach a Batman movie. However, that should be OK with Batman Returns since the Caped Crusader isn't in massive chunks of this movie. He pops in on occasion to foil the villains' plans, but otherwise isn't really the star of this film despite the fact that his name is in the title. This is the Catwoman and Penguin movie, but that probably wouldn't have put as many butts in the seats as ""Batman.""For those who like this kind of over-the-top campy comic book movie, I can see how Batman Returns would work. The dialogue is cheesy and full of puns, the performances are goofy, and the storyline is ridiculous. What I can't understand is the fact that people will praise this movie while criticizing the films that Joel Schumacher made to follow it up. This feels almost identical to those movies in tone and characterization. OK, I'll grant that Batman & Robin probably went a bit too far into the nonsensical stuff, but certainly Batman Forever is on par with Batman Returns in every way. This movie is goofy and weird, and doesn't really fit all that well with the original Batman movie which actually felt like it was taking things seriously from time to time.What I find most unpleasant in Batman Returns is the Penguin of it all. The Penguin in general is a disgusting character in this film, and they push it way too far in the gross-out direction. This is also the first time I can remember Tim Burton allowing the deformed, abused, and mistreated character to be the villain. Catwoman is a silly character, but she works fine for this movie. Her origin story is ridiculous, and her literal nine lives seems a bit crazy, but within the context of this film it isn't all that off-putting. I didn't take any issues with her, other than the fact that I couldn't really figure out why she was fighting against Batman. In general, this movie seemed to be created from a messy script. People's motivations are muddy and confused, and Penguin's plans seem to be ever changing. From start to finish, all I can see in Batman Returns are flaws, and that left me annoyed and completely underwhelmed.",Batman Returns
134,gizmomogwai,"I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo: my favourite Batman movie",9,7 May 2010,"With his sequel to the hit movie Batman (1989), Tim Burton is given more creative control over his project and it really shows. Batman Returns explores common themes of Burton's, and it rivals Edward Scissorhands as being his best work. It makes changes to the Batman legend but not as severe as has been alleged.Visually this movie is masterful. The movie is surreal: it's like a nightmare vision. But there's actually usually overlooked substance in addition to style. The central theme of this movie is being a freak or an outcast. The Penguin at one point struggles with Batman, accusing him of being jealous because Penguin is odd physically as well as mentally. Bruce Wayne and Selina Kyle also sit on a couch and talk about being strange, with Selina making a true but odd statement that sickos are committed. In this movie, two freaks find each other and discover they can feel a connection with another person. The movie goes on to argue that when you find out that you're a creep, you can go either way- you can fight for what's right or give into anger, hatred and a drive for revenge.Being pushed around can make you a monster: it happened to Penguin who was dropped into a sewer and to Catwoman who was thrown out a window. But giving into darkness will destroy you- the Penguin at the end pushes the button to set off his missiles, and this destroys his whole world. Meanwhile, Catwoman misses out on her happy ending. The only character in the movie who appears to be truly evil is the businessman Max Shreck, who manipulates and abuses- and when you do that, one day you may just face the consequences. Shreck gets fried.The movie is packed with quotable dialogue: ""Ah, the direct approach. I admire that in a man with a mask."" ""How can you be so mean to someone so meaningless?"" One of my favourite quips is from a security guard who says he doesn't know whether to open fire or fall in love. There's much twisted humour to enjoy.The music, too, helps make this movie great. This includes the tragic music that plays at the ending, and sexy, mysterious music for Catwoman. A song that plays at the dance and over the end credits also fits Catwoman, being dark and sexy.I know Batman fans were disappointed in that the caped crusader kills a couple goons; the character is today expected to have a no-killing rule, although he didn't in the first Batman comics. Still, note Batman doesn't kill except when in combat- when you have captured an enemy (Shreck at the end), killing becomes unnecessary and dangerous, a mere act of revenge. Also said fans may not like the Penguin being a freak in the sewer- but he *is* still a crime boss who works in secret while trying to join higher society (in this case by running for mayor); he still retains his love of birds and umbrellas.This is with apologies to Christopher Nolan, but Batman Returns remains my favourite Batman movie. I don't hate Nolan for not being Burton- on the contrary, I enjoyed Batman Begins and The Dark Knight and thought they surpassed Batman '89. But Batman Returns is an entirely different creature- it captures the anguish and glories of the modern freak. It's a tragedy masked as a superhero movie, unique and beautiful.",Batman Returns
135,emasterslake,As cool as the first one & Tim Burton's first sequel!,8,18 April 2006,"This is a sequel to the successful BatMan movie of 1989. It's still directed by Tim Burton, and Micheal Keaton is still BatMan.In this one a new villain is about to crawl from the sewers with a plan to take over Gotham City. He's a freak of nature, a short guy with the instincts of a penguin. And that's what name he goes by ""Pennguin"". He was abandon by his parents due to his appearance and the only family he has are the penguins and ex-circus performers. The Pennguin attempts to become mayor by making Gotham believe he is a trust worthy gentleman who just wants to finds out who who parents were and what his name is. Will this bird guy get what he wants? Not only that but BatMan also has another problem to deal with. Another new villain has made her appearance in the crime wave and justice system of Gotham. Her name is CatWoman who is a woman with the instincts of a cat. It's undetermined whether she's friend or foe.With 2 psychopathic characters running around Gotham. It'll be interesting on how BatMan will be able to restore peace to the city.This sequel is as great as the first one. Danny DeVito is excellent as the Pennguin and Mechille Phipper is great as CatWoman. And I highly recommend it to the Micheal Keaton/Tim Burton/BatMan/Danny Devito Fans.",Batman Returns
136,hnt_dnl,A real classic!,10,3 March 2008,"I remember really liking BATMAN RETURNS when it came out in 1992, but now I think that this is the best of all the Batman movies (even over Christopher Nolan's terrific Batman Begins and definitely over the seriously over-hyped overrated The Dark Knight). I originally remember thinking that the first big Batman movie starring Jack Nicholson and Michael Keaton was the best and it still holds up in many ways, while not in others. But I think that this sequel Returns really nails it. For one, the 4 main characters are all vivid and memorable. You really get to see what Batman/Bruce Wayne is all about in Keaton's terrific characterization. Keaton is the best Batman, not Kilmer, Clooney, or even the up-and-coming Bale, who was exceptional in Begins and could have stolen top honors from Keaton had his character not been destroyed by Nolan's hack film-making in TDK.Danny DeVito as The Penguin is disturbing, scary, hilarious, and lethal. DeVito is great and doesn't need scenery-chewing to give great performance like Nicholson's Joker. The viewer can actually sympathize with this disfigured outcast and his plight to fit into normal society. I had never really been big fan of Michelle Pfeiffer until this film, but this is definitely my favorite performance of hers. Pfeiffer's Selina Kyle starts off very odd and goofy, then once transformed into Catwoman becomes simultaneously sexy and scary. Also, I feel that Keaton and Pfeiffer in Returns have more chemistry than Keaton and Basinger in Batman. And Christopher Walken as Max Shreck is, well, as always, Christopher Walken!Returns is more layered and focused than it's predecessor, which much of the time has that ""Hollywood"" feel to it. The sequel is assured film-making from beginning to end. The way Burton and introduces the Penguin's heartbreaking backstory accompanied by Danny Elfman's tragic score in that brilliant 5-minute opening sequence pulled me in immediately. Now, virtually all films start out with openings like this, but in 1992, this was definitely more the exception instead of the rule.Flash forward 33 years to the present day Gotham and we are introduced to powerful businessman Shreck who wants to build new power plant in Gotham. During same scene we meet Shreck's meek, bullied secretary Selina Kyle. Soon after, we get treated to the film's first action sequence as Batman must battle The Penguin's Red Triangle Gang, a funny yet lethal group of outcasts and circus performers. Penguin sets plan in motion to attack the Gotham Christmas celebration, kidnap Shreck in the chaos, and force him to help introduce him to society. Meanwhile, Selina discovers Shreck's criminal plans and so he ""kills"" her by shoving her out his high-rise office, then she is revived by cats. Even though some of this sounds convoluted, somehow it works within Burton's twisted, macabre Gotham universe: a dark, noirish world comprised of mistreated, deformed outcasts who deep down only want acceptance and to fit in. Very confident storytelling.The action scenes are few and far in between, but they are all exciting, entertaining, and nail-biting. They aren't there just for show, the way some in the original are. And they all make sense. The climactic scene with Penguin army marching into the center of Gotham with Batman zoning in on Penguin's hideout and sidekick butler Alfred (Michael Gough in a welcome return from the original) is probably my favorite final showdown from any Batman film.The Christmas time, wintry setting adds to the dark, cold, lonely feel of Burton's Batman world. In this sequel, Burton continues to introduce more of Batman ""wonderful toys"" and does it very cleverly. And although dark, Returns still has a ton of humor. DeVito in particular is hilarious with his memorable one-liners. Walken plays Shreck with a sly disdain for common people. And the Batman-Catwoman exchanges are extremely stimulating and humorous as evidenced by Keaton and Pfeiffer's in sync chemistry. The best ensemble in any Batman movie. Batman Returns is easily one of Tim Burton's top films.",Batman Returns
137,hall895,The Too Dark Knight,4,4 October 2011,"Tim Burton's first Batman film was widely praised, largely for its serious tone. Serious by comic book movie standards anyway. There was darkness and gloominess in that first film which Burton used to great effect. In Batman Returns Burton upped the ante on the darkness. He went really dark. I mean really, really dark. Way too dark for his movie's good. One can imagine thousands of happy young tykes bouncing into the theater excited to see a Batman movie only to come out two hours later crying their eyes out and headed for an appointment with a child psychologist. Fun for the whole family? Not this movie. This is more horror film than superhero saga. I guess when a movie begins with parents tossing their infant child into a river you can forget about it being a feel-good story. And when that child floats into a sewer and is rescued by penguins we know who our villain's going to be this time around.So it's Penguin. And Burton's concept for this character sinks the movie. What a vile, disgusting creature. A sick, twisted, perverted little man whose diabolical plans, when finally revealed, are almost too awful to comprehend. It's the stuff of nightmares. If Burton was looking to frighten a whole generation of kids he probably succeeded. If he was looking to make a good movie he failed. The Penguin is a depraved character who makes the movie way scarier than any mass-audience comic book movie should be. And aside from the scares parents will probably want to be covering their children's eyes and ears with all the upfront sexual innuendo in the movie. ""Mommy, what's poontang?"" This is a Batman movie for crying out loud, you know kids are going to swarm to see it. But Burton made a movie with very grownup sensibilities. OK, so maybe it's too adult, maybe it's not what you really expect a Batman movie to be. But putting that aside there's still the fact that it's simply a bad movie.You feel bad for Danny DeVito who, in playing Penguin, was given a character who wasn't salvageable. Penguin's not the only villain though. There are a couple more and they largely fail too. Michelle Pfeiffer plays Selina Kyle who is of course destined to become Catwoman. How exactly does Selina become Catwoman? Quite ludicrously. Pfeiffer makes the most of what she's got to work with. Catwoman's got her moments which is more than you can say for Penguin who is an off-putting, grotesque abomination from start to finish. Then there's powerful, corrupt Gotham businessman Max Shreck. The best thing that you can say about this character is that he's played by Christopher Walken, who always brings his own unique touch to any film. But Shreck's not particularly interesting, has no backstory to give us a reason to care about him, and he disappears for large portions of the film. Three villains in this case don't add up to much. And oh by the way Michael Keaton's Batman again. Keaton was largely overshadowed by Jack Nicholson's Joker in the first film. But, both as Batman and perhaps more crucially as Bruce Wayne, Keaton contributed a great deal to the first film. Here he really doesn't get a chance to do much of anything at all. Neither Batman nor Bruce ever are really able to grab hold of this movie. It's a dark, gloomy tale of the bad guys, the Penguin in particular. And where Nicholson's Joker infused the first film with so much energy the Penguin sucks the life out of this film. There's very little to enjoy here. Is it so much to ask to have a little fun in a comic book movie? No fun here, just gloom and doom and a movie which really disappoints.",Batman Returns
138,Beta_Gallinger,"Danny DeVito and Michelle Pfeiffer can't match Jack Nicholson as villains, but this sequel is still almost as good as the original",8,18 March 2010,"This is the first sequel in the modern Batman movie franchise, released three years after the original film and directed by the same filmmaker, Tim Burton. I was still way too young for PG-13 rated movies by the time ""Batman Returns"" came into theatres in the early 90's, and I saw it for the first time over a decade later, in the fall of 2005. It was the first Batman film I ever watched. I first saw the 1989 blockbuster very shortly after that. I was very impressed with this sequel the first time, and have seen both of Tim Burton's contributions to the franchise again more than once since first seeing them more than four years ago. This sequel is not as popular as its predecessor, and may be slightly inferior, but neither film has ever failed to impress me.Christmas is coming, but Gotham City is headed for more trouble this holiday season. The Penguin is a man who was born disfigured 33 years ago and sent into the sewer at Christmas time, where he was found by penguins. He still lives down in the sewer, and during a gathering in the city, he sends a group of minions to disrupt it. Batman is called upon to fight them off, but just after he does, Penguin forces a corrupt businessman named Max Shreck into the sewer and convinces him to help the deformed man gain the respect of the people of Gotham City. After this, it isn't long before Shreck's secretary, the hapless Selina Kyle, discovers the businessman's criminal secret plan, so he pushes her out the window! On the ground below, she appears to be dead, but a group of cats quickly come and revive her! Selina then returns to her apartment, where she soon develops an evil alter ego named Catwoman, another threat to the city! Penguin and Catwoman are both intent on discrediting Batman! One of the highlights of 1989's ""Batman"" is Jack Nicholson's charismatic and comical performance as the Joker. Two other famous Batman villains from the comic books, Penguin and Catwoman, are featured in this first sequel, and are played here by Danny DeVito and Michelle Pfeiffer respectively. Unfortunately, neither of these cast members' performances can match that of Nicholson in the first film. DeVito can be mildly amusing in the role of a demented madman, but certainly not as funny as Nicholson playing the same kind of role before him. Also, Pfeiffer has some weak lines here, such as, ""Honey, I'm home. Oh, I forgot. I'm not married,"" and some things she says as Catwoman. However, these two are pretty good for the most part, and Michael Keaton is still impressive as Bruce Wayne/Batman. ""Batman Returns"" features the same fantastic Tim Burton-style visuals as the first film (this time with snow), and also features lots of action and suspense, just like its predecessor. There may be more flaws in the script here, with such scenes as the one in which Catwoman seems to make Batman forget why he's fighting her just by saying, ""How could you? I'm a woman,"" but the film is so entertaining that this is definitely not a significant problem.This first ""Batman"" sequel is not a perfect film, and like most sequels, it's probably not quite as good as the original, but it's still another very entertaining superhero action movie, unlike what followed it in the franchise when Joel Schumacher took over and made ""Batman Forever"" and ""Batman & Robin""! I feel I could rate ""Batman Returns"" 9/10, the same rating I gave to its predecessor, instead of 8. While it doesn't have as much good comic relief as the dark 1989 release, I think it has about as much excitement, plus the same dark visuals and atmosphere. Tim Burton only directed two Batman movies, but they are both very good ones, and his directing ability and visual style definitely helped. Just like the original, this 1992 sequel is not for little kids, even though it is Batman, but for those who like these comic book adaptations and are old enough for PG-13 rated movies, both films could easily be worthwhile.",Batman Returns
139,vip_ebriega,It's better than the first in many ways. A visual masterpiece.,10,29 September 2007,"My Take: Definitely the best of the original BATMAN movies.The first BATMAN, although not entirely a perfect film, manages to capture the real atmosphere and dark-comic tradition, much missed in the campy 1960's TV series with Adam West. BATMAN RETURNS continues that tradition, being even more darker than the first. The film was heavily criticized for this, but I hardly see the reason why. It comes to show how creative this film is. It's better than the first film in many ways. A visual masterpiece, no doubt about it, and one of the better comic-book adaptations out there, perhaps since SUPERMAN in 1978.Director Tim Burton, who also directed the first film, gives twice as much creativity to this sequel. Coping, as well, to a more bizarre and oftentimes deeper plot. The film opens with a mean-spirited one, showing a wealthy couple throwing their deformed child to the sewer on a Christmas night, while we follow the cradle floating down the deep sewer and found by a group of penguins who take refuge there. This scene will definitely scare the kids a bit. More will they get scared when they actually meet The Penguin (Danny DeVito). The terrific (or is that terrifying) make-up by Stan Winston is sure to give nightmares.Besides The Penguin, we also have Catwoman (played voluptuously by Michelle Pfieffer), whose origin is yet another scene I wouldn't recommend you let the kids too see. Pfieffer, indeed, is a terrific femme fatale. Christopher Walken provides a convincing, yet not much used, villain as Max Schrek, Gotham's biggest tycoon who plans to create a power plant, which has a drawback that would drain the city's power.The film, while the first had writers Sam Hamm and Warren Skaaren, has a new writer, Daniel Waters. Waters gives the film a more deeper story, which highlights, this time, more on the villains. Whereas the first film focused on Bruce Wayne's reflection on the death of his parents, this time, it focused on The Penguin, yearning to find his parents, and find out why they hated him badly. Rarely has there been a film that, as well, focuses on the back story of the bad guys. Even more less on superhero movies, but BATMAN RETURNS gives us that unique quality.But the great story isn't the only great thing about the film, we also get Burton's great direction. He gives the film both it's deep, dark tradition, as well as his dose of the bizarre and the weird. Danny Elfman's music is terrific, a cross between a superhero film and a dark gloomy film. Stefan Szapsky's photography works as well. It gives the film the film noir-ish atmosphere.At the ending of the first BATMAN, I had a good time, but got the feeling that I could have gotten more. But as the credits rolled in BATMAN RETURNS, it had me gutless and panting, because I got more than I expected, for a sequel.In the end, BATMAN RETURNS does its job, and does it well. It's not a film that I would recommend young kids too see, even if it's a film that usually appeals to them. But anyone above the age of any kid will enjoy this dark and impressive comic book movie.

142,Stampsfightclub,Visually stunning but political edge takes shine off entertainment,6,7 January 2009,"The Penguin (De Vito) steps into the role as Mayor of Gotham City and trouble ensues for Batman (Keaton) through the opinionated Catwoman.In the sequel to Batman, Tim Burton returns to direct another visionary action fantasy that is interesting but poor when looking at modern Batman releases.Has Tim Burton ever failed when delivering darkness to a tale? No. If you take a minute to recall the dark mind of Sweeney Todd or the musical mischief of Jack Skellington then you know just how dark the director's mind can be and with this picture you would expect to see more dark imagery and imagination, especially considering the amount in the first Batman and in the comic books. And such is the beautiful darkness that the opening scenes bring back memories of his other flicks, particularly Edward Scissorhands. As powerful and creative as Burton is once again (will the man ever let us down?) he is unable to do anything about a poorly scripted plot.The bizarre opening looks as though it will be Burton magic again with Elfman's music juxtaposed with a floating basket in a dark river but what follows is a strange string of events involving a man's quest to find out who his parents were, a man hating cat loving woman and a ridiculous lack of superhero usage.The Penguin, though visually brilliant, is an awkward segment of this narrative. This child in a man's body feels very misplaced in the political side of the world. Running for mayor, finding parents and blackmail is all too much and though De Vito was excellent in many turns, there is simply too much for the character at once to be considered remotely believable.Catwoman on the other hand makes things interesting. Not only does Pfeiffer look the part she embodies the slowly suffocating soul of the protagonist. The strong opinionated woman is a fine addition to the film and is the highlight. Male viewers in particular will love her domineering actions and sequences.The political ideologies are too risky and take the attention of the characters. Perhaps the film is trying to preach but with an unbalanced script with action and talking mismatched its hard to tell whether the film has a message or is there for entertainment.This political edge takes the shine of the engaging action sequences and almost overshadows the action. Batman is even left out for the first half an hour because of the political debates which frankly, ruins it all together.",Batman Returns
143,Mister-6,"Of bats, men and sequels....",3,24 June 2000,"I can see what Tim Burton was trying to do with ""Batman Returns"".In the original, there was darkness enough but also a bit too much of the flip attitude of the TV series for his taste.  After all, we're talking about artistic integrity here.  Once and for all, he wanted to make his OWN interpretation of the ""Batman"" mystique, which he did here.Point of order - this movie is indeed successful in showing how good a craftsman Burton is for dark, gloomy images of despair, misgivings and doom. But, is that the right attitude for a movie about a super hero to strike?In a gloomy, seemingly refrigerated Gotham City, Batman must battle the evil of not only The Penguin (DeVito) and Catwoman (Pfeiffer) but also of businessman Max Schreck (Walken) who plans to drain all of Gotham's energy for his own power plant, along with a few other twisted deeds he has hidden up his tailor-made sleeves.BUT, and this is the important part, the first movie had a successful villain in Nicholson's Joker (as if there were any doubt).  Here, the villains are seen more as objects of pity (the deformed, pathetic Penguin; the put-upon, mentally abused Catwoman; the power-hungry, grasping and son (Bryniarski)-obsessed Schreck) than of anything inherently evil. 
And then there's Batman - as portrayed by Keaton, he feels more like a cypher - an empty suit, if you will - than he was in the first film.  He doesn't even give a flicker of the torment he felt in the original.  Here, he just broods.  As before, the scenery is beautiful, if more dark.  Burton is, first and foremost, an artist and shows his talents in composition and design.  But even though the first ""Batman"" was far more successful, it had less to do with Burton and more to do with the calibre of other talent involved (Nicholson, Basinger, Wuhl).Devito plays a one-note villain without any nuance or subtlety; Pfeiffer makes a suitably flaky Catwoman and, even though she tries, her character is far too pitiable to be threatening' Walken basically plays his umpteenth baddie but still pales in comparison to similar parts he's played in ""True Romance"",   and ""A View to a Kill"" (sure, it wasn't very good, but it was still better than THIS!).This series would have to wait to improve (""Batman Forever""), but as far as sequels go, it at least kept with Burton's vision, even if it didn't keep with the entertainment value.Three stars for ""Batman Returns"".  TIDBIT - Reubens and Salinger, who played the parents to DeVito's character, were featured in an earlier Burton effort - ""Pee-Wee's Big Adventure"".  Talk about a token gesture....",Batman Returns
144,tbills2,Catwoman Returns,8,3 February 2014,"I believe the word you're looking for is 'Ahhhhh!'.All good things considered, Batman Returns is unbelievably awesome. Tim Burton created a despairingly epic world in Gotham City, and I cannot say enough how perfectly wonderful the movie Batman Returns is! It's great all in an atmospheric nostalgic kinda way. The Batman script has been ripped to pieces in a way through way of the imaginative interrupted mind of Tim Burton, and it all works well and it's all to be well loved. Thank you, Mr. Burton. Batman Returns is one of my favorite movies, of all movies considered. I greatly prefer your Batman as best of all!Batman Returns is a visual and audio masterpiece, basically! It's so well-done, to only say the least about it. The actors are excellent, and the overall indulgent satisfaction level of Batman Returns is immeasurable. I loooove it. Michael Keaton, Michelle Pfeiffer, Danny DeVito...the stars are terrifically cast...look, here is the one thing about Batman Returns that you might have not noticed when watching it, sort of Batman Returns' sexy little secret.....Catwoman is actually the main star, and not Batman! Can you believe it? Catwoman is the lead character. What an unforeseen, yet I say, lovely change of fortunate circumstance for us, the viewers, and I do agree that it may be a bit misleading and ultimately untrue to the original desired upon essence of even making a Batman movie to begin with, whereas Batman is the main star, obviously, but who's complaining? I'm not! Michelle Pfeiffer is incredible! Michelle makes this movie. She is just incredible as Catwoman in Batman Returns. Pfeiffer's purr-fect for the part. I love Michelle's black leather catsuit. This movie is so clearly wholly surrounded around Michelle Pfeiffer's Catwoman, Selina Kyle, while Michael Keaton the co-star is again excellent as Batman, Bruce Wayne. I am here to tell you this, the one particular scene where Catwoman is back handspringing out of the corner Gotham shop that she's set to explode, when she first meets Batman and Penguin in the street where she stops, standing in front of them breathing heavily, looks at the two and in feign disgust she simply utters... Meow ...and the building blows suddenly and then she's off! Oh my God, I love that moment, like, understand, I deeply loooooove that moment. I do. I deeply love that moment as deeply as I love Michelle Pfeiffer, and like, I loooooove Michelle Pfeiffer, deeply. All of my deepest desires are perfectly summed up in that one deep beautiful moment from Catwoman Returns, I mean, Batman Returns. It's really, really deeeeeep.",Batman Returns
145,ivo-cobra8,"Batman Returns is dark, violent and a worthy sequel to the 1989 Batman.",10,11 October 2015,"One of the darker films ever made. It is one of my personal favorite Batman movies. Batman Returns is dark, violent and a worthy sequel to the 1989 Batman. Danny DeVito gave a brilliant performance as The Penguin. The only two good things in this movie are return of Michael Keaton as Bruce Wayne/Batman and Danny DeVito as The Penguin. I thought classic original Batman (1989) was way better film than this. Batman Returns is my second favorite Batman film in the franchise. The film has a many problems in here I didn't like and it annoys me, but there are other things I did like and love in the second installment.Things I don't like in this film: Michelle Pfeiffer as Selina Kyle/ Catwoman she was extremely violent woman. I still couldn't believe how could an grown aged woman act like a child, trying to be an animal and than she just rip off a harmless pet rubber animals stuff them in a sinker , destroying a doll house, spraying a t-shirt and than acting that she is the queen in this movie? She wasn't written and portrayed by the comic books like was Anne Hathaway in The Dark Knight Rises. Selina Kyle was never a secretary like she was in Shreck Company, she wasn't a vigilante, violent or angry woman. She was a cat burglar and a thief. She didn't went around cutting people like she did in this film, she only did what was necessary to do for survival. That is the main problem in this film. I still prefer and think Kim Basinger is much better better actress than Michelle Pfeifer is and I still love Vicky Vale much better than Selina Kyle. Sorry Bat fans. I wish there wouldn't be Max Shreck in this film because he look's like a selfish lunatic person. Those are the main problems I don't like in this film, that is why this movie is not better than his superior predecessor. Things I do like in this film:The Action sequences are outstanding and awesome and Fight sequences are fantastic. The first fight between Batman and Catwoman is awesome. The film is very dark which I love that in the film. Michael Keaton reprise his role back as Bruce Wayne/Batman. It is my childhood film and I will always watch it. It was a big hit in 1992 when the film come out, there were different times then, than they are today. The story centers around Christmas Eve. The Penguin, releases several bats that fly frantically around the girl's (Ice Princess) head, causing her to lose her balance and fall, but giving the impression that Batman, visible to the crowd below, had pushed her. She lands on the tree switch, lighting it up and unleashing a flurry of bats that the Penguin had hidden within the branches. Batman attempts to flee. I love that Batman flees in this film around Bats flying the crowd. It shows his symbol stands for Bat which he is a Batman. He also try to save that girl when she was kidnapped but couldn't. The Penquin and Catwoman becomes alley and they set up Batman to be a criminal. I love how The Penguin had placed a control device under the car that let he himself steer it from an arcade-style car hidden in a trailer. Batman, helpless, is trapped behind the wheel of the Batmobile as it veers through the streets, knocking over city property and frightening citizens. Batman manages to remove the control device before anyone is killed, and returns home. That is the best awesome scene I have seen. Batskiboat using in this film that batman drives on the sewer was FANTASTIC! Beside Batmobil there was other vehicle used in this film. Batman saving all the children from Penquin was also awesome. Batman was a real hero in this film. There was no Robin in here. Which I am happy about it. Batman does not need any sidekick to help him out. I hate Robin, don't get me wrong I don't like that character and I never did. Michael Keaton Is excellent as Bruce Wayne/Batman his acting performance to me in both Burton films is better than Christian Bale is. Michael Keaton's Bruce Wayne was a clearly uncomfortable man, a mumbling solitary eccentric, ill at ease in his own skin and with other people. In the Batsuit, though, he becomes the beast he really is, an imposing personification of vengeance and fear, despite his slighter frame. There's something far more sympathetic about Keaton's Bruce Wayne. Maybe it's because he was never recorded throwing a wobbler on set. Tim Burton did a great job directing and producing the second Batman film. I love the costume designer by Bo Welch for Catwoman, Batman and Penquin. J. P. Morgan's wardrobe was used for inspiration on Max Shreck's costume design. I think those three actors Michael Keaton, Danny DeVito and Michelle Pfeifer did a great character chemistry and good acting performance. CGI was also not bad for the bats I real love it. I love this film not as much as I love The Dark Knight and Batman but I still love it. The rating I give to this film is 10/10. Anything under 7 would be ridiculous, as anyone claiming this isn't at least a GOOD action film.",Batman Returns
146,natashabowiepinky,Bat-tastic,8,5 February 2013,"This has the classic Burton touches of the prequel, as a dark and intimidating Gotham is menaced by killer clowns, fire eaters and a lady with a poodle(!) The imagination this chap displays is so off the chart, he was only ever going to be a brilliant director, or a permanent asylum patient. Fortunately, it hasn't just got one mildly compelling character in The Joker like numero uno, but three riveting ones in The Penguin, Catwoman and even Max Shreck, played by the ever-reliable Christopher Walken. Batman still feels like a bit-part player in his own movie, but with so much going on, who cares? Every minute something wild and wacky happens, but if you think the film lacks heart... Wait until you see the ending. The fates of two of the cast are movingly poignant, but lay to rest the argument that Burton is just a visual director. Then again, if you'd seen Edward Scissorhands, you'd know that already...",Batman Returns
147,fernandoschiavi,"Even with flaws, the film overcomes its previous film in all respects and no doubt marked a whole generation",7,8 August 2015,"After a successful first foray into the Dark Knight film, comes three years after the continuation of the story to the big screen especially for first have cost $ 35 million and yielded over $ 400 million at the box office for the coffers of Warner Brothers. And who again assumes the command of this second adventure superhero of Gotham City is Tim Burton, the director of the eccentricities and visual appeal enviable.Many of the previous errors were avoided, but it is clear that others insist permeate this sequence. Now, after running the first Baman, Tim Burton continued to create its bizarre characters and extravagant and began a partnership with his usual collaborator Johnny Depp in the mega-acclaimed hit Edward Scissorhands 1990 - and now enjoying more success returned to continue the saga of Batman, taking advantage of the fact that much more freedom than before, as he also assumed the position of producer of this continuation. Burton called Daniel Waters to write based on the first script by Sam Hamm, the same as the first movie. For this task, two super villains of Batman were scaled to give work to the hero, that even with the best performance of Michael Keaton in the previous, is overcome by the new double evil of Gotham.Many fans wanted to Catwoman as the main villain of the film, but Burton dismissed this possibility, since the comic makes it clear that the two are not always enemies, and eventually teaming up. This duality of Catwoman is featured in the film. While Selina Kyle and Bruce Wayne is interested in each other, Catwoman and Batman have disagreements and try to eliminate each other. Pfeiffer causes absurdly dressed in leather clothing fair and those lips and eyes green giants, and is unrivaled as the character he was born to her becoming eternal symbol of sensuality in cinema with his mask and whip, and eclipsing all others in the cast of the film. The emotional instability of Selina Kyle is one of the high points of interpretation Michele Pffeifer that according to Burton, is an impressive professional. The chemistry between the character and Batman is a pleasant surprise - just observe the sequences filmed in the ballroom costumes and Wayne Manor.As well as with his Joker Nicholson in 1989, which was dances and some baseless narrative that served only to exaggerate the madness of the character - Burton and DeVito also deal with a deformed child like an animal that eats cats in a ""cage"" and that is the height of the construction Penguin as a character who apparently is a compulsive sexual way to stay looking young and beautiful girls with their constant panting breaths as if during a sexual act. Penguin is also clearly fall into the naive promises Shreck and never seems threatening, which is a problem because it is the principal enemy of Batman and justifies the presence of Catwoman on the scene .With the caveats in the construction of the characters in the view of Burton described above, other points are even more improved than the previous film. The Gotham City a wonderful art direction signed by Bo Welch and photography of Stefan Czapsky presents a noir atmosphere and decadent, showing a city intimidating and that keeps the smoke in the streets and now the Christmas atmosphere and snow makes everything even more tense , which leaves its mark and is the main element to differentiate photography from the first film.The fight scenes are better worked. The armor distinctly lighter and offering greater freedom of movement and choreography provides best fights better developed and realistic. The Batmobile was also used in the movie Batman with some changes, having the ability to stretch and shrink the body turning into a missile.The script manages to overcome the former bringing a slightly higher complexity. Again we see the similarities with Batman's enemies, since all choke and feelings, to go through some trauma, bring out another side of the personality that is averse to social rules that stifle.Unlike the first which is also bleak, this second film Burton sparked more protests by fans and critics. Much of what had been seen before, again appears more prominently as the Gothic settings, the psychological motivation of the characters, their crises and disturbances and the attention given to the antagonists, as we see Batman again be supporting in their own history. As with the Joker Jack Nicholson, now both the Penguin as Catwoman get the spotlight.Excessive gloomy weather has been criticized by many parents consider the film too dark and violent for children, who made up a significant portion of the public in theaters. Warner Bros., even with the good reception of the last movie, then decided to rethink the franchise's hero, paying attention mainly on criticism of the somber mood built by Burton, even though this is the ideal climate for the character, which is the world in which it is inserted.Danny Elfman once again back on the soundtrack and only confirms their work, further reinforcing the theme song and inserting new elements to a strong track that leaves the film again in an atmosphere of high tension, recording the theme song from Batman Burton on everyone's mind. Elfman and Burton is definitely a successful partnership where one complements the other, as well as John Williams and Steven Spielberg.The film, even with flaws, manages to overcome his previous film in all respects and no doubt marked a whole generation. Has a better script, a good climax and remarkable characters. No doubt it was worth it and this is consolidated as one of the best versions of Batman in movies, not to mention the latest masterpieces Nolan fleeing any adjustment already made previously been revolutionizing and reinventing the character uniquely and original, going back to their origins.",Batman Returns

I actually like this version, since Batman is supposed to be the DARK Knight. There are two more memorable villains, Danny Devito as the Penguin, and especially Michelle Pfeiffer as the slinky and sexy Catwoman. Not only that, the special effects, production design (who wouldn't want the Batmobile!), and music score by Danny Elfman are top notch. But AGAIN, there is absolutely no character development for the hero of this film Batman, with the villains again both getting back stories as to why they become who they are. We will have to wait until the 5th installment of Batman (2005's Batman Begins) to finally learn why Bruce Wayne became Batman.

One knows from the start that there is no way for it to really end well. I found the film a little too dark and a little too slow as it moves to what seems like an inevitable bitter end. I think it could use some editing to speed the pace a bit. The film is hard to watch at times and difficult to call enjoyable, but the story is still powerful. It is difficult to imagine that such a dark film will attain much cinematic success. It is a powerful film, but I doubt I will ever want to watch it again. With this culture of ignorance in the Information Age persisting, fed by the corporate media, Michael Keaton has appeared in one of his best films yet, and in one that brings humanity down to its root nature.",Batman Returns
153,perfectbond,The decline begins...,7,13 February 2003,"In the original Batman, the villain, the Joker was a sufficient force to oppose Batman. In Batman Returns, apparently the producers didn't think that any of villains alone were of sufficient magnitude so they pitted three, the Catwoman, the Penguin, and Max Schreck, to face our hero. Although it should be noted that the Catwoman is not merely a villain but a love interest as well. Like in the case of the Joker, the Penguin's origin was modified from his origin in the comics. It is more grotesque and the character himself as portrayed by Devito is more grotesque and revenge minded than his comics' counterpart who is more concerned with material gain. The materialistic villain in Batman Returns is Max Schreck. Digressing slightly, I just want to say I am a huge fan of both Devito and Christopher Walken. Batman's role is actually slightly diminished since the villains, in addition to fighting him, predicatably turn on each other. Again like it's predecessor, the props, sets, and special effects were state of the art for their time. Thankfully Burton stuck around to helm this one as well. He would be conspicuous by his absence from the director's chair by the time the next installment was released. Solid entertainment, 7/10.",Batman Returns

The film has some of the best Batman villains of the lot with the brilliant Christopher Walken as Max Shrek, Danny DeVito as the very sympathetic but equally murderous Penguin and Michelle Pfeiffer as the beautiful but incredibly dangerous Catwoman. As well as, of course, Michael Keaton as Batman.The plot's a lot better than the first film with more twists and turns and although there's 3 villains they seem to compliment each other and don't over-bloat the film, a common critique is there's not enough Bruce Wayne or Batman in the movie and I think I do probably agree but it's not as bad that he doesn't appear at all.8/10: Beautiful cinematography and great villains give this film a lot of points.",Batman Returns

Keaton puts the cape on a second time for a wonderfully meek Batman/Bruce Wayne. Director Tim Burton, however, appears to be more interested in doing things the way he wants, instead of even attempting to continue a good story. The first was a darker and realistic take on a superhero that most be associated Adam West with — but the darkness and reality of the 1989 film worked well. Here, however, Burton tries to make ""Returns"" darker, uglier and less realistic. Instead of The Penguin being a beak-nosed mobster who wears a tuxedo, he's a mutated human living in the sewer. Instead of Catwoman being everybody's favorite anti-hero, she's wicked enough to be the main villain. Instead of Billy Dee Williams reprising his role as Harvey Dent, he's replaced with Christopher Walken as the evil Max Shreck — a new character who looks more like a mad scientist than a corrupt businessman. Even the art design of Gotham City is significantly different and less believable than the first. Burton completely ruined the wonderful world he made in the previous film. Danny Elfman's score is the only thing this and the first film are equal at; everything else is significantly inferior. A huge disappointment.** (out of four)",Batman Returns

""Batman"" wasn't, in my opinion, fully in the hands of Tim Burton, thus it didn't look so much of a Burton film. It had typical Burton's elements in it, but it wasn't so freely his own. ""Batman Returns"" is fully his to the core and that shows.Visually BR is still a stunning piece of cinema. Gothical Gotham city is drawn beautifully in the front of our eyes while Batman (Michael Keaton) battles against the Penguin (Danny DeVito) and the Catwoman (Michelle Pfeiffer) and Max Shreck (Christopher Walken). Of all the Batman movies (I still haven't seen Batman beyond) Batman Returns has the best and most fitting cast. It's hard to give out anyone who wouldn't fit in their roles.There is some plot holes but in Burtons case they don't really matter that much; he's good in hiding those small errors in the over all atmosphere of his films.I've heard that from the some reason hardcore fans of Batman don't appreciate Burtons vision, but as a person who likes Batman I really can recommend this stunning vision to everyone, because it has style beyond typical comic book adaptations and it really shows what a talented director can make out of a well known character if just given free hands.",Batman Returns
158,eibon09,Dark Undertones,9,14 March 2002,"While not as good as the first film, Batman Return(1992) is way better than the last two when the series became dumb and dumber.  Deals with childhood traumas, and adult angst that results from feelings of alienination during childhood years.  Not one of the main characters were blessed with happy memories of their childhood, and each has their own alter-ego to fight this traumatic pain.  The opening scene is an example of this idea, and one which leads to the main theme of the movie.
Michael Keaton as Bruce Wayne/Batman becomes more melencoly, more saddened by unhappy childhood memories, and saddled with a feeling of loneliness. Danny Devito is a disappointing followup as a villain after the flamboyant performance of Jack Nicholson in Batman(1989).  Michelle Pfeiffer is both sexy and hard edged in the role of Catwoman, which is her most complex and ambiouous.  When Tim Burton did the Batman films they were very good, and had some provocative ideas about childhood memories, and the feelings of being an outsider.
I would have to see a director's cut of this sequel as I feel that some scenes look as if they were trimmed, and maybe there were good scenes cut from the film to fit a PG-13 rating.  Scenes, which feels trimmed are the erotic games of cat and mouse between Batman and Catwoman.  Films based on comics are more interesting when good and evil become a grey matter where nothing is certain, and the architecture stands with a moody broodish quality.  Christopher Walken plays his usual sarcastic evil villain, and plays it with a dark coldness that is a trademark of a Walken villain.",Batman Returns

This feeling went on for many years and it is reflected in an earlier review I wrote on the film back in 2002. Now, after having seen Batman Returns within the last 4 to 6 years, I have had a changed of mind on this film and consider it my favorite of the four Batman films made from 89-97. It has a feel that I connected with more recently than I did during my earlier viewings. The villains walk a blurred line between evil and pathetic and sometimes this line blurs where they are interchangeable. Sure the film has its flaws, but still I think it is well made and a little underrated. That is a sadness that hovers over the characters like a overseeing shadow. I wish they had bought back Michelle Pfeiffer's Cat Woman for another film.",Batman Returns

Tim Burton returns to direct a truly great sequel, once more giving us a darkly lit and truly different world. Some hash it for the realismf*ck you!! It's Batman, the super hero genre in general. Anyways, Danny Elfman reprises his role as the tour de force composer , delivering a score that sounds similar to his work on ""Edward Scissorhands"" and ""Nightmare Before Christmas"". I was thrilled to listen to it, bringing every moment in the film to its utmost sharpness.Michael Keaton returns (no pun intended) and once again plays the role perfectly. While Vicki Vale may be gone, Bruce gets to tangle with Michelle Pfeiffer. Her performance was insane, sexy and full of zest she constantly brung to the screen. Did Danny DeVito really measure up to Jack Nicholson? Hel yeah! This is truly how Bob Kane would have brought this character to life. DeVito captures the character quite well, both comically and with a sense of rage. Michael Gough is back as well, just another plus. Christopher Walken is our sleazy business man, extraordinarily well done. It's a visual style and a story line only Tim Burton could bring together so well. Keep in mind there are a lot of funny lines in this flick, but it never downplays the seriousness of it all. The mood of the film, along with a lot of the story is incredibly dark, malicious, and even somewhat disturbing. It's one of the aspects that really draw me to this film.A not so light hearted, well done sequel. The effects and fight scenes are as well done as the rest of the film and original. I had always wished Burton had done the other two sequels. I can only imagine how much greater they'd be, and the marks they could have left on film history.",Batman Returns

Then suddenly this new vile group of insane circus freaks come onto the scene and begin wreaking havoc, they are led by the deformed freak, the Penguin (Danny DeVito). At the same time a female cat burglar comes onto the scene pulling off many small time robberies, she ends up joining forces with the Penguin, this woman is known as Catwoman (Michelle Pfeiffer). Batman has to naturally battle these two foes to try and protect Gotham City, when in the meantime the Penguin runs for Mayor of Gotham City, with the help of corrupt business man Max Shreck (Christopher Walken). In the end, though, we learn that the Penguin has much more on his mind than just becoming Mayor, this results in Batman having to use all of his cutting edge technology and all of his wits to stop the demented Penguin and his gang.I think this comment should first focus on what is good about this film, rather than focusing on the negative. First, the Gotham City that has been made within this film is truly unique and is one of the best versions of Gotham ever captured on film. Second, the production values are very good, Tim Burton's directing is good, and the script is fairly well written; as well the acting is top notch, this film was very well casted. All of the other stuff, like cinematography, score, and such are all really good as well, but that stuff is really all that is good.The problems with Batman Returns are many. First and foremost the film focuses too much on Batman's villains rather than Batman himself, now this was a problem the first Batman had, but this time around, with an extra villain, Batman has even less screen time. Another major problem with this film is it took way too many departures from the comic books, there are many points in this film that I wonder if I am even watching a Batman film. As well, this is an action movie with very little action within it, and the little you do get is not engaging at all, you just want the action to end once you get to it.Overall this is just not that great of a movie, and is really only a Batman film by name only.Score: A decent 6 out of 10.",Batman Returns

I had so many action-figures of Batman as well as the other characters, and I'd play with them every time as a kid.Batman is one of the best superheroes in DC Comics. Is there anyone better? The ones I can think of are Superman and Wonder Woman.Batman Returns was the first Batman movie I seen. I did see the other movie (Batman), but I seen that after Batman Returns. As a kid, I thought Batman Returns was the first movie followed by Batman, but it's actually the other way around. Batman Returns is a great name to describe the sequel. He's practically back! Batman has returned for the sequel. Technically, Batman Returns is Batman 2. The sequel to Batman.I'm glad a sequel happened, and I also wanted a third Batman movie with exactly the same cast, but it wasn't to be.I desperately wanted the video (Batman Returns), and I remember seeing the sequel nicely displayed at a retail store named Woolworths, and was begging my mum to get it for me which she did. She knew how much I liked the superhero. The movie I received was a gift. Later, I also received the first movie, and I'd watch Batman and Batman Returns together.I actually think Batman Returns is better than Batman. Which do you think is the better movie? A poll is needed. I'm surprised though Batman (movie) has a much higher rating than Batman Returns on here. I think the ratings for both these movies should swap around. Why did you like the sequel? The sequel introduces us with a couple of new enemies: Catwoman and Penguin.The Penguin is one of my favourite enemies of the Batman. The Penguin's real name is Oswald Cobblepot. His parents were disgusted how he appeared, and threw him away as a baby. He was pretty much abandoned. If you see the start of the movie, you'll understand why he's the Penguin. I liked how these Penguins raised Oswald Cobblepot. Danny DeVito was the Penguin, and he was the right choice. He even appears like a Penguin.There's another character named Max, but he isn't considered a Batman enemy. I didn't like Max because he almost killed Catwoman. He's a millionaire. Catwoman was Max's secretary. I really liked the part where Catwoman returns to her apartment, and you'll see how she practically turns into the Catwoman. She seeks revenge on Max.I also like how Batman or Bruce Wayne speaks in the sequel. Michael Keaton has to be the best Batman - I think he is.Batman Returns is a pretty dark superhero movie, and very young people may find the sequel unsuitable even though Batman is very popular among the children. Batman is suppose to be dark. Batman Returns looks more darker than Batman it appears.I definitely like to see the sequel again at some point.",Batman Returns

165,dr_foreman,highs and lows,8,17 March 2004,"Here's the one-sentence review of ""Batman Returns"" - any scene with Catwoman is great, and any scene with the Penguin is awful.There are exceptions, of course, but the quality of this film undeniably see-saws based on these characters.  Whereas Catwoman is genuinely sympathetic - isn't it horrible, watching a nice woman get brutally murdered by a heartless tycoon? - the Penguin tries to evoke sympathy but is ultimately too grotesque to move me.  Am I really supposed to care about a character who bites people's noses off, plans to murder children, and spits up loads of forest-green goo?  It doesn't help that DeVito overplays the part terribly, burying any potential for subtlety by screaming out all his lines.  Listen to how he mangles ""they wouldn't put me on a pedestal, so now, I'm layin' them on a slab.""  That line could be pathetic and sad, or maybe scary, but the way DeVito plays it, it's merely loud.Thankfully, DeVito is the only acting dud here.  Pfeiffer plays it just right, volleying between her vampish and cutesy personas with incredible skill.  Walken is also great; he chews the scenery like a madman, but that's exactly the kind of acting that's called for in a movie where even the sets are outrageously over-the-top.  And of course, Keaton is still good, although one can understand why he quit after this film, since he's given very little to do.On balance, ""Returns"" is the best of the series, because there are many genuinely emotional moments.  But there's a distinctly grotesque quality to the movie that forces it slightly out of the mainstream, which is a shame - its relative commercial failure led to the series' descent into mindless popcorn drivel, starting with the next entry.",Batman Returns

Penguin is the biggest character in this movie I'd say, and early on I thought he had legitimate potential. While it doesn't make any sense, his backstory is interesting - he was abandoned by his parents, and drifted to the (abandoned?) zoo and grew up in the sewers with penguins. How he got food to survive for 33 years, why he looks 70 years old as a 33 year old, how he acquired things like the rubber ducky or his many umbrellas, why he never went aboveground, or how he survived and learned about the world if he never went aboveground: none of that matters. What matters is that he wanted to learn who his parents were and make Gotham stop taking everything for granted. He makes a decent play in blackmailing Shreck to gain power, and then Shreck gives him the platform to become mayor. This is where it becomes clear that Burton is not interested in logic. Penguin, the grotesque and uncharismatic sewer creature, is somehow beloved by everyone, even after biting a dude's nose off and making two gross sexual comments to women. There's no reason for him to be mayor - he's never really given the chance to be a creative, manipulative planner and is just thrust into the role through citywide pity. Even though he has no coherent plan throughout the movie, I perked up when I heard his scheme at the end to kidnap kids to show Gotham all they took for granted. The plan was literally stealing them and putting them in jail cells on a train riding around town, which was quickly and anticlimactically thwarted by Batman. To his credit, he seems unsurprised his half-baked idea didn't work and says it's time for plan B: blow up the city by attaching rocket launchers to hundreds of penguins and mind-controlling them. Of course! Batman sees this on his special penguin radar and, in one of countless instances of boringly lazy writing, Alfred jams the signal so the penguins return to the zoo. That's the climax? Then Penguin has to come out to the streets in his rubber ducky to really show Gotham who's boss (don't worry about what he was gonna do in the rubber ducky), and Batman drives right into him thanks to the handy penguin radar that also tracks big rubber duckies, sending Penguin into the water below. Aside from being half the age he looked, I liked the way Penguin's look was designed, but his dialogue is poor, he has no real ambition throughout the movie, and his one plan that could've been coherent was comically stupid.I'll spend less time on Catwoman, since she doesn't even have the promising aspects that Penguin does. She is presented as a nervous and incompetent secretary, but after being shoved out a window goes insane and becomes the Catwoman. No, there's no reason why her near-death made her want to be whatever she became, but don't worry, she actually never has any plans or goals. She'd be happy to kill Shreck, but isn't focused on this during the movie, and gets mad at Batman and Penguin when they fight her, but there isn't a single time when she dresses as Catwoman with any goal or plan of what she wants to do. She simply goes and sees if anyone looks ripe to... intimidate, I guess? I'm really not sure. She also gets shot four times and tases a dude while grabbing an electrical wire until he's fried to a crisp, but of course she doesn't die because she has 9 lives. Her sudden transition from being extremely clumsy and awkward to super athletic and aggressive is not at all believable, and even aside from that is a boring character with literally no ambition or ideas.Batman is given relatively little screen time, and Keaton is still fine as Batman, but completely lifeless. Gone are any moral dilemmas of taking the law into his own hands or even just creative ways to stop the villains. His penguin/rubber ducky radar, frequency jammer, and being a sick DJ on the Penguin tracks are all he needs.The things wrong with these three characters embody the many problems the film faces as a whole. There's no thematic material or ideas, none of the characters have real ambition or plans, and the set pieces that are supposed to feel exciting are either rote or laughably unrealistic. For every uninspired Batman punching people scene, we have Penguin being lured into a bizarre underground office for his mayoral campaign by a raw fish, Catwoman eating one of Penguin's birds to show she means business (I guess???), and the hundreds of penguins tossing those goggles on to get ready for the rockets. I'll give the movie credit in the few places it's due: the score was quite good, and the visuals of Gotham were pretty solid, as long as you ignore that they walk on the same street literally the entire movie. People generally seem to regard Batman Returns with respect, and I can't see what element of the movie isn't abysmal - the characters, script, and plot are all bottom notch. That also makes me scared for Batman Forever and Batman and Robin - can they really be worse than this mess? None of the events in Batman Returns make any sense at all, and the only pleasant parts are when you realize how ridiculous the movie has gotten and laugh at the game of one-upsmanship Burton plays with himself in regard to nonsensical plot points. If you want a campy, fun villain-based vision of Gotham, watch the show Gotham. If you want a dark Batman, watch the Nolan trilogy. If you want a well-done Michael Keaton Batman, watch the 1989 Batman. Only turn to Batman Returns if you're truly hankering for a movie with ambitionless and uncreative characters and a plot that has no interest in making sense.",Batman Returns
172,TheMan3051,Barely the 2nd best in the series.,9,16 June 2002,"If Harvey Dent would have been in this movie as planned perhaps Batman Forever might have been the 2nd best. Still this is a great movie. Also due to the fact that Batman is the lead character in this movie, unlike in the original, Michael Keaton's performance is way better than in the original. He also does more of his own stunts in this movie than in the original. Now let's not forget Catwoman. She is awesome! Still the duck is the real star of the movie. That duck kicks ass!",Batman Returns
173,Darth_Osmosis,Christmas in Gotham!,10,7 June 2018,"""Batman Returns"" feels a lot like its predecessor ""Batman(1989)"" before it, but everything turned up a notch. It's darker, even more atmospheric and more violent. It also started the trend of two villains per movie, and was one of the few to pull it off, at least back then! The Christmas setting is great and works like a charm with the already overly gothic tone and look. Action is great and stylish, Batman is cool and intimidating. There is a lot of new gadgets and the Batmobile has also new tricks up it's sleeve. Full of dark humor and a bit twisted moments. Both villains are memorable for different reasons. Michelle Pfeiffer is the perfect Catwoman and Danny DeVito is great as a disturbing and grotesque version of the Penguin character. To top that off Christopher Walken has also an awesome part! This is the logical and awesome continuation from Batman(1989) and it remains one of my favorite comic book films to this day. Perfect Christmas viewing :)",Batman Returns
174,Ali_John_Catterall,So much yummier,9,19 November 2009,"Cast your mind back to the scorching summer of 1989. Remember what a huge deal Tim Burton's Batman was? Those restricted set-reports! That massive press campaign! That Prince soundtrack! 'Batmania' they called it.However, this writer also remembers a conversation between two girls at a bus stop, slathered with that ubiquitous black and yellow poster, a week after it came out. ""Saw that the other day."" ""Wossit like?"" ""Bit boring."" History hasn't been particularly kind to Batman (less so to Prince's score. Wither 'Lemon Crush'?) Nevertheless, it did generate $750 million worth of merchandise which meant sequel time.Burton hadn't originally signed up for a follow-up (ah, such innocent times), describing such a prospect as ""a dumbfounded idea"" and even admitting the original was, yes, ""a little boring at times"". Any subsequent film would have to be treated like ""another Batman movie altogether"".And so it was: without stinting on the pathos (Danny DeVito's Penguin) or sex appeal (Michelle Pfeiffer's astoundingly horny bad girl Catwoman), Burton would give full vent to his German Expressionist tendencies (see Christopher Walken's second-tier baddie Max Shrek) and cartoonish indulgences. This was more like it! Pre-Batman Begins, Batman Returns is the best Batman film in the canon. No Prince, either.",Batman Returns
175,baileycrawly,Entertaining,7,20 September 2020,"Batman Returns is much more in line with Burton's trademark style than the original Batman was, and perhaps that's because the studio may have lightened up a bit on him after the massive success of the first one. I may never know the reason, but this one is different than the predecessor.Of course, the work the cast puts in determines the overall tone of the film, and this one has a few new characters - most notably Christopher Walken and Danny DeVito - who added something a little different that wasn't there before. DeVito plays The Penguin/creepy sexual predator, and Christoper Walken plays the holier-than-thou philanthropist who convinces an entire town of his kind actions while blinding them to the nasty realities. Those two characters bring about a much darker film, but it also gives characters that have even more depth than Nicholson's Joker.The big question that is relevant to the film, however is: Is it good? The answer is yes, but it's not as good as the original Batman. DeVito really does a terrific job as The Penguin, and he sells his character pretty well. Of course, even under all the makeup, it's impossible to see him as anyone but Danny DeVito, but you would be hard-pressed to find anyone else as devoted to that role as he was. And he clearly enjoyed doing it a lot. The Penguin character, according to Burton, was the major issue the studio had with the film. The darkness, coupled with the effects of the character toward the end of the film, made it difficult to market him in a McDonalds Happy Meal, so Tim had to deal with a lot of back and forth to get this movie made.Once again, we have the brilliant Danny Elfman doing the score, taking the work he did on the original and expanding upon it, doing a fantastic job as always. The film benefitted greatly from his work.Batman Returns doesn't equal the quality and entertainment value of the original, but it does offer a fun and entertaining experience that's well worth watching.",Batman Returns
176,chrisbrown6453,Family values come up unexpectedly in Batman Returns.,4,25 October 2001,"Poor Danny DeVito is the Penguin, a fine-feathered villain who turns out bad because he was dumped by his parents. The baby was raised by birds, and now it's hard to tell if he's foul, or fowl. His sad saga is only one of the many threads that tangle the plot of Tim Burton's partially successful, but really bad, sequel to his 1989 Batman. In Returns, we're given three villains for the price of one, but more is not always better. Any one of them could have carried his, or her, own movie, but here they just keep stepping on each other's toes (paws? claws?). The paws are provided by the marvelous Michelle Pfeiffer, as Catwoman. She gets the funniest lines and knows just what to do with them. She is spectacular in her basic black, home-sewn catsuit and her spike-heeled boots. The bullwhip is the perfect accessory to complete the outfit. Too bad the script can't quite figure out what she represents. DeVito is fine, but his birdman of Gotham, badly in need of a visit to the dentist, grows a tad wearisome. Christopher Walken completes the villainous trilogy as Max Shreck (great name), the unscrupulous businessman whose greed may be the downfall of Batman's hometown. He wisely, and skillfully, plays it down.Oh, yes, before we forget--there is what seems like a cameo appearance by Michael Keaton, as the caped crusader himself. The story is overly complicated, the transitions between story lines rather bumpy and the characters (with the exception of that darn Cat) don't really grab our interest. Still, the movie is a visual marvel, great at putting its money where our eyes are, and that's no guano. Would love to see more of Pfeiffer's kitten with a whip in future installments. Don't miss the credits at the end of Batman Returns, to see who plays the Penguin's daddy.",Batman Returns
177,chrisbrown6453,This is the one that should be forgotten!,4,31 July 2000,"This time around, Tim Burton messed up.  With Michael Keaton returning to the title role of Batman, and adding Michele Pfieffer as the Cat Woman and Danny DeVito as the Penguin, you would think that this coupled with the hype from the first movie would be enough to propel this movie into the stratosphere.  Well, in my opinion, you will find yourself being disappointed. While Michele Pfieffer is as sexy as could be in a sleek, tight, all leather black suit, Danny DeVito strikes out as the least scary villain Penguin. This movie is a big disappointment to the Batman saga, and should be forgotten.",Batman Returns
178,DavidSim240183,The Bat is back!,10,19 June 2007,"The Batman film series got off to a fantastic start with Tim Burton's moody and atmospheric 1989 classic. And then in 1992 he helmed this sequel, Batman Returns, which is in every regard just as good as its predecessor, if not better. Sadly, the series went seriously off course when Joel Schumacher inherited the directors chair, and churned out the dreadful Batman Forever and the astonishingly dire Batman & Robin. It wasn't until Batman Begins that things finally got back on track.But in 1992, Batman was still going strong. And with Batman Returns, Tim Burton has really outdone himself. The first part was a tough act to follow, but Burton, great filmmaker that he is, crafted an even more ambitious sequel that weaves a multilayered screenplay of character arcs. A true masterpiece.Burton's vision of Gotham City is more extraordinary than it was last time. I don't even know where to begin to describe it. There is so much to see. Gotham City exists as an extension of the psychological states of the characters, and Burton's imagination has really been allowed to rove. Because the film has a Christmas setting, the snow serves to intensify the already impressive set-design. I love the breathtaking opening shot of Gotham City, wintry and frigid, with the skyscrapers barely visible in the background.Then there's Gotham Zoo. And what a sight it is! Giant crabs. Towering monuments. Batman Returns is worth watching just to drink in all of the astonishing sets Burton keeps throwing up at us.On to the story. BR is a much more ambitious film. There are quite a few story arcs the film juggles. Its a testament to the writers that they keep them all going as skilfully as they do. Batman (Michael Keaton) still defends Gotham City by night, but new dangers are about to make themselves known.First off is the Penguin (Danny DeVito), an aquatic bird-man dumped into the sewers at birth by his horrified parents. Now he plots revenge on the society that shunned him. Then there's Selina Kyle (Michelle Pfeiffer), who becomes Catwoman after being pushed out a window by her power-hungry boss Max Shreck (Christopher Walken), nipped back to life by the alley cats of Gotham City. And Shreck has his own plans for Gotham, and proxy's the Penguin as the new mayor to fulfil his own ends.There may be a lot going on in this film, but I never found it difficult to follow the action. In fact I think superhero films work best when they craft screenplays that resonate on many different levels. Films like Superman, and the later likes of X2 and Spider-Man 2.All the cast deliver the goods. Michael Keaton again turns in a haunting portrait of a psychologically split man. But its really in the supporting players where the film opens up. Danny DeVito turns in a cracking performance. He brings a real animalistic edge to the part. Lecherous, leering, a yucky green bile drooling from his mouth and an astonishing makeup job make the Penguin a much more obscene creature than he ever was in the comics. DeVito's brash attitude coupled with his diminutive frame make him ideal for the role.And then there's Michelle Pfeiffer. Normally a very closed-off actress, she's a total revelation as Catwoman. Throwing herself into the part with gusto, she crackles with sexual energy, and smoulders in her scenes with Batman. The chemistry between the two of them is electric. Pfeiffer gives quite an astute and well judged performance. The way she acts out her split into psychosis is very well done. The scene where she defaces her pink, cutesy apartment is quite shocking and strangely liberating all at the same time.And although her feline powers are never properly explained, I liked the way her story arc is written. Her slowly building insanity is highlighted well. She's let down and betrayed by all the men in her life. First her boss, Max Shreck pushes her out a window when she catches on to his nefarious schemes. Then she forms an alliance with the Penguin, who turns on her when she won't give him what he wants.And finally, there's Batman/Bruce Wayne. She recognises a kindred spirit in Bruce, and the two of them are irresistibly drawn to each other. But then there's a wonderful scene at a masquerade ball. She and Bruce are the only ones not wearing masks. And they inadvertently reveal their identities to one another. This is the one man she even halfway trusts, and he is her enemy. Its a haunting and emotionally fragile moment that shatters Selina's sanity once and for all.And Tim Burton delivers on the action scenes too. The Batmobile is just as stunning as ever. Especially the scene where it transforms into a missile and squeezes through a narrow alley. And there's quite a wide variety of gadgets and gimmicks on hand. The Penguin's multi-purpose umbrellas, from flamethrowers to a child's mobile. A giant rubber duck that functions as a car and a boat. Giant circus trains. And Batman's impressive Bat-Ski. (Although I did miss the Batwing).There is so much to recommend about this film. Danny Elfman turns in another magnificent film score. Alternately moody and exhilarating. All the different plot strands are resolved quite nicely. The Penguin's death scene is surprisingly moving. And so is Selina's. Until the film throws a last minute spanner in the works that really packs a punch. The closing shot is a whopper of a shocker.So sad that Burton was dropped after this. If he had continued, he undoubtedly would have made an even better additional saga. It wasn't to be, and the series hit a rough patch. But bear in mind it regained strength. Tim Burton's Batman films are still the highlight of the series for me. They really are among the most wonderful comic-book film adaptations ever made.",Batman Returns
179,SkullScreamerReturns,Best Batman - Best Burton,9,28 December 2019,"This is probably my favorite Batman movie ever. I usually watch the 1989 first movie and this sequel back to back, and they feel like parts of the same entity. The first one is the basic movie that everybody should watch but ""Batman Returns"" is a more dividing cult thing that some dislike but some really love.Tim Burton had more control over this one, so he went wild with his dark gothic fantasy visions. In addition to this being my favorite Batman movie it's also my favorite Burton movie. It's a bit darker and more twisted than most of his child-friendly fairytale stuff, so that makes it even more fascinating. The visual scenery is amazing, and with Danny Elfman's music it really creates an otherworldly feel.The cast is excellent too. I guess this was my first ever seen film with Christopher Walken. I didn't like him at first - before I even remembered his name I always thought ""oh, this is again that weird actor from Batman Returns"" but maybe for the same reason he became one of my favorite (weird) actors!It's one of my all-time favorite movies. For fans of gothic fantasy, surreal dreamlike visions and comic book movies that really look like a comic book... check it out!",Batman Returns
180,Cinemaniac1984,The Bat. The Cat. The Penguin. This tagline perfectly summed up Batman Returns.,9,18 July 2015,"Following the blockbusting success of Batman (1989), Michael Keaton returns as Batman/Bruce Wayne and Tim Burton returns to the director's chair in Batman Returns. This time there are two villains, The Penguin and Catwoman, that Batman must face off against. The film is noticeably darker compared to the first movie, and some parts were violent. Looking back now, its no wonder many parents were complaining that Batman Returns had scared and upset many young kids. Despite the fact Batman Returns was a box office success in 1992, it was a shame that Warner Bros asked Tim Burton to step aside from future directorial duties with the Batman franchise and in return Joel Schumacher took the family-friendly route with Batman Forever (1995) and Batman and Robin (1997) which did the franchise more harm that good. Michael Keaton also declined to return as Batman when Tim Burton did not return, with Val Kilmer and George Clooney respectively donning the Batman suit.Michael Keaton returns as Batman/Bruce Wayne who as Batman must take on The Penguin and Catwoman who both have sinister motives to cause chaos in Gotham City. Also, Bruce Wayne must contend with shady businessman Max Shreck who has sinister motives to build a power plant to drain Gotham City of its energy as well as pushing The Penguin for Mayor. Besides Christian Bale, I have always liked Michael Keaton as Batman. He brings a very darkly comic side to his role as well as maintaining a heroic and dramatic edge.Danny De Vito is totally unrecognisable in one of his best roles as The Penguin/Oswald Cobblepot, who lives in the sewers after he is dumped into a river as a baby by his high society parents 33 years ago after the discover to their horror that he is deformed. Oswald Cobblepot is raised in the sewers by a flock of penguins thus he later adopts his alter ego as The Penguin. The Penguin hatches a plan to unleash chaos onto Gotham City with the Red Triangle Gang made up of circus members, but not before kidnapping Max Shreck and blackmailing him into helping him become an accepted citizen in Gotham City as well as Max Shreck pushing him as a mayoral candidate in order to win over the support and appeal of the citizens of Gotham City.Michelle Pfeiffer is the mousy secretary Selina Kyle who Max Shreck and other corporate bosses treat her with contempt. Selina Kyle uncovers Max Shreck's sinister motives for his power plant and is pushed out of a window, believed to be killed. Selina Kyle is revived by a flock of cats and later violently lashes out, destroying her apartment and transforming her new life and personality by donning a new costume, adopting her new alter ego as Catwoman. Selina Kyle's personality also has transformed from meek and mild to deranged and sexually charged.Christopher Walken is the shady businessman Max Shreck who is seen as Gotham City's larger than life savior yet has sinister greedy motives to drain Gotham City of its power supply through his new power plant which will also see him rake in a lot of profit. Christopher Walken also bring an occasionally dark, deadpan and subtle humorous side to Max Shreck.Tim Burton is a quality director and he continues to bring his dark, brooding vision to the Batman franchise with this welcome sequel to the 1989 blockbuster. The story is excellent, art direction and make up top notch. The standout is The Penguin's make up, transforming Danny De Vito into an unrecognisable villain. The main cast which includes Michael Keaton, Danny De Vito, Michelle Pfeiffer and Christopher Walken were top notch.Besides The Dark Knight trilogy, Batman Returns did have a reputation for being violent and dark for children, however The Dark Knight trilogy did not seem to receive any criticisms, with audiences accepting that it would not be suitable for young children. As a 8 year old, I was shocked that Batman Returns received a M 15+ rating in Australia, however upon seeing it on home video, I wasn't bothered by its dark tone at all. After Batman Returns, the Batman franchise became family-friendly which may have seen the decline of the Batman franchise. To the relief of many Batman fans such as myself, Christopher Nolan and Christian Bale resurrected the Batman franchise with Batman Begins (2005).Batman Returns is still a pleasure to watch, although nothing can surpass the first Batman movie. Though it may be dark for a Batman movie, I still enjoy watching Batman Returns.9/10.",Batman Returns

Batman's fall from grace is another compelling, if brief, plot thread.

182,emperor_bender,Dark sequel,9,18 February 2009,"When I first rented Batman Returns, I immediately thought it was going to be less than exceptional. I mean, Jack Nicholson was undoubtedly the best part of the first, so without him, how could there be a good movie? Simple, throw in Danny DeVito.Batman Returns is an arguably more dark movie than Batman. There are more villains here, less actual dark comedy in a lot of aspects, and more nerve-striking issues. However, the music is similar to the first if not darker. The scenery is definitely more depressing than the first, every detail right down to the time of year. This movie follows the same comic-style format we came to love in the first Batman.Now for the performances. Michael Keaton thankfully returns as Batman/Bruce Wayne. He was great in the first movie, and just as much in this sequel. There was not enough screen time in the world for Keaton as Batman, need MORE! Danny DeVito gave an award-winning performance as The Penguin, the most grueling, disgusting, lovable, angry, evil, sad, pathetic villain ever to grace a superhero movie. You hate him so much yet feel so bad for him at the same time. And it explains him down to the last detail too, making it all the more conflicting. Michelle Pfeiffer was excellent as Catwoman/Selina Kyle. Two completely different personalities in one. She actually got a good amount of back story as well. Christopher Walken didn't disappoint as Max Shreck, the greedy, judgmental, selfish CEO of the power company. Michael Gough also thankfully returns as the lovable Alfred, and he was just as good here as well. Pat Hingle also returns as Gordon, although I feel he was really never in the spotlight.With lots of great twists and sub-plots, Batman Returns is sure to please any fan of the original.9/10",Batman Returns

184,charchuk,The best of the original franchise,8,25 June 2007,"An improvement over the original, mainly because Burton let his distinctive style come out. The story's a bit better, but it's the Gothic look of the film that makes me like it more. And also because Catwoman is probably the best Batman villain portrayed thus far. The romance in this film is far more interesting than in any of the other Batman films - especially Begins - and it's mostly because Michelle Pfeiffer is terrific. Keaton is better than in the first one, and Danny DeVito is pretty good, but I thought Christopher Walken was wasted in a rather useless villain role. It's easily the weirdest of all the Batman films, and it's also the best of the 'original' franchise.",Batman Returns

Though I don't think it lives up to the legacy of 'Batman', it does a great job keeping up.Good: It's a dark and gritty version of the Batman which thankfully returns from its predecessor. Keaton and Devito provide golden performances and Michael Gough does a grand job of Alfred. As a minor antagonist, Catwoman is good for the most part with only a few things I would change. The action is good for the most part with a more comedic side without completely disregarding the tone. The gun sound effects are massively improved and the music and cinematography is excellent as expected.Bad: I hated the character of Max Schreck as a villain and as a character in general. No motive, nothing interesting, nothing; just a pawn to the penguins chess board. I didn't really like Catwoman's costume and felt it was very sloppy and odd. It feels like it do desperately craved two hours when it could have been 15 minutes shorter. For example, in total, the penguin has THREE total plans just to slip over that 2 hour mark.Best Part: When the penguin assumes command over the Batmobile.8/10",Batman Returns

Michael Keaton beats Adam West, George Clooney and Val Kilmer by a mile as the Dark Knight. His performance isn't Oscar worthy or anything, but it was still good.The best performances are obviously given by the three villains though. Danny DeVito plays the Penguin with a sadness but still as evil as every other comic book villain.  Christopher Walken's Max Schreck is calmly cool and sinister, but the one who steals the show is Michelle Pfeiffer as Catwoman.  You really feel sorry for her, and I may sound crazy, but she deserved an Oscar Nomination for it.The action is great and tense, and the fight scenes are well-done (considering the heavy 'batsuit' Keaton had to wear).

Let's get Nuts!!!,9,23 January 2016,"Well, a mutilated circus freak runs for mayor, Bruce Wayne learns that fishy swirl is supposed to be cold, Michelle Pfieffer becomes the leather fetish fantasy of a million school boys and Christopher Walken acts like he has no idea why he's here in this insane Batman sequel that is completely bonkers, but still awesome. After delivering a monstrous hit in 1989, Tim Burton was lured back in 1992, and despite McHappy Meal tie ins and big plans to make lots and lots of toys, he went and made a movie that was about as un-toyetic (a term I heard coined by Joel Schumacher) as you can get. We have a dirty joking sewer dwelling circus freak living with an army of penguins in the remains of Artic World, we have a woman wearing skin tight leather giving herself a bath by licking her suit and putting live canaries in her mouth (no seriously, Michelle Pfieffer actually had a live canary in her mouth during one of the scenes in this movie), we have Christopher Walken throwing secretaries out of the top story of his department store building and then offering to be covered ""up to his eyeballs in raw sewerage."" Then there's Michael Keaton tying bombs to people's chest and then laughing at them before punching them in a hole to explode. While I love this movie, it is not hard to see why the film company was a little annoyed with what they got given by director Burton here.We open 30 years in the past with Pee Wee Herman (Paul Ruebens) and Simone (Diane Salinger) as the Cobblepotts, an upper class Gotham City couple who give birth to a deformed son who, as well as having conjoined fingers resembling flippers, is also able to kill cats and eat them while a toddler. Not wanting the burden of raising a child with a lot of problems, they decide to dump him in a freezing river where he eventually gets discovered and raised by penguins. Fast forwarding to Modern Gotham, the little Cobblepott has grown up to be The Penguin, villainous leader of the Red Triangle Circus gang who start conducting series of raids on Gotham. In the meantime corrupt and opportunistic business man Max Shreck (Christopher Walken) is trying to get council approval to build a new power plant, that will actually act as a capacitor that sucks power and stores it (?)... Anyway, his secretary, Selina Kyle, a shy wallflower who lives in a crappy apartment and has relationship issues, finds out this confusing information and then attempts to black mail Shreck, who throws her out of the top story of his Department Store building, where she is revived by cats and goes insane, becoming Catwoman. After the accident, Selina meets Bruce Wayne and the two embark upon a much weirder, but somehow more engaging romance than Wayne had with Vicki Vale in the first film. Anyway Catwoman and the Penguin eventually work together to take on Batman while Shreck tries to get Penguin elected mayor. Everything goes wrong and the three of them end up trying to kill each other as they all converge upon Arctic world along with Batman for a final showdown which involves rockets strapped to penguins backs, a woman being shot 4 times, a man being electrocuted to the point of becoming a charred corpse, and another one with sewerage (or some other type of unpleasant green goo) oozing out of their mouth before dropping dead. Yeah. Kid's movie folks. Anyway, apart from being way over the top for the intended audience this is a wonderful world that Burton has created and he has populated it with some fascinating characters brought to life by great performances. Michelle Pfieffer is utterly fearless as Selina Kyle/ Catwoman. Hers is a riveting creation, dripping with sexiness and cynicism that we see echoes of in Anne Hathaway's Dark Knight Rises Selina Kyle 20 years later. In the case of De Vito, he is aided by a script that plays to his strengths, giving him all types of crudity and innuendo to spout, but it's worth nothing without the menace he brings with the way he carries himself and his line delivery. Michael Keaton approaches Wayne with the same brooding he did in the original, but once again gives frequent winks to the audience. Christopher Walken isn't really needed here, but he still brings something to the film by acting like you'd expect a normal person to act in these circumstances. He greets most of his scenes with a confused look on his face and a determination to dead pan and take it all in stride. There's so many other things that can be talked about here, I haven't even got into the look of Gotham or the minor players, but this is such a dense vision, so brilliantly realized in such a bonkers way, we'd be here all day. This is nuts. Absolutely nuts, but at the same time it's bloody brilliant. It's a shame Burton's vision alienated studios to the point this was the last time we would see him, or Keaton, but what a fun ride they gave us for two films! Batman Returns may not make a great deal of sense, but it is a rich, brooding, compelling and infinitely watchable film that I appreciate more and more as it ages. Arguably the best in the series and well worth a look more than twenty years on.",Batman Returns
189,nobbytatoes,fantastic squeal,9,29 August 2006,"It has been apart of all sequels to go bigger and better in an attempt to surpass or even match the original film. While many fail and fade away, their are those few sequels that hit all the right buttons and not surpass, but leaves the original behind. Tim Burton's return to the Batman franchise, takes it to an all new level.The first Batman, a classic in its own rights, is a dark, Gothic tale of revenge. The visual aesthetic has a distinct tone; dark heavy shadows with deep pastels. Batman Returns shows Burton evolving and changing Batman's world. Batman Returns is a dark, romantic fairy tale; with a more monochromatic style working to this tale. Returns does follow steps like all sequels with hard challenges, more villains, fights are more stylised and happen more often, but Returns goes even further to bring a more interesting story.Written by Daniel Waters, Batman Returns is better written and digs deeper into it's characters and reveals more layer in Bruce and Batman. Bruce still grapples with his parents death, but more focus on his love life and the problem he faces with his alter ego. Batman himself become more humane, falling for the wrong woman and hitting public despise. The villains themselves follow a different pattern. Penguin starts off as an animal with a hidden agenda, but he develops as he also tries to work into humanity and for people to accept who he is, and the forgiveness of his parents abandoning him as a child. Catwoman is one of the most interesting villains, as a sexy femme fatale. While she has a motive of revenge against Shreck, her ultimate goal is fun and exerting herself from her repressed and empty life.Doning the black cape again, Michael Keaton brings an even stronger performance as Bruce and Batman. Danny DeVito is amazing as Penguin, really bringing an ugly side to Penguin, not just visually. Michelle Pfeiffer is sexy and sassy as Selina/Catwoman. Christopher Walken is greatly vulgar as Shreck.One of the few sequels to surpass the original, Batman Returns is a fun dark tale.",Batman Returns
190,RiffRaffMcKinley,From Cat-Scratch to Kitty Litter & Flightless Birds of the Sewer,3,23 March 2008,"I get sick thinking about this movie. Really, seriously, legitimately sick to my stomach. It's either because it was really bad, or it had so much muck in it that cinema screens across America had to be scrubbed after showing it.Actually, it's both.This sequel to Tim Burton's groundbreaking 1989 version of ""Batman"" features the return of Michael Keaton as the Dark Knight. With Burton's trademark directorial style, there's bound to be some darkness. But not only darkness-- dankness as well! Danny DeVito, as the sewer-reared Penguin (there are penguins living in the sewer?), looks like an escapee from a low-budget toothpaste commercial. Michelle Pfeiffer, as the other villain, the kinky Catwoman, looks like she lost her way on the road to that elusive porn awards ceremony.Even the Joker's tumble into a vat of green acid was pleasant compared to the sickening imagery of this movie. Beyond the look and unsavory feel, the film dreadfully wastes such talent as Burton, Keaton, and Christopher Walken (of course, he visits the bottom of the barrel quite frequently) on a much more nauseating re-tread of the exact same shtick.The one main thing going for this movie is something it only acquired in 1997: the fact that it was nowhere near as bewilderingly awful as ""Batman & Robin.""",Batman Returns
191,tankace,Batman gets the Burton treatment.,7,22 July 2016,"Batman Returns is the sequel to the original 1989 film and because the previous film made almost twelve times its budget ,making one of the highest grossing movie of 1989, Warner Brothers gave to Burton free range to make the movie as he liked to. And here is why the movie has issues for Burton is a really good director in creating strange characters out of some idea and give it a Gothic beautiful style. But in adapting a character of a already existing source isn't his strongest suit and Alice in Wonderland is proof to that! Despite that I will say that it is a fine movie.So to anyone who has see it that is the reason why the Gothic and funny elements of the first film were cracked to eleven in this one. Now to the story it follows the new criminal called Penguin ,played by Dany Devito, who using black mailing tactics and allying with a corrupt business man ,play by Christofer Walker(!) of all people device a plan in order to take over Gotham and Batman has to (of course )stop them. While this plot is happening we also take the origin story of one of the most well known and loved( By men mostly ;)) anti-heroines of all times and main love interest of the Dark Knight ,Catwoman. Now Michelle Pfeiffer did a really good job portraying the sexiness and wildness of the character ,but let's be real here guys, this Catwoman is less and interesting character and more an loose woman in a skin tide leather costume, no offense to Pfeiffer I believe that you are a great person.Now apart from the strange sex under tones one other thing that ,this flick had it was that it is much more darker than the original. In the 1989 movie, yes it had the maniac the Joker, killings and Gothic image, but it was more like a Nightmare Before Christmas and less a horror movie. I don't know why but Burton did the reverse making is more horror flick and difficult to kids to watch. For real when I was ten I though that this film was a horror movie and I was afraid of it. And the design for Penguin, the criminals under his command and the streets didn't help either. So many parents didn't let their kids to go and watch the movie and for ones I don't blame them for it is more for teenagers than for kids.That had as a results the movie though it had more than twice of the originals budget it grossed far less and despite making almost 267 million this massive decline of gain made the studio to rethink who to make a Batman movie less Gothic and murdering and more friendly to children. Just for the record the 1989 film made a bit more than 411 millions so personally no matter what is send for the producer, if you had that facts in your had ,would you have similar ideas? But we all know how that went.",Batman Returns
192,jamiedarlow-37510,Still my favourite Batman movie!,10,3 April 2020,"One of my favourite films of all time partly for nostalgic reasons of watching it when I was a kid and being fascinated by its darkness but also that it is a perfect example of how to create a fully rounded villain as well as the hero. It's Christmas 1992; the rise of cooperate villain Max Shreck (Christopher Walken) is upon Gotham, who proves himself to be an unorthodox stepping stone for The Penguin/Oswald Cobblepot (Danny DeVito) and Catwoman/Selina Kyle (Michelle Pfeiffer). Bruce Wayne as well as his crime-fighting alter ego Batman must overcome great obstacles to protect Gotham. It's a darker and more emotional beast than the first and I think to have this much focus on the villains was a fantastic move. Although fans at the time of release did argue it lost the focus on Wayne, I think it delves into its theme of duality really well because of this and therefore makes Wayne an even deeper character also with another well-nuanced performance from Keaton. Stan Winston and his team perfectly create The Penguin's look which I think is one of the most beautifully unique designs of any film character. DeVito is astounding in the role and is a real career-best; the perfect combination of grotesque and cruel yet understandable with his deeply scarring psychological need to be accepted. The pre-credits scene is heartbreaking and initiates Penguin's story so well. Pfeiffer is wonderful as Selina; another of her greatest performances, a really rebellious role where we root for her to get her own back in the coolest stitched leather suit we're likely to see in cinema. Danny Elfman's beautiful music score is just.... phenomenal. It's my favourite of his whole catalogue and it's truly melancholy, epic and breathtaking! Well done to all the cast and crew for creating an original take on the Batman mythology with great visual and narrative content while also having a good gag now and again. 'I was their number one son... And they treated me like number two.'",Batman Returns

Keaton returns as Batman DeVito plays a disfigured penguin who wants to rule Gotham with the Help of Walken's ruthless tycoon. Pfeiffer plays her role as the love interest who takes more than a little interest in Bruce Wayne. The plots are so many though that they get lost in the shuffle..one could make a whole movie on Pfeiffer as the catwoman itself (Hmmm..not a bad idea?!?)...This is really a big budget f/x movie that while entertaining and lighter than the other one (the penguin's escape on a rubber ducky is almost comical) leaves you at the end with a ""eh"" feeling..

195,Brian-272,"A Thrill Ride From Start To Finish! Almost As Good As The Original Batman, But Not Quite, But Still One Of 1992's Top Movies.",9,25 June 2000,"Batman Returns is a explosively entertaining sequel that follows much the same pattern as the original Batman (1989). Tim Burton once again directs a dark moody film once again crafting expressionism and depicting Batman (Michael Keaton) as a dark but likable mysterious hero. The casting in Batman Returns is tremendous Danny DeVito fit the role of the Penguin perfect DeVito's physique was tailor made for the Penguin. Michelle Pfeiffer was aggressively stunning as the Catwoman and she unlike Kim Basinger provided great on screen chemistry with Keaton, Pfeiffer (Catwoman) simply has more in common with Bruce Wayne (Batman) both are mysterious and have two sides of life (split personalities) Basinger (Vicki Vale) was to fragile for a romantic interest of Batman. The Batman-Catwoman love interest doesn't last because we know a hero and villain can't be lifetime lovers. The Penguin (Devito) is a grotesque human-creature who wants to destroy Gotham City due to his abandoned childhood and failed mayor attempt. The Penguin unlike The Joker (Nicholson) is more of a violent destructive villain searching for the past as Nicholson's Joker was a homicidal killing likable clown who plagued Gotham with his joking killer art methods. The Joker also known as Jack Napier had a past connection to Batman remember the murder of Bruce Wayne's parents. Christopher Walken gives a good performance as the corrupt hated Max Shreck, but I felt that was immaterial because two villains were enough drama and excitement for Batman The Shreck character in my opinion takes away from the film. Batman Returns is second best in the Batman series trailing only the original all good performances from Keaton, DeVito, and Pfeiffer and good directing from Burton a great movie to watch many times.",Batman Returns
196,Donatien3,A Lasting Legacy,9,5 January 2021,"After 1989s ""Batman"" redefined comic book movies, the sequel raised the bar: it had a darker tone, multiple villains, a Christmas theme, and a brilliant cast, with Danny DeVito, Michelle Pfeiffer, and Christopher Walken joining Michael Keaton and Michael Gough.To its credit, ""Batman Returns"" doesn't muck around: the Penguin/Oswald Cobblepot's (DeVito) origin is dealt with in the opening credits (backed by Danny Elfman's beautiful score), and it's not long before Selina Kyle (Pfeiffer) transforms from mousy secretary to the badass Catwoman (and is somehow able to quickly match Batman in hand-to-hand combat).As well as the darker tone, it's one of the bloodiest mainstream comic book films of its time: Keaton looks more confident in the fight scenes, beating villains with little fuss, and he isn't afraid to blow up hapless henchmen with their own bomb. There's also a few scary-ish moments, like Max Shreck (Walken) pushing Kyle out the window, the Penguin biting someone's nose, and Catwoman electrocuting Shreck, not to mention the Penguin's overall grotesque appearance and leery behaviour.There's also a little bit of political intrigue, with Shreck helping Cobblepot to become mayor by trying to sabotage Batman, only for Gotham to turn on Cobblepot when his true motivations are revealed and Schreck abandons him. There's an overarching theme of duality, with Kyle romancing Bruce Wayne while fighting Batman, and the Penguin switching between his humanised Cobblepot persona and his more animalistic nature.While ""Batman Returns'"" legacy has lasted nearly 30 years, and cemented Keaton as arguably the greatest Batman ever (Keaton still brings out the iconic 'I'm Batman' line now and then, and half-jokingly calls himself the best Batman ever), the movie isn't perfect, and it's best not to think too hard about the plot.Unfortunately, the dark tone counted against it, as it scared suits who wanted to sell toys, resulting in the family-friendly ""Batman Forever"" and the horrendous ""Batman & Robin"". While Marvel started to make decent movies in the early 2000s, Batman wasn't seen again until 2005s ""Batman Begins"" gave the franchise a hard reset and a more realistic tone. Maybe this was a good thing: had B&R done well, the greedy suits would have demanded increasingly mediocre sequels every two years until audiences grew bored.As for ""Returns"", it deserves to be remembered as one of the best comic book films of the 90s, if not all time; it built on the first ""Batman"", pushed the envelope, and set the standard for darker superhero films.",Batman Returns
197,renegadeviking-271-528568,Batman Returns review,7,17 January 2020,"In the second Batman movie directed by Tim Burton, Batman faces not one but three villains: a corrupt businessman, the Penguin, and Catwoman.Like Batman, Batman Returns includes actors popular from the time period, in this case, the early nineties: Christopher Walken, Danny DeVito, Michelle Pfeiffer, and Michael Keaton.The successful businessman, Max Shreck (Christopher Walken), schemes to build a power plant for the future, though Gotham City is not facing and will not face a power shortage. In fact, the power plant is a front to suck the energy from Gotham City. The mayor-as well as Bruce Wayne, laws, and common sense-stand in the way of his nefarious plot. Shreck befriends the Penguin, running him as a mayoral candidate in a recall of the sitting mayor.Catwoman continues a societal critique that Vicky Vale's character started in Batman, reflecting the changing view of women in society. Catwoman represents the new woman who challenges the status quo and men. She is literally the product of the sexist attitudes of men who ignore women and see them as dispensable, stupid, and as objects.Michelle Pfeiffer plays the mousy secretary to Max Shreck. After speaking up in an important meeting, Selina is ridiculed (""my secretary isn't housebroken"") and then ignored-the stereotypical treatment of women in the male-dominated society of the early 1990s.Her transformation into Catwoman is a transformation of the role of women. Initially Selina is the damsel in distress that Batman saves and the jilted lover than laments not letting her boyfriend win at racquetball.As Catwoman, she is no longer soft-spoken; she takes control. In a battle with Batman, she matches him blow for blow, cashing in at the male inability to fight back. (Men aren't supposed to hit women.) She also attempts to dominant him sexually.The men in Batman Returns play the traditional roles, from the Penguin who is irate at interpreting the Catwoman as leading him on and then shunning him to Bruce Wayne who tries to save he women he encounters only for the women to end up dead or ""deeply resentful"". The role of women is no longer to be the plaything of men or the damsel to be saved.Report this adCatwoman is depicted as a woman gone bad, and by extension feminists or women who challenge societal bounds are being told to go back to being good. Out of the three villains, Catwoman is the one who got away...with one life left out of the nine she had.I did not expect the Batman movies to be such societal commentary on the role of women and the relations between men and women. The movies are an intriguing look back at changes to both in the late '80s and early '90s.",Batman Returns

To say that it is dark film is rather silly in my opinion: everything looks like it was made of cardboard and everything looks fake and harmless. The main villain is rather pathetic and doesn't appear to be serious in any part of the film. Overall, a quite entertaining film but nothing that one could call: a dark masterpiece, as some people had said before about this film.

Thought Danny Devito did more with the character and script than Nicholson did with the joker but that could be attributed to his appearance and perverse nature.
The Romantic tension that was supposed to exist between Catwoman and Batman just wasn't there though Burton tried to depict it.
Nothing dark again totally ridiculous with the army of armed penguins and Biblical comparisons to the tenth plague and Moses in a wicker basket.. just ridiculous... More ridiculous is a scattered brain secretary being brought back to life by street cats...
Christopher Walken the most diabolical character was overlooked in this movie. He can't change a lame script or story line, but he managed to imbue the cold greedy sociopath hiding behind the ""Respectable Businessman""",Batman Returns
201,NightmareOnElmStreetFan,"Average Batman sequel to the original 89th classic. Dark, violent fantasy that is set on Christmas Eve but still not better than it's predecessor.",5,26 September 2019,"Average Tim Burton's Batman sequel to the original 89th classic hit. It is not better than the original 89th Batman but a Hughe step down. I like this film I don't love it like I love the original. Batman Returns is a violent, comic book, dark fantasy set on a Christmas Eve. This movie get's a lot of hate but dosen't deserve it. Because it is diferent people doesn't like it? They bash this film and they don't appreciate it. I prefer 89 Batman, The Dark Knight, Batman Begins and Batman Forever over this film, but that is just me.Michael Keaton, Michael Gough and Pat Hingle all reprise their roles from the first film. Danny Elfman still returned with his music score. The movie has action, fantasy and dark Gotham City world. Characters are kinda out of place. The Penguin and Catwoman are still portrayed by the comic books just Tim Burton made a twist in those 2 villians and he changed the facts.Big + are for the positives: Batman is still in action, he fights off Catwoman which is good choreographed. But the stunts for Catwoman was not Michelle Pfeiffer but Kathy Long a kick-box champion did the stunts for the actress. Batman still fights off Penguin's henchmans. I like when Penquin kidnaps Ice Princess (Cristi Conaway) and he throws her off the roof with umbrella of bats those stunts and that sequence were excellent. The movie has good effects, good puppetry. Batmobil is still good designed and excellent. The make up for the Penquin took almost 2 hrs on Danny DeVito. I read he wasn't allowed for 4 hrs to go out of his trailer anywhere and talk to people. Good custums deigned for Catwoman. Good custum for Batman like in the first one this one was great custum designed.Michael Keaton is still fabulous as Bruce Wayne / Batman his performance is charming and excellent. Love Keaton's performence. Michelle Pfeiffer as Selina Kyle / Catwoman: Is still good. Selena Kyle is portrayed by comic books. Watch Gotham I loved the first four seasons and Selena was portrayed by the actress Camren Bicondova and she portrayed Selena Kyle believable. Selena was really pushed out of window and cats really awekend her and she went on a revenge spree and she made a catwoman's custom her self. In Ghotham Selena was pushed by Bruce's clone and cats aweken her. In this movie she was pushed by Max Shreck (Christopher Walken). Selena was shot in end of Season 4 Gotham and in Season 5 she was looking for revenge like she was in this movie. Oswald Cobblepot (Danny DeVito) really was mayor in Gotham city, he was mayor in Gotham and he was mayor in this movie. Catwoman and Penguin were portrayed by comic books in my opinion. Batman was still a cape crusader.Negatives - for this movie are: Selina Kyle was not a secretary or assistent in comics she was in actually a wise kid grown up on a streets and turned out to be a thief. In this movie she was a normal working girl. Catwoman engaged in sexually suggestive activities. That was the problem she wasn't romantic involved with Bruce in this movie enough. I still can't believe a grown woman goes and destroys her own pets at home acts like a child.. Demolish her home was Selina a psychopath in this movie to do that? I really don't like this. It is not entertaning. Penguin was nothing but a fat guy and ugly, he was terrible villian in this movie. He eat raw fish and he bite some guy's nose. Batman is barely in the picture. The fight scenes for Batman are not that great choreographed they could have been better. The music songs are not from Prince in this movie. I don't like Batman demolishes his beloved Batmobil. Max Shreck was not based on a comic book, he is a fictional character. Those points I don't like in this movie these mistakes hurt the film.I like the soundtrack Face to Face by Siouxsie and the Banshees when Selina and Bruce are dancing. My favorite scene in this movie is when Batman comes to save Ice Princess but Catwoman attacks him and Batman knocks her down and says ""Eat the floor."" that was the best scene and Batman flys to his Batmobile and sees all those bats. Michael Gough was excellent as Alfred who supports Bruce in his hard times. In my opinion Michael Gough was much better and more likeable Alfred as Michael Cain in my opinion. I like the explosion sequence in the zoo practical effect.Beside those problems I have it is a good movie I am still going to watch it. Come out the same year as Basic Instinct with Sharon Stone. I would say back in the 90's Sharon Stone and Michelle Pfeiffer were the most top sexy woman by actresses ever. I like this sequel, but 89 Batman, Batman Begins , Batman Forever The Dark Knight and The Dark Knight Rises are better movies in my opinion. P",Batman Returns

203,ReelCheese,Burton Elevates It Over Its Flaws,8,10 September 2006,"Director Tim Burton's wonderfully whimsical style helps elevate this memorable sequel over many of its flaws. Michael Keaton returns as the Caped Crusader, this time called upon to halt a criminal alliance between The Penguin (Danny DeVito) and Catwoman (Michelle Pfeiffer). The former is a grotesquely deformed sewer inhabiter with newfound political swing; the latter a sexy woman in black leather out for vengeance and aimless destruction. As different as they are, they do have something in common: a desire to rid Gotham City of Batman once and for all.The biggest beef one might have with BATMAN RETURNS is its excessive darkness and grim feel. People who watched the original BATMAN expecting a lighthearted superhero crusade were doubly surprised this time around. There is also a notable lack of the title character, who seemingly makes too few appearances throughout the 126-minute running span. But this is all mostly forgivable. The action scenes are highly entertaining without being over-the-top (Burton really should do more action... he's so good at it). Our black-rubber-wrapped antagonist has much more of a presence than he did last time. The film is so well-scripted, with interesting subplots of the Penguin's political power and Batman being framed, that the hero's limited screen time doesn't diminish the film.There are other things to like. The Penguin's circus gang make for some interesting fodder (though his deadly penguins armed with rockets were a little much). As usual, Burton delivers a striking backdrop, as Gotham City, seen here around the snowy holiday season, is breathtaking. The performances are solid, with Keaton able to carry the movie in the absence of Jack Nicholson's Joker. DeVito proved a perfect choice for the diminutive Penguin as he creates a complete maniac who can still draw much of our sympathy. Not to be outdone is Pfeiffer, who is superb as the hapless Selina Kyle and her tempting yet diabolical alter ego. And the element of romance, known to drag down many good-vs.-evil adventures, is a complement here given who is involved (Bruce Wayne aka Batman and Kyle aka Catwoman, but you already knew that).It's not entirely fair to compare BATMAN RETURNS with its predecessor because they are in reality two very different films. This one wins out in many areas, yet comes up short of the original in others. No matter what you think of this sequel, you won't be bored.",Batman Returns
204,undeaddt,Even better than the first original Batman (1989).,8,30 April 2018,"Maybe I will go a bit to far, but this movie, for me, is even better than it's predecessor. Yes, in the first movie Jack Nicholson's Joker is outstanding, his role is beyond great, he is the icon of the movie, but still, nothing is darker than this sequel. Here we have more than one main bad guy, we have The Penguin, The Catwoman and also Shrek, the businessman. The Penguin played by Danny DeVito is something else, it is beyond good, it is something that can never be replayed. The costume work done both for The Penguin and The Catwoman is pure art. What can I say about the Catwoman played by Michelle Pfeifer ? The best female semi anti-hero ever played on the movie screens ? She does everything in this movie with a feeling of crazyness, power and emotion, all three at the same time. There is nothing do discuss about Michael Keaton as Batman, he has already proven himself in the first movie, altho he is even better and a more complete character in this sequel. Also the city is once again beautiful, dark, gothic, cold and full with criminals, one of the most beautiful aspects of the movie. 8/10",Batman Returns
205,stormhawk2021,Dark Knight is back,8,12 July 2017,"Once again, the performance of the villain is superior to Michael Keaton's moderate portrayal of Batman. This time, our main foe is the Penguin, played by none other than Danny Devito. His performance makes him almost as sophisticated and disturbing as Nicholson's Joker. With Christopher Walken as a supporting role, it makes it seem that this is a superb sequel. However, I felt that Michelle Pfeiffer's performance as Catwoman was more focused on being seductive, rather being a clever feline thief. Overall, it doesn't feel superior to the predecessor, but remains as entertaining.",Batman Returns
206,tburke85,Batman Returns A Decent Sequel But With Flaws,6,27 March 2010,"Batman Returns is a decent sequel but with some of the same flaws that were in the first one by Tim Burton. I re-watched the original and this one after seeing writer/director Christopher Nolan's take on the popular comic book character with Batman Begins and the Dark Knight which are so much better than Burton's no offense. Director Tim Burton does an okay job making this sequel but some problems weigh it down which I'll get into later. Michael Keaton reprises the role of Bruce Wayne/Batman whose decent as the character but he isn't as good as Christian Bale in my opinion. He wasn't able to bring the presence Bale brought to the character. Keaton however does what he can with what very little he was given. Danny Devito had a little more to work with as The Penguin and he's okay despite shouting a lot of his lines. DeVito is a good actor but this isn't his best performance. It maybe because I just don't find the Penguin that interesting of a villain but DeVito still turns in a solid performance none the less as the short grotesque and deformed enemy of the Dark Knight. Michelle Pffiefer fared much better as Selina Kyle/Catwoman turning in a solid performance as the dangerous femme fatale. Burton probably should have chosen just one of them to be the villain for this film because their story arcs felt rushed at times because Pfieffer does an impressive job with her role. Well done. Christopher Walken does his best as Max Shreck a psychotic businessman who helps The Penguin run for mayor. Walken sort disappears for much of the second half only to reappear for the third act but he's okay in the role. The rest of the cast are so-so but none of them are memorable. Michael Gough as Alfred and Pat Hingle as Commissioner Gordon have what amounts to a few extended appearances which is disappointing because their characters could've been handled much better. They both do what their roles require I guess though. The action sequences are well executed but none of them are exciting or intense as the ones in Batman Begins or The Dark Knight. The dialog was once again cheesy at times and many characters like Harvey Dent for one aren't even in it or mentioned making their appearances in the first one seem totally pointless. Like Burton's first Batman one of the biggest problems is that this sequel seemed to focus mainly on the Penguin and Catwoman instead of the title character himself especially in the first hour. Keaton doesn't even show up until over 12 minutes into the film. He makes a brief extended appearance with very little dialog for an action sequence and then his character disappears until almost 40 minutes into the movie since most of the beginning centers on The Penguin and Selina Kyle's Catwoman. For a while it seemed Keaton has a cameo in his own movie which didn't help in the long run. After that initial first 40 minutes luckily he's in it more but Keaton seemed to get cheated out of some more much needed development and screen time again. I didn't realize just how little these films actually focused on the Dark Knight until I decided to recently re-watch them. It's always not a good idea to focus more on the villains than the main character because he's the one the audience is going to care about. I thought this problem was solved with Batman Begins and The Dark Knight because at least those films focused much more on Bruce Wayne/Batman especially Begins. The Dark Knight felt like an ensemble piece and by the end I think Bale got just as much screen time as the late Heath Ledger, Aaron Echkhart, and Gary Oldman. That film focused on the four of them evenly giving all four actors plenty of moments to develop their characters and shine. Overall Batman Returns isn't that bad of a sequel it just could have been better. I recommend Batman Begins and The Dark Knight to any fan of the comic book character because both films are entertaining fast paced action crime dramas and worth the time to watch. Batman Returns had potential to be a good sequel only it ended up being somewhat of a letdown compared to Nolan's two superior films on the Cape Crusader. Yeah it has some cool action, a little dark humor, and solid performances by the cast (Keaton, Devito, and especially Pfeiffer) but I just wish the film itself was a lot better than it turned out to be. I'd chose Nolan's two Batman movies any day over this one.",Batman Returns
207,The_Core,The best Batman...,8,12 November 2000,"To me, this was the best of the Batman series.  A storyline of much greater complexity and interest than the original, a much better-looking Gotham City, and the interactions between the Penguin (bird) and Catwoman (cat) are cute and funny.  Both Keaton and DeVito turn in great performances, Pfeiffer's has been better but not too shabby.  I really liked this movie, and didn't care much for any of the other (modern) Batman movies.  The first is probably second-best to this one, and after that the series just went off the edge of the cliff.  8/10.",Batman Returns
208,AndreiPavlov,Unlike other follow-ups of the saga this one is artistically and atmospherically superb,10,5 February 2008,"What I extremely like about ""Batman"" (1989) bounces back again in ""Batman Returns"": schizophrenic characters (in ""Batman"" there were at least two super-schizophrenics - I shouldn't name them, should I? - but here there are distinctive three of them), enchanting atmosphere (the sets are beautiful, ""gothically"" menacing, and simply outstanding), cool acting (when I say ""cool acting"" I mean my absolute inability to poke finger at the characters with disrespect and contempt; quite the other way round: I do respect all the characters here, while they are never goofy, stupid, or over-sentimental), great action scenes (fighting against the hordes of clowns, great acrobatic stunts - I am especially happy with that scene where clowns are jumping onto the Xmas tree and bring havoc to the streets of Gotham, effective explosions, insane killing sprees, etc.), sharp black humour which reminds me of ""Hamlet"" (remember the trio wild chemistry?), fine music (it is far from being some monotonous junk or over-imposed opera pieces) and tons of other minor ""Easter eggs"".By the way, I had a chance to watch ""Batman Begins"" one day - is it supposed to be good? No way, it is clumsy. They ruined the whole concept one more time. Why do people go for those ""zero copies""? Wasn't ""Batman and Robin"" enough? I respect Mr Tim Burton for quitting the ""Batman"" project after this film. He's done more than enough for making the figure of on-screen Batman legendary. And when you think about comics as the source for the movie, you get the idea: this film is a damn impressive achievement.10 out of 10 - it is as good as the original. Thank you for attention.",Batman Returns
209,CriticsVoiceVideo,Too boring.,4,20 July 2021,"Too boring, too slow, too long, too goth, and too Tim Burton. Could barely stay awake. Thank God Joel Schumacher took over.

210,mirosuionitsaki2,Ridiculously Awesome,8,21 December 2009,"Catwoman, Batman, Penguin Man, all three separate plots that somehow join together to create this very awesome, awesome movie. The effects were much better than the original Batman from 1989 with the Joker, but hey, the sequel can be the better one sometimes. Things were brighter than usual, and hey, look at that, Christopher Walken. What a disturbing looking man, who would have known that he would have been the bad guy? Quite a sarcastic guy, am I? Well, what's the plot? Catwoman emerges from a woman the guy Christopher Walken throws her out the window. Couldn't ever really catch his name. Her name is Selena, though. Apparently, she has 9 lives like a cat, but I'm not really sure that's a joke. Then, there's penguinman whom you're going to hear about in the beginning of the movie. The gloves from the sewer made me think this movie was going to be about Poison Ivy, but it wasn't. He actually runs for mayor. Pretty stupid, but hey, it works.This is a masterpiece in itself, and you're going to really enjoy it.",Batman Returns
211,TheHande,Two words: Christopher Walken,8,20 July 2006,"Batman Returns is still considered by some to be the very best Batman film. I heavily disagree even if it is slightly better than its predecessor. The film is also considered the darkest in the series, even though others claim it to be quite campy. Both sides are right to a degree.Once again, the thing I hate about Burton's Batman films is very evident. Burton once more fails to create an illusion of space with every scene obviously taking place on a stage. Keaton puts his best foot forward as the dark knight, but you can't blame me for thinking that Val Kilmer and George Clooney both looked better as Batman.While the film certainly is dark thematically, there is a bunch of really goofy scenes that make it a rather weird mix. I had no problem with the Penguin, but I never enjoyed the film's portrayal of Catwoman. In the comics she's sophisticated and hot. Here she comes of as psychotic and kinda unsanitary.Even with its faults the film is quite amusing, and you can't really hate a film that has Christopher Walken in it. The guy can be funny, even when wearing a ridiculous wig.",Batman Returns
212,fjhuerta-2,Tim Burton returns!,9,13 August 2000,"Excellent movie! Second only to the first one, it has a degree of lunacy matched only by ""Mars Attacks!"" also by Tim Burton.Many people feel that this is not as good as the first one mainly because of the lack of a character as powerful as The Joker. Although this might be right, IMHO it only makes this movie a different mix of values than the first one. It has the trademark darkness and psychological paradigms of the first one, but with a slightly sick twist: human oddities play a powerful role in the movie. The last of the ""real"" Batman movies, it is a must see for the sewer scenes and the ""flight"" over the abandoned zoo. A great movie by any standard.",Batman Returns
213,Chalice_Of_Evil,...Meow.,7,12 August 2008,"You know those films you watched when growing up, that you thought were SO amazing, but when you go back and re-watch them, you realise they're not all they're cracked up to be? Well...this is one of those films. It's the very definition of ""style over substance"". Sure, it LOOKS great, and yes, it *does* have a memorable theme provided by Danny Elfman, but having said that...there's still plot holes aplenty (big enough to drive a Batmobile through). Where to begin? Let's start with the obvious ones: Since when are their penguins living in the sewers? How does a mutant baby penguin-child survive in said sewers, and where in the WORLD does he find both goons and high-tech gizmos exactly? Let's not even get into the part involving penguins with rockets on their backs. Seem unlikely? Not half as unlikely as a lonely secretary (sorry...ASSISTANT) getting shoved out of a high-rise building, plummeting to her apparent ""death"", only to be brought back to life by a clutter of cats (who appear from seemingly nowhere) via some sort of bizarre cat ritual that involves them jumping over her prone body and chewing on her fingers. This results in her being turned talcum powder white, acting like a zombie and then going all ""crazy"" at home (her poor stuffed animals meet a grisly end in the garbage disposal). Despite having ""died"" and then resurrecting, she still manages to create an entire home-stitched dominatrix catsuit (complete with cowl and gloves) out of a single black vinyl jacket. She both feels and LOOKS ""so much yummier"". Her resurrection also granted her martial arts skills, the ability to wield a whip with expert proficiency and the urge to randomly blow up buildings. Resurrection via kitty bite RULES! I guess feline saliva has some amazing properties in it? Kitty spit is made of AWESOME.Catwoman's not the only one to defy death, though. The Penguin manages to survive his entire sewer lair collapsing on him long enough to drool black-green goo and deliver some lame last line before he falls down dead (finally!) and is miraculously carried into the water by his army of penguins. This is, of course, after he's managed to not only convince all of Gotham that he's some sort of ""hero"" who just wants to find out about his heritage, but somehow be in the running for Mayor. I guess it's not *that* hard...when it appears that all of Gotham are grade A morons. Didn't they learn anything from the Joker? I guess the Penguin's just smarter than the average Gothamite (he *does* somehow acquire the technology needed to deactivate Batman's Batmobile armour and tamper with it after all. Not to mention he has a vast array of trick umbrellas - talk about fancy technology. He hooks the handle of one of these special umbrellas - that doubles as a mini helicopter - around Catwoman's neck and sends her her up, up and away at one point...simply for rejecting his icky advances. I felt sorry for Catwoman there, but on the plus side, she got to fly over Gotham City's skyline and see the sights).Someone whose the total opposite of that^ and is completely incapable of having fun is Batman himself. Bruce Wayne just sits in his dimly-lit mansion, in a constant state of broodiness, doing absolutely *nothing* until he sees the Bat-Signal in the sky - at which point he's all pursed lips and dramatic head-turns. What a boring Batman! You'd think he'd be playing poker with Alfred at least, but no, he's just waiting for the signal, in a constant broody mood. When he puts on the Bat-suit, however, his mood shifts to...glum. Seriously, his mouth is turned downwards (when he's Batman) to such an extent that it looks like a muppet mouth. His Batmobile - which you can tell was solely designed with the idea of what a great toy it'd make for kids in mind - is ready for ANY occasion. Why should Penguin be the only one with unbelievable technology? As far as the actors go, Keaton doesn't have much to do besides scowl. DeVito is pretty nasty in his Penguin make-up and gives a nicely creepy performance. Walken (as Selina's tycoon boss, Max Shreck) and his crazy grey hair - which looks like the result of too much electricity - is the very definition of ""arch"". He actually twiddles his fingers in an evil manner at one point. ALL the characters spout cringe-worthy dialogue at some time or another, with varying degrees of success.The one who comes out on top, of course, is Miss. Selina Kyle herself - Michelle Pfeiffer. She is the definitive Catwoman, no matter what anybody else says. Yes, her origin story may vary from that of the comic book character or whatever, but it's of little importance. Pfeiffer exudes sexiness. She rises above the movie's shortcomings to bring us a memorable villainess/anti-hero, who encourages women to stand up for themselves, by gum! She makes the transformation from lonely, frustrated, slightly bumbling secretary (who gives us monologues - out loud - about her love life...or lack thereof), into a back-flipping, whip-cracking (and sometimes jump-roping), stun-gunning dominatrix capable of fitting an entire canary in her gob (I wonder how the bird managed not to suffocate in there?) - and you can't help but love every minute of it. Even when she rather foolishly lets herself get shot multiple times - just to prove a point - but soldiers on, rhyming as she does so. Shreck finally has a reason for his hair looking like that of the Doc's (from Back To The Future) there at the end, when there's some sparkage between him and Selina. Pfeiffer completely owns the part, and it's a relief to see her pop up into frame just before the credits roll (somehow having repaired her cowl - which had previously had holes in it that bits of her wild mane stuck out from). Meow indeed.",Batman Returns
214,Mitch-38,Nice Try,4,27 January 2001,"Undeniably weaker entry in the second installment of this series of films. The production values are still high, yet the execution came off weak. This is unfortunate, as BATMAN RETURNS had everything going for a worthwhile sequel. You had the stars...righto! You had Tim Burton...righto! You had the great supporting cast, musical score and those effects...righto! You had the screenplay...UH-OH....The story really did come off as one long homily about not looking down on people that we perceive as different. I can relate and think that is fine, but not for the length of the movie. Besides, I'm not ready to start thinking that all six billion of us on the planet need to be told such lessons in such a heavy handed nature. The character development came off as trying to fit too much, in one setting. The Penguin's character, in trying to be scary, degenerated into camp and became an object of humor. To see Devito's character traipsing about the underground sewers of Gotham, in those colossal, filthy undies bemoaning the fact that folks find him less than desirable, came off as somewhat ludicrous. Also, a question popped into my head while viewing this. If he spent all his time in the sewer, how did he eat? I mean the guy is tremendously obese. Who fed him? Ed Norton from ""The Honeymooners""? Also, I heard a rumor that penguins can be found in cold climates, like Antarctica, and generally not in our sewers. I realize this is supposed to be fantasy, yet let's not make simpletons out of the audience, please.The only saving grace in the whole shebang is Pfeiffer's Catwoman character. She basically stole the show, and is by far the most interesting character. Michael Keaton is solid, but like Danny Devito, are anchored down by the limited, innocuous scope of the script.  A small smudge off the neighbor's hibachi could have saved Warner Brothers a lot of loot, and the audience a lot of pain. This movie is by no means a dud, it merely means that with the right factors going, BATMAN RETURNS had the potential for a great film, instead of a so-so one. Recommended only for diehard fans, others should be wary of this weak fare.",Batman Returns
215,Old Joe,Batman returns in a freakish sequel,5,22 January 2002,"The `Dark Knight' returns, in what I would say was one of the most anticipated sequels in many years. But whether this film holds up to the same expectations than the original is in my view debatable.Gotham City faces two monstrous criminal menaces; the bizarre, sinister Penguin and the slinky, mysterious Catwoman. Can Batman battle two formidable foes at once? Especially when one wants to be mayor and the other is romantically attracted to Gotham's hero? Batman Returns is the follow-up to the first blockbuster, which is a dazzling adventure that will leave you breathless!Once again, we see Michael Keaton get out his costume as Batman/Bruce Wayne. The second Batman allows Batman to have more of the limelight, as the baddies aren't as dominant. Again Keaton is cold, callous and moody' as Batman. He suits the role and in my opinion is the best Batman for the movies. I was disappointed when he could not reprise the role for the later films. The  fighting scenes that Keaton did do in this film weren't bad.
Unfortunately, the baddies in this film probably aren't as good as the first film. Could anyone do any better than Nicholson? I think not. Danny Devito took on the hard role as the Penguin. It must have been difficult to walk, talk and act like that gruesome sort of character. In that way, I feel like applauding Devito. Yet his character wasn't that scary. The audience more pity him for the way his family discard him, more than feel threatened by him. But the role of Catwoman, played by the talented Michelle Pfeiffer, was remarkable. It was just like the comic book version had just leapt to the big screen. I loved it. Her sarcasm, her wit and her charm made Catwoman, someone you could love or hate in an instant. The storyline was interesting when it involved Selina Kyle and Bruce Wayne. The chemistry they bought to the screen was fascinating. Then as there alter ego, the relationship got even steamier. My favourite scene with Catwoman would have to be when she walks into a department store, defeats the security guards, then blows it up by placing gas cans into a microwave. To finish the scene she flips out and says `Meow'. Tim Burton returns as the director for Batman 2. I thought he got the Batman character correct the first time around, but this time he wasn't as accurate. The darkness in the film is probably a little over the top and makes the Dark Knight just a little bit too dark, yet the set is a pretty reasonable one. One of Burton's latest films Sleepy Hollow, starring Johnny Depp would be just as dark as this. So if you didn't like this movie I would recommend you stay away from Sleepy Hollow as well. I say that it would be an interesting film.  Undoubtedly, the best scene in this film would have to be when the Penguin's army of penguins are unleashed to Gotham Square to blow up the city. But of course Batman interferes and turns the Penguins around. The trainers involved in this scene must be commended on the precision they got every penguin to walk like they were supposed to. This must have taken many months of training to get just right. I enjoyed the second Batman movie. The storyline was ok and it did have some enjoyable scenes and I applaud the role of Catwoman. But this film never had the same impact on me like the first and I guess it was never going to. But, Pat Collins from  WWOR-TV said:-`Batman Returns was Sensational! A funhouse of comic and crazy surprises.'In my view many sequels are only made for the hell of it. The Batman genre (and other superheroes) can be included in that. What do you think?

216,Indy-52,flawed but fun movie,6,19 December 2001,"Just like the 1st Batman flick this one has an incoherent story that barely makes sense, but just like the previous film it has awesome production design, fun performances & action scenes. It is a bit mean spirited as a story, but I still liked it. The Penguin is a bit less fun a villain than the Joker (who wouldn't enjoy watching Jack Nicholson acting like a nut and having a ball collecting the hugest actor paycheck of all time?). There is almost nothing I can actually say in favor of this film, except that I liked it and enjoyed it. It's just as weird as every other Tim Burton film, so at least you'll know what to expect.",Batman Returns
217,Indy-52,the best Batman movie,6,24 March 2000,"this one i like better than its predecessor. It's again directed by Tim Burton who is, in my opinion, one of the best directors of all time. He shows us Gotham City as a very dangerous town. It's shown in a comic book-style even more than the first one. It is much more violent than the first one, and after this one, this series turned into a kiddie television series. They should've left with this one. The plot is a bit confusing and incoherent, but it always keeps your attention. This film never gets boring, see it if you haven't!",Batman Returns
218,Mr_Censored,"""I believe the word you're looking for is 'Aaahh'!""",8,31 December 2008,"Before ""The Dark Knight"" changed everyone's perception of what a Batman movie (or sequel, for that matter) should be, there was Tim Burton's ""Batman Returns,"" reaching sixteen years back to 1992. With perhaps the best cast of any of the original four Batman films (we're talking the Burton/Schumacher fare) and improved confidence by it's director, ""Returns"" is a rare occasion of a sequel one-upping it's predecessor. Sure, audiences failed to embrace it at the time in the way that they ate up 1989's ""Batman,"" but time has revealed this one to be the better film.As Burton states in the commentary track for the film, ""Batman Returns"" is less a sequel than it is another chapter in the Batman saga. And visually, the film reflects that. To match it's decidedly darker tone, Burton gives a much grimmer, much more realistic look for Gotham City than the comic-book look he gave the first. He immerses his characters in gritty darkness, whether it's The Penguin lurking in the murky sewers, or Bruce Wayne sitting alone in a darkened Wayne Manor waiting for the Bat-signal. Everything about the movie is much more adult, more mature and meaner than before, which played a big part of it's initial backlash. Afterall, it's hard to sell Happy Meals and action figures when a certain character in the film bites noses, feasts on raw fish and barfs black sludge. Therefore, it must be said that it takes a more adult audience to appreciate this film, and it's not something for children to be watching -- although I surely got my fill of this movie at the tender age of eight years old.The story, about about a deformed baby outcast from society by his own parents, who takes refuge in the sewers only to re-emerge as iconic villain/urban-legend, The Penguin is almost as depressing as the story of the meek bachelorette Selina Kyle who, after being pushed over-the-edge by her boss, is re-incarnated as the sexed-up, merciless Catwoman. Truth be told, ""Batman Returns"" feels more like a movie about the two villains than it does it's title character, as Batman (with Michael Keaton reprising his role) takes a back-seat role. Danny DeVito is natural as The Penguin, and not just in body-shape. This is a rare case of an actor disappearing into his role, and DeVito has hardly had a more interesting part since. Michelle Pfeiffer, on the other side of the coin, seems to be having fun with her character, and watching her in Catwoman makes one think that maybe she was more deserving of her own spin-off film, instead of the 2004 abomination that is ""Catwoman."" Christopher Walken has a role as b-villain Max Shreck, and really, what can be said about the guy? He's great in everything he does, and his portrayal of the heartless megalomaniac that drives the motivation of each respective villain is spot on.Overall, ""Batman Returns"" is a much more complicated film than the first. Those looking for a typical comic-book or superhero movie may find themselves disappointed in what they find here. However, like another, more popular Batman sequel in recent memory, it's a film that proves that Batman can be taken to extreme lengths and out of the context of his original format. It may feel more like a Tim Burton film than your average Batman flick, but it's also one of the best pieces of celluloid to feature the character. It's a movie that has gradually found it's audience over time, and surely, it's better than the two films that follow. This is, in my opinion, the only film prior to 2005 that gets the spirit of The Caped Crusader right.",Batman Returns

220,Ziya90,Tim Burton's vision,10,15 February 2010,"It seems that Tim Burton likes snow so much, because it snows in almost all Tim Burton movies. Owing to the set design and art direction, you may want to settle down in The Gotham City. However, of course the city is not pleasant always. The gloomy atmosphere, evil Max Shreck who does not know the value of his sweet, sensitive and too polite secretary, instead hates her and The Penguin who tries to ruin Batman's reputation, for example there is a Batmobile sequence, a nightmare for a child. Briefly, Burton gets you stroll in a city that is perilous but also wonderland. Batman is almost in every scene, not Bruce Wayne, Batman. I don't want to compare this with Nolan's movies, but just want to say a few things about both. This is the darkest Batman movie so far by the way. We see daylight very rarely. Batman encounters with Catwoman and Penguin many times and they square accounts with each other which is very important. Remember Two Face character's screen time in The Dark Knight. In the first action scene, we see Batmobile's tricks and want to have it as usual. In Tim Burton's Batman movies, the design of Batmobile is very stylish and appealing, despite my favorite is the one in the original animation series. You know, in Nolan's movies, they made a tank that kills the magic. The attack of the bats? Better planned and better directed than Batman Begins. The camera angles and the chaos in this scene are great. In The Dark Knight, people watched an uninspiring final fight between Batman and Joker and Joker's biggest plans were detonating two ships. In Batman Returns, yes, some people explode some places, but interesting, moreover the film has much more. Michelle Pfeiffer. Tim Burton is interested in details such as the appearances of the characters, their personalities, belongings, costumes and actions. At the beginnings, we see Selina's luminous house. She is a woman who is lonely, neglected, not well-cared for herself and waits for his prince. While observing this character, we don't think that she is a cliché character we have watched a lot of alike ones, may be because of Pfeiffer (and her acting), may be Burton's meticulous player direction, may be both. Moreover, Catwoman is not a typical character, she seems that she is a feminist, but in a scene, she injures a girl after rescuing her. It seems that she hates men, but she shows interest in Batman and also Bruce Wayne. Everyone knows that she was not comfortable in her costume, but remember pain brings victory :) Catwoman looks great in the movie. Danny De Vito with one of the most realistic, so one of the best make-ups ever made. It is impossible to believe that he is Danny De Vito. The scene he eats raw fish, the scene he drives his toy car and the scene he ambushes Catwoman are my favorites. All these things, details are not childish at all, even if they are for some people. Returning to Penguin, he is a cliché villain who hates humanity and whose purpose is destroying the city, killing all the people, but again, Tim Burton does not let us say cliché. With his multifarious weird accessories, weapons and actions, he is a character who is interpreted by Burton in great detail like Catwoman, Joker or Batman himself. Burton is like a detail expert. More than one enemy in a movie. This should not been a problem, but when Sam Raimi failed in Spider-Man 3 according to many people including me, then filmmakers and directors have been started to be afraid of doing that. Tim Burton allows enough time for both of the enemies and this works perfectly. We get to know their personalities, but also we watch them in many action scenes and still there are other characters and other stories like Max Shreck or we witness to Bruce Wayne's life, his relationships or the candidacy of Penguin and the effect he creates.",Batman Returns

222,David_Frames,"""Don't Bother!""",6,19 June 2005,"Burton returns as well as Batman and in doing so abandons any pretence of real story telling in favour of a retro-expressionist exercise in psychological damaged character study. Even the production methodology replicates the old studio constructivism of pictures made in Germany's Weimar Republic and its clear that you're looking at a sound-stage the entire time which if anything just heightens the sense that you're occupying a complete fantasy world, superbly realised but lacking in the subtleties of plot that would have made it a more complete experience. As it is the visuals are stunning and its a more technically accomplished, more confidently directed picture than its predecessor but for all that it lacks the unpredictable edge of Jack Nicolson's Joker or the epic scope of Anton Furst's sets, here replaced by some accomplished design by Bo Welch. Its rare for a studio to give a director as much latitude as Burton got here but there's an argument to say that he ran too far with his own vision as the sacrifice of story and the creation of a film with such a dark and foreboding centre made him an easy scapegoat for the movie's apparent under-performance at the cash registers. Burton may have got his own way but his inability to properly balance the material and propensity to over-egg the pudding produced an ugly reaction in the studio, Joel Schumacher. A shame because Returns is a perfectly watchable, occasionally brilliant instalment, it just doesn't quite work as comic book entertainment.",Batman Returns
223,johnny-08,Batman returned with style,8,17 May 2008,"After first Tim Burton 'Bat' movie we all expected second one to be if not better then at least equal to its predecessor. While ""Batman"" is mostly one man show (Jack Nicholson) coupled with capable direction of Burton; this one full field my every expectation and I think it is even better then the first and holds a nominee for best Batman movie ever made. Let me tell you why...""Batman Returns"" has a great story and every character is elaborated to tiny details. Batman's enemies are Penguin and Catwoman and by entrance of new and interesting characters ""Batman Returns"" gained only pluses. Here, I must say that all the cast done their job with no stains. Michael Keaton had tougher role then in first one and he passed the test. As always Batman movies is as good as the villain is. Danny DeVito in role of Penguin is amazing, just like Michelle Pfeiffer as Catwoman who had acting transformation from boring secretary to a deadly Batman opponent and love. If only makers of the ""Catwoman"" and Halle Berry watched what real Catwoman should be, maybe they wouldn't make one of the worst movies ever. To round this excellent casting I will mention Christopher Walken as Max Shreck. Classic staff and here Walken is memorable.But what movie would Batman be without dark genius, and my favorite director, Tim Burton. Burton created Gotham city that none of the directors after managed to copy (we've all witnessed on how low branches Schumacher took it and how Nolan tried to raise it from dead with success). So dark, creepy and atmospheric. He plays with light in scene where Walken decides to get rid off Pfeiffer, he creates mean Penguin with classic Burton bright side (benneath all he's a good person that is always abandoned from people). There he reminds me of Edward Scissorhands, another Burton's 'child'. So till now you've realized that I like this movie, cause it's a comic brought to life thanks to Tim Burton and his never ending creativity. He managed to round the picture with no holes and if you don't understand Burton's work then you probably won't be able to enjoy in this Batman fully. Cause this one has Burton signature all over it and now it's official that Batman returned with style.",Batman Returns

On the penguin's side is Max Schrek (Christopher Walken), a big business man. Batman's life becomes even more complicated when Catwoman (Michelle Pfifer) surfaces, who although a bad girl, stuns Batman.A visual nightmare that is not fun and eternally depressing again lets the villains steal Batman's thunder. The Penquin has way too much screen time, and Batman is AGAIN not developed correctly. There are also a few too many scenes that pulsate with unpleasantness (ie. the ""gushing blood moment"", and basically every scene with the penguin in it).Although the relationship between Bruce Wayne and Selena Kyle is perfect. If two people of the opposite sex decided to become hero and anti-hero, they would probably act like this around each other. the romance is a great way to combat all of the disgust in this film, although it is not enough.Danny DeVito is over the top, revolting, and gets way too much screen time. I would assume he was trying to make sure the audience hated his character, but it's just too much. it makes us grateful that Michelle Pfifer is in this film, decked out in a sexy, but not slutty, Catwoman outfit. Her acting is excellent.Micheal Keaton, my favorite batman, is cheated out of screen time again. he would probably be regarded by all as the best batman if Tim Burton and the screenplay writer had spent time developing more of his scenes.I recommend the film only if you want to see a beautiful relationship between two of the greatest characters ever to grace the comic book movie screen.**/****",Batman Returns

226,carologletree,An Excellent Sequel to a Classic Movie,9,6 January 2016,"This was the follow-up to the hugely successful 1989 film ""Batman"", and it was an excellent continuation of the Batman story.Michael Keaton gives another cracking performance as Batman/Bruce Wayne. He was a little more violent in this film with the way he killed a lot of the Penguin's goons.Michael Gough and Pat Hingle return, but there are also a bunch of new actors to the cast. The main villain is the Penguin, played by Danny DeVito. His portrayal of the Penguin is decidedly different from Burgess Meredith's Penguin from the 60's TV show. Whereas Meredith brought out the more comical side of the Penguin, DeVito plays a more tragic and grotesque version. He is creepy, but he also makes you really feel for him.Another villain in this movie is Catwoman, played by Michelle Pfeiffer. She is sexy as well as creepy, and the scenes between she and Batman are quite engaging. Christopher Walken plays Max Shreck, the other villain in the movie. Walken is one of my favorite actors, and as always, he was great in this movie.Tim Burton gives the movie the same unique visual style he gave to the first movie. There is a lot more action in this movie, and it is quite thrilling. The Christmas atmosphere is also really nice.You couldn't have asked for a much better sequel. While not quite as good as the original, it is still one of the best sequels out there.RATING: A-",Batman Returns
227,The_Orenda,What makes a sequel? More stuff.,7,20 June 2005,"Growing up, Batman Returns was one of my favorite movies as a child. It pains me slightly to watch it today, for what I thought then was flawless, is now rather over-the-top and melodramatic. But the production is beautiful and I will never forget Michelle Pfeiffer's Catwoman. At the time, I thought she was God's greatest, sexiest gift to mankind.Batman's back and instead of one headache, he now has three: the Penguin, Catwoman and Max Schreck.Everything about Batman Returns is about more. More explosions, bad guys, gadgets, decoration. It's all on a grand scale. Unfortunately the script is not up to snuff, but the makeup of the Penguin is excellent, and the costumes are excellent, especially the Catwoman's! I couldn't figure out if Christopher Walken even tried in his character or if he was truly necessary. Thankfully, the Gotham scenery and the other actors' efforts catapult it above ground.",Batman Returns
228,LuboLarsson,Its.....OK,6,11 January 2004,"Batman Returns is pretty good but not great. I thought Catwoman was great but didn't care much for the Penquin, he was just too.....weird. Michelle Pfeiffer is fab as Catwoman and really seems to be getting her claws into the role. I think I prefer Batman films to have one villain, two seems a bit too much as Batman seems to fade into the background as so much time is given to the villains. I preferred Burgess Meridith as the Penquin in the 60's TV show anyway. Batman Returns must be the weirdest summer blockbuster ever released, still its miles better than any of the Batman films that followed. Michael Keaton is good when he's on screen as Batman which doesn't seem that much, he's the best Batman so far thats for sure. Christopher Walken is always good and he's no different here his character reminded me a little of when he played Max Zorin in the Bond movie ""A View to a Kill"". All in all not bad, but I don't think I'd bother watching it again. ***6/10***",Batman Returns
229,vip-danii,One Of My Favourite Batman Movies!,10,23 March 2013,"Having just seen ""The Dark Knight Rises"", I have to say that ""Batman Returns"" is superior in several ways: Anne Hathaway's catwoman (or whatever she was supposed to be in TDKR), simply cannot compare to Michelle Pfeiffer's. The former is just one-dimensional, lame and unconvincing.""Batman Returns"" manages to capture the essence of Gotham City -- the atmosphere is magnificently portrayed (dreary, dark, depressing), which is more than I can say for TDKR, which tries very hard, but fails.I did kind of enjoy Bane in TDKR, but his character was severely under-developed and there was not much of a story behind the whole residing-in-the-sewers-for-years stuff. The Penguin in ""Batman Returns"" is well explained, the story revolves around the sewers, and a lot of the action takes places there.The costumes / the makeup alone are reason enough to see ""Batman Returns"" -- amazingly good! In TDKR, there's ABSOLUTELY nothing -- everyone (including Batman) look like they're wearing cheaply-made, lame Halloween costumes from one of those 1$ stores.The lead characters are well-developed and colourful -- even the supporting/minor characters. In TDKR, they are one-dimensional, bland, mostly unlikeable, and you just don't care for them much.I liked Christian Bale's Batman a bit better than Keaton's, though. The worst one, without a doubt, was Clooney's.",Batman Returns

232,C22Man,"Batman Returns, but he probably shouldn't have bothered",4,6 January 2015,"Batman Returns (well sort of) in the sequel to the 1989 smash hit. This feels much more like a Tim Burton project and much less like an actual Batman film. Batman is here of course, but he has a much more subdued role to play in proceedings and Returns likes to concentrate on its villains a lot more than it does on the caped crusader. It became infamous at the time due to many complaining about its violence and grim tone. Yet that's not the issue, the first film had a dark tone, as the problems lie with the storyline and the ideas the film tries to bring to life.Story: The bizarre story features the Penguin, deformed and abandoned as a child, rise from the sewers and attempt to become mayor of Gotham with the help of shady businessman Max Shreck. Elsewhere, Catwoman is created after Shreck attempts to kill his secretary and she causes havoc around Gotham. It's up to Batman to find out their plans and stop them. The plot is all over the place and makes little sense. It doesn't make sense why the Penguin would want to be mayor and Catwoman has no motivation to do what see does. Batman just seems to be shoehorned into things as the villains are given no reason to be against him and he barely gets any screen time, again this is meant to be Batman 'Returns'.Batman: Keaton returns and he's given very little to do here. His Batman is still enjoyably mysterious and brooding, even if he is too cruel. His Bruce Wayne is pretty dull and doesn't act like Wayne should, he's too awkward and not the charismatic playboy we should expect. There's not enough separation with both roles either, when he's Bruce he just acts like Batman without the mask. He doesn't get enough screen time to make a big impression and has no arch which just makes him feel wasted.Villains: Danny DeVito plays the grotesque Penguin and he's nothing like the Penguin should be. It's just a bad character, he's just a freak and has none of the wit or charm needed for the role. We don't feel sorry for him and we don't care about his plight because the character is unsympathetic. DeVito gets into the role and looks ideal, but that's it. Michelle Pfeiffer is having fun as Catwoman and looks fantastic, but once again this isn't the true Catwoman. She isn't a thief and her interest in Batman seems like it was thrown in at the last minute. As said, her motivations make little sense and she just isn't that interesting to begin with. A disgruntled secretary who wants to try to get revenge on her boss, it's pretty weak for a Batman film.Support: Christopher Walken is wasted as Shreck. He's a wonderful actor and could have been superb in a creepy role, but Shreck has no substance. If you took the character out then it wouldn't make much of a difference. Michael Gough is great again and is given a little more to do here which is nice. Pat Hingle is given even less to do than before and his Gordon is useless, he has about 4 lines and his relationship with Batman is non-existent.Action: Burton isn't great at shooting action and it shows here. The opening fight scene is clumsy and just has Batman letting the Batmobile do all of the work. The little fights with Catwoman are pretty daft and the climax just has things exploding which gets dull. The issue is that Batman does a lot of un-Batman things here. He sets some guy on fire, plants a bomb on another and throws acid at Catwoman. It's very distracting and so out of place.Music: Danny Elfman's score is easily one of the highlights of the film. It is a lot more subdued, brooding and darker than before with some wonderfully haunting melodies as well as some suitably upbeat stuff when needed. It perfectly fits the wintery, Gothic look that the film possesses. I'd go as far as to say that this is Elfman's best score.Production: The best thing about the film is its look. The cinematography is truly spectacular. The sets look aptly gloomy and some of the building designs look great, especially Wayne Manor. The idea to set it at Christmas is also really clever as we get many beautifully atmospheric shots of snow falling and the wintery landscapes. The scene at the party with Bruce and Selina is done well too. Yet, similar to the following two films the writing gets silly. I don't want to hear Penguin spewing sexual puns like there's no tomorrow and Batman looks dumbfounded far too much (just look at his failure to save the Ice Princess). It too out of character and it's hard to know what the writers were thinking. There's no big set-pieces either here which harm the film. The opening with the Penguin as Moses is flat and nothing exciting happens in the climax. Conclusion: At the end of the day Batman Returns is a very flawed film. It has good elements as the look it goes for is wonderful and the score is brilliant, but it has so many daft parts. People point the finger at Schumacher but there's a lot of campy stuff here. A lot of people claim that the film is too dark, but I think that's it just too strange and daft for its own good. Most of the acting is iffy, the plot makes no sense, the action is uninspired and Batman is just a background player in his own film. At least Forever knew it was light and ran with the idea, if this is a serious Batman interpretation then something is very wrong.",Batman Returns
233,Kakueke,Penguin an albatross,3,22 November 2001,"Batman II is a disappointment.  Actually, a better word is gross.  There is really not much more to say about Danny DeVito's Penguin, operating in sewers, grotesque and crunched in features.  By contrast, Burgess Meredith was amusing, carried himself well -- actually, I think he was my favorite Batman TV villain, aside from Julie Newmar.  DeVito is shorter, squatter, grosser, uglier.  Apotheosis:  biting the journalist's nose, just great. The storyline for his part was too complicated, the cinematography too dark and pompous.  The only good thing at all was the attempt at the someone sympathetic look at him based on his origins, but this dies as the rest is just garbage (sometimes literally).  Michelle Pfeiffer partially redeems the movie as Catwoman, and her sympathetic storyline is thus enhanced some.  In contrast to his role in the battle against the Penguin and company, in which he is almost a footnote, Batman (and Bruce Wayne) square off against Catwoman, a sympathetic, modern-woman villainess.  Keaton, however, still seems not to quite measure up, overall presence, monotone or whatever.  Thus, he was told, skip it next time.Regardless of some good Catwoman moments, a so-so Batman and an abominable Penguin man have the overriding aura in this film.  No ride into the sunset, or the moonlight, but into the abyss.",Batman Returns

Batman Returns feels like it was ripped straight off the comic book panels and brings a new light to overlooked Batman villains.
This film brings in both The Penguin and Catwoman. Both being played by, what I would say, perfect casting with Danny DeVito and Michelle Pfeiffer respectively. Good god I was impressed and loved both of their performances.

241,emilie8605,great batman!,9,10 January 2004,"batman returns is a really great batman movie.  i never saw the batman with jack nicholson in it, but that's ok, because if you didnt see that this batman sums it up.  michael keaton does a great job as the leading bat, and does manage to maintain a higher glow of male sexuality dripping all over in his batman suit. rumors were that the catwoman was to be played by someone else, but i dont remember the womans name. i saw her on vh1 because she and the director tim burton got into a quarrel about why she wasnt wanted for the role.  i saw the woman on the show, and she couldnt have done what michelle did for the role.  if the woman who played her in the 60's could have seen her acting, she would have been proud. great makeup on the penguin, (**SPOILER**) especially when he bites off a nose, that was really gross but added to the dramatic effect of the evil hero.  the plot, of course, comes from a comic book, and does have some rather stupid points. but, batman was quirky, originally, with all the bat gadgets and stuff. i think all three of them combined in a huge way, making the movie a success. for all you batman fans out there, this is a must see for you.  A fair word of warning, ladies, you wont be the same when you see michael running around town in the batman uniform.  (A A-)",Batman Returns

Unlike the Joker, you see that Catwoman and Penguin were once put upon human beings before something happened to them to make them lose it. Michael Keaton reprises his roll as Batman and, as in the first movie, does an excellent job in conveying his inscrutable dark brooding intensity. Michelle Pfeiffer as Catwoman? Excuse me while I take a cold shower. Danny DeVito does almost as well as Burgess Meredith in his roll as the Penguin.

None of the villains are as good as Joker in the first film, but they're still fun. Danny DeVito is delightfully over the top, but it's Michelle Pfieffer's Catwoman who is the best villain. She has a legitimately strong motivation as well as being really entertaining to watch. I didn't mention the score in the last review, but it's really good across both of these films. Burton's direction is still good, and the story is actually better than the first film, with way less of Batman shooting people (although he does kill a couple people so it doesn't even really fix that problem). My big issue with the film is that I really didn't like the ending. It felt quite rushed given how it was built up, and the action doesn't really do the rest of the film justice. It also recycles the Bruce-Vicky relationship from the original, just replacing Vicky with Selina Kyle. Overall, it's really enjoyable, but nothing compared to The Dark Knight Trilogy in my opinion.",Batman Returns

248,ihrtfilms,So much better than the first Burton Batman outing,8,5 September 2010,"Three years after Batman Tim Burton was back with the caped crusader and what a difference a holiday makes. Batman Returns is very different from the first outing. Firstly it oozes Burton, the musical score that plays from the very outset is very reminiscent of other Burton films, it has that element of fantasy and whimsy to it.The style of the film is different. Gotham City is no longer dark and ominous, but more lighter, there's more colour and the sets and back drops seem to work better and look more realistic. That adds a much more enjoyable element to the film and makes it more watchable. But there is more to like in this film. The villains are fantastic in this. Danny DeVito is brilliant as the creepy deformed Penguin, his performance is so good, combining a dark character with hints of DeVito's comic side. Michael Keaton returns in this sequel and he's good, but again he has little to do really. Christopher Walken also does a good job, but he is less Walken in this and that seems a shame. However the stand out here is Michelle Pfeiffer. Playing the hard working secretary who is reborn as Catwoman, she is brilliant. The contrast between the Selina and Catwoman is perfect, with her Catwoman being sexy, sly and full of wonderful lines; the scene where she says 'Meow' before the building blows up, may be the best delivered singular word line in movie history! There are wonderful fight scenes between her and Batman that touch on the campness that can be found in the TV series and Batman gets to play with some more toys and vehicles. The Penguin's mob and the theme of Freaks and circus's also work well and also show the Burton mind at work.It's amazing how different the two films are and how much better and more enjoyable this one is despite the same director and movie studio being involved. The next two Batman films in this outing had different directors and actors playing Batman and were very much disliked. It would have been interesting to see what had happened had Burton stayed, of course he didn't, but at least we still can enjoy this.More of my reviews at iheartfilms.weebly.com",Batman Returns
249,hoxjennifer,Michelle Pfeiffer steals the show,7,11 October 2015,"I always loved this version of Batman, only because of his counterpart, Catwoman. Michelle Pfeiffer steals the show with her stunning and sexy portrayal of the femme fatale, Catwoman. She is the best thing, after the amazing performance of the creepy and slimy Penguin, about this movie, and I don't think any other Catwoman can do her any justice. I first saw this movie when I was very young - perhaps 4 or 5 years old? I remember at the time all the visuals and special effects looked stunning. Now, granted, this movie is from 1992 so obviously, the visuals of more recent Batman movies shouldn't be compared. However, watching this in 2015, with some hindsight and seeing the Dark Knight trilogy and the more recent angsty/deep portrayals of Batman's character, this movie lost its magic for me. It's beautiful if you look at it in terms of classic Tim Burton, but in terms of an action film, it isn't quite up to par with more recent interpretations. Michael Keaton's Batman simply doesn't cut it anymore.But Penguin and Catwoman hands down are the signature performances of this movie and I challenge Hollywood to one-up either Michelle Pfeiffer or Danny de Vito in their portrayals here.",Batman Returns
250,Derek237,Tim Burton's Yule Tide comic-book hero tragedy,9,8 November 2005,"Batman Returns feels like a Tim Burton film much more than the first Batman did. It is a bit more peculiar, and has a wilder imagination. It also has much more going on than the first, we're introduced to many new characters and quite an amusing plot linking all of them together. This is the first of what will hopefully be many of Burton's films with a Christmas context (if you're a fan of his I obviously don't need to tell you the next one). I really liked that as a setting, it made it stand out much more than any other comic-book film adaptation. It's cold, there's snow, everything should be happy and magical but instead things go bad. I was surprised at just how moving this movie actually was; it really does make you think about the characters, and it is much more operatic and tragic than the first.All the characters were very fascinating, as each of the three main characters (the bat, the cat, and the penguin) came to be under some unfortunate circumstances. They all have the potential to do good (luckily Batman does), and they all seem to be half-creature, half-human, almost struggling with their identities and purposes. The connecting character between these creatures is Max Shreck, played by the always- great Christopher Walken. While he's the only fully human character, he seems to be the most inhuman, he's an evil guy who conflicts with each of them at some point. You probably know the plot or have seen the movie already, so I won't bother explaining the multi-layered plot, but it really came together in a great, unexpected way. The first Batman ended in a way that justice was served, and Batman will continue to be a hero and find a way to cope with his own life, and everything will be okay. This one was such a tragic tale that really portrayed the darker side of being Batman.There were so many things I liked about this movie. The relationship between Selina Kyle/Catwoman and Bruce Wayne/Batman was especially interesting. What really made it so sad was that they were so alike but Selina just couldn't pull it together. Two of my favourite parts of the movie occur during the Christmas party scene. First of course, was when Bruce and Selina finally find out each other's identities. That was such an indescribably moving scene that worked so perfectly. The other part was when Bruce confronts Max Shreck. Shreck talks about how he is the real secret power that runs the city, and that ""it doesn't matter who's mayor."" Bruce replies, ""it matters to me."" What should have been this big, powerful speech scene turns out very brief, when Shreck, clearly indifferent to Bruce Wayne, says ""YAWN,"" then walks away. Not only was it amusing but I thought it did make a lot of sense, that's the way that character is.Danny Devito and some extremely talented makeup artists (not to mention the way the filmmakers ingeniously reinvented him) do a great job in bringing the evil penguin character to life. Honestly, I never saw Devito here. I could sort of make him out, but he really just got into the character so deeply that I saw just the character. I was very impressed with him, it's unlike anything he's ever done, and he certainly did not deserve that Razzie nomination! Danny Elfman's score was particularly incredible as well, and it's a sin that he did not get an Oscar nod.Batman Returns is much edgier and darker in mood than its predecessor. I love both movies, but I think I prefer this one. There was just so much more to it. I love the atmosphere they both create, and no other superhero movies have anything like it to offer.My rating: 9/10",Batman Returns
251,ferreiranazli,Meow!,9,4 July 2021,"The best of the movie isn't the villain or the hero: Selina Kyle stoles the screen! To be fair, the Penguin is a villain at the height of Batman.

I especially like the part when Batman drives the Batmobile and takes out the Circus gang. But I also really like the fight scene where Batman fights the Red Triangle Circus on the street. It's almost like Batman: The Animated Series coming to life. The story was great and even darker than the first film. The film alienated the audience when it was released. Although there were mixed reviews about the film and this wasn't Tim Burton's greatest project but I still like it to this day. It's a film that Tim Burton directed with his unique style and dark tone. Batman and Batman Returns are my favorite superhero films. Ever has and ever will be. A thumbs up. 👍,Batman Returns

While not adhering entirely to the moral sensibilities of the Dark Knight which began with 1989's mediocre ""Batman"" It's with some amount of conviction that I truly believe that with his 1992 follow up ""Batman Returns"" Burton was afforded more artistic Carte-Blanche. Both with the narrative and stylistic content of the picture. Already having vindicated his clout as an inventive and visually captivating force to be reckoned in the minds of others after ""Edward Scissorhands"" critical and commercial success. BR for me personally boasted a movie with a more solidly structured screenplay, a more aesthetically appealing Gotham City and decidedly more intriguing interplay between the primary characters. The sequel this times took it's cue from two rather than one antagonist from the comics rogue gallery being the apparent choices. The Penguin (Danny Devito) and Catwoman (Michelle Pfeiffer). 35 years before the main events of the film take place, a millionaire husband whose surname is Cobblepot awaits the birth of his first child. What should be a day of extreme joy for he and his wife turns to disappointed bitterness when instead of a regular, cutesy baby they are presented with what they perceive to be a deformed mutant. Cruelly abandoning their tragic offspring, whose name is Oswald in to a canal. The current takes him to the sewers where he is discovered by Penguins from a nearby Circus. Leap ahead to the present and Gotham City is being terrorised by a gang of grim, colourful crooks calling themselves the Red Triangle Gang. Led by Oswald who has grown in to a twisted, repugnant villain they act upon his orders, the purpose of which is to forward his own mysterious agenda. Meanwhile dowdy secretary Selina Kyle, employed by millionaire industrialist Max Schreck is bullied and put upon by her arrogant, overbearing boss. A man who mocks her in front of not only the Mayor of Gotham but fellow businessmen. Then one fateful night a chance discovery of illegal activities approved by Shreck to drain the city of it's electrical resources via his own power station. Pushed out several storeys up from his office by her murderous employer she is left for dead only to be granted nine lives and resurrected by stray cats who she was kind enough to feed. Filled with rage and a determination to avenge herself upon Shreck she becomes the costumed, vengeful anarchist Catwoman! Only one man stands in the way of each wronged criminals way and that is Gotham City's most dedicated defender, Millionaire Bruce Wayne aka. Batman (Michael Keaton)It would be inaccurate to label ""Batman Returns"" as a simple comic-book, action movie and while it's basic premise sprung forth from the pages of DC Comics it was more a dark, Gothic opera with complex characters where the basic principals of good and evil aren't so black and white! Yes, there are elaborate, fun action sequences but they took a back seat to the more predominantly rich and beguiling personalities on display. Danny Devito is outstanding as the figurative Penguin of the movie. A man not only repellent on the outside but within. A sleazy, corrupt yet pitiful figure who is nicely mirrored by the conniving Max Shrek played here with chilling coolness by Christopher Walken. An actor who has cornered the market in such roles. Also there is a lop-sided comparison of sorts between he and the movies prime protagonist. While Bruce Wayne, Batman's alter-ego has been raised lovingly and given the best upbringing his parents could afford and was a regular, healthy and content child before his progenitors tragic demise. Oswald was cast away by his parents and forced to to grow up as a side-show freak in a circus. But while Bruce has not the comfort of letting rage cloud him fully with his personal moral duty to his parents memory making his Gotham's maverick champion. He is a man cast-away in to practical loneliness with only his loyal butler Alfred to be of any companionship or counsel. But in Selina Kyle/Catwoman he finds hope and a dangerous adversary, a veritable contraction in terms and played with tenacious cunning and seductive ice-coolness by Michelle Pfieffer in one of her most penetrating, flawless performances to date! Rather than a villain she is more a tragic, feminist anti-hero of sorts. Cracking her whip for all those women that have wronged been wronged and with Max Shreck in her sights she strives to strike a blow in not her but also their name.Burton really casts his magic with the method in which he ingeniously interweaves the various strands of the stories together with only Catwoman and The Penguin being on screen fairly fairly briefly together. But this doesn't impact on the movie as a whole although lamentably Michael Keaton as fine as he is, is left to take more a back-seat to his co-stars more ""interesting"" rogues. Although there is a some focus on Wayne and insight to the man and his unconventional lifestyle it plays second fiddle to the ""bad guys"". Elaborate set-pieces which include Batman's first on-screen encounter with the Red Triangle Gang to a tense scene where his Batmobile is fitted with a device that allows the Penguin to take control of it. Sending it careering through the Streets of Gotham City with Batman at the wheel. It ultimately can't rescue it from becoming the villains movie. A solid effort and somewhat removed from the atypical big budget blockbusters, BR was and is in my mind a strong, crowd-pleasing popcorn movie. Although hardly achieving greatness and not a classic by any means it further went to solidify Burtons reputation in Hollywood. You'll either love it or hate it but you can't deny it's visual creativity and sumptuousness!",Batman Returns
255,SimonD1900,Parody?,3,23 February 2020,"If this was titled as a comedy and parody, I would give a much higher score. Beacuse then it would be almost genius. But I think that Burton and all the actors actually were completely serious about this. But I don't know? Anyway, this movie has a lot going on but there is no real plot to follow, it's just stupid nonsense after stupid nonsense, to the point it's almost hilarious. But it's not followable, to easy to drift out of the film and start checking your phone, beacuse nothing makes any sense and just can't be taken serious. I think the problem was that Burton actually didn't want to make it in the first place, he was fine with only doing the first Batman, which is slightly better then this one also. But changed his mind when he was given full control of Returns, and just made his own thing from some wierd dream he had or something. I don't know. It's also weirdly perverted at times, like it's written by a teenager with sexuel frustration. It's one of those movies that probably is really fun to watch if you're really really really high, but I personally don't do that anymore. I will give this movie 3 points, beacuse it does have some nostslgia for me, which was at least giving me something.",Batman Returns

Catwoman is basically a repressed and suppressed suburban housewife/ working-woman. Batman is a lone and slightly sad, but heroic, figure.

The story was an interesting one and Danny Devito, Christopher Walken and Micheal Keaton gave great performances. Plus lets face it, Tim Burton was a genius and did the comic book character more justice than Joel Screwmacher ever did.Plot: Oswald Cobblepot also know as The Penguin(played By Danny Devito) is abandoned by his parents as child for being deformed. He uses this as an excuse to masquerade a sinister plot to abduct the first born children of Gotham with the help of his goons(Red Triangle Gang) and a very shady tycoon Max Shreck(played by Christopher Walken). Max Shreck later makes Penguin the mayor of Gotham. Selina Kyle(Michelle Pfeiffer) is pushed out of a window by Max Shreck and is revived by cats. Later on she develops cat-like qualities and seeks to destroy Max Shreck and Batman. Her reasons for wanting to destroy the dark knight are not explained.Opinion: Batman Returns is a classic. It has a darker feel in terms of atmosphere. Tim Burton always had a knack for making grim backgrounds look appealing. Micheal Keaton is still sharp as Batman. Danny Devito steals the show as Oswald Cobblepot/The Penguin. When you think about it, he would have made a better Violator for the movie Spawn than John Leguizamo. Michelle Pfeiffer gave Catwoman more personality than Halle Berry ever could. Max Shreck is one of Christopher Walken's best roles. The main reason why I like Batman Returns is that its fun. Its not only creative but its also fun. Something a lot of big budget movies these days sorely lack. The Batman series goes to the dogs after Tim Burton decided to do no more. You don't believe me, look at Batman Forever and Batman and Robin. Thank god that Christopher Nolan breathed life back into the series with Batman Begins.",Batman Returns

I didn't like some of the elements in it like how they handled The Penguin's plan, although very good. I also thought that Michelle Pfeiffer was kind of annoying in this. She didn't do a good job as Catwoman. I will say that Michael Keaton was good, as usual. And Tim Burton's directing is pretty good.But in the end, the one thing that falls is the writing. It was very insipid and not well thought out. It pains me to write this because I was expecting a good movie, but I got kind of a mediocre film. Furthermore, I didn't like how they reimagined Gotham City. It was way too Tim Burton, and didn't feel like Batman. I still have respect for you Tim Burton regardless of the film.",Batman Returns
260,andrewmerritt-31652,It could've been worse,5,27 January 2019,"Batman Returns reunites Tim Burton and Michael Keaton with Tim Burton returning directing another Batman movie and Michael Keaton reprising his role as Batman. Also Batman Returns includes Michelle Pfeiffer, Danny DeVito, and Christopher Walken. The main premise of Batman Returns is that a new villain called the Penguin mysteriously shows up in Gotham. He plans to take control of Gotham, but its up to Batman to put a stop to it. Batman Returns has all the right elements. Michael Keaton returns as Batman, Tim Burton is returning to direct another Batman, its set on Christmas, and we have some new faces, but the problem is the script is a mess. The first twenty minutes intrigued me, but after those twenty minutes its like Tim Burton and Michael Keaton had an idea, but the plot got intercepted by Warner Bros, and turned it into something bizarre and grotesque. After those twenty minutes are up the script takes a major detour with ton of plot holes and lots of sexual innuendos. And I was looking forward to seeing how they were going to combine Christmas and Batman in one movie, but even though the setting does take place on Christmas, there's not a lot of holiday cheer. Plus Tim Burton and Michael Keaton did not look interested at all after they discovered what Warner Bros did with their dream script that they gave up and juts directed this to make easy money. I know the Penguin is supposed to be a grotesque creature, but they make him too grotesque that they transform him into a cartoon rather than treating him like a gangster, which he is in the comic books. Also he has this black stuff coming out of his nose and mouth, which makes no sense, but I guess that's what Warner Bros had in mind when they created him. Michelle Pfeiffer was the only thing keeping this movie from going off the tracks as she brings a different Catwoman to the big screen. Even though the movie was a complete mess, Michelle Pfeiffer's Catwoman is the highlight as she was the only one who seemed interested in making Batman Returns. Overall, It's not the worst Batman movie, but its not the best, and I felt this movie could've been better if the script wasn't rushed.",Batman Returns

262,matlefebvre20,"Batman reviews, part II: A fair sequel",7,25 July 2007,"After an excellent first movie, Tim Burton is back for the next revisionist adventures of the Dark Knight. Only, this time, there are two super-villains.Burton keeps it going and presents an even darker and more disturbing vision of Gotham City, forsakes somehow the psychological side of the superhero and focuses more on giving more action, chases and technological gadgets for this first Batman sequel.The movie opens on the apparition of the Penguin, played by Danny DeVito. The Penguin keeps many characteristics coming from the original comics, like his arsenal of umbrellas, his short and chubby stature, his kick for birds (especially penguins) and his top hat. However, many modifications have been made, mainly to remain faithful to the dark and sinister atmosphere which already prevailed in ""Batman"" and which stays in ""Batman Returns"". These changes are mainly mirrored in his appearance, since he's now presented as deformed, with fins instead of hands, a long beak-like nose and his grotesque clothes.The Penguin comes up to the surface after having lived his whole life in Gotham's sewers. He tries to find his parents only to discover that they're both deceased. Machiavellian businessman Max Shreck (Christopher Walken) then suggests the Penguin to present himself in the elections to become the mayor of the city, with less-than-altruistic plans.The other villain who jumps into the game is Catwoman or more commonly, Selina Kyle (Michelle Pfeiffer). Kyle is Shreck's awkward secretary and when she discovers her boss' malevolent plans, he throws her of the window. But mysteriously, after a group of cats gathered around her body, Kyle gets up, goes back home, where she goes completely berserk, and creates her feline alter ego.It's now up to Batman (Michael Keaton) to come to terms with those two new adversaries who each have different plans and objectives.The Penguin is accompanied by henchmen who look like a group of artists having escaped from a freak show or from the carnival from the movie ""Something Wicked This Way Comes"". As for Catwoman, she's a thief and she falls in love with Batman. The situation gets more complicated when the real people, Bruce Wayne and Selina Kyle, begin to feel a particular affection for each other.The Penguin and Catwoman team up to discredit Batman and arrange things so Gotham's citizens would turn up against him, which would make things way easier for the Penguin and his election plans.It must be said that their plans are meticulously prepared and greatly imaginative. Let's say that their actions are more convincing than the Joker's ones in the first movie.But in ""Batman Returns"", the characters are generally more two-dimensional than in the first movie. The psychology of the characters is far less explored and it's the general presentation who wins in that case. Not only do the look and the costumes of the characters are carefully prepared, but the action scenes also are.The Penguin's presentation is fairly good. He's ugly, grotesque and frightening. His den is no less either. The Catwoman costume, made of leather and 'claws' is appropriated for such a dark picture.Many gadgets appear in ""Batman Returns"". Some are original, inventive and useful, while others are frankly ridiculous. I didn't like what looks like some kind of 'batarang' which automatically hits the enemies one by one and the Batmobile which 'auto-mutilates' to escape from the police cars. However, the Batsuit's retractable wings is a brilliant idea.Gotham City still is a Gothic, dark, disturbing and postmodern metropolis. But the atmosphere is different somehow. The action of the film is set during the Christmas period, which is even more bizarre. We could almost assert that it's some kind of test from Burton's part before the director would launch himself into the production of ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"". At one certain moment in the movie, we even see sunlight, which didn't happen at all in the first movie.The dialog is sometimes bizarre, should it be intentional or not. It can lead to lengthy, boring and disconcerting scenes. But there also are grandiose lines, such as the one where the Penguin distorts the most famous line from David Lynch's movie ""Elephant Man"". And we must not forget that scene where Catwoman meows in front of Batman and the Penguin, just before the store behind her blow up.I also loved the scene where Bruce Wayne and Selina Kyle become aware of each other's respective alter ego. There's visibly something that happens in their minds at that precise moment.""Batman Returns"" is far from being perfect, but it's a much acceptable result nevertheless, especially with such expectations from the public's part. You must notice that if there's something difficult in the film industry, it's to make a sequel from an already acclaimed and popular hit picture. But Burton succeeded in his challenge.And when you look at the Batman movies which follow ""Batman Returns"", that is those from Joel Schumacher, the value from ""Returns"" heightens even more. Some people would even say that this movie is a consolation prize. But while this film is not as good as the first one, it must be appreciated. And it's not necessary to force yourself. It comes all by itself...",Batman Returns
263,darkjosh,"Dark, Gritty, Grandiose, and Entertaining",8,30 August 2000,"If Batman was a dark, hellish nightmare, Batman Returns' has been lowered even further into the darkness in Tim Burton's fantastic follow up to his 1989 hit.Micheal Keaton reprises his role as the Caped Crusader, and as was the case in the first film, does a subtle and effective job of portraying Bruce Wayne/Batman.  The real treat, however, is the new villains that he's gained.  The Penguin, amusingly played by DeVito is wickedly fun; Michelle Pfeiffer's Catwoman is a sly, slinky, and intoxicatingly seductive; and Christopher Walken's Max Shreck is a ruthless, tough, and backstabbing businessman.  While Batman is the hero, he is completely overshadowed by the fun menace provided by the three villains.Gotham City is even bleaker than before; with wrought iron fencing, soft snowfall and greys, whites, and blacks permeating the entire film.  The set design is beautifully gothic and depressing.  The look of the film is nightmarish and dull; Tim Burton would not direct anything so absent of color until Sleepy Hollow, 7 years later.  Danny Elfman's music is also effective with its subtle, tinny, and foreboding score.While the story is not as compelling as its prequel's was, Batman certainly offers a fun script and great visuals: the attack during the Christmas parade, faithful penguin servants, a cavalcade of circus thugs, and, again, a dark vision of the fair city of Gotham.

265,eamon-hennedy,A Great Sequel...,8,10 June 2003,"First thing first. Batman Returns is not as good as Batman, but it is still a fantastic film. The film is more in line with Tim Burton's sensibilities as a film director mainly because unlike the first film which had a lot of studio interference, Burton had a free hand here. Whereas the first Batman film had more of a film noir/urban thriller/horror approach, Batman Returns is more like a dark fairy tale, with Bruce Wayne's mansion more of a castle in this film, snow falling on to the streets of Gotham City and a villain who is definitely a monster. Along with way we have a romantic angle that is played in a more quirky manner than usual, with a humour that is more ironic and touching than the dark and black style in the first film.Of all the sequels to the perfect original, Batman Returns is the best as despite the more fairy tale leanings, it is still a stone throw away from the campness of the horrible Joel Schumacher films and unlike the next two movies, this film is perfectly cast. Keaton once again shows why he was perfect as Bruce Wayne, with a little more humour here than what he showed in the first film, with his chemistry with Michelle Pfeiffer perfect with a touch of bitter sweet about it, especially in the final five minutes in their final confrontation and also with Michael Gough, who plays Alfred. The reference to Vicki Vale being let into the bat cave is an especially nice touch. Speaking of Pfeiffer, she is perfect as Catwoman/Selina Kyle, playing the innocent moments at the start brilliantly, but the psychotic urges in the later parts of the film even better while Danny De Vito was simply born to play the Penguin, being sympathetic yet horrible and disgusting too.While the first film is undoubtedly the best, Batman Returns is more of Tim Burton's statement on the Dark Knight and this universe. His trademarks are in place, while the Penguin is portrayed more as a freak outsider of society than just a villain while the quirky nature of the relationship between Bruce and Selina is also played out in a brilliant sense of twisted humour that only Burton can handle. Plus Danny Elfman's music is perfect with quite possibly the best theme tune in movie history playing throughout.The film is a fairy tale, albeit one without an unhappy ending. Penguin dies horribly, his life in tatters, while Bruce is left to go back to his castle alone, and not live happily ever after with the woman he loves, despite the fact that they are equals. It is a wonderful film and is one worthy of repeat viewing.",Batman Returns
266,xavrush89,Best of the series--Way better than the 1989 film.,10,13 March 2004,"Why is it better?  Because it's true to the dark vision of the comic. Because the imagery is inventive and, unlike the first, there are real moments of fear and pathos in this one.  The first one had too much of Jack Nicholson's shtick, too much Prince music, and an awkward ""romance.""  Here, instead of one villain, there are three.  No Robert Wuhl, and the leading lady is more than just a pretty face.  In fact, Pfeiffer is the #1 attraction of this film.  Her transformation is what drives the running theme, teetering on the edge of sanity and insanity, good and evil.  She becomes truly fearsome.  The costumes and makeup are excellent.  Danny DeVito's Penguin is inspired and anguished, not just a nut.  His circus gang posse is the one element of comic relief (besides that giant duck).  Max Shrek is the only character I'd have toned down, Walken is pretty hammy as the ruthless businessman.  Danny Elfman's score is a perfect fit as usual, and the Siouxie and the Banshees song (""Face to Face"") is easily the best of any of the songs from any of the films, a perfect match of musical artist and film soundtrack.  The least campy of the films, it is macabre, doesn't pander, and demands second and third viewings like an amusement park ride. Bravo Tim Burton and cast!",Batman Returns
267,Cephyran,The better of the sequels...,8,19 November 2004,"Batman Returns is a cool movie. It takes the magic from the first one and keeps it rolling. Of course, it can't fully match the effectiveness of the first one in sheer exhilaration, but its does okay. We return to Gotham City where we discover two new foes on Batman's roster - A short rotund villain called the Penguin, with political aspirations, and Catwoman, a lithe, agile woman with her own agenda. This movie succeeds for several reasons. First, it's Tim Burton directing again, and he knew how to make a good Batman movie. Second, Micheal Keaton reprises his role as the billionaire/Dark Knight with the same energy and dedication. Third, Danny DeVito in the role that everyone will remember him for, since he fills those shoes quite perfectly. And fourth, Michelle Pfeiffer in skin-tight black leather. I think we've got the attention of the entire male demographic narrowed down exactly. A new addition to the cast is the indelible Christopher Walken. Here is a man who can take any role and make it his own. He's a remarkable actor, with a hidden charm that you can almost sense even in his villainous roles.Batman Returns is a worthy successor to the first installment, and quite honestly, the best of the sequels, both in spirit and loyalty to the characters.

I can not stand this sequel at all, Batman and Robin was better then this crap! The sequel brings in two tone villains from the cartoon that nobody even liked including The Penguin and Catwoman. Danny Devito was the best choice for the Penguin but I never liked the villain. He just seemed like some old guy in the sewers with a birth defect who likes to play with birds and collect umbrellas. Catwoman was a bad choice for second villain. She made no sense to be here, I hated her character as well. Plus ever sense the Halie Berrie version of Catwoman came out, you can't take Batman Returns Catwoman seriously. Christopher Walken as Max was alright, not a bad guy from the cartoons but he was a good mad up bad guy who ran on his own rules. Keaton returns ounce again as Batman and his performance has dropped low ever sense the first Batman. Sure this film is dark and has an edge but it falls like a rock. Batman and Robin at least was perfect for a six year old to enjoy while this film would make kids run and cry.

269,brent_or,"Stylistically intoxicating, if you can get by the intense darkness.",7,7 July 2012,"Basically, the downside of this film, to me, is how dark and depressing (and at times, disgusting) it is. This is one of those examples where whatever shortcomings the story and/or character development may have, it is nevertheless an addictively compelling work of visual art, and it works on that level alone. The plot is not bad, but it is not really what drives Batman Returns. The cast is very good, I think. Keaton is IMO underrated as Batman, DeVito and Pfieffer convincingly portray twisted criminal insanity, and Walken is crucial in giving the film a greater level of complexity.Again, the visual look is a wonderland of Tim Burton-isms. The icy winter setting, whimsical penguin commandos and circus crime gang, incredibly cool Batmobile and Batmissle vehicle sequences...there are just so many things to capture the imagination.The problem, of course, and it is a significant problem, is how dark this film is. It is scary, violent, sometimes gross, and ultimately depressing. Batman should be dark and thought-provoking, but this one reaches prohibitive degrees of darkness. It is definitely not appropriate for family/children, and arguably may not really have much redeeming value for adults, either.

270,FlorianLaur,Take it with a grain of salt,7,24 December 2020,"Now I don't really like most comic movies and never enjoyed comics like Batman, Superman, etc. Why? Because stories where you know no matter what, the hero will NEVER lose are boring. Sure, that is true for Bond movies and other films too, but since it is already like that, do we need comics to be movies too?Still, I remembered watching this back in the 90s on tv when I was 11 or 12. I hadn't seen the 1989 Batman (I have now) and I must admit, I could enjoy this one. Because it is so good? Not really. A lot of stuff doesn't seem to make much sense (like the ""birth"" of Catwoman), but the movie to me (even more so than the super cheesy first one with an over the top Jack Nicholson) is a canvas of hilarious acting and fantasy.It might have little to do with the original Batman, but that's ok for me. It's fun to see just how much like a comic (in the sense of convenience, lack of threat, etc) this movie feels. Did I already laugh about the Batmobile in part 1, having just the right tools for situations no one could predict (like giant hedge clippers) I can continue in this one (bars to knock over stilts or conveniently knock bad guys off motorcycles). It's like Alfred reads Batman the movie's script and says ""Now for today, Sir, you'll need those tools for those henchmen"".Then there's Christopher Walken and Danny. Both are not the least bit threatening (I think even as a kid, I never felt this movie was 'dark'), but Danny in my opinion does a good job and seems to have fun playing the character the way he does. I was actually cheering for him, simply for all the silly one liners he had or nonchalantly shooting one od his henchman for saying his plan is too evil. I mean, come on, what's not to love about a caricature of a fictional character that rides in a Rubber duck and has a penguin army?This movie is arguably not a movie that tells you much about Batman (just like in part 1, Michael Keaton (who looks like someone put Billy Crystal in a muscle suit) is hardly in the film). Batman is just the sort of glue that connects all the other parts of the movie and the characters to create a sometimes incoherent mess. But come on, if you don't take it so seriously, isn't that something to enjoy on a different level?

272,nmholland,"Too Much Undeserving Hate, It's Not That Bad",8,3 April 2016,"Batman Returns is directed by Tim Burton and stars Michael Keaton as Bruce Wayne, a millionaire living in Gotham City that secretly spends his nights fighting crime as a vigilante called Batman. After the defeat of his greatest villain, the Joker (Jack Nicholson), Batman has done a relatively good job at keeping the streets clean. However, a new villain is on the rise, a deformed man named Oswald Cobblepot (Danny DeVito), that calls himself the Penguin. Batman must find a way to defeat the new evil, all while managing his very complicated relationship with the infamous Catwoman (Michelle Pfeiffer).While a good amount of people dislike this movie, I actually really enjoy it. I think there are many good elements to Returns, and it may even be as good as the original Batman (1989). Although many criticize Tim Burton's takeover of this film, I don't mind it all that much. This film may not be perfect, but it definitely accomplishes at least one thing: it's fun.The best thing about this movie has got to be the acting. Michael Keaton's Batman, although not my favorite, is legendary. Keaton definitely does a great job as both Bruce Wayne and the caped crusader, and started an amazing legacy. Danny DeVito also plays a near perfect Penguin, and captures a great image of how disturbing and grotesque Oswald really is. Michelle Pfeiffer, although not my favorite Catwoman, does a great job as Selina Kyle, especially in the sequence in which she transitions from normal Selina into Catwoman. Another great casting choice that's overlooked a lot is Christopher Walken as Max Shreck. Walken plays this dirty business man amazingly, and really shows how cruel a person can be.The direction in Batman Returns, I feel, is really good as well. Many people say that Tim Burton went too much Tim Burton on this film, and made it less of a Batman movie, and more of a Burton movie, which I subtly agree with. Although I still think it has more of a Batman feel that a Burton feel, I do see where those accusations come in play. Certain factors of Returns overly captures the oddness of Burton, and, while that can be good, it goes a bit overboard.My complaints with this movie really lie with small things, and aren't anything big, for instance the sexual element of the film, mostly revolving around Catwoman. Catwoman is a sexy, sleek character in both the comics and films, and that's a good thing, because it adds to the complications between her and Bruce. However, she's just a complete slut in Batman Returns. Not only does she friggin' lick Keaton's face, she has some very sexual dialogue, specifically in ""the scene"" with the Penguin (you know the one). There are many infamous lines throughout the movie, and about 80% of them come from banter between Selina and Oswald. I'm not going to provide examples, because I don't know who's going to be reading this, but just go under the ""quotes"" section on IMDb: there's some weird lines in this movie.Another small complaint I found in the film is the vividness of Gotham. Although Tim Burton made his two Batman films dark, Gotham itself doesn't seem too depressing. This is mostly thanks the giant bronze statues positioned throughout the city, and the giant lit up Christmas tree. As far as the statues, they stuck around for Joel Schumacher's Batman films, and we all know how those ended up. Burton makes the city dark, yes, but there are certain parts of the film that just take away from the grittiness that the filmmakers tried to inspire.The last point I'll hit is another positive, and that's the costumes and makeup, specifically on Danny DeVito. The disgusting, round body piece that DeVito had to wear (watch the special features), and the amazing prosthetics on his face, mostly the crooked, pointy nose, are fantastic. The extremities that were involved in making the Penguin look just how disturbing he does is unfathomable to think about. Danny DeVito, who spent five hours in makeup each day, really dedicated himself to this role, and earned any money that Batman Returns provided him with.In conclusion, Batman Returns gets a lot of undeserving hate, and really is a good film, both in Batman terms and in just general terms. Anybody should see this movie, especially if you're a fan of either Batman or Tim Burton.",Batman Returns
273,cordaro9418,A very special Christmas episode...,7,11 September 2008,"Batman at X-Mas......OK, I'm interested. Originally to cast Annette Benning, the CatWoman role seemed to be in safe hands with Ms. Michelle. And Danny DeVito being allowed his freedom of range in playing the Penguin was a great touch. Add some Walken, and we have a film.Not as big a blockbuster as the original, it still carried well. Unfolding a bit slowly and seemingly a bit mixed, it didn't quite follow the comic lore, but, neither did any of the other films in the original quadrilogy.Keaton played his role a bit better this time around, but was also given more script and screen in and out of the mask. He also had the advantage of being the original.Plan on the popcorn, but no breaks allowed.",Batman Returns
274,McFrogg,"Batman, unfortunately, Returns.",3,19 April 2017,"It's a bright, sunny day when that terrible trio The Penguin (DeVito), Max Schreck (Walken) and Catwoman (Pfeiffer) show up and threaten the fair citizens of Gotham City. Luckily, the caped crusader (Keaton) appears in the nick of time and saves the day!""You've done it again, Batman!"" Says Gordon, played by Pat Hingle. The two friends shake hands, and Batman jumps into his batmobile and drives away into the sunset.Just kidding, this is the one with the perverted mutant Penguin and zombie Catwoman. Michael Keaton does a good enough job as Batman, Christopher Walken is Christopher Walken, Pfeiffer's Catwoman is painful to watch with her forced sexiness, and the Penguin is a nightmare. Not because of the acting, but the character is unpleasant. I don't know what Tim Burton is trying to say, but it seems to me that he wants us to feel sorry for the Penguin.While everyone should get a second, or third or even fourth chance, it's impossible to find anything good about the Penguin. Sure, I feel bad when his parents throw him off the bridge, but as an adult he's pure evil. People didn't hate him because of his appearance...they gave him a chance from the moment he came out of the sewers. He's not Edward Scissorhands or the Elephant Man. The worst part is his death scene, with the sad music and crying penguins. Save your tears, a mutated, (but prettier) Joseph Stalin is dead, and the world is a safer place.Returns is in many ways a mean-spirited and ugly movie. The part where the Ice Princess is kidnapped and killed is a good example. As a kid, I really hated that scene...Batman just stood there and watched as the damsel in distress fell to her death. Another is when the fat clown is shot because he doesn't want to kill children. Maybe those scenes are supposed to be horrible and tragic? Probably not, it's a Burton movie.But, there are some positive things here as well: wonderful designs, the batsuit looks fantastic, Michael Gough is perfect as Alfred. The best part about the movie is probably the music by Danny Elfman. It's sad that they wasted all that talent on this crap. Tim Burton should have stayed away from the Batman sequel. If he wanted to make a movie inspired by German expressionist films, he could have made something original instead. Maybe a comedy sequel to Nosferatu...Nosfera2: Bite Harder?",Batman Returns
275,~PL~,It was wonderful...,10,23 January 2000,"Batman Returns was very good. The backgrounds made an nice-looking atmosphere going perfectly with the story and the different moments in the film. The story was basicly simple, but became better when Penguin and Catwoman met each other to ally up against Batman. There are things I did'nt understand, like when Celina Kael dies and cats bite her and then she gets back to life and has a weird cat influence. But this phenomenon was there to add some mystery to this dark movie. Batman is again fighting the bad guys, and living as Bruce Wayne, the nice billionaire. But there is one detail that everyone should forget to say the movie was at least a bit intelligent;forget that people don't recognize his voice when he has his Batman costume! But still this film was a lot of fun. This is a superhero movie, like the first Batman (not the other two things they called Batman Forever and Batman and Robin!!!!), these were the best superheroes movies of these years! But when you think about it, Batman is not really a superhero;he's just a man wearing a cape and a mask and who has a car named The Batmobile and a weird gun! BUT STILL THIS FILM, LIKE THE OTHER BATMAN WAS A LOT OF FUN AND HAD A TIM BURTON'S DARK ATMOSPHERE!!!I give it 81%.",Batman Returns
276,tomb_92,"Less realistic than its prequel, but still fun to watch",6,3 September 2009,"A lot less realistic than the 1989 Batman but this still isn't a problem as Burton is unrivalled at creating fantastical worlds that you become absorbed into. The stories of The Penguin and Catwoman for example are less believable than The Joker's but DeVito's performance is almost as good as that of Nicholson's. The Catwoman story though seems a bit unnecessary and almost like it would be better if it were left out and more time were spent on making The Penguin's story more interesting. It gets a bit silly towards the end and you begin to see the start of the fall for the Batman franchise as the films never picked up until Nolan's Batman Begins. Having said that this film is not as bad as Schumacher's Batman Forever and no where near as terrible as the 1999 film Batman and Robin. Worth it just for DeVito and Walken's superb performances as the villains, though Pfeiffer is a bit weird in contrast.",Batman Returns
277,andro-dolic,Batman returned but Burton didn't,6,5 April 2010,Everything was far of the best . I was disappointed with this Burton's movie in Batman franchise . Maybe it is good but Burton was again imaginative but for me in wrong way . It looks that Nicholson kept the first part in very good atmosphere . Now we had Danny DeVito . Michelle Pfeiffer was maybe very confused but she had very good transformation . I didn't like ending because of fighting in canalization when Penguin died on maybe silly way . I didn't like and dose of action because there are some maybe annoying action . Soul of the movie was empty . That was because Burton now made some childish play . He maybe cared too much on costumes and visual performance . I still think that it is annoying in visual part . Keaton as Batman returned because he followed his way of acting from first part . I don't like this movie so much . Burton disappointed me .,Batman Returns

279,adamsmith-51004,Great sequel,8,14 April 2021,"Brilliant film - this is probably one of my favourite adaptations of Batman and one of my favourite Tim Burton movies. Some people complain that it's too dark, but that doesn't bother me at all. Michael Keaton does a perfect job as Bruce Wayne/Batman, and Michelle Pfeiffer is probably one of my favourite versions of Catwoman to date. Danny DeVito is also amazing as Penguin and makes a convincing villain.",Batman Returns
280,voicemaster71,Mediocre Sequel That Got Too Carried Away,4,20 June 2005,"I saw this movie on opening night and would start my junior year in college that fall. I initially loved this movie when it first came out and saw it twice in theaters. However, I don't particularly like it as much as I did when it was released. Why? I'll explain all that shortly. First, here's what I do love and still love about Batman Returns. 1: Michael Keaton reprising his role as Batman/Bruce Wayne. He did an excellent job. 2: Catwoman: Michelle Pheiffer was superb in the role and she not only stole the movie, I felt she was the best thing about Batman Returns altogether. Selina Kyle, the costume, and the attitude and her relationship with Batman both in and out of costume. 3: The Penguin's mutated look and nothing more. Nuff said. 4: Wayne Manor and the Batcave. The only two sets I really liked. 5: Michael Gough as Alfred. 6: As I said before, Batman and Catwoman's relationship as foes and in regular clothes, we see Bruce pursue Selina, unlike the first film where Vicki pursued Bruce. Plus, the reference to Vicki from the last movie gave it a nice touch of continuity.Okay, here's why I don't give Batman returns the high praise given by many. The four Batfilms of the 80's and 90's share a common link when it came to the directors. To me, Tim Burton and Joel Schumacher both did good on their first films, but got too carried away with their own visions in their second go around, only Schumacher was worse about it.But yes. I feel that Tim Burton got too carried away with his vision in Batman Returns.1: Gotham City did NOT look like Gotham City. I absolutely refuse to believe that set for downtown Gotham was actually Gotham Square. The Zoo where the Penguin's hideout looked like something of a hybrid of the Nightmare Before Christmas and Edward Scissorhands. 2: The Penguin. While I like Danny DiVito as an actor and the mutant bird man look, the Penguin's storyline was totally disgusting to me. The Penguin was portrayed as an ugly character who was a product of circumstances he could not control (his deformity at birth) I hated his storyline. After watching the Penguin on Batman: The Animated Series, I kept thinking, gee, why couldn't they have done that in Batman Returns? I liked it better when the Penguin is highly intelligent and considers himself a member of Gotham's elite. 3: The Red Triangle Circus Gang. What a sick filthy joke! I really hate these guys with a fierce bloody passion. They made the Penguin look even worse. I would have preferred real underworld thugs in comparison. Tim Burton got too carried away with this part. 4: Christopher Walken as Max Shreck. I liked the concept of the evil businessman, but Shreck's look just did not fit into the Batman universe for me. I'd have rather seen somebody like Rupert Thorne over Shreck any day. 5: I know that Dark Knight fans prefer Batman Returns over the Schumacher films, but I am one of those fans who like the Dynamic Duo, so I am a Robin fan and the fact that he was excluded from this film is one reason I don't care for it as much, even though he had been given a much better costume in the comics. But then again, there was talk about Robin being a street guy played by Marlon Wayans. So I guess I am grateful that Robin wasn't included just for the sake of not messing up a popular character.Overall, I still enjoy watching Batman Returns and I love Danny Elfman's musical score on the soundtrack, but the film got way too Tim Burton-ish for me. Batman and Catwoman really made this movie, even though Batman is once again upstaged by the villains. But to be honest, I like Batman Forever over this installment. Batman Returns to me, is mediocre at best.",Batman Returns
281,Funky A,As good as the first one... maybe better...I don't know...,10,10 January 2000,"I loved the first Batman movie(in my review of it I said a big 9 out 10... silly am I... IT'S A BIG TEN!). Batman Returns is a visually stunning film. Its features some of the most wonderful settings in movie history, I am not kidding! The penguin's hideout is incredible and Gotham is even more impressive than in the first movie. Christopher Walken is very good in is role. Once again, Tim Burton created a fantastic setting in which a great story can take place.And it does. The story is a typical comic book story that sticks very well to the Batman character. Even tough I didn't like the Penguin-Catwoman as much as the Joker, I don't know which Batman I liked the most. This calls for repeated viewings. A big ten!!!!!",Batman Returns

Was really unexpected with all the violence, but that made the movie really memorable and over the top.",Batman Returns
283,TimBoHannon,"This is Tim Burton, not Batman",3,28 October 2008,"I was in the Emergency Room a few months ago. After all of the good shows were finished, I searched for something to watch and stumbled on ""Batman Returns."" With no guide, I decided to stay there. I noticed that I sort of enjoyed it, but everything seems more entertaining when you are in the Emergency Room and your pain just melted away. I was also numb to the transgressions of the film because, for some reason I will never comprehend, I had watched it more than one time before. Numbness, however, does not equal quality, and it is never there the first viewing. The problems evident in the first film grow as cancer and leave only sadness, hurt and shame.A crime wave increasingly engulfs Gotham City as Christmas approaches. Max Schreck (Christopher Walken) pushes his design for a new power plant in a private meeting with the Mayor (Michael Murphy) and his aides. In reality, his plant is designed to drain power, simulating a power shortage so he can be the city's savior and turn a sick profit. When Selina Kyle (Michelle Pfeiffer), his insecure secretary, discovers this purpose, Schreck shoves her out of a top floor window. Revived by Cats, she returns to her apartment, mentally snaps, and becomes Catwoman.Meanwhile, the Penguin (Danny DeVito) kidnaps Schreck. In his lair near the sewers, he blackmails Schreck into helping him with a heroic introduction to the public. Schreck soon arrives at a scheme to recall the mayor so he can push his plant unopposed. He convinces Penguin to run as the replacement. Even when he bites a man's nose for all to see, the public still adores him. That reaction is simply too big to leap, much like how the Penguin's men find blueprints to the Batmoblie, much less the technical knowledge to rewire it. Catwoman later joins Penguin after Batman interferes with her vendetta against Schreck, but Penguin is preoccupied with bedding her.The plot I have just described is not as clearly stated in the film. The film jerks unevenly from one subplot to another, and eventually the main story becomes blurred under all the shifting sands.Director Tim Burton's portrayal of the Penguin is unforgivable. Instead of a high class criminal who happens to be fat and have a big nose, Penguin is now a hideously deformed midget. When he is only a baby he eats a live cat. His hands look like claws. He spits and drools blue saliva. His underlings dress in circus costumes. At one point he eats a raw fish, and I don't mean sushi. He actually bites the fish and digs in. Scientists should study his immune system. He violates so many laws of biology he may as well be a new species.Rarely has a cinema character been so filled with pain and hatred. His parents dumped him in a sewer stream as an infant. At some point, circus performers take him in and incorporate him into their freak show, later shut down after complaints of missing children. The Penguin has no function in life; he only wants to hurt people. He is a sexual deviant, such as the time he massages a woman's breast while placing a campaign button. His ultimate plan is so depraved the film should be rated R for that alone. When we see it in action, his gang's transportation is so inefficient they can not possibly finish even a fraction of what they are attempting.The whole film is mean-spirited, but never more than during Penguin's demise. He is publicly disgraced and pelted with rotten fruit. Afterward, he wildly screams ""MY NAME IS NOT OSWALD! IT IS PENGUIN! I AM NOT A HUMAN BEING! I AM AN ANIMAL!"" Next, his life's dream fails and then his gang abandons him as Batman closes in for the kill. In the end, he is reduced to screams of misery as he wildly slashes air with his umbrella. As his slow, inhumane demise reaches its conclusion, blue ink pours from his mouth in such great amounts he would be dead in seconds were it blood. I normally enjoy seeing villains suffer, but the Penguin's thirty minute destruction is depressing, not fun. He was never treated as a human from day one; he never had a chance. Yes, he is evil, but the indescribable cruelty he suffers is so great that in the end I pitied him.The film's blunders do not end with Penguin. Bruce Wayne (Michael Keaton) remains quiet and reclusive. ""Why are you now determined to prove that this Penguin is not what he seems? Must you be the only lonely man-beast in town?"" wonders Alfred (Michael Gough). We first see him sitting pensively, gazing at the floor as if an internal battle is happening in the deepest recesses of his mind. Again, the film treats Batman as being a curse. During a key scene between Wayne and Selina, he speaks about he could not reconcile the ""two truths"" of his life. His ""difficulty with duality"" destroyed his previous relationship. He later speaks about being ""split right down the center."" Even the cavernous, dark sets of Wayne Manor suggest a depressing, lonely existence.The whole movie overflows with festering pain and permanent wounds. Instead of delivering a dynamite climax, the film focuses even more on torturing its characters. Schreck and Catwoman eventually turn up, and then it becomes her turn for an emotional beating. It is the only part of the climax that works, and it does because of Walken. Actually, the only dramas that work are those involving Schreck, and Walken deserves exclusive credit.During all of this, Wayne tears off the hood of his Batsuit. Catwoman earlier penetrates it with homemade claws. The inconsistency continues as Wayne conveniently drops for five minutes after being shot. More proof that Burton is willing to bend anything to fit his misplaced exercise in malice and spite.",Batman Returns
284,Tug-3,I ashamedly admit: my favorite movie,10,28 October 1998,"Whenever anyone asks me my favorite movie, I cringe and say ""Actually, it's *Batman Returns*.""  Then I cover my ears when they yell out ""What?  Are you crazy?"" Actually, it's a fair question.  This film is really an acquired taste, and yes, it does have its flaws.  For one thing, of course, it's not at all true to the comic book: Batman kills, Catwoman is not a thief, the Penguin is not an aristocratic mastermind.  For another thing, the acting borders on awful, from Michelle Pfeiffer's irritating ""I'm-so-lonesome"" schtick at the beginning, to Danny DeVito's thoroughly repulsive histrionics. But this film somehow transcends these picayune concerns and becomes a dark, almost poetic masterpiece.  Tim Burton fills the screen with haunting, daring, and nightmarish images, that capture the essence of the Dark Knight, if not the details.  If you're a Tim Burton fan (which I most assuredly am), you should know that this is probably the most Tim Burtonesque film he has yet made.   I dunno...guess I can't really put it into words...I am a longtime Batman fanatic, and for me this movie captures all the darkness, fierceness, and tragedy that surround the legend of the Dark Knight.  It IS worth renting.",Batman Returns
285,BatBanks,Waste of Character and Plot in Batman,6,24 August 2011,"Batman Returns has ridiculous plot and one unnecessary character. The movie could been better, they didn't show Michael Keaton that much and they portrayed the Penguin as a deformed psychopath while in the comic book and series he was just a criminal whose is a gentleman. Michelle Pfeiffer is a pretty actress, but she was miscast as Catwoman. She is portrayed as psychopath woman who runs around blowing up mall and beat people up while in the comic and series she was just a jewel thief. Like Batman ripped off his mask, really stupid and she get worked up with this. She is the unnecessary character that made this film not make any sense and dumb.",Batman Returns
286,ryanskywalker-87402,"""i am the light of this city... and i am its twisted soul""",7,6 March 2017,"The second trip to Burton's Gothic Gotham maintains much of what I loved from the first. Burton's Gotham is again wonderfully realised in all its German Expressionist inspired glory. This time it's dusted in a Dickensian Yuletide snow. This is however a bleak midwinter.While the first Batman was full of comic book revelry; the second deals with far more complex themes, is much darker and feels a whole lot more Burtonesque. Dealing with hefty themes of childhood abandonment, psychological duality, corruption, greed and a whole lot of death.Danny Devito manages not to be irritating as the penguin; grotesquely deformed; abandoned as a baby by his rich parents at a young age. A deliberate mirroring of Keaton's Batman who also lost his parents at a young age. Keaton seems a lot more stoic in the sequel; a more traditional chisel jawed hero. Christopher Walken's Max Shreck (name pinched from German Expressionist classic Nosferatu) is well, Christopher Walken his usual mercurial self. The standout turn is definitely Michelle Pfieffer, nailing both Selina Kyle and Catwoman's dual natures with such a deft turn; elicits the biggest laughs, wrings the most emotion and is sexy as hell.Critically dismissed as far too dour in 1992 I wonder if the critics would have been so harsh if they'd had to sit through Snyder's study in Grey that is BvS first? Personally I think it's almost as good as the first Batman. Very different films, Returns feels far more personal to Burton and a more mature adult work. The first Batman though has Nicholson dancing to the music of Prince blasted from massive boomboxes. No contest really.",Batman Returns
287,Tresix,A little too Dark Knight,8,15 June 1999,"I liked this movie, but I feel that some of it might be a little too dark in tone.  Especially for the young filmgoers that they were trying to target. Keaton does a good enough job as Batman and, this time, he is given adequate time as Bruce Wayne as well.  Danny DeVito made an exceptional Penguin and Michelle Pfeiffer was superslinky as Catwoman.  I felt we could have done without Christopher Walken's Max Schreck.  The character is weak and not given enough motivation for doing the things that he does.  And we're just supposed to accept that the Penguin has the blueprints to the Batmobile in order to sabotage it!  Now THIS needed an explanation.

288,ichabod81,Perfection achieved.,10,9 January 2004,"Batman Returns is a poem of a film. As Kit Ramsey would say: ""It's a film, not a movie!"". Michael Keaton has totally become one with the character of Bruce Wayne and DeVito and Pfeiffer justify their casting the second they appear on the screen. Nothing short of a miracle. And as much as Burton is my favorite director, Danny Elfman is the magician this time around. The score he created for Batman Returns is in my opinion the highlight of his career so far. The music is absolutely beautiful and supports the imagery dead on. I'm very much looking forward to Nolan's fifth Batman film, 'cause Batman Forever (****) was on the limit of being complete failure and the almost legendary Batman and Robin (*) WAS just that. Still, this one deserves a place in my top 10 best films list. A masterpiece.***** / *****",Batman Returns
289,Lost_In_Translation_,"Overstuffed sequel, barely any Batman",5,6 May 2019,"After re-watching the original 1989 Batman I came away lukewarm about it. It's a classic, but not one that has aged well.Watching Returns right after the 1989 movie...I now appreciated the 1989 movie much more as Returns is a tough watch.For a movie called Batman Returns, the titular character is nowhere to be seen for 80% of the movie. The plot focuses way too much on Penguin and Catwoman. Our caped crusader has essentially no focus at all. A majority of his time is the romance with Selina/Catwoman and even those moments aren't building up to any kind of meaningful depth.The visuals are as stellar than ever and the practical effects aren't too shabby. Keaton still has a bit of the neck issues with the suit, but overall the effects are really good.As with the first, the script here is just the main issue here. The rest of the parts of the movie are already great, it's just the script that really puts all of the rest of the production to waste. Though the lack of sets kind of cheapens the feel. It felt like there were only 3 different locations in the whole movie. It makes the scope of the movie seem way too small.There's never really much going on and when there is, it's not very well established or crafted. Scenes just kind of happen without warrant and rarely add anything to the plot.There's also way too many plot holes or too unbelievable moments. I mean how the hell do Penguin's goons get the schematics for the Batmobile? Why are there NO cops anywhere to stop the Penguin's circus train from driving in the night? Why does Batman have his logo all over everything? Just things there and there that just make zero sense thematically.The performances are solid. DeVito is good, but the script makes him a little too horny and creepy. I don't know how they allowed any of the innuendos in it. They were super obvious and not smartly hidden and even as adult they were just gross and creepy. He was already creepy enough on his own without him joking about humping Catwoman.It's just a movie that is all over the place. It's got a poor script and some really questionable moments. It just falls flat overall. It's probably for the best that Burton didn't do anymore, but then again we got the so bad they're funny Schumacher movies.",Batman Returns
290,crazyrabbits,Would you like a rocket-firing penguin for Christmas?,6,10 June 2006,"In my continuing review of the Batman films, I recently saw Batman Returns again. I believe that it is one of the better comic-book films I have seen, but it is really bogged down by some issues that cause the film to drag.Basically, the film is about the emergence of two new villains, The Penguin (played by Danny DeVito), a vengeful sewer dweller who wants to kill the children of Gotham in revenge for what his parents did to him as a child, and Catwoman (played by Michelle Pfeiffer), a former secretary who inexplicably turns to a life of crime when she is thrown out of a window by her boss, Max Shreck (played by Christopher Walken). And Batman? Christ, who cares. He barely has a purpose in the film anyway, other than to stop the two of them and have a date with Selina Kyle.I said it before in my review of the first film, and I'll say it again here. The film focuses more on the villains than the actual title character, and that is not a good thing by any means. If the characters had any sort of interesting back-story, it might be better, but the way these two come to be villains is just ridiculous. Selina Kyle gets pushed out of a window by her boss, falls many stories, then gets ""licked"" back to life by cats (no, I'm not kidding), and THEN she proceeds to tear up her apartment, make a ridiculous-looking suit made up of spare leather, and suddenly she knows how to do back-flips and fighting maneuvers? A little explanation would have been nice.The way the Penguin is characterized in the comic books is interesting, because he is a crime boss, and poses a continuing threat to the safety of Gotham. Here, we find out that he was born a freak, his parents threw him into a sewer, and then he was raised by penguins, who supposedly taught him how to read, write and commit acts of crime? And what was his plan? To become the mayor of Gotham? Did he even have any political skills of any kind? The fact that he has become a literal penguin only serves to provide fodder for bad jokes that appear throughout the film (notably, the incidents with fish being offered to him, so he can make a complete buffoon of himself).It seems that the plans these two villains come up with are incredibly stupid and ill-prepared. First, the penguin attacks a Christmas-tree lighting ceremony, apparently to kidnap Max Shreck, and then use him to help him become the Mayor Of Gotham. In addition, he kidnaps the Ice Princess and has Catwoman hold her for ransom, then he frames Batman for her murder (even though Batman can't even be caught by the cops anyway since he sticks mostly to rooftops). THEN, when his mayoral plan doesn't work out, he gets a guy to kidnap a bunch of kids and ride through town on a slow-moving vehicle, perfect for a counter-attack. Finally, he gets a number of penguins to walk into the middle of Gotham City (which is strangely deserted), and fire off a bunch of rockets, which, in the end, we came to find out don't really do all that much damage anyway. And what did Selina Kyle do? She blows up a department store, stalks Batman around and gets shot numerous times before electrocuting her boss. Really smart planning there.Michael Keaton gives a better performance in this film than the previous one, if only because he has shed the geeky, shy demeanor and become more forceful and assertive in his role as a protector. Likewise, the rest of the cast gives good performances as well.I realize that in a comic book film, events may be exaggerated, but the physics at work in this film are unbelievable. First we are asked to believe that a woman who's been pushed out of a window can survive a thirty-story fall, when a woman pushed in a similar situation gets killed instantly. Then, we are asked to believe that Batman carries magical metal wings that all of a sudden take shape from his cloth cape whenever he desires it. Finally, we are asked to think that a woman who gets shot several times, then gets partially electrocuted, can survive just because she's dressed in a catsuit. It's these sorts of situations that serve to stretch the limits of the film.In addition, the whole film seems to take place withing a time-span of three or four days, which in that time, sees Batman getting discredited by a guy who has just come from nowhere looking like a penguin, a woman making up a catsuit, blowing up a department store and following her crush around, The Penguin running for the mayor position and failing, and having the time to ""take in the sights of Gotham"", plan all his operations and execute them, AND crash a dinner party. Now that's what I call time management!Bottom Line: In the end, though, the movie is enjoyable for what it is, if you overlook the ridiculous villains, threadbare plot and the lack of Batman himself. I give this film a 6 out of 10, and while it is one of the better films, you're probably better off watching the ever more dependable Batman Begins, if you want to see some more credible villains in action.",Batman Returns
291,Nigel St. Buggering,The Dark Knight at his darkest,9,2 November 2003,"In a bare squeaker decision over its predecessor, this one gets my vote as the best of the Batman movies. This is the Batman mythos as it should always be: a dark, twisted world populated by deeply damaged people. Batman has never been a typical superhero, and this is no typical superhero movie.Yes, it has its share of action and mayhem, but the central pillar holding it all up is the interaction of profoundly disturbed people in bizarre outfits, and the question of what really makes Batman any different from the villains he thwarts.The Penguin, a villain I've never really cared for, is given a great new background here; a tragic, twisted, past worthy of the hero himself. DeVito comes off very well in the role I was convinced Burgess Meredith would own forever. The Catwoman has also been rethought with a strangely ambiguous origin and an unexpected feminist theme. I was originally convinced that Pfeiffer was wrong for this part; I should have learned to shut up after the Michael Keaton controversy.Special mention should go to Bo Welch's production design, which bounces back and forth between skewed circus-from-hell to Speer-like Aryan designs with out-of-control proportions. While very different from Anton Furst's designs of the first film, it complements the story perfectly. Another special mention goes to Danny Elfman's score, still one of his operatic and atmospheric best.From its stunning wordless opening sequence to its actionless melancholy ending, this is the thinking person's superhero film.",Batman Returns
292,FilmFreak94,"For What's It's Worth, A Worthy Sequel",8,18 December 2011,"Batman Returns takes place a little while after the events of the first film. Batman and Gordon are working together to keep the streets safe for the holiday season when a new menace arrives in the sewers. A business tycoon, Max Shreck(played by Christopher Walken) is captured and taken in the sewers to meet the mysterious man called The Penguin. Penguin uses Shreck's connections to resurface and establish himself in Gotham City. Shreck soon uses the Penguin's new popularity to his advantage and starts a campaign to elect him as mayor.While this is going on lowly secretary for Shreck, Selina Kyle, finds out more than she was supposed to and is killed by Shreck. At least for a moment. Selina survives the fall and creates Catwoman to extract her revenge. She also starts a relationship with Bruce Wayne while frequently going toe to toe with Batman.Batman has his hands full this time trying to stop Penguin's true scheme and contending with Catwoman.This sequel draws the focus more to the villains. This works well at some points, like the origin of The Penguin and not so much other times, Selina's transformation scene. It's not that the scene is terrible it's just it drags a bit long. Batman is still present of course but his role is somewhat smaller this time around. The action scenes could also be better polished as the choreography of the fighting looks sloppy sometimes.But for all its faults what this movie does pull off it pulls off great. I'm most impressed with Michelle Pfeiffer's performance as Catwoman which manages to seem confident and edgy but also a little insecure at times. And I'm impressed with Danny DeVito's Penguin. His character actually comes off as pretty tragic at certain points but he still manages to provide a threat to Batman. There are times when I think he tried too much to mimic Jack Nicholson's Joker but I manage to overlook those moments. Gotham City is still beautifully designed and the supporting cast gives it their all. Michael Keaton still gives off one of the best Batman in the history of cinema and Danny Elfman's score is fitting to the dark tone of the film.Overall, this sequel isn't going to please everyone who liked the first movie but I still recommend watching it. It's a good movie and a worthy continuation of the Batman Saga.",Batman Returns
293,GluStick,A little boring but not a bad movie.,7,9 October 1999,This is my least favorite Batman movie. It's not that bad though. It's just a little slow and too dark for the kids to enjoy. It has good f/x and great make-up but the plot is a little dumb. The villains are not that great and that's what the Batman movies are about. The plot has Bruce still fighting the scum of Gotham but now he has two baddies to take care of. The  Penguin and Catwoman. Both trying to destroy Bruce and each other. Michelle Pfeiffer did a good job as Catwoman and Danny DeVito was also good but the characters were a little dumb. Like Christopher Walken's character. It's not as good as Batman or Batman Forever but it really beats Batman and Robin. Check it out if you like any of the actors or if you just like Batman. You'll be sure to find something you like about it but it didn't do for me what the first did. Batman Returns: C+,Batman Returns
294,RLTerry1,Still the Sexiest of Batman Films!,7,12 August 2016,"Released in 1992, Tim Burton's Batman Returns boasts a star-studded cast complete with the German expressionistic filmmaking style and Gothic production design often associated with this iconic superhero franchise. The brilliance of Batman Returns can be witnessed in recognizing that Tim Burton provided audiences with an art house film masquerading around as a superhero Hollywood blockbuster. From the architecture to the costumes and cinematography, this Batman movie has more in common with art than a movie. Not that movies lack artistic appeal, quite the contrary–after all cinema is the art of visual storytelling; but there is a certain artistic charm that surrounds Batman Returns uncommon in other superhero movies. In other words, the focus was more on the art of a Batman story than the plot. Many comic book enthusiasts also regard this installment (as well as its predecessor) as very close to the comics in plot and visual design. Furthermore, hands down, the most memorable element of the movie is Michelle Pfeiffer's Catwoman, and with good reason. Incredibly sexy, seductive, slightly psycho, playful, and conniving. Juxtaposed against Danny DeVito's monstrous Penguin, Michael Keaton's timeless Bruce Wayne/Batman, throw in the self-centered and ruthless Christopher Walken's Max Shreck, and you have a brilliant cast bringing to life iconic characters under the direction of a then- visionary director before he became a parody of himself.Even the most dedicated Batman fans will admit that this film certainly has cinematic problems. But why are the flaws in this movie somehow forgiven but the flaws in Batman v Superman or this weekend's Suicide Squad held against them respectively? Rewatching this Batman movie reveals that it is likely held is such high regard by superhero movie buffs and fans of the comics alike due to of the A-list talent and the artistic or stylistic approach to this story. Because the focus of the film is definitely on the art versus the plot, narrative flaws can easily be overlooked as the experience of this film rests upon the feel and look of everything more so than the plot in and of itself. It is rare for a superhero film to also be so incredibly artistic. And that is why this particular Batman movie stands unique amongst all the others that have been produced over the decades. The passion for visual design is seen in every shot, every costume, and in the sexiness of the interpersonal relationships between the characters. Just like with interpretive art, various interpretations of tone, feel, message, and impression can be found throughout Batman Returns. Regarding the tone of the film, it repeatedly switches from a campy melodrama to tragic love story to action/adventure. In many ways, this film is representative or even self-reflexive of cinema from the 1930s to the 1950s. Paralleling the film's repeated switches of tone and pace, the characters also change personalities, demeanors, and motives. Moreover, control over situations constantly changes hands throughout the movie. Whether as the audience or a bystander in the movie, it is difficult, at times, to discern the villain from the hero. The magic of this Batman movie is that it bridges the boundaries of so many different interpretations of the Batman universe over the years into a film that embodies the art of filmmaking.Not a direct follow up to the successful 1989 Batman, this installment is often celebrated as the most Batman of the Batman movies; it's the one that somehow manages to reflect more about the hero and his world than any other on-screen representation he'd enjoyed before or since. It's a celebration of the Dark Knight that succeeds, in large part, by its refusal to go too dark, but remains off-kilter and uncomfortable, just enough, all the way through. Likewise, the villains are psychotic, larger than life, and legendary. From the tragic character of The Penguin thrown into the river in a warped Moses fashion on Christmas to the beaten down mousy secretary turned bondage clad 1990s feminist Catwoman, Batman Returns is a quintessential Tim Burton film before he just went way too bizarre in recent years. Both The Penguin and Catwoman can be seen as two different mirrors for our caped crusader. Penguin represents a child of wealth who was abandoned by his parents (not unlike our Bruce Wayne) and Catwoman represents the sensual side of Batman that we seldom get to see but we know it's there because he is human. The combination of characters, settings, and behaviors makes this film a fun, erotic, and entertaining Batman movie. The stratified emotions, experiences, and interpretations provides audiences with a dynamic story that plays out beautifully on screen. In fact, the film is so entertaining to watch that you will likely forget that the pacing, plot, and structure of the film lacks critical value.",Batman Returns
295,MinorityReporter,A dark and brooding vision!,7,1 September 2007,"We're in the year 1992. Its been 3 years since the release of the critically acclaimed Batman (1989) and the fans are standing in line eagerly awaiting the follow-up. There premiere arrives and the fans are... divided. Batman Returns has a stellar cast who provided excellent performances and the film was even darker than it predecessor and it featured even more action so why was the film not as successful as the original. I am a great fan of Burton and I love his work but I have to blame him for not making as good a film as the first. ""Why?"" You ask. Burton had complete creative control with this one and therefore it is a much more personal film but he did turn Batman into a side-kick in his own movie (he did in the first film as well but in this one we barely get to see him). Without any reins Burton went completely overboard in darkness and brooding. He also turned a sophisticated villain from the comics into a bloody animal. That being said this is far from a bad movie it simply falls into the category; not as good as the original.The performances from the cast are good, no exceptions. Michael Keaton returns with his wonderfully manic interpretation of the character that is Bruce Wayne/Batman and I for one believes that he deserves the cult following he has as the character because he is excellent. Luckily Batman's love interest was replaced with an actress with talent this time around. Michelle Pfeiffer is excellent as Catwoman and arguably gives the best performance in the entire film. Her transition from boring office secretary to irresistible temptress is excellent and more importantly believable. Danny DeVito does a great job in spite of a character that just doesn't cut it. I love DeVito but I just can't take the character seriously and he never becomes a true menace to Batman the way the Joker did. Christopher Walken is great as well. His portrayal of the power-frenzied maniac is pure joy to watch. He is a true scene stealer and a much more credible villain than the Penguin in this movie.The score is pretty flawless but that is what one has come to expect out of Danny Elfman who is one of the most talented composers in the industry. His score elevates every scene, be it a quiet scene in front of a fireplace or a fight scene on a rooftop. In short he is brilliant. Two thumbs way up. In fact the soundtrack is one of the only things that are superior to the original which was marred by Prince's very 80's sound.The film certainly has merits and quite a few but in spite of these merits the film is simply too Burtonesque and too many liberties is taken with the source material and therefore Batman Returns stands as a good albeit flawed addition to the Batman franchise. However, this was the last good Batman film in 13 years. Burton made the Batman franchise only for Joel Schumacher to kill it. In the end though Batman Returns is an entertaining film with a few problems.7/10",Batman Returns
296,k_g_barreto,"A Bat, a Cat and a Penguin walk into a bar.",6,17 December 2019,"Batman Returns, sequel of the '89 Batman film, starring Michael Keaton as Batman for the second, and probably last, time, and with Tim Burton directing as well. It was a watchable movie, although inferior to the original one. Keaton's Batman doesn't convince and he doesn't have the spotlight, Danny DeVito's Penguim and Pfeiffer's Catwoman are the best things here, mostly for the acting, both characters are just too 'stylized', for the lack of a better term, and honestly, silly as well, they both scream 'TIM BURTON!!!!!!' in absolutely everything.The rest of the characters are just too boring. Alfred just appears for 5 minutes, and that's okay for the most part, Shreck is the generic 'capitalist pig', evil industrialist, that love his son. It's basically that, and the Selina Kyle vs Shreck whole thing was meh, and nothing more. There's a few other secondary characters that doesn't add practically nothing for the plot. Both Vicky Vale and Harvey Dent are not in the movie, but as a sequel, they should play a major role here. Vicky Vale romance with Bruce was okay in the last movie, I can't say the same for Selina/Catwoman and Bruce/Batman, it seems so forced, and how everything ends is just so disappoiting. No character development for Bruce AND Batman, he's the protagonist and that's it. But the technical part of the film is still good, keeping track with the last one. Elfman soundtrack, Burton's Gotha, all the costumes and the crazyness, penguins in the sewer, a giant duck, the whole aesthetics, it's a Tim Burton film after all.Batman Returns unfortunely is a flawed sequel, after a really good film that sinceraly didn't needed one, but they made it and could be so much better than it was.",Batman Returns
297,The Spectacular Spider-Man,Awesome comicbook adaption,9,6 August 2000,"Tim Burton's bizarre imagination once again brings the comicbook to life in a way only he could. An army of penguins with rocket launchers, a rooftop clash between Batman and Catwoman and a runaway Batmobile destroying everything in it's path are just some of the spectacular highlights. Unfortunetly, Returns lacks the more realistic, urban enviroment of stuff like the original Batman (1989) and X-Men (2000), taking place in a completely Gothic netherworld that is almost completely detatched from reality.  This is it's only fault, however - Returns is an outrageous superhero adventure, with awesome make-up and costumes,  witty dialogue and stunning sets. Michael Keaton simply IS Batman, and it's a joy to see him take to the crime-infested Gotham streets again and kick ass. Michelle Pfeiffer gives the performance of her life as Catwoman, sexy, deadly and disturbed in equal measure. Danny DeVito is a perfect Penguin, a sewer-dwelling freak with a collection of lethal umbrellas. . Rounding off the cast is Christopher Walken as Max Schreck, not a character from the comics, but ironically the biggest villain of the three.
   With it's moody yet rousing score, intense action scenes and cool vehicles (including the water-based Batskiboat and a giant rubber duck), Batman Returns is a  treat for the eys and ears and even the brain.",Batman Returns

The film deserves a little of praise, I love Danny and it had some nice elements in it but overall it was really messy and had a really dumb plot with very random scenes that didn't fit well at all.

The movie packs with so much fun, and exhilarating entertainment that strives to success. Tim Burton can really direct, and the movie is worth the hype.It's Tim Burton, halloween-typed theme creates the Christmas Gotham City more thrilling and very intriguing. The rise of Catwoman, played by Michelle Pfeiffer delivers the Tim Burton theme in a very emotional driven way, and Danny DeVito drops a huge thunder cloud with his complicated, emotional tone as the ""Mayor."" With his personal family abduction at the beginning of the movie, to the rise of one of Bob Kane's menacing foes to the final, reimagining climax. The movie sets a villain so well that it not only brings the antagonist a huge return to the big screen, but delivers a fantastic new portrayal by the well-deserved Danny DeVito. DeVito is the ""perfect Penguin we deserved."" Michael Keaton and Michelle Pfeiffer's relationship as the Bat and the Cat is truly a masterpiece. The ""complicated"" and ""sickening"" relationship makes Tim Burton deserve the praise from not only this movie, but both the two Dark Knight movies he'll always be remembered doing.I remember watching this for the first time as a child and loving it every second.

300,Zoopansick,Ehhh it was OK,5,16 September 2004,"I find it hilarious that some people call this (and I'm not joking here) ""a 10"" and ""the best movie ever made"". Please. Now while that may not be the majority of people, it still seems pretty silly to me how one could think that. I guess if you really like Tim Burton you might say something like that, but he has made better movies. Anyway I digress.I saw this on TV today for the first time in about 10 years and remembered how disappointed I was when it came out. I'll grant Burton an eye for the visuals, and would agree that his Batman movies have the best looking Gotham City and have the best Batman (Keaton). However, in this second installment things went a downhill for me. First of all Batman himself is given a back seat and instead we are forced to deal with Devito's Penguin. Once again the most gullible citizens ever are lead to believe that this clearly insane or at least odd and disturbing character would make a good mayor, kind of like they were tricked into believe The Joker was an ""okay guy"" in the first one. Also the needlessly dark touchs like the Penguins plan to kill all the first born sons of Gotham don't work for me. Also some of the stuff comes off as just tacky like the little penguins with rockets attached to their backs or the henchmen dressed up as clowns (didn't we already have a clown in the first one?). The ending is pretty anti-climactic as well and overall it isn't all that entertaining. I think that I actually got more enjoyment out of Batman Forever then I did out of this one (though I think this movie is technically better made). In conclusion this movie isn't the worst movie ever, and has some good moments and an excellent visual style that really resonates the world of Batman. However, some stupid plot points and needlessly dark/bizarre elements keep me from really liking it. If you are a fan of Tim Burton's work you will probably find something you like here. Even a Batman fan can find some good stuff as well. But just because there were worse Batman (and comic book movies in general) made after this doesn't necessarily make this a good let alone great movie. If you really like Batman read the comics books.Zoopansick",Batman Returns
301,mrrockey,Uneven Storytelling with Great Visuals and a Strong Cast,6,18 February 2014,"Batman Returns is an interesting one. It was the second film in the Burton/Schumacher franchise that upon release, scared the crap out of the kids in the audience because of its grotesque, violent imagery and made parents feel uncomfortable letting their kids see it because of the overt sexual innuendo between Batman and Catwoman. Fans seem to generally love it, or hate it. But despite the reputation it held, I still loved this movie as a child. Yes, there were moments that just flat out puzzled me but I still enjoyed it none the less. But as I grow up and mature a little, I see more and more of why this film gets such a mixed reception from the fans. It has some great ideas in there but they just don't quite feel complete in their executions. But does Batman Returns still work as a film? Let's find out!The plot starts off with Oswald Cobblepot, the infant son of the wealthy Cobblepot family who's born with strange birth defects that make him seem half-man, half-penguin. After eating their house cat, the Cobblepots throw him down to the sewers where he gets raised by penguins. 33 years later, Cobblepot sends his circus gang to attack a corrupt business man by the name of Max Shreck's Christmas festivity where he ends up capturing Max Shreck and threatens to reveal his past sins if he doesn't try to get him back into society. Meanwhile, a shy, socially awkward secretary by the name of Selina Kyle, stumbles upon Shreck's evil schemes and gets pushed out a window for it. After getting resurrected by cats, she goes through a mental breakdown where she smashes up her apartment and takes on her new identity as Catwoman. At the same time, the Penguin fools everybody into thinking he saved the Mayor's baby and runs an election to become Mayor.Firstly, I'm gonna talk about why do I think so many people love this movie, the style and atmosphere. Like most of Burton's films, this film has this Gothic, moody atmosphere to it that makes it a very fun movie to watch. The production design is stylized and expressionistic, the score is haunting and beautiful, and the sense of humor is macabre and dark. All this makes for a very appealing movie for both the eyes and ears.But while the atmosphere is great, the storyline is somewhat lost and confused. There's a lot of really cool concepts in this film, but they never seem fully realized and the script ends up suffering because of it. For example, there's the concept of Batman, Penguin, and the Catwoman all being the same deep down as they're all outsiders who put on a different facade to unleash their anger on the thing the thing causes them pain(Batman = crime, Catwoman = women being considered second to men, Penguin = discrimination towards him because of his deformity) but this concept is only brought up towards the end and it feels sorta like an afterthought. They also try to make us sympathize for the villains(with the exception of Max Shreck) which I never did because frankly, they don't come across very redeemable. They just came across as violent douchebags the entire time to me, especially the Penguin, who, even when accepted back into society, STILL decides to get revenge on them and never shows any sign of humanity whatsoever.But at the same time, Burton comes up with a lot of really great images with these characters. There's so many images in this movie that could easily pass off as a painting and there's some even some really subtle symbolism I've noticed after re-watching it. All this makes me wonder if this movie would've worked better had it been its own art-house film with no relation to Batman whatsoever. And it probably would, as Burton doesn't show a whole lot of interest in Batman anyways since all of the villains'origins were changed drastically from the comics and Batman himself is largely overshadowed by the villains in this film.Despite those problems, the cast is still great. Tim Burton may not be the world's greatest storyteller, but he's always been able to get good performances out of his actors and this film is no exception. While Michael Keaton doesn't get as much screen time as expected, he still gave a solid performance as both Batman and Bruce Wayne. The casting of Devito is pure genius and I can't imagine anyone else playing the part. And Pfeiffer adds a surprising amount of depth and nuance to her character. But for me, the biggest scene stealer is Christopher Walken as Max Shreck. He's just fascinating to watch as this corrupt, shady businessman who always come across very mysterious and you never know what exactly he's thinking. I want to see more of this guy.I also thought this movie was quite entertaining. The black humor throughout was funny. While it may be too grotesque for a Batman movie, the twisted atmosphere made it all the more interesting to watch as you don't quite know what Burton's gonna throw at you next. The action sequences were okay for the most part, but there were some memorable moments such as when the Penguin hijacks the Batmobile or the final confrontation between him and Batman.Overall, while it's not a storytelling masterpiece, the stylish visuals and the excellent cast still make for a very entertaining film. But if you are a fan of the comics, you should probably avoid this one as it is mostly a Tim Burton movie and not really much of a Batman movie. I'm gonna give it a 6/10.",Batman Returns
302,bhicks56,First rule in Superhero movies: 2nd is Best!!,9,2 December 1999,"While the first one was vague and virtually plotless, this second entry in the Batman franchise is lavish and darkly beautiful, putting more of Tim Burton's imagination into it.This seems like a rule in superhero movies, to make the second one the better (check out SUPERMAN and SUPERMAN II and compare the two).I think all the flaws of the first one is recovered here. We don't have just one, but two intriguing supervillains. Michelle Pfeiffer, seductive and sly, as Catwoman (""hear me roar"") in a slinky, leather catsuit, and Danny DeVito as a short, ugly Penguin. The details into how they become who they are is obviously implausible, but that doesn't matter.Tim Burton has alot to say of his so-called evil and gruesome characters.If you look close enough, you will see that Christopher Walken's Max Shreck is the true villain. While Catwoman and the Penguin are wronged victims out for impossible revenge. Pfieffer and Keaton are steamily sexy together, paired up with both of their alter egos. But nothing beats the kinkiness of Catwoman on top of Batman, her feline kiss, and the conversation between the deadliness of kisses and mistle toes.The adult situations and scariness of this sequel might disturb young children, so it is probably smarter to let them view the immature and pointless violence of THE POWER RANGERS.But for the grown-ups who aren't afraid of admitting the love of absurdity like this, and the sophisticated kids, this is artsy action/adventure with a soul and a brain.",Batman Returns

Tim Burton's Batman Returns is definitely a very good movie, but it fails to stand on its own, expand the Batman mythos, or develop the characters.There's still a lot to like in this movie. The three Batman villains have very magnetic performances: Christopher Walken as Shreck, Danny DeVito as the Penguin, and Michelle Pfeiffer as Catwoman. All of them really steal their scenes. Tim Burton's inspiration in the set and costume design is always superb, and he brings his quirky charm to this dark yet campy Batman universe. It's the right blend of fun and tension.The pacing of the movie is a little off, some dialogue corny, some of the innuendos a little uncomfortable, but this film rises above all that with great performances, great action, a fantastic score, memorable characters, and a great Batman movie.

305,headfulofghosts126,"Excellent Burton movie, poor bat film...",9,28 April 2002,"I'm still genuinely shocked to find people that prefer the next two films in the franchise over this one. While certainly not as appealing as the original, Batman Returns doesn't deserve the stereo-type it's been stuck with. There are two very strong reasons to see this film: the visuals and the music score. Both are gorgeous. Director Tim Burton and composer Danny Elflman are in top form. It's those damn screenwriters who sucked all the potential out of this film. For starters, we've got too many characters competing for precious screen time. Am I the only one that feels a little cheated by the Max Shreck character? Weren't Catwoman and the Penguin supposed to be the villains in this film? Instead, this boring guy steals the 'main villain' credit. There was also a huge backlash over this film being too dark. Let me be the first to support the decision to change the Penguin's origin and demeanor. As Burton himself said, some little guy in a tuxedo just would not have worked. There's also been criticism that as  a bad guy, you just felt sorry for the penguin... you didn't fear him. I found this added a whole other layer to the film. Believe me, it was intentional. Batman and the Penguin were of the same ilk. So-called ""freaks"" from the same background who walked different paths. What made one go one way and the other another? Could it just as easily have been the other way around? Far more interesting than typical maniacal villain b.s. We have Catwoman and Shreck to fit that stereo-type. My biggest complaint about the script is that because of all the new villains, Batman gets even less screen time in this installment than he did in the first film. This is not a Batman film. He is secondary to the bad guys. A trait that has cursed all the bat-films to date. For anyone who's curious, track down the original screenplay Sam Hamm wrote simply titled 'Batman II'. Take a peek at what could have been. Bottom line: the film looks great, it's the story that drags it down.

This film is very controversial for that some feel it's too dark and bizarre but while the film is dark and creepy I think it all makes for a great movie. Some worried that this scared little kids but my feeling is that this movie is rated pg-13 not g so it's not exactly for little kids and I like the fact that Tim was interested in making a serious batman movie not campy or watered down for kids or pandering to marketing. While the first film felt like a Bob Kane batman this one is much more of a Tim Burton-esquire batman. I like the Christmas/winter atmosphere, seeing Gotham covered in snow looks cool. I love Tim's take on the penguin, it's definitely a ""Burton penguin"" nothing like in the comics and even some thought he was too creepy, mean-spirited and freakish but I feel that he's the villain and should be menacing not campy. I like the back-story that he was born to rich parents who tried to drown him as a baby in shame because he was born a freak, thus he was raised in the sewer by penguins. He wants to belong in Gotham but wants revenge on Gotham, he runs for mayor, tries to drown kids and he's a little perverted but Danny Devito was perfectly cast in the role and gave what might be his best big screen performance. Michelle Pfeiffer is simply the best catwoman ever!(Julie Newmar's 2nd) Her catwoman is legendary and for good reason too! Pfeiffer gives a excellent performance as Selina Kyle, she does a great job making the transformation from wimpy secretary to the empowered catwoman. Great origin story for catwoman, Tim & company were great at making catwoman a complex and interesting villain and of course the outfit is great! She looks like a black cat with a S&M undertone. One of my favorite scenes is when we first see catwoman and she stops a man from mugging a woman and then turns against the woman, telling her that she's weak and I love when she says ""I am Catwoman, hear me roar!"" and she then back-flips away! That was awesome! Pfeiffer looks very sexy in a creepy S&M kind of a way. I love the way she uses her bull-whip, you don't want to get near her with that whip. I also love her voice. Pfeiffer's performance, her extremely tight leather outfit, mystery and story is the best part of the movie. Christopher Walken is great in his underrated performance as a 3rd villain, Max Shrek, who's interesting in his own right and fits well into the story. I love when he says ""what did curiosity do to the cat"". Then there's Micheal Keaton returning as Batman, I understand how a lot of people criticized this film & the previous for not showing enough of batman and focusing more on the villains. Batman is definitely low key and we don't find out much about him but it works for Tim. We don't really need to see a lot of batman to understand him, it kinda works for batman to be more in the background then in the forefront. Keaton is still a great batman, he comes off as a real detective, smart. He really captures the brooding quality of batman and batman comes off as a cool superhero in this film. He's not social but he's always there to save the city. I like how Keaton plays Bruce Wayne as a reclusive millionaire loner and I like his relationship with Alfred. There's great action scenes, great music by Elfman and special effects. The film's dark and creepy but it's fun and is a classic batman movie!",Batman Returns
309,Chris-332,A good sequel to a great movie.,10,14 August 1999,"Batman Returns is probably the best sequel to a comic book/action movie. Tim Burton once again captures the audience, now having Batman have to fight off two villains, instead of one. The Penguin is a great villain, and Danny DeVitto really delivers, yet not as much as Jack Nicholson in the original, and Michelle Pfeiffer did a phenomenal performance as Selina Kyle, a secretary who goes crazy and becomes the Catwoman. Burton's vision of Gotham City succeeds once again at making the audience believe it is a quirky, crime infested town. Though some scenes are cheesy, such as the fact that Catwoman instantly learns how to fight better than Batman himself, you still are captured in the feeling that this movie, like the original, is not a movie just to entertain kids with their favorite good guys, like how Joel Shumacher's vision did. The stunts and special effects in this movie are also great, so you do get some visual excitement, too. I also like the fact that Bruce Wayne falls in love with a villain. All in all, this was the last good Batman movie.",Batman Returns
310,Time Tripper,My favorite of the franchise.,7,13 January 2001,"This wasn't a great movie.  In general, Tim Burton's films are style over substance, but man what style!  The good about this movie is the Batman/Catwoman relationship.  It was far more interesting than the romantic dynamic of the previous film, although still not what I'd consider a classic love story.  Christopher Walken is fabulous, as always.  Danny DeVito does a good job playing the character of the Penguin as written, but I did not enjoy this story's version of that character.  The bad about this movie is that it spends more time focusing on the villains than on the title character.  This seems to imply that the producer's of the film don't believe that Batman can carry a movie on his own.  Nonsense!  After all, in my opinion Batman is one of the four greatest comic characters ever created (the others being Superman, Spider-Man, and Wolverine from X-Men).  This movie is also seriously too dark, violent, and sexual for kids.  It was rated ""PG-13"", but I'm sure was really close to an ""R"".",Batman Returns
311,furiousneon,Well done sequel,10,24 March 2003,"The first batman film goes down in history as one of the best comic adaptions of all time. Forget the sketchy strictly for children adaptions of today(Spiderman, X-Men), although Daredevil was very good. Batman Returns was a very dark weird film. Michael Keaton proves again that he is the best man to slap on the mask. This movie was very fresh.  Good acting, good special effects, very fun movie. There were lots of problems with the films violence and dark tone, many people felt that a film which kids love should not involve these subjects. I thought the films tone was perfect, it made Batman look like a true bad ass and made the villians look like villians, not like guys in costumes doing things ""bad"" until they get captured. If you want to see a good Bat-flick check out this or the first, maybe even Batman Forever, but if you want to see an overlong episode of ER with special guests Batman and Robin, check out Batman and Robin, probably the worst movie i have ever seen.",Batman Returns
312,loulou1992,Better then the Nolan ones,10,18 April 2021,I don't see the hate here or understand the low votes... I grew up with this film like most of the world and I believed it was liked. I never understand why it underperformed either at the time of its release. The film hit's all the right tones for a batman film and in my opinion still the 2nd best. Great film.,Batman Returns
313,Deathstryke,Deliciously dark,8,27 August 2007,"This, in my opinion, was the best Batman movie yet made, because it achieved the right balance between realism and insanity. Batman Begins tried to find realistic explanations for the freakishness behind its heroes and villains. The world of a comic book hero should not be deconstructed so. Mystery and fantasy should be encouraged, because it makes things so much less predictable. It also allows the creative art director to go absolutely bonkers!!! The Gotham City that Tim Burton creates, projects the world of the comic book onto the big screen with complete faithfulness. Floating somewhere between 40's Chicago and 90's New York, its mass of high rise structures provide a glittering backdrop to the predominantly night time scenes, in which silence is torn apart by flame juggling clowns and psychedelic carnival freaks, a mad business tycoon who wants to rule the city and a vengeful seductress in skintight black leather. All driven by a stellar cast who clearly love the saga and enjoy every line given to their characters. One thing that can be said about the cast is that the primary focus is completely stolen from Batman by the villains. However, the magic used by De Vito and Pfeifer to portray their characters Penguin and Catwoman is so damn alluring I can't see it as a bad thing.The tone oscillates zestfully between child's play and adult fun; the conventional quips are loaded with slick wit and raunchy innuendo, and hearty laughs are followed by harsh violence. It's a roller-coaster, a guilty pleasure. I might agree that Batman Returns is a little more icing than sponge, but when the icing tastes so good, who cares?",Batman Returns
314,timefreezer7,An artistic masterpiece although misguided (some minor spoilers),8,3 June 2001,"In order to appreciate this film you must see it 2 or 3 times . I am not kiding . The first time it is going to irritate you and you mayregard it as a travesty . It is very dark and annoyingly grotesque from the middle and further . The beginning is excellent . I can 't say much but it starts like a marvellous German fairy tale set in Christmas . The gothism and the expressionism are dominant through the entire film since the main plot is also in Christmas . Of course the atmosphere is dark like hell and kind of reminds the Gremlins . There are many colourful lights in the entire Gotham city which only emphasise on the nightmarish facts which take place , and on the moody/sad feelings of the heroes . The 4 basic actors are simply great and have a terrific chemistry . Michael Keaton as Bruce Wayne/Batman gives the darkest performance of the entire series. He is the definition of loneliness . He is way better from the prequel though where he seemed a bit out of place . Danny De Vito is good as the grotesque Penguin , a twisted mutant with naturalistic insticts . The same go for the feline Catwoman (Michelle Pfeiffer) who is the impersonation of self-destructive sadomazochism . Pfeiffer gives her best performance not necessarily when in the black suit , but in portraying the disturbed secretary Selina Kyle behind her . But the  kudos have to go to Christopher Walken because he plays his role with the most amazing way . An evil tycoon who wants to manipulate Gotham and drain the energy for his plant . The sad part is that Max Shreque is the only of these 3 villains who moves rationally with specific motives and reasons . Penguin and Catwoman act inconsistenly and are preposterous .E.g.why Catwoman wants to kill Batman since in the beginning he was the one who saved her life ? She wanted to prove that women can kick a** just like them ? Or her pride simply could not standbeing rescued so she turned against him ? Unfortunately there are many other plot holes like that which make grand cons The music score by Danny Elfman steals the show giving perfectly all the dramatic tension in the souls of the heroes , the nightmarish gothic feeling and a slight reference of Christmas fairy tale for kids !! The same go for the magnificent sets and costumes . Every shot is unique. It looks like a painting picture , progressed meticulously to the last detail . The surrealistic delusional feeling which give you is splendid. The clowns of the Red Triangle Circus gang are pieces of pure art . As for the Penguin 's lair with the vast scenery , what can I say ? NOONE has manged to top this impressive set ever since . So what went wrong ? The answer is the script . There is sick violence in some points and rediculous childness in others . The writers and Burton seemed a bit disorientated and sometimes we have a pure dark mess . This is obvious in the scene where the 2 villains plot to destroy Batman by ""turning him into what he hates most : namely us"" or the the one -liners during the fights between Batman and Catwoman . These dialogues are so contrived and silly which make the film worst trash from some saturday morning cartoons !! OH MY GOD WHAT WERE THEY THINKING ???? Not to mention some of the choreographied violence in fight scenes which seem to have popped out of Power Rangers !!!! And exactly why did the Penguin want to kill all the first born boys ? Because of the mommy complex ??? These are questions which will go away ONLY if you have watched it more than once . Anyway Batman Returns is Tim Burton 's best directing job to date . It has symbolisms , psychedelic dreamlike imagery and 4 excellently packed up plots corresponding to the 4 stars . You are NEVER bored since each one of them could carry a movie by his/her own . Be prepared though for a little too much dark . In the worst case you can enjoy it as a very bad written cartoon with much irony and black humour. Nevertheless it is an artistic masterpiece with some classic and very powerful scenes like the the transformation of Selina in Catwoman or the intense finale (30 plus minutes long). Not the best inthe series but the the more surrealistic . Just don 't take it too seriously .BATMAN RETURNS            8.5 / 10",Batman Returns
315,Herbest8,The best of all the Batmans,10,16 May 2009,"This sequel proves that Tim Burton was for all intents and purposes THE best choice to ever direct a Batman movie. The story focuses on Baman taking on three enemies: The Penguin (wonderfully played by Danny DeVito) Catwoman (the slinky Michelle Pfeiffer) and Max Shreck (the superb Christopher Walken).Perhaps the best entry in the series, it has it all: complex themes, complex characters and a dark tone that truly stands out. The cast is simply wonderful although the obvious stand-out is DeVito as the multi-layered Penguin. Here is a guy who is evil, pitiable, funny and perhaps most importantly, scary. The infamous scene with Shreck's image consultants still sends shivers up my spine. In other words, the cast is simply a joy to watch and all turn in first rate performances.I do not hesitate to say that ""Batman Returns"" is my favorite of all the Batmans released (sorry, Dark Knight fans). If you want a superhero film that has a little more to offer besides flashy effects and big scale action, then please check out this badly underrated film. If nothing else, it's at least the best film Tim Burton has ever made.",Batman Returns
316,zurnderrick,Burton's Only Sequel,8,23 August 2009,"Though this movie is dark, bloody, and just plan weird at parts, it's still a fun, action packed thrilled ride that can not be missed, if you are a Batman fan.Michael Keaton returns as Batman, and Danny Devito and Michelle Pfeiffer enter the Batman films as the Penguin and Catwoman. The relationship between these characters is odd and whimsical, but they really nailed it with the character development. Would you believe this is a Christmas film, but it was released in mid-July? This film is great, and in some parts, surpasses the first film. It's mush darker and moodier, but still a great action film to watch. I still do not get why they had to cancel the Happy Meal promotion. I would have loved to get some of the toys from this movie. Good day!",Batman Returns
317,DanielRobertRoss,Not as good as you remember...,7,21 February 2016,"Re watching Batman Returns, I realized just how weird this film is and how mixed my feelings are towards it. We all said at the time this was the dark one, the one that made them turn a corner and change things to be more 'kid friendly' in the following films. And we all know how well THAT turned out, don't we? I remember loving it as a kid (Why did my parents allow me to watch this film filled with sexual innuendos and violent death scenes?) But now, well, it's not a bad film, I refuse to dismiss something that so many people put a lot of effort into, and there are things I love about it. I have always said, and I still maintain that Michael Keaton is the best cinematic Bruce Wayne, but it's a shame that he's barely in the film, just like Burton's first Batman film, the villains are given far more screen time. The plan of the villain, sorry, the back-up plan of the villain is ridiculous. Penguins in the sewers? Really? Michelle Pfeiffer is the highlight of the film, without her I wouldn't like anything really. Danny DeVito gives a great performance, but if they were trying to make his character sympathetic, they failed miserably. He just comes across as a grotesque, one-note monster. Still my favorite of Burton's Batman films, but considering how much I don't like the first film, that's not saying much.",Batman Returns
318,Foggy-7,Michael Keaton: Underappreciated,7,24 August 1999,"Easily the best of the Batman series of any era, this film's unusual take on Oswald Cobblepot (The Penguin) and Selina Kyle (Catwoman) and the nature of evil itself presents Tim Burton and Michael Keaton and their best. Of the three modern performers, Adam West, and earlier Batmen, Michael Keaton best portrayed the schizophrenic nature of Bruce Wayne and Batman, and much like the original, offers us a believable duality.",Batman Returns
319,TheFilmConnoisseur,The Dark Knight Strikes Again,10,17 June 2003,"****Excellent***Good**Fair*Poor
Growing up there weren't the kind of films kids have these days. These days kids can enjoy the Marvel films, Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter, and Pixar pictures. When I was an adolescent we just had the Disney movies, Benji, and loads of animal films. So a film like Batman Returns was something special. A film that had imagination and adventure.Batman Returns is not as good as the original and the plot is questionable. However, director Tim Burton manages to bring the Batman mythology back to life. While not always faithful to the comics but always inspired. Here Michael Keaton returns as the Dark Knight, this time facing the grotesque Penguin and his feline accomplice Catwoman. Both roles played wonderfully by Danny DeVito and Michelle Pfeiffer.After Batman getting revenge in the original by murdering the killer of his parents (the Joker) screenwriters Sam Hamm and Daniel Waters further develop the character of Bruce Wayne by making him question his role as Batman. After falling in love with Selina Kyle (Catwoman) Bruce Wayne doesn't know if he wants to continue as Batman or retire and spend the rest of his live with Selina. The screenwriters and Tim Burton use a lot of religious symbolism in this film by comparing Batman to Jesus. Here like in the last temptation of Christ Selina Kyle is a vision of what life could be but what Wayne doesn't know is that to Selina he is also a vision. In addition the whole first-born child thing is a bit Jewish.The great tragedy of Batman Returns is Anton Furst's death. In the original he not only created a great Gotham City but a great world as well. Bo Welch took over in this film and he was a good replacement. The other great tragedy is Michael Keaton not being nominated for an Oscar. I think Keaton is one of the most underrated actors of our generation. His performance in this film was incredible. The prove of that is the scene where he is searching for the corpse of Selina and you see the face of Bruce Wayne searching for hope. Then the Penguin appears from the water and when Keaton turns to face him, although he is not wear his mask we see the face of Batman. RATING: 4 STARS",Batman Returns

321,mad_mandonna,"An extremely ambitious, greatly directed superhero movie",9,10 June 2005,"Tim Burton the man behind the original Batman film and Beetlejuice, brings the world the sequel to Batman, that exceeds the original in more ways than one. Firstly Michelle Pfeiffer and Danny De Vito are a great mix of Batmans enemies. The dark, deadly and sexy Catwoman works well to rattle some heads within the story and penguin works in the same way that the joker worked in the original. The sets are stunning and immaculate. Gotham city has so many dark alleyways that you could never know what's happening at one time or another. The only thing that gives it a bad name is its script, which at times seems to lapse and then not recover for while. Tim Burtons direction bring superhero films into a new realm. Beats all the superman films and the other Batman films by a mile. Though in terms of realisation the new Batman begins has a bite where this one lacks, but Burton is a more original director than Nolan.*First review written by me at 16. Re-written at 21*Tim Burton has an interesting history in film, between the surreal Pee Wee's Big Adventure and mis-interpreted Alice in Wonderland, Tim Burton's career has gone from an artistic darkly comic director, to unimaginative copy-cat of his own work. I still stand by my original review in that this film is very cleverly directed, beautifully shot, with stunning towering set pieces, but a script that goes from cheesy melodrama, to cheap and nasty humour. Though with some terribly written scenes there are some, incredible ones. Mainly those concerning antagonists Catwoman and Penguin. One scene in particular concerning the two concocting a frivolous ploy to destroy batman is one that springs to mind. The acting is first class, Danny DeVito is deliciously theatrical and sinister, Michelle Pfeiffer relentlessly sexy and smooth. Since my original review Dark Knight was released. Unfortunately for Burton I retract my youthful statement of his originality over Nolan. Dark Knight surpasses Batman Returns and almost eclipses its existence, but this instalment still has great merit and will stand out as one of the greatest superhero films, not to mention cementing Batman as the greatest superhero franchise ever.",Batman Returns
322,Adam-the-tall-1,The perfect sequel.,9,17 September 2020,"Michael Keaton was just as great as before, Michelle Pfeiffer was just as iconic as Nicholson, Danny Devito was great casting, Christopher Walken was okay (there are generic rich mobster characters in the comics like Carmine Falcone, Lew Moxon, Salvatore Maroni, etc, but I know that would require Tim Burton to buy and read comics, and that's way above his pay grade). I'm still kind of upset that they didn't get Billy Dee Williams to actually become Two Face, but the movie is still really good. Not very rewatchable, but still really good.",Batman Returns

The movie stays true to dark, gothic theme which is Batman and they do a really good job of patching up Batman's past from the last movie, including why vicky Vale and Bruce never got together. The only thing I think they could have done better is add more justification to the villains and their motives. I mean how does an insane secretary all of a sudden know how to climb buildings, fight kung-fu style and do all those insane acrobatics?. And how is it, that penguin all of a sudden decides he wants to kill children, and join in a crusade to kill Batman just because they had only one brief encounter. Still, despite the flaws it a great movie. It's too bad the movie ended the way it did though, with Batman's love life gone ( once again) and Selina Kyle (Catwoman) down to only one life. I'm wondering why they don't bring her back, cause they should.",Batman Returns
324,brownish33,20 years on and still the better Batman movie,10,29 June 2012,"Yikes, cant believe this film has reached its 20th anniversary! I was only 5 when this hit theaters but I do remember watching this many times on videotape. Anyway, I'm here to give the new revised review of this amazing film. Looking back at the batman movies, this one comes off as rather unique. Its not your atypical comic book movie in that it doesn't just have loads of action with one fight scene after another. not that it doesn't have its fair share of exciting action scenes, but its more about the characters and how they relate to each other, almost like little character studies. there's a reason why the tagline for the movie is ""the bat, the cat, the penguin"". the movie is all about these 3 characters. One thing that strikes me is the emotional level this film achieves. Its quite amazing what Burton did with the characters, particularly the 2 villains. In the comic books, they are very 2-dimensional characters. Catwoman is just a hot chick who likes to steal things, and Penguin is just a little roly poly guy who wears a tux. If there were ever 2 characters that were in dire need of a face lift, its these 2. Tim Burton gives them both a rather incredible amount of depth and pathos. Penguin is a deformed guy who years after being dumped in the sewer, seeks revenge not only against Gotham city, but more specifically, its children. Talk about a disturbed individual. Catwoman on the other hand was a quiet put upon woman treated badly by her employer, who eventually tries to kill her. This makes her go into a fit of rage, a sequence in which Selina totally lets loose in her apartment, which is quite a powerful scene and which also shows why I love Michelle pfeiffer. Very, very talented actress. Its in this moment she becomes cat woman. Sure beats the hell out of the comics version. Then there is Batman, once again dark and brooding Michael Keaton, born to play this part, who has seemingly no life beyond waiting for that big bat in the sky to call him to duty. During the course of the movie, all these characters go in and out of each others lives, betray each other, love each other, fight each other. The 3 leads are superb together, and the casting for this movie is PERFECT. I mean cmon, who else could possibly play the Penguin? Seriously? But besides the action scenes and the amazing visuals that Burton does so well, there is something about this movie, a kind of sad feeling, especially during the climax. These aren't just your typical run of the mill comic book villains and heroes. These are deeply hurt, deeply scarred people who inhabit this dark wonderland of Gotham city. The penguin acts and behaves like your usual crazy super villain, but at the same time you realize, why is he targeting little kids as his aim of his revenge? Because he himself was thrown into the sewer as a small child and now wants to reenact this on the children of Gotham. Hes hurting. Catwoman and Batman are both messed up which makes them perfect for each other, but they can never truly be together because of the very things that draw them together. The ballroom scene between Selina and Bruce is one of the best scenes in the movie. What can I say, Tim Burton is a master of visuals, a true genius of dark filmmaking. Such is his talent of creating an amazing and creepy atmosphere. He is, as far as I'm concerned, the only guy fit to direct a batman movie. He just gets it. The nerds and basment dwellers who judge a movie simply on how accurate it is to the source material are just narrow minded haters, especially since its popular right now to hate on the older films in order to ""prop up"" the newer movies. the comics by the way, are not the Bible. characters and origins are constantly changing and being re-envisioned by different artists writers. one minute penguin is a tux wearing, snooty, intelligent human being, the next hes a monstrous, bulbous, disgusting slob with claws/""flippers"" and long greasy hair. nothing remains the same for too long in the comics, so when it comes to comic books, nothing in set in concrete. its more up to personal taste, and i believe that burton took the source material and simply added to its greatness. he took the characters and made them so much more compelling then they ever were in the comic books. isn't that what the films are supposed to do?Its really quite sad to see people and the weird crazy internet culture having this massive hard-on for Christopher Nolan's boring, bourgeois bland take on the character. heath ledger did not deserve the Oscar, and was the worst version of joker I've ever seen. Out of all 6 batman films made, none of them I believe have the same kind of raw emotion of this particular batman film. I also like the film also because it deals with outcasts, of which I feel very much an outcast in many ways so I can relate to it. Heck even here on IMDb I am an outcast, as I hate movies that most people seem to love and I love movies people seem to hate! I hate the new Batman's. I think they are dull lifeless garbage. Does that make me Mr. popular or what? But I stick to my thoughts and wont bend just to make some stupid shmoe happy. So there's always this tension with people because my tastes are different. Lets face facts here, most modern versions of thing's suck, and that includes the new batmans. the original 3 are the best, simple as that.",Batman Returns
325,colm-hearne365,Tim Burton's Batman Returns,9,9 November 2012,"Most people say Batman Returns is better than the first Batman movie by Tim Burton because it's darker with eerie music, cinematography and set design and more violent with more explosions and action sequences. Now I wouldn't say it's better than the original because the original had Batman's arch-nemesis, the Joker. But Batman Returns is definitely a very good sequel.One of the things I love about this sequel is that it has not just one, but three villains: Catwoman (Michelle Pfeiffer), the Penguin (Danny DeVito) and even a character who wasn't even in the comics, Max Shreck (Christopher Walken). And all three of them do fantastic. And of course, Michael Keaton is amazing as Batman.I think this movie has a better and more mature plot because it has more to do with crime and conspiracy and the characters (particularly the villains) work very well together. Like the Penguin blackmails corrupt, business tycoon Max Shreck into helping him become part of Gotham City. And later the two of them become partners in crime when Penguin goes up for election for mayor of Gotham so Shreck can continue his schemes. Then later Penguin and Catwoman work together to bring down Batman. And Penguin wants to get revenge on his parents for abandoning him as a baby by kidnapping all the first-born sons in Gotham and killing them.Yet Batman manages to foil Max Shreck and Penguin's plans to take over Gotham, or worse, destroy Gotham. While also confronting his emotions for Selina Kyle/Catwoman, which makes this movie more sensitive.If only Warner Bros. hadn't got rid of Tim Burton, we probably wouldn't have the infamous Batman Forever and Batman & Robin by Joel Schumacher. Oh well, at least we still have Christopher Nolan to thank for restoring the franchise.",Batman Returns
326,mhajs,The best Batman.,7,17 June 2005,"*** out of **** By the time I'm writing this review, I haven't seen Batman Begins (2005) yet, but I can tell that this is the best (or least worse) Batman movie so far. When I watched it yesterday, I kinda of thought it was cool, but it is too absurd at times! Sure this is not only a super-hero movie, but it's also a Tim Burton one. And as far as I'm concerned, Burton sometimes likes to be absurd at his movies. But don't get me wrong! I liked this movie! First of all, the best of it is the Gotham City itself. It's dark and sinister and it fits perfectly with Danny Elfman's score. Actually Elfman's score is another great point! I guess that the best part of the score is when Selina is tearing up her apartment and becomes the Catwoman herself. The score for Batman is great also, but it's more like a heroic score, while the Catwoman's score is more dark, which sure was something I loved! For Pinguin and his clowns, the score becomes a little more silly and childish perhaps, but it's still a great score.For this movie, the story focus now on the Pinyin. There are also other characters like Christopher Walken's one and his son. I loved Christopher Walken, he's as sinister as hell in this one. And Michelle Pfeiffer as the Catwoman! She is truly great, deadly and hot! This is the true Catwoman, not this stupid clown that Halle Berry played recently! I hate that woman with all my guts! There is not much to be said about this movie, unless you spoil some plot twists. All I can say is that Danny Elfman's score is great, the performances are great, the Gotham City great also, and Michael Keaton is sure the best Batman that we ever had. The only problem of this movie is that sometimes it becomes a little silly and too absurd. I don't know how the Pinguin got to live in a sewers that is so beautiful (if you know how to decorate itself, of course), but that's OK anyway. I would make that water, my own private pool instead of the one I, myself, have. But since this is a super-hero movie, we may even tolerate some things. But Spider-Man is sure much more realistic! Well, a taste is a taste....The only one thing I didn't really get is why the Catwoman wants to beat Batman. Maybe I'll post this on the IMDb forum.",Batman Returns

329,v_haritha_in,Watch Nolah's Trilogy Instead,5,12 September 2014,"I did not watch Burton's Batman films while growing up and hence, I do not have the nostalgic love for them. I saw them recently, after having watched Nolah's trilogy, and I am not impressed.Max Shreck (Christopher Walken), an evil businessman and a deformed Penguin (Danny DeVito) plot to take over the city through democratic means; the Penguin runs for the Mayor, with Shreck managing his PR. As expected, Batman comes to the rescue.I found Batman (1989) to be mediocre in every department (apart from the the score) but this movie is simply a joke. The Penguin looks nothing like the bird except for the flippers. His henchmen look like they are dressed for a cheap mummers party; they are more ridiculous than scary. They live in the city's sewer full of water with green paint in it, which is supposedly the toxic waste released from Shreck's factories and the cause of Penguin's deformity. For some reason, there are many penguins living in there. If the chemicals caused mutations in a man, why are the birds quite healthy; aren't they more susceptible? Don't the sewers also carry domestic waste and the Penguin lives there? Isn't the sewer ever inspected? It is movie license I suppose.Remember all the fuss about winning Vicky Vale's heart in the first movie? Well she is just shoved into a couple of passing references in this movie. But who is complaining; Michelle Pfieffer's Selena Kyle/Catwoman looks far more desirable. Her character is annoying as Kyle and her motivations as Catwoman are unclear. But as I said before, she is so luscious, who cares about her motivations as long as she is on screen.Both Penguin and Shreck have evil written all over their faces, it is hard to see the people of Gotham trusting them, especially since they have seen many a super-villain. You would think they would wise up a bit. Whatever.A totally predictable and forgettable film.",Batman Returns
330,zwjonas,Not all bad but mostly,5,8 September 2021,"This is a bad movie. Michelle Pfiefer has the catwoman look and combat down. Other that that her dialogue, her acting, and her as Selina Kyle is absolutely awful. The cats and pegiun scenes are so horrible. The film practically starts over and forgets its first installment other than one brief convo mid film. Using clowns as penguins' henchmen was so off cue after Joker was the villian in the last film. Pengiun was kinda bad but not terrible. Max Shreck was unrealistic no emotion too. As in the first installment, Michael Keaton does well and tries his best but he doesnt have the Bruce Wayne look, doesnt retain Batman's character values and acts very choppy as Batman. He even kills people in both films. Tim Burton just didnt understand the Batman Character. He also doesnt understand Catwoman. She literally steals nothing in this film that is her thing to steal things! The Batman car wiring scene is so bad and makes no sense. The film adds a new unnessacary sexual dialogue. So many problems with the film. I did like the cobblepot max shreck villain plan. Good James Gordon and good Alfred renditions.",Batman Returns
331,nutz4n64,A very dark sequel,7,15 January 2000,"I saw this for the first time after seeing Batman Forever.  This one was still great.  The action at the beginning was very cool, and the plot was pretty good.  Michelle Pfeiffer, like all the Batman babes, was also hot. However, this one is a lot darker and more saddening.  Cat woman's insanity really makes me feel sorry for her.  Danny DeVito did good with his character as well.  I still think that the thing they had in common wasn't ""their contempt for Batman,"" as Michelle put it, but that they had a very disturbed psyche.  A good movie, but expect a little sorrowful feel.",Batman Returns

Michael Keaton is just as good the second time around as Batman/Bruce Wayne(he's later replaced by Val Kilmer and George Clooney) and Danny Devito and Michelle Pfeiffer(in a wickedly sexy role) are perfect as Penguin and Catwoman/Selina Kyle.Michael Keaton returns as Batman/Bruce Wayne who once again can always save the day. Danny Devito is Penguin who was born deformed, dumped into the sewer as a child and raised by penguins. Michelle Pfeiffer is a regular secretary who is murdered by her boss and revived back to life by dozens of ally cats with eight lives remaining. Together they plot to destroy Batman. When they're not trying to do that Penguin wants to become the mayor of Gotham and Catwoman is determined to find out who Batman and eventually falls for Bruce Wayne.

335,Newski_the_Hippie,"Batman, without the love",3,17 October 2005,"I don't mind superhero films moving away from the comics. So don't take my love of Batman Begins and my distaste for this movie as just the typical obnoxious fanboy ranting. The 1989 Batman was a magnificent film. Unfortunately, Tim Burton couldn't make lightning strike twice.I like movies that are Character driven. Unfortunately, this movie is not driven by characters, it is driven by character traits. Catwoman is sexy and Penguin is disgusting. Really nothing more to go on, other then more nifty ways to make toys.Just thinking out loud here, but, are we supposed to like Catwoman? I mean, she's obviously not a total villain, she fights for what she thinks is right. Okay. But she's still not the least bit likable. Hell, the penguin is more likable then her and were not supposed to be able to stand the site of him.A little quirkiness like Catwoman being flown around on a helicopter umbrella is definitely not 1. Funny 2. Suspenseful 3. Enjoyable 4. Quirky... Basically, what were we supposed to be thinking and feeling during this movie? SOme of these scenes only work to try to add a little weirdness to the film, but ultimately fail miserably. Because this movie is not driven by its story, action, or characters.",Batman Returns
336,danielloe,"A great cast, but the direction and story telling leave much to be desired",7,10 July 2015,"*WARNING CONTAINS SPOILERS* Batman Returns, for me, is a movie of sharp contrast. Some aspects of the film I love, while others I think are just plain bad. Before I get into the negatives and positives, let me just say that I still enjoy Batman Returns quite a bit, and I think for the first hour and fifteen minutes, it was a worthy successor to the original Batman movie in 1989. So, the negatives. Tim Burton's directing here is not good. I understand he likes doing weird stuff, and that was prevalent in the original Batman movie more or less. This one... goes a little too crazy. I like the dark and ominous tone this movie sets up, but unfortunately at times it just throws that out the window to have a scene that's just like... what? At one point in the movie Penguin puts a little control device on the Batmobile that allows him to control it, instead of Batman. Penguin controls it by driving a recreation of the bat-mobile, that looks like it's a kid's ride at a carnival. And throughout the scene Penguin has a TV screen that he uses to taunt Batman with, while making some truly horrible jokes. Yeah, it gets that crazy. And another thing, does anyone else notice just how many stretches there are where a central character disappears completely. Batman's in maybe thirty to forty minutes of the movie (okay, maybe that's an exaggeration, but c'mon! It's called Batman Returns, not Batman shows up in a few scenes here and there). Catwoman disappears for a good twenty minutes towards the end of the film, and then just shows up at the end without any explanation. It's just...bizarre. Too many scenes that seem as though they're supposed to be taken seriously just come off as laughable, such as Penguin shooting his rebellious henchman who just stands there stupidly, or the police officers who open fire on the Penguin on sight, y'know, the former mayoral candidate. Then there's the cast, and this is where the movie really shines. Christopher Walken is delightfully over the top as Max Shreck, and is a joy to watch throughout the film, as he tosses lots of great dialogue around. 'Next time I'll push her out a higher window!' he remarks, after discovering Selena Kyle is still alive. Michael Keaton is still a great, if underused Batman, and then there's Michelle Pfeiffer of course, who is just a great Catwoman. Her and Keaton had some great chemistry together in this movie, and the scenes between them were easily the best things in the movie. Michael Gough is great as the dignified Alfred, and he and Keaton share some good scenes. And then... there's Danny Devito as the Penguin, who I just... I don't know why, but I just did not like him. He was kind of funny for a while, and even managed to be fairly sympathetic, but later on he just got too goofy, and he really doesn't do all that much, despite being featured so strongly. He was basically just a figure head for Shreck. Later on he hatches his own schemes, but the fact that he straps rockets to the backs of hundreds of penguins and sends them out controlled by radio waves to destroy Gotham doesn't help his case much. There are some good action scenes though, such as the fights between Batman and Catwoman, not to mention the numerous times the circus gang shows up and Batman has to fight them, such as the acrobats who he gets into some pretty fun martial arts duels with. On a side note, Batman killing people is something that kind of irks me, and I kind of like. Change is good, and I like that there's some difference to this than the Nolan movies in regards to themes, but seeing Batman killing people is just...weird. In the end, I really liked the first chunk of this movie, and absolutely loved Keaton, Pfeiffer, and Walken in their roles, but I really didn't like the end, the directing, or Devito. However, it was still entertaining, so I would recommend watching this movie if you haven't already.",Batman Returns

339,smg242,What a pleasant surprise.,8,19 February 2015,"I didn't really like the 1989 Batman movie much. Sure, Mike Keaton was awesome as Batman, but Jack Nicholson's Joker was way too over the top and silly for me to get any enjoyment out of it. Not to mention the complete disregard of the stellar comic-book character that Commissioner James Gordon is. I didn't like the angle of Joker killing Bruce's parents, and overall the movie was largely ineffective to me. It wasn't nearly as dark as it set out to be.So I obviously go into this expecting mostly more of the same, right? I was half-wrong. Batman Returns is definitely as cheesy and over the top as the first movie, maybe even more. The only difference is, it accepts that and rolls with it. And director Tim Burton greatly succeeded in making this one just as dark and Gothic as its unbelievable madness. It's a balance, one that stays pretty consistent throughout the film.Right off the 'bat', anyone with a brain can surely tell that the acting is greatly improved. Michael Keaton is still the same as Batman, and Michelle Pfeiffer flares it up with a stunning and surprisingly believable performance as Selina Kyle/Catwoman. Christopher Walken is pretty top-notch as his character Max Shreck, but the REAL star of the show here, is, of course, Oswald Cobblepot himself, Danny DeVito.I gotta say, Danny did great with his role. He IS the Penguin, no doubt. This is a really different take on the character of Penguin, probably about as different as Heath Ledger's Joker in The Dark Knight. As different as it is, however, it is that much original, and a really entertaining and satisfying interpretation of the character. In my opinion, it was DeVito's Penguin that was the most interesting, as well as the most well-acted villain of Burton's two Batman movies.However, the movie DOES have its flaws. Most of the action is pretty unbelievable, and overdone (starting to show some camp here, this is thin ice for the Burton/Schumacher difference). James Gordon is still gravely underused, but his persona wouldn't really fit with the tone of this movie I guess. Batman is still a murderous psycho, and isn't bound by any 'no-killing' rule. But given this movie's madness as it is, it didn't bother me as much as it did with the first one (I don't even think he kills in the first one, save for the Joker) There is a lot of sexual humor and I don't really think that sort of thing really fits with Batman, but it IS balanced by the grotesque and sometimes even gruesome imagery and violence. I just think this movie is a pretty hard PG-13. Even more so than The Dark Knight. Also, where did Billy Dee Williams' Harvey Dent run off to?Overall, this movie caught me by surprise, I expected it to be a cheesy Batman movie, and I got exactly that, but a lot more FUN than I thought it would be. Something I really liked in the '89 Batman was the Danny Elfman soundtrack, which eventually even got carried over to the amazing Animated Series. I can truly say even the score was improved with this movie. It's a lot more Gothic and haunting, and I like it more.8/10. Good comic-book movie, one not to be missed, watch it, especially for DeVito's Penguin.",Batman Returns
340,secretagent_007,Return to Batman Returns,7,9 January 2008,"I always disliked this movie when I was younger. After watching it tonight, though, I learned to enjoy it again. I guess I just missed the comic relief of Nicholson's Joker - the obvious gags. So I was surprised to find myself laughing a lot during this sequel. Lots of bat, cat, and bird puns - real groaners, but hey, it's still funny. Another thing that bothered me was how quickly Selina Kyle was able to become Catwoman - a bad ass in skintight pleather who knows enough kung fu to challenge Batman in fisticuffs. Didn't bother me so much this time for some reason. And Batman was just letting her win The thing I realized was that it was written totally as a comic book. The first one, I feel, has its own sort of reality where people can still see their surroundings as ridiculous. It was a city of straight men surrounded by comic book clowns. In Batman Returns, everyone is in on the joke that is Gotham City. It feels less real, but more cohesive.In case you don't remember, this is the movie that made it hip to inject twice as many villains into an action sequel, allegedly to achieve twice the action. Both The Penguin and Catwoman are getting' up in Batman's grill this time around, and everyone's stories intertwine. What I still find unique about this movie is how much it feels like an episode in a series of stories. Basically no re-introduction is given to Batman - everyone watching this movie knows who he is and why, so the only reason we know Bruce Wayne is Batman is from a quick scene of him looking mopey in a dark room, getting interrupted by a giant Bat Signal - so the beginning of the picture is more about the origins of The Penguin and Catwoman. The Penguin is the son of a high society couple (first shot of the movie belongs to Paul Reubens as his dad!) who is born in a sort of egg shape with flippers instead of fingers. So his parents toss him into the frigid waters of an abandoned zoo. And Catwoman starts out as a shy secretary, is nearly killed by her boss (a great Chris Walken), then something snaps in her mind and she becomes the person she always wanted to be. Or maybe she's just a little nuts.Tim Burton directs with his usual (for the time) cartoony zeal, not hesitating to use special effects to paint his picture. Danny DeVito is very good as The Penguin and everyone else manages to not look like a jerk in a goofy costume, which is sometimes the highest possible praise for a movie like this. And Michael Keaton is always a pleasure to behold - one scene in a boardroom with Walken has him casually chuck some documents across the room for Walken's perusal. He does it totally off-the-cuff, proving that Bruce Wayne is not a typical stuck up ""rich guy."" Great moment, fleeting as it is. And in his corner, Walken catches those same documents perfectly, seemingly without blinking, proving he's totally capable of chewing up a guy like Bruce Wayne if he so desires. It's a good little scene. The whole movie was written with enough poppy dialogue and satire to transcend just a simple superhero action movie. There's all kinds of political and social overtones to the characters and situations. Under the huge Art Deco-Atlas-Shrugged-esquire statues throughout Gotham City, the flick plays like a morality tale of the common man vs. their corporate enslavers. Hell of a thing to do with the superhero genre. Good work, gang!",Batman Returns
341,FilmSchoolWriter,"A very nice sequel - sadly, the last really good Batman movie",8,25 August 2005,"Though this movie isn't AS good as the first movie, it's an extremely close second and quite fun. It is the last really good Batman movie (I haven't seen ""Batman Begins"" though). Once again, nicely done, Tim Burton.In his second (and *sniff* final) role as Batman/Bruce Wayne, Michael Keaton does a really good job. Especially when it comes to embodying the role of Batman, something that not many of the other actors who play Batman/Bruce Wayne have been able to do.Danny De Vito does really well as The Penguin. Creepy, possessed, and everything else that comes with the package. The juices are flowing and he fits into the role as if it were a glove.

342,Eightiesjunkie,What Happened?,1,23 March 2014,"That's the question I kept asking myself after I finished watching this film. I know I'll be stepping on many peoples' toes by writing this review. I know a lot of people loved this film when it was released in '92, and I know a lot of people still love the film to this day. However, I'd like to ask all those people to keep an open mind, and to try to see this from my perspective. I never liked this movie! Not even after I first saw it. I wanna put all of you in my shoes: Your eight years old, Batman comes out, you go see it, and afterwords, you're blown away by its sheer greatness. Shortly after, a sequel is announced, and you're ecstatic! You can't wait for it, you expect it to be all that the previous film was and more, then, a few years pass, the film comes out, you see it, and its a complete dud! That's exactly how I felt when I saw Batman Returns. Batman Returns didn't even feel like it was in the same series as Batman! Where as Batman was exciting and fun, Batman Returns was dreary and depressing. None of the villains were charismatic, or fun to watch like Nicholson's Joker, they were all one dimensional and had no motivations! Keaton still plays Batman fairly well, but nothing at all is done with his Bruce Wayne persona. Which in and of itself, presents a huge problem when a semi love interest is interjected into the film. As with Kim Basinger's Vicki Vale, Michelle Pfeiffer does a decent job with what she's given, but that's the problem with her character. You don't know what kind of person Selina Kyle really is, and we have no idea what her agenda is as Catwoman. Why does she want Penguin to frame Batman? We don't know and we never find out. The Biggest problem of the film however, is Danny Devito as The Penguin. Aside from the fact that he rides around in a motorized rubber duck, and that the image of his army of rocket pack penguins is the most unintentionally hilarious thing I've ever seen, The Penguin has to be one of the most poorly done comic book villains ever! The problem is, that The Penguin is done in such an inconsistent way. One minute Tim Burton wants us all to feel sorry for him, and then the next, he wants us all to detest him as the evil villain. As for my experience with the film: It didn't leave me in a good mood or hungry for more, as the first film did. It left me feeling dreary, sick, and empty. For me, going from Batman to Batman Returns felt like chasing Champagne with sewer water. The first drink was great, but the second just left a bad taste in my mouth.",Batman Returns
343,Dorkboss,"Holy Bloody Nose, Batman",7,4 November 2021,"Batman: Returns is a sequel based on the first movie Batman '89 and once again Tim Burton sits in the director's chair. The new villain of the movie is The Penguin (played by Danny DeVito) who's fooling the people to vote for him as Mayor of Gotham, along with Max Shreck (played by Christopher Walken) who's helping him and Selina Kyle (played by Michelle Pfeiffer) who's the Catwoman and her goal is to seek her revenge on the man who did her wrong.While the set design look good, Danny Elfman once again does a great job in composing the songs, and everyone is well-acted. The film still carries its flaws, that of course being the Penguin; watching his character you can clearly tell he's a monster, but the direction wants us to feel some sympathy for him, I'm not judging DeVito about it and he can clearly preform a good job at it, but it's like taking a disgusting villain like Freddy Kruger and we're supposed to feel sympathy like Joaquin Phoenix Jokers. If you ask me I think it would have been better if the film started with him just wanting to belong to society and then the corruption of society doomed him to go bad.Overall: If you can look pass that the film is another blank check that's giving to Tim Burton to do whatever he wants, it still has its joyful moments, if your into seeing a twisted Christmas film weather your a Batman fan or not, then this film is my personal request in seeing.",Batman Returns
344,Fire God,Awful,3,15 February 1999,"One of the most anticipated movies in my life, and by far the biggest disappointment. It is hard to believe that Tim Burton directed both this and the original Batman. I went to see it with my brother on something like the second day it was released. The theater was jam packed, and there was a lot of chatting. When the advertisement stopped, and the movie started many people cheered. When they showed Michael Keaton for the first time, many more people cheered, it was pretty nuts. The excitement from the audience very slowly died down and at the end of the movie no-one clapped, no-one cheered, we just all cleared the full theater, most of us with dull looks on our faces.I think the worst part of the movie was the animal element. There were a bunch of bats, a bunch of cats, and a bunch of penguins. The character to take the animal mania the furthest was Catwoman. She licked herself clean, she purred, she crawled like a cat, and oh yeah, she had nine lives. Did we need any of this? Penguin in the comic books wasn't a penguin, he was a fat guy in a tuxedo. Catwoman wasn't a cat, and Batman wasn't a bat.Why must all good comic book movies have sequels that are so silly? We need more people who understand the comic books, and less people who have no problem with making them look real stupid.

Then, three years later, people flocked into cinemas to see this remake of Tim Burton's masterpiece. I have to say though, there are some good elements to this sequel, but are weighed down by the bad elements. Like the villains. Danny DeVito captures the Penguins personality perfectly, but Michelle Pfeiffer is totally unconvincing as Catwoman. How come she tries to kill Batman, but is romantically attracted to him? Michael Keaton gives another good performance as Batman, but has too few scenes in the film. And don't get me started on Christopher Walken and his bad haircut!

347,vaultoverseer_15,My Favourite Batman Movie,10,13 November 2020,"The majority of people I know tell me ""Dark Knight is hands down the best batman movie, no contest"". I feel like that's a bit unfair - Batman Returns is my favourite because it is for a very different audience. The Dark Knight is for people who like more grounded, serious crime dramas ala Heat. Yet as someone who loves film, I prefer a filmmaker who ushers his own style into a film. Someone who can create a whole, fully realised world. This is why I prefer Burton as a batman director as well. There's multiple reasons as to why this is my favourite batman movie, but also why I think this is just overall a classic in general that can stand the test of time.1. Characters. One thing that's probably most notable about this movie is the abundance of comic villains. Nowadays, it's become more annoying, with comic movies either needlessly adding villains to set up (spiderman:homecoming) or having way too many villains in general (Spiderman 3). Yet This movie does it very well. It's not really a busy movie in fact - there are four characters in this movie, Batman, Max Shreck, Penguin and Catwoman. Yeah sure there are other characters but they barely get any input or reasoning. I think that's why it works here - we have a lot of villains, but we only focus on them. We know the central characters and they are all great. Danny DeVito and Michelle Pfeiffer are especially fantastic here, easily become my favourite villains in any movie. Where people like to criticise the movie is with Max Schrek and Batman's character. Shreck isn't really a colourful, zany, or even particularly evil villain. Yet that's what makes him interesting to me - this totally un-comic book character is the antagonist simply because he wants more power. Plus, Christopher Walken always helps. Michael Keaton's Batman is criticised as kind of bland. I mean in some sense, he doesn't really feel emotional or seem to care about the whole plot other than out of a sense of duty to being batman. But I find his dynamic interesting - he's a superhero, and a really good superhero, who is deeply committed to his concerns. You get this sense of a dark, committed character who's willing to spend his whole life fighting crime. You can tell Keaton understands the role, and why he dropped out of Batman Forever. And as I get to, unlike the first Batman I feel like they give more to his character this time.2. Atmosphere. This is something that's just down to taste I guess. I mean, there are very obvious paintings, a ridiculous amount of smoke and almost no real sense that they ever shot in a real town. I can understand why people might like the Nolan movies going for creating a real serious world, or others liking the Schumacher movies because they make this ridiculous world cartoony. Yet I don't think dark and seriousness are necessarily tied together. For Batman Returns is by far the most dark batman movie ever - maybe even superhero movie. The main villain plans to abduct and murder babies by pouring them into toxic waste. Its ridiculous of course, but it is a dark, gothic world. This is a fantasy world, but it's not a fantasy world we live in. To me, that is what I want. The idea of a millionaire spending his nights fighting crime as a bat is ridiculous - to me you should acknowledge this aspect. To me that is the essence of Batman and his world. We want to see Batman in a dark world facing against crime. And to me that's what you get here in spades. Of course this is due to the amazing cinematography and fantastic score. It really captures the essence of a gothic world - there is beauty but great tragedy and darkness.3. Themes. I feel like a lot of people don't acknowledge this because they don't think the 90s batman movies have no real deeper meanings. Of course none of these movies are truly deep metaphors, but i do believe that they are all peaces of art with things that can be learnt - even if they aren't particularly good. I find this movie to be my favourite in terms of its themes as well. The overall essence of this movie is that morality is not black or white. This is a noir world, after all, and there isn't quite good guys and bad guys. Well Batman is clearly a good guy. Yet he is entering a world of grey. Catwoman is vicious and violent, but she is suffering a breakdown after presumed years of a dissatisfactory life. Max Shreck, despite his evil doings, is just a businessman trying to provide a legacy for him and his son. The Penguin, despite attempting a genocide, is the result of a society pushing him away and showing no love. Batman's whole arc in this movie is to reflect his whole moral compass with this. You'll notice that he starts off watching Penguin on the TV, geuinely concerned about Oswald. When the Penguin dies, it is not a moment of celebration - it is instead a moment of sorrow for this poor man's life. Batman has to come to terms with the fact that nothing is black and white. Bad people come from bad circumstances, and good people can do bad things. This is why I love this movie.",Batman Returns

The problems seem to be with the plot and the handling of the characters. A lot of the action seems arbitrary, with all of the characters lacking believable motivation. It's hard to care about any of them. Danny DeVito as the Penguin makes a better villain than Jack Nicholson's Joker (the previous film had toppled over into ""the Jack Nicholson show"") but the actor and the director fail to make the character even vaguely sympathetic. The Penguin wants to be liked, so what does he do to achieve this? He's a villain so, naturally, he cons everyone. Michael Keaton is competent as Batman but again, it's hard to warm to him. Even having seen the previous film, the viewer doesn't get much sense of what makes him do what he does. Michele Pfeiffer's Catwoman comes off best in this respect, mainly down to a good performance: again, the script doesn't make much sense any of her actions.The director's eccentricities are initially appealing, but the film just isn't enough *fun*. Maybe Tim Burton did treat the material with respect, but the overall effect is too po-faced. The essential ridiculousness of the characters isn't quite acknowledged – we don't laugh at these grotesque and dysfunctional people, but we can't believe in them either. Finally, the film is too long-winded. With tighter editing, ten or fifteen minutes could easily be taken off its running time, giving it a faster pace.I'll be branded as a heretic for saying so, but I think the third of the initial Batman quadrilogy (Batman Forever) is the best of the four films for bringing back the fun, just as Ed Wood is the best of Tim Burton's films by a long way.",Batman Returns

350,trpnallday,"alright as a movie, pathetic as a batman movie",4,9 September 2008,"First of all, Michael Keaton is NOT the person to pick to play Batman. Bruce Wayne is supposed to be the young, slick, playboy millionaire. Keaton is middle aged, ugly, balding, short, stocky and NOT slick or suave. Batman is supposed to be badass and menacing. He is a vigilante not the town mascot! He is disturbed and almost as much a problem for the cops as he is for the robbers. Most of all he is supposed to strike fear into his enemies. Keaton simply does not pull this off. He is short, stocky and looks like a kid trying on his dad's clothes when he puts on the suit. Combine that with his rigid movement and pathetic attempt at fighting and he can only succeed at making the criminals laugh.Add to that the pathetic villains -we have the penguin and catwoman, neither of who seem very menacing at all and really pose little threat to Batman. Also, WTH is with the thousands of little penguins with rocketpacks?? I might like this movie if I was a pothead but otherwise the march of the penguins is just too cute for such a dark movie.Burton's trademark dark visuals are really the only good thing about the movie. I always liked his representation of Gotham but this can't save a movie doomed from the get-go by bad casting/choice of villains.",Batman Returns
351,faolanredwolf,"You know what, I mistook me for somebody else.",10,27 July 2020,"The Organ drones, as we fly through a snowy night, past an enormous iron gate with Cobblepot written above, up towards a large gothic window. Inside we see a large, marble deco gothic room lit, by a massive fire place and a twinkling Christmas lights. In a room, at the far end of a long corridor, we hear a woman screaming, and the screeches of a new born... something. A distressed Doctor, exits the room as the father cries out in horror.Some time later, the new parents stand by the Christmas Tree, cocktails in hand, as they watch a black box by the fire with disgust. Then, a greasy little digit reaches out and pulls their cat, into the dark depths of the box, with only its screams left behind. The couple, down their drinks and watch out at the snow as it silently falls past the enormous window.The snow falls heavily over the Gotham skyline, as the couple hurry through the dark park, towards a small bridge. They quickly lift a wicker cot form the pram and throw it over the side, into the icy waters below. They watch frozen, as the cot disappears into a tunnel and down a waterfall. The babies screams echo into the night.The sewers under Gotham are vast, dark and cavernas. The cot, slowly travels down a large river, as bats fly over head, past grates, tunnels, caverns and lost trash. After, what seems like half an eternity, the cot reaches a man made underground lake, and it's journey finally, comes to an end. The cot, crosses the lake and quietly hits the shore, where a family of abandoned Penguins, begin to surround it. The organ, echoes out and the melancholy journey ends, in a deep crescendo.Tim Burton, was heavily inspired by silent cinema and German expressionism in the making of this movie. It shows. Bo Welchs, gorgeous sets, look like they came right out of a Fritz Lang movie. They are complimented beautifully by the bizarre costumes and awesome miniatures. They all help to give this movie an oddly timeless look. It's as if you're looking at the twisted, nightmare version of a City, rather than any realistic version of Gotham. Even the roof tops, seem to be a labyrinth of insane architectural choices. Wayne Manor, has changed from a new gothic Castle, into a towering mausoleum on a solitary hill. And even the Batmobile, has gone through some slight changes, none more drastic than the Batmissile. But, all of this is simply cosmetic, Gotham is still Gotham and danger still lurks, in the Shadows. The actual differences here, are in tone. Batman (1988) was dark, but it was a comic book movie none the less. This is a Tim Burton movie first and a Batman movie second, therefore its focus is very different. Batman Returns, is all about duality, your inner animal and the struggle between the two yous. Bruce, is having a hard time being Batman, because it leaves him abandoned and alone. But, he knows Gotham would be doomed without him do he has no choice but to be Batman. Max Shreck, is Gothams number one citizen, he is a philanthropist, known for his big heart and giving nature. But, in truth, he is a manipulative, murdering monster, who plays everyone. Selina Kyle, wants to be someone who is loved and respected but she can't even love herself. So she becomes an insane vengeful Catwomen, after falling to her untimely death. Oswald Cobblpot, is the only exception, he wants vengeance for being abandoned as a child, so he wants to kill children. Anything else he does, like running for Mayor, is motivated by achieving that goal and making Gotham suffer. He is truly ugly, on the outside and on the inside and is the only character, who isn't conflicted.I love Batman Returns, it is not only my favourite comic book movie, but one of my all time favourite movies. I love, how it deals with theme's like mental illness, childhood trauma and abuse. This movie, is as dark as they come and it pulls no punches. If, you want to see, a truly twisted winters tale, set in Gotham City, this is the one for you. The cast is extraordinary, the visuals are breathtaking and the score is one of Danny Elfmann's best. I can't recommend this movie enough. If you haven't seen it, or it's been a while, you should give it a look. I promise, you won't regret it.",Batman Returns
352,Lord_Crypto,Impressive Sequel,8,2 July 2007,"Tim Burton has done a wonderful job in bringing another top notch Batman film. The film itself may be equal to the first. With Keaton as Batman returning, we get 2 new big villains, The Penguin and Catwoman! They are utilized brilliantly in this film. Batman Returns is a terrific movie! Michael Keaton does a better job in this film with Batman! I get more of a darker interpretation of him in this film and I like it better than the first. Michelle Pfeiffer plays Catwoman and she does a fantastic job! She creates a sick and fiendish catwoman who is a joy to watch on screen. An excellent portrayal of the character on her part. Christopher Walken plays Max Schreck, a business villain. His character is nothing truly special but Hey, its Christopher Walken. I still feel as if there is a lack of supporting cast outside the big three in this film.Danny DeVito plays the Penguin. Burton and the writers Daniel Waters/Sam Hamm take a different approach to the Penguin in this film. Rather than making him a simple mobster or ganglord like interpreted in the comics, Burton gives him the ""insanity"" characteristic that most Batman villains have. So now the Penguin can be similar to having the mental psyches of other villains like the Joker or Two-face. And best of all, he does it successfully. The character is terrific. The Penguin is portrayed as a troubled, angry, disgusting, and disturbed individual. And some of his characteristics are kept true. He still looks like an absurd villain and seems like a laughable villain. Yet the character gets a very serious approach taken to him and it is done very well. DeVito does a good job of playing that character created for him.The story is very good! I love the opening scene and the opening credits! Although the movie seems really rushed at first in order to get the balls rolling! The action sequences are great in this film. And the special effects are even better. This Gotham City is even darker than the first one and it just expands the viewers imagination even more. The interpretation of this Gotham City is truly Gothic! A nice adjustment is made to Danny Elfman's original theme that gives the music a newer feeling.Batman Returns is a good sequel to the first. Tim Burton did a great job handling these first two Batman movies. It urks me that he was taken away from the series because the industry thought his interpretations were to ""dark"" or ""scary"". That is what Batman is all about and Burton did a good job handling him.",Batman Returns
353,laika-lives,Smitten with a Whip,9,10 September 2006,"So what is 'Batman Returns', anyway?It was marketed as an action film, and many people who've seen it seem to think that they've watched an action film - but really, there isn't that much action, and Tim Burton barely seems interested in it.People often align it with the 'grittier' superhero comics of the late eighties, but honestly, if you've read 'The Dark Knight Returns', that seems just a little absurd; Burton's excessive imaginings have more in common with the day-glo sixties TV series (the Penguin drives around in a giant plastic duck, for goodness' sake).Burton's style is often described as Gothic, and that's a little closer to what we see on screen; the Penguin - deformed, malign, with a tangled history and a subterranean lair - is a Gothic menace dressed up in more respectable Dickensian clothes - Udolfo masquerading as Uriah Heep. But what of Catwoman? She may be raised from the dead, but that PVC catsuit is decidedly Twentieth Century, and her alter ego Selina Kyle's world is all boardrooms and apartments - reminiscent of a 1930s romantic comedy.And then it clicks. The smart but downtrodden secretary romanced by a lonely millionaire? The ensuing complications caused by deception and disguise? 'Batman Returns' is, quite clearly, a romantic comedy in the old Hollywood style, filtered through Burton's S&M dungeon sensibilities. It has more in common with 'The Hudsucker Proxy' (including expressionist sets) than it does with other superhero films. Like many a romantic comedy, it centres around the make-over of the heroine; not from ugly duckling to swan, but from doormat to dominatrix. Michelle Pfeiffer gives one of the performances of her (often remarkable) career; she's iconically sexy as Catwoman (poor Halle Berry never had a prayer), playful and vindictive, memorable because she knows how to act with her whole body. In retrospect, though, it's her scenes as Selina that impress; almost every one of them is a little comic gem, particularly the glimpse we get of her lonely home life. It's a delicately balanced tragicomic performance, and it's in these scenes that the film really sparks to life. Nothing moves me quite like Selina and Bruce Wayne dancing under the mistletoe to Siouxsie and the Banshees, a gun held between them, simultaneously empowered and trapped by their alter egos, doomed to conflict. Forget the easy sentimentality of 'Big Fish' or the gossamer emotions of 'Edward Scissorhands' - this is the most heartfelt scene in all of Burton's films. Love, revenge, fatalism, fetishism, insanity, self-loathing and not a little wit, all in a few short lines and absolutely nailed by the actors - particularly Pfeiffer. Elsewhere, Danny de Vito almost matches her, finding the wounded dignity buried beneath those truly repellent long-johns. The upper-crust villain of the comics is revealed to be nothing more than a sham; Burton's Penguin is a feral creature subjected to his own, Eliza Doolittle-style make-over (almost literally an 'ugly duckling'). It's Burton's most radical - and funniest - reinvention. Christopher Walken's Max Schreck completes a perfect triptych of villains, sliding between casual charm and blank-eyed psychosis with unnerving ease (and is it just me, or does his company's logo bring to mind Mickey Mouse? Perhaps we should ask former Disney animator Burton).Christopher Nolan's 'Batman Begins' - a real action film - has been much praised as the first film to do justice to Batman; I admire Nolan's film, but it would be a pity if it were allowed to overshadow this idiosyncratic gem.",Batman Returns

355,jrm23july@aol.com,"Batman, and Catwoman Are Up To Par, but the Pitiful Penguin Ruins The Sequel",6,22 March 2006,"Batman Returns is the 1992 sequel to the original 1989 Batman movie. Most of the original cast returns, and Batman faces two new- but familiar foes. The Penguin played by Danny DeVito, and the Catwoman played by Michelle Pfeiffer emerge to wreck havoc upon Gotham City and cause Batman even more problems.The movie is not the blockbuster that the first film was, and is too grotesque and gloomy to be appreciated by young children. This is a cold, dark film, filled with pity and shame.The movie opens with the wealthy parents of a deformed baby, putting him into a baby carriage, and dropping him into the Gotham River on a cold winter evening. They don't care if their baby lives or dies or gets devoured by wild animals. The baby floats downstream into the city's sewers, where he is rescued and raised by penguins. Thirty-three years late,r the baby emerges out of the sewers fully grown, with an arched back, a deformed nose, and claws. Going by the name Oswald Cobblepot, the pitiful creature has only one goal in life, to discover who his parents were, and find out why they dumped him like garbage.Cobblepot, later in the movie, becomes vengeful at the citizens of Gotham City for living the fulfilled lives that he had been cheated out of. As Cobblepot emerges from the sewers, newspaper stories circulate about the mysterious penguin-man threatening Gotham City. Oswald is outraged at the fear and scorn he receives, and refuses to allow anyone to call him Penguin. But later, feelings of hate, greed, and vengeance overcome him, and Penguin is the only name he wants to be known by. The Penguin unlike the Joker in the original Batman movie is a pitiful, depressing creature. I felt so sorry for him I was ready to cry. How could his birth parents be so cruel to him? This kind of dark story may have worked for ""The Elephant Man"", or maybe even ""The Sixth Sense"", but not for ""Batman"". ""Batman"" is supposed to be based on a comic book character, played out for action, adventure, and even laughs. This is not supposed to be a serious dramatic tragedy, like Charles Dickens' ""Oliver Twist"", or even ""Great Expectations."" Like in the original ""Batman"" film, Batman is portrayed as a loner, an oddball who happens to be on the right side of the law. Even though he is summoned by Commissioner Gordon (Pat Hingle) via the Batsignal to handle a recent crime wave, he is still feared by many people in Gotham City because of his scientific genius and mystique. Keaton is not as wooden and comical as Adam West (the original Batman) was, but is completely overshadowed by the pitiful Penguin, and the fetishistic Catwoman.Michelle Pfeiffer who plays Max Shreck's (Christopher Walken) secretary curiously stumbles upon her bosses scheme to control Gotham City. She then is thrown to her death by the evil tycoon, so that there won't be any witnesses to his illegal activity. Pfeiffer however, is licked back to life by alley cats, and later becomes Catwoman. Catwoman sews up her own fetish costume and mask, and vows vengeance on Shreck and the rest of Gotham City ESPECIALLY THE MEN.Catwoman being a ""cat"" has nine lives, one of which she loses courtesy of Shreck, one courtesy of Batman, and one courtesy of Penguin after she tells him that he is too ugly to deserve her affections. The Penguin attached her to his flying umbrella, and she flies off to her third death, in a scene of outstanding special effects and creativity by director Tim Burton. Now this is one fantasy sequence that is classic comic book Batman. Later in the movie, in the Penguin's hideout, she loses her fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh lives when Shreck pulls his gun on her and also Batman. Will she also lose her eighth and ninth? I enjoyed Tim Burton's special effects, his dark, brooding Gotham City set and skyline. There were some good acting performances especially by Michelle Pfeiffer, but ""Batman Returns"" spends too much time dwelling on the shame and hurt of Oswald being dumped and abandoned by his birth parents. This type of screenplay is certainly not meant for the young audience that superhero films are supposed to appeal to appeal to. Maybe if ""Batman Returns"" had some comic relief, and comical characters to deliver it, it would have been better. But the character who we empathize with most with is the Penguin who is not sinister or goofy but pitiful. This is not what comic book Batman is supposed to be about.",Batman Returns
356,JimSDCal,A good movie with 2 very good villains,8,20 December 2005,"""Batman Returns"" is the last good movie in the original 4 part series. It is not as good as ""Batman"", because Jack Nicholson's Joker is better than either the Penguin (Danny DeVito) or Catwoman (Michelle Pheiffer). Christopher Walken is very good as Catwoman's abusive boss, who is partially responsible for her transformation from meek office worker to villainess.Another reason ""Batman Returns"" is the last good movie of the original 4 is because Michael Keaton is so good in his role as Bruce Wayne/Batman. He captures the darkness in Batman's personality without being somber. Neither Val Kilmer, or especially George Clooney (I think Joel Schumacher is largely to blame) every really captured the spirit of Batman. Clooney is almost a parody of Batman.I try not to comment much on the plot of movies, because I don't want to ruin the story for anyone, but this movie is well worth watching, and while not a classic, it is a very good super-hero saga.",Batman Returns
357,kingderella,the by far most compelling interpretation of the dark knight,8,27 April 2008,"i was terribly disappointed by Burton's first batman movie. so i was very surprised by ""batman returns"", which just blew me away. what a great interpretation of a great superhero! ""batman returns"" has the atmosphere of a dark, Gothic fairytale, full with Burton's trademark grotesque and whimsy, and a dash of sexual kink. the set pieces, costumes and make up are gorgeous. but the darkness never becomes depressing, the movie is always fun to watch. for adults, anyway; for children, it might be a bit too dark and violent.Batman fights three villains, all of which are compelling characters. Danny DeVito and Christopher Walken give good performances as the psychotic Penguin and the ruthless businessman Max Shrek. but its Michelle Pfeiffer who steals the show with her amazing interpretation of the arguably greatest DC character ever, Catwoman.""batman returns"" has a couple of flaws, most notably Batman himself, played by Michael Keaton. he delivers a solid performance, but he has absolutely zero sex appeal or charisma. it doesn't help that he wears a dorky looking rubber costume that stands out in its ugliness amidst all the beautiful set-pieces and costumes. its a good thing then that the movie seems to focus more on the villains than the hero, since each one of them is far more interesting than the lead.other flaws include the story, which feels more like a series of events rather than a well constructed arc, or the rather mediocre action scenes. but these things barely register, since ""batman returns"" has more than enough momentum and charm to even get away with having a weak lead. this is the by far most compelling interpretation of the dark knight and the twisted world he lives in.",Batman Returns
358,blackcircles,"Just one villain next time, please",6,27 April 2000,"If people are scratching their heads trying to figure out what exactly went wrong with this franchise, the answer is right here. It is a mistake to cram more than one villain into a movie. The Penguin has always been a fine villain for Batman, but in this movie next to the dangerously sexy Catwoman, he comes off as simply boring. Catwoman should have been the only villain in Batman returns, just like the Joker was the only villain in the first movie. It wasn't bad enough that a great villain like Two Face ended up getting the short end of the stick to the Riddler in Batman Forever, but we had to fit in another hero in Robin. By the time we upped the ante to three villains and three heros in idiotically titled Batman and Robin, it had simply gotten ridiculous.So, if anybody out there reading this is even thinking about making a superhero movie, remember this. One hero and one villain. That's all one film can handle, and that's all you need.",Batman Returns
359,wwefreakjon,Batman Series Review,8,20 July 2008,"OK, I finally got my chance to see The Dark Knight and I'm very happy to say that it's the best of the series. But before I do my review of the best I'm going to do my review of the worst, Batman & Robin.No matter how good Uma Thurman looked has Poison Ivy there's no disputing the fact that not only did Joel Shumacher really butcher the directing but Akiva Goldsman made the worst script in his career; a complete 180 from his brilliant ""A Beautiful Mind"". George Cloony was the worst Bruce Wayne (yes he was worse than Adam West) Chris O'Donnell as Robin wasn't much better and Arnold Schwarzenegger became the worst villain of all time as Mr Freeze. I give it a 3/10 for the pure fact that it can be enjoyed if you really have no taste.Next worse is Batman Forever. Even if it had the most Oscar Nods of the series so far Tommy Lee Jones and Chris O'Donnell doomed the movie from get go. Although Val Kilmer wasn't bad as the caped crusader he just didn't fit the role like Michael Keaton did before him. Another problem was that Joel Shumacher replaced Tim Burton which pushed the comic book appeal way over the top. I've got to say that Nicole Kidman was really good in her role and that she did bring the film up a few notches, but the true star of the film was Jim Carrey. He was so funny and yet so insane in his role has Edward Nigma/the Riddler. I give this a 6.5/10 for not being a total flop.Now the series begins to get better with Batman Returns. Although Danny Devito wasn't great as the Penguin, Michelle Pfeiffer brought the real villain to the film. In this instalment Michael Keaton and Tim Burton return to their respective roles has Batman and Director but they definitely lost the magic after they switched the villains. I give this a 7.5/10for not butchering the series.In 3rd Place the original Batman movie which was fantastic. Jack Nicholson was great has the comical Joker and if I were judging this on awesome cartoony flavour than this would be #1 but since I'm not I put it at 3rd. Michael Keaton and Jack Nicholson play off each other so well and there's very little more to it. I give this a 8.5/10 for being the best original and the best Joker until TDK.In 2nd place Batman Begins reboots the series with a fresh new cast. Christian Bale completely renews the character of Bruce Wayne with a new sense of confusion and bringing a real anti-hero play into the role which is a great spin on the character. Michael Caine does a fantastic job as Alfred and completely blows Michael Gough out of the water. Bringing Morgan Freeman into the movie was a great idea all together. Liam Neeson was a refreshing change from the cartoony villains from the earlier movies and has a great heir of arrogance. The only bad part was Katie Holmes playing Rachel Dawes, she was just a bad choice for the part but luckily she was replaced for the latest instalment. I give this a 9/10 for reviving the series.Finally in 1st place is The Dark Knight. The film is not only the greatest Batman/ Superhero film of all time it's also one of the best films of all time. Director Christopher Nolan brought back the realism he used in Batman Begins as well as the actor's. Christian Bale completes his turn to the anti-hero and is so real in the role, but the real star of the movie is the late Heath Ledger. The darkness he brings to the role rivals Hannibal Lecter as a villain. He is so evil and you just can't deny liking him no matter how much you hate him. His plans, or rather lack of plans makes everything very suspenseful. Another star of the film was Aaron Eckhart has Harvey Dent/ Two Face. He brings the knight in shining armour feel to the movie to contrast the anti-hero Batman which is nice until he snaps. I'm not going to give away how or why he snaps but when he does he plays a villain that reminds me Anakin Skywalker in Star Wars 3. He's good but just snaps. Next Maggie Gylenhall plays Rachel Dawes with a much more commanding and sincere character than Katie Holmes did. Gary Oldman is spectacular has Capt. and later Police Commissioner James Gordan. He never loses his trust in our caped crusader even when the world has turned against him. The final stars of the film are the mob boss Maroni who is a new kind of boss instead of the same Old Italian wacko. There is one thing you can't forget which the design for the latest two movies is. To be short and frank are amazing. The Batmobile is so much cooler now than it was and then the Batcycle is even cooler. I give this a 10/10 for bringing the superhero movie into the category of Oscar worthy Drama.To end off I just want to say that I love all the movies (except Batman & Robin) and can say It's one of the greatest series in movie history.",Batman Returns

Michelle Pfeiffer as Selina Kyle was an excellent choice, as was Danny Devito as The Penguin. Tim Burton's dark and twisted cinematic atmosphere is strongly expressed, and Michael Keaton's role as the Dark Knight is even better than the first film. As usual, Tim Burton captivates his audience and causes people to want to enjoy his work repeatedly. I did feel sorry for The Penguin because of what his parents did to him when he was only an infant. It was cruel and inhumane. As for Michelle Pfeiffer's part as Catwoman, you still cheer her on even though she is an opposing force to Batman in the story. Her hidden identity and obvious beauty are both elements that help make that happen. The lack of daylight and Gothic architecture are also factors that help make this movie as good as it is. It helps create a mood and a sense of life for the film. In other words, Burton does it again!I believe that this movie can never be outdone by a future Batman movie, no matter how many times the attempt is made.10/10!",Batman Returns

363,mt7176,"Yes kids, it can be fun to play in the dark!!!",10,26 July 2003,"I loved the summer of 1992 for one reason and that reason was Batman Returns.  Tim Burton had reached the pinnacle of direction and was just a year a way before he would reach it as a producer with Nightmare Before Christmas.  This, more than the original Batman and Edward Scissorhands cemented the director's legacy in Hollywood as the ""Gothic Director of Pop Culture"".  Looking back this is GREAT for lovers of TIM BURTON FILMS but BAD NEWS FOR LOVERS OF THE FIRST TWO BATMANS.  You see with a combine effort many critics, so-called Batman fans who actually had not read a comic book in over 20 years, and neurotic parents joined forces to bury this film.  There were claims of it being too dark, too morbid, and too vulgar.  The last complaint really upset me because the movie's innuendos were no more potent than a 1960's James Bond film. Because of these complaints and the fact that the sequel was not the success that the original Batman had been, even though it still made over 160 million dollars domestically, Warner Brothers decided to go in a lighter direction with the following two sequels.  Everything in this film works.  It plays up on the theme of the original Batman film, that the so called ""normal world"" can be a scary freaky place and that in it your hero is more likely going to be some ordinary guy with problems, trying to save the day for his own personal and some times disturbing reasons.  Nothing against the other super hero movies but that is what made the Batman movies cool and Tim Burton knew it. 
The look of this film is more a Burton and designer Bo Welch creation than a traditional comic book setting but the same can be said about Anton Furst's sets designs in the first Batman.  Once again the film makers took the spirit of the comic book worlds of roof top battles and brought into a film-noir world that worked on the big screen. Now one complaint I can sympathize with NON-BURTON critics is with the Penguin.  It seems that Burton and screenwriter Daniel Waters simply took the character's comic book name and disregarded everything else about him. Instead of the comic book creation, we get a villain that could have come out of any horror flick.  I can understand the aggravation that some true to the bone Batman fans might have felt over the Penguin but it also forces me to ask those fans a question.  How else would you make a villain such as the Penguin, who is fat and short, an entertaining match for Batman?  The way Tim Burton approached the Penguin was the only way it could work outside of turning the villain into a mob boss and the first Batman had pretty much done the whole mob thing. As for Catwoman, if you had a problem with either Tim Burton's spin on the character or Michelle Pfeiffer's performance than you are just not a very good judge of movies.  Catwoman was definitely a strength in Batman Returns. I would have loved if Tim Burton would have gotten to make the Catwoman movie.  It was the director who first brought it up but Warner Brothers dragged their feet and it looks highly doubtful that Burton will be involved or if even the film will ever be made.        I love Batman Returns.  It's a great Tim Burton movie.  Unfortunately it sparked an end to Burton's reign as Hollywood's golden director.  A year later the over-rated Spielberg would recapture the title and Joel Schumacher would be named the director of the third Batman.  The movies were never the same after that.  Still all is not wrong with the world.  The third Batman was decent but the fourth one was horrible, and Tim Burton would go onto make entertaining films such as Sleepy Hollow.  But still I wish movies would get back that quirky, imaginative, and sometimes dark edge that has been largely missing in movies in recent years.",Batman Returns

Michael Keaton returns to the franchise. I definitely think he's the best Batman of all time. George Clooney sucked. And whoever else played him was awful. This was a terrific choice for an actor.All of the special effects can get a little goofy at times. It has some intense scenes though. In my opinion this film is for kids age: 12 and up. So I give this movie a thumbs up. The first film gets two thumbs up. It was amazing. This one wasn't amazing. But it did continue the story in a nice way. The style of the camera shots were good. The close ups were nice. And overall the film did have its moments. So it's not awful. If you're a true Batman fan see it.,Batman Returns
365,dissidenz,good villains,7,14 May 2005,"If De Vito and/or Pfeiffer were in every scene in this movie I probably would tack on at least one additional star. Their characters, Penguin and Catwoman, are developed so well they elevate the film from the rather dubious crop of comic book that have been made. Burton's direction and visual flare, and Elfman's genius score are a perfect pair yet again. It's a huge improvement over the first ""Batman,"" which was low on story and high on Jack Nicholson's scene-chewing. It's a hell of a lot spookier and darker than its predecessor, making it more faithful to its comic book source. If the movie were just overall better, De Vito's Penguin would go down as movie history's wickedest villains (he's like a Charles Manson with lame wings), and Pfeiffer's Catwoman would be among the silver screen's greatest female roles. The uneven script stifles the flow of the movie, and I'm sure the studio tinkered with Burton's singular vision with its need for blockbuster box office and perpetual tie-in merchandising.",Batman Returns
366,maryolalov,Michael Keaton is back and his Batman is worse than ever,4,7 January 2019,"I'm quite amazed by the fact that so many people enjoy this movie and that there're even people out there who call it a masterpiece. It's nothing more than an average or even below average movie.Probably the only thing that this movie did good is the portrayal of the Penguin. Danny Devito is a great actor and surely did an excellent job. His make up is also on point and very well made. But everything else is just awful.I'm going to skip the criticism of Michael Keaton's Batman because it is without doubt the worst portrayal of the Batman so far. It's not only the witless facial expressions that he makes, but also the robotic like movements that make the Batman seem more like a tree rather than a fighter.The script is a bit better than the one in Batman(1989) but still requires lots of improvement. As for the plot, all I can say is that it is nothing special and unoriginal.",Batman Returns
367,Tim-177,"Everyone is well-cast, but...",6,11 March 1999,"I liked this movie, but not as much as I liked the 1989 original.  Danny DeVito and Michelle Pfeiffer, both of whom I like, both overplayed their parts.  Michael Keaton practically just slid back into his character from last time.  I think my favorite actor in ""Returns"" is Christopher Walken, mainly because he didn't ham it up too much.  BE PREPARED FOR THE VIOLENCE IN THIS MOVIE.  There's more violence in this than in the 1989 original; a friend of mine who saw this movie with me calls it ""The Oswald Cobblepot Bloodbath.""",Batman Returns
368,bak-67163,almost as good as the previous movie.,8,5 February 2020,"In the 3 years since the last movie, Tim Burton still has yet to read a comic book, but once again he makes a movie that is pretty entertaining.",Batman Returns
369,JackReese,The Glory of Gotham,8,3 December 2000,"Tim Burton directs yet another astonishing film in which the Dark Knight protects the city he claims as his own.  The set design is once again gloriously dark and its night canvas sets the tone.  Michael Keaton reprises the role only he is careful enough to understand and brings the mental, emotional and brilliant character to life.  Danny DeVito does an extraordinary job as Oswald Cobblepot, The Penguin, alongside Michelle Pfeiffer as the Catwoman.  Christopher Walken plays his character well, he just gets in the way sometimes.  Micheal Gough portrays Alfred Pennyworth with astounding praise and sarcasm, and Pat Hingle's Commissioner Gorden was not put to it's full potential, but is reasonable instead.  The plot is dark and almost too twisted, even for us, but yet we understand that this is the way the Batman is to be portrayed, a dark shadow of a necessary evil.  And despite what Joel Schumacher says about the first three films of Bruce Wayne being a whiny ""whoa is me, my parents are dead"", there is no mention of Bruce's parents anywhere in this film.  (After all Joel, we dealt with that in the first film, YOU were the one who brought it back in the third, and by the way, the death of Bruce Wayne's parents is the driving force of Batman, if he forgets about his parents, he fails to be the Batman) You'd think people would research these things! But oh Tim Burton did!!! His artistic genius prevails yet again, and so does this masterpiece!",Batman Returns
370,gmaileatsyourlunch,A film mostly about Tim Burton and Danny Elfman,3,16 January 2021,"Batman Returns came at a time when Tim Burton and Danny Elfman had become a superstar team and forgot what landed them there. Whereas films like Pee Wee's Big Adventure and Beetlejuice had lots of over-the-top set pieces, surreal themes and bounding music, they also had a lot of good heart, charm, fresh ideas and fun storylines.Batman Returns is pure style over substance, and the style isn't even pleasant to look at or listen to. It's dirty, gritty and alienating. None of Batman's gadgets or action scenes feel exciting, inventive or original, and yet they're presented as if they were. You often feel like you're missing something, but no, there just isn't much there once you strip away the surrealist style and bombastic sounds.In contrast to Nicholsan's Joker, there's zero charisma in DeVito's Penguin nor Michelle Pfieffer's Catwoman. And in the latter's case, her looks, which are covered up most of the time, can't save her.Speaking of sound, Danny Elfman shows zero restraint and just can't help but cram his bombastic soundtrack into your ears even when nothing on the screen warrants it. It quickly wears you out and you occasionally feel the need to cover your ears just to get a break from it. The opening score is suitably epic and memorable, and that's not the problem. It's in the music score throughout the rest. Every single little thing elicits these overly loud baritone romps that stop being a soundtrack and instead become rather obvious attempts to make the audience pay attention to the soundtrack more than the film itself. At least in the first Batman, Elfman's score gets a break during Prince's music tracks. Not so, here. It's non-stop and over-saturated, and your ears will beg for it to stop.While Burton and Elfman are trying to one-up each other - Burton with visual style and Elfman with music - Burton forgot he was actually supposed to tell a story and have compelling characters. His self-indulgence tanks the entire film. It doesn't work as an action film and it doesn't work as a stylistic film. It just sucks. And because it's so loud, you can't just close your eyes and tune it out to feel like you got your money's worth. It won't let you.I worked at a movie theater when Batman Returns was in theaters, and the very best part of it is the song Face to Face by Siouxsie and the Banshees which plays during the closing credits. It's the only time in the whole experience of this movie you don't feel like it's trying to blast you out of the theater with its visuals and obnoxious soundtrack. I remember people exiting the theater looking tired and disoriented, feeling like they were supposed to like what they just watched, but confused about why they didn't.Batman Returns was a box office success, but critical viewers knew it was not a great film and you can only make so many of those before the audience will turn on you. I don't think Burton made another film that truly follows up his earlier work until Big Fish in 2003. Burton and Elfman are the classic example of great talents that need a steady and restraining hand for them to perform at their best.",Batman Returns
371,i77310,Good but not better than the first. Missing The Joker.,6,11 May 2010,"I saw this film when I was still very young. I have no idea who Tim Burton was then. I was quite surprised to finally know he actually managed to direct films with no Johnny Depp in it.This is a good film with introduction to new villain like the Penguin (brillantly acted by Danny DeVito as he really irks and makes me just want to bash his head with his pointy umbrella), Batman's love interest- The Catwoman, who was also a villain at first but turns out to be good in the end.Somehow, no other Batman villain seems to match the evil genius and a sort of magnetic presence like The Joker, who can make any actor who plays him famous (Jack Nicholson, Heath Ledger). Mention Batman and I immediately think of The Joker, with his famed purple suit and wild fuzzy green hair and that crazed smile. I actually love him more than the Batman. He is such a colorful and unpredictable character, the No.1 match to Batman's troubled and dark one.This film is good, but without the Joker the film seems incomplete and hollow. Something just makes me uncomfortable watching the film. The ending is not explosive and very stale. Everyone knows Batman always wins.I hate the Penguin, wish more can be said about the love between Batman and Catwoman. The film is only okay, mostly uninteresting, a bit below my expectation from a Tim Burton film. It is good enough for me with only one viewing. I like the first one more.",Batman Returns
372,goey312,Goey Rating: DM (Decent Movie),7,28 June 2005,"A sequel to the original Batman movie, this movie is a dark super-hero movie. of course that really fits in with all of the batman movies. i will have to admit this movie didn't hold my attention quite as well as i would have liked but it was pretty good. The storyline was creative having two villains instead of the normal one villain that super-hero movies tend to have. I wasn't a huge fan of the Panguine and the whole story plot was just a little to complex for me.if your into this newly lighted super-hero crazy this is a definite movie to watch before the new one comes out. however those with kids should beware it does have some adult themes in it.",Batman Returns
373,pfsombrero,Good job Tim Burton!,7,17 May 2019,"I must congratulate Tim Burton for managing a truly high level sequel. After the success of: Batman (1989), it was not easy to propose a film that could stand comparison with such an important predecessor, but Tim Burton succeeded, bringing to the screen a much more serious Batman, with even darker tones , intriguing and engaging. The style of Burton, as for the first film, adapts perfectly to the character of the dark knight. Set design and soundtrack are excellent and the performances, by antagonists, by Danny DeVito and Michelle Pfeiffer: unforgettable. So, I recommend this movie to all Batman and cine-comics fans. Greetings and see you at the next review.",Batman Returns
374,kmthomas-1,The Beginnings of Bad Sequels,5,26 June 2003,"Michelle Pfeiffer as Catwoman.  Cool.  Keaton reprising Batman.  Also cool. Danny DeVito...waitaminnit: why is Danny DeVito in this movie?  why is there an additional ""big bad,"" thus taking away from the character development between Bruce Wayne and Selina Kyle?  This is the inevitable simple equation that every comic adaptation proves, but Hollywood either doesn't care or isn't smart enough to catch on: 1 superhero + 1 supervillain = great movie, while 1 superhero + X supervillain(s) = bad movie.  Superman and Batman prove the first half of this equation.  Superman 2 is an example of a rare exception (as there are to all rules); however, it had Superman 1 to help build up Zod as a nemesis.  X-Men barely survived it.  All subsequent Batfilms died as a result of it.  Too many characters to focus upon requires either 18 hours of footage or the elimination of characters.  You can't build characters without scenes of them.  You can't have scenes of them if you have to have scenes of the other 13 characters in the film.  Pfeiffer as Catwoman is the only saving grace of this film.",Batman Returns
375,mst86,easily better than the original,6,1 January 2000,"The second installment into the Batman series is better than the first.  The plot is great and so is the acting.  What makes this better than the original is that it lightens up a bit.  It has more comedy here and there and Bruce Wayne isn't as bitten by revenge.The story goes like this:  The Penguin and Catwoman team up to try and destroy Batman.  The Pengiun becomes mayor and makes Batman hated. Meanwhile, Selina Kyle (Catwoman) develops a relationship with Bruce Wayne (Batman).6/10 stars",Batman Returns
376,neil.harris,Why this film is perfect,10,27 January 2000,"Batman Returns. Summed up in simple terms as one of the greatest films of all time. Why? For me it sums up all the good things about the comic book, keeps true to the origins (mostly), and adds extras that only serve to excite us further. The bat-gadgets that so fascinated us in the first movie are back, better than ever, and the villians are just supurb.Michaels Keaton and Gough are back, as are Pat Hingle as Gordon, and whoever played the mayor. It is important to keep these key players the same, because while not actually relying on the first movie, this can say to the viewer 'Remember when this happened?', and we can identify with them more.Thats where the next two films failed, because the images were so different than we were used to, we were watching a completely different series of characters which no one could identify with.Penguin and Catwoman were played excellently by DiVito and Pfeiffer (very sexy), and Walken was good as the evil (if rather confused) Max Schrek. The batmobile was great again, and the costumes were still believeable, little did we know that this would be the last time we would see them as they were intended. A great foray into fantasy. Neil",Batman Returns
377,willow-46,Too weird to be good,6,14 November 2000,"But then again, it IS a fantasy movie, so it's not bad. Visually it is quite nice but I would prefer a better 'do for Christopher Walken, although it makes him look like a bad guy. The leads Micheal Keaton, Danny DeVito and Michelle Pfeiffer are great, and in my personal opinion, Keaton is much better than George Clooney. Make-up and a fake nose does wonders for DeVito, and so does a catsuit for Pfeiffer, who looks absolutely stunning doing cartwheels in that slinky little number! The idea of the umbrellas are really freaky but cute at the same time. Where does the duck come from, anyway?? Tim Burton is really good with these kind of stuff and I wouldn't say this was a bad movie but it was obviously cartoonish. Burton's Sleepy Hollow was a much better film, but that's another matter. If only they didn't make any more sequels...",Batman Returns
378,hanifmuhammad92,A sequel almost as impressive as its predecessor. An all time Classic!,8,13 October 2012,"Everything that was good about the original Batman is back in The second movie. This is a fantastic film with top notch performances, stage design,atmosphere,music,and character development. I adore this movie almost as much as the original. I thought that soundtrack from Danny Elfman was even better this time around that it was in the original. He has outdone himself. Its intense, frightening, bittersweet, tragic and out of this world! Its quite a magnificent feat to behold. Michael Keaton is brilliant as The Caped Crusader. He is a total Badass and doesn't seem to be afraid of anything. He is a quiet intellectual who can work his way out of problems that no one else could even dream of. He gets himself into trouble in this movie and we are reminded that Batman is still a human like the rest of his and is not invulnerable. The film's art direction is just as dark as it was in Batman but this time its much more Gothic and Halloween like. This film's tone shifts quite a lot. It is quite a mouthful but never becomes crowded or overbearing. There are moments when the film is very somber and bittersweet and their are moments when the film is bizarre and disturbing. All of these moments are handled brilliantly in the film and so are the characters. This was an incredible important film in Batman cinema history. It introduced the two villain per film formula that every Batman film proceeding this would Imitate. To say that Michelle Pfieffer played Catwoman would be almost rhetorical and perhaps the understatement of the century. She was The Freaking Catwoman! We meet Selina Kyle before she becomes cat-woman. This film does a masterful job of making audience understand the character and her pain and Isolation. Her transformation from Mousy Secretary to fierce feline is Brilliant, memorizing, and Unforgettable. The scene when Selina Kyle trashes her apartment is heartbreaking yet we also feel a catharsis and a sense of release with her. The scene is unnerving and hard to watch but it makes perfect sense for the character. When She becomes Catowmen she is sexy, and frankly quite scary. I absolutely loved Pfieffer's cat-woman. She keeps you on your toes the entire ride and it is a riot to watch her go at it with Batman or embark on random rampages. I thought Danny Devito gave a performance of a lifetime as The Penguin. His performance will most likely never be rivaled or surpassed. He was an animal. He scared the daylights out of me as a child when He bite that man's nose off. I loved every line of dialog that came out of his mouth. He was truly menacing and disappeared into the character. The makeup for The Penguin was freaking awesome. The character's story was classic and beautifully told in a way that I have never seen before. Its easily the best role that I have ever seen Danny Devito in. Christopher Walken was great as Max Schrek. A power hungry bully that wants to control all of Gotham's energy with a power-plant that will actually steal power from Gotham. This movie is a rare Gem that will delight and memorize audiences for years to come. Due to its impeccable writing, excellent characters and haunting atmosphere. It is an absolute Marvel of a film!",Batman Returns
379,J5iftY5iveXtreme,7.5/10 - Burton's imagination gone wild,8,28 August 2012,"""Batman Returns"" is a strange movie. It may not be a film for everyone. Back in its day, it caused such a fuss, and it's easy to see why. This is a very dark film, and twisted, too.There's a scene where Selina Kyle falls from several stories, gets resurrected by cats, and goes bat-sh** crazy, stabbing her stuffed dolls with a knife.The Penguin is such a creepy character. In one scene, he shakes another guy's hand with a dismembered man's hand, and in another, he bites another man's nose and leaves it bleeding.Yes, this is a dark, twisted, bizarre film. In fact, more so than the first one.Yet strangely, it manages to be a really fun film! Here is director Tim Burton at his whimsical best, creating a blend of playful imagination and dark fantasy, and he's doing it in that dark, playful way that only he can do. The scene where Batman takes on the Penguin's Red Circus Gang is a lot of fun to watch, with the different members of the Red Circus Gang appearing in many strange, bizarre forms, and Batman dispatching them with a variety of different methods, like rod that pop out of the Batmobile's wheels to trip them.In fact, while being darker than the first ""Batman,"" this also manages to be more cartoony. There's no forgetting the Penguin's army of rocket-launching, well, penguins, which look funny with those mind control devices on their heads. And, while being silly, it has charm, something lacking in the ridiculous scenes of ""Batman & Robin."" This is not a realistic film, and Burton makes no attempt to. After all, Selina Kyle is not only resurrected by cats, for some reason, she also gains the ability to fight and be adept with the whip. Are these magical cats? There's nothing to prepare the audience for these unexpected supernatural scenes. In fact, my only major gripe with the film may be the script: It's not exactly the most coherent in the world.The first ""Batman"" movie was gritty and had the vibe of a crime/noir film. But ""Batman Returns"" throws away all that, and here instead is this Tim Burton world that is strange and dark, but what an enchanting world it is! It is so imaginative, with great-looking sets, like the Penguin's hideout, and great scenes, too.The first ""Batman"" had a lot of great, spectacular scenes, and this sequel follows up with just as much spectacle, such as the scene where Batman destroys the Penguin's headquarters. Tim Burton is very creative with the scenes, and there are some memorable images, like when the Penguin takes his hands and forms the shadow of a bat on the ceiling.The story is more complex than the first. The first film was mainly about Batman versus the Joker. Here, on the other hands, are several interlinking stories: The Penguin's attempt to get revenge on society, for it rejected him for being deformed; Selina's/Catwoman's desire for revenge against her boss; the evil Max Shreck's plot involving his nuclear power plant; and on top of it all is Batman's quest to stop them.It is said that Batman is reduced to a mere supporting character in his own movie, and this is no exaggeration. The villains do, in fact, get a lot of screen time. But it is all these interlinking characters that make the movie. The point isn't so much about Batman undergoing a major character arc as it is about how he relates to the other characters.Yet, in whatever scenes he has, the audience gets to know enough about Batman/Bruce Wayne. We first see him in a dark mansion, brooding alone in a dark room. This alone tells us that not only is he a recluse, he's lonely as well. In one scene, Alfred calls him a ""lonely man-beast."" But lonely as he may be, he may have perhaps found love in the form of Selina Kyle, whose alter-ego happens to be none other than Catwoman, one of Batman's enemies.The romance here is perhaps more interesting than the first. Here, for the first time, is a love interest who is very much like Batman/Bruce—perhaps too much. Here are two people who dress up in costumes and live double lives, and the doubles lives is what makes the romance interesting: While in one form they romance each other, in the other, they fight. Both of them have ""a dark side."" As Batman says, they're ""the same, split right down the middle."" The film treats Batman as being essentially the same as his two villains. They're all freaks and misfits. All of them are seeking revenge, with Batman being the only one who's on the right side. The real villain in the story is Max Shreck, who just seeks power.The film ends with a beautiful scene. Bruce/Batman has apparently lost Selina/Catwoman. He's in his car being driven by Alfred. All of a sudden, he sees a stray cat, and he decides to take it inside. Then he sees a silhouette of Catwoman, but it quickly vanishes. The car drives away, and above them, the Bat-signal looms in the sky. All of a sudden, the head of Catwoman appears, and she watches the car drive away. She's alive, but Selina and Bruce can't be together. ""Batman Returns"" is perhaps the most bittersweet in the series.It's easy to get turned off by this movie. There are those weird, bizarre scenes, after all. The plot might not make a lot of sense to first-time viewers. For me, this is one of those films has to ""grow on you."" This may not be a film that's easy to get into. Some will probably never get into it at all. But for those who do, they'll be given a taste of Tim Burton's imagination at its fullest, as well as a beautiful, haunting experience.",Batman Returns
380,steve_baillargeon,The true Dark Knight returns,10,15 April 2006,"Batman Returns is more Gothic and somber than its predecessor, and I like it a lot. Also, the scenery is more darker, and the entire environment is saddening along with the soul-chilling music composed by the so-talented Danny Elfman.However, I didn't like the idea to make the Penguin a monster, unlike to the comic books, where he's human. Even if he looks like a monster, he shows well that he possesses a human dignity, and I felt very sorry for him when he saw the tombstones of his late parents. But still, he was a dangerous villain in fact, and he needed to be stopped.Michael Keaton made a ""tour de force"" with his return as the Dark Knight, and this time he's powerful as in the original Batman. It's not difficult to understand why he's called Batman in public sometimes...Also, Michelle Pfeiffer is so sexy and well-fitted in her role, and she gave a faithfully performance as the female villain/crimefighter dressed as a cat. Really, the actors did all a masterful work with Batman Returns, which made it a successful movie.If you liked Batman, watch its awesome sequel, cause it's very worthy for all the Dark Knight's hard-core lovers.Steve Baillargeon",Batman Returns
381,Digory,Merry Christmas Alfred...,7,25 December 2008,"It was around 1995 when I saw Batman Returns (I was five) and the image of the Penguin carrying an umbrella that functions as both a machine gun and sword (and many more) was iconic. I remember a lot from this movie than the first one. One of the reasons why I enjoy this is because of their choice of Keaton and his take on Batman even though this is his second time.Tim Burton skillfully depicts Gotham City the way I envisioned it, well at least way before Batman Begins came out. Without looking at the characters and Gotham itself, I could feel the ""gothic"" ambiance which probably gave the city its name. Michael Keaton as Batman, although only second to Christian Bale for me, does a great job as the brooding creature of the night and as the civilized Bruce Wayne. But, from my observations, his role here seems reduced compared to the first, it felt like he only had a few lines. Speaking about roles, boy did Commissioner Gordon lost a lot of his already minor role. DeVito rules as the Penguin. You kind of pity him during the first parts of the movie then as it progresses you find him even more pitiful as a misunderstood villain. I guess Pfeiffer's Catwoman was right-on but I honestly didn't understand her primary role throughout the duration of the movie. Christopher Walken is wonderful as always. For some reason, he bears a slight resemblance to Jack Sparrow and even shows a hint of his personality here. Everything in this movie seems to fall into the right place if you disregard realism and errors like how the Penguin got a wacky replica of the Batmobile in just a few days (maybe it's possible), how a duck could work as an amphibian vehicle, why a member of the Penguin's circus gang had to fight Batman while swallowing a sword when it would be easier to hold it with his hands, how the bat-signal formed perfectly in the sky, etc. I believe Returns didn't get a lot of attention, so that sucks. Overall this movie is superb as a Batman film and, if you like, a Christmas film as well. It's better than Batman '89 in some ways but again it just lacked attention.",Batman Returns
382,gidmid,Danny DeVito is better then Nicholson!,8,6 March 2019,"This movie was way better then the first one! Don't get me wrong, i liked the first one aswell(7/10) and sadly Burton still doesn't care about the character of Batman but this darker but in some ways campier tone works really well.
Oh and did I mentiond DeVito's performance? Yeah he's really awesome in this movie.",Batman Returns
383,davidking,Did I miss something?,4,13 July 2001,"I like Danny DeVito.  I've seen him act before and I was impressed.  Iliked Danny DeVito's rendition of the Penguin, well portrayed like thecomic book villain, but I can't say as much for the film.Batman Returns introduces the Penguin as a pitiable child abandoned byhis parents and raised by penguins, but I really can't figure out howexactly that relates to the rest of the film, even with the reference toit later on.  Why would a person so rejected be so eagerly welcomed bythe films only non-super villain?The catwoman side story also failed to make much sense, or inspire me. The Selina Kyle of the comic books is more of a semi-renegade thief witha heart, but that doesn't explain why she would fall for the Batman.  Ican understand her appreciation for the cat, but the character wasn'texplained as well as I thought it could be.I'll admit it has been a while since I saw Batman Returns, but I didn'tlike it much then, and I doubt a second viewing would significantlychange that opinion.  The first Batman had plenty of jokes to keep themood somewhat light, Batman Returns lacked that sense of humor.",Batman Returns
384,ostlerb-02853,Horrible script,1,14 August 2021,"Of all the possibilities that Warner Bros had, they chose the worst one. Im not sure if The Penguin is part of the DC comics, but if so, then Warner Bros should have chosen a different direction. I realize that, in the DC universe, there are some supernatural forces at work, but there should still be boundaries. Magical penguins should not be within those boundaries. They should have had Batman fighting more crime bosses.",Batman Returns
385,canadianfreak_17,Batman Returns made the series,8,2 July 2005,"Of all the four films in the Batman series (I say 4 because I truly do not include the new Batman Begins in that series) Batman Returns had the best story, plot, sub plots and best acting. Michael Keaton returned as a very respectable Batman and Bruce Wayne this time taking on the likes of the grotesque Pengiuin of the sewer played by Danny Devito. Christopher Walken effectively plays a very shrewed and borderline evil business man Max Schreck who will do anything, even kill to get what he wants. The there is Michelle Pfeiffer who plays nerdy, insecure Selina Kyle who is Max Schreck's assistant. Whe she stumbles on his huge devious plan he takes care of her and Catwoman, the best villain in the series is born. Michelle P stole the show for me as the very dark, seductive and sexy Catwoman. Selina Kyle and Bruce Wayne are attracted to one another and Batman and Catwoman are attracted to one another. The best subplot of the entire Batman series. Definitely is underrated here at IMDb IMO. It was one of the better films to come out of the 90's. I watch it over and over and never get tired of it.",Batman Returns
386,Nephalim,Best Batman,10,24 February 2004,"The best thing about Batman Returns is that, when you watch it, you manage to forget how much Joel Schumacher has destroyed the franchise. Batman Returns takes these famous characters and explores them deeply and disturbingly. What Burton started in Batman, he continues in this wildly stylistic sequel.Though in terms of writing and acting, the greatest success is celebrated by the villains. In Catwoman, we see Michelle Pfeiffer transform from a twitchy, nervous, and undertrod secretary into a dark, confident psychopath. Pfeiffer's performance in Returns is one of the most unsung in the history of film. We see her degenerate from scene to scene, slowly losing control, until the breaking point at the climax.Then there's the Penguin, bent on revenge against all the silver spooners who thrived where his parents abandoned him. His interaction with society can be easily compared to that of Edward Scissorhands. When they first recieve him, the city is thrilled at the novelty of his otherness, but they turn on him in an instant. The only difference is that the Penguin deserves it. In the end, he's abandoned once again, by the city, by his co-conspirators, and finally, by his avian minions themselves.Batman Returns takes what could have easily just been another pop culture action film and turns it into a twisted reflection on some very disturbed characters. Gotham City, under the direction of Burton, remains dark and gothic, unstained by the neon and blacklights that Schumacher would later invade it with.Returns is, and probably will always be, the last Batman movie to stay true to what Batman was truly about, a dark man, in a dark city, trying to find the light.",Batman Returns
387,adammcadam,classic burton/elfman,10,14 June 2015,"First of all, this film isn't meant to be 100% serious, it's a Tim Burton film, it's ""weird"". Some things are just there because they're artistic, abstract, dark, weird. The world isn't supposed to make sense. You have to free yourself from thinking ""that would never happen, that looks stupid"" etc, to enjoy a Burton film, and look for the underlying emotion, artistic appreciation, humour, symbolism etc instead.The thing I enjoyed most about this film is the soundtrack, I think it's great, and the music I enjoyed most is the strings sounding so cat like, miaowing, for cat woman.. if you didn't notice it watch the film again, the strings really emulate a miaowing sound. The soundtrack to this and the first Burton/Elfman Batman film are great, to any student of music I'd recommend them because they do some interesting things such giving the hero dark music, the villain happy waltz music which even though its non diegetic music which seemingly no other character in the film is aware of, he dances around happily to (symbollising his insanity maybe), then we have Batman Returns with the great strings emulating cat sounds, great scenes like Selina going a bit mad (I actually find that scene quite emotional and the music great too!). They are great films, you can get a lot out of them, but I guess you have to have an artistic mind as well and know what you're looking for maybe.",Batman Returns
388,maple_leafs_kickass,The Dark Knight Strikes Again,8,28 January 2007,"One of the best representations of Batman the world of cinema has ever seen. Burton gives us an even darker version of Batman. There is the one thing being the fact that this film concentrates more on the villains whether than Batman, but considering the brilliance of this film I thought it all worked out very well.Why? Burton juggled the actual comics continuity of Catwoman and Penguin and made them characters of tradegies. As a Die Hard Batman fan, I thought this was an excellent move, at least as far as cinematics go. I think this because the villains have more of a connection personally to Batman cause as we all know, Batman is a character of tradegy himself, not to mention a someone of purest darkness. Catwoman and Penguin are placed into that very darkness he is but in different doses and they have different morals. As a viewer, it was a very smooth combination of characters.As Batman, Michael Keaton makes a grand return. The best Batman by far, Keaton's frightening, and sometimes even depressing facial expressions brought out who Batman is. You can tell of the personal conflict and struggle he copes within himself. That was the beauty of Keaton's performance. He doesn't have to even say anything, you can just tell its there. Michelle Pfeifer was hands down fabulous. A grade A performance as Catwoman, so seductive, and just about what everybody else said about her at the time of this films release. Not to mention the fact that she brought out the tortured soul within perfectly as well. Equal in Keaton's performance as the Bat, Pfeifer pulled off his feminine opposite and with such style. DeVito couldn't have been a better choice for Penguin. Cruel, Sadistic, Funny, and Sad he highlighted them all within the character, and I'm happy Burton went with him. If I'm not mistaken Dustin Hoffman was at one point considered for the role and I don't think that would have worked out good.The movie itself is visually stunning once again, the view of Gotham was perfect, at times I felt like I was actually in a comic book, cinematic art to a marvelous perfection (if that makes any sense). Not to mention Danny Elfman's staggering theme.A perfect Batman film.",Batman Returns

I thought I was seeing things with the 1/10, my word.....this movie is legendary and is a fantastic sequel! I know we are all entitled to our own opinions, however, to compare this to Superman IV.....too far, WAY TOO FAR. Excellent director. Fantastic cast. Over the top characters (like the comics) Dark and gothic...like a Batman should be. My opinion, the haters leaving 1/10 ratings and comments are kids clearly of the Chris Nolan era.

390,druryd,Worse Than I Remembered,5,27 November 2002,"I bought this movie on DVD recently and this is the first time I have viewed it since originally seeing it in the theater.  All I can say is it is much worse than I remembered.  Once again as in the original Batman movie, the villains are the star and not Batman.  We get no new character development of Batman, no look into his motivations, psyche or past.  The character of the Penguin is bad enough, but the origin of Catwoman is absolutely absurd. Let's see if you are pushed out of a window and fall to what surely would be your death and then a mob of cats gathers around you, you will wake up a world class gymnast, an expert at martial arts and a master with a whip. You can also survive being shot 3 or 4 times at point blank range and survive and electric shock strong enough to fry someone else, heck if you get all this, push me out the window right now!  Save your money and your time and avoid this turkey and the following installments of the series, because it only gets worse.  One tip to Warner Brothers, whom I still assume own the rights to Batman.  How about a Batman movie, about Batman",Batman Returns
391,Tom16uk,"All round its perfect, one of the best. You can't fault it",10,25 May 2005,"Any Batman fan will know just how great the films are, they've been a major success. Batman Returns however is by far the best film in the series. A combination of excellent directing, brilliant acting and settings makes this worthy of watching on a night in.Tim Burton, who directed this movie, has specifically made sure that this film gives a realistic atmosphere and he's done a great job. Danny Devito (Penguin man) is a man who has inherited penguin characteristics as a baby, and grown up to become a hideous and ugly...thing! Michelle Pfiffer plays the sleek and very seducing 'Catwoman' after cats had given her there genes from being bitten. The result in both the character changes is excellent and both Catwoman and Penguin man play a very important role in this excellent film. The mysterious Catwoman is great fun to watch - her classic sayings and a funny part in which skips with her whip in a jewelry shop adds such fun to the film. Danny Devito also does well, his ability to impersonate some strange creature was vital, and he adds a great atmosphere to the film that takes us back to the dull sewers where he lives.You can't forget Batman though. Micheal Keaton once again pulls of a comfortable performance, and shows us a different side to Batman. His affection is let loose when he confronts Catwoman at the end of the film, and his meetings with her when she's a normal person, Selina Kyle, result in him being seduced badly in his own home. There's a clever part after this when they leave, and the film is full of great scenes. Its worth noting that Bruce Wayne's Bat mobile is not used as much as in the other Batman films, as close combat and story telling scenes make up this film.The winter setting is created perfectly in Gotham City with most of the scenes being set at night, and with the town being filled with snow. Therefore, if you watch this film during the summer like I have, it doesn't feel the same. Best watch it during the winter.Overall, its an amazing movie. All the credit goes to Tom Burton and the cast, they've done an incredible job.",Batman Returns
392,tbuchalski,"Batman Returns: My Good, Bad, and Ugly",7,25 May 2019,"The Good:
Much of what makes this film unique is wrapped up in Tim Burton's aesthetic that was still somewhat new upon release, and yet to be as defined as Burton's films have done in the decades since. But, as I address below, because this film is more a Burton film than a Batman film the stylistic choices detract from the film's tone and content rather than complement them. Danny DeVito's performance is the only real bright spot of this film. While critical reviews vary on his turn as The Penguin, it was even, committed, and criminally lecherous. DeVito really delivers on Burton's intent for the character even if Burton doesn't finish with his own delivery for the film as a whole.The Bad:
Burton's choice to replace Furst as Production Designer for this film, Bo Welch, continued with the established German Expressionism aesthetic of Batman (Tim Burton, 1989) in a much bigger way as might be expected of a sequel. The film goes as far as making literal nods to the film and art movement of the early 20th century in the character and costume design of the film's chief villain, Max Shreck. Visually, this film benefits in the same ways as its immediate predecessor, but fails in that it's more a Tim Burton film, as had been and would continue to be established, than it is a Batman film. And, the detachment is more than the film can sustain beyond its initial box office run.The Ugly:
The easy choice for a film that's done it better is The Dark Knight (Christopher Nolan, 2008), and it's the easy choice for a reason. It did everything a sequel needed to do, and it did everything a Batman sequel needed to do. Christopher Nolan's trilogy grounded Batman in reality, which hadn't yet been done, and that added level of excitement to the narrative as it unfolded that the fantasy and stylized nature of previous films negated. With the right director finally at the helm of a Batman film the cast really shines, Heath Ledger in particular. The debate on the better Joker can rage for eternity, but there's no real comparison between Ledger and Nicholson. Ledger is the darker and more convincing psychopath that Batman's conflicted duality needs as its opposition.",Batman Returns
393,BillZane,Who is this movie about?,3,27 March 1999,"I went to this movie to see BATMAN.  I also enjoyed seeing Catwoman.  The only characters I really didn't like the Penguin and Shreck.  Well, in terms of time spent on screen, this movie was about the Penguin and Shreck.  The far more interesting Catwoman storyline only received about twenty minutes of time, and Batman himself was seen for maybe ten, fifteen minutes.  A Batman-Catwoman movie would have been great, but the addition of the other two villains was just too much.",Batman Returns
394,ammarjamal,Brilliant,8,20 October 2013,"This Movie is definitely Tim Burton's best movie in the 90's, it gives the viewer the batman vibe that was untouched for years, in this film we see a different batman, a batman that has returned but this time he is more bat than man.I enjoyed Tim Burton's ""spooky"" take on batman, his directing seemed to be very dark the camera angles he chose however seemed to give the viewer a slight uncomfortable experience, which is not necessarily a bad thing since it makes the viewer get more engaged with the film.As a viewer I really enjoyed the story and how it was structured, as we begin with a short back-story about the penguin, and then we see how Bruce Wayne has been doing after he defeated the joker (in the last film) what made the story really appealing was the creepy yet realistic vibe that I personally felt it gave out.The screenplay is funny yet creepy, as we see a different version of the penguin, in which he lived in the sewer which I felt really matched the theme of this film, the things the characters said and did really made since I felt that Burton took the names of these characters in a very literal manner, for example cat woman was so much like a cat that she actually kept licking her hands and penguin was so much like a real penguin that he ate raw fish, I think this was what made the film really interesting.Though the casting in this film got negative reviews, I really enjoyed it and felt that it made sense, Dany DeVito who was at the hight of his carrier plays the penguin which was the best interpretation of the penguin to date in my opinion, he made the penguin sound, he ate raw fish, he walked like a penguin, he had penguin hands, he had a penguin like body it was brilliant! I also enjoyed Michelle Pfeiffer's take on cat woman, personally I liked the 60's cat woman more but she was still really good, and creepy as well. Michael Keaton as batman, which we have seen before, was great I think that he is definitely one of the best batmen to date, he was not too dark, he moved like a bat and he fought like a bat, I also enjoyed his take on Bruce Wayne.The props involved with this film were great I loved the bat suit and the bat-mobile in this film is definitely my favorite. Overall, I strongly recommend watching this film as it is a brilliant, fun and creepy batman film it is definitely one of Burton's best movies to date.",Batman Returns
395,jephiachantharath,batman returns: broken down,8,14 June 2012,"By broken down I mean simplified, anyway this was an interesting film when I watched after so many years. When I first watched it, I was about 10 years old, I got it for Christmas on DVD along with the first, and next two films. I was very fond of the movie at the time, I liked the fell of it, the sort of 'Burtonish' feeling you get from most of his movies. Watching it now, I had some problems with the villains in this movie, one being that the penguin is a deformed freak, and Catwoman being some sort of mystical being. I know from the original comic that there origins are much different, but I'm not that big of a stickler so I let it go. The same could be said for the Friday the 13th remake, if you don't know that the villain was suppose to be someone else, and you just took them for who they are, the film feels better. There have been complaints about the film being too dark, or not dark at all. That is where the 'Burtonish' feeling comes in, like the nightmare before Christmas, it has a creepy yet goofy feeling, and the same is for Batman returns.It was this film that made me start watching the other batman films, I could never find the time to watch the original 1989 version, but I watched the others and was disappointed. At of all of the batman films (except the Nolan films) this one is my favorite.",Batman Returns
396,oldchummer,Loose narrative structure,5,9 May 2017,"Batman Returns is one of the missed opportunities in the Batman film series. Tim Burton was given full creative control, and to those who know the production history of the previous movie then you're likely aware Tim didn't really care much for the comic book source material. Screenwriter Sam Hamm kept both of the movies having the most connection to the comics, and while parts of his script drafts are present for both movies they both got rewritten at some point by different writers, for this movie it was Daniel Waters.While Batman's name is in the title, the script doesn't have a clear protagonist in the movie all the time. In most cases your protagonist undergoes some sort of change in their character arc, and the closest we get to this is Selina Kyle/Catwoman, however she shares about the same amount of screen time as Batman, Penguin, and Max Shreck (Christopher Walken. With Selina Kyle we see her go from the timid, lonely, and down on her luck secretary to a mentally unstable vengeful fighter in the Catwoman persona. Since the movie pays a lot of time to other characters there isn't always as much focus on her story as it could've been, as the middle portion of the movie mostly focuses on a bizarre plot of The Penguin running for mayor and teaming up with Catwoman to stop Batman. Catwoman's main motive and goal in the movie is to kill Max Shreck for his attempted murder on her, which isn't focused on for most of her screen time. The most fascinating scenes are the one's she has with Bruce Wayne and Batman whether in or out of costume. This is mostly due to how the character relate and reflect each other's personas. When the movie ends and you realize Bruce and Selina won't end up together it's somewhat sad because you get the sense they'd make each other live happily.The performances in the movie are somewhat good, but are hampered down by sometimes dreadful dialogue (""Eat floor. High fiber.""). The movie's plot bounces around too often to get too invested in any of the subplots. For instance, Max Shreck has a boring plan to monopolize and stockpile the power supply in Gotham, but this plot is abandoned and then the movie chooses to focus on him running a campaign to get Penguin to be mayor of Gotham. Neither plot goes anywhere really, with the latter more being there to create occasional roadblocks for Batman to overcome. The Penguin's main goal is to kidnap and kill all of Gotham's first born children, but this is also abandoned for most of the movie for the mayor subplot and his team up subplot with Catwoman. It's not until the third act when he actually acts on this, and it's easily thwarted by Batman within a handful of minutes. He then all the sudden has an army of penguins with rockets strapped on them intending to shoot at Gotham plaza which is also stopped by Batman in about 2 minutes.There are also very bizarre unexplained occurrences in the plot such as the Penguin somehow having the blueprints to the batmobile and knowing how to sabotage its control system. Selina Kyle, whom there was no indication of knowing acrobatics, martial arts, and how to handle a whip knows how to do all of this when revived from her fall. There's also the silly mirror setup outside Wayne Manor having the Batman emblem, and it leaves you to wonder how many people could just drive by and notice it in Gotham.The movie does have great art direction and cinematography, so it's a very easy movie to look at, but not always the easiest movie to care for. Danny Elfman's score for this movie is almost as good as his score for the first movie, so there's plenty to enjoy with the music. Overall it stands at about a 5.6/10 for me. There was a lot of potential, however, the movie likely would've been better served if the Penguin was removed since he's often tied to the least interesting plots in the movie and would save more time on Catwoman's arc which is by far the most interesting.",Batman Returns
397,mccready-906-458193,Batman Returns is Very Good,9,14 July 2018,"I know it may not be a popular opinion but I really enjoyed this film, almost as much as I loved the first Batman film. It is not very much like the new Christian Bale Batman films, which are much darker and more serious and awesome in their own way, but the first Batman film series started out awesome too, just in a more cartoonish-but-dark kind of way. Of course once Tim Burton left the series went off the rails and turned into complete garbage (Ah-nold as Dr. Freeze?) but this first one with Jack Nicholson's Joker was incredible, and the first sequel was also still very good. Michael Keaton was a great Batman too, and a better Bruce Wayne. Michelle Pfeiffer is also incredibly sexy as Catwoman, and Danny DeVito actually gives a pretty touching performance as The Penguin.",Batman Returns
398,skyblueangel-1,It's Batman! Again!,7,12 July 2005,"First of all, Michelle Pfeiffer was an excellent choice for Catwoman. She did a better job in the leather than in the ""executive assistant"" outfit, and she fit the role perfectly. Danny Davito did a good job as Penguin, but I think the character was a bit too disgusting for me. Okay, let's think about this: He lives in the sewers, he eats raw fish, and bits off people's noses! Ew! But, I digress.Again, I totally think that Michael Keaton still does a good job as Batman, and he does a better job at being Bruce Wayne this time. At least he's falling for a decent woman! Gosh! Thank God there is no more ""Vicki Vale"" *gag*! I hated Vicki Vale!!! She was so stupid and pathetic. At least Catwoman does something.I really didn't care much for the whole ""Schrek helps Penguin become Mayor"" storyline, but at least Batman was falling for a decent woman.So, what happened to Catwoman, anyways??? I think she should come back when they make a sequel to Batman & Robin (which they definitely will, or otherwise I will do it for them), along with the Riddler and Mr. Freeze. But, again, I digress.Overall: It was a good sequel. And thank goodness there is no more Vicki Vale!!!",Batman Returns

Plain cinematography, dumbass villains (except Catwoman, she was more an antihero), and that element that got parents protesting against Warner to refresh the Batman series in a friendlier direction... sex.

401,Allen-31,"not that great, but better than 3 and 4!",5,14 March 2001,"This movie doesn't absolutely stink.  It does have redeeming qualities. Unfortunately, I think its image in evalated in light of ""Batman Forever"" and ""Batman and Robin,"" both of which absolutely sucked.Good points:Michael Keaton returns as Batman.  He is the best to date.Michelle Pfeiffer as Catwoman.  She simply IS Catwoman.  I'd even go so far as to say her interpretation of the character was far more dead on than Nicholson's Joker in the first movie.  If those two had been paired together... the thought sends chills down my spine!Christopher Walken turns in another fine performance as a villanous businessman.The mood is still suitably dark.  Camp is low, and where it exists it is appropriate.Bad points:The interpretation of the Penguin.  This arch-villian was changed so much from the original character (a genius turned to crime) and not for the better (a deformed and ugly circus freak who is just flat-out gross in everything he does).  Danny DeVito is an excellent casting choice, but his character was unlikable without a single redeeming feature.The plot suffers from attempting to cram too many villians and plot lines into the allotted time.  Splitting the screen time between all three undercuts their stories such that a lot of what happens seems contrived and phony -- except for Catwoman.  Her's is the only villian role that seems to flow naturally, maybe because her goals don't involve grand-scale plans, just the thrill of making mayhem while trying to get the best of Batman. Admittedly, it would be a hard choice as to who to leave out as both villians are created or used by Christopher Walken's character.  My personal opinion is that a wholly different script should have been used, but perserving most of the Catwoman story line or expanding it because she's just so damn good.",Batman Returns
402,hanniballe11752,I voted a ten for this movie based on childhood memories,6,3 June 2001,"SILLY ME. Baaadd sequel. It leaves you feeling cold, and unsatisfied. This is a comic book movie-shouldn't we come off feeling like Batman indeed saved the day, and all might be well? That's the feeling we got at the end of the original Batman, and one that is badly missed here. The only thing we feel by the time the movie has reached it's pathetic (anti)climax, is that perhaps Batman SHOULD join Mr.Freeze, Riddler, Posion Ivy, and all the others in Arkham Asylum.Michelle Phiefer is the only point of interest in this dreary mess, and she is given FAR too little screen time. Catwoman deserves her own movie (although not the one Daniel Waters scripted, which was pure 1960's era Bat-campiness), and indeed one is in the works. Too bad the lesser Ashley Judd will play her, according to the latest news. With a better, more fleshed out Catwoman to play Michelle could really SHINE in a role she made, and has yet to top. Danny Devito is awful. Every second he has onscreen is a waste of celluloid. Bury this flick(except for Catwoman's scenes).",Batman Returns
403,MILK-HANDS,A Burton-esque sequel,9,4 July 2001,"If you watch the first two movies of the Batman series back to back, you will notice that they are two very different movies. And while the original is better than the sequel, Batman Returns is still a great movie.It is darkly poetic and emotional, very evocative. The Danny Elfman score is more haunted, and sounds closer to Edward Scissorhands than the original. Batman Returns seems to me to be a collection of images and scenes that stick with you. The best example would be the scene before the credits, in which the Penguin's parents take him through a park, and then the opening credits, in which the baby basket goes through a series of tunnels. Everything is bluish or white, and it always seems to be cold. The performances are not really exceptional, though Chritopher Walken is great as a greedy businessman who allies himself with the Penguin. The thing to remember about the movie though is what you look at. This is the best of the Burton-esque films(eg Eddie Scissorhands, Sleepy Hollow , and Ed Wood). Watch it.",Batman Returns
404,slcagnina,A Wonderful Mess,8,30 October 2008,"First off, this film has no story. It's obvious there were a lot of rewrites during production -- sometimes characters reference a timeline that is impossible, and this is probably because the timeline of the entire story was never known to anyone on the set.That said, the film is kinda brilliant. Pfeiffer is amazing -- and I mean amazing, as Catwoman; she nails the character's inherent sexy darkness and good/bad tendencies. Walken is Walken -- but even more nasty than usual. Devito is not true to the comic book when it comes to Penguin, but he is good and memorable. Keaton is underrated as Batman. And the music and style are pure cinema thrill. True, the 3rd act doesn't work. But the final 2 scenes are knockouts, and it's clear Pfeiffer and Keaton were meant to be in a trilogy that got derailed by this film's kinky darkness. That's too bad, because Pfieffer and Keaton had classic chemistry, and had they acted in a third installment, Joel you know who might not have gotten the chance to destroy Batman for an entire generation of movie fans.",Batman Returns

Michelle Pfieffer and Michael Keaton really made this movie work--as well as the dark backdrop of Gotham City. I don't want to forget Devito or Walken either--they're great villains. Not to be mean, but the skeleton they made for Walken looked almost exactly like him. I really enjoyed the romance of this movie too. Catwoman and Batman were so great together! Tim Burton, as always, is a magician when it comes to directing. He uses black mainly, and this movie really worked with the gloomy look. The bad guys were great! Danny is always marvelous.I just didn't like the fact that Catwoman and Batman were separated! I loved the ending though, cause it did give some kind of hope.

407,k_luifje,Batman part 2 beats Batman part 1,9,13 January 2001,"Batman (1989, directed by Tim Burton) was certainly not a bad movie, especially because Jack Nicholson played his Joker-role with 110% enthusiasm, but Batman Returns (1992, also directed by Tim Burton) is even better. Bad guy Danny De Vito (playing The Penguin) plays great and bad girl Michelle Pfeiffer (as The Catwoman) is the best and most sensual Catwoman ever! Pfeiffer in her Catwomansuit is simply delicious to watch!! She also acts out the cat-habits like licking herself very good. And then there is Micheal Keaton as Batman. He was good in the first film and there didn't change anything, he's still a great Bruce Wayne/ Batman.Another improvement to the first Batman film is the story. In the first movie the main woman (played by Kim Basinger) is in the film, but what she's doing there? I don't know. In Batman Returns The Catwoman has a very important role which pushes the story along.The conclusion is that Batman 2 is better than Batman 1 and that there is nothing bad to say about the film.",Batman Returns
408,eil-2,Better than the original?,8,3 December 2002,"It's a hard decision to make- which is better, Batman or Batman Returns, as both represent the quality end of action cinema superbly. Batman Returns lacks a truly great villain; Danny DeVito's  hammy Penguin is more sympathetic than the Joker but not as charismatic, and the finale stretches the credibility of even a superhero movie. In it's favour, Batman Returns is more exciting than the original, with brilliant performances from Keaton, Pfeiffer and Walken, playing villainous (surely some mistake) businessman Max Shreck. Danny Elfman provides a typically excellent score, and the Christmas stylings work in the film's favour. The things falls apart slightly with the script; dialogue is generally funny (in a good way), but as I mentioned above, the ending was far too silly. Batman Returns is good fun, and possibly superior to the original. It's certainly better than Joel Schumacher's camp garbage take on the caped crusader. 8/10",Batman Returns

However, I do think it is inferior compared to the first, that's why I give it 8 out of 10.Again, Tim Burton does a good job directing this sequel and Michael Keaton pulls off his performance as Batman, but to me, this movie didn't seem as exciting as the first. Again, I liked the action scenes in the movie and I thought it was great when Selina (played by Michelle Pfeiffer) turned into Catwoman because of her out-of-control behaviour and the way she trashed her house.The reason I think some people say this one is better than the first is because it is more action-packed, which is probably what the comic book is supposed to be. I also thought Danny DeVito looked great as the Penguin and played him very well. To me, this is nearly as good as the first and is also recommended for fans of Batman and DC comics. Shame this was the last of the two movies to be directed by Tim Burton. Joel Schumacher took over for the next two, which I will be watching in the next two weeks and Commenting on them.

410,amolghadi,A Comparison of those who played Batman in movies.,6,24 August 2008,"Four Actors: Bale, Kilmer, Keaton, ClooneyBALE: He's leaps and bounds ahead and best among them all. No need for comparison. No need to explain.KILMER VS. KEATON: The real Issue. Kilmer had everything correct about him except one: he was in a Bad Movie. One simply canNOT refer to Bad scenes in a Badly scripted Bad Movie by a Bad Director to explain why the actor was not good to play his character. I understand, Kilmer could have never replaced Bale, but he would have easily replaced Keaton (who even though was a good Batman, WAS a wimp Wayne). Even if we forget that Keaton was the least good looking and had the least physicality required for an ideal Wayne/Batman respectively, we still cannot forget that he never had the ideal Wayne magnetic personality to attract females. He was a plain idiotic wimp as Wayne. Whereas while Kilmer was definitely muscular/handsome of the two, his was unfortunately limited by the Bad Movie itself that he worked in, that did no justice to the character of any roles in it, least of all Batman. Also, we can't forget that Kilmer did play a very good playboy-Wayne of whatever the script allowed him to. That is what is important (where Keaton failed). Because once you're inside the caped costume, it does not matter who is inside it, because nobody's going to recognise you anyway. So the character that must be given more priority is of 'Wayne' where one cannot hide behind a costume. Remember, Kilmer was a good Wayne/UNDERUSED Batman in a bad movie by a bad director. Keaton was a good Batman/wimp Wayne even in an overall OK movie by a very good director. Even worse was that, unlike Keaton who got two opportunities as Batman under the very good director to prove himself as Wayne and yet failed on all points as Wayne, Kilmer never got a second chance to prove himself as Batman even though he had proved himself as Wayne, no... not even under the same hellish director. MY POINT: If the physically strong, play-boyish Kilmer was that good as Wayne under the hellish Schumacher, imagine how great he could have been in costume (Batman) under the very good Burton. CLOONEY: As for 'Batman & Robin', every thing was wrong about it and so was Clooney who only played 'himself' both as Batman/ Wayne. And he will always be remembered for that. Anyway, except when the movies are called 'Syriana', 'Ocean's Eleven' and 'Confessions of a Dangerous Mind', Clooney is all 'himself' everywhere. No Surprises here. I seriously hope they destroy all records/sources of that B&R-crap.My Ranking: 1. Bale 2. Kilmer 3. Keaton. Clooney? Who Clooney?AS for this movie, I don't understand why people call this movie 'Dark'. This movie is Bad because it is TOO dark. Totally unwatchable / unenjoyable for children. On the contrary, the Penguin here, would give the innocent children, traumas for life. Don't ever show this movie to your children. Penguin is a seriously (pun intended) a horror crap here. Too Hideous, No Fun. And what's the use of the movie being Dark when you have No Character Development here. Penguin is a ridiculous villain and they have not shown even a single glimpse of his childhood, that is how the Penguins nurture him which is utterly impossible even in comics/fantasy, especially if they portray the movie and the Penguin as 'serious' and 'dark'. But yes, De Vito has been a good obedient actor here and did what he was told to do efficiently.(P.S.: As for the Comparison between those 'Batmen': Believe me, as the tag-line of 'Terminator 2: Judgement Day' goes - 'It's Nothing Personal.' None of these four actors is my personal favourite. I love Denzel Washington.)",Batman Returns
411,askewglasses,Returns to Glory,9,14 June 2012,"This movie was too dark for the average Batman fans and was not greeted by the critics very positively. I quite like it and think it was a great addition to the series. The sets and images are as dark as the story. Although there are some funny moments the depressing tone over powers them. Keaton pulls of another fantastic performance and his character is still kept a mystery which makes it that much better. But what makes this movie for me is Michelle Pfeiffer as Catwoman. Her character is so twisted, dark and dual that it is so unique from any other versions of this character I've seen. Her performance is just that great. It's dark and depressing and despite many critic opinions I think it's one of the better ever sequels made",Batman Returns
412,iam_moriya,Batman Returns,7,6 August 2007,"I've decided to give you mine opinion on all the old Batman movies. Starting with Batman and ending with Batman & Robin.This movie, Batman Returns, is the second Batman film made by Burton and, this is sad, the last of the old movie to be worth the money. After this there were no good Batman films until Nolan and Goyer decided to make their version of The Dark Knight. With the Joker gone, this film starts to focus on the character it should focus on: Batman. That said, it still gives all the characters a moment to shine. Batman faces two of his deadliest foes: Catwoman and the Penguin, along with the corrupt businessman Max Shreck (named after the guy who played Nosferatu). The cast is great. DeVito was born to play Penguin, Walkens character is the real villain and Michelle Pfeiffer is hot and purrfect as Catwoman (pardon the pun). Once again Burton got the setting right. Gotham during Christmas is a wonderful background to have during this story, that in fact is better then the 89 version. In many things, this is the better Burton film.Then again, on the more important parts, this is the not so good version. Once again Burton got the characters all wrong. Catwoman is, if not true to the original, still good though. She turns into a thief/vigilante after, like the Joker would put it, she had a really bad day. She still is the grey part in Batmans black and white world and she actually makes him love her. So she works and therefor she's okay. The Penguinis was changed radically. He has become a freak who lives in the sewers and is the leader of an ex-circus crew. But, after all, Penguin never was a good villain to begin with. The worst thing is that they took one of the plots, there's more than one, from the old Batman series with Adam West. The Penguin runs for mayor?! WTF is going on? The Penguins other plot is way better but spoiled because of lack of time. That is sad.Still, the ending is great and it is still an enjoyable movie. I'll have it in my collection along with Batman and the new Batman films by Nolan. But Schumachers movies is better of forgotten. ""Merry Christmas, Alfred. Good will towards men... and women."" Batman",Batman Returns
413,soonerpike697,finally Burton got to take the reigns,9,19 July 2002,"This may not be the best 'Batman' film, but it is a very entertaining film nonetheless.  The performances are great.  Warner Brother's finally gave Burton the control he had sought.  He said to hell with the kids, to hell with the critics I want to pay homage to the comic book and make a dark story.  Batman is a very dark hero with a lot of chips on his shoulder. Burton did his best to represent this and at the same time throw in an army of circus freaks and one of the sexiest villians ever.  Danny Devito gives a very convincing performance as an outcast who has lived a hard knock life and is ready to take revenge on the society that only accepts him now out of pity.  Christopher Walken is also very fun to watch even if he cause the screen time to get cut from out hero.  In the end this is a very entertaining film one that all who are a fan of the dark knight should see. It's a shame Mr. Burton couldn't have directed the best because he could have really made a dark villain out Two Face and a very entertaining one out of the riddler.  As for the fourth one not even Burton could have saved that pile of crap.",Batman Returns
414,Diamond_Dog7,"Not as good as the original, but still a decent Batman flick.",10,8 February 2011,"The first Batman film, for me, is astounding. Not only the best Batman film, (I even think it tops Nolan's brilliant vision), I think its one of the best films ever made. So 'Returns had a lot to live up to. And I think with a few changes, a bit of tampering with the plot here and there, it really could have topped it. Firstly, the casting. Brilliant stuff. DeVito's Penguin is grotesque, evil, and quite scary, very menacing. Yet by the end of the film, you ignore all that, and genuinely feel sorry for him. I could imagine no other actor taking that role. It seems The Penguin was created solely for the purpose of DeVito to portray him. Not as good a villain as Nicholson's Joker, but definitely in my list of all time movie villains. Michelle Pheiffer's Catwoman too is purrrfect (sorry, couldn't resist), she takes the role and runs astray (again, sorry!). She is sexy, mysterious, and very alluring. The chemistry between her and Keaton is fantastic. Now, do i really need to talk about the greatness of Keaton as Batman? Well i'm not going to, see my review for Batman 1989, although we all know he is phenomenal. Same with Christopher Walken. Just hearing he's a villain in a Burton Batman film instantly provokes excitement.The plot. Its good, but not great. I find it hard buying the idea of Penguin running for mayor, but i suppose this is fiction after all. Its a Batman film. But i liked the idea of Catwoman and Penguin teaming up, albeit for a short while, and framing Batman. Also an evil corrupt businessman working with Penguin too was a great move. Although, I don't feel the story is as engaging or exciting as the previous film. Its just something about the first film. They really couldn't match it. And no Batman film really has since. Hell, any superhero film for that matter. Ahh screw it, no film really has! Now, the sets. Very, very, dark. Yet, very, very, excellent. Matches the tone of the film perfectly. My only regret is they didn't use Anton Furst's fantastic sets at Pinewood Studios. It was a brilliant piece of architecture, his Gotham City. Nonetheless, these sets are good, and like I said, are very well suited to the atmosphere and overall tone of the film. Overall, 'Returns is a good film. Not as good as the original, but a decent Batman flick. Shame Burton didn't do more. People complained at how dark this was compared to Batman 1989, but that film was dark. You would think they would expect it, I personally thought the darkness of both films is what Batman is all about. He's not a happy camper protecting a brightly neon lighted fantastic spectacle of a city. Nudge Nudge Schumacher...Good film. Great cast. Good music (however i preferred the first films score). And fantastic directing. You can tell in some scenes that the producers let Burton go crazy and do whatever he wanted. The first film is a Batman film, this one, is a Tim Burton film. Its very entertaining, and a good Batman film. And thats all that matters really.",Batman Returns
415,dxia,A Strange Sort of Masterpiece,9,12 September 2004,"I admit my comments on ""Batman Returns"" are probably biased because I have a strange sort of love for this movie, which I remember that Gene Siskel also had with ""Saturday Night Fever."" This was the first movie that I ever owned, and I grew up watching it. Batman was probably my favorite comic book hero when I was young, but I have never read Bob Kane. I completely understand why some Batman fans hate this movie, and it's probably the same reason why I dislike the Lord of the Rings trilogy. When you become familiar with someone's work and form your own interpretations, it becomes difficult to watch someone else change it.But by imagining that this movie has no ties to the original comic book except through the superficial use of its characters, it's not difficult to see an odd sort of genius behind it's making. When Tim Burton created this eerily dark version of Gotham City, he was making an homage to ""The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari,"" which no doubt has had a great influence on his work. Maybe it's true that comic book movies don't blend well with film-noir, but if any comic book had to be chosen to do so, it would be Batman.I believe the reason why some people dislike this movie is because there's no character to identify with. In the first movie, we had Kim Basinger's character, who served as the movie's reality check, and we discovered Batman's world with her beside us. She is one of the heroes of the movie that we could identify with. However, the sequel has no one to guide us through. One of the qualities of film-noir is that there are no heroes, and that's certainly true in ""Batman Returns."" The main characters in this movie are obviously insane and driven by their own selfish motivation: the Penguin with his self-loathing and desire to make others feel his pain, Catwoman with her intense hatred of her boss and wish to free herself from a male-dominated world, Batman on his continuous quest to take revenge for his parents on every criminal he meets, and Max Shreck in his cynical love of profiteering. The characters aren't fighting for world domination or any of the more grandiose plots we see in comic book movies but for satisfying their emotional needs. There isn't a sense of morality or the incessant good vs. evil undercurrent that is so common in this type of a movie. The characters are caricatures of raw human emotions in collision, and it's interesting to note that the Penguin, Catwoman, and Batman don't even really hate each other. They fight only because they stand in each other's way, and as far as the acting goes, it's superbly under-appreciated.Michelle Pfeifer and Danny DeVito give the best performances in their careers. Pfeifer discovered that even though her face is covered by a mask, her lips are all that she needs to convey the seductive malice in her character. DeVito absolutely disappears behind the Penguin in a role that is both disturbing and incredible to see. (Has any other comic book movie ever dared to create a character that takes pleasure in biting a man's nose off?)All in all, the movie contains some brilliant cinematography by Stephan Czapsky, who also worked with Tim Burton on ""Edward Scissorhands"" and ""Ed Wood."" It's filled with strange sexual inhibition and a depressing outlook on the history and future of its characters, and so ""Batman Returns"" isn't a movie that will ever be liked or appreciated by a wide audience. But for those of us that do love the movie, we tacitly agree that it's the best comic book movie ever made, and we smile at all the ""Spiderman 2"" yuppies.",Batman Returns
416,nightdawndaylandofthedea,Too Dark,3,24 September 2006,"Now the parts I enjoyed with the original Batman, are not in this one. This movie is just too dark. It's no longer a Batman film, it has become a boring crime film with another ""hero"". Micheal Keaton wasn't ever a good Batman and showed it being number 2 to the Joker. Now he's number 3 to Penguin and Catwoman. I do like Catwoman in this movie but I don't understand the Penguin. He's nothing like the comic book Penguin that was clever and suave. Danny Devito shows a just disgusting excuse for a villain. The only thing in this entire movie I like was the Bruce Wayne, Serlina romance. I liked how they were attracted not only as Batman, but as Catwoman as well. Though not even romance can save this train wreck you could call a Batman movie.",Batman Returns

Michelle-CAT WOMAN-Pfeiffer, became the lady of a child's dreams and Danny's work made me realize that in cinema, short and screams works big time, yet, I didn't care a dime for the hero of Gotham city.

420,Quills113,Spectacular!!,10,8 May 2002,"[may contain spiolers]
Batman Returns is the best of the bat franchise...Batman was much darker than this movie and the later two, not directed by Tim Burton, were too cartoony and childish. Michael Keaton returns as the caped crusader Batman, a.k.a. Bruce Wayne. One evening a horrible, disfigured man-bird called the Penguin [Danny Devito] surfaces in Gotham City. He blackmails cold hearted businessman Max Schrek [Christopher Walken] to help reintroduce him into society. Schrek convinces Penguin to run for mayor so that his power plant can dump toxic waste everywhere and get more money from the city. His moussy secretary, Selina Kyle [Michelle Pfeiffer in her best role yet] finds this out and he ''kills'' her. She is revived by several cats and becomes the hero-villain Catwoman. Now Batman must stop Schrek and Penguin, clear his name, and romance Catwoman all at once.This is the best movie in the series...not as dark as the first one or as childish as the last two. The writing is superb and there is only one dissapointment. CATWOMAN HASN'T RETURNED IN ANY OF THE OTHER BAT MOVIES. She is the best villain and she hasn't resurfaced.My favorite part of the movie is the end, when Bruce wayne walks in that ally and finds the black cat...and then it takes us up the rafters of Gotham City's buildings and we see the Bat signal and Catwoman appears in the shadows...she not dead!
this is a great movie and i give it a 10/10..",Batman Returns
421,orient_86,Very good,10,25 June 2005,"I don't know why critics cal it bizarre and macabre. I really don't. Dark -yes, bizarre - no. It i s sad and with lots of emotions, specially with the Pinguin's story. They say it has elements of S&M but I really don't find anything of that sort except for Catwoman's whip.This movie is deeper than its genre and villains aren't just some crazy freaks dressed like on a masquerade. They have strong motives with strong feelings involved. Catwoman (a great performance by Michelle Pfeifer!) isn't just a sexy chick who likes steeling jewels - she's on her personal crusade and Pinguin... well, by the end of the movie you really feel sorry for him (strong performance by Danny DeVito). Again, I think Michael Keaton is the best Batman and he carries his costume well.You can totally see that it is a Tim Burton movie, because he has an unusual style and is a very talented guy. But also the music is fantastic and fits the emotions.",Batman Returns
422,motherfu,"Slower and darker than the original, but Tim Burton is still the master of the comic-book-movie genre.",10,20 September 1998,"There have been four Batman movies, and only the original was a great movie. The sad thing is: Batman is one of the coolest heros ever, and the movies could have all been outstanding. In Batman Returns, the villains triple up to replace the brilliant Jack Nicholson. So we get Catwoman, Penguin, and stock villain Christopher Walken taking Gotham City by storm and never really seeming all that dangerous. Batman shows up, of course, never really seeming all that impressive. Tim Burton is not great at creating action sequences, but he makes up for it with a very cool look for the sets, the costumes, and the film itself. The movie is mildly exciting at best, but it's beginning to look like a classic next to Joel Shumacker's mediocre Batman Forever and ridiculous Batman and Robin.",Batman Returns
423,ivica83,between the lines,10,21 November 2003,"It's a Tim Burton movie, folks! As such, you should know before you even see the opening credits that you will have to read between the lines. Burton is never concerned with stereotypes, he considers them as given. Instead, what he does is - he twists the stereotypes to their most nightmarish extreme. The perfectly incompetent secretary becomes a feminist anti-hero. The child that has been casted away wants to become the mayor by using his sad past. The cold power plant owner is a nice father. The millionaire is not only a superhero, but a superhero who is looking for a soulmate. So, give this movie a couple of chances before you decide about anything. I have seen it three times and I am still discovering new things in the abundance of information that this movie has to over. It is over the top, of course, but you know that Burton uses that approach in order to show something. Keep this in mind and enjoy it.",Batman Returns
424,Kit-48,A close second-best,7,21 March 2000,"This film is where the Batman franchise ought to have stopped. Though I will concede that the ideas behind ""Batman Forever"" were excellent and could have been easily realised by a competent director, as it turned out this was not to be the case.Apparently Warner Brothers executives were disappointed with how dark this second Batman film from Tim Burton turned out. Apart from the idiocy of expecting anything else from Burton, and the conservative cowardice of their subsequent decision to turn the franchise into an homage to the Sixties TV series, I fail to understand how ""Batman Returns"" can be considered at all disappointing.True, it is not quite the equal of the first film - though it repairs all the minor deficiencies of style found in ""Batman,"" a weaker script that splits the antagonism between not just two but three characters invites unflattering comparisons to the masterful pairing of Keaton and Jack Nicholson as the Joker in the first film. Yet for all this it remains a gorgeously dark film, true to the way the Batman was always meant to be, and highly satisfying.Michael Keaton returns as the Batman and his alter ego Bruce Wayne, tangling with nouveau riche tycoon Max Schreck (Christopher Walken, named in honour of the 1920s German silent actor), his partner-in-crime Oswald Cobblepot, the Penguin (Danny DeVito in brilliant makeup reminiscent of Laurence Olivier's ""Richard III""), and Selina Kyle, the Catwoman (Michelle Pfeiffer), whom Wayne romances both as himself and as the Batman. The four principals turn in excellent performances, especially Walken and DeVito, while together Keaton and Pfeiffer explore the darker side of double identities.There are some intriguing concepts in this film. About the only weakness I can really point out is a certain limpness to the script in some places, which I think is due mostly to the way this film is a four-cornered fight. There simply isn't enough time to properly explore what's going on.Nevertheless, this is a damn good film. I highly recommend watching this in conjunction with the first, and then weeping for how good the series could have been had it continued under Burton and Keaton.",Batman Returns
425,Nick Adams_,Possibly the best screen version of a comic ever.,10,28 December 2000,"This pitchblack screen version of the batman figure is simply as perfect as it gets.First of all the winter Gotham in which the movie takes place, is a stunningly beautiful, dark and gothic place, a precise interpretation of the best of the batman graphic novels, and perhaps simply the best scenery that Tim Burton so far has produced (even counting Sleepy Hollow). Second -the story line, often accused of being far to black, to me is pure perfection. Never has the dubiousness of the batman figure been better put to light, and the dark corrupt world in which he lives, is to me the essence of the batman myth. After all we are taking about a man who has dedicated his whole life to the vengeance of something that happened to him as an 8 year old. If people want batman to be light family entertainment, they can go watch the 60`s tv-series (""quick robin get the shark spray""). Third, the acting is sublime, Michael Keaton (normally not a favorit of mine) plays him with an intensity that makes Val Kilmer and George Clooney look like something out of the above mentioned shows. The rest of the cast is equally perfect, what makes the difference from the later films is that this cast actually bothers to act, not just make caricatures.",Batman Returns

The acting was kinda poor, with exception of Pfeiffer's role, which I thought she did a great job with. (I believe she stole the show) The effects leave a lot to be desired. The story was ok, you know vengeful penguin out to destroy his enemies and take over as leader type deal. Yet I am drawn to watch this movie again and still enjoy it. Michelle Pfeiffer's role was not just a sexy catwoman, but a twisted dual personality of a sweet nerdish 'old maid' and the aggressive 'cat' dominatrix that she becomes. She draws the viewer in to sympathize with Selina and despite the fact she wants to do harm to the lead hero, we still root for through out. Maybe thats why I like this film so much.two thumbs up.",Batman Returns

Shot in technicolour monochrome, the array of beautiful characters, sets, and the quirky script give us one of the few commercial blockbusters ever to be made with such a strong arthouse feel. Gothic fairytales don't come any better than this. Shame Tim Burton didn't continue to make Batman movies.  Because I for one don't want to ever have to suffer as much pain as I did watching Batman and Robin.",Batman Returns
429,kagrisier,Missed Opportunities,7,10 September 2006,"First off, this is not a superhero film. It's barely a Batman film. Instead of giving us a straightforward film, Tim Burton sidetracks the film with so many plot twists and story lines, that the whole thing gets bogged down.The script is badly written. In the beginning, we hear about a power plant. About halfway through the film, the whole idea of a power plant disappears. Later on, Penguin has obtained some plans to the Batmobile. They're not even crude drawings, just plans. Where did he get them from? Unfortunately, we'll never know.Then we have the villains. The nose-biting, mucus-spewing, deformed Penguin is executed in possibly the worst way. How did the Penguin find the circus? Just how did he return to Gotham City as a lone child? The entire freakishness of the Penguin just makes you not sympathize with him, as Burton no doubt wanted, but want to tell him to ""take a hike"" and do something that's actually believable. Catwoman isn't so much a disaster, but she is ruined nonetheless. Licking herself, fashioning a whole suit out of a jacket, and becoming a martial arts expert overnight, she also is a sad mock-up of her comic book counterpart.One of the things I like best about Batman is that he rose out of a tragedy and made the best of it. Keaton, while giving us an excellent performance, loses any heroics Batman had about him in the first film, and instead brings us a dark, rarely speaking, killing creature of the night. He brings us the dark knight, but leaves out the caped crusader.The sets are cluttered, dark, and sad. Gotham is supposed to be a creepy place, but not a Gothic place. The city is just a twisted reality, but the film gives us a city-in-a-matchbox. That's how cluttered it is.I can at least say something good about the score. Danny seems to want to try and give us a heroic sense, but is deflated by Burton's ""genious"". Poor guy.However, I still like this film. Why? It gives you such emotion with the portrayal of it's characters, it's hard to forget. Also, buried deep within these villains, you'll find the comic-book characters you know. Their original origins are, whether on purpose or not, mixed in with the movie origins.Overall, it's a good Batman flick, with some missed opportunities. However, there is some good acting and character development found here, that cannot really be explained.",Batman Returns

431,RogerEbertJr,Batman Returns is a great sequel.,10,30 July 2005,"Batman Returns is not the sequel people expected. That could be because director Tim Burton was never too crazy about doing a sequel. In a way it is obvious that he wanted to do something completely different. The film was shot in LA (original in England), Anton Furst's Oscar-Winning sets were replaced by Bo Welch, and the costume has gone through a drastic change. As I write the changes I am also writing the flaws. I prefer Furst's sets, shooting in England, and the original costume. Everything else, however, I think is awesome! Tim Burton is a great artist and I feel like Batman Returns is a great work of art. I am not going to spoil it for you by giving away all the symbolisms. The joy of watching Batman Returns is figuring out everything Burton hid under the surface.RATING: 4 (****) out of (****)For the curious: The plot of the film is that Max Schreck (Christopher Walken) is a corrupt business man who uses the Penguin to recall the mayor.

The part of when Selina becomes; metamorphoses into Catwoman is a bit of a mystery to some people, but if you give it enough thought you'll understand why it looked the way it did. Ozwalt Cobblepott/Penguin is somewhat sympathetic in the beginning of the film when you see how rejected he was by his parents, but sadly is nothing but pure evil through out the film. Max Shreck is a tepid, deceptive, and manipulative fiend who you just wish you can punch the lights out of badly.Michael Keaton's portrayal of Batman/Burce Wayne was flawless and spot on. Michelle Pheiffer's role as Selina Kyle/Catwoman was incredible, luscious, and compelling to watch. Danny Devito as Ozwalt Cobblepott/Penguin is of perfect perfection and VERY raw. Christpher Walken as Max Shreck is believable and reminds of former or current boss you might have who was just as tepid and self centred.

435,ben9909,"Dark Satire, and good sequel to match.",8,12 November 2002,"**Possible Spoilers Ahead**Batman Returns premiered three or so years after the acadamy award winning original (BATMAN 1989), of course, like all or most sequels, it turned out a little on the wrong side of the yard.Batman Returns is an interesting film, because, a lot of reviews compare it to its predecessor, and, i think that it is because of this, that this film got so much negative feedback.Its a new Gotham City, almost crime ridden, apart from a mysterious Penguin man of the sewer (Danny DeVito) and a new crime boss exec, Max Shreck (Christopher Walken). Add to the mix a new on the scene good/bad/in the middle figure, Catwoman (Michelle Phiffier) and, of course, the Dark Knight (played again magnificently by Michael Keaton), and you have a seemlessly hit flick to rival it's original, or, even top it. Or so i thought...Once again, its good to look at visually. But once again, i was a little disappointed that Batman was again used as a support character for the two villains. It once again didnt explore that inner fuel of what makes Batman tick, and the story was a visual disaster, not much for the actors to work with.I cant believe that Daniel Waters wrote this script. What was he thinking. Penguin man who hides in the sewers? Drinks and spits vile, eats raw fish? Bites peoples noses? This character was a little to much Tim Burton, ala Edward Scizzorhands, and not like the comic book counter part, who is smug, posperous and a genuine criminal, Danny DeVito's portrayal was that of a monster, a hybrid.Catwoman, apart from Joker in the original, was actually done correctly, the only villain done correctly in my personal opinion.Overall, Batman Returns is a film on its own. Dark, Mysterious. Not Batman! No, Batman wasnt supposed to be like this. I havent seen it as many times as the original, but i still enjoy viewing it for its originality, but like all sequels, it was a little case of ""too big a budget, too big a flop"". Its a little disapointing, a little sad, and ultimatly, the end of Michael Keaton's reign of being Batman (The best Bat of all?)If you havent already, catch Batman Returns, but remember, its dark, has dark hidden jokes, and isnt the way Batman is supposed to be portrayed. Overall...***OUTOF*****Enjoyable",Batman Returns
436,MrLuthor89,A Dark and Misunderstood Masterpiece,10,24 October 2005,"Who in Hollywood is more misunderstood than Tim Burton? Well, no one. The Batman films over the years have been plagued by one and only one thing...no, not Joel Schumacher...they are called Studio Heads. But enough of that. The fact is, this movie was not advertised, nor made to be a fan friendly or even kid friendly movie. After the success of ""Batman"", a sequel was inevitable. In order to lure Burton back into directing, the ""Powers that Be"" told Burton that it could be an ""all Burton film"". This is very rare for a director to get in these money grabbing days. With all the politics and misunderstandings of the finished product aside, the film ""Batman Returns"" provides a dark, intense, and very exciting interpretation of ""Batman"" on screen. ""Returns"" shows us three characters, which all have dual identities. One is a creature of the night, stopping ruthless and petty criminals in every alley way and rooftop, and is also a tortured billionaire industrialist with the guilt of is parents death haunting him. There is also a purrr-fect enemy, draped in skin tight vinyl and carries a whip, with vengeance on the mind, and was once a push over secretary who was obviously pushed over one too many times. Finally there is the Penguin, a freakish and vile figure who was abandoned by his parents and now wishes for the respect that has avoided him all his life, and as Oswald Cobblepot, he gains the respect of the city in order to become its mayor. With these three characters, all you can get is an epic Tim Burton masterpiece, and that is what it became.After discovering their first born as a freakishly deformed monster, the Cobblepots decide to rid themselves of this black sheep. Almost thirty years later, the lost Cobblepot son has become the Penguin man in the sewer, who has become just as much a myth in Gotham City as the legend of Big Foot. After the Tree lighting ceremony in Gotham only weeks before Christmas, all hell breaks loose. Within one night, the evil industrialist Max Schrek (Christopher Walken) is kidnapped by the Penguin (Danny DeVito), and blackmailed into helping him re-emerge into Gotham society to finally earn the respect that he so thirsts after. Following this, Shreck drops his nobody assistant, Selina Kyle (Michelle Pfeiffer), out of his department store window after she discovers his Power Plant operation is just a scheme to suck what's left of power out of the city. Little does Shreck know, this nobody assistant survived, and is going to turn the tables on him ten fold as Catwoman, donning the skin tight vinyl black outfit and cracking a dangerously long whip. As Shreck helps the Penguin become Gotham's new golden boy, Oswald Cobblepot, he also uses Oswald to challenge the Mayor (Michael Murphy) into a recall election. If this happens, Shrek's Power Plant is secured. Now it is up to Batman (Michael Keaton) to stop these three super-villains from carrying out there plans. It is just a question now to whether Bruce will be able to balance his love for Selina and his duty as Batman to bring her, Oswald, and Shreck to justice.The movie's performances, special effects, costumes, amazing sets, and of course make-up design make this movie great. Michael Keaton returns (Forgive the pun) as the dark knight. Keaton gave us a dark complexity to the tortured soul of Bruce Wayne in Batman 1, and he carries that into this film, but in a much different way. His complexity in this film has more to do with his lack of a real life. In the first time we see him in the movie, he is sitting down in his study, doing absolutely nothing, until the Bat signal shines through his home, in which he then, through his eyes and body movement, comes to life. Through his attraction to Selina, he is naturally hoping for he and his equal to possibly have more of a ""happy ending"" to their story. Michelle Pfeiffer is actually, in my opinion, more unrecognizable than Danny DeVito. I say this only because in the beginning, we are introduced to this bumbling and oblivious secretary, and then she becomes a determined, sexy, and very aggressive creature of the night. Pfeiffer's brilliance in her dual roles, her body language, her change in voice, and overall sex appeal make this Catwoman probably the best ever seen projected from the comic book legend. The scene where Bruce and Selina are the only ones not wearing costumes at the costume ball, with the haunting song ""Face to Face"" echoing in the background, is truly brilliant. Now for Danny DeVito. This is probably my absolute favorite Danny DeVito performance. While his make-up says enough, its DeVito chewing through the make-up, the scenery, and most of the other actors to get his portrayal of the tortured, deformed, vile, and ingenious villain that is the Penguin, off. In many ways, he can make you feel sorry for him, and in other ways, he can make you loathe and detest his very existence. A true comic-book/movie villain through and through. Finally for the great Christopher Walken. Walken was cast as a character that does not appear in the Batman comic-book universe. He is described as a rich, handsome, but diabolical businessman, who will suck the life out of anything he touches (much like a vampire, in which the actor Max Schreck in real life portrayed the vampire in the famous film ""Nosferatu""). Shreck in many ways is the personification of Gotham City, as he says ""I' am the light of this city. And I' am its mean, twisted soul."" Walken, in a sense, is more horrific than the Penguin. Shreck on the outside is a wealthy and respectable man, while on the inside, is more a horrific beast than the Penguin could ever be. An amazing and operatic Tim Burton masterpiece all the way though.8/10",Batman Returns
437,Mattster99,An absolute thrill-fest from beginning to end!,8,3 April 2010,"Tim Burton went for a much more darker, creepier and serious approach to the ""Batman"" series and what we got was an absolute blockbuster!. He did a superb job with ""Batman"", and now he has done an even better job with this amazing sequel.In the prologue a wealthy couple have a deformed baby, and because they can't handle it they throw the baby in to the lake nearby, some years later... Crimes have been occurring around Gotham City, involving a group of Circus Freaks, than the city calls Batman (Michael Keaton) to stop the ongoing and escalating crimes. A local businessmen named Max Shreck (Christopher Walken) forms an alliance with the leader of the Circus Freaks, a man named Oswald Cobblepot (Danny Devito), who is a deformed man just trying to fit in to the real world, and Max tries to help him by making them colleagues, but when Max's assistant Selina Kyle (Michelle Pfeiffer) discovers he's a evil businessmen she tries to leave the building but Max catches her, and shoves her out of the nearby window, she later becomes Catwomen, and wants revenge on Max for what he did, Batman is framed for things and is now believed to be just another evil villain, and than Batman tries to take down the the evil team...All the actors do a perfect job in their roles, Michael Keaton is always great and will always be my favorite ""Batman"" of the whole series and Michelle Pfeiffer as Catwoman was a perfect choice by Tim Burton, Danny Devito plays his part well, he really pulled it off,it is really over-acting at it's finest, Christopher Walken was great as the slimy evil businessmen Max Shreck, which his name is a reference to the first 'Dracula' movie, 'Nosferatu', because the actor that played the vampire was named 'Max Shreck'.The atmosphere of the film was perfect, dark, gloomy, perfect for a ""Batman"" film, the script must have been written really well, because the film always keeps you interested and it never drags or becomes corny it just stays as Tim Burton Wanted it.This film it for any good action lover, it's not to be taken very seriously, hardcore ""Batman"" fans will not be disappointed, so if you haven't seen it, go rent it, buy it, it's an absolute blockbuster.",Batman Returns
438,marcigabrielle,The Darkest Masterpiece,10,19 June 2006,"Let's be clear from the start: I don't see ""Batman Returns"" as a Batman movie at all. I see it as a pure artistic expression on its own, a very personal projection from one of the most gifted directors in Hollywood.We're all fed the optimistic line that ""we all have the power to be happy,"" but the world around us is still consumed in agonizing suffering. The best we can do is ignore such suffering, and try to think that the optimistic view does apply, even when in reality it only applies to some of us.This movie shatters such idea. The world is not a perfect place, and not even one where everybody can make do and learn to live with what they are given. The three main characters here are deeply wounded people, who cannot integrate to society and be happy like everybody else _even if they tried_.Batman is split because of the traumatic death of his parents. He enjoys the privileges of a rich man, has respectability through his Bruce Wayne mask, and somehow such respectability translates into a respectable pursuit: punishing evil, taking the side of good, becoming part of what makes society good, even if he has to remain hidden.In the case of Catwoman the trauma is deeper. She, as a secretary who is not given any respect for her idea and as someone who comes from a small town into the big city, is a marginal. Unlike Bruce Wayne, she has no fortune, her life is not at the center of ""normalcy,"" and she finds herself abandoned--by her boyfriend, by her family, by the executives. In one very poignant scene, she is left to clean the table after the all-male executives leave.The imagery of abandonment continues (the calls from her mother reflect a difficult relationship, with little affection and much control; her boyfriend doesn't even have the spine to tell her directly he is leaving on his own). Abandonment plus marginality equal failure. Catwoman, even in her mousy avatar at the start of the movie, is a raging volcano. She makes that much clear in the final scene: she has gone beyond the level of rage that allows a person to try to adapt to normal society (""I just couldn't live with myself, so don't pretend this is a happy ending!""), and what is left for her is to be more radical than Batman: she will fight against the evil doers, but she won't take sides with the nice-and-proper. That makes her special and, in some ways, greater than Batman. She doesn't try to pass revenge as justice, no: she acknowledges it is revenge, and does not repent.The Penguin is by far the most disturbing character and the reason why many people hated this movie. What happens when you're born in such a way that there is no chance whatsoever to be ""normal""? Unlike Catwoman or Batman, for the Penguin there is not the choice of pretending to be like other people--he is, evidently, too different.""You're just jealous because I'm a genuine freak and you have to wear a mask,"" that marks the Penguin's reality. What could an intelligent (the Penguin's level of speech is amazingly elevated for someone who grew up in the sewers and as a freak in a circus, and attests to his intelligence) person for whom all possibilities of social integration are denied do? For the Penguin, society is the enemy. In truth, he has little (or no) choice.As Batman is the vigilante and Catwoman the avenger, the Penguin is the terrorist. He symbolizes the plight of those people who, for a reason or another (physical differences, religion, race, politics, language) are deemed ""absolute marginals"" in many parts of the world. And, as the terrorist doesn't blow himself or herself up for nothing, but because from his/her point of view there is nothing left but to kill and die, because for them life is hell and the hurt is so great the only way to pay it back somehow is by his/her own destruction and the destruction of those inflicting the pain, the Penguin has deep motives and, in spite of his hideousness and evil intentions, it is very difficult not to feel sad for him.That is a feeling most people would rather not have. We're much more comfortable thinking in terms of good and bad, so that we can put ourselves cleanly in the camp of goodness. Yet, here we have a deformed man who orders to kidnap children to kill them (""No! It's a lot!"") and who plans to blow up a whole city, yet we cannot fail to somehow understand his motivations and feel sad at his death.That feeling makes us, who live comfortably in our little worlds isolated from the brutality of the lives of most people in this planet, feel bad. But that is Burton's master blow, too. Because in that moment when we understand a little, when we feel a little sorry for such an individual, we almost grasp what is behind so much of the pain and suffering in the world. Because the world is not black-and-white, it's much less comfortable than that.The imagery of abandonment is much more present with the Penguin: from the moment when he's dumped in the river to the last moment when all his circus minions leave. Catwoman rejects normalcy by rejecting the possibility of a life with Batman; the Penguin embraces marginality (""I am NOT a human being, I am an animal!"") to the last, expected conclusion.In fact, this movie is a psychosocial study on marginality and abandonment, and the violence they generate. This is a subversive movie, because it makes us think beyond the terms of bad vs. good, and makes us realize how, in the grand scheme of things, we cannot judge others unless we have lived in their shoes.",Batman Returns

441,charlessmith702210-205-685220,Probably the best of the Batman feature movies ever,10,3 February 2021,"Well, the whole story behind this ""Batman"" movie sequel--would be the Danny Elfman story. This film composer's movie soundtrack to ""Batman Returns"" was probably one of the best ones I had seen in any other movie since ""Star Wars"" of John Williams. The way Elfman treats the film is almost like a clinic on how to create musical leading motives for the protagonist--Batman, and the two antagonists--the Penguin and Catwoman. Batman's musical theme is powerful and angular--the Penguin has stepwise notes that depicts his walking gait with his webbed black feet, and Cat's theme focuses on a four-note series of 2 minor seconds that depict her stalking walks, scratching and meow sounds.This Batman movie takes place in two major spaces - Gotham City on the edge of Christmas time, where an entrepreneur/corporate juggernaut, Max Shreck, runs his own business and department store in that downtown area, and the Penguin's lair, which has two substrates - an on-earth area of snow-packed zoo animals seemed to be stuffed, called ""Big Zoo"", and the zoo's attachment-attraction, ""Arctic World"", which leads to the subterranean lagoon where The Penguin lies.The main beginning of ""Batman Returns"" is the Christmas tree-lighting ceremony at Gotham, featuring the Ice Princess who switches on the lights, which goes well. But then, Penguin's evil circus army crashes the ceremony in an all-out attack on its citizens, but Batman steps in to stop the carnage.When the Penguin reveals itself, after luring Max Shreck into an underground trap and is forced to meet up with that villain in his lair, Penguin reveals some of his special ""umbrella"" dual-use weapons to him, such as a Twilight Zone umbrella that fires rifle shots, or another umbrella that is a flamethrower, and then another one that displays a long knife. Penguin also explains to Max about one part of the lagoon that has hazardous waste--called toxic effluent--from the textile plant that he owns, but Max retorts that he shreds the negative pollution evidence from his company from prying eyes. Eventually, the Penguin wants in to get out from being imprisoned from years in the sewer, and Max gives in to helping him out of it with his own celebration. When the Penguin does reveal himself in that first media celebration aboveground, he reveals that he wants to delve deep into the city's vital records to learn not only his family--but also what was his real name. The Gothamites do allow him access to the records and after that, the Penguin reveals that he did not want to be that anymore - he is actually Oswald Cobblepot, his real self. He tells the crowd that when he was raised as a son, his parents (Tucker and Esther, the parents who sent him into the lair at the movie's overture, who were now dead) mistreated him badly, but now, he pardons them publicly. Then, he decides to become mayor of Gotham City, and Max Shreck decides to be his DIY publicist for his campaign run.In between, there was Selina Kyle, who works for Shreck as probably her secretary. In one scene, Max Shreck catches her inadvertent reading of his confidential files, and then is stealthily forced into an outdoor window, and when he kisses Selina, it is forced and this causes Selina to crash through the window and falls to her death hundreds of feet below. Eventually, she is resurrected as a flurry of cats bite on what was Selina's corpse and as soon as she gets a second life, she goes to her home and her behavior has greatly changed, leading to the formation of Selina's alias--Catwoman, or Cat.Meanwhile, Oswald Cobblepot orders his evil circus army to bring destruction to Gotham's downtown, with additional work by Cat, as part of his run, who, with Oswald's help, thwart Batman's ending of the second evil circus carnage with an unsuspecting romance. Later on, Oswald wants the re-lighting of the Christmas tree and wants Batman to keep order, and preceding that, Batman and Selina start a romance at Wayne's home, which had to stop for some reason and word came out that the Ice Princess was abducted.While all that is going on, Oswald orders his evil cohorts to change the Batmobile's intricacies after Batman goes to save the Princess, but Cat frustrates Batman's efforts, and as Batman tries to save her who was fettered with ropes on a pedestal ledge a few hundred feet up, Oswald throws a ""lawn dart"" of bats that attack the Princess and forced her to fall way, way down straight to her death, but not until putting on that tree light switch on her fatal impact to the ground, which in turn causes a large swarm of bats to hover around the audience. The Cat is then congratulated by Penguin, but then, when Cat refuses Penguin's new evil proposal, Penguin rejects the Cat forever, making her fly away in his own umbrella helicopter. The Cat does release herself and falls into a greenhouse, and then screams out - fortunately that is the 3rd life she saved herself. Then Oswald goes to try to manipulate the Batmobile's controls as Batman drives through downtown in a wild way, but Batman was able to detect the foreign object after doing great damage, and escapes. Then, as Oswald makes his public outdoor speech, Batman and Wayne jam the frequency of the speech, and the crowd boos, marking the end of Oswald's mayoral campaign. In anger, Oswald fires shots with his umbrella and goes back into the lair in a Duck Car. Finally, in anger, he says Oswald is no more and he wants to be the evil Penguin again. He plans a destruction of all of the first-born sons of Gotham as revenge for the destruction of his mayoral campaign, by bringing them to their death in their toxic effluent area of the lagoon.Meanwhile, Shreck holds an executive masquerade party, with Max and his friend, Chip Shreck, attending. Batman (Bruce Wayne in disguise) and Selina Kyle also attend the party later and embrace in a slow dance, but Penguin crashes the party in a big explosion, warns the partyers that the first-born sons will be doomed, and demands Chip Shreck to send him to death in the sewer - but Max decides he is the one who deserves to die, because he helped Penguin. The Penguin gives in and forces Max to the Duck Car, and off to the Penguin's lair they go. The Penguin then restrains Shreck in a locked bird cage above the water that is not toxic.As the evil circus army train-car rolls in to take some of the first-born sons to the deadly lair, Batman intervenes and snatches away the main train-car driver. A message by Penguin's pet monkey about the first deadly plan being frustrated angers the Penguin ten-fold.Now, with a larger Penguin army with missiles on their backs, the Penguin now is waging war on all of Gotham's people, wanting all of them dead. As the army encroaches in on Gotham Plaza to fire its missiles, Batman and the old man in the Wayne's home jam the frequency and forces the penguins to turn away from the plaza back to their lair, making the Penguin nervous. Then, they hear the Batmobile coming in, and even Penguin's daring escape in his Duck Car was not good enough, and the Batmobile crashes into the Duck Car, knocking that car out for good. Their last short combat ends with Batman revealing a buzzing homing beacon, which then reveals the penguins with all of their missiles around the Big Zoo. The Penguin presses the red beacon button thinking it will lure them, but instead, this fires the missiles that eventually destroy the Big Zoo, and at the same time, the Batmobile releases a series of bats that attack the Penguin and then, he crashes through a window and way down to the toxic sludge water below.Batman realizes the Big Zoo is going to be destroyed and escapes through a zip line down into the Penguin's Lair itself, but before that, just as Max was about to escape from the cage with the monkey's help, his leg is snatched by a rope and he goes down hard into the water - it is the Cat trying to stop him. After the zip line, Batman stops Cat, now armed with a whip, but not before Cat slams Max under a high voltage capacitor in the lair's electrical substation area. At that point, the missiles do the final job of completely destroying Big Zoo.Then, Batman tries to make Selina reconcile herself and recognize that Batman is actually Bruce Wayne and they have the same dark sides. Batman unmasks himself to prove a point, and Selina realizes that he is for real. Then as Batman was about to kiss him, Cat scratches him and says she does not want to have a relationship with him anymore, and Max reveals that because of her cat behavior that was unacceptable to him, Max fires her. Then Max shoots Batman with one shot, and then, Max shoots 4 shots at the Cat, trying to put an end to the Cat nightmare, but as Cat approaches very close to him, with both under the capacitor, Max runs out of bullets.This leads to the last chapter. Cat wants out of Max for good, so she makes a kiss on Max with her activated stun gun, which then goes up to the electrical capacitor, and as she kisses Max, Max gets electrically fried, and the whole substation and capacitors - get energized with a grand finale of arcing and sparks and explosions. After the explosions are done, Batman, surviving the bullet wound, goes into the electrical damage and finds Max burned hard to a crisp. Meanwhile, the Penguin emerges from the toxic water, now more slimy and greenish blue from the toxic effects, and as he gets up on land, he does one last ditch attack at Batman with his last umbrella weapon, which turns out only to be an innocent carousel, and eventually, the Penguin falls near Batman's feet for the last time, and perishes there. The Emperor penguins do a funeral memorial, taking the dead Penguin down to the non-toxic area of the water, letting him sink there for eternity, and Batman can only watch helpless.",Batman Returns

There are no winners here. Even in victory, there is loss.Whereas other comic book films—X-Men, Fantastic Four, Spider-man—have taken the explosive, CGI, Jerry Bruckheimer route, Batman Returns is subtle, grounded, and real. Batman is a human consumed by the desire for justice. He has no super-human abilities far beyond those of mortal men. Batman's arsenal is made up of exceptional observation skills, a sharp intellect, finely honed physical skills, and the innate ability to emotionally detach from a stressful situation. Burton exploits this humanity as the foundation upon which the film is built.The true power of Batman Returns is found in the character relationshipsBefore Christopher Nolan's Batman Begins, Batman Returns was the crown jewel in this hero's filmatic crown.

444,spacefoo,An epic movie...beyond a superhero movie,8,14 May 2007,"This is an epic from start to finish. This movie reminds me of an operatic score, its dramatic and triumphant. It takes the simplicity of the original and adds lairs and depths to the characters- to take it beyond a superhero movie of bad versus evil which works for and against it. It explores dark sides, dripping with sexuality and black humour. This is possibly Michelle Pfeiffers finest role bar possibly Dangerous Minds-she turns from do-good nervous secretary to a sexy mysterious and nasty'cat woman.' Danny DeVito was perfect as the penguin- he had terrific lines in the blackest humour. Michael Keaton i maintain is the finest 'Batman;' and what is possibly one of the only downfalls of this movie is that again batman takes a backstep to the development of these bad guys stories. Thats why its beyond the superhero movie maybe some Batman die-hards were hoping for, as we see little of batman outside of when he first tackles the circus gang, in a tremendous set piece, full of action and gadgetry we see mostly character development of his foes. That said the scenes with Keaton and his interaction and chemistry with Michelle Pfeiffer's character was nothing short of sizzling, Keaton will probably go down as one of the most-underrated actors of all time, and again was terrific in this movie. Who else sizzled? the fantastic Christopher Walken-as the corrupt business man working to make the Penguin the mayor of Gotham. Tim Burton creates a Gotham ice world, absolutely awe-inspiring, the army of penguins in the end armed, is so dark and twisted it can only come out of the mind of Burton. Oh and the bat-mobile and Batmans new improved utility belt plus the arrival of the Batsub at the end. Its just so darn cool!Beside the original in my opinion there is no need to watch 'begins' or the poor Schumacher sequels because the real genius lies with Burton and Keaton and the co-stars, and the amazingly dark world that is created. Returns has its flaws maybe to the extent it tries to be too huge scale and there is possibly too much going on, but Burton wanted to really put his fantastical might in to this movie and i think thats where it struggles to match the original due to the fact its more of a Burton fantasy spectacle than a pure Batman movie, this is still a twisted epic and a must see, however clear Burton doesn't trust the original Bob Kane Batman story.",Batman Returns
445,Python504,Batman Returns (1992),5,23 September 2006,"Tim Burton's 'Batman Returns' (1992) caused much controversy from parents over its dark tone. Can one stay that Burton went a little over-broad in trying to create a darker version of Batman. Yes.The film is about Batman (Michael Keaton) must battle the Penguin (Danny DeVito), Catwoman (Michelle Phieffer), and businessman Max Shreck (Christopher Walken).I don't understand it. How can Tim Burton make two Batman movies that destroy Bob Kane's vision, yet fans love them, while the hate Shumachur's vision, which was true to Kane's (Not counting B&R, of course).Now when one first sees the film, they'll think it story with a nice social commentary on the world we love. This commentary is quite nice, like how people like Penguin, who just want respect and love, are treated like freaks, while people like Max Shreck, who are heartless and cold individuals, are respected by everyone.But by the end of the day, Superhero films are meant to entertain, with nice action sequences, along with nice human subplots.

446,kaessner,Tim Burton at his finest.,9,4 August 2002,"It is easily debatable to determine which of Burton's films reigns as his best. The only other movie which comes close to this caliber of filmmaking it the dark comedy Edward Scissorhands. But Batman Returns is the best movie I have ever seen which utilizes a dark comic atmosphere as the backdrop for a superhero setting. Where it exceeds the greatness of the original Batman is clearly the art direction. The winter season adds to the looming darkness of this film, which is simply fantastic. It also employs four of the perfect actors to carry out these twisted characters. Danny DeVito shines as the vile Penguin, and Chris Walken is beautiful as the manipulative business man. Of course, no one can undermine the fact that Michael Keaton was the best Batman ever, especially in this work. There are also so many perfect shots in this movie, on behalf of our fine director. The most memorable, in my mind, is when the Penguin emerges from the water before his death, the blood dripping from his face. It is just a clear and shocking shot. Along with the most impressive Danny Elfman score ever, this is the perfect Tim Burton feature ever. No matter how many times I watch it, I am in awe of this brutally honest and dark film.

I liked the first one but this one is worse and I will explain why. The script is much worse than the first with some ridiculous dialogue and also ridiculous characters. The penguin is a villain who does not think and in fact for much of the film he is manipulated by Max, who seems the real villain. Catwoman, despite the fact that Michelle Pfeiffer does it very well, is a character that is left in the film. Batman barely fights.
The photography is amazing and so is the makeup. The character of Max seemed to me the most interesting. Despite the fact that it has more mistakes than hits, the film is very entertaining.

448,TomAyles,"Despite the controversies, this is the best live-action Batman movie.",8,26 April 2001,"Batman Returns was attacked by sponsors and parents for being ""too dark"". Indeed, it is the most grotesque and ""adult"" of the live action Batman movies.  But, with the single exception of the short-lived Batman tv series, Batman has always been at his most popular when he has been portrayed as a dark avenger of the night.  During his first year, as the cover hero on National Periodical's Detective Comics (from which DC Comics eventually took its name), he carried a gun and showed little compassion for villains, some of whom he would throw off of roofs.  His background, with his parents being murdered in front of his eyes while a child; his single-minded obsession with avenging their death through a war on crime; and his environment (have you seen the whackos that populate Gotham's underworld?) lend themselves to film noir detective stories, and that's exactly what Batman Returns is.Another complaint is the ""mucking"" with the Batman legend by changing the origins of both Catwoman and The Penguin.  But, as I said in my review of the first Tim Burton Batman movie, even the comic books change various portions of the Batman legend every five to ten years.  No one who is a true Batman fan can ever take seriously complaints that a given interpretation ""changes"" the Batman legend, because it has been changed so many times that there is no ""official"" version.  Batman is a heroic archetype which has been interpreted in incredibly different ways by the various creators who have worked with him.If your favorite Batman is the television show of the 1960's or the comics of the 1950's, then you almost certainly won't like this movie.  But, if you prefer the original Bob Kane Batman from 1939, Denny O'Neil's Batman of the early 1970's, or Frank Miller's Batman writings in the 1980's, then you will love it.",Batman Returns
449,tdkrbatmanfan,Can't believe I thought this was the worst one,8,11 July 2011,"My buddy and I always loved Batman. We used to rent the animated series all the time. He owned the first one and I owned the second one. We loved all four but this one not so much. I watched it four nights ago and it was fantastic. I was blown away by how good it was. The Penguin is played very well by Danny DeVito, Catwoman/Selina Kyle was played to perfection, and Anne Hathaway will not top it.The plot is better than the original, because it is a better idea. The penguin wants to get into the world and meet his parents. He chooses the wrong person to get him into it, Max Schreck. Schreck creates a corrupt version of the Penguin.Christopher Walken played Max Schreck to perfection, but his son was an annoying little prick. And the carnival gang always creeped me out, and still does.Overall, not as good as the original, as it is less entertaining, but more thought out. This one is the last one before the murder of the series.",Batman Returns
450,sarakitty05,"Merry Christmas to all, and to all a good Batman movie",8,30 July 2012,"Obviously, the tone of the movie makes it one that is good (albeit a bit dark) to watch around the holidays. This is the time of year for the second Batman film, although I don't think the holiday cheer is spread around to all. However, I felt cheerful, even though it is July, because this movie was just as good as the first one.Michael Keaton is back as Batman and although at first I wasn't sure what I felt about the guy. But honestly, he is quite charming, quite attractive and quite likable as Batman. He can woo on a dime, his subtle humour can be found with many funny lines, and his Batman is a quiet, not-talkative, brooding type of Batman. He does it really well.Also, no matter who plays Batman, he will always remain the hottest superhero to grace the screen.The other memorable roles include Michelle Pfeiffer, who played Catwoman as such a vixen, and although she was on the wrong side, you couldn't help but like not only her but her relationship with Bruce/Batman (and/or Keaton). Their chemistry was undeniable. It's unfortunate we don't see it play out (Since Catwoman is not in the next one). Danny Devito played an awesome although largely grotesque (did you see his outfit? yarg) Penguin, and the makeup used to turn him unrecognizable was very well done (seeing as there was no reliance on special effects and whatnot). Finally, Christopher Walken also played his role well seeing as it varied incredibly from his usual nutty roles in other films. Well done.A great film, whether watched at Christmastime or not!",Batman Returns
451,stuart_mcmillen,"Good acting, bad plot",5,14 July 2005,"Following the success of 1989's 'Batman', Tim Burton and Michael Keaton released a second movie in the franchise: Batman Returns. Gotham City retains the Gothic look of the first film, only this time the city is in the midst of an icy winter punctuated by the arrival of two new villains on the scene: Catwoman and the Penguin.As a kid I loved this movie and the original Tim Burton 'Batman' movie, however after re-watching it over a decade later it doesn't quite hold up as well as I wished it would have. Part of this reason is the fact that Batman seems almost external to this plot which revolves around Penguin (Danny DeVito), Catwoman (Michelle Pfeiffer) and Gotham businessman Max Shreck (Christopher Walken). Batman (Michael Keaton) seems to only step in momentarily to throw a few punches before exiting back to Wayne Manor.All four lead actors, especially Danny DeVito, deliver great performances in this movie, but it is a real shame that the scriptwriters chose to not continue the analysis into the Bruce Wayne/Batman psyche. Instead, we are left with a fairly routine 'bad guy trying to overthrow the city' story; the Penguin character was well developed, but the action scenes in the movie are nothing memorable. Another complaint is the lack of resolution that is given to the Penguin's attempts to turn Gotham city against Batman. Surely the mislead public would be angry at Batman for the crimes that they believe him to have committed, however the Bat-signal at the end of the film gives the impression that this is not the case.On the positive side though, the movie has a great feel to it; from the visual appearance of the winter Gotham, through to Danny Elfman's musical score. You can't help but feel some of the special effects - computer and real-life - are a little outdated 13 years down the track though.Overall, this childhood favourite of mine is worth a look and a film that I will revisit in the future, but upon reflection should have been better. I'm glad that the newly released 'Batman Begins' dives head first into the exploration of the Bruce Wayne/Batman characters that this film avoids.2.5 stars / 5",Batman Returns

I love all their scenes. And Danny DeVito as The Penguin? Superb!. I know this movie has a good rating, it's just not good enough! The rating should be 10/10.

453,Century_hades,Has grown on me over time.,6,12 January 2017,"Spoiler warning ahead if you have not seen this movie.I originally saw this movie when it was in theatres back in 1992. I was super hyped for this movie, but was looking forward to seeing it. At this point in time my interest in Batman had diminished in favour of Silver Surfer.I did not like this movie at all upon my first time viewing it in a theatre. I thought it was boring, and not anywhere near as good as the first one. I was pretty disappointed with this film compared to the original.The first thing that took me out of this film was that it was set in winter during Christmas. Which threw me off, because it was a summer release. Also I did not like the penguin, and thought the design was just gross. It annoyed me that he was always spitting up blue crap in the film.Also the rocket launching penguins I thought were completely lame.The only thing I liked about the movie upon watching it originally was Catwoman. I thought the character, and the way she was designed looked really cool.Now I've seen the movie many times over the years since then. My views on the film have changed. I actually enjoy it, and I'm entertained by the movie now. It has evolved into one of my favourite movies to throw on at Christmas.I really enjoy the design of the winter setting, and the look of Gotham. It has a other worldly fantasy look to it, and that gives it a timeless feel.I really enjoy the score of the film, and I think Danny Elfman has done a great job on this film.I still don't like the penguin however, and him spitting up blue goo at through out the film still totally annoys me. Also the rocket launching penguins still just makes me shake my head.Catwoman is still awesome, and Michelle Pfeiffer is still my favourite on screen version of Catwoman.If your a die hard Batman fan you've most likely have already seen this movie. If your not, and you're going to watch this film. Keep in my Tim Burton strays quite far with the source material. So there are a lot of changes from the comics. Also this movie is not a perfect film, and has it's flaws. Keeping all that in mind it can be a fun viewing.",Batman Returns
454,MAJORIC,Icky DeVito's performance.,1,5 December 2005,"As a writer, I'm more sensitive than the Regular Joe to plot devices and character motivations. While Nicholson offered us a top notch performance as the Joker in Batman, neither DeVito nor Pfeiffer provide enough strength or motivation to become the so called villains of this motion picture. I went to the theater with high expectations (I even rented Batman to get back high on the subject) and came out utterly disappointed. Even a Luke warm homage to Burguess Meredith would have been a better sequel to the first Batman.Imagine this: DeVito could have played a millionaire eccentric bird lover whose fortune had been taken away, (obviously a rip off plot from Trading Places) but it would lend the character some more power. Then he attacks the city with his army of penguins. Lovable!",Batman Returns
455,GDC,The Dark Knight at his darkest,8,12 December 1999,"In a bare squeaker decision over its predescessor, this one gets my vote as the best of the Batman movies. This is the Batman mythos as it should always be: a dark, twisted world populated by deeply damaged people.  Batman has never been a typical superhero, and this is no typical superhero movie.Yes, it has its share of action and mayhem, but the central pillar holding it all up is the interaction of profoundly disturbed people in bizarre outfits, and the question of what really makes Batman any different from the villains he thwarts.The Penguin, a villain I've never really cared for, is given a great new background here; a tragic, twisted, past worthy of the hero himself. DeVito comes off very well in the role I was convinced Burgess Meredith would own forever.  The Catwoman has also been rethought with a strangely ambiguous origin and an unexpected feminist theme.  I was originally convinced that Pfeiffer was wrong for this part; I should have learned to shut up after the Michael Keaton contraversy.Special mention should go to Bo Welch's production design, which bounces back and forth between skewed circus-from-hell to Speer-like Aryan designs with out-of-control proportions.  While very different from Anton Furst's designs of the first film, it complements the story perfectly. Another special mention to Danny Elfman's score, still one of his best.From its stunning wordless opening sequence to its actionless melancholy ending, this is the thinking person's superhero film.",Batman Returns
456,mpact75,The Dark Knight Returns,10,19 June 2002,"Out of all the Bat-films, Batman Returns is my favorite.  This beautiful, dark, and funny film is one of Tim Burton's best work. Although it is much violent and darker, this is the Batman that creator Bob Kane envisioned many years ago.  Michael Keaton reprises his role as the avenger of Gotham City. This time he's up against two deadly foes, Danny Devito's Penguin and Michelle Pfeiffer's Catwoman.  With a great cast and film score by Danny Elfman, the movie takes us on an adventure as Batman battles the evil forces that are trying to take over Gotham City.  Christopher Walken makes a great appearance as Max Shrek, a shrewd businessman who has an evil scheme up his sleeve.  But of course, Michelle Pfeiffer is the one that steals the show. With all of these components, you have a film that will blow you away. This is the reason why you go to the movies.  It's got everything.  It's really a shame that Tim Burton didn't get to direct the other sequels.  If so I think the franchise would still be going strong today.  Batman Returns is an awesome experience for fans that like cool movies.",Batman Returns
457,trappjl,Arguably the best Batman,9,20 June 2002,"I liked Penguin before I saw the movie.  I loved penguin after I saw the movie.  He has one of the best make-up jobs ever, although it's a little hard to swallow at first.  I only wish he was a more dangerous bad guy who didn't have a circus act to serve as his peons.  Keaton is the best Batman and Pfeiffer is a sexy beast.  The soundtrack rocks and some of the dialogue really sticks.  The plot has its weak points though and the whole story is silly.",Batman Returns
458,blackbrown,"There are many good IMDb reviews for this, but I just don't get it. Awful!",1,29 August 2008,"Well, Danny Devito and Chris Walken are fun to watch but I can't think of another thing to say remotely complementary about this movie. Just dreadful. First off, there's tons of reviews on here praising this movie for being so dark. I don't get this at all. This is an updated version of the TV show in my opinion, all that awful ""camp"" is back. I've also noticed that most of the good reviews are from admitted Tim Burton lovers, something I make no claim to be. ""Batman & Robin"" is constantly maligned for being the downfall of this franchise (before Chris Nolan got his hands on it, of course), but this movie is just as bad as that one. I don't know, Burton's first Batman along with the two Nolan episodes are wonderful, but the other three (""Returns,"" ""Forever,"" and ""Robin"") are just a waste of time. Maybe a 13 year old boy will fall for this crap, but the only adult fans I can imagine enjoying this film are those who will buy anything Burton does simply because it's Burton.",Batman Returns
459,tmlb-06713,So Bad It's Almost Good,5,18 October 2020,"Batman Returns isn't Burton's best film, yet it isn't his worst either.Although there are some dangling plot threads and not much narrative sense, Danny Devito really does make The Penguin come to life. I would say that this is a good movie to watch if you want some big actors starring in a superhero movie that's so bad it's almost good.",Batman Returns
460,sean-1225,"If you thought The Dark Knight was dark, you have not seen anything...",7,29 May 2009,"Batman Returns is the sequel to the 1989 film Batman, and both of them star Michael Keaton and are both directed by Tim Burton. As I explain in the summary that The Dark Knight is very dark and violent, you have not seen a true violent Batman movie until you watch this one. The story for the movie is pretty confusing, and from what I remember, the movie takes place after Batman's encounter with The Joker, until the Penguin is terrorising Gotham city. There is also another villain who is with Penguin, and Batman's girlfriend dies and becomes Catwoman. This can get confusing to remember all the villains after watching the movie as there are three different ones, all with their own story. I don't want to spoil much of the movie, but I must tell you there are some violent parts, especially the beginning which you will know all about if you watch the film. McDonalds made some toys for the movie to release in happy meals, but it was so violent that children will want to go see it and it would cause a bad influence on them. The movie has you glued to your seat, trying not to go get a drink or go to the toilet, because some of the action scenes are the best in any super hero movie. The Penguin could only be played by Danny Devito as he does an excellent job as him. The movie could have got 9 stars but it was let down at the end where it just got way to silly for me and overall stupid. Some fans say that it is not the original story of the Penguin so they don't like it, but it doesn't even matter as the movie is so damn good! Not as good as Batman 1989 or The Dark Knight, but give it a watch and maybe you will enjoy it.",Batman Returns
461,RobTheConqueror,A worthy sequel,7,17 January 2016,"Tim Burton delivered once again with this second great installment in his Batman film series, that would unfortunately be ruined by Joel Schumacher when he took over for the next two installments. But let's forget about that and let's focus on Batman Returns.Everything that was good about the first movie remains here. Michael Keaton delivers an even better performance as Batman than he did in the first film, and it helps that this time he gets more screen time and we delve deeper into his psychosis once his complicated lover/enemy relationship with Selina Kyle/Catwoman comes into play. Michael Gough also remains perfectly cast as Alfred and Gotham City still oozes atmosphere.As for the new additions, Michelle Pfeiffer is perfect as Catwoman, perfectly capturing her seductive, brutal and (for this movies purpose) slightly psychotic personality. Christopher Walken is also a worthy addition as ruthless tycoon Max Shreck, making what could have been a campy character into a cool, sinister and collective one.Danny DeVito as the Penguin is the one aspect of this film I'm torn on. While DeVito gives a memorably fantastic performance, and this version of the Penguin makes for a great character in any other film, he isn't really the Penguin from the comics, and this as usual reeks of Tim Burton's habit of changing source material to suit his own themes (see also, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory). Despite all of this, Devito does shine throughout and his sympathetic, vile character does enough to make you forget the differences from the source material.Another problem is that the script does feel a bit overcrowded at points and it does feel like the script could possibly do without the addition of Shreck.Nevertheless, this a sequel that isn't quite as good as the first installment, but still great nonetheless.",Batman Returns
462,Dorian-Kellaway,"Dark, perverse, engaging but not great",5,6 September 2005,"Batman returns is a strange film definitely worth a watch for any Tim Burton fan. The movie succeeds in its artistic presentation of a cruel dark perverse world, where in the night bizarre things happen. Keaton was the perfect batman but I believe he is wasted in this movie, through Tim Burtons decision to focus primarily on the villains. The scenes he is given he plays well but his dark physcosis is tackled in a somewhat comical way this time round.Burtons art work is great in this film with the designs for the abandoned Antarctic zoo, and city hall. Once again Danny Elfman provides a brilliant dark Gothic neo-classical score.Devito has received mixed reception for his performance as the penguin, he attempts to be larger than life, but he fails in producing a performance as entertaining as Jack Nicholsons the Joker. At many points in the film he is annoying.Michelle Pfeifer does what she can with the Selina Kyle/cat-woman character. Her best moments are when she recovers from an attempted murder and loses complete control trashing her apartment.Christopher Walken is probably the best thing in this film, his character is eccentric engaging and strangely charming. No one could've been better in this role than him, he has such a persuasive intriguing speaking tone, ideal for his manipulating and ca jading of the Penguin, when Christopher Walken speaks he subtly forces you to listen, this is the sign of a great actor.However this film fails in its lack of plot depth, it looks stylish on the surface like all of Tim Burtons movie, but the plot is a little sparse and thrown around. Burtons fundamental flaw as a director is that he focuses on style over substance. In saying this Burtons dark representation of Gotham used in both his films is perfect for the dark knight to inhabit.This film is not up to the standard of the first batman, primarily because Tim Burton was given too much artistic licence, so that he could give the film a complete Tim Burton stylisation.But yet another fault is that, if you decide to make a dark film ,there is no place for cringing lines such as ""eat floor high in fibre"". All in all Batman returns is the second best batman film, but no as Good as the original which places comic book themes in a dark but realistic world, this film places comic book themes in a dark but ridiculous and somewhat perverse world. This is what turned the masses away from it. An art film is never a commercial success, but like many other art films this has achieved cult status.Batman returns is an okay film that could've been much better if Tim Burton had been controlled.",Batman Returns
463,videogamenews,A Tim Burton ego trip more than a Batman movie,2,22 July 2019,"I don't know exactly what went on behind the scenes, but it's clear that Tim Burton (he never did another one) wanted to give Hollywood a big ""F-U"" with this film.While the first one had still some ties with the comics, the sequel is almost a parody. No character has any similarity with the original series, starting with an almost mutant Penguin who's just a mob boss in the comics. Even Batman acts strange (killing people, cracking jokes etc) and is on screen for a very little time.Also, Michael Keaton looks bored in almost all his scenes, and the ""now grey"" costume looks a lot faker than the original. Danny de Vito did well but the character was just badly written. Same with Catwoman: the whole ""cat resurrection"" thing was laughable even back in the days.The only good points are the first scenes with the circus battle (still very good today) and the overall dark/decaying atmosphere that's typical Burton.Too bad nobody was there telling the director that enough is enough sometimes.",Batman Returns

Like the original Batman, Batman Returns provides Bat-fans everywhere with what they want in a Batman film. It is a very original sequel and doesn't copy the first film in any way (unlike Batman & Robin which just seemed like a not so good re-make of Batman Forever). Michael Keaton, once again, plays Batman brilliantly and , once again, the only thing letting him down is his look. He just doesn't look like Batman, plus, I think Batman should be at least six foot whereas Michael Keaton is under six foot.

Tim Burton was a great director of the first two films, and the way this and the first was presented, it became real and gritty (If you don't look at the part where Michelle Pfeiffer has nine lives).

471,pap25,Misunderstood Gem!,10,16 July 2005,"This movie was far from conventional, this time Burton had more freedom to mold Batman into his own vision. He set up to explore the deepest and darkest themes found throughout its long and rich multimedia history all while managing to pay homage to its many diverse depictions and different eras. Burton delivered what is still to this point the most polarizing and controversial interpretation of Batman's history. An uneasy, deliciously dark and humorous, visually striking and sense assaulting experience disguised as a simple straight forward, and campy blockbuster further enhanced by its amazing score, depressive blue Christmas setting, influential production design, creative costume design, rich symbolism and tour de force performances (a career defining for Michelle Pfeiffer).Batman finds himself pitted against and emotionally challenged by 3 ""villains"":A disturbing circus freak with a tragic past, Oswald Cobblepot known as the Penguin, who was abandoned by his wealthy and influential parents and who just like Bruce had his innocence taken from him at a premature age.He feels cheated of a promising life and represents Bruce's life gone wrong as he wishes to inflict pain and for people to suffer the same for what he went through. Unlike Bruce or Selina feels no remorse or conflict, there is no turning back for him. He is understandably pure angst and bitterness and in spite of being an eloquent and highly intelligent individual is mainly driven by his instincts, thirst for revenge, carnal and affection needs making him an easy prey for Max Schrecks' plot.Selina Kyle aka Catwoman, a woman who by trying to better herself ventured out of her comfort zone only to inevitably become the very thing she sought not to, failing to stand out and succeed in a tough male run world where there is no room for a shy, inexperienced, naive girl even if willing, intelligent, thoughtful, honest, hard working and creative, a world where only the fittest survive and the unethical climb while the weak languish in the background. In conclusion everything society molded her to be and all she was entitled to aspire to. She is an innocent, girlish and immature woman predictably fond of the color pink, stuffed animals and cats who is harassed and humiliated at work. A subtle glimpse of her dormant and repressed side is shown at the beginning of the movie after her first encounter with ""the Batman"". Selina discovers her boss', a truly heartless but beloved businessman depicted by the twisted media as a working man of humble upbringing and an uninterested anthropologist Max Schreck, sinister and disguised attempt at blackmailing and taking the city hostage by holding a monopoly on energy which causes her to be disposed of mercilessly by Schreck who corners her and throws her out of a high story window of a skyscraper. She falls on her back on several inches of snow and is symbolically revived by cats and reborn as a self-confident ""executive assistant"" turned vigilante focused on destroying Schreks evil empire and stranglehold on the city. All the while still enjoying her once seemingly unreachable, new fulfilling and limitless self by indulging in what she thought would be a mere diversion. She is sidetracked by Batman and his alter ego Bruce Wayne, she begins to question herself and be scared of what she has become after it appears she has met ""the one"" shattering her once firm and ""cynic"" perspective of life and fracturing her new found confidence, the delicate balance of her duality, her selfish empowerment and forcing her to consider giving up her crusade against injustice and live a normal life with Bruce, reluctantly confirming and accepting the goals of life as dictated by a two faced, hypocrite society which allows men like Max Schrek to come out on top and control the world at will. The dynamic relationship of Bruce and Selina is by far the best, most tragic, erotic romance to date in comic book genre movie. Max Schreck who claims to represent the city itself, and who one day plans to live through his son who will make sure his legacy lives on. He will stop at nothing and no one to accomplish it until he gains full control of the city and the political and justice authorities are his puppets.Batman Returns is a deeper and genuine un-sugar-coated statement on marginalization, class and gender confrontation and alienation in a corrupt and hypocrite world. Despite superficial differences all that separates Batman and his foes are the side of the law they supposedly fight for which is not only blurry but undefined. All the Dark Knight rises only dared to superficially explore failing big time.During the ending credits the main character's themes breathtakingly morph into one another, coincidence?",Batman Returns

Burton dark and Gothic scenes gives Gotham the reign of terror look, makes you believe that batman is needed in Gotham. A film that was ahead of it time. The audience of 1992 wasn't ready for this, but as time as gone on the film has become more liked, maybe the downfall of batman forever and batman and robin, everyone seemed to realise then that this film was very good and should of kept Tim Burton as the director.

It was just horrible.Then halfway through the film, Catwoman is working for the Penguin and she eats his canary.

This film is very dark, but also pretty camp. People complain about Batman Forever for being campy. OK, they may be right. But look closer at the Penguin and the circus gang, and you will understand what I mean. Some of the characters in the gang even have similar Jim Carrey - expressions. And Penguin drop of one bad joke after another. Catwoman howewer is very dangerous, but not just for Batman. And about Batman in this film: he kills !! Batman has sworn to NEVER take a life. In this film he kills of two members of the circus gang, with purpose. This is odd, because in the first film he does not kill of people.He tries to save Jacks Napier when he is about to fall in the acid ! And they made Penguin a monster.

482,paul_oates,Certainly the darkest entry in the Batman series,8,3 February 2002,"While lacking the fabulous villain in the form of Jack Nicholson as the Joker, which made the first film so great, Batman Returns does delve into the more dark and disturbing side of life in Gotham which, although I feel this is a lesser film, has some of the finest moments in the Batman film series.With three main villains competing for screen time with Batman himself, ultimately, none of them are sufficiently developed. One of the most common criticisms of this film is that none of the villains match the Joker. One feels though, if it were just Catwoman or the Penguin in this film then they could have been just as much of a match for the Joker. The Joker is so memorable because Jack Nicholson has so much screen time to play around with the character without force-feeding the audience plot-developing lines of dialogue as many characters in this film are.However Catwoman is simply delightful and alluring, and for me, Max Shrek (Christopher Walken at his most psychotic best) is wonderful. Early scenes between Shrek and Selina Kyle, are the best in the film with Walken being both incredibly menacing and hilariously funny at the same time.",Batman Returns
483,snafuone,Enjoyable sequel to the first!,8,12 December 2007,"I liked this one better than the first. With Michael Keaton returning in the starring role, this one is a hit. Danny DeVito plays a mean, krusty ol Penguin. Christopher Walken, always a treat to see in movies, is in this as shrewd businessman Max Shreck. Lovely Michelle Phiffer plays the sexy feline Catwoman. All three, but not all together and in different pairings, get together to bring down the Dark Knight, but Batman perserveres, and ultimately wins out. I haven't seen ""Batman Begins"" yet, but I did see ""Batman Forever"" and ""Batman and Robin"". IMHO, ""Batman and Robin"" failed miserably, even with top box office draws George Clooney, playing the winged good guy, and Arnold Schwarzenegger, playing badguy Mr. Freeze. I also think ""Batman Forever"" was really good, with Jim Carrey playing the great dual role of Edward E. Nigma/The Riddler. Tommy Lee Jones was also great as Two Face. I still wish Michael Keaton would have reprised his role as the Caped Crusader in ""Batman Forever"", but Val Kilmer performed well in his place. I think this one, and ""Batman Forever"", are both tied as my favorite Batman movies. Like i said, i have yet to see Christian Bale, who put on the cowl for ""Batman Begins"", but it seems that lots of people think he plays the best Batman. If only Adam West were still young.",Batman Returns
484,Phil_Hughes86,Has bettered with Time,7,24 July 2006,"Having watched Batman Begins for a second time two nights ago and coming to the conclusion that I'd overrated it, I thought I'd bring out Tim Burton's much debated Batman Returns. Although Batman 89 remains my favourite over the entire franchise (old and new) I'd never really appreciated just how facile the second instalment was.I'd always liked Returns as a child simply because it was a Batman film. I'd never understood or appreciated the intelligence and artistic style of how it was put together. The entire film is resembles a sad poem. The characters always craved something more than they had but were always cursed never to find retribution.Tim Burton has received plenty of criticism via the use of hindsight for never having explored the true character of Bruce Wayne. I think, perhaps, that is something that works in his favour. Burton's Wayne is an enigma, someone we just can't understand and at all and Michael Keaton pulls this off splendidly. We can see in Keaton's face that there is always a deep rooted pain in every menial action he makes. It is an absolute pity that Burton wasn't allowed to do a 3rd Batman film because that could have made something really special. I'd hazard a guess and say that it would have been a film primarily about Batman, and his battle with his inner demons and origin, thus making the perfect trilogy. Needless to say Warner Brothers felt the need to mess with something that was working.The Catwoman is a divine character. It is typical Tim Burton in the scene where she is pushed from the window and her origin is put into place. Unlike Selina Kyle, Catwoman is sexually heightened, confident and mysterious. She is everything Selina wants to be. Michelle Pfeiffer's performance is wonderful. It is no wonder that we believe Batman to have fallen for her, she almost mirrors him as a character and he says so at the final confrontation ""We're the same. Split, right down the centre."" Danny DeVito also pulls of an Oscar winning performance as the disgusting and rejected Penguin. Underneath his ambitious self, he is merely a horny teenager wanting to experience a little bit of human life. That is why his story is so compelling and we are almost moved to see him die. If you compare this with Schumacher's Two Face then it makes for a much more interesting villain. Max Shreck was perhaps the face of true evil in this film and he eventually gets his comeuppance. I do enjoy the fact that Batman sees right through Shreck but does nothing. Had any other director had this film then I am sure they would have opted for a confrontation once Bruce had discovered the truth.The movie, altogether I think, is an intelligent dark comedy. As someone has previously mentioned in these reviews it really isn't what you would expect of a Batman film. If you want a version that stays faithful the original idea and is so suave then Begins is the answer. If you are after something a little discrepant then look no further than Tim Burton's versions. For the love of God stay away from the last two catastrophe's. Me, well I appreciate both Begins and Burton's.",Batman Returns
485,amberlese,One of the Two Greatest Batman films!,8,31 July 2012,"The two Greatest Batman films of all time have been & will always be, The Dark Night & Batman Returns. Part of the reason why The Dark Knight was so perfect, was because of Heath Ledger, who played the Joker flawlessly. Part of the reason that, Batman Returns, was so great, was because of, Michelle Pfeiffer, who was the greatest woman to ever play the role of Catwoman, So brilliantly. Batman Returns was the second greatest Batman movie of all time. The Dark Knight remains the greatest batman movie in history. Side note: The Dark Knight Rises, still remains in it's rightful place, as by far, The WORST Batman movie of all time.",Batman Returns
486,thecomputeraddict28,"Move over Nolan-this is the ""dark"" knight",7,22 June 2013,"My friends will know I have a mixed opinion of Nolans batman films. Begins was dull, TDK was pretty cool and TDKR....well, we have batman and robin to contend with worst batman movie.I say this as my friends say ""the old films are to light hearted"" I reply ""Go watch batman returns"" This film takes influences both from Batman and Burton's film he made just before this, Edward Scissorhands. The latter was Burton's personal favourite film, and for this film, he wanted to bring something new to the table.Batman returns has the Gothic, almost fairy tale like feel of Scissorhands-a dark, twisted fairy tale anyway. This is due to impressive production design, and Danny Elfmans score, which has the choir elements added in for that Burton feel.Keaton returns and once again impresses as batman. He isn't in that much (more than in TDKR though) but he brings a real pressence on screen. He is in my eyes the true Batman. Danny DeVito is the warped penguin and he is a very interesting, if vile, character. A great costume and make up team make him a great villain. Although he is not the crime boss from the comics, the abandoned mutant makes him a more sympathetic villain- only Aaron Eckhart is more sympathetic than penguin in the batman films. Michelle Pfeiffer is the scene stealer here as catwomen. Her demented take on the anti hero is very engaging and she has one of the coolest costumes ever. Finally Christopher Walken appears as corrupt tycoon Max Schrek. He is basically playing himself-which is awesome, as he is Christopher Walken.So we have a strong cast-what about the story? While it's morbid and dark, it's very interesting. Its complex and not realistic but is very powerful-but not uplifting. As for the production, Gotham looks as dark as it will ever look-its mostly set at night. Its a memroble setting, but not comic book-y-more Tim Burton-y. The music gets the tone of the film across very well-Danny Elfman has composed a real gem here.The action however is a bit lackluster-the music holds it together, making it seem more exciting. The biggest problem the film has is that its not a comic book movie-it does change the villains backstories, batman is slightly to immoral and the story doesn't have the simple plots or action to make it a comic book movie. Although its not the best representation of batman or comic book movies, and a disappointment compared to its predecessor, its a great watch if your into the dark worlds of Tim Burton-defiantly the dark knights darkest hour.",Batman Returns
487,Benedict02,Burtonesque At its Finest,9,17 January 2018,"Not only is ""Batman Returns"" the best Batman film in the original anthology, it is also one of Tim Burton's best films. The sets are superb and dark-a vast improvement from the seemingly oil canvas backgrounds of Batman (1989)-Bo Welch and the set designers done a magnificent job capturing the vibe of Gotham City. The most impressive set is the Penguin's Lair, which contained several live Penguins and over half a million gallons of water; despite it's horror vibe it is the most familiar and aesthetically pleasing set. The exterior of Gotham is very reminiscent of Fritz Lang's Metropolis (1927).In typical Burton fashion, parents are presented in a negative light; this is seen at the start of the film-in the most memorable opening to a Batman movie, as well as Danny Elfman's superb track ""Birth of a Penguin."" Oswald Cobblepot is abandoned at birth for his grotesque, Penguin-like features, he is placed in a basket and thrown into a river which eventually leads him to the ""Arctic World"" beneath ""Gotham Zoo."" I suppose that's what happens when Pee-Wee Herman (Paul Reubens) is your father. The Penguin's abandonment has several similarities to the story of Moses featured in the book of Exodus in the Bible; this theme is further explored as Penguin's main plan is to capture and kill all first born sons of Gotham, by drowning them in the sewer.Danny DeVito's portrayal of the penguin is magnificent, he is funny, strangely charming, evil, psychotic and the viewer can not help but feel sympathetic for his character; i often struggle holding back the tears when his death scene arrives-yet again made better by Elfman's superb score.Michael Keaton reprises his role as Batman, he is even more brooding and impressive in this much darker sequel. Michelle Pfeiffer is amazing at playing Catwoman. She is seen at first playing the pathetic Selena Kyle until she is killed and ""re-born"" as Catwoman; the perfectly dark, sinister and sexy character for the Burtonesque Universe.Christopher Walken plays the shrewd businessman Max Shreck, his name is the same of the German actor who plays ""Count Orlok"" in ""Nosferatu,"" this s also referenced in the film; before Shreck pushes Selena out of a window he looks as though he goes to bite her neck. His performance is so dastardly brilliant you can't help liking him, despite his evil persona.Batman Returns has an amazing cast, director, soundtrack, script, plot and set designs; every second is entertaining and the dark setting adds to the Gothic vibe. The colours used are very similar to those used in early silent German horror films-most notably ""The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari."" Burton captures the true essence of Batman in this movie, it's even enjoyable if you're not a fan of the caped crusader.",Batman Returns

After giving The joker a terrible beating ,Batman should have met some other challenge - more dangerous and furious than the penguin, and a angry woman.There has to be some development and progress to keep the suspense and action going - this story is lacking in both and I think that Batman is facing clowns in a theater this time.Although both the penguin and Catwomen gives some fight - they are no threat to Batman ever,I think - I must admit - I am not a bit disappointed,but very .",Batman Returns

It's by no means a perfect movie (and admittedly it does pale in comparison to the previous movie), but it is definitely not a bad movie. My only major problem with this movie is some elements of the story. The writing is pretty flawed and some parts of the story need better explanations. But overall everything else about this movie is great and still holds up. The visuals and art designs in this movie are great and the music is amazing. The movie is also more action packed and fun than the first one. The cast also does a really great job in their roles and are arguably the best thing about the movie. Michael Keaton plays a great mysterious Batman, Michelle Peiffer plays a great sexy Catwoman, and Danny Devito was a perfect casting choice for the Penguin. Both Catwoman and The Penguin are great scary and tragic villains with personality and Batman is badass in this movie. The movie also has lots of memorable moments that keep you entertained and is overall the most dark and mature Batman movie we have ever seen. People complain about the movie being dark but it's a Batman movie. What did they expect? He's supposed to be dark. Overall, definitely an underrated sequel.",Batman Returns

In my humble opinion, just fighting either the Catwoman alone or the Penguin alone would have had a tighter dramatic structure.  However, watching a flock of penguins waddling around with missiles strapped to their backs, supposedly a threat to the citizens Gotham City, was unintentionally one of the funniest scenes I've ever seen.",Batman Returns
491,TheFly-2,The Best Batman,8,9 March 2002,"This film has really been unfairly lambasted over the past decade or so since its release.  I feel that its reputation comes from the darkness of the film and also from the fact that McDonald's marketed it to youngsters by throwing Batman Returns toys into their Happy Meals.  This is not a child's movie, nor is it the first film.Batman was a triumph in its own right, but I find this second film to be superior.  The characters are interesting, the scenery is spectacular (Michelle Pfeiffer included), and the script is actually very well done. Every time I watch this film I pick up more subtleties.  One of my favorites is when Penguin visits his parents grave and says, ""I was their number one son, but they treated me like number two.""  This line has a great double-meaning.  Penguin being treated like a number two son, not quite as well loved or cherished, but also Penguin being treated like number two, as in bodily function, in the less vulgar vernacular, crap.  There are many lines just like this one laced throughout the film.  It is true, the screenplay does have a few holes in it, especially towards the end of the film, but it turns out to be very enjoyable.  There is great character development to be found with Bruce Wayne maturing and Selina Kyle having to deal with her newfound duality.  The relationship between Selina and Bruce is the most interesting of any of the films.  While the Penguin and bad guy Max Shreck are static characters, they really do contribute to the feel and plot of the film.  Heck, Penguin drives the main plot, or is it Shreck that drives it?  You decide.The Batman series would go downhill from this point.  Batman Forever is actually pretty good, although Schumacher's vision is a little to ""bright"" for my tastes.  Batman & Robin is one of the worst films I've EVER seen. It's no wonder that we haven't seen a Batman film since its release. Batman Returns and the first film really make Batman and Gotham City seem real.

Keaton's sullen, middle-aged, nerdy Bruce Wayne is awful. At least Schumacher gives us a millionaire playboy Bruce Wayne, and a Batman that can fight in the follow up to Burton/Keaton's garbage film.

494,h_proudfoot,Truly the last great of the Batman films...,8,29 December 1999,"This is Batman at its finest. Keaton and Pfieffer have electrifying chemistry; DeVito delivers as the Penguin, mayoral prospect turned pariah; Christopher Walken turns out a humorous performance of corporate cannibal Max Shreck; Burton's creatively chilling visions of Gotham and the old zoo truly capture the eye (even more so than the cathedral and tall skyscrapers of the original); Elfman's score is simply astounding, mournfully majestic, and never fails to completely encompass the mood of a character or scene. Siouxsie and the Banshees theme song ""Face to Face"" definitely suits the style and atmosphere of the film more than the artist formerly known as Prince and U2, combined. Returns is by far the best of the series, as well as one of the best sequels of all time, a visual masterpiece to be long remembered.The original film is excellent, as it introduces Batman to the city of Gotham and allowing Bruce revenge for the death of his parents. There had to be a second film, however, that showed Batman as a renowned hero to the city, to fulfill his shoes as a super hero. Returns is that film, as well as one of the few sequels to surpass the quality of the original (Like The Godfather and Toy Story), based on the opinion that this is the STORY of Batman whereas the original was merely the prologue, the introduction (although Robert Wuhl is greatly missed in this picture).This is Michael Keaton's sexiest role, and the sexiest Batman. He is the first, the best, the only. Batman has a great deal to do with sex appeal (at least on the big screen), while Bruce Wayne is about humanity's flaws. Keaton is the only actor to pull off both these characteristics. While Kilmer and Clooney are hunks as Bruce Wayne, their faces are altered, for the worse, by the mask. Kilmer's face is suctioned onto the rubber and Clooney is eaten alive by it. Keaton, on the other hand, is not disfigured by the mask. He looks sexier as Batman than as Bruce Wayne, as it should be, and his Batman is sexier than both his successors hunky Bruce Waynes and clumsy Batmans. Keaton has those bright green eyes shining against the dark makeup, and those luscious, lick-able lips of his, oh my. Keaton is the sexiest Batman, and also the most believable Bruce Wayne. He is the only actor of the three to successfully disguise himself, remaining nearly unrecognizable behind the mask (not to mention he can actually pull off comedic scenes. The others were just too stiff). He alters his voice and the duplicity of his disguise is believable. The other two are plainly obvious (to the extent of Clark Kent and his glasses) and easily identified. The Batsuit in Returns, along with Keaton's face, are the most effective in concealing Batman's true identity.The relationship between Bruce and Selina is better written and played out than that of either Vale or Meridian (was there even a love interest in the fourth?). The recognition of Batman's identity in Returns is one of the most breathtaking scenes of the series, and greatly surpasses that of Vale simply walking into the Batcave unscathed and unconcerned. Returns also integrated its predecessor into the story. Vicki is mentioned, along with her sudden departure from Bruce's life. I was disappointed with Forever when neither Vale nor Catwoman's presence are breached upon. It's as if this is a different city and a different Batman (which they practically are, Harvey Dent went from being the smooth talking Billy Dee Williams to the southern drawled Tommy Lee Jones). The Bruce and Selina relationship is by far the most promising and befitting of the series. It makes the most sense and falls more into character than any of the others. Pfieffer's Catwoman is a stunning performance by a stunning actress, and she truly is the highlight of the film.The missile mounted penguins aren't a problem, as it follows the fantasy of the film and its loose take on reality. The plot, although not the most clever, has its highlights in the fact that every small detail plays a role (Selina's stun gun, Penguin's lists, Batman's boomerang, Max's gun) in the grand scheme. The awkward approach on the villains is also intriguing. The fact that the Penguin wasn't the same as the comics, and that he was a mistreated child with physical deformities (to say the least) adds an obscurity and sympathy to the character that I felt greatly lacked with the Joker (as well as Two-Face, and I won't even start on Mr. Freeze). The other villain, Max Shreck, is a wonderful character (although seeming dull, is actually quite interesting, and well played by the bedazzling Walken), especially his habit of botching up common phrases. ""I've got better fish to fry,"" and ""If it works, don't fix it,"" are just two of the examples that make this character, like the film itself, a gem, truly one of a kind.Batman Returns: 9.995 (rounded up to ten)",Batman Returns
495,greggbray,"A film rich in subtext, which makes up for faulty plotline",10,13 September 2000,"True, I was wondering where the Penguin got the blueprints, as well as how those bats got stuffed in the Christmas tree.  Yes, friends, this film is a flawed piece of art.  But it is still rich in the gothic mythos that makes the comic book so grand.  Each character is handed a frail psychological make up. The Penguin, though a departure from the comics, clearly defines an idea set up in the DC universe. The villains are tragic.  They all have splits, and are driven mad by a set of circumstances.  Each character demonstrates a distinct duality--while Catwoman and Batman mirror each other brilliantly. ""Gothic"" is explored through the gargoylesque Shreck cat statues, to subtle vampire references.  Bo Welch's sets are reminiscent of German impressionistic silent films from the Penguin's fake hypnotic umbrella (an image virtually lifted from 'Dr. Caligari' to the character Max Shreck, named from the 'Nosferatu' actor in Murnau's films.

496,greggbray,"Brilliant, intertextual, and over looked.",10,11 February 2001,"Sincere parody is never a recepiant of praise in this country.  Batman Returns, released on an election year, is a case in point.  Not only does it mock corporate control over American politicians, but it also, in itself, is a parody of our culture. To say that the film satirical is an undergesture. Christopher Walken's Max Shreck, the polluting industrialist, and his manipulation of the Penguin is a clear demonstration of this. The intertextual refereces to the silent era are endless.  From the visuals that inspire remembrances of German impressionism (the set production, and even the Penguin swirling his hypnotic umbrella, is ala Dr. Caligari) to Max Shrech (the name lifted from actor Max Shreck who played the vampire in Nosferatu--even Max's activities, sucking the power out of Gotham, is reminiscent of a vampire sucking the blood ((life force)) out of humans.) Batman, of course, is the gargoyle over all this, and his cape is full, not only with these terrors, but also with Catwoman, his doppleganger.  Here we see a circle of sameness that is not explored with any of the characters in the film series-at least not to this degree. The performances are top notch, the production design is gorgeous, and it is wrought with meaning on ever conceivable level.  This is the type of film that Gilles Deleuze would have a field day with.  So many images of affect and perception that virtually colide together to form a visual tapestry unlike any other.  To say this is style over substance is dismissive and wrong. The substance of the film is built in a rich visual fabric that incorporates parody, our cultural folklore heros, images, performances, and a sense of loss.  Batman is the ultimate anti hero, and Burton is a cinematic hero for bringing these various elements together on the screen.",Batman Returns
497,Jughead_Pwns,"Will, can't blame Burton for trying...I think.",1,9 December 2006,"I do not like this movie at all, actually hated it, and this is coming from a loyal Batman fan. Every time Tim Burton makes a movie he constantly tries to remind you that you're watching a ""burton film"" rather then just a movie, and for Batman Returns, it's just that. I stopped watching this after my love for ""Mask Of The Phantasm"" came to DVD. Batman is still a homicidal maniac who hasn't been locked up in Arkham yet, speaking of Arkham Aslyum, where is it? Burton just rathered to kill off the criminals rather then adding the influential mad house from the comics. Batman is yet again playing second fiddle to the villains, having the Dark Knight in only about 25 minutes of the movie. Anyways, I'll get to the point. There is a new nutjob running around Gotham...wait? in the sewers? Finally, Killer Croc is introduced to the movies. No, wait....that's not Croc...that's...the Penguin? Burton portrayed Oswald Cobblepot as a sewer mutant freak, with feces on his pajama bottoms, puking black and green mucus from his mouth with an army of penguins with rocket launchers on their backs, marching around the town like nazi soilders from the '40s. The Penguin has always been a sophisticated gentlemen, a rich greedy crimeboss and owns a local dance club. Oswald always only carried an umbrella with him because his father died of pneumonia when he was a kid, and his loving mother didn't want him to catch it. In Batman Returns, his parents hated him, disown him and threw him into a river. Catwoman was shown as a psychopathic terrorist, killing random strangers and blowing up everything in her path when she was thrown out of a window and revived when cats tried to eat her. This movie is poorly plotted. Burton disregards anything he sees in the comic book and makes it his version and to me; that is not the Batman I grew up to love.",Batman Returns
498,mdiffey,The best of the bunch,8,27 October 2002,"For anyone who claims that this film doesn't live up to the original, I strongly advise them to actually go back and watch that film- then be shocked by the desperately slow pace, complete lack of action and unengaging character interaction.  While Batman Returns is by no means a perfect film, it must be remembered that this was a major summer blockbuster- and as such, it is surprising just how dark the whole thing is.Keaton is excellent, although slightly underused- De Vito does just about as much as he can to invest the Penguin with some sort of character- Pfeiffer just about convinces- and Christopher Walken is as sinister as ever.  The action set-pieces are completely overblown, but fantastically exciting, and the slightly downbeat ending perfectly complements the legend of the Dark Knight.In retrospect, the Batman series as a whole has never been anywhere near to approaching greatness (the least said about the last two films, the better), but at least Burton did make a great Batman movie.

Here we have a genuinely gripping story and one of the best female performances of the decade- by Michelle Pfeiffer. She is positively luminous as Catwoman and sizzles on screen. The Penguin, played by an OTT Danny deVito is less successful by comparison.Batman Returns is surreal and menacing in equal measure. Upping the weirdo quotient is Chris Walken, who alas has little to do. The camera-work and production design are an improvement on the first film. This film has both style and substance. Only in the loud climax does Burton fall prey to commercial instincts and substitutes razzmatazz for action.

His eyes behind the mask say more in a second than this whole ""Batman & Robin"" crap did in two hours (or did not to be honest). Walken and DeVito give fantastic performances and Michelle Pfeiffer IS Catwoman. I am so grateful Annette Benning didn't get the role (thanks to Warren Beatty for making her pregnant). Michelle Pfeiffer's performance is one of the most erotic I've ever seen in a mainstream movie. Go and see it! It's just great!",Batman Returns
503,Mr-Awesome,A daring Super Hero film that does something different,5,12 January 2009,"Batman Returns is an odd beast, as it is not really a Batman film nor is it a super hero film. It's very much a quirky art film disguised as a super hero film. Despite the title,this movie is really about the Penguin, his rejection at birth for being deformed, his ascension in the public eye, and rise to power and his fall and eventual rejection of humanity. Batman merely serves as a spectator of the events in this movie having little to do except have sexual tension with the other villain Catwoman. (Michael Keaton and Michelle Pfiefer have the best chemistry of any Batman movie by the way). Speaking of Catwoman by the way, while The Penguin may be the film's main character , it Michelle Pfeifer's performance as Selina Kyle A.K.A Catwoman that really makes this movie worth watching. Miss Pfiefer does a great job playing the mousy secretary pushed to madness. In fact the two most powerful scenes in this movie are owned by Michelle Pfiefer. The scene where Selina Kyle has her psychotic breakdown and wrecks her apartment and the scene where Batman offers her a fairy tale ending of happiness which she rejects for revenge against the man who wronged her. This film is perhaps the most pessimistic comic book film of all time. Every character in this movie loses. Penguin loses his acceptance in to society, Catwoman loses her fairy tale ending, and Batman loses any chance of a normal life. When watching the end of this movie one has to wonder if Bruce Wayne isn't contemplating hanging up the cape and cowl for good. You might be wondering why I gave this film a 5 out of 10 even though I've been gushing over it so much, the simple fact is despite it's title Batman Returns is hardly a Batman film, this film belongs to it's villains and why one of the rules is a super hero is only as good as his villains that doesn't mean the movie should almost all but ignore it's hero. That said I am recommending this film because it is in my opinion the most daring comic book film.",Batman Returns
504,donstamegna,Utter crap,1,30 March 2010,"This movie is by far one of the worst super hero films ever, it's on par with Superman 4. Bruce Wayne just sits in his study waiting for the Bat Signal to call him (and what the heck is up with all those reflectors mounted on Wayne Manor? I guess the next time the house needs a roof repair the secrets out). Tim Burton has a way of making humanity look disgusting and he want way over the top in this stink fest. Here are some of the major issues. Batman punches through the floorboards of the almost indestructible Batmobile. He easily rips through his bullet proof outfit to, yet again, reveal his secret identity (and notice the lack of black eye makeup). I don't know what to say about the penguins other than WTF?!?! And a secretary who gets thrown out of a window, gets bitten by cats, and suddenly has the ability to perform acrobatics, is a great fighter, and is a master with a bull whip. This movie was supposed to come out at Christmas time, but in need of serious reediting in order to make it look like something beyond the level of a 3rd grader with a camcorder it was pushed to the following summer. They should have worked a little harder. This movie was not a Batman movie. It was Tim Burton fixing something that was never broken. Thank God Batman Begins came out to show the world how Batman should be done. Realistically and serious.",Batman Returns
505,CrazyJustin1785,This one is the one to light the Bat Signal for!,10,24 September 2009,"Batman Returns It is my opinion that the first Batman of the Batman series was only half the movie that Batman Returns is. In the first Batman by Tim Burton we had only Batman and The Joker both played wonderfully by Michael Keaton and Jack Nicholson.In Batman Returns we have what I feel is the most perfectly cast Batman movie (yes even better then Dark Knight). Keaton returns as Batman and is perfect in the role never going to far over top with the character of Batman, which is perfect in this film when it comes to the two villains that he's up against. First you have Danny DeVito who is delightfully insane as the Penguin. Then you have Michelle Pfeiffer as Cat-Woman, who I dare to say is one of the most interesting and complex villains in the Batman movies. I feel this way about Pfeiffer because of the way she becomes the Cat-Woman she starts off as the rather pathetic mousy Selena Kyle and then truly dives into the dark side of her mind and what you get is a brilliant performance of a woman who goes from trying to be a hero to a villain and then I suppose back to a hero in the end. Also in this amazing cast you have the evil businessman Max Schreck played by the amazing and legendary Christopher Walken. While in a supporting role there's something about this role that I love and maybe it's the look of Schreck in the film that makes his performance all the better then it already is.Story wise I have to say that Batman Returns has so much more going on this time around as opposed to the first Batman. Part of the reason I loved this story so much is the fact that Burton dared to go in a much more darker and twisted direction as opposed to Nicholson's over the top antics. You have the story on the Penguin and how he tries to deceive the people of Gotham into making him the new hero and mayor of the city. Then you have Cat-Woman and her struggle to decide just who she really is and what she should do with her new persona. When it comes to Batman I feel that in this one he's more the ring leader that holds the two stories together but of course kicking ass at the same time.Cinematography was the film is dark and atmospheric just like the story that's taking place within it. Gotham City never looked as good as it does on Blu-Ray and HD so if you have the chance to see it this way then by all means do because it truly adds to the overall experience of Batman Returns.So all in I truly feel that of all the Batman movies Batman Returns believe it or not tops the Dark Knight for me because while I enjoyed that movie for Heath Ledger's amazing performance as the Joker I felt that the movie was lacking something. Batman Returns lacks nothing, so if you want to see an amazing film with what I feel is a perfect cast then this is the Batman to light the Bat signal for.",Batman Returns
506,BuddingMovieMaker,An incredibly complex comic-book film,10,18 January 2004,"Unlike Tim Burton's first film in the Batman franchise, ""Batman Returns"" is a completely satisfying romp through the perilous city of Gotham (which is so beautifully realized by the ingenious Bo Welch)and a quite moving study of loneliness. This is by far the best comic-book film made yet, and the only which successfully maintains a sense of fun and depth.Michael Keaton is a terrific Batman and Bruce Wayne, and is given more interesting quirks now than in the previous film. Danny Devito, quite possibly the most underrated actor in Hollywood, is brilliant as the literate, emotionally desolate Penguin(A.K.A. Oswald Cobblepot). Catwoman is played to perfection by Michelle Pfeiffer in one of her showiest roles, and Christopher Walken is hysterical as millionaire madman, Max Shreck. Burton uses his excesses to the film's advantage, such as clowns and a gloomy, domineering Gotham. The symbolism of the film isn't played in an obvious fashion, and asks the viewer to look more into the hearts of the characters than their surroundings. The first ""Batman"" suffered from a lack of complex characters, and its incredible art-direction took center stage (as well as an Oscar).""Batman Returns"" is a deep psychological study of childhoods gone wrong, and the results are thought-provoking, cartoonishly wonderful, darkly hilarious, and mesmerisingly different",Batman Returns
507,rmizzi-1,This is not BATMAN,4,16 July 2008,"I'll always remember the anticipation I had for this film back in the summer of 1992 a young 15 year old kid who was still feeling the euphoria of Batman 89' . That film in my opinion brought Batman to life and made people forget about the campy Batman. Batman 89' was not only dark it was heroic and for me it was THE definitive Batman movie.So when it was announced that another Batman movie was going to be produced I was very excited and expected it to be just more of the same with some new villains. I really hoped that Two Face would be the main villain but when it was announced that Catwoman and the Penguin will be the villains I didn't protest because I thought that they might do the job.Anyway the big day came : Premiere night. Now in those times there was now internet to give away plot details so I'll I Knew is that it's Batman against Catwoman and the Penguin. I still had tremendous anticipation. But as the film started I was starting to doubt whether I was in the wrong theater as the Penguin's origin came up . Throughout the film my heart sank as I watched this poor excuse for a Batman film.After watching the film a couple times more I tried to analyze why I ,a Batman fan do not like this film and the reason is simple it is not a "" Batman"" film it is just Tim Burton taking Batman his own way,this macabre, morose, dark abomination was a Batman film in name only .Quite frankly and excuse my language the film's plot Sucked !! What is it all about ...is it about Batman? And if so, just what the heck was he doing besides standing around brooding  seemingly a secondary character to the villains? The Penguin story was pathetic , after living in sewers with his stupid Red Circus Gang he tries to become Mayor of the City and almost succeeds !! I also found nothing appealing about the kidnapping and the potential murder of young children?Also you have these penguins with rockets attached to their back about to attack Gotham ! Penguins for God's sake !! This was the best and most exciting climax they could come up with for this film? On top of an already cluttered film, you have this Max Shreck,a character who was never in the comics tossed into the mix. What was the point of his preposterous power plant storyline? He wants to build a new power plant for Gotham, and Bruce opposes him. Wow, that's interesting! A ray of hope in this film and this why it gets 4 stars is the Catwoman story line which was told well.Another thing which angered me and which made me ask the question : is this really a sequel to Batman 89' ? I really don't think so ! so many things are different . Gotham City looks different ,cluttered and small. What happened to Harvey Dent ? Vicki Vale ? Alexander Knox ? The old mayor ? Nothing is present or is explained.Finally, just when did The Batman do anything ""heroic"" in BATMAN RETURNS? I wanted to see Batman do some classic ""Batman stuff"" like chase down and dispense justice to street thugs, crime kingpins, and the like. How about some iconic, Batman-like poses once in a while? When, at anytime in this film, did you feel like Batman was saving the day? When he's taking on the Red Circus Gang? When he's foiling the Penguin's kidnapping plans? When he's saving Gotham from a mass of missile-equipped Penguins? Come on ! Batman is a superhero, yet there is nothing heroic about BATMAN RETURNS. There isn't one moment in this depressing film where we are given the iconic, heroic Batman. Never does this film offer anything a Batman fan can feel good or proud about. There is nothing about this Batman that makes you want to cheer.But now here comes the questions is Batman Returns the worst Bat-film ever ? Well in my opinion this can be put it one sentence.Batman Returns is a Great Tim Burton film, a bad and weird film and a horrible Batman film So if you are a Tim Burton film you'll like this film , if you are a normal movie goer you'll find this film ""weird "" and if you are a Batman fan like me you'll hate this film.Luke Mizzi 4/10 ****",Batman Returns

510,bat-lev6,Not your kids Batman,9,29 December 1998,This is a tale worthy of the comic books.  The dark tones used by Burton are excellent. Elfman adds a score that almost rivals as his in Batman. All turned in good acting performances.The film gives the studio required love interest by  using the natural chemistry between Catwoman and Batman. Rent it watch it make your own opionion.,Batman Returns
511,MM2000,This is truly Catwoman's movie--Penguin should have been removed from the script...,8,24 March 1999,"The first and only ambitious sequel to ""Batman"" falls short of the original because it is overburdened with characters. This fatal flaw only becomes more pronounced in subsequent sequels.  The Penguin (played by Danny DeVito) and all of his cohorts should have been eliminated from the script. This movie is really about Catwoman, a riveting role performed by the ever-lovely Michelle Pfieffer. Like Michael Keaton's character in the first film, Pfieffer's character, a traumatized secretary who survives a murderous shove from a twelfth-story window, finds that her experience has brought out an unnerving and lunatic dark side. The chemistry is excellent between Pfieffer and her psychotic, corporate executive boss (played by Christopher Walken) and, at first, seems quite engaging between her and Keaton. Indeed, she is Batman's feminine side: his missing half. Unfortunately, the Batman-Catwoman relationship is not developed to the degree it should have been due to the distractions created by DeVito's character. Nevertheless, flawed as it may be, this is the one Batman sequel that is definitely worth seeing.",Batman Returns

I started watching ""Batman begins"" and the following two movies and then I get attached to the concept of Batman . Then I started watching ""Gotham"" and now I decided to watch the 1989 and maybe later I will start reading the comics.The main points that I will comment on are 1- I felt that the movies at that time are more addressed to young audience that to adults . Like when Penguin says I will kidnap all kids . I felt like Disney movie . 2- Now the stories are more realistic than what is was . Like how the penguin is raised inside a Zoo and he looks educated although he never went to school, and the way he controls the Animal Penguins.Over all , I think the movie is excellent and I loved watching it and part of my enjoyment is to see how the movies industry evolving through time not only in terms of technology , but also in term of story telling and roll play.",Batman Returns
513,zakkburnell,A Work of Art the whole way through!!,10,22 July 2020,"Tim Burton sets the bar for superhero films once again. First with Batman (1989) then with Batman Returns. As you can tell from the film's title, Batman (Michael Keaton) Returns. The caped crusader manages to deal with two famous supervillains, The Penguin (Danny DeVito) and Catwoman (Michelle Pfieffer), without the film feeling overwhelming. DeVito's performance is outstanding and iconic. Pfieffer brings life to the role, more than we saw in the 60's. Perhaps the best scene in the film is when Selina Kyle and Bruce Wayne find out each others true identities. This scene is so powerful and has truly magnificent writing. Everything about this film is amazing and is definitely worth a watch if you haven't already. Tim Burton, kudos to you!",Batman Returns
514,alexandra_kuhne,Second parts...,8,12 October 2006,"The first movie was better. But I still liked this one. The Pinguin was a little bit gross, but it's OK. It's the spirit of the comic. I loved seeing Catwoman in the movie. I think, in this case, they didn't achieve getting the spirit of the comic. In the movie she looks like a spoiled girl, who wants to do bad things just because. The character isn't like this in the comic. They don't show that she's a thief. It's good for a first approach. It has an open ending, which means that she could come back. And maybe then, the real Catwoman spirit could emerge. But well, I still love Tim Burton and hes darkness. It fits Batman. And to Batman himself: I love the way Michael Keaton plays it. He's the best Batman of all!",Batman Returns
515,matruglion,Liked it better than part 1,8,18 October 2021,Batman returns is definitely a much darker and better film then the first one but had a more cheesy villain but never the less a good film and it's probably the best out of all the original batman movies.,Batman Returns
516,brownish_33,"Wow, this had got to be the best Batman movie EVER!!",10,19 November 2006,"forget the over-rated ""Batman Begins, THIS is the ultimate Batman movie that you are not gonna want to miss out on. this movie has everything, and it totally surpasses the first 1989 mega hit. it may not have done as well as the first one in at the box office, but this is certainly a much better film. the visuals are amazing, Burton works his magic as he always does in his films once again. Gotham city, Batmans hunting ground, is an amazing sight to behold. the story itself is actually quite good and the 2 villains in this one are VERY interesting, much more interesting in fact then there comic book counterparts. Tim Burton and screenplay writer Daniel Walters go a step further to bring you a truly emotional connection with these characters. the Penguin, played to perfection by Danny Devito, is a type of tragic character who was abandoned by his parents at birth and later in life seeks revenge on the world that denied him. very disgusting to watch at times, but he has some of the most classic lines a villain could ever utter in a single film. the other villain is Catwoman, played so absolutely brilliantly by Michelle Pfieffer, one of the most beautiful actresses of our time and gives a WOW performance, and totally steals the show as far any of the past and present live action batman villain's is concerned. she also has a tragic background. her name is Selina kyle, and she is a very put-upon, mousy secretary for a shrewd business man called Max Shreck, who later murders her by shoving her out a window. somehow, she survives and is ""awakened"" by cats, and decides right then and there to become the legendary Catwoman, not before, of course, the amazing sequence in which she completely lets loose and wrecks her entire apartment in one of the most Oscar worthy performance's of rage and anger i have ever seen in an actress.Michael Keaton once again dons the cape and cowl as Batman and also as Bruce Wayne and THIS time hes much darker. there's not much else to say here except that Keaton is simply the best actor to play Batman ever. he just oozes cool, and he has a kind of Clint Eastwood approach to playing Batman, and he is very dark. he doesn't talk a lot, and when he does, he sounds very cool and he doesn't make his voice sound all goofy and fake IE bales ""batman"" voice in batman begins. he struts around Gotham like a man possessed by his own inner demons. he's pshycologically disturbed, and you know it. in this outing he takes on 2 of the most famous baddies to ever grace the batman comic book world.i have to say though, despite the awesomeness of the action scenes, like the scenes with the coolest Batmobile EVER racing down the street knocking thugs to the ground and batman gliding across Gotham, its the romantic angle between Pfieffer and Keaton that really makes this movie classic a top choice for anyone who wants to see the REAL Batman in action, i rate this a 10, would give it more if i could.",Batman Returns

I first saw it when I was 7 years old and then I didn't know what to think of it. Now 9 years on, I have acquired it and watched it over 10 ten times. The movie blows me away - and it's one aspect only - Catwoman. The movie itself was ok and I wouldn't say the storyline was that great. I like this one the best out of the four films, because it is darker and a much better cast. Christopher Walken is fantastic, Michael Keaton is the best Batman out of them all, Danny DeVito is such a gifted actor and Michelle Pfeiffer is one of the most beautiful and intelligent actresses in movie history. The best aspect of the movie is Catwoman/Selina Kyle played by the very talented Michelle Pfeiffer. Pfeiffer brings wit, intelligence and that bad girl 'thang' in her portrayal of Catwoman. She easily has the best lines and she delivers them perfectly. 8 out 10 OR *** out of *****",Batman Returns

But you must look past the red tape, and realize the sure brilliance of Burton's direction and style. This Batman represents everything Batman should be.I would recommend this movie to any movie goer who watches movies for what a movie should be, and not what a movie is supposed to be. P.S. Tim Burton is god",Batman Returns
519,PhilthySkankPhilanthropist,What a waste of a perfectly good joint...,1,21 July 2008,"I enjoy watching movies when I'm high. As 'The Dark Knight' came close to theaters I decided to watch Tim Burton's 'Batman Returns' to hype my anticipation. What a waste of a Joint that was. This movie made me almost fall asleep. It was just too boring. As a loyal fan to the comics I absolutely refuse to believe that was the Penguin on screen. Killer Croc is more like it. Burton's version of the Penguin consist of a sewer mutant deformed freak who was raised and yes - educated by NAZI penguins with Rocket Launchers on his back. After the Penguins changing his diapers, feeding him and teaching him how to talk proper English grammar he rises from the Sewer to try and become Mayor of Gotham City. Sounds like a comedy? it's not. it's a movie that tries too hard to be serious. Things only get worst when Selina Kyle falls to her death out of a window and becomes the menacing 'Catwoman' after being half aten by Cats. It takes at least 20 minutes in between takes to see the hero of the story (Batman - In case you were wondering). This movie doesn't really have much of a plot. If you want to see it I'm not going to stop you. But don't say I didn't warn you.",Batman Returns
520,sandroalgra,Still my favorite Batman movie but wait... let me tell you why!,8,17 October 2008,"I've enjoyed this movie ever since I was a kid and I still do. I also liked Batman forever back then but the real difference is that THIS movie didn't date when I grew up. I did notice a few scenes in this film that didn't make any sense like: 'Hhmm... the crowd is angry. Hey! Where did they get those tomatoes from?' Then I thought: 'who cares? This movie is not 100% serious anyway!'The original Tim Burton Batman was great as well but it was a bit cheesy at some parts and I didn't like all the actors. This movie improved on almost every aspect with a wonderful cast, a more Gothic style and no involvement of Prince. Nowadays, many fans of the Christopher Nolan movies dislike Burton claiming that the Nolan movies are more serious and therefore more loyal to the comics. I don't think this is entirely true: -There has never been an adaptation of the original concept of Batman which was a vengeful criminal killer with a gun. -Batman has taken many forms over the years peeking its silliness in the 60's (and a bit with Batman & Robin). A director is free to choose what kind of Batman he's going to portray as long if it's good.My opinion: Batman doesn't necessarily have to be serious. It's about a man in a rubber suit with pointy ears. Burton managed to create a perfect balance between the silliness and the darkness surrounding the whole idea.I just recently watched the Nolan movies and I love those ones as well (especially The Dark Knight). There's simply something about this movie that interests me more. Nolan's goal was to give the character much more depth and in doing so, he looked for an explanation of nearly every aspect of Batman. That's a bit too much for me, I'm a bigger fan of the more abstract version of Batman. The Burton movies are more theatrical and centered around the atmosphere.My conclusion is that you shouldn't compare the Nolan with the Burton movies. They're just different and it's up to you to decide which one you like better. My respect is for both directors.",Batman Returns
521,antetomasov,Tim Burton's work of art,9,18 March 2012,"Tim Burton is one of the most talented directors ever and this movie is a piece of art. It says things on many different levels, I will tell you what I read from it:Penguin is a character as disgusting on the inside as he is on the outside (he is evil but we feel for him because of his tragic past and maybe think he is not the one to blame or that he might have good in him (don't judge book by its covers). We are actually manipulated like the people of Gotham that bought into his sad story from the newspapers. Here is the statement about what power the media and appearances have over us. The truth of the matter is, penguin has no morality in him as he is truly selfish and wants only to satisfy his own needs. Those are revenge, power, lust, etc. while violating the rights of others, so the definition of what we call evil. Some would say these are animal like tendencies and animals are generally more oriented towards themselves rather than being altruistic. Penguin at the end actually denounces his humanity and claims he wants to be an animal (a penguin).But at the end before he dies, we feel sorry for him because he is suffering. He was a human being after all and we feel compassion for another human being. Not because he was good, but because he was - human just like us. And we understand him, his lust for power or just lust or revenge are emotions understandable to us humans and we can relate to that and so we feel sorry for a fellow human. And the actual penguins at the end...maybe there is more to animals than we humans give them credit for? Maybe they feel and know things we only think humans could feel or know?So the Penguin character represents more than one thing like: appearances are misguiding, humans and animals are not so different, and all that leads to us questioning our knowledge about this world of ours in general which leads us to admit how great mysteries of life are unknown to us.I also feel this movie establishes ""good"" and ""evil"" as actual forces of universe where Penquin abides by the laws of evil and Batman by the laws of good and so they clash in an inevitable battle. Because one Tim Burton's freak (Edward the Scissorhands) was good, but the other freak (Penguin)was evil. So being a freak has no actual say on whether you are good or evil, it is who you are inside that counts.I wouldn't do this movie justice without mentioning the title character, the Catwoman or Shreck or saying something about the music or the way Tim Burton tells the story visually by showing it in short scenes or frames where the music score follows perfectly - but now I did mention it. I feel this movie is a true work of art among Batman movies and among movies in general.",Batman Returns
522,mikeandhik,Burton and Keaton not only goes out with a bang but with style as well.,10,13 March 2003,"Tim Burton's Sequel to The original Batman is not only an improvement over its predecessor in so many levels but a dark study into human nature, and its refection on society. All the characters in this film are disturbed, and Burton pulls no punches when he shows their misgivings.  Michel Keaton's portrayal of the Dark Knight is a complex character study between Grief and Loneliness, while Michelle Pfeiffer's Portrayal of Catwoman walks the tight rope of female empowerment, and wounded sexual frustration. Danny Devito's Portrayal of The Penguin is a grotesque commination of wounded virtue and brutal animalistic urges that quite clearly puts this film as a whole in perspective in the question of duality. Each of these characters wants to be something that they are not, and in reality, can not hope to be.It's a very mature statement to make in a film like this, especially a super hero film to boot. That's what make Tim Burton's vision of Batman such a celebrated topic among the fans of these types of movies. Because of the levels of maturity that he weaves together in each of his two Batman films, and the experience of watching something more than just a cheap thrill.It's pretty sad that this was the last collaboration between Burton and Keaton on the character of Batman, because it would have been a joy to see the both of them take on more of the legacy of this legendary character and his world.  What's even worse is knowing the fact that the next two Batman movies are so bad, that they almost overshadow the good work Burton and Keaton did with the first two movie.",Batman Returns
523,jon6810,"Cyberpunk, meet German Expressionism",10,21 June 2007,"Raise your hand if you've ever heard the term ""German Expressionism."" If your hand is still timidly at your side, but you've seen this movie, put it in the erect position.Tim Burton returns to the age of silent movies and the spooky mise-en-scene of the likes of Dr. Caligari and Nosferatu (which starred the real, and naturally hideous, Max Schreck as the vampire) with his follow-up to the Academy Award winning Batman.German Expressionism is rather simple in theory, but takes a master to execute. Basically, it means that the scenery surrounding the story is not an accurate representation of what we would expect to see, but rather an extension of the attitudes and moods of the central characters. In this case, we get a abysmally dark and lifelike Gotham City. Burton intentionally mixed clashing architectural styles so that nothing seemed to make sense in his phantasmagorical world.Score composer Danny Elfman is also back and provides a soundtrack that feels more like an opera than simple movie music. He writes and edits his notes and dynamics so that they line up with everything, right down to the physical movement of the characters. For a crash-course in how to create a great film moment with music, pay special attention to the meltdown of Selina Kyle in her apartment.Just as with Jack Nicholson in the original film, the focus is again on the villain(s), not Batman himself. Some people, especially connoisseurs of the comic book series, seem to despise Burton's decision to do so. However, I find it captivating and mesmerizing when coupled with the almost-cyberpunk landscape in which the story unfolds. DeVito and Pfeiffer do well enough to carry this responsibility.However, this film does not ride on the coattails of its stars. Rather, Burton's imaginative genius and Elfman's haunting score create a world that I feel like I've visited in my dreams, though I know it exists only in the depths of a few creative minds.",Batman Returns

525,dr-ysv27,Nice Artwork but not intense,7,8 August 2012,"Hi all.....I am here to discuss you about this Tim Burton's batman.First of all it should be praised for its fine art work though its mostly comical and like a toy thing(after seeing Nolans series).I know it is unfair to compare these two as the time frames were different with obviously Nolan having a better advantage of technology and CGI.But the depth is some what not so intense in this Batman movie. One more applause to the person who wrote the dialogues.They are pretty good and catchy.Performance-wise I would say Pfeiffer stole the show followed by DeVito and lastly Keaton himself.I find him very incapacitated or unable to let out his expressions thus lacking dialogues.May be Bruce Wayne's character is such where his alter ego goes suppressed in terms of expressions. I am pretty interested in Batman movies after watching Nolan's series.So i cant rate this more than 7 as per character development,story depth and intensity.It is mostly comical at times with the characters mo-to not given so much depth.Wonder Y she transform's into cat-women after that fall sounds like she is mad. Christopher Walken deserves a special mention as his performance is shrewed,subtle and selfish.Highly capitalistic and manipulative.He is shown as a corporate giant who tries to use corporate style crime's for his benefit.

It i s sad and with lots of emotions, specially with the Pinguin's story. They say it has elements of S&M but I really don't find anything of that sort except for Catwoman's whip.This movie is deeper than its genre and villains aren't just some crazy freaks dressed like on a masquerade. They have strong motives with strong feelings involved. Catwoman (a great performance by Michelle Pfeifer!) isn't just a sexy chick who likes steeling jewels - she's on her personal crusade and Pinguin... well, by the end of the movie you really feel sorry for him (strong performance by Danny DeVito). Again, I think Michael Keaton is the best Batman and he carries his costume well.You can totally see that it is a Tim Burton movie, because he has an unusual style and is a very talented guy. But also the music is fantastic and fits the emotions.",Batman Returns
527,eeeeric123,Disturbingly Depressing.,5,14 May 2013,"Batman Returns was a major disappointment to me. When I saw the first Batman in this series, I loved it (mostly due to Jack Nicholson's performance as the Joker). The thing about these original Batman movies is that they put the majority of the focus on the villains. The Joker was a complete show maker in the last one, but this one includes Danny DeVito as the Penguin, and Michelle Pfeiffer as Cat Woman. While both actors did a good job, the two different stories of the Penguin and Cat Woman did not make a good combination. The Penguins story was depressing which added gloom to the story, and Cat Woman's story was disturbing which added darkness to the story. Put them together and you have a movie that's disturbingly depressing (or Depressingly Disturbing which ever you prefer.) Batman himself was played for the last time by Michael Keaton. A lot of people were mad when Keaton didn't return in the last two films for this series but personally I was OK with it. It's not that I think that he's a bad actor, as much as I think that he wasn't a convincing Batman (he doesn't look the part for starters). The rest of the acting was good. Particularly Christopher Walken as Max. He did a great job. I just don't think that a movie that doubles up on negative emotions is a good way to get buyers. And so thus, after one successful movie, the Batman franchise began to fail.",Batman Returns
528,bernardwarchal,An underrated holiday classic,8,1 October 2018,"Batman Returns is an underrated classic. Yes, it has its problems but for the most part it's a very entertaining film and a great follow-up to Batman (1989). Michael Keaton is still great as Batman the best in my opinion. He's intimidating yet not overly trying to be intimidating like Christian Bale. He also has a very charismatic performance as Bruce Wayne. He's suave yet cold from his tragic past. Danny Devito is terrifying as the penguin. His performance is uneasy to watch but in a good way. The penguins back story is very tragic and heartbreaking which adds great layers to his character and makes the audience feel a lot of sympathy for him. Michelle Pfeiffer is great as Catwoman. She really goes all in on the performance as someone whose gone crazy and is looking for revenge against the world. Her performance is probably my favorite in the whole film. You feel her pain of being lonely her whole life and her nearly dying has awoken this new woman to take on the world. Christopher Walken is great playing the maniacal businessman Max Shrek. You can tell he is having fun with his over the top performance. My favorite thing about this movie is the production design. Bo Welch created a very gothic and elaborate setting for the film. Everything from the buildings to the just the way people dress is just gothic and very old detective comic like. The zoo is my favorite set. I just love the giant polar bear in artic world. There's a giant crab. There's a duck car ride that looks like a ski lift. It just looks cool and thematic. The costumes are all great. The Penguin looks terrifying and is just unsettling to look at in a good way. Catwoman's suit is very accurate to the comics and fits the tone of the film. Max Shrek's outfits are all over top business suits that really look silly but in a way that works for his character and the tone of the film. The film is very comic book like. The set are straight from comic book drawings. The plot is very over the top and unrealistic, but it works but it sets up the universe in a way that just allows those things. The film is unapologetically an over the top Tim Burton comic book movie and that's why I love it.",Batman Returns
529,MercilessAssassin,Batman Returns - The definitive Psycho-Drama,10,29 March 2005,"This is my review of Batman Returns that I recently posted on the board for the film: It's easily the best Batman movie and one of the best things Burton's made, as well as clearly being focused on Batman whether you like the way it does this or not. It has a very interesting structure, and I love the way the main theme of masks is cleverly woven from the first frame onward through the characters and all plot points (the public facade and the reality underneath). It's a very thematically padded and interesting film, as well as being a great modern era ode to German Expressionist film-making in its ability to communicate ideas visually.As far as saying it's Burton and not Batman, that's utter rubbish. It's Burton's take on Batman, and that's no more or less valid than anybody else's as there is no definitive version of the character but only personal interpretation. If this was not the case, we would not have all these varying versions throughout the history of the character. I think Burton noted this himself when talking about adapting the material -- that comic book continuity was unsound and was constantly reinventing itself as far as the character. That seems to bother many purists (who, oddly, miss the point that the character has no single version to point to), but the freedom allowed Burton on this project is what makes it so special -- basically an artist given free reign, which I think should be applauded.Like it or hate it, it's a rare commercial blockbuster that is clearly and deeply personal, and that seems to really rankle many -- i.e. it's not a typical, safe comic book movie as far as template but is instead something more artistic and bizarre therefore it's *beep* I truly think the film gets a bad rep just for being a Batman movie in various circles even though it's a superior work by Mr. Burton.It's a great movie in my view and a great interpretation of Batman that in its runtime examines the character and makes definitive statements about him within its narrative outline, specifically in its final confrontations when considered with the rest of the film (both Batman/Penguin and Batman/Catwoman have personal duels at the end which give us payoff in regards to the psychology of the titular character). And as far as there not being enough Batman, he's in the film a lot after the first thirty five minutes or so which are clearly dedicated to building up the other characters with this being important to the structuring of the film inherently and to the examination of the Batman/Wayne character under that structure. After the first half hour, it's very Bats heavy in its content and intent.I think depression, though not delved into, was a part of it, if not the psychosis, as shown through their choice of origins for the character and the impetus for his nightly work. Obviously it was not delved into much at all beyond cause and effect, but it's easy to read that into it even within that surface context. As far as definitive interpretation? There is none, even when just considering Kane/Finger's era, which about says it all.For my tastes, I like the depressed, psychotic Batman Burton gave us and think it's a logical idea. Not definitive, but certainly as valid as any other. And Burton certainly did play up the original grim vigilante theme, right down to the killing, that Kane/Finger started with themselves -- on a purely aesthetic basis such as that (and considering the rather blank nature of the character in regards to psychology at this point, mood, overall action and look are about the only important things to translate from those earliest of stories which I think Burton did rather masterfully), it was more based on Batman's early beginnings than most other stuff when looking at its overall noir presentation as far as both mood and character.The Kane/Finger Batman, in simplest terms, was a lone vigilante that was soon revealed to be driven by the death of his parents --all of this can be said for Burton's Batman as well, with the main difference being that he was most interested in the psychology behind the actions of the main character (including the killing that is notably present in the two versions) rather than just the actions themselves as far as point a to point b narrative resolution.I think it's largely forgotten in many comic story lines that the underlying basis for Batman's nightly jaunts is psychological imbalance -- both as far as the depression and the heavily weird/illogical/psycho way he chooses to deal with that, by dressing up as a bat of all things. If you portray this on film and want it to be taken seriously at all, I think the point has to be made that this is not a psychologically healthy character at all, otherwise you get camp. If you don't deal with the central idea being a character that acts out in the manner he does because of lacking mental health in much the same way as the villains he encounters -- it's obvious, but sometimes forgotten, that the basis of so many of these characters stems from their psychological traumas, and that Batman's the same when you contrast underlying motivations.If Spider-Man's a soap, then Batman's a psycho-drama.",Batman Returns
530,Jes8884,"Batman returns, but does anyone care?",8,30 June 2005,"One word to sum up the sequel to the 250 million dollar grossing first film Batman, freak show. First lets look at the facts, Burton's odd casting choice I mean Pfeiffer is built for the slim kitty suit, but doesn't quite feel right as Catwoman. DeVito as the fat freak Peguin is no were near as cool as the Joker and there are much better villains to choose from in the Rouge's Gallery. Also I didn't like the trend of paring up two villains because one is enough to focus on. Keaton is the only saving grace of the film and the only person you care about in the movie. Burton almost makes the same movie again, but not as good or fun. At least Elfman's score soars and the themes match the mood of the characters. The one thing that made the movie even worse was that Gotham looked to Burtonish for me and felt like a sideshow and not a city of crime. I look at the movie like this, an art film with Batman in it.The first Batman was new and fresh while Returns has that been there done that feel. Where Spider-Man 2 topped the first one, Returns took the series one step back and for me one step back is to far.

531,erichwiese61,the return of the Batman is here,6,20 August 2013,"First of all, and I think you would agree, that the second movie off any film is not as good as the first one. With Batman returns this was the case. Not great, but still good. Keaton still makes a good batman. The bat suite was tampered with a little bit but it mostly looks the same. But yet again the story of how the villain became a villain was told. Not how batman was created. This time two villains had risen, the penguin and cat-woman. The penguin was a bit overdone for my liking, his huge nose, three fingers on each hand, funny shaped body and hi even living with penguins! Gosh I wonder what they were trying to say? Is he maybe half penguin? Still Danny deVito played it well. Catwoman is a bit far-fetched. She was really made from the likes of cats.not better than batman, but surely worth having a look",Batman Returns
532,MaverickMind,"Misguided, decent sequel to Batman",6,9 July 2005,"I can somewhat understand why this film is cherished so much. This film is the darkest installment of the Burton/Schumacher franchise. The movie has a star cast and Michelle Pfeiffer gives a memorable performance as exotic, seductive, but vile Catwoman. The great Danny Elfman music is all still there. Danny Devito and Christopher Walken bring decent comic relief in their roles as villains.The movie suffers from a silly plot devices and rhetoric , which is ironic considering this is supposedly the ""darkest, most serious"" film in the franchise. Yes, its dark, but in a very superficial, stylish way. The film never aroused in emotion of despair or sympathy for any of the characters because it was filled with ridiculous premises. There is more violence in this film, unnecessary death, even some minor blood, but especially near the end, the violent conflicts never seemed to have a point.The big problem with this movie is that its apparent Tim Burton wasn't sure where to take the character of Batman after the first film. Burton essentially focused on making fantastic Burtonized Gotham City and Burtonized villains. Whereas the first movie was somewhat realistic, gritty and a decent Batman film, this movie makes Gotham City more surreal and goth fairy-tail. Burton changes the origins and motivations of the two major villains (The Penguin and Catwoman) DRASTICALLY from their comic counterparts. The Penguin is changed from a deformed, calculating, crime boss into a genetically altered, naive, and angry mutant who lives in the sewers and never knew his parents (who are human). Catwoman's transformation and origin is almost as absurd. Their motivations are so dimensional, Catwoman is reduced to a simplistic poster boy for feminism.The first half of the movie has a decent plot, but after a semi-climax, the movie spins out of control wrecklessly and nothing makes much sense. For all the flack Batman & Robin got for being campy, this movie has the Penguin......talking to and commanding an army of penguins with rockets on their back. I couldn't believe I was seeing this in a what some considers ""the Best Batman movie of all time"". There are too many convenient plot devices and inconsistencies throughout the ending. The other minor characters from the first film are gone or do little to almost nothing in this film.Keaton's Batman is still good and convincing. What's bad though is that the film is even less about Batman waging a war on crime than the previous film, and more about angry, unloved, or ugly people (the hero and the villains) never finding happiness or love that they deserve. Burton definitely imprinted his artistic, fantastic, Gothic but dreary style throughout this film, for better or worse. Thus, this isn't really a superhero film, but a typical Gothic ""nobody loves me, so I have to wreck havoc"" film. Batman's dedication to fighting crime is ambiguous in this movie and I don't feel he becomes a stronger or a resolute character in the end.The movie is decent, there are some good action scenes, and as said before Pfieffer is awesome and attractive in this film. Christopher Walken is sometimes funny and Danny Devito has some good scenes. I think the dark nature of the movie has successfully hid the fact that this movie is just as campy and silly as the next two sequels. In some aspects, Batman Forever is even better at somethings, such as characterizing Bruce Wayne. This film has little to no direction, point, and is more stylized art over substance.",Batman Returns

534,agustin11,The Most Wicked 'Batman' To Date,9,22 October 2008,"What happens when you give a director virtually every freedom possible when making a big blockbuster sequel? Well, if you are Warner Bros. and are working with Tim Burton, ""Batman Returns"" is what you get. Lots of things can be said for this movie. Naysayers could say it's too graphic, dark, depressing and flat-out mean. However, those who appreciate the dark-side of the Dark Knight should appreciate this entry in the franchise. Perhaps I was a little too young to be watching this movie in 1992, but yet, I was still intrigued. I could not look away, almost as if my favorite superhero was in a horror movie. Now, you should note that ""Batman Returns"" is not for everyone. If you thought Burton's original ""Batman"" was dark and scary, this one might put you over the edge. Little kids, in general, really should not be watching this, which is ironic considering all the action figures this movie spewed forth. In this movie, Bruce Wayne (with Michael Keaton reprising his role) is pitted against the sewer-dwelling Penguin (portrayed spot-on by Danny Devito), falls for Selina Kyle/Catwoman (Michelle Pfeiffer) and deals with a devious megalomaniac in Max Shreck (Christopher Walken). If Batman doesn't have trouble while he's at work, he at least has enough emotional troubles to deal with at home. ""Batman Returns"" is really quite a complex and dense movie. On one hand, it is a big summer blockbuster, and a sequel. On the other hand, it is a bit of a psychological thriller that really pokes into the Batman/Bruce Wayne psyche. Everything about this film evokes a certain mood -- from the Christmas-time setting, the grey skies and snow, too Penguin's gloomy lair and Selina Kyle's dumpy bachelorette-pad. It's almost too well made. ""Batman Returns"" surely isn't an everyday movie. Personally, I find I have to be in a certain mood to appreciate it. Which is simply why the movie didn't make the intended splash at the box office and why many critics panned it. Regardless, it is still a Batman movie, and in my opinion, still stays true to the character. If there's any fault, it's that it's too risky for it's own good.

537,Cold_In_Space,The dark fantasy Batman,9,28 December 2015,"The sequel to ""Batman"" (1989) is just as dark and gritty and has a greater premise: once again Batman (Michael Keaton) is called for to defend Gotham, but this time: His main enemy, Penguin (Danny DeVito) is not simply a homicidal maniac, but also character who apparently desires to be accepted into society, while secretly leading a group of outcast villains, the Red Triangle Circus,and with a plan for revenge on the city in mind; Into play then comes a very special woman with whom he will fall in love with as well as try to stop, Catwoman (Michelle Pfeiffer), and a corrupt and powerful and ruthless businessman, Max Shreck (Christopher Walken), who is tied to both other villains.Returning from the first movie aside from Keaton are Michael Gough as Alfred Pennyworth and Pat Hingle as Commissioner Gordon.The characters all have a Burton-like twist to them and are still not very far away from other versions, looking closely.The main four actors (Keaton, DeVito, Pffeifer and Walken)'performances lead up to a great climax and the characters' destinies will have the film end on a bittersweet note for our hero.All this with a dark Christmas atmosphere, fantasy visuals and familiar soundtrack, and a cold beauty queen in Cristi Conaway's Ice Princess, too.Mistletoe can be deadly if you eat it.

The strength of Batman-movies has been always the villain characters and this one is the best.

And the psychotic relationship between Selina/Catwoman and Bruce/Batman might be the most beautiful love-story ever shown on the screen.I strongly recommend. This just isn't an action movie.

It's also the most misunderstood.  Tim Burton created a dark masterpiece that everyone hated when it came out, just because it was so different from the first.  Instead of just being entertainment, this movie actually tries be a MOVIE in the classiest sense of the word.  It speaks about love, death, family and the human condition. This is the only film in the series that actually needed two villains. Catwoman really isn't a villain, and Penguin doesn't have enough ""charisma"" too hold the entire movie.  Many people say there isn't enough Batman in it, but that is missing the point.  It's not about Batman, it's about Gotham City, hell, heaven, and purgatory all mixed in one, and in effect a metaphor for the human condition. When Wayne realizes who Selina is, it is one of the most memorable moments of film.  This moment is equaled later with Selina's ""can't live with myself"" speech.

Batman is yet again just a secondary character to the villains, getting as much time as The Scarecrow did in Batman Begins. In this movie, dumb-witted Tim Burton re-designed the Penguin. He portrayed him very simular to the villain Killer Croc. The Penguin, instead of being a Rich, snobby Nightclub and casino owner, who often supplies Batman with information was turned into a sewer mutant freak puking black and white mucus from his mouth, with feces on his pajamas. Raised and learned English grammar by a bunch of NAZI marching penguins with rocket launchers on their backs who tries running for mayor. While Selina Kyle is pushed out of a window, killed brought back to life by a bunch of cats trying to eat her and becomes Catwoman. But in the comics Catwoman is an ally. Just a sneeky thief. Burton portrayed her as a terrorist. Blowing up buildings and killing everyone in her path.

543,spidermanfan3377,A fave,10,4 June 2002,"First let me start off by saying that without a doubt anyone who does not like this movie must be a. a ten year old,b. a comic book geek, or c. a person of a similar mindset. Sorry kids, this movie is not 100% silly cornball, comic book hokum, the heroes are all too recognizably human ( as opposed to bland specimens of almost God-like perfection that will fill your head with warm memories of the crudely drawn crap you used to watch  a billion saturday mornings ago ), and so are the villains. As much as I enjoyed Spiderman ( I'm a big fan of the comics), I have no problems admitting it was typical, by the numbers Hollywood product that while extremely enjoyable on a puerile level,it doesn't engage on any other(beer guzzling, lets shoot the sh*t over pool fellas just outta college who-you know- just EAT up this crap will inevitably ask ""Well, f**k, what else do you want from a movie?"" Such people truly are holdovers from the Ice Age, and merit no attention). This movie's strength lies in its sharply drawn characters as opposed to its special effects which is why it will outlive such inoffensive, whiz bang offerings. Take the Supermans: by now, they are quite dated, as is the first Batman movie, and as Spiderman will unquestionably be in a few years, but this movie is as fresh now as it was in '92. Unfortunately, Batman Returns was a happy accident that will never occur again in the history of Superhero films. Warner's ( inadvertently of course) made a smart decision in handing over total creative control to established money maker Burton(a genuine artist with a definite vision; notice the refreshing lack of blatant product placement, or say, stupid flavor of the month pop soundtrack tie ins calculated to make teenyboppers go gaga in perfect, herd-like unison as we all know they do).  The result is a wonderful family film that contains S and M images, coarse sexual innuedo, and sizable dollops of bloody onscreen violence that will no doubt  scar younger viewers. It's an over the top subversion of the genre, that knows its taking a dump on the notion of Superhero films as school field trip fodder. and is completely unrepentant. Which why its so f******g great. None of it would work of course, if the acting was on the same low level as other comic book films, but thankfully the cast-much to the chagrin of the unwashed masses- chooses infuse their roles with depth.  Michelle Phieffer in particular is a stand out as the tormented Selina, and her sexilicious alter ego the Catwoman. Keaton as Bruce Wayne is a revelation.

However, Batman Returns just feels superior In many ways. Michael Keaton played the dual role of Batman/Bruce Wayne to perfection, a much improved performance to the original Batman. Danny DeVito was awesome as the Penguin, probably more grotesque and sinister than his comic book incarnation. Then there's Michelle Pfeiffer as the sultry Catwoman, what more can you say? She completely embodied the character and took it to new limits.The technology in this film was much cooler and interesting. A new and improved Batmobile, the sleek Batmissile, and the all terrain Batskiboat were all used well in this movie.

They do still have Michael Keaton, who happens to be the best Batman compared to Val Kilmer and George Clooney. I thought that this was perfectly cast. Danny DeVito is great at portraying a dark side of the penguin character. The reason I love Tim Burton for directing these movies is he is showing a dark side of the Batman series, and of the villains. Michelle Pfeiffer is great at playing two roles as a stressed business woman and a feline-fanatic villain. The story of this movie was definitely well written. I almost forgot to mention Christopher Walken.

When I watched the beginning, I thought that this would be an awesome movie. I was wrong. The ending was stupid. Batman ripped off his mask and exposed his true identity to Max Shrek. Batman would never do that. The reason why he wears his cowl is to keep his identity a secret. When I saw him rip it off, it ruined the whole movie for me. If he had only ripped it off in front of Catwoman, that wouldn't have been bad because she had already learned his true identity. When I bought this movie on VHS at Wal-mart, I had a feeling that Batman would lose his mask in it. But I had no idea that they'd be so stupid as to make him take it off himself.

As a child growing up, catwoman was an icon for me and Pfeiffer's portrayal was remarkable. Even now, as i am older, the performance still holds up as one of my favorite performances of all time. She didn't just portray one character to perfection but played three. It's remarkable that she can meld all three sides of Selina Kyle together so perfectly. That being said, I enjoyed the film thoroughly. It was much more Gothic and surreal than any other Batman film. I think some scenes may be a little ""frightening"" for younger kids though, such as the scene where Penguin bites the reporter's nose or when catwoman falls into the greenhouse and starts to scream. I thought Danny Devito did a good job, and Keaton did what the role called for. I especially enjoyed Christopher Walken's Max Shreck. Well I love anything that man does, he's just a howling good time. But back to catwoman. She was just gorgeous, crazed, sexy and stunning. Her whip-cracking, her black eye shadow and pale skin, and her vinyl suit are a perfect combo. Her lunacy makes her all the more sexy.

I'v noticed that some reviewers on here don't see much point in having Christopher Walken's character, but i liked his performance and he was good alongside the Penguin. Also it was good to see the character of Alfred being extended and seeing him help Batman when Batman was going through the sewer towards the Penguin's hideout.All in all, another fine job by Burton and the cast makes for an enjoyable second Batman movie. It gets a vote of 8 from me.",Batman Returns
551,aliases,The real Batman,9,23 October 2015,"Remember when Batman And Gotham were truly dark? When villains were gruesome and not only sexy and cool? Tim Burton's Batman was the pure version of how it is supposed to be, and it makes me sad that people who grow up watching Nolan's films will always think Catwoman is such a nice lady who marries Batman in the end, and that Bruce Wane is this atrocious version of a spoiled rich kid with toys, stripping Batman's legacy of its darkness and appeal. Michelle Pfiffer in this film gave a masterful performance, along with Danny Devito. Tim Burton provides us with such a dark version of the city so that we can inhale its dense air and feel the sadness of the lonely individuals which take part in this story of angry, sad villains who have a storyline, and the loneliness of the man that is Batman, things that were terribly missed with all the other versions of Batman films. This film was a masterpiece then, and still reigns the darkest realm of all, Gotham city.",Batman Returns

It made me laugh, but mostly because it was so ridiculous and stupid. It was good entertainment, but as a movie it's pretty bad andWithout company it will probably get pretty boring 'cause it's so damn long.

553,adamjackson-91071,On par with Batman '89.,10,23 March 2018,"Hot off the heels off his hugely successful predecessor, Tim Burton was quickly snapped up to harness the reigns to it's sequel. But only if he had total control. Which as this film shows, he most certainly got.
Visually different, (I miss Anton Furst's lavish sets, though the sets created here are still worthy of merit), the film doesn't really seem to be in the same universe as the first film, whereas the first one was a straight up good vs evil superhero crime flick, this one lingers more on fantasy and a freak show element that fully embodies Tim Burton's creative talent. I feel that if the viewer isn't a fan of Burton, or felt disappointed with Batman '89, probably won't appreciate 'Returns, although it's definitely worth a watch, the film seems to almost play out like an opera.
Keaton returns also as Batman, albeit I feel not quite giving such a strong performance as he did in the first one, despite getting more screen time. Although he doesn't give a bad performance by any means, he does seem to just simply breeze through the film. 
Danny DeVito is the next star to portray one of Batman's rogues, The Penguin. He couldn't be any more different from every incarnation of the character before it, instead adopting shades of Killer Croc's origin. He is grotesque, tragic, a freak with the worst case of sexual frustration arguably in existence, he is a Tim Burton creation with the Penguin moniker pinned to him. I like this incarnation however, it fits in perfectly with the themes Burton is trying to convey. Whether he comes across as a strong villain though is up for debate. There's potential, but the plot involving him running for Mayor I feel instead could've taken a different route, focusing more on his bitterness and hatred more directly, allowing us to see just how twisted his mind has become because of his very unfortunate circumstances, clearly painting the picture of the old school horror villains that Burton clearly has been inspired by. 
Which he references head on with the casting of Christopher Walken as Max Shreck, a corrupt businessman with plans to drain the city of power for his own benefit, using Penguin as means in the process. Although he is played well by the ever reliable Walken, he also doesn't really feel like a strong villain, although he is at least a ""real"" villain. You can see at certain points where this character was originally supposed to be a return for Harvey Dent, which had they kept could've been quite effective, showing how Dent is leaning towards villainy because of circumstance before he actually succumbs to his Two Face persona. Could've made the ending to the film pack more punch too, pernaps even bettering the third entry in this franchise...
Michelle Pfeiffer's Catwoman is also vastly different to the source material, no longer an agile jewel thief, she is a supernatural, tragic character who befriends Bruce Wayne, while their alter egos clash. I like how their romance plays out in the film, it never feels forced, and the contrasts between themselves and their other halves proves to be quite effective. Some still insist she IS Catwoman, and sometimes it's hard to argue against it.
The film is greatly boosted by the return of Danny Elfman, who brings back his bombastic Batman theme, as well as creating beautiful themes and riffs for Penguin and Catwoman. Elfman's contributions lift this film far higher than it ever would be without him, giving the film a grandiose feel, and further reinforcing the ""opera"" feel the film has throughout. 
Despite having more flaws than its predecessor in my opinion, the good vastly outweighs the bad, making this film at least on par with Batman '89, but not better. Being a Tim Burton fan greatly helps the appreciation of this film, but I can see how even a fan could find difficultly enjoying this as a Batman film. I however find this incredibly easy. And will return to this film time and time again.",Batman Returns
554,Guitarz,"The gothic adventure continues with a twisted, darker tone",9,20 September 1998,"Tim Burton's BATMAN RETURNS is by far one of the best sequels ever spawned. Burton chose not to follow the norm, making Batman Returns stand on its own. That is the best quality of this movie; you didn't have to see the first one to understand this film.  Michael Keaton does an excellent job of reprising the role of the Dark Knight.  In some ways I think he out-did his first performance in Batman.  (Ex. The scene where he sits in the dark, alone in his chambers and the bat-signal comes shinging through the window.) Michelle Pfeiffer as the Catwoman had to be one of the best casting choices as well.  If this had been a terrible movie, the chemistry between Keaton & Pfeiffer would make it worth the watch.  Danny DeVito's dark & repulsive portrayal of the Penguin was also a masterpiece.  Critics raved that this film was ""too dark"", but in the true sense of Batman it was exactly as it should be.  Gets 4 outta 5 stars from me.",Batman Returns

In my opinion, this is probably the most underrated and ignored bat-film to date - perhaps being surrounded by the original Batman (which, while a worthy film, doesn't truly give us the dark angle), and the two sequels which were a circus act.'Returns also has the best music I've heard in a bat-film yet (yes, even above TDK's). The only reason it gets a 9/10 instead of a 10/10 is the far-stretched Penguin story, and a lack of action awesomeness I wanted from a fictional film. I wanted gadgets, jumps, leaps, martial arts, etc. This film raises expectations with some sequences, and the action just stops abruptly with an anti-climax.",Batman Returns

560,MottheMoses,Burton versus Batman,9,2 March 2008,"Tim Burton is in essence an expressionist film-maker, disinterested in dimensions of character and obsessed with Gothic scope, opting for style over substance incessantly throughout his career. However, with his style being so poignantly endearing, I, like many moviegoers, forgive all the countless flaws that can be found in many of his movies and become engrossed in what are essentially, one hundred million dollar art films.It's almost embarrassing for me to see a poetic, emotionally involving spirit within the second installment of a mediocre franchise, especially when that franchises target audience are half-witted 15 year old boys. Batman Returns should have been every bit as commercial as its predecessor, ensuring box office draw and cheap (in actual fact, very expensive) thrills, being entertaining without ever truly involving its audience. Had this been the result, then Tim Burton would have surely been required to direct a third installment. Instead, Burton delivers something that can only truly be defined by the phrase, 'out there'.From the melancholy opening in which a high society couple throw a prison-like bassinette containing their newly born deformed baby into a river, it is clear that Batman Returns, ain't no picnic at Buckingham Palace. Cut to thirty three years later, during a political speech made by bad guy business tycoon Max Shreck (sinisterly portrayed by Christopher Walken), the Red Triangle Circus Gang attack Gotham City. Batman (Michael Keaton returning to the role) makes his first appearance sporting a new logo, eventually saving the day. Shreck is soon kidnapped by the circus gang and black-mailed into endorsing the political return of the baby, now a fully grown Penguin man (Danny DeVito in hideously perfect make-up), whose motives for return are suspicious only to Batman.Meanwhile, Shreck attempts to off his nosey and awkward assistant Selina Kyle (played perfectly by Michelle Pfeiffer who quite frankly deserved more recognition for her performance) who transforms into the deliciously sexy and psychotic Catwoman, out for revenge and harbours, for some unexplained reason, a deadly vendetta against the Dark Knight.Batman Returns is bleak. The production design is breathtaking, delivering a cold haunting Gotham City with an even more apocalyptic feel than its predecessor. Danny Elfman's score supports the film brilliantly, ranging from invigorating to tragic. The tone and direction of the whole film itself is intensely brooding, shot like a sad nightmare, Burton's direction overshadows what is in fairness a diabolical screenplay with an almost totally irrelevant plot and yet at the same time perfect for Burton's visual style of film-making. And whilst Burton's action sequences struggle for exhilaration, the real excitement lies in the directional choices displaying the fall of each of its main characters, the Penguins demise, the Catwoman's mental state and Bruce Wayne's lonely destiny.Warner Brothers hated it whilst critical and audience reaction was mixed. After all, they wanted a Batman sequel, not a weird, somewhat ghastly horror movie, in which a deformed psychopathic orphan attempts to kidnap and drown a batch of babies, all-the-while vomiting what can only be described as green mucus. The production company wanted an audience friendly feature, something for the McDonald's clan to promote their happy meals with, not a movie of dire irredeemable characters, including a sexually repressed secretary who is pushed from a skyscraper and revived by a gang of cats awakening her from unconsciousness by chewing on her bloodied ice cold fingers.It's easy to understand the mass disappointment that followed the release of Batman Returns. The film never felt like a Batman blockbuster. It is questionable if Burton really knew who Batman actually was or even if he cared about the character as much as he cared about the film fitting in with his usual themes of beautifully haunting art direction and misinterpreted, lonely characters who rarely conform with societies standards and expectations. This is why Burton failed to create a great Batman film. He did however; create a nostalgic and stunning, ballsy piece of cinema that remains a personal and nostalgic favourite of mine.This may not be a great Batman movie. But it is a great Tim Burton film.",Batman Returns
561,aliggrunt,The best of all the batman films. Flawed like all but never fails to deliver,8,13 May 2008,"what can i say, this film is amazing. it has its flaws like every film does for example wobbly headstones in a graveyard, a clearly visible slide board during the penguins death scene, Max Shreck losing his heavy coat in a split second between shots during the image consultancy scene, batman losing his black eye makeup all of a sudden between shots so he can reveal Bruce Wayne to Catwoman, dialogue being recorded but is played back and spoken differently than when it was spoken in the first place and lastly Catwoman all of a sudden knows how to use a bull whip without any training whatsoever. these flaws are minor compared to some you would see in for example batman forever where the riddler can obviously be seen waiting for his cue or val Kilmer's hair changing between shots.what makes this film so deserving of an 8/10 is the great acting because the performances are absolutely amazing. Michael Keaton reprises his role as Batman and has a lot more to do in this film. He looks more comfortable in the role the second time around and is on par with the villains performances. Danny Devito is the perfect penguin. I really like the conversion of the penguin into the grotesque penguin man instead of the non threatening character from the comics or TV show because now the character has more depth and has a far more interesting story that generates from the basic need of family and to feel accepted and wanted. this gives us an evil character who we feel sympathy for because he was rejected for being what he is which is not his fault. Michelle Pfeiffer is excellent as Catwoman. she is sleet and sexy and she is also a villain we can feel sorry for because of the way she is victimised. Christopher Walken is a great secondary villain and is so interesting a character even though he is not even in the batman universe.the soundtrack is far better than the first and Danny Elfman gets more of a chance to show off his musical talents this time around. The sets are amazing. They are detailed, eye catching, sinister, Gothic , unique, dark and so many other adjectives can describe how amazing they look. the costumes and make up are great and obviously a lot of work went into making them and all the work pays off because the Batsuit is better, the cat suit is amazing to look at and the penguin make up and effects are so convincing.The animatronic penguins look really realistic and are played to good effect. The script is really good and the Storyline in my opinion is a plausible one. overall, because of all these factors this film deserves an 8/10 and stands as my favourite of all the batman films",Batman Returns

The whole scenery of Gotham City, the special effects, the costumes, etc. Everything was exactly where it should have been. Dark and Gothic, this film was perfect for the Batman franchise. Michael Keaton's portrayal of the Dark Knight was once again great! Michelle Pfeiffer's portrayal of Catwoman in my opinion was PERFECT!! She brought a dangerous yet sexy element to this character, a performance that would be very hard for a different actress to pull off.

The third and fourth were terrible, too, but the third was better than the first. Joel Schumaker made it like the TV show. Very corny acting and put Robin in it. I hated Robin in the third and fourth.I rated this Batman an 8 over 10. This had the most action and the best Batman actor. Micheal Keaton kicked ass! Val Kilmer wasn't bad. George Clooney. Tisk tisk. Pitiful. He sucked ass!!! I don't like the Penguin. My fave. villain is Mr. Freeze. Catwoman is weird. She was sexy in the movie though. She and Poison Ivy were two sexy and HOT girl villains.So, in conclusion, I liked this Batman the all-time best out of the four.

564,zacharywilhite,The Best BatmanMovie EVER,10,30 August 2008,"I'm an enormous comic book geek, and I've aways had a fascination for the darker comic book characters like Spawn, The Spectre, Deadman, and Batman. My favorite visual manifestations of the dark knight always lean towards the dark and exaggerated work of Kelley Jones, Sam Keth, Norm Breyfogle, or Ted McKeever. Tim Burton's Batman films (espescially this one) are the closest of the 6 Batman movies to capture this aspect. Unlike The Dark Knight(in which Heath Leger doesn't steal the show, he IS the show), the best performance in the whole film is Micheal Keaton's incredible Batman/Bruce Wayne. He really nails it as the caped crusader. From the subtle humor of Bruce Wayne to the dark brooding as Batman.But the supporting cast is excellent. Danny DeVito is absolutely brilliant as the Penguin. The film's portrayal isn't exactly true to the comics, but the Penguin is usually pretty lame with a bad origin and the Burton update is much more fascinating than to ridiculous comics version. As for Catwoman, sexy has a new name. Michelle is spellbinding as the Catwoman and I positively love that costume.When I draw Catwoman, she's always in a costume similar to the one in this film. The shiny leather and stitches are way cooler than the purple spandex in the comics. Also note the Batmobile, by far the best Batmobile ever. I love how much style Burton brings to the movie. The villains(DeVito,Pfeiffer,and Walken) all have a silent movie quality to them which is great. The Gotham City in the film is way more stylish and original than the other films.Danny Elfman's score is incredible and the costumes are some of the best I've ever seen. If you're a Tim Burton fan, see it. It really is one of his best. If your Batman fan, see it. As I've already said it's the best Batman yet.",Batman Returns
565,mrmarkgrant,Style Over Substance,6,12 April 2010,"The first Tim Burton Batman (1989) movie was VERY good. I enjoyed that film. This movie is VERY fun and VERY enjoyable. With a stellar cast that includes Michael Keaton, Danny DeVito, Michelle Pffiefer, Christopher Walken and many others, one would expect the brilliance and excitement of the first film doubled. However, that just doesn't happen in this sequel. There are some great performances in the movie, but basically there are just too many villains intertwined with each other's movements. It gets tiring to watch with too many great actors getting their faces plastered all over the screen all at once. It feels almost like a competition at times. The scenery is fantastic and there are some amazing special effects but the storyline is watery and tiresome. It is simply not original enough to be an exceptionally good film. Batman has some great new gadgets which will entertain and thrill younger movie-goers and the characters are extremely savouring to watch but I couldn't help thinking that Tim Burton knew this was going to be his last Batman movie for warner Bros and therefore decided to jam all his ideas into a Gothic and somewhat suffocating two hours.

567,funanyeah,"A Dark, screaming Mayhem !",4,10 January 2016,"I liked Tim Burton's style. It's dark, funny and his characters have a certain charming quality about them. Yet, 89 minutes into Batman Returns and I'm having serious second thoughts.May be because this is not something we've come to associate with Batman or may be it's the effect of Nolan's masterpieces, Batman Returns simply doesn't work for me. Instead of characters, we're bombarded with ghastly caricatures. Story resembles an out-of- control bandwagon and the sets are outlandish. It might come out as a dark work of art to some but for all it's managed to give me is a mind- boggling headache.Danny Devito had potential but he's been reduced to a whiny, childish mess. For Michelle Pfeiffer, i've just one word - Terrible. Not that I would associate Catwoman with colorful wondergirl stuff but in fleshing out her character to remember the feline fiend, the writers seem to have gone a mile ahead of overboard. Right from the costume, makeup to the portrayal of the character, every single thing is just nuisance. Christopher Walken's Max Shreck seems a confused soul rather than the shrewd businessman he's supposed to be. Bruce & Alfred try to save Gotham in the midst of all this grotesqueness, just as Michael Keaton & Gough try to save Batman Returns from becoming a complete mess. The movie simply did not work for me.",Batman Returns
568,aralle,The Dark Knight's Opus,10,25 March 2005,"""Batman Returns"" is not a perfect film in the empirical sense of the word: there really is not quite enough Batman presence, some of the fight scenes (particularly with Catwoman) don't make sense, and some of the plot points are a bit more fantasy than reality (albeit that's probably intentional). But a mathematical stacking of pros and cons is not what makes a film great or horrible, it's the impact of it and the merit of its artistry. In this respect, Batman Returns is a masterpiece.Tim Burton's major contribution to Batman in general, despite his frustrating insistence on being fascinated with the villains, is giving him back, and refining, his dark nature. Burton, along with Frank Miller's Dark Knight Returns (graphic novel) and a few others, re-imagined Batman into the Dark Knight, perfecting him into the somewhat frightening crime fighter Bob Kane was getting at back in 1939. ""Dark"" characters are often created by piling on violence, sex, or drug use, but Batman needs none of that to be scary. In fact he's better without it. He's dark because that's what he is, and there's a purity to it that no other super-hero can touch. Tim Burton pioneered this image of him in ""Batman,"" then mastered in ""Returns.""""Batman Returns"" centers around four characters: Batman, Catwoman, The Penguin and Max Shreck. These four principles are the force of this movie, and the film's plot serves as an elaborate character study of each of them. Every one of them is both friend and enemy of each other character at different points of the movie, until the conflict between them throws the plot into a frenzy of senseless mayhem at the conclusion, finally succumbing to the insanity of its principles. For this reason, the ebb and flow of the plot is a bit off-kilter, and that would be a problem if any of those four performances weren't absolutely fabulous. Describing someone's acting never does it any justice, so I won't try to get into details, but it should be noted that all four of them spar with each other at full power.The Batmobile is back and still kicking, and Burton and company thought of some great ways of tinkering with their toy, none of which I will reveal now. Suffice to say the Batmobile offers up some of the grandest entertainment in the film, involving chase sequences that stand up to this day due to the sheer cleverness of the situation. The Dark Knight's suit is more regal in this one, slightly grayed, taller and less compacted. Batman looks something like a king in his outfit. As for Michael Keaton, he proves yet again why Bob Kane gave him the nod for the role in 1989. It doesn't matter that the man is not all physically imposing, because that face of his looks so terrifying and dark in the Cowl that his presence is magnified two times over. Keaton's rasp is still on point, able to transform his body language and his voice perfectly under the suit. It should also be noted that Burton's Batman is quieter than anyone else's, including Frank Miller's. I love that. Batman is always too chatty everywhere else. As for Catwoman, Batman Returns perfected her. There is no reason to ever do Catwoman again in any work of fiction, because you will never again create a character so fascinating, sympathetic or more tragic. Burton took a nothing character, some one- dimensional sultry cat-burglar, and made her a vicious look at sexism and the persecution of innocence in an ugly, cruel world. Well done.Danny deVito's Penguin is horribly ugly, completely hate-able, and rather pathetic, which is exactly what they were going for. He's a twisted animal with twice the anger and half the brains, not able to compete with Batman on any real level. But enter Max Shreck, a political monster whom the Penguin happens to have some dirt on, and The Penguin becomes a hand-puppet for Shreck, almost like Max testing to see if he could really make this abomination lovable. He has a mayor in office that doesn't always play ball, so he uses this thing to win the hearts of a Gotham City that is so desperate for hope they will latch onto anything. It's a cruel spectacle executed beautifully, and both actors give amazing turns. deVito will never get the credit he deserves for the film, because he makes you hate him so sincerely you forget to stop hating him when the credits roll. Christopher Walken is chilling, hateful and...(please don't ask me how he did this)...sympathetic. It's impossible to understand, but Walken somehow played Shreck so purely that it's hard not to respect him, even though he is a truly corrupt, twisted creature of a man.The plot is imperfect, some of the fights are odd, and the plot is as much fantasy as that's possible in a movie set in a city, but it doesn't matter. Four fascinating, complicated characters are set into a boxing ring and told to go at it, and Batman Returns is the result. Not to mention the whole film is anchored by one of the most famous superheros of all time. It's a shame Batman gets upstaged by Burton's fascination with The Penguin, but it's a forgivable mistake in a story that's so deeply affecting, and so dark. That's the key thing Returns has that the original kind of missed: the soul.",Batman Returns

This film beautifully melds storylines in a way that are both dark and captivating, while also having a campy, comic element that few films are able to achieve. Michael Keaton as Batman is the absolute best, as he is believable as our tortured hero, and Michelle Pfieffer as Catwoman?? Who wouldn't love this film?!? Danny Devito as Penguin Man is both disturbing and believable, and you can't help but empathize with him as his story develops. I remember watching this movie as a kid and being intrigued by the character development and being both terrified of and sad about Penguin Man's storyline...I recall being drawn into the story...I still think that Oswald's intentions were pure at first when he was seeking out his parents, but I digress.No film Is without it's flaws, but if you're looking for a fun, campy, well acted yet disturbing rendition of Batman and the villains of Gotham, this is the film for you.

Whereas in the first film, Batman felt a bit overshadowed by the campy Joker character, but now Batman has up to three adversaries that you care more about than the title star. Catwoman, a revenge seeking feline imitator. The Penguin, a criminal who was actually raised by penguins. And Max Shreck... And that is it. Sometimes I felt myself actually rooting for Catwoman to kick the snot out of Batman and just due the guy in because Bruce Wayne felt so unimaginative and boring. Which isn't good being as though Tim Burton has the imagination of a hawk's eye and got too wrapped in the visuals of the film. Looking like Gotham is one thing, but feeling like Gotham is another. Tim Burton's direction is not very inventive, although he does seem to know where to go and who to focus on in any given moment. Danny Elfman's score was (of course) the best part of the entire film minus Michelle Pfeiffer's performance as the sexy Catwoman. So what do we have?

Many have complained that these older Batman films took a different approach towards the caped crusader and his adventures. However, that does not mean that these movies could not be enjoyed. Batman Returns works both as a sequel to the first Tim Burton directed Batman while also working as a stand-alone. There is 1 or 2 references to the 89' Batman but you basically you could have missed the first Batman and watched this without feeling that something was missing. This movie is much more darker than the 89' one, Gotham City is a very uncomfortable looking city and feels as if danger hides behind each corner and I think this adds to the story. It pulls us into its world as we are introduced to what I felt was a very good performance from DeVito as the crazed Penguin who almost felt similar to Nicholson's Joker, with the differences being his back-story (which is somewhat explained) and his goals. Michelle Pfeiffer also gave a good performance as a menacing Catwoman who throws herself into the Penguin's plans to rise up the ranks of Gotham with very evil intentions which are slowly revealed as the movie progresses. Keaton also gave what I felt was a deeper performance as Batman, he made it feel as if he too was worried about the possible outcomes from Penguin and his intentions.""Eat floor."" -Batman (Batman Returns)",Batman Returns

579,bestgoalieintheworld,An amazing creepy sequel,10,10 January 2006,"If you thought there should have been more Tim Burton style in the first Batman, this has a ton of it. With an all star cast of Michel Keaton portraying batman again perfectly, Michelle Pfiffer as a superb cat woman (much better than the mediocer Halle Berry character), a great creepy performance by Danny Devito, and the great Christooher Walken playing the evil Max Shreck. The story is about two villains. One a seductive secretary dressed up as a cat, and a ghoulish mutant penguin who lives in the sewers of Gotham City. The penguins plan is to become the mayor of Gotham and start some evil plans. The citizens of Gotham feel sorry for the penguin and ignore that he could be dangerous, except for Batman. Catwoman is a weird villain. In fact you don't know if she is a hero or a villain. She blows up a mall but saves a woman from getting mugged. When cat woman and the penguin team up there plan is to frame batman and take over the city. As much as the first Batman is great, I think that this one is a bit better.",Batman Returns
580,nvmoviefan,One of the greatest movies ever!,9,31 December 2006,"This is definitely one of the best movies ever! I wish Burton had directed the next Batman movies instead of Schumacher, because Batman Returns is not ridiculously shallow or campy like the Schumacher Batman films (though Batman Forever was somewhat okay).The strength of the movie comes from the characters' psychological depth, Danny Elfman's music,and the visual look and atmosphere of the movie. All the actors were BRILLIANT; they did a really wonderful job and should have received Oscar and awards and stuff. However, at times, it seems that the plot line is not exactly consistent. For example, Max Shreck wants to drain the energy from Gotham City, but this is not given much attention to later in the movie. Fortunately, this did not in any way ruin the movie for me.The Penguin was rejected by his parents and thrown into the river. In return, he plans to murder the first-born children of Gotham. There are Biblical references in his storyline, such as those just mentioned. Selina Kyle turns from a mousy person to the confident and independent Catwoman and unleashes her repressed rage. Throughout the movie, her mind starts to deteriorate (symbolically, along with her costume).The Penguin and Catwoman are characters that you feel very sympathetic for. Their actions may not be moral, but you feel sorry for them and their twisted minds. It's very interesting that the true villain in Batman Returns is Max Shreck, who is the most normal of the three villains, which shows that a normal, everyday, and common human being can be a selfish cruel manipulator.A second interesting idea is the theme of duality. There's Bruce and Batman, Selina and Catwoman, politician Cobblepot and Penguin, and publicly popular Shreck and metaphoric vampire. One of my favorite lines is when Bruce says to Selina, ""I mistook me for someone else.""Another very interesting idea is that the three villains mirror parts of the title hero's psyche. The three of them show what Bruce/Batman would be like if he had gone the wrong way. One of the characters' lines is, ""To destroy Batman we must first turn him into what he hates the most. Namely, us."" Penguin is a twisted version of Bruce. They are both orphans. Like Bruce, Penguin wants revenge for the loss of a normal childhood, but he unleashes his anger on innocent people. Selina is fed up with the injustice in her life and wears the mask of Catwoman to do something about it. She becomes a more destructive version of the vigilante Batman and strikes back at society. Max Shreck is a business man like Bruce, but is very dishonest, selfish, and manipulative in order to achieve his goals. In the debate of Max's proposed power plant, Bruce represents the good side.All this character depth shows how brilliant and thought-out this movie is. I wish Burton had directed the third movie. He would have done an excellent job with Riddler and Two-Face.",Batman Returns
581,Kenna,Burton´s triumph!,10,23 September 1998,"In this movie Tim Burton really succeeds to put Batman in the dark world of Gotham where he actually belongs. No bright shiny  colours or bad cut action scenes as in the horrible followers by Mr Schuelmacher.The story is excellent, you really understand WHY this persons put on masks and change into their alter egos. The acting is superb. Keaton,DeVito and Walken is great and on top of that, the queen of this movie, Michelle Pfeiffer. The best scene is when she turns into Catwoman for the first time and the one where ""the bat,the cat and the penguine"" first meet outside the exploding store. But of course there are several highlights. And who can resist a dialogue with lines like: ""Oswald, It´s some BODY here to see you..."" followed by the entrance of lovely miss Pfeiffer.Add to this Danny Elfmans music and ofcourse the outstanding settings and you have this great movie. By far the best in the series and possibly the best ""make-a-cartoon-alive"" movie ever made.",Batman Returns
582,MIKE-287,"Essentially, the end of the franchise",8,3 August 1999,"Batman Returns marks the end of one of the most potentially profitable franchises for Warner Bros. While the character development may not have been as stylish as the first, the somber tone that the series is known for remains intact (aided by Danny Elfman's spectacular score). This sequel narrowly edges out the original as my favorite in the series. Perhaps the fact that this film deals primarily with the ""dark side"" of human nature is why it did not appeal to most audiences. It's a shame that Joel Schumacher sold out the series by slowly replacing the drama behind the Batman story with the cartoonish claptrap that puts merchandise revenue in W.B.'s pockets. If they choose to do a fifth, it would probably be best to use Tim Burton's ""gothic"" Gotham City and the ""Batman: Year One"" plot line. If not, way to go Warner Bros. for destroying the Dark Knight.",Batman Returns

587,foxtrott007,"We're the same.-Split, right down the centre. Don't you see? We're the same.",10,3 October 2006,"Many of us find art agreeable only when the masterpiece itself touches something deep inside us. That is, the completed creation can only be accepted and appreciated if we can somehow personally relate to it. It was winter, here in Australia 1992 when I had seen Batman Returns at the cinemas and it blew me away. Both ""me's"". I was supposed to belong to an ideal, a standard, but at the same time I was living another life. Tim Burton was the first film maker to say its OK for a comic movie to be dark and to confess that darkness can happen to us all. After Tim Burton's Batman interpretations, many other dark comic book heroes and anti-heroes flooded the cinemas. Comic book folklore for decades had told of friendly, likable heroes with dashingly handsome smiles and magical superpowers who fly in the sky, and spun powerful webs from their wrists and wore red boots and had the strength of a locomotive. But what happens when you are only ten years old and you see your parents coldly executed in front of your very eyes? You snap. Somewhere in your psyche,your young tender psychological make up breaks apart. The only way such pain and hurt can be managed is to create an alternate persona.You make a promise. Your other self will be stronger, harness all the anger all the rage to use whatever means available to avenge the innocence of your parents onto that criminal, those criminals, any criminal. This is life seen through Bruce Wayne's eyes. Both pairs. The world he sees is dark, gloomy, and cold. Although he patrols the streets and people hear him cruise by, they don't rush out to get his autograph. He is their Saviour, not the winner of a personality contest. Batman Returns is about losers. Batman, for yet another Christmas, remains ""the only lonely man beast in town"". Bruce Wayne never gets to lawfully arrest the vile Max Shreck. The Penguin never gets to unleash his pain of being discarded by his parents onto the citizens of Gotham, and Selina Kyle is forever lost to being mentally fragmented and traumatized. And the hero doesn't get the girl- or cat.This movie delves into the desire in all of us to want so desperately to belong, to have a home, as expressed by Bruce Wayne and Oswald Cobblepot.The film brings out a need in all of us to be heard, respected and not ignored as desired by Selina Kyle , Oswald and of course Bruce Wayne. But sometimes we are all suppressed in one way or another, we are told to be an ideal, to behave to a certain standard. That is until we finally snap. Only hope remains at the end of the movie as we see Catwoman rise towards the night sky. But come what may we all must wish good will towards all men and women. As for me , I cant say that I will reach a point where I will believe my problem with duality will be reconciled. But thats OK. We all have a dark side. Batman Returns is not only the best of the Batman films ,it is truly a stand out exceptionally fine masterpiece of storytelling.",Batman Returns
588,Picnic-3,A coldly intimate film.,7,8 October 2006,"Tim Burton followed up 1989's 'Batman' with Edward Scissorhands (1990) and elements of the latter film are evident in 'Batman Returns', namely the wintery feel and characters unusually formed since birth (Edward and The Penguin respectively- by comparison the first Batman film shows that The Joker and Batman were created in adulthood). Even the pastel pink houses of Edward Scissorhands seem mirrored in the pink interior of Selina Kyle's (Michelle Pfeiffer's) apartment but with a difference-this is the suburbanite bubblegum pink of the mid 1980s, when Madonna was actually a 'True Blue' conservative (a Thatcherite 'Material Girl'. What first attracted her to the millionaire Bruce Wayne? Well, Catwoman doesn't actually know that Bruce is a millionaire. It's never hinted at but perhaps it's actually sweet Selina (so interested in company records) who has more money-minded intentions. As Catwoman, she has now moved on to Madonna's 'Erotica' phase of the early 90s.The Gotham City of Batman Returns feels, possibly unintentionally, like a small to medium sized city, as opposed to the towering skyscrapers and cathedral of the first film. The architecture of Batman Returns is reminiscent of modernist architecture from the 1930s and the austere lettering of the 'Shreck' building is like the graphic design from that time. Whereas the first film had the engaging Knox and various other side characters, Batman Returns is very much concentrated on the 3 villains. Commissioner Gordon and butler Alfred have just brief appearances. The assortment of circus-like goons (who are Batman's only real foes) give a carnival-like look to some of the film, slightly alike to Tim Burton's next film, The Nightmare Before Christmas. The best of Danny Elfman's score is re-used from the first film and the other songs do not form the centrepiece to scenes, unlike the way that Prince's did in the first film.Despite Jack Nicholson being widely though to have stolen all the scenes in the first Batman film (he should do if he was paid 50 million dollars), the warm, dry wit of Michael Keaton's Bruce Wayne shone through and memorably stood up to the Joker in the scene in Vicky Vale's apartment where he demands of The Joker: 'Do you want to get nuts? Come on- let's get nuts!' In Batman Returns, so little time is given to the Bruce Wayne character that the Wayne/Kyle romance appears to be little more than a speed date. Even Batman doesn't have many memorable encounters with any of the villains. I can't remember him laying a hand on The Penguin or Max Shreck, instead opting to flirtatiously fight with Catwoman. (After Selina Kyle is found looking through company records and admits to Shreck that she knows of his plans to drain away rather, than provide power to, Gotham City pushes her through a window, causing her to hit her head and be bitten by various cats, after which she feels compelled to rebel against her mousy image and dress up in tight fitting black leather). However, no good reason is hinted at why Catwoman has taken a dislike to Batman other than perhaps envy. There are fewer memorable set pieces than the first film, where The Joker used a hand buzzer to kill a gang member, sunk a quill in to another's neck and gassed an entire art gallery (and later attempted to do the same to the main street in the city). Instead, The Penguin's tricks all come from his umbrella, apart from when he injures somebody by biting their nose. The giant rubber duck on wheels climbing steps in Ice World, before later crashing, was a surreal high-point though, almost a nod towards the supposedly camp 1960s series that was actually sometimes quite scarily surreal with its tilted camera angles. In the tradition of Frankenstein (and Edward Scissorhands), it seems that Burton wanted to give each of his 'monsters' a positive side. Shreck is shown as willing to sacrifice himself to save his beloved son Chip (a chip off the old block) and vice versa. The Penguin was brought up in a sewer and, therefore, we feel sorry for him for that. Arguably one of the most moving scenes out of either Batman film is when he is laid to rest by the penguins he lived with.Batman Returns can't top the set pieces, the witticisms or the scale of the first film (I'm sure it wasn't meant to) but anybody primarily looking for a quirky, coldly intimate film with great costumes and striking design will give this film the even higher score of 8 or even 9 out of 10 that it arguably deserves.",Batman Returns
589,louisjsmith,More Edward Scissorhands than Batman,8,8 March 2021,"After making Batman together, both Burton and Keaton return for this second film and this time, it's a better effort with the villain being more fleshed out and Bruce Wayne having more chemistry with Michelle Pfeiffer's Catwoman than he did with Kim Basinger's Vicki Vale in the previous film. This time, the studio let's Burton loose in realising his vision but that's not necessary a good thing. Batman is still marginalised as a character and we know no more about him than we did in the previous film and like much of Burton's recent work, the film tends to be a case of style over substance. The plot also tends to lose focus at times in favour of Burton's set-pieces and schtick. That being said, the film is visually stunning and and it's haunting music is wonderfully scored by Danny Elfman. Penguin is a grotesque but sympathetic villain played by Danny Elfman and Michelle Pfeiffer provides sass as the sexy Catwoman. Walken also chews the scenery as the sleazy Max Schrek and Gough is wonderful as always. Keaton might not be great at playing Bruce Wayne but he is a wonderful Batman but unfortunately, he doesn't get much to do. After the film was released, there was a backlash from parents who found the film too dark for their children and McDonald's also swayed the studio to change direction, so Burton left. Compared to what followed, this film is a masterpiece and it's a shame that Keaton didn't continue as he was growing into the role. Overall, this film was a solid entry in the Batman pantheon, but it's only weaknesses are pacing problems and lack of plot.",Batman Returns

Christopher Walken you are a god - you just had to love his character as for Michelle Pfeiffer wot can you say she is gorgeous and the chemistry between herself and Keaton made you believe in the characters and wished they were together in the end...Tim Burton was a master of directing this sequel, the gloomy dark side of each character bounced off one another and it was a pity that he did not make any more Batman movies..",Batman Returns

His height alone will be difficult to cast as the penguin in comics doesn't look to be so tall. apart from the height, his cunning voice and look add up a awesome look, Tim Burton also recreated this role. the penguin's nose which is much pointier than other versions of the penguin,and in this movie it shows the penguin's origin, from where he was born till he dies. kinda cant blame someone who rejected at birth because of his look and thrown into a sewer as seen.Devito has aged and wont likely ever do this in the new franchise although it would'nt be a bad choice.",Batman Returns

I think Tim Burton has a great merit in some readings (the bat suit, the vehicle) of the batman character but he was too occupied with giving us his dark vision of the world and human relationships that he forgot the character itself and principle ones. Jim Gordon, always present in the comic book, is restricted as an appearance and the English humor of Alfred, like his very important role as MD, vanished. Yes, you can say that the penguin (Danny Devito) and catwoman (Michelle Pfeiffer) do their dirty job in egregious way but even the role of the villains is overtaken by the enforcedly dark atmosphere that you can breath everywhere. Not thinking about the physical capabilities of Michael Keaton, Bruce Waine is a lone wolf but he has a public figure of playboy and crazy rich boy.

596,nldogg13,Underwhelmed and unsatisfied,4,20 February 2012,"Overall I found this movie to be throughly disappointing. With Batman (1989) setting the groundwork for what could have been a tremendous series with almost limitless possibilities, I feel that Batman Returns was a step backwards.Overall the visuals were pretty amazing, especially for the time. Tim Burton at his dark brooding finest. Unlike Superman and Spiderman, Batman is suppose to be a dark, tormented individual with many complexities with his life. Tim Burton really nailed the overall feeling of this and plays on it nicely. I also enjoy the fact that the death of Bruce Wayne's parents was not rehashed, as was relentlessly in the future installments, thus taking away from those movies. The visual effects of Batman Returns were effective and used in moderation and to an expert degree.I feel that the majority of the issue with Batman Returns is the overall story. The background of the Penguin was nicely covered and added to the empathy felt for Oswald Cobblepot, however Catwomen, who had more a villainous role was cast by the waste-side. A lot of Selena Kyle's backstory was done with simple spoken word and felt crammed into the script and didn't fit the mood or purpose. Such as Selena telling us that she is single and that she lives alone, we could have gathered that visually. Very little was explained after her transformation as to where her martial arts training came from and what her overall agenda was, other than going after Max Schrek. I also couldn't help but notice the total uncomfortable and awkwardness between Catwomen and Batman. It felt like uncomfortableness between the actors as oppose to struggles between the characters, their feelings and their agendas.There was no real climax to this movie as it kind of just dragged along. The Penguin's death was rather lame and uneventful, almost meaningless as Catwomen became the main focal point although Penguin was portrayed as the catalyst against Batman.The directing, the musical score and the actors were all fairly good, the story just handicapped them from bringing any real power or life to their characters. At any rate this is still the second best Batman out of the first four (pre Chris Nolan) but it in no way lived up to, equaled, or came close to the 1989 blockbuster.",Batman Returns

599,stephen-donnelly11,Batman Returns with a darker edge,8,4 July 2005,"Batman released in 1989 breathed new life into the enigmatic crime-fighter. With a brilliant over-the-top performance by Jack Nicholson as the Joker and beautifully dark set-designs that captured the true essence of Gotham City, made Batman a huge hit. A sequel was bound to happen and it did in 1992 but did it live up to the expectation of the first Batman?Well, to be honest it comes down to opinion, while the first Batman may be the more popular choice of the two, there's no denying Batman Returns has evolved the Batman story wonderfully and while the first Batman may have aimed at kids and young adults, Batman Returns isn't aimed for kids or going for Box Office millions like the first film. It seems with Batman Returns director Tim Burton had far more influence over this film than the original.Batman Returns is a dark, gripping and almost eerie film that doesn't contain the same atmosphere as the first Batman, Batman Returns is far more darker and the scenery helps suggest this. Gotham city is covered in snow and skyscrapers are fully placed around the city. Although, it's quite stunning to view these great sets, it's almost beautiful in that Tim Burton fashion. Movies like Sleepy Hollow, The Nightmare before Christmas and Edward Scissorhands feature wonderful sets that are amazing to view and with Batman Returns it's no different.Performances in Batman Returns are all very good. Michael Keaton returns as Batman and delivers a far more deeper and darker performance than his earlier performance. Although, in Batman Returns we learn more about Batman, it doesn't mean Keaton makes Batman more acceptable or open, quite the opposite as in Batman Returns the Batman character is less appealing but more compelling in a peculiar way. The reason for this is because of the way Keaton has made the character more concealed with his emotions and makes us want to observe the character more and really watch his reactions. Michelle Phiffer and Danny De Vito give great performances as Batman's duo adversaries. Although neither performance reaches the extent of Nicholson's "" The Joker"", they still dig into their characters and manage to produce two very good performances that allows the viewer to not only be entertained by Batman's enemies but also be interested in their own story and how the characters evolve throughout the film.Overall, Batman Returns arguably isn't as good as the original but nevertheless still is a very good film and helps reminds us that Batman isn't a colourful and action-packed movie like Spiderman, The Hulk or The X-men, but a far more deeper and dynamic film that stays true to the characters and the story, unlike Batman Forever and Batman and Robin., the following sequels. I personally don't enjoy super-hero movies but with Batman Returns it's different and being a fan of Tim Burton, it's a pleasure to watch his dark and eerie style capture the real essence of Batman in Batman Returns and the snow-filled sets of Batman Returns, I found to be quite amazing and enjoyable to view, vintage Burton.",Batman Returns
600,Broddie3030,One of the most misunderstood films ever made.,9,17 November 2005,"When it came time to make a sequel to BATMAN, Tim Burton decided that he did not want to make a conventional sequel. Those are good too & with the proper imagination driving it could work well. Instead of giving us the Bruce Wayne that is self assured, he gave us a more realistic take on the character. A recluse who uses the guise of Batman as therapy. He may or may not be as psychotic as those that he fights depending on who you ask. This characterization fascinated film students, regular movie goers and more open minded Batman fans. However it also angered the fans of the ""real Batman"". The ones who don't want to see an adaptation but a direct translation of the comic books because they don't really understand the differences between comics & film. They don't quite get what may work best in one medium and what works best in the other. A lot of these same fans do admit that while they didn't like Wayne though they thought Batman was pretty well done.Burton was into creating something a bit more original so he kicked up the German expressionism influence that Bob Kane & Bill Finger had in their very first ""The Bat-Man"" stories from 1939, when it came to creating Batman Returns. The film is a metaphorical representation of Bruce Wayne's psyche. Each character in this film represents a different aspect of Bruce Wayne's persona. It shows how all these aspects of Batman's mind cannot function as one. He is too disjointed because of the trauma he received the night his parents were killed. A lot of things in the film show us this. One example is when Batman blows up a guy then we see that at the same moment Catwoman blows up a department stores. They are one in the same, Catwoman represents the vigilante side of Bruce Wayne. Max Schreck & The Penguin also represent flip-sides to the Batman coin. The tough millionaire business man & the sad orphan longing for his parents love. There are also biblical references sprinkled throughout, many films students have pointed out that in certain ways The Penguin is a very evil & disturbed version of the biblical character Moses.To me this is my favorite of the Batman films for that reason. I love the subtext of it and how there are so many ways to interpret it. That's what a great film is supposed to do. The fact that somebody even approached a superhero film as an homage to German expressionism because it added a certain depth to it & showed the potential of what could be done with these characters that we all love. I also feel that the romance between Catwoman & Batman is the best in any superhero film to date. For the record I've been reading Batman comics since I was 6 years old, I am now in my 20's it's not that I don't understand the character it's that I understand that in his 60 year history there have been too many interpretations for anybody to claim that there is a ""definitive Batman"". As a fan I am thankful for all 5 of the Batman films because they each showed how diverse the character could truly be just like the comics also have. They all have flaws and some of them are not that great but they all achieved what they set out to do. Be adaptations of in my opinion the greatest character in American fiction.",Batman Returns

Keaton plays Wayne better than Kilmer or Clooney and his acting recreates the dark moments in the cartoons.

Tim Burton did another excellent job on this film and to bad it was his last of doing this film. The cast did a excellent job and writing was good and the cast match there character respectfully. Not to mention the performance of Catwomen was excellent and made a great screen performance with Batman and made it a great to watch film that kept every one of there seats. And there on screen Romance kept every one wondering what going to happen,Batman Returns
603,ArchKiller,Beautifully Twisted,9,8 June 2007,"Although I love Jack Nicholson's portrayal of the Joker in the first Batman installment, I have to say that Batman Returns is my favored movie in the Batman franchise. It is so wonderfully dark and psychologically twisted, yet there is hope for redemption in the affection that Batman and Catwoman develop for one another. For me Michelle Pfeiffer'sC atwoman represents the ultimate (anti)herione: intelligent, devious, sexy, fragile, unresistable, and tough as a bag of nails. How could you resist her? Danny DeVito is still as scary and magnetic as the Penguin as when I first saw the movie back in 1992. Michael Keaton does a great job reprising his role as the brooding, yet human, Batman. And when the hell isn't Chistopher Walken a bad ass you wouldn't wanna mess with? The special effects and make-up designs are very impressive, and Burton's look for Gotham city - that kinda dark, Gothic, modern 1930s look - is still, in my mind, the only accurate representation of Batman's home.A must (re)see for all true Batman fans!",Batman Returns
604,Fierce_almond,"IMHO, it's crap.",4,23 August 2005,"I think this movie is horrible. Tim Burton has a unique style of making movies, and they are good. But, taking his style and adapting it to Batman just doesn't work. It also screws up the story(whoever wrote it contributed in making this movie crap.).I'll start with the story. The Penguin is not a sludge-spewing, half-man half-penguin who lives in a sewer. He is an upper-class villain midget who dresses in a suit, hence the name Penguin. Catwoman was OK. I hated almost everything about this movie.Also, Michael Keaton is the second worst Batman ever. The first is Val Kilmer.Bleh.",Batman Returns
605,kevjbps,One of the best Batman movies ever created,10,5 March 2016,"You can say that this is the best Batman movie that ever created, and of course, along with the ""The Dark Knight (2008)"" which i consider it the 2nd best Batman movie, and then the original Batman ""Batman (1989)"" which comes to the 3rd place. All other Batman movies are not-so-good, and they come in the following places: 4th place: Batman Begins (2005), 5th place: The Dark Knight Rises (2012), 6th place: Batman Forever (1995) 7th place: Batman & Robin (1997).Actors who portrayed Batman from Best to worst as following: 1st: Micheal Keaton, 2nd: Christian Bale, 3rd: Val Kilmer, 4th: George Clooney, pending: Ben Affleck (we will see which place Ben can get later in 2016).P.S: Michael Keaton will always be the best actor who played Batman(the best Bruce Wayne)",Batman Returns
606,Lycanthrope19,The Greatest of the Batman Movies,10,5 December 2005,"It's been said that Batman Begins in the first Batman movie to ""get it right"" but I think that's a horrible overstatement, for I think the new Batman film, although greater that Batman Forever and Batman and Robin, pales compared to Tim Burton's classics, with this one being the best of the five. The darkness is beautiful, as is the music and scenery, creating a Gotham City cloaked in mystery, unlike Batman Begins, where Gotham City is a normal-looking city. The villains are terrific in this movie. You literally can't take your eyes off of the penguin and cat woman. I applaud Tim Burton for being original with his use of the penguin as a freak, rather than an ordinary criminal or a clone of the old Batman TV show. In Batman Begins we have the scarecrow, whose not nearly as demanding on screen as the penguin or cat woman. The film doesn't need to focus only on Batman, because we already know his story, and it is the villains who we are exploring and trying to figure out, and they are the ones who create the plot, with the penguin running for mayor and seeking revenge for his parents' desertion by killing the first born sons of Gotham, a task he fails. Danny Devito gives the finest performance ever by a superhero villain in any film, surpassing even Nicholson's joker. The closing scene where the penguins drag the dead body of the penguin into the water is touching and powerful. It's a tragedy that Tim Burton wasn't allowed to complete his trilogy, since Warner Bros., interesting in marketing appeal, wanted to ""lighten"" the Batman movies up. And they got their wish...unfortunately. Tim Burton planned on directing the third film, using the Riddler as the villain, with no Two-Face and Robin to mess it up, and I'm sure Michael Keaton would've signed on. So this is the last great Batman Film. Batman Begins is dark, but boring, tedious, ordinary, filled with lackluster villains, and a playboy Bruce Wayne. A decent Batman film, but the best Batman film ever? Never. Batman Returns holds that crown.",Batman Returns
607,nospam-286,This movie blows,1,16 April 2006,"The difference between this movie and the original Batman movie is that there was no Jack Nicholson to carry the movie and make up for Tim Burton's obsession with being weird and artsy and not knowing anything about the subject matter. Thank God Batman Begins came around to right the wrong created by ever hiring Tim Burton to make a movie about comic book characters when he thinks it's beneath him to actually learn about the comic book character's history.Aside from trying to cram two villains in to a movie to make up for neither one being Jack Nicholson and neither one pulling off the performance and adding in Christopher Walken's character for no apparent reason, the movie goes out of its way to disgusting for no reason. Being dark is one thing, but this movie goes over the top just to satiate Burton's ego.",Batman Returns
608,tam-reed,It is way better than Batman and Batman Forever,10,22 December 2005,"Many people say that batman forever is better but it isn't, not by a long-shot.Danny Devito and Michelle Pfeiffer are excellent as the Penguin and Catwoman.The plot of the story is good:One baddie wants to be mayor, and one falls in love with Batman.Christopher Walken was good in the film as Max Shreck and did a believable performance.When Batman Forever and Batman & Robin came out Gotham was turned into a neon lighted skyscraper glow stick palooza.In the first two films Burton made a more realistic environment, with a more realistic group of good guys and bad guys.The only Batman movie better than this one is Batman Begins.10/10.",Batman Returns
