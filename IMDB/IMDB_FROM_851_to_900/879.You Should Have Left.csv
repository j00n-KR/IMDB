0,Leofwine_draca,Subdued haunter,5,12 November 2021,"Another day, another haunted house film starring Kevin Bacon, this time reteaming with STIR OF ECHOES helmer David Koepp. This one's the lesser film, not particularly bad, but just very subdued and familiar with a real dearth of scares. It does manage a spooky atmosphere at times, but it suffers from routine scripting that gives the characters harsh dialogue and makes them all rather unlikeable; Amanda Seyfried is sorely underutilised too.",You Should Have Left
1,SnoopyStyle,an hour of nothing and then excellent,5,31 January 2021,"Theo (Kevin Bacon), his young wife Susanna (Amanda Seyfried), and their six-year-old daughter Ella have rented a vacation home in Wales. He is hounded by the notoriety of his first wife's death and its subsequent infamous trial.This is actually a pretty decent haunted house horror but it takes an hour to get there. It's not until he measures the room with a triangle does this movie actually gains any traction. The last half hour is really good as long as the audience is awake to see it. The first hour is so boring. The three actors are perfectly capable of pulling this off. The veterans and the little girl are all very solid. I really like the modernist house instead of a gothic mansion. It just needs to get to the point sooner.",You Should Have Left
2,Prismark10,You Should Have Left,3,27 June 2020,"David Koepp is Steven Spielberg's go to guy to fix a screenplay before it is ready to shoot.Jurassic Park turned Koepp into a marquee name. Since then he has also directed movies such as Stir of Echoes which starred Kevin Bacon.You Should Have Left is another collaboration between Koepp and Bacon. This one is less successful not because it has been released direct to streaming.Theo (Bacon) is a wealthy financier who is married to a much younger actress Susanna (Amanda Seyfried.) They have a young daughter Ella.When her latest film has scenes that she needs to shoot in Britain. They rent a large modern house in the Welsh countryside.The house has a bewildering layout with hidden doors, passageways and rooms. Theo has a feeling that something else is in the house. The time keeps changing and Theo's journal has messages telling him to leave the house.The film has shades of Stanley Kubrick's The Shining and the John Cusack film 1408. A house whose dimensions keep changing, Bigger on the inside than the outside is a cheeky reference to the Tardis.Somehow the house is alive, sentient and it is playing with Theo's mind. It makes you think that Theo is unstable.However the game is given away earlier in the movie regarding Theo's backstory and the circumstances of his first wife's death. The film holds no surprises and no tension.",You Should Have Left

Out of the blue, they decide to travel on vacation to a huge, isolated house in the Welsh countryside to resolve the problems in their relationship. But soon they have nightmares and Theo believes something evil is hidden in the house.""You Should Have Left"" is a low-budget film with great storyline and performances, highlighting the lovely and promising Avery Tiiu Essex.

5,classicsoncall,"""Don't curse unless you want to be cursed.""",6,1 March 2021,"If I were Kevin Bacon I'd probably be a little upset. The script writers seemed to take every opportunity to throw in lines mentioning how old he was. You don't have to be a vain guy to be upset about it, but you don't have to be reminded about it so often either. Even daughter Ella (Avery Tiiu Essex) in the story threw in her two cents worth at one point. Oh well, enough of that.Stories like this bother me a little bit because after a while, they have the feel of making it up as they go along. The endless rummaging around the expanding and contracting hallways of the Stetler home felt improvised with no end game in sight, and the nightmare gimmick gets played out enough times so that you lose track of what's real or not in Theo Conroy's (Bacon) experience. What it builds to is suggesting the title of the picture an analogy to Theo's prior marriage, which could have ended in divorce instead of his wife drowning in a bath tub. I presume one is supposed to consider Theo's guilt in conjuring up the horrific elements of the shape shifting house and his assuming the likeness of the absent home owner.But as others on this board have mentioned, the ending begs for a different resolution, as Theo's decision to stay behind with no push back from his wife and daughter is a hard swallow. In the spirit of the film, it's almost as if the film makers are letting you know you should have left.",You Should Have Left
6,paul_haakonsen,"Well, it definitely had potential...",5,19 June 2020,"I was lured in to watch this 2020 movie from writer and director David Koepp mostly by the movie's poster/cover, but also because I saw that Kevin Bacon was in it.I actually hadn't even heard about the movie prior to getting a chance to sit down and watch it, so I knew nothing about it, except that it seemed like a horror or thriller based on the poster.Having seen ""You Should Have Left"" now I can say that the movie definitely wasn't your average mystery about isolation in a strange house. And that was the movie's strong side, plus some good acting performances.However, the movie just ultimately failed to be outstanding and impressive. Sure, it was watchable, don't get me wrong. But it is not a movie where you leave with a ""wow!"" sensation when the movie has finished.The thing that takes place inside the remotely located house was interesting, and that was something that I enjoyed, but the storyline itself was just too bland and offered no big surprises or twists along the way.""You Should Have Left"" is definitely carried a great long way because of Kevin Bacon, as he steals the light in the movie.My rating of ""You Should Have Left"" lands on a very mediocre five out of ten stars. This is a movie that I doubt that I will ever be sitting down to watch a second time, as it just doesn't have enough contents to sustain more than a single viewing.",You Should Have Left
7,BandSAboutMovies,The loudest sigh,3,27 July 2020,"Man, I keep watching these Blumhouse movies and I keep getting depressed by figuring out their plots minutes into them and I keep doing it to myself.This would be a giallo, except it doesn't have any great fashion, good music, cool camera work, leather-gloved killers, trippy colors, weird plot movements or...actually it's not anything near a giallo. Because it kinda sucks.Also, I realized part of the way through that I was watching House of Leaves, but a really bad version of it. I wasn't alone. Author Mark Z. Danielewski said, ""Thanks everyone for bringing to our attention this measuring scene in YOU SHOULD HAVE LEFT. If it isn't theft, can anyone point to a scene of a man measuring the inside of his house against the outside of his house in any work other than HOUSE OF LEAVES?""Yeah.David Koepp is the ninth-highest ranked - money-wise - screenwriter of all time. He wrote I Come In Peace, so I'll give him a pass. Then again, he also wrote The Shadow, Secret Window, Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull and directed Mortdecai. Some people just keep getting chances in Hollywood. He also wrote Stir of Echoes, so maybe his work is just all over the place. He based the movie on the book You Should Have Left by Daniel Kehlmann.This would have been in theaters for a weekend if it wasn't for COVID-19. Man, I've been a downer on this one. Sorry.

Filmmaker David Koepp - adapting the novel by Daniel Kehlmann - reunites with his STIR OF ECHOES star Bacon as if they never left each other, complimenting its lead with a complex turn and its helmsman some cunning work at hand.

It's far from boring, quite the opposite. I thought the story was well written, there's some mystery that keeps you guessing, but unlike some movies you will get some answers towards the end. Concidering the ratings it gets I expected worse but I did enjoy this mystery horror and I'm sure others will as well. Kevin Bacon has never been one of my favorites, he appeared in some dumb movies and series but here he's actually good. There's definitely a good tension building in You Should Have Left and the whole cast contributed to that. All the actors were convincing in this movie.

There some strange events occur and everything seems very weird.I liked this movie because it was very mysterious and had an interesting plot. After watching the trailer I was expecting to watch a horror movie but I have to admit that I was surprised since this movie is not a horror but a mystery movie. Regarding the interpretations of the cast, Kevin Bacon who played as Theo, Amanda Seyfried who played as Susanna and Avery Tiiu Essex who played as Ella were very good and their combination had a very good result.

16,cruise01,Decent horror thriller with an interestinf twist on the story.,6,1 August 2020,You Should Have Left (3 out of 5 stars).You Should Have Left is a fair psychological horror film about a couple who rents a house in a foreign country to get away from there daily lives. Amanda Seyfrieds character is an actress. Kevin Bacon is her husband who has that mysterious past that he is trying to hide from. When they stay at this unknown house which messes with there dreams and reality. Putting them in confusing mazes of hallways. They will have to escape from what they cant see.I cant give away spoilers but there is a twist that plays around with this mysterious house. Which shadows the characters. And messes with there perception. Kind of reminded me a little of Stir of Echoes. Also done from the same writer and director. The film is a little weak compared to that one.Kevin Bacon and Amanda Seyfried did okay with there characters. The film does have a slow and boring first hour which lacks in thrills and suspense. Does get a little creepy and suspenseful when it reaches the climax. The direction is decent. Slow build up but does keep you on the edge of your seats in the final half hour.,You Should Have Left

The film gets tedious after a while n apart from the star cast (Kevin Bacon) n the lovely locations, it has nothing good.
There is unnecessary hide n seek inside the house.
There is no tension but monotonous nightmares.

21,jtindahouse,Koepp proves horror/thriller is his strongest suit,8,18 June 2020,"David Koepp has had quite an odd directing career. He only does a film every 3-4 years at the most and the genre can range from extremely dark horror like 'Stir of Echoes', through to immensely light comedy like 'Mortdecai'. When he does venture into the dark thriller/horror world though it appears to me that's when he's at his best. 'You Should Have Left' is a fine example of this. In less capable hands this film could have been an absolute mess. In his hands though he manages to contain the chaos and turn it into something really dark and haunting. I was a big fan of this film.Having Kevin Bacon and Amanda Seyfried as the stars of your film helps things a lot. Neither are perhaps in the absolute top-tier of Hollywood actors, however both are very good at what they do. They are immensely watchable and even had the skills to have me forgetting I was watching a relationship with a 27 year age difference. Also Bacon is in incredibly good shape for a 60 year old it has to be said. The performance that blew me away perhaps the most though was child-actress Avery Tiiu Essex. So often I find children in movies extremely annoying and distracting. Not in this case though. She was charming, funny and never detracted from any scene.There's something so great about contained psychological thrillers. I love that this film isn't about trying to scare you with cheap jump-scares. There was one early in the film and I thought, oh no here we go, but after that the film settled down and was content to scare us with atmosphere more than anything else. I really appreciated that. Usually I despise dream sequences in horror films too, but in 'You Should Have Left' they kind of play into the story, so it is hard to get too angry at the film for having them.There were two or three ways this film could've ended, and it picked the ending type that I was most hoping to see. It was the icing on the cake for what was already a very fine horror movie. I highly recommend checking this one out.",You Should Have Left
22,kevin_robbins,This falls just short of being a great or classic but is definitely still worth your time,7,5 May 2021,"You Should Have Left (2020) is a movie we recently grabbed from Redbox and watched while on vacation. The storyline focuses on a family traveling abroad on vacation that grabs a magnificent house off Airbnb. Once at the house, the house unlocks a heinous history of the father that puts his and his family's lives at risk. This movie is directed by David Koepp (Stir of Echoes) and stars Kevin Bacon (Friday the 13th), Amanda Seyfried (Mean Girls) and Avery Tiiu Essex (Modern Family). The concept for this movie wasn't unique but the lack of originality didn't take anything from the film. The cinematography, filming angles and magnificent shoots of the house and landscapes were honestly breathtaking. As the horror elements take place the director does a good job with the way the film is shot, using great angles, shadows and backdrops. This isn't a perfect movie but it is a very entertaining and clever one. I would say this falls just short of being a great or classic but is definitely still worth your time.

23,GiraffeDoor,Moderate ambition executed moderately well.,6,28 April 2021,"Yeah, I know; it sounds like a ""Get out"" rip-off doesn't it?Plotwise they have very little in common but I do not doubt that this was to some extent trying to ride the latter's coat tails. You could argue this is exactly the kind of white people movie that Peel was *attempting* to send up.Nothing about this movie even suggests it has much potential. It's just that generic horror movie, do I need to elaborate by this point?But going in with low expectations, one could do so much worse that this far-from-lovable but strangely respectable effort that slowly goes somewhere without outstaying its welcome too badly.Keven Bacon brings a lot to this picture. The depth and professionalism he brings to what is admittedly a somewhat nuanced character definitely helps it maintain a certain credibility that the movie otherwise doesn't even seem to even want with its hokey dream sequences, bizarre attempts at light comedy and strange indifference to what should be red flags by characters.The human element of this isn't too annoying (Bacon helps, he really does) and it does factor in eventually but the whole feels pretty contrived.The kid is fabulous though.

The house has it's quirks, flitting figures, an odd geometry, doors appearing, a hidden corridor.

Much of the horror is of the psychological variety with a rising sense of dread developing as the narrative unfolds. Some great shots of seemingly endless corridors in both dream and waking sequences. A staircase. Many levels, lit by a single bulb, evokes The Cabinet of Dr Caligari. Time slips, warnings appearing in a journal kept by Bacon, a figure watching through a window when the house is empty, all add to an aura of weirdness.

31,aidanratesmovies,What's with all the low ratings?,8,3 December 2020,"An inventive and uniquely interesting psychological thriller- You Should Have Left certainly has its weaker moments, as well as a bit of a weak conclusion, but it's sure fascination and imagination into its storytelling is surely a nightmare you won't soon forget. First off, Kevin Bacon is fantastic in this film. I have seen him obviously act various roles in the past, but this is surely one of his best. He truly commits to his role throughout, and shows a larger amount of emotion through a surprisingly grounded performance, both of which I have not had the likes of seeing before. I also enjoyed the performance held by young actress Avery Tilu Essex, who was quite good as Ella in the film. Amanda Seyfried was fine, although she truly brings nothing new to her performance, or really to the film in general. It's a bit of a slow burn, but it's an endlessly interesting and creepy tale. The atmosphere is thick and it truly makes the most out of its setting, unlike many horror films of this type often do. It can be a bit bland at times. Its beginning is a little bland, before they reach the house. Its ending is a little bland, abrupt, and a bit cliche. I was fine with how things wrapped up, but I couldn't help feeling a bit unsatisfied in the scheme of things. The script for the majority is fantastic, but it can't seem to really stick the landing at times, and unfortunately it's at times when it may have just been most important. IThe cinematography also needs a mention, because not only was it beautiful, but part of the reason the film was so chilling to begin with. n the end, You Should Have Left was a decent thriller from Blumhouse, and one I wouldn't mind diving into the meaning of sometime soon.
My Rating: 7.5/10",You Should Have Left
32,burlesonjesse5,VIEWS ON FILM review of You Should Have Left,6,25 August 2020,"""What is this place?"" Why it's a house, a sort of weirdly constructed labyrinth that only the strangest of architects could come up with. In You Should Have Left (my latest review), said house is the star and its maze-like corridors are like taxing nooks and crannies.Anyway ""Left"" bills itself as a horror film (just watch the trailer) but it's probably more of a ""mind violence"" spectacle with a couple of jump scares and some analogous shadows. Is it ""keep you up at night"" scary? No not really. Does it get points for being somewhat original? Sure it does. Except for hinting a little bit towards 1980's The Shining, You Should Have Left is its own modern entity.So yeah, as something about a family who rents a Wales vacation home only to find out that the place is haunted and somewhat barren, ""Left"" builds slowly only to deflate and produce a lukewarm payoff. The performances are good though especially Kevin Bacon who layers up to play damaged banker and rattled husband, Theo Conroy. Amanda Seyfried plays Bacon's young wife Susanna (28 years younger actually) and Avery Essex plays Bacon's 9-year-old daughter Ella (Essex is more than adequate in the child acting department).The best moments in You Should Have Left actually don't involve the creepy. They involve the fiddly interplay between Bacon, Seyfried, and Essex. ""Left"" thinks it's a terror fest that sends your knees knocking but it's more a broken down drama about a household that probably didn't need to be formed in the first place. Director David Koepp who worked before with Bacon in the terrifying Stir of Echoes, adds a ghostly jolt or two to accompany the psychological swipe. The result is numbing, entailing, and refreshingly off-kilter. Basically You Should Have Left ""should"" provide you with a decent rental. Rating: 2 and a half stars.",You Should Have Left

A dark revelation is about to be unfolded as Theo tries to figure out the truth about himself & the house that he & his family are living in.I found the film to be quite bland, slow & boring. I mean I understand it's a slow burner & is more of a psychological thriller but it could've been more lively & in you face I think. The films run time at 84 is decent enough but the pacing is too slow for me & the ending was depressingly sad, not a great twist at all really.Overall a bland thriller. 4/10",You Should Have Left

We're being reminded 50 times Kevin Bacon is Old, Amanda Seyfried is obviously looked more like his daughter and young girl his granddaughter so just because he was married once before he is her grandpa's age.The movie regardless of it's characters relies heavily on dream sequences, shadows, opening doors and jump scares. The production value is good and has face value for the actors but there is no story to keep you interesting in element of surprise or scare. All you see in first one hour, they are dreaming and getting scared and in last 30 mints the reason for the house and why he earned it.

He seems out of his depth here which I know isn't the case.
Maybe he didn't like the script and found it hard to care?
Maybe he's forgotten how to make good films?
I've no idea but he's awful.
The plot is awful.
The script is awful.
Amanda Seyfried is OK for the brief time she's in it.
The child actor made me cheer for the ""antagonist"".
The exposition is so heavy handed that I've got a black eye.
The local Welsh shopkeeper was annoying as hell.
The scares are non-existent.
The psychological elements are lazy. Think Jacob's Ladder meets Poltergeist 3 with a hint of What Lies Beneath and the dream sequence from Drop Dead Fred. Now throw it all in a blender with a dog turd and you have this film.
I'm watching the last 20 minutes as I type this so this is a real time review. If the ending blows me away I'll be honest about it but everything that preceded this point has been a mess.
14 minutes left and it's still terrible and nonsensical. Kevin Bacon is getting worse!

40,markthomassintek,Not in your face horror but still very good,9,24 June 2020,"REVIEW - YOU SHOULKD HAVE LEFTStraight to streaming series this film was released on 18 June 2020.Starring Kevin Bacon who I personally love as an actor the film tells the story of a husband, wife and daughter who go to an isolated House in Wales to rekindle their marriage. Unfortunately through a series of events their relationship is pout to the test and eventually......... but........While staying at the house in Wales strange things start to happen, nightmares, shadows and strangely the house is bigger on the inside (not Doctor Who).Actually, a very surprising film as the scare factor is quite low for a horror but the suspense and expectation is classic Hitchcock, (yes personally I felt it was that good), leaving your own imagination to fill in the gaps and trying to guess what exactly is happening.Personally, I love films like this which do not give away the story until the end and even the keeps you guessing leaving questions unanswered not like many films today which throw everything in your face and resolve whatever it is all in the same film.This film takes its time to build up the interest and suspense, simply made but very effective and as for Kevin Bacon, even though he is directly Infront of you in a few other scenes (no spillers) you simply don't recognise him even in plain sight, Amazing acting!As for the house used in the film, this vacation home is located in Llanbister, a really small village in Powys in the historic county of Radnorshire and was designed by John Pawson, a famed British architect whose work is known for its minimalist aesthetic of the 'less is more' philosophy. The real house only has a ground floor, the second floor (upstairs) in the film was added by CGI. All downstairs shots were filmed inside the actual house whereas all second-floor shots were filmed in a studio.Worth a watch.Rating 9 out of 10",You Should Have Left

43,kjproulx,A Promising Setting with Very Little Payoff,4,20 June 2020,"There are far more films being made in today's day than ever before and that goes for all genres, but for some reason, it always seems like the Horror genre as the most. I know that's not true, but seeing streaming services like Shudder dedicating themselves to only Horror films, it's hard to not believe that. For that reason alone, I know there are many more throwaway Horror movies out there than memorable ones. That's actually due to my own personal taste as well though, because a Horror movie really needs to stand out in order to impress me. Much like Superhero movies or Comedies, both of which I love, they need to find ways of feeling fresh and not like the last 10 or 20 to be released. Sadly, one of the latest Horror releases, You Should Have Left, falls directly in between, ending up as a film that's trying to be very original, but not doing enough with the setting to warrant a watch.Theo (Kevin Bacon), his wife Susanna (Amanda Seyfried), and their daughter Ella all take a trip to a house, secluded from society. Susanna being an actress and Theo just wanting to do something fun with his retirement, they choose this place. Dealing with some personal issues as the house decides to play tricks with their minds, this movie is meant to be a huge psychological thriller. Unfortunately, the psychology of it all never really comes into play until the third act and I never once found myself invested before that. Sure, Bacon and Seyfried are giving fine performances and the last 20-30 minutes are somewhat interesting, but the entire film felt like a missed opportunity.Before watching it, I had only recently seen any promotional material, of which showed some very cool ideas and imagery. With that said, this movie takes far too long to present those images, which makes you wonder if the entire first and second acts needed to be as long as they were. For a feature film and how the overall story ultimately plays out, I absolutely feel this film could've been told as a short story. The funny thing is that it's actually based on a novel of the same name, by Daniel Kehlmann, but the overall premise is different. The changes they made to this story clearly were a detriment because it just didn't feel like a meaty enough story as a feature film.Getting back to the fact that this is billed as a Horror flick, the Horror elements nearly feel non-existent throughout the first two acts. The movie begins with a scare and a few very minor things present themselves to let you know something is coming, but that's it. There are a few well-done set-pieces, but they don't do enough with them. For instance; There is a sequence toward the end of the film that revolves around a bunch of doors, which I would've loved to have been explored as a movie in its own right. It's cool moments like these that are brushed over in favour of a plot twist that I didn't feel worked all that well, to be honest.In the end, You Should Have Left presents a solid setting but it doesn't do anything with it. Director David Koepp, whom I have admittedly not seen a lot of his work, impressed me with his fun touch on the film Premium Rush. I found that movie to be far more exciting than it had any right being, which ultimately made me make my decision to visit his newest work. This is a film that suffers from too much drama throughout the first half that really has not much of a payoff by the time the credits rolled. Personally, I found the whole experience to be hollow, which is a shame, because the makings of a good film were all in here, but even at 90-minutes is seemed to be stretched out too long. You Should Half Left is now streaming on-demand, but I really don't think it's worth your time.",You Should Have Left
44,kuarinofu,What a weird re-arrangement of The Machinist,5,13 July 2020,"'You Should Have Left' is not a bad film, the ambient soundtrack is nice, it is atmospheric and Bacon is giving a good performance. What's bad about it is that it is essentially the script for The Machinist (2004) with Christian Bale mixed with the early 2000s horror cliches.It is predictable and has very little original ideas in it. The start was very promising but after they arrive at the house it all just goes downhill. Feels like a cheap cash grab since horror films are constantly making money nowadays.

46,msbreviews,"You Should Have Left is an underdeveloped, undercooked, underwhelming disappointment.",3,20 July 2020,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)This movie has every ingredient to be a horror hit. David Koepp has written and/or directed phenomenal films: Jurassic Park, Mission: Impossible, Spider-Man, War of the Worlds, Stir of Echoes... the list keeps going. Add Kevin Bacon and Amanda Seyfried, and you've got yourself two fantastic leads. A horror flick set in a ""haunted house"", where the main characters go through some sort of a psychologically disturbing journey? The synopsis convinces me! So, with all of these features, there's no way this movie will fail, right? Yeah... It couldn't be more disappointing.You Should Have Left ultimately doesn't know what genre it belongs to. Koepp clearly takes inspiration from a bunch of other films (some from his own filmography), completely forgetting to develop the one at hand. Everything about this movie feels unfinished, or, being totally honest, everything feels like it's just an idea or a concept yet to be explored. Bacon and Seyfried interpret characters far from being persons with motivations, aspirations, or even personalities, especially Susanna, who is manipulated as a mere plot device to make things happen. She's an actress... that's her entire characterization.As the viewer, I finish the film without knowing a single thing about any character. Theo has some sort of ""past"" (like every other Blumhouse's main character of a horror flick), which is barely explained in detail. The only moment where some backstory is given to his character is an utterly unbelievable exposition dump between the mother and her daughter. This is the only personal development that Theo receives: an event that happened in his life described in a forced conversation between characters that definitely shouldn't be having it.Koepp's movie is marketed as a psychological horror film, but it doesn't even possess the necessary technical attributes to create suspense or a scary environment. The ""haunted house"" looks way too bright, modern, and not claustrophobic at all. The editing (Derek Ambrosi) is weirdly out of sync with the score (Geoff Zanelli), and despite Angus Hudson's cinematography boasting a few nice shots, it doesn't really help to create the necessary atmosphere. It just doesn't look nor feels like a horror film. Just like with the characters, Koepp doesn't know where he wants the story to go.There's an attempt at creating a drama within the family that doesn't work because, well, there are no *characters*, so I couldn't care less about their arguments. Then, an unnecessary sci-fi element is introduced, and it's bafflingly left unexplained. Finally, a mystery surrounding the house's size is approached, but just like the rest of the movie, it doesn't go beyond its concept. In fact, this is the most captivating aspect of the whole film, but it's only introduced after one hour of runtime. This movie tries to follow so many different paths genre-wise that it forgets to actually choose one...Overall, You Should Have Left had tremendous potential to be a genuinely intriguing psychological horror flick, but David Koepp gets lost in the many ideas present in the film. Kevin Bacon delivers an excellent performance, and Amanda Seyfried (underused) also lends her undeniable talent, but both interpret characters far from being so. Koepp's screenplay holds so many underdeveloped concepts and extremely superficial attempts at balancing distinct genres that it totally forgets to actually tell a convincing story with complete character arcs and interesting plot points. Even technically, its well-lit, modern house doesn't generate a suspenseful or spooky atmosphere. The editing and the score are also weirdly put together. Unfortunately, it's underwhelming and disappointing. I can't really recommend it.Rating: D+",You Should Have Left

51,MrDHWong,An odd movie that can't seem to settle on what audience it wants to appeal to,6,19 November 2020,"""You Should Have Left"" is a horror drama film based on the novel of the same name by Daniel Kehlmann. Directed and co-written by David Koepp (Secret Window, Ghost Town) and starring Kevin Bacon and Amanda Seyfried, it is an odd movie that can't seem to settle on what audience it wants to appeal to.Theo Conroy (Kevin Bacon), is a wealthy retired banker who lives with his actress wife Susanna (Amanda Seyfried) and their young daughter Ella (Avery Essex). One day, the three of them decide to take a vacation in Wales, staying in a nice looking house on top of a hill overlooking a small village. Upon settling in at the house, the family's initial excitement turns to fear as each of them are plagued with terrifying nightmares and strange passages of time, causing them to believe that something is clearly not right with where they are staying.Despite being advertised as a horror film, ""You Should Have Left"" only offers sporadically jarring moments that could really be considered scary. The first two thirds of the film are very exposition heavy, almost as though they are leading us to believe that this is going to be some kind of family drama, only to toss in some fairly tame twists and turns during the final act in an attempt to categorise this whole experience as horror. This may have worked had all of the information unloaded onto us actually led somewhere interesting, but for the most part it felt unnecessary as it spoiled any potential for building up the important tension required. As a result of this, the film feels more like a voyeuristic soap opera focusing on a family living in a strange house rather than some cleverly veiled horror/thriller from the folks at Blumhouse.David Koepp does a decent job in the director's chair, even if he does become bogged down in the aforementioned scenes of overly long exposition. What I admired most was the way he made the interiors of the house look, with large, spacious rooms that lead to nowhere or lengthy hallways that seem to never end. Even if this was underused and wasted at the most crucial of times, it did leave something of an impression on me and at least made the film pleasant to look at. Unfortunately, Koepp fails in the most critical area: creating suspense. This film never really felt as though it was on the brink of any startling revelation or that something big was at stake, as most moments that could have been scary often ended up being false alarms. There are the occasional jump scares that, while I'm not usually a big fan of in horror films, could have been worked had they not been a result of a character having a nightmare and therefore not placing them in any real danger. For something that is allegedly supposed to a horror film, this is very lightweight on the scares.Surprisingly, the acting from the cast is of rather high quality. While I shouldn't be one to doubt Kevin Bacon's uncanny ability to chew the scenery in every film he is in or Amanda Seyfried's knack for demanding our attention with her alluring gaze, their chemistry felt so bizarrely believable that I really did feel as though the two of them were longtime husband and wife, in spite of their twenty-seven year age difference. This made scenes with the two of them interacting more watchable than they should have been and it definitely prevented things from becoming boring. However, I need to single out the young newcomer Avery Essex as their daughter Ella. I believe she did a superb job in the role, considering her age and the emotional heaviness of some of the lines she had to read. These three performances were the saving grace of the film, because if it weren't for these, I probably would not have cared at all otherwise.Overall, what I think brings this film down so much is how confused it is about its own identity. If it wanted to be a horror movie, then it is a failure, but if it simply wanted to be a family-focused drama then it has somewhat succeeded. The problem here is how the film has been marketed, with how Blumhouse Productions is so well known for producing primarily horror-based content that by mentioning this in the trailers and posters sets it up as something akin to the likes of ""The Purge"" or ""Get Out"". That's not to say this film is entirely bad, but instead I'd say it's a curious oddity that got lost somewhere along the way.I rate it 6/10",You Should Have Left

53,Beejerman,JUST OKAY - (6 stars out of 10),6,20 August 2020,"The stage curtains open ...Kevin Bacon is at it again in this latest thriller co-starring Amanda Seyfried. I was intrigued by this one after viewing the trailer. I'm a sucker for a good ""haunted house"" yarn, and that is what I was hoping for. I was hoping it would play out like ""Stir Of Echoes"" (which was a pleasant surprise to me), but it was somewhere in between that and ""The Darkness"" (which was a disappointment to me).Bacon plays the part of Theo Conroy, an older man with a much younger wife (Seyfried), and an inquisitive, little daughter. The unorthodox family are struggling with his shaded past, her blossoming acting career, and the stress of bringing up a daughter between them. In an effort to get away from it all, and have some much needed time between them, they find themselves in a vacation home in Wales where they quickly settle in, overwhelmed with its size and modern design. However, Theo's past catches up to him and threatens to destroy everything he loves ... again.Although I was ultimately let down with this film, I still felt it was ""okay"". Nothing grand, but not really that bad either. The house certainly does play a main character in the movie, but the not way I was anticipating. The final reveal was a bit lackluster, but still was able to raise an eyebrow and conjure a small smile. I give it props for it's originality, even if the delivery of it falls short of what I was hoping for. The camera work is pretty good, the cinematography well developed, and the characters were interesting and worth the time you invest into them.I'm a bit on the fence with this one. I think someday, I could watch this one again. But, I don't think a second or third viewing would really change my opinion of it.

All parties start to have unsettling dreams and experience a sense of unease and discomfort in the house. And other elements of reality start to bend leaving what is happening uncertain. The movie adds tension by adding some character conflict, and this only increases the chaos in the house. This film is more psychological in nature of its horror, and it builds to the conclusion. Not quite certain what all the negativity was around the reviews of this film as I felt it brought forth an interesting central issue and conflict resulting in tension and uncertainty. Some drawbacks include the somewhat standard acting of the leads (feels a bit underwhelming given the known talent of both leads), but the child does well in her role.

60,TwistedContent,"Crispy Bacon, but the Sauce is Watery",5,27 December 2020,"Like many, I was expecting a straight-forward, generic type of supernatural horror, so it was a pleasant surprise to tag along a decent story together with up-to-the-task Kevin Bacon. However, in the current state of horror genre, this story is truly familiar, the twists are very expected and underwhelming like that, and morale/s are not only old but also paper thin. It's a big story handled with seemingly not enough ambition.I remember ""You Should Have Left"" got dropped quite unexpectedly, accompanied with a poster that, frankly, looks like a dollar store DVD cover. All these months later I finally managed to catch up on this, largely thanks to Mr. Bacon. My love and trust in Blumhouse has started to fizzle out during the past two years, as more and more formulaic horror movies are coming out, but I'm glad to say that this one is not as bad as ""Truth or Dare"", ""Fantasy Island"" or ""Black Christmas"".A former banker with anger issues, Theo, together with his actress wife Susanna and adorable daughter Ella, have booked a vacation in a modern and isolated house in the deep Welsh countryside, to ease on all the problems they're having and to have a nice, good rest. Only the house, or something unknown in it, really does not want the fam to chill. As the story flows, offering melodrama carried out by solid performances, a few scare moments and the realization of this actually being a psychological drama/thriller, the movie segues into the awesome idea of them not being able to leave the house. A concept that gets less awesome every next time it gets put in the groundworks of a new horror film, or in other words, it needs a lot of additional sauce to work well. This concept receives a lot of time and attention in ""You Should Have Left"", only to climax the way I was expecting it. The way I was hoping it won't happen. Another purgatory film, I call it. Don't let me a bummer though, those less familiar with the themes of such stories, could get more kicks out of it than I did.This is actually David Koepp's third hooray into horror after ""Stir of Echoes"" (1999, also with Kevin Bacon) and ""Secret Window"" (2003). All three movies are based off novels. The latest, sadly, is also the least. The scope of ""You Should Have Left"" feels too narrow for the story it turned out to be about. Close, but no cigar. But one force in all that helped carry the movie on successfully is the crispy good performance from Kevin Bacon. Pun intended. Seriously though, I'm convinced the best parts of this thriller piece belong to Kevin, Amanda Seyfried also delivers, but rounds out as more of a secondary character, while Avery Tiiu Essex puts on a spirited little performance, reminding me of a mini Chloe Grace Moretz.It's not great, nor bad, it is decent, well-rounded decent.

65,SnobReviews,Freaky but could've been so much better.,4,22 June 2020,"""You Should Have Left"" will definitely make the hairs on your arms stand up but, it needed more of an in-depth storyline because it feels rushed.
.
In this suspense-thriller, a middle-aged man, his younger actress wife and their daughter book a haunted vacation home that begins to play with their minds.
.
The whole point of ""You Should Have Left"" is to try and escape this house. Running at 90-minutes, it doesn't give you enough time to understand the story and the characters well enough for you to care about what happens to them. Although, it is a freakishly interesting plot and it's nice to see Kevin Bacon in a film again but, this suspense-thriller should've been able to draw a viewer in more than it attempted to do so.

There are a lot of stretched out scenes, boring and uninspired dialogue, predictable plot twists and cliche characters that usually take dumb decisions. The only idea that I have really appreciated is the one of the house that changes constantly the internal environment, and I liked visual effects, photography and some camera movements.There is nothing much to say about this movie, the most ""interesting"" scenes are contained in the trailer, that spoiled basically everything, pretty normal nowadays, especially for horror movies.

""You Should Have Left"" has him tackling Horror as a successful senior who takes a vacation with his much younger actress wife and their young daughter. The neat and spacious house with its pastoral and breathtaking view promises a great stay but from the start things are not quite right. From doors that take a life of their own events lead to a multidimensional nightmare that finds the lead face to face with his dark past and the sacrifice he has to pay as atonement. The subtle atmosphere and languid pace of the film serve as a good contrast and build-up to the creepy and horrifying scenes. The flawed directing and flawed acting at parts snag scenes in the flick where the actors don't act as they should lessening realism and the lead-up to the ending is abrupt and quite an anti-climax. The film works nonetheless in its chilling simplicity where the supernatural experiences shown do happen in real life making the film scarier and more effective with its effect.

Yeah, it's fairly predictable, not very scary, and the directing never really rises above being just fine, but I was at least slightly invested in where it was going for a while, it seeming like a more self-reflective version of The Shining, which I was all down for.But as the end draws nearer, it becomes quite apparent that it's going to be a ""that's it?"" kind of ending, and it most definitely was.But still, I did feel as if everyone involved did at least care about the project...although I'm not sure if that's cause for concern or not.",You Should Have Left

Almost at once the perfect vacation turns into something not so perfect. Theo believes there is a unfriendly force in the house causing suspicion between him and Susanne to a point both believe they have not been truthful to each other.Why this scene started the movie made no sense to me at all. Ella is in bed and sees a shadow, then a man comes to her bedside. This scene did not start the movie. Was it a mistake to put it first? The movie actually starts when Theo and Susanne at their poolside home discuss going away for a vacation. That scene with Ella is at the vacation spot. See?Background. Susanne is Theo's second wife. Theo's first wife drowned in a bathtub and a jury found Theo not guilty of murder. For Self- Therapy Theo writes down his feeling about everything on a day to day basis. Susanne tells Ella about what happened because Ella wants to know why the tension between her and Poppa as she calls Theo. Sometime she calls him daddy, but mostly Poppa because he is much older than Susanne.I can deal with supernatural stuff and this is the case in here. The Shop owner, (Colin Blumenau) tells Theo that the house burned down and the Devil rebuilt it and he asks Theo, ""Have you met Statler?"" Apparently Statler was the original owner of the house. As Theo leaves the shop a woman (Lowri Ann Richards) stands next to his car and asks Theo, ""Have you met Statler?"" Apparently, the whole town knows about the house.The house has multiple hallways, and rooms and you would think it was alive because, at times, Theo and Ella get lost within.Things get dicey when Theo and Susanne agree to separate for one day. Theo and Ella are left to themselves, get lost in the house, decide to go to town and get away from the house only to find that they walked back to the house and Ella didn't understand that as she said they always walked down the hill to the town.Theo knows there is something or some kind of entity in the house that he must eventually confront. He doesn't know who wrote You Should Have Left in his notebook/diary. He believes Susanne did it. But we know the house is playing games with him, hallways are extended, lights to off and on, doors open and shut on their own, stairs that lead nowhere.The acting by all was very good, but a special shout out needs to go to Avery Essex as Ella. She is 6-yrs old going on 20. She is the best part of this story and she handles her job as an accomplished veteran. Kudos. We will see more of her, I am sure.This is not overly suspenseful, but it could have been. Kind of creepy but not horror creepy, but it could have been. I enjoyed it. (7/10)Violence: Yes.

82,RhapsodyReviews,Could Have Been so Much More.,5,7 July 2020,"Review:
'You Should Have Left' is a psychological horror film directed by David Koepp. It follows a middle-aged man (Kevin Bacon), his successful actress wife (Amanda Seyfried), and their young daughter (Avery Tiiu Essex) who book a haunted vacation home in Wales that begins to wear down their sanity.
This is a very confusing film and a hard one to review without digging into spoilers, but I will do my best. First thing is that this is not your run of the mill psychologic thriller. This is a movie that takes the idea of 'Groundhog Day' as if written by M. Night Shyamalan, while being in a modern-day version the Amityville Horror house. Now, that may sound good on paper, but it turned into a confusing story on screen.
Talking abut the acting, it was okay at best. I am a fan of Kevin Bacon, especial in the 90's and early 2000's with his darker films like 'Death Sentence' and 'Stir of Echoes' which was from the writer and director of this film. But there were times in this movie where he seemed to be holding back. Amanda Seyfried was flat during the film and never expressed any emotions that were necessary for us to feel sympathetic nor angry at her character. Avery Tiiu Essex who plays the couples daughter was actually pretty good in the movie and was the most compelling character hands down. From the very first scene we are routing for her character and at times feel scared for her.
Now, there is an age difference between Amanda Seyfried and Kevin Bacon's character. Even though the film did this on purpose, it was still very distracting and the two did not have any chemistry on screen. They feel like a new couple even though they have been together for years and have a young daughter together. But, pushing that to the side, it not the biggest problem in this movie. It's the fact that it's labeled as a horror film and the horror is pushed in the background to focus more on the characters relationship is a weird choice to say the least. Nothing happens horror wise or story structure wise until one hour into this film and it's only 90 minutes long.
Overall, it is an interesting concept with poor execution. I'm interested to see what reviews this film gets by both critics and audiences. If you're a fan of Kevin Bacon give this one a try, but don't watch it if you're a fan of their earlier collaboration 'Stir of Echoes' because you will be disappointed, muh like myself.

88,richardwworkman,It would be nice if all the bad people were punished but..,5,27 February 2021,"Living in England where Kevin Bacon is known for his adverts for mobile phone provider, EE, I initially found it very difficult to take this film seriously. This was particularly hard when we are presented the complexities of the two cell phone issue and lack of coverage at the start of the film. Wrong network, Kev.The pace of this film was a problem for me. It take a while to get going, additionally there are a lot of tangents to the story which felt unnecessary. it's an interesting idea but the plot felt oddly disjointed. I kept wondering why it was set in Wales at all, I couldn't see the point.On the plus side this is a great example of how architecture is used in the horror genre. The cottage becomes a dark mesh of Esher like forced perspectives, temporal shifts and spatial discordance. It become obvious from very early on that the building is some kind of portal. There are anxiety inducing shifts and disorientation.Bacon produces a decent performance as the lost middle aged man searching for some significance in this maze like mess of a building. While struggling to move on from the death of his previous wife, his new partner and daughter represents an opportunity for a new life.Ultimately though this is a bloody depressing story of how we carry our own ghosts with us, our past is inescapable and in the end, we take our sins to the grave where we will be punished by ourselves.It's an ok film but I can think of others that explored this idea more successfully.

They just aren't believable as a couple and it doesn't help that shes clearly young enough to be his daughter, grand daughter even. They try to play to it, but theres just no warmth between them so it just comes off as fake and cringy.Everything else in the film is equally clunky. His interactions with the townfolk are silly and kill the immersion. A bizarre and pointless casting choice for the ""villain"" is so ridiculous some audiences will laugh unintentionally.The spooky bits are neat but not frightening. Its all just too goofy.Its a shame because now I just want to go read the book and forget I watched this.

96,tresm87,"A decently mystifying psych thriller with a solid return from a seasoned Kevin Bacon, though lacking consistency in the overall recipe/plot.",7,18 June 2020,"In 1999, Director/writer David Koepp and Kevin Bacon teamed up to create a fantastic emotionally charged paranormal chiller called Stir of echoes. They make a fair combination in their return here, and Koepp even employs some similar stylistic choices and emotional themes that take you back to days of stir of echoes.However the story is slightly scattered and doesn't always flow together in the slower middle section. Also the attempts at creepy scares are contrived aside from a couple intense moments. There's a certain creepy atmosphere thats conveyed with the modernized house thats executed well with a wide array of sleek visual trickery. By the end when things spiral into a bizarre and insane shocking conclusion, the revelations of the past are made, and it does come together more cohesively. It swung for the fences in the end and I do applaud its brutal honesty though many will critique it.As far as Kevin Bacon goes, he's still as intriguing as ever, and commands the viewers attention at all times. He's the glue that holds the film together for sure, even if it's not one of his memorable performances. He's ageless at this point and I hope he comes back for good after his 4 year hiatus. Amanda Seyfried was not very good imo and quite annoying. Maybe even more so than the daughter and that's saying something.Overall this is a decent yet scattered film that harkens back slightly to older style psych thrillers based on people's inner demons and past mistakes. It has its flaws and it's merits and with scarce releases these days, it's not a bad watch.",You Should Have Left
97,joker-4,Standard Haunted House Fare,7,9 July 2020,"David Koepp's career has been one of equal parts schlock and pop culture fun across the genres of crime and horror, scifi and superheroes. A little of the mysterious here, a little of the trodden there. You Should Have Left, ably written/directed by Koepp and produced by Blumhouse, lands dead center.You Should Have Left teases artful What If...? elements before it plods into a standard haunted house tale where unrequited grief lurks as the de facto spook.The ageless Kevin Bacon is the true heart of the story as he cements his leading man chops in a yet different role, following his fantastic spin as a corrupt sheriff in Cop Car. Playing Theo Conroy, retired banker now full-time dad, Bacon seeks to spend family time with his young wife (Amanda Seyfried) and their seven-year-old daughter by booking a family vacation at an isolated house in the Welsh countryside. The house is a killer design but at the film's end it simply is a killer. Theo, you see, has secrets. As does Susanna. And the house feeds on those secrets while keeping its own.You Should Have Left possesses a simple and tight concept. The Conroys are an easily enough family to watch. Koepp builds on that family love; always winking and nodding at the family secrets. What really happened to Theo's first wife? Who is Susanna constantly texting? Aside from the occasional jump scare, that family drama does not make a compelling thriller. Too much of the pater familias; not of enough of genuine creepiness. When that horror finally ramps up? That's when the yeah-yeah-I-get-it screams of the genre take over only to quickly let go.Koepp crazily establishes his movie around the nightmarishly-modern house. Ever-changing layouts. Hidden doorways. Poorly-lit staircases. Weird Polaroid photos in the laundry room. Other than Bacon, the house should get top billing. There always seems more to explore with unanswered questions aplenty. And mostly? These all go unfulfilled.You Should Have Left wants to build into a creepy-yet-cathartic climax, perhaps similar to Blumhouse's reimagining of The Invisible Man. The family drama and the haunted house plots do not weave into a frightening disaster. Rather, they are combatants. And the fight is more of a slow struggle than a WWE slamfest. The already-short run time could have been trimmed even more and would have instead resulted into a clever ep of the new Twilight Zone. Instead, the conclusion is rushed while Bacon's hair is mussed.

But still, all that is combined into a movie that largely keeps you guessing, and is original in many ways.It's also nice to see a horror movie that is based on psychological elements, not monsters from another planet or, more commonly these days, supernatural beings.Plus, Keven Bacon gives a very good performance here. I think he is one of the least appreciated actors working today, even though he's been in many movies for decades.

Kevin Bacon is always fun to see acting and he does a good job here, carrying most of this film literally on his shoulders. The cinematography is eye-pleasing and the music and atmosphere immersive. Together with a sufficient run time which does not get long and tiring, these elements make it a good combo for a film to watch if you have no better alternative.
The main problem in this film is the dialogue and generally the script. Its difficult to say this is a great psychological thriller while its dialogue... kinda sucks. Luckily there is not that much dialogue in the second half of the film, so you can enjoy a bit the experience of a thriller which is not meant to jump scare you, but to give you an eerie feeling overall. 6/10",You Should Have Left

Loved the opening, so creepy and in the position, I was watching the movie it made me look if I had someone behind me, the chills swept me all over. Not only it had a great opening, but it also had a strong fright element in the light sequences. Those scenes got me good not like a jump scare kind of moment, it was more about putting myself in his shoes and I wouldn't be as calm even though I love those kinds of things I would have been so creeped out. The movie did have the potential to have an extreme horror element but it was at the regular level in which it could come off as flat and yet it did give at least a good sinister presence. The mystery of the house needed to broaden further because it left me craving for more.The composer Geoff Zanelli did a good job with his music but it had room to give it a more frightening tone to lift up the suspense.Loved the cast, it's been so long since I have enjoyed watching the performance of Kevin Bacon, I love how relaxing he was portraying his character, and when the moment came to be the opposite.

This film is more of a thriller than a horror. It is suspenseful but not particularly scary. It serves almost as an allegory for not letting your past bring you down, come to terms with it.
Kevin Bacon gives a great performance playing a washed up actor that has jealousy and trust issues.
Amanda Seyfried gives an equally good performance as his on screen wife and as a mother.

Not that it was needed, the time could have easily been spent understanding the family's background and the couples relationship a lot more; which would have made for a much more impactful film.A lot of time is also spent with regard to the architecture and the 'right angles' of the house and how it doesn't make sense. However given what happens inside the house these ideas seem somewhat pointless.There is also a bit of an issue with regard to how the house affects those living there. The focus and negativity is placed on the father because of his past whereas his wife is not affected (albeit she has her own sins). So it doesn't really add up that the child who is completely innocent is also subject to the pain of the father just through proximity.It's not a bad movie... it's just a bit of a waste of time.",You Should Have Left

It took what seemed an absolute lifetime for this story to get going. I think horror films and thrillers need to contain substance that define their genre from the very beginning and remain tense by keeping the thrill at a certain level.I did like the idea of the house and it's labyrinth, but the oddity of Theo being in the future seeing his past was confusing, there wasn't any substantial reasoning for it.",You Should Have Left

161,bobtis,Ok Ok how many of you watched this because of Kevin Bacon?,7,20 June 2020,Well I did I love the guy. Always a personal Favorite. He has done so much awesome work and now that he is on the down side of sixty this is what he is going to be doing. Lot's of poor scripts but studios still feel he's bankable. So there is my 2 cents about Kevin.The film was not bad I gave it a seven it had some production value and I like stories about time displacement and different universes. Started slow but it built up well. Shot in England it gave a very dreary kind of ghost quality. Kevin has never ever stared with a so so leading lady. Get's the beautiful ones. But what I loved about this film was it addressed that he is getting old. Just a fact he can not play a 20 yo any longer he is 61 I think and at the conclusion of the film it showed how great of an actor he is. Script was better than average the little girl was great. Amanda was not very good bad casting there. Not a good paring with Kevin. Anyway after watching a zillion films in the last 3 months I give this one a go. Do it for Kevin Bacon If your a fan. Love the guy.,You Should Have Left

It doesn't take something old and manky to haunt or create scary scenes. Which I enjoyed. I specially enjoyed the house evolving to some people and opening itself!Acting was wonderful. But the movie could have a better ending.Is this all in his subconscious mind where he is battling to let go of his desires to finally accept his guilt? Finally letting go of all the good to punish himself in his guilt and give up trying to live a happy life? Maybe. But that's why I like
Movies like these because you can think the way it suits you. So you become a co-story teller yourself. Which is awesome.It reminded me of Triangle. Initially I thought it will turn into Shinning, but it didn't. And there were places where It was a bit like Secret Window.Being a horror movie buff, specially psychological ones, I liked it.

It was later discovered that it is not so simple, it is still a time tunnel, which can make people with demons fall into the endless cycle of time like ""Terror Cruise"".But the flashback dreams, the memories that appear from time to time, are very confusing. I don't understand whether such a peculiar structure actually exists, or is it just a speculation in the male master's brain...I don't understand the water falling on the ground and the repeated triangles. What exactly is it for?But the love between father and daughter is so deep that I have a daughter. For the daughter to care about everything, the daughter is also really lovable, beautiful and loving, I think during Father's Day, it is suitable for such an atmosphere...I feel like I want to be complete, but with too many elements, it's easy to taste everything, nothing, and a bit of confusion, but ""Some people in this place can't get out, and the right people will always find the right place, and vice versa ""They were found in that place"". The idea is good, because the heart is born from the heart.

165,sugarnspices,Meh. Boring and undeveloped characters.,2,2 August 2020,"Was not impressed by anything about this movie. The acting, the plot, the scenery. Nothing.Other than just being overall boring, this movie was lacking every other aspect of a movie that draws you in.The characters? They aren't developed, therefore you don't care about them. Not to mention they are flat and unrealistic. Why would a seemingly successful 35 year old, beautiful Hollywood actress want to be with a 65 year old ex-banker that was up for murder charges at some point? When did they meet? How? Why? Their daughter is probably 7-8? So she was in her mid 20's when she met this old man? Don't buy it. The age gap, by their looks alone is too forced. It's strikingly obvious. Kevin Bacon has never been a hunk in any way, in my opinion, and if she is successful in her own right, why would she be with, and stay with and just SO in love with this old geriatric man. But she's cheating? I never got a clear answer on that either? How long can you pull off 2 separate phones when you've been with someone for years and years? That's some stealth ninja stuff right there. Eye roll.The scenery. Boring. Wales? Mmmk, sure. There was maybe 2 scenes, the town, and driving to the house, that could have been filmed in Wales. Everything else looked like a set, and was drab and boring.The ""bad guy"" that you see in the first 5 min of the movie in the ""bad dream""...were they trying to make it obvious it's Kevin Bacon just doing a weird voice? Thought it was very corny and far from scary.The twist? Meh. It was ok, had the movie been set up better. Why is he being punished now? Why now after at the very least a decade later is he being punished? Why is ""Stetler"" Kevin Bacon doing a weird voice? Why did he have a walker? Is he the devil? Pretty underwhelming comeuppance if you ask me.I give this movie 2 stars for the only interesting scene.

Also that plot twist, come on, now it just felt insulting, the supposed plot twist was so obvious.
I know the plot twist reveal is coming but I hope they did add something to it y'know?
Its not entirely horrid though, they managed to kept me waiting for 'something' to happened.
I like the sequence with the Room, the stairs and the house itself. The house is like a dream, nothing works logically, its disconnected but connected, nothing made sense.

It is about as creative as the car not starting when the killer is chasing you. Ditto the bit where the character looks into the mirror and his reflection does something else.The greatest thing about horror and sci-fi is that there are no bounds to what the filmmakers can create. Anything and everything is possible, permissible and encouraged.

The guy not only suffers from ugly nightmares, but he will also experience strange situations with a very modern but also very demonic house, corridors that seem to multiply, endless lights that operate alone, loss of sense of time, doors that suddenly appear, leading to rare habitats or rooms that measure more on the inside than the outside.

In fact it does many things very good and a couple of things perfectly. It just leads me to believe that the people who downvoted it either prefer bloodbath horrors (which this is not) or pretentious cinematographic drivel with no actual meaning (which this is also not). If you are looking for an actually good horror with psychological scares, look no further.As far as the acting goes, the cast does a stellar job. Perhaps the kid is a bit on the annoying side with some atypical lines but aside from that it gets high marks across the board. The pacing is done just right. It manages to set things up without putting people to sleep and then gradually escalates the tension.Where this movie truly shines is in the horror elements. There's no slimy, toothy monster that goes ""oogabooga!"", nor a jumpscare-y ghost that constantly lurks off-camera waiting for a chance to scream in your ear. Instead the horror here is built on a breaking reality as it manages to blur the line of what is real and what is imagined. Doors loop back to places on different floors, the house measured from inside is much larger than when measured from the outside, minor changes in the background, just enough to make you wonder did the characters do that or is it...? While in most horror films the cast is expected to make a series of absolutely braindead choices to get the movie going, this one traps you and even the most rational can imagine that they will remain trapped. And that is the point of the movie - You cannot escape your own demons. The ending could have in fact been better, but even as is, I am not too disappointed.So granted, this is no Triangle, but it does a nicely polished job, while staying fairly simple.

The devil is so pointless in all of it and yet he's kind of the main drive behind the plot. There's no bad acting, just a bit of a flimsy story.

218,drforeman,"A Stir of Nothing. No, wait... The Hollow Movie!",3,22 June 2020,"David Koepp's output has some soaring highs (Jurassic Park! Spider-Man!) and some abysmal lows (Jurassic Park 2! Indiana Jones 4!). This one falls into the latter category, I'm afraid. It contains the seed of something great, but it's all setup and no delivery.First, let's get this out of the way: yes, there are some great moments, and yes, they're all in the trailer. Seen the trailer? Good, you don't need to go any farther. There's nowhere to go, really... those intriguing scenes aren't leading up to anything. There's a mystery of sorts, but you'll work it out pretty quickly. The final picture that emerges isn't so much a rich tapestry as it is taped together from photocopies of other, better pictures.I really wanted to love it, because the idea of the house is a fantastic visual premise. I suspect that's how the movie was born: Koepp envisioned this place with mysterious, unreliable geometry and wrote a story to go with it. Even the execution of that idea, though, is disappointing. The movie seems to be gearing up to bring us a mind-boggling, infinitely complex setting, but it never gets there. Most of what we are shown is well done, but it doesn't go nearly far enough, re-using too many of the same sets, and ultimately falling back on well-worn dingy cellar imagery and uninspired black walls that feel like a cop-out when they arrive. The movie the trailer prepared you for seems tantalizingly close but you never reach it.The story that's loosely written around the location doesn't take up the slack. Like the house, it promises more than it delivers. The actors are too good and the characters' setup too portentous for the damp fizzle that eventually plays out. There are some odd dramatic choices. Without spoiling anything, the subplot of the wife's secret is completely out of place. Instead of upping the emotional stakes or being an effective red herring, it just confuses the tone and the way the audience relates to the characters. It feels like padding in every sense: narrative, emotional, and durational, and its awkward inclusion just exposes the thinness of the overall plot.The usual Blumhouse treatment does the movie no favors. The punctuating of every shadow and jump scare with a loud noise or music cue, the ominous scoring regardless of context, the metaphorical billboards reading ""this is a scary movie,"" usually perfect for the production company's gloriously unashamed spookfests, all seem too blatant and unsubtle for this script. Then again, maybe that's me expecting more than it ever intended to deliver. When the mystery of the house is solved, the often-used premise seems like it would be more at home in an anthology series than a deadly serious, emotionally heavy film, and maybe that was the intent all along. Perhaps the production simply leaned too heavily on striking a somber tone when the material was more akin to an episode of The Twilight Zone than Sophie's Choice.",You Should Have Left

But it had no worthwhile story.Update: I've now looked more into the story behind this movie, and I like it more now. The story that I said was too far-fetched was far-fetched on purpose to see how a writer can make an audience go along for the ride (it was originally a novel).

230,thefreneticist,Good quality geomantic/psych/diabolic horror for those who like the niche,8,24 June 2020,"""An ant doesn't know what a cathedral is...""I can see why this one has so many unimpressed reviews, it's a pretty specialist piece. Basically, it plays like a love letter to Mark Z. Danielewski's immortal genre-bending modern philosophical classic of semiotic arcana (now try saying *that* ten times quickly) novel/dossier, ""House Of Leaves"".
That one's pretty esoteric, and so is this film, in the same vein.
Few people know House Of Leaves - even among horror lit geeks, it's distinctly obscure - and even fewer liked it. But those who like it, *love* it.
This film is for them.This is a mentally twisty, physically non-Euclidian nightmare about marriage, love, guilt and redemption. If it pings as anything, if you had to put a single label on it, you could probably call it a gothic horror - though very much a firmly *modern* interpretation.The characters' rich and morally complex internal lives are explored, the nuances and often struggles of romantic commitment are highlighted, and parental love is the absolute centrepiece around which the rest of the drama turns. Indeed, this horror is one which (much like the first 20 minutes of Stephanie) touches on the uniquely chilling nature of the specific fears exclusive to those viewers with children; the vulnerable babe innocently wandering into the woods, while those who would give their lives to protect them are shut out of any control, helpless to intervene in the terrible passion play to which they are forced to bear witness.
If for nothing else than that, this film will move some viewers to horror more deeply than others.As for the acting, it's good - the players deliver rich, complicated performances that are deeply satisfying if undeniably uncomfortable to watch, but then one expects such from veteran Bacon, and to waste words on repeating the litany of his talents would be gilding the lily, so I wo't bother.More refreshingly, even the anime-eyed and lissome Amanda Seyfried gets a chance in this flick to prove to objectifying viewers that she's so much more than eye candy, as she throws down the mike with a portrayal of a loving mother and still-very-much-attracted young ""trophy"" wife at a personal crossroads between superego and id; between the fruit on the branch that's tantalisingly within reach and all there is to lose in eating it.
The portrait she paints is vibrant with a certain emotional *fierceness*, in the veracity of the love she feels for both her husband and daughter, belied with an unexpected fragility beneath the passion and bravado - some sort of brittle-bright intensity undercutting the romance of that commitment, and imbuing the character with some unmistakably sharp edges which any one of the countless less talented actresses of her particular early-00s-high-school-movies origin would struggle to reconcile in a way that made the character seem anything more than simply bipolar.
The moral convolution of this vivacious but damaged woman counterintuitively works to make her seem *more* sympathetic, rather than less so. She is challenging, and even reprehensible, but never entirely unlikable (though of course YMMV).And little Avery Tiiu Essex, playing their *very* small daughter, packs a lot of dramatic punch for her early age; she is by turns meltingly tender, heartbreakingly innocent, breathtakingly perceptive (playing very much against the common adult trope that children are oblivious), and, on occasion, shrilly exuberant to the point of annoyance - in other words, an actual child, in all its sweet, demanding, messy glory, as opposed to the one-note performances so often seen from actors so young (after all, acting is a skill, like any other, and skills *do* generally take time to acquire).
This portrait, so naturalistic, puts your heart all the deeper and more firmly into your throat for the danger she finds herself besieged by.
Your can't help but invest in her, and in the mutually-besotted (with her, at least) adults to whom she has become such a blessing.This is not simply a horror movie - or rather, it is not *only* a horror movie; it is also a domestic drama, a paternal love story, an examination of the lies we tell ourselves to maintain our self-image, and a thesis, ultimately, upon forgiveness and sacrifice.
It's *also* one Hell of a horror movie, for those into a very neglected niche. For most others, it will fly over their heads (no judgement in that assessment, by the way; no one thing is for everyone).If you loved the Escher-room quest scene in Labyrinth, this will send your submarine positively skyward.Expect cult status to follow.",You Should Have Left

I wonder what those dissatisfied with this movie would think about works like Hitchcock's, ""The Birds"" or Mann's literary work, ""Doctor Faustus.""In my boomer opinion (64 yrs.-old), this movie is well worth the watch. I think it even rates as excellent. The direction and cinematography are better than I've seen in a long time (and by that, I don't mean just the beauty of the setting and the spectacular sets). The imagery is spot-on to the storyline; it's edgy and haunting without being a distraction. But that's not why I'd recommend it.

The concept of this film sounded interesting, the plot didn't sound bad at all. However, the execution of it is one of the worst I've seen this year so far. Nothing really thrilling or exciting happens throughout the duration of the film as it turns more into a drama and mystery than a horror film.The three main characters have little common sense to the point it'll leave you frustrated at certain points throughout the film. There's a scene where Theo and his daughter Ella attempt to leave the house, only to ""return"" there a little while after, knowingly putting themselves back in danger.The overall message from 'You Should Have Left' is that you have to live up to the things you've done and you can't escape your own shadow. Or is it? Maybe I'm just searching too deep for an explanation after the cluttered conclusion to make myself feel better. This is what I believe the film-makers were trying to express anyway, however, it's sloppy and unclear. The ending of the film still leaves a lot of open questions.'You Should Have Left' is slow paced, confusing, lacks tension & atmosphere and has no sense of direction. I found myself hoping for a surprise ending, a shocking twist or turn but was left just feeling more confused at the end. It seems to me that both Kevin Bacon & Amanda Seyfried didn't read the script and wanted an easy payday on this one.I recommend skipping this film and reading the book if the plot interests you. I haven't read it, nor do I plan on doing so, but it can't be any worse than this production.It's rare that I have to share my thoughts and opinions on a movie's age rating and certification. However, the UK rating from the BBFC seems to have been skewed for 'You Should Have Left'.UK: Rated 18 for strong injury detail - this is legitimately all that is available on the official BBFC website. This rating makes absolutely no sense. There is no content in this film that constitutes an 18 rating. This should be rated 15 and a weak 15 at that. The only explanation that I can come up with for this is that BBFC have rated it so highly to stop younger teens from seeing this sleep-fest. If that's the case, then I tip my hat.US: Rated R for some violence, disturbing images, sexual content and language - this is a more accurate age rating which constitutes a 15 rating in the UK. The content they've outlined here is more accurate of that in the film and you should use this as a benchmark.",You Should Have Left

Kevin Bacon and Amanda Seyfried were interesting to watch, held my attention, and played there parts well. The little girl (I don't know her name), was also a plus. The house the movie takes place in is very unique and adds to the mystery and visual appeal of the movie.

Most notably, they stole ideas from Mark Z. Danielewski's House of Leaves. Many people have been begging for an adaptation of that book and I came here to see if he finally worked out a deal, after seeing the scene where Kevin Bacon measures the inside and outside of the house. I was disappointed to see this Daniel Kehlmann person is claiming credit for the creepy house with regular doors that lead into a dark, nightmare realm. The maniacal writings, which seem out of place in the movie, were also stolen from House of Leaves.

Where this movie looses points is it seems to be a reimagining of The House of Leaves (Released in 2000) by Mark Z. Danielewski. The premise is too similar to be a coincidence and even some of the audio (the self help narration) could be a direct replacement for Anne Danielewsi's album Haunted.

This movie scared the heck out of me and kept my adrenaline high the whole time, my finace was scared as well, we are huge horror buffs and this is the first movie in a long time that actually scared us.Little girl was phenominal, its wonderful to finally see a good horror movie with good acting - its been a while, Kevin Bacon, amazing as always, stir of echos scared me as a child this was even better. Wish he did more horrors honestly hes great at it. How anyone didnt like this movie is beyond me? I hineslty feel like some people just have such crappy lives that they dont enjoy anything.

348,danidott,Bad even for free,1,20 June 2020,"I had a free rental credit and used it on this. I can't imagine paying for it.
The script was bad, no character development and awkward lines.
The acting was horrible, by everyone in the cast. I would say the best actor was maybe the store clerk.
Absolutely no chemistry between Amanda Seyfried and Kevin Bacon. It was very uncomfortable to watch them together. I really like both actors which is why I decided to watch the movie, but all I kept thinking was should I turn this off or wait for the ending to see if it improves. I chose the latter and that was a bad choice.
The only good thing was that the movie was only 1 hour and 33 minutes long. I really appreciate the fact that they didn't make it any longer.",You Should Have Left

356,linamoet,You Should Not Have Watched This Film,4,12 March 2021,"Oh how I wish I would remember to check if ageing but wealthy actors are producers on their own films. Up came the credits and all was explained. Not a great deal to explain in the film, which is a mish-mash of various horror tropes from The Shining to every other low budget horror film you've ever seen. And with that grammar I don't mean The Shining was low budget, I mean YSHL is low budget. Which I also don't mean to be an insult, but this movie is some sort of insult. Not even to our intelligence because I was dumb enough to watch it. As I write I'm starting to feel that four stars was generous but really, there's so little to recommend this. I for one am bored of stories about a) rich people and their problems, b) actors and their problems, c) thinly veiled metaphors for ageing, no, scratch that, *any* Hollywood people and their problems.

Knowing that he pretty much gets to choose what he wants to play in, I thought that it would have a better plot or even a twist at the end, which it kind of did, but was it was a little subpar.I loved Stir of Echoes and thought this might be something along the lines of that one. But this one was a little tame, to be honest. When I first saw it advertised, it was as a ""psychological thriller"" but the next time, it was listed as a ""horror."" I'd say it's more along the lines of a suspense thriller, in the fact that you are on the edge of your seat, not knowing where it's going to go. In no way would I describe it as a ""horror"" because it's too tame for that classification.All that being said, it's not a bad movie. It's just not the best. The scariest parts of the movie were all pretty much shown in the trailer. I'd watch it again if it came on TV, but I wouldn't go out and buy it to add to my collection.",You Should Have Left

368,gabrose5,A decent psychological thriller,6,19 June 2020,"The acting was meh, the writing was meh, but I loved loved loved the camera work. Straight lines/angles on screen and focused reflections and stark depth of field stuff, all relating to the movies story now that I think back on it. Simple yet impressive light effects.I loved Stir of Echoes so I wanted to give this one a try, and this one kind of emulates that same ""what's actually going on here?"" theme that most psychological thriller's seem to have. While this movie didn't have great story pacing as Stir of Echoes did, it still held my attention fairly well. It got a bit confusing late in the 3rd act but the very ending cleared it up enough. Confusing to the point of almost hating the movie lol! But the last few lines worked well and made me go, ""Ohhhhhh, that's what it meant..."" so it wasn't as bad as it could've been.ALSO - Those are some major red flags for an AirBnB when multiple townsfolk are raising their eyebrows at you staying there, right?!I'd recommend it if you liked Stir of Echoes and enjoy Kevin Bacon, and if you like good camera work. Honestly the cinematography saved it for me.6/10",You Should Have Left
369,katherine-bernardi1,Great idea- poor ending,7,2 August 2020,"As a horror movie fan, and film school graduate, Im very forgiving of horror movies. I know how hard it is to come up with a new idea, something that isnt over played. The beginning starts out strong, its watchable, interesting, good premise. Good acting, and it all just falls apart at the end. All of it, even the acting. The last scene, Amanda Seyfried looks at her husband and just nods 'ok' when he says he has to stay. No questions, no fight, no anything. Even his daughter just looks down. Im sorry, but if my husband told me he just killed someone and was staying in some hell house, id have a lot more reaction. That aside, it could have been a really great movie, but the ending just killed it. It fell apart so fast, I was shocked. As soon as they start walking outside, it becomes a illogical mess. Is it worth a watch? yes. It's better than most junk these days. Does it deserve an award? no way. Will I watch it again? No. I feel like had more effort been devoted to the last quarter, it could have been a great movie. It's an original idea, great actors and unfortunately had bad last half screen writing.",You Should Have Left
