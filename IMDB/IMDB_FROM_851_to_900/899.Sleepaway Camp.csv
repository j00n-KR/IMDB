0,Leofwine_draca,What an ending!,5,6 February 2015,"Let's face it, SLEEPAWAY CAMP isn't a great slasher movie. Despite being heavily indebted to the likes of Friday THE 13TH and THE BURNING, it's not half as good: the production values are pretty poor, the script is pretty lunk-headed, and the characters just don't grip you like in some other movies.In addition, the movie is cheesy in the extreme, with the kill scenes involving such improbable methods as somebody getting a bee's nest thrown into their cubicle while they're on the toilet. It's all frankly rather laughable, although not without merit for those with a soft spot for '80s nostalgia. Certainly the fashions and the style of film-making readily date this to the early '80s.However, things do turn around for an infamous twist ending which, I have to say, is one of the most simple and yet effective that I've ever seen. I thought Argento did similar twists well in the likes of PHENOMENA but the twist in SLEEPAWAY CAMP is superlative, closing on one of the most chilling freeze-frames I've ever witnessed. It really is that good; a shame that the rest of the film couldn't rise to the same level.",Sleepaway Camp
1,SnoopyStyle,creepy and weird,6,4 January 2020,"It's Camp Arawak. Little Angela loses her family in a boating accident. Eight years later, Angela is living with her quirky aunt Dr. Martha Thomas and her son Ricky. She sends Angela and Ricky to Camp Arawak. Angela is quiet and tends to stare. The popular girls don't like her. She's almost molested by the creepy cook when she's saved by Ricky. The cook is attacked in a corny way. The camp owner keeps the incident quiet. Ricky gets into a fight with the jocks. Paul is taken with Angela.The acting is strictly amateurish. There are no A-listers in waiting. It's really campy at times. Some of acting is very broad. The creepy cook is super creepy. The wacky aunt is super wacky. I do like the camp owner's deteriorating craziness. Angela is weird in an unreal way. This is camp. It's pure camp in that everybody is trying but they are failing slightly. Sometimes they're trying too hard. It's fitting that the first attack happens with a lot of corn. As for the killer's identity, it seems obvious as soon as the girl commented on the shower issue. It's a matter of whether the movie was willing to go there. It goes there.",Sleepaway Camp
2,claudio_carvalho,Surprising Ending,5,24 June 2020,"A family is destroyed by a speedboat in a lake nearby a camp. Eight years later, the outcast teenager Angela (Felissa Rose), who survived the accident and was raised by her nutty Aunt Martha (Desiree Gould), travels with her protective cousin Ricky (Jonathan Tierston) to spend vacation in the Arawak Camp owned by Mel (Mike Kellin). Soon the pervert cook of the camp has a tragic accident in the kitchen that is followed by the death of several teenagers and kids. Who might be the killer?""Sleepaway Camp"" is a campy American slasher that is worthwhile watching because of the surprising ending. The plot is silly and the acting is terrible (Aunt Martha is laughable so bad it is) and becomes funny for the viewer. But the last scene turns the movie into a cult for horror fans. My vote is five.Title (Brazil): ""Acampamento Sinistro"" (""Sinister Camp"")",Sleepaway Camp
3,gavin6942,One of the Very Best Slashers of the Early 1980s,7,20 October 2010,"Slightly disturbed and painfully shy Angela Baker (Felissa Rose) is sent away to summer camp with her foul-mouthed cousin Ricky Thomas (Jonathan Tiersten). Not long after Angela's arrival, things start to go horribly wrong for anyone with sinister or less than honorable intentions.This film is either loved or hated, and with good reason, but it has been embraced more and more as the years go on by fans of the horror genre. The acting is excessively cheesy, especially from Desiree Gould, but purposely so. The kills are grisly and nasty, even if not always shown on screen. When that curling iron strikes, you know the situation. And the pedophile cook? Oh man... that is pushing boundaries that even horror films dare not cross (Freddy Krueger can be a child killer, but not a child molester).One cannot vouch for the next two sequels, which have little connection to this film, but the original stands as a true modern classic, and if you have not seen it, you are really missing out on an important piece of horror history. What could have been a ripoff of other horror slashers that take place at camp (notably ""Friday the 13th"") turns out to be far different from any other title out there. And keep in mind the whole crew, more or less, had just come from ""Creepshow"", so these were folks who knew what they were doing.Writer-director Robert Hiltzik (who graduated NYU with Ang Lee) mysteriously went decades without directing again. Many of the actors also never acted again, at least for a long time. And then you have Christopher Collet, going on to make such things as ""Prayer of the Rollerboys""... does that make him the biggest success from this film?Not only does the film get better with repeated viewings (which make the humor and camp more fun), but there are actually some clever subplots that will likely be missed on the first time or two. Mel Kostic (portrayed wonderfully by the late Mike Kellin) not only is one of the best characters, but has his own story and relationship with the campers and counselors that may not be immediately evident.The Scream Factory Blu-ray is ridiculously good and worth owning. Beyond the excellent presentation, it has three different audio commentaries, where you learn odd trivia like Felissa Rose's husband Deron Miller meeting her as a fan, and much more. There is even a short film showing whatever happened to Judy (although it is not very good).",Sleepaway Camp
4,lee_eisenberg,"there's a lot to be said about movies with ""sleep"" in the title",9,29 May 2006,"Contrary to how it may appear, ""Sleepaway Camp"" is not just another litany of guts getting torn out. For starters, there's the ending; I sure as hell didn't see that coming! But beyond that, you do actually get a feel for the characters throughout the movie - particularly after what happens at the beginning - and there are some creative murders (does it make me an awful person for saying that?). As main character Angela, Felissa Rose creates a girl with whom we can all identify. The rest of the characters gravitate between bitchy and asking-for-it...you'll know what I mean if you see the movie. A pretty cool flick.Also, I wonder: what is it about movies with ""sleep"" in the title? There's this one, but many different kinds accompany it: ""Sleeping Beauty"", ""Sleeper"" and ""Sleepers"", to name a few. It's just something to think about the next time that you go to sleep. But will you be able to after watching this movie?",Sleepaway Camp
5,Woodyanders,A deliciously sick and deviant early 80's summer camp slasher flick,8,3 January 2007,"Shy, repressed teenage girl Angela (winningly played by Felissa Rose) makes her first trip to Camp Arawak with her nephew Ricky (the solid Jonathan Tiersten). Several mean teens at the camp start to mercilessly pick on Angela. Before you can say ""here we go again,"" the body count starts to mount, with a handful of folks getting bumped off in assorted gruesome ways. Could it be Angela or someone else who's committing these horrible murders? While the basic plot is obviously derived both ""Carrie"" and ""Friday the 13th"" alike, this satisfyingly grim early 80's low-budget slice'n'dice item still cuts it as good'n'ghoulish slasher fun thanks to Robert Hiltzik's strong direction and a suitably sick, perverse and twisted script. Moreover, this movie plausibly depicts adolescents as cruel, selfish and fiercely competitive little monsters. The make-up f/x by Ed French are top-notch and each grisly murder is creative in its own macabre way: A portly, repulsive pedophile cook has his face severely burned with scalding hot water, a jerk drowns under a boat, another dork is stung to death by wasps, a bimbo gets knifed in the shower, a vicious floozy's face gets roasted by an electric curling iron, three kids are hacked up with a hatchet, and the same hatchet is used for a decapitation. WARNING: Major *SPOILER* ahead. Plus there's one startling doozy of a shock surprise ending: Angela turns out to be a boy who was raised by his wacko aunt (delightfully overplayed to the campy wacko hilt by Desiree Gould) to believe that he's a girl instead. This conclusion was later shamelessly copied in ""The Crying Game."" Craggy-faced character actor Mike Kellin turns in a fine performance as Mel, the irate, cigar-chomping camp owner who tries to cover up the murders and ultimately winds up having an arrow shot through his neck. This nasty nugget was followed by two entertaining tongue-in-cheek sequels, but the original remains the best of the bunch.",Sleepaway Camp
6,BA_Harrison,"Yes, it has a memorable ending... but what about the rest of the film?",5,9 February 2007,"Having watched what I have now discovered to be a cut release of Sleepaway Camp, I wasn't entirely sure that it was fair to write a comment based on an 'incomplete' movie. However, after checking the exact contents of the cuts (a little nudity, some swearing and a tiny bit of gore) I am pretty sure that my opinion of the film would remain the same: it's undoubtedly a memorable movie, thanks to its its lurid plot and shock ending, but it still failed to impress me as much as I had hoped.Felissa Rose plays Angela, the only survivor of a boating accident, who goes to live with crazy Aunt Martha and cousin Ricky. Angela grows up shy and quiet, and, when sent to summer camp with Ricky, refuses to join in with the fun and games. The victim of bullying, Angela refuses to speak, until a young lad, Paul, makes the effort to communicate. But with a homicidal maniac on the loose, does Angela's new relationship really stand a chance?Director and writer, Robert Hiltzik, has the basic ingredients for a good shockeran unusual set of characters, some reasonable effects, and a handful of particularly repellent moments (which include a paedophile trying his luck with Angela, a gay sex scene witnessed by young children, a death scene featuring curling tongs put to use in a very nasty manner, and THAT ending), but with a pretty poor cast spouting some lousy dialogue, and rather lacklustre direction, the movie struggles to maintain momentum between the 'good' bits.Sleepaway Camp is worth watching if you're a horror completist, or if you wish to see one of the most bizarre end scenes of all time, but it really amounts to nothing more than a fairly enjoyable entry in the stalk 'n' slash sub-genre.",Sleepaway Camp
7,Quinoa1984,"sure it's not very well acted or written, but... it's got something",6,23 August 2009,"Sleepaway Camp, we see before the credits roll, is dedicated to the director's mother. I wonder if she had already passed on before the making of little Robert Hiltzik's grand opus of cruelty. This is kind of a sadistic movie when it comes down to it, even as it's also a cheap and so-so acted slasher movie (I say so-so since some performances stand out as AWESOME camp, while others... well, wait till you see the Aunt early on). It's simply about a camp of the title, where young Angela and her cousin are sent away for the summer, and poor Angela, who is meek and not well adjusted around most people and keeps her mouth shut if she doesn't have something to say to someone positive to her, is picked on mercilessly. There's a guy who does take an interest in her, but is that even for real? And what's with all of these murders that just so happen to all be connected to her, and why doesn't she seem to blink much at all, and...OK, it might sound like I gave away a big spoiler, but it's not like the director tries to hide it either. Hiltzik goes to lengths to give a couple of grisly-cum-creative scenes, such as a pedophile cook (that is one nasty SOB by the way) who gets his just dessert with a giant pot of boiling water on his body and face, or the head of the camp himself getting an arrow right through the neck. Other deaths are more just ho-hum like a slash through a shower or a little trick with a hair iron. If you're watching the film just for that, it delivers decently. And if you're looking for lame-o early 80s slasher dialog there's some of that too. But more than likely if you're just watching the movie for the twist, it'll seem like a longer wait, and a strange one.It's one of those rare slasher flicks where its actually up-front with us about what's going on, and makes it a (if I can say such for this movie) study of the horror of a tragedy on a young person and constant bullying from kids. But this up-front quality, after some thought once the movie ends, is also a cover too. We're literally thrown into that last ""MONEY"" shot, so to speak, that has had fans of the movie talking for years, and it ultimately builds up to something that is far more traumatic and psychologically terrifying than anything the movie has (mostly) come to grips with for most of its running time. Instead Sleepaway Camp is a deranged mix of campy comedy and really screwed up chick-flick-gone-sour movie. Which, sometimes, isn't totally uncalled for on a Sunday afternoon or with friends and some beers.",Sleepaway Camp
8,BandSAboutMovies,Just...yeah...wow,7,31 May 2018,"Let's take a trip back to 1975, when John Baker and his boyfriend Lenny took John's kids on a boating trip. Those kids are madcap scamps that capsize their dad's boat for fun. But on the swim back to shore, a waterskier kills John and his son Peter, leaving Angela traumatized.Eight years later, Angela is living with her weird aunt Dr. Martha Thomas (who would be able to unite Superman and Batman, based on her first name), along with her cousin Ricky. They go to Camp Arawak for the summer. As someone who has never been to summer camp, nor ever wanted to go, I fail to see the fun that places like this promise.Angela gets bullied at every turn, even when the counselors try to help her. And to top it off, the head cook even tries to rape her. Sure, he's soon scalded by hot water. But it seems odd how many people have it in for this little girl. I guess the good news is that everyone that screws with her dies horribly - if that can be good news. Like Kenny, a kid that mocks her. She also finally gets a friend, Paul, who has the hots for her.As Paul and Angela attend a movie at the camp, two of the boys throw water balloons at them. Billy, one of the throwers, is soon killed by bees. At this point, Mel, the owner, starts to realize that maybe there's a killer in the camp.Paul tries to kiss Angela, but she has a flashback to catching her father in bed with Lenny. Oh no! And it gets worse, as Judy - one of the worst behaved girls - kisses Paul and then throws Angela into the water. Ricky saves her, only for a bunch of kids to throw sand in her face! Will the torment ever end?The film then descends into slasher film madness. Meg, a counselor who is sleeping with the owner of the camp, a man nearly fifty years or more her senior, is killed in the shower. The kids who threw sand at Angela? Nearly all of them are dispensed of with a hatchet. And the evil Judy? She's raped with a hot curling iron (!) and smothered with a pillow, which feels like the roughest and softest kill ever. And finally, the owner of the camp blames Ricky and attacks him, only for the real killer to shoot him with an arrow.The police come to investigate the murders while Paul and Angela decide to go skinny dipping. Two of the counselors find them and we learn that she has decapitated Paul and jumps up, fully nude and fully a dude, making a hissing sound and looking like a complete maniac. The truth? Angela is really Peter, the boy we thought died in the opening. Dr. Martha had raised him as the daughter she never got to have..It's funny. In the early 80's, so many people bemoaned how many slashers were playing in theaters and drive-ins. But today, we're lucky to get a horror film into theaters. And truly odd films, like Sleepaway Camp, go direct to streaming or DVD. Let's face it - none of today's films are as goofy as this either. And by goofy, I don't mean the SyFy or Troma movies that are made to be dumb. No, this is a film that appears to be an attempt at a legitimate, serious film that ends up being something wonderful crazy. It's filled with ridiculous dialogue, over the top murders and that ending!",Sleepaway Camp
9,Coventry,Too young to slash?,4,21 February 2006,"I'll definitely be the first to admit that this ""Sleepaway Camp"" contains some really ingenious plot ideas and several very grisly images but, regretfully, NONE of these promising elements were processed the way they should have. This might very well be one of the most successful ""Friday the 13th""-clones of the early 80's (maybe even better than F13 itself) but still all that remains is a poorly produced and clumsily shot horror movie with more bad aspects than good ones. Many fans of the horror genre put ""Sleepaway Camp"" among their favorites because of the exceptional plot twist at the end of the film. Granted, the notorious climax is rather inventive and sick, but also very predictable, especially if you anticipate some kind of out-of-the-ordinary plot twist (and we all know there will be a twist, don't we?). Moreover, this ""terrific"" denouement is preceded by 80 long minutes of clichéd situations, imbecile dialogs and absolutely awful acting performances! Several years after a traumatizing boating accident, young and silent Angela is sent to summer camp where she's the victim of bullying and vicious laughingstock. Strangely enough, everyone who messes with Angela ends up sadistically murdered. As you can see, the subject matter is very routine and not even the most shocking climax can possibly turn ""Sleepaway Camp"" into a good film. Still, there are some unique and hugely disturbing aspects about ""Sleepaway Camp"" that are rarely ever mentioned but stand as the only reason why this 80's slasher is memorable, in my humble opinion. The murder victims in this film are the youngest ever! They hardly even hit puberty if you ask me! The boy who loses his head, for example, is just a child and even the irritating Judy character is way too young to be killed off like this (even though she proudly shows off with her perky pubertal breasts). There also are serious insinuations towards pedophilia and a sexual relationship between the camp owner and a female teenager that are way too controversial for a film like this. Odd little horror movie, to say the least",Sleepaway Camp
10,Hey_Sweden,You're just what I've been looking for...,8,31 May 2014,"It's not surprising that ""Sleepaway Camp"" would have the reputation that it has. It's decidedly more twisted than most slashers, and is more than simply a ""Friday the 13th"" ripoff. It manages to combine some potent mean-spiritedness with some highly amusing bits. Its kills result in some effectively graphic mayhem, but display some ingenuity, particularly the bit with the wasps' nest. Its characters are quite memorable, and you certainly don't ever forget the imagery of that big revelation at the end.After tragedy befalls her family, Angela Baker (Felissa Rose) comes to live with her cousin Ricky (Jonathan Tiersten) and whack job aunt Martha (Desiree Gould). Eight years after the incident, Ricky and the reserved, tight-lipped Angela go to Camp Arawak for the summer. Soon after they get there, nasty fates are in store for staff and campers alike. Antagonists Judy (Karen Fields) and Meg (Katherine Kamhi) make life miserable for Angela while Ricky goes about earning the title of most foul mouthed kid in attendance.This is the kind of movie about which it's best not to say too much so newcomers can fully appreciate the creepiness that writer / director / executive producer Robert Hiltzik has in store for them. Even the little kids attending the camp are fair game for our killer, whose nastiness is impressive, especially in the cringe inducing curling iron murder. Edward Frenchs' makeup effects are very good (get a load of that convincing arrow through the throat gag), and the music by Edward Bilous is pretty damn scary. The acting is actually solid from much of the cast; even minor characters like Martha and sicko cook Artie (Owen Hughes) leave an impression with minimal screen time. Fields and Kamhi, two very nice women in real life, are amazing as the two bitches of the piece. Rose is good in the central role, and the late, great character actor Mike Kellin, as camp director Mel, is wonderful as always; Mel turned out to be his final film role.This is pretty much essential viewing for new fans of the late 1970s and 1980s slasher craze.Eight out of 10.",Sleepaway Camp
11,preppy-3,OK but way too grim,6,24 June 2008,"Ricky (Jonathan Tiersten) and quiet cousin Angela (Felissa Rose) attend summer camp together. Angela won't talk until nice handsome Paul (Christopher Collet) talks to her and makes her feel welcome. However there are also somebody murdering people in the camp. Who is it and why are they doing it? This has a HUGE cult following. It bombed on its initial release but developed a strong following on video and led to multiple sequels. It's not a bad movie but I can't see why it's such a big hit. It's VERY grim in tone (the teasing of Angela borders on sadistic) and has very few murders. The acting is pretty bad too with the sole exceptions of Rose, Tiersten and especially Collet. The murders themselves are bloody but cut down to nothing (the MPAA really went after this one). I also saw the ""twist"" at the end coming a mile away. It does end on a very disturbing shot also. But, all in all, I found this too unpleasant and badly acted to like. I give it a 6.",Sleepaway Camp
12,Boba_Fett1138,Real camp B-horror.,6,8 May 2009,"This movie is kind of slow and it's also really a B-type of movie but yet the manages to be not completely horrible. It's a pretty maintaining movie that features all of the right required ingredients and also throws in some originality of its own.Even though it is of course a quite formulaic movie they still did a pretty good job with its story. This is mostly because it picks a pretty nice approach with its killer. Problem is perhaps that the movie has too many slow and pointless moments in it and it also starts to repeat itself a bit at times. It also doesn't always handle its character well enough. Sometimes a character gets put down as a carrying main character but then he or she will suddenly disappear out of the movie again for quite some time. The movie has some difficulties finding its right balance at times.It's a movie that has B-movie written all over it. It has a campy look and its silly '80's atmosphere and look of course also don't help much. But foremost the movie is a real B-movie with its acting. The movie has some real bad acting in it, also due to the fact that most characters are being played by inexperienced teenagers. But somehow it also really seems to fit the movie and it hardly becomes a big complaint while watching the movie. It helps to make the movie a more light and entertaining one to watch.The movie still takes itself serious though, so the movie is no ridicules one to watch. It has swearing and gore in it but nothing that will impress the most hardened horror movie watcher too much, though it's all still good looking.The movie tends to become a real slasher toward the end and perhaps also feels a bit rushed, since it's in contrast with its more slower first halve. It's not really a problem though, since it actually provides the movie with some good genre moments and a great ending.Certainly watchable, especially of course if you know how to appreciate an '80's B-movie.6/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Sleepaway Camp

It's got a reputation as having one of the most shocking twist endings in horror movie history, and I will say I did not see the twist coming at all. It's not a scary movie at all, and I'm not even sure it was really trying to be. For that reason, though it's clearly modeled after ""Friday the 13th,"" it's not really a rival to that movie, as it has a completely different tone and sensibility.

First off, after the initial flashback at the start of the movie, has to be the worst five minutes of acting by anyone i have seen on screen.

This movie is also not very good, if you like it fine, but it just is not my thing.  For one I did not find the ending all that shocking as I saw it coming even as a kid (let's face it, the movie shows you clearly who survived the crash).  This movie is the typical slasher for the most part, with a person being killed here and there.  If you like slashers it would probably be worth checking out.  As for me, I just can not believe how high the ranking of this is here.  This site is notorious for being hard on horror films yet this one has a somewhat good score.  I don't know, to me it just wasn't anything all that special, even if you couldn't figure out the ending and it was a surprise, there was more to the movie than that.  This one also tries to be funny here and there and it fails, I absolutely hated the mother's performance and she isn't even in the movie much.  I am betting the sequels were not much better.

19,Wuchakk,Adolescents at a summer camp in upstate New York... with a killer on the loose,6,23 July 2019,"On the surface ""Sleepaway Camp"" (1983) is a clone of the first two ""Friday the 13th"" movies (1980/1981) mixed with elements of ""Meatballs"" (1979), but with more edge. Like the first ""Friday the 13th,"" the killer is a mystery until the end. Like ""Meatballs,"" the youths at the camp are adolescents, including pubescents. Kids of this ilk didn't manifest in the Friday the 13th franchise until Part VI (1986) and, even then, they weren't the focus.Unfortunately, the production values are subpar compared to the above films. If you take out the cussing and slayings, this is of the TV movie variety; and I'm being nice. There's also some overt camp (no pun intended), like Ricky's mother.Still, you can't beat the early 80's ambiance and the styles are amusing, especially the short shorts worn by guys. Unlike most of the ""Friday"" flicks or ""The Burning"" (1981), the killer doesn't wear a mask; and ""Sleepaway Camp"" gets extra points for a shockingly perverse revelation at the climax. There are several other gems, like Judy's full black mane (Karen Fields), Meg's curious attraction to the older curmudgeonly camp owner and Paul DeAngelo's impressive fitness & laughable shorts.The film runs 1 hour, 24 minutes; and was shot in in Argyle, New York, near Summit Lake at a camp formerly named Camp Algonquin.GRADE: B-/C+",Sleepaway Camp
20,The_Void,One of the better 'lower-key' slashers,8,28 December 2005,"Sleepaway Camp is one of the most clear-cut cases of Friday the 13th mimicry in all of horror cinema. It's so clear cut because it's so shameless - we have a holiday camp, a murderer on the rampage because of something that happened at the start of the film, a completely unlikely killer etc etc; yet despite all this, Sleepaway Camp does manage to put all of these elements together to form a fairly decent slasher flick. The first half of the film won't lead you to believe this, however; as it's really quite boring, but once the film gets going, Sleepaway camp starts to justify it's reputation as one of the best of the non-Friday/Elm Street slasher films. The plot is a simple excuse for lots of butchery, and sees a camping holiday turn to tragedy as a father and child are killed in a boating accident. We then fast-forward eight years, and it's time for Ricky and his cousin; the survivor of the accident at the film's opening, to partake in the all-American tradition of spending the summer at camp. Unfortunately, a ruthless killer has decided to do the same thing...This film has been described as an essential film for horror fans; but that really isn't true. Sleepaway Camp is merely another entry in the eighties slasher tradition; and I would say that it's only worth seeing once you've run out of actual classics to watch. I do have to admit, however, that I've never been a big fan of this sort of film; so slasher fans are welcome to disagree with me. The murders here aren't all that bloodthirsty, but they are quite vicious, despite the vast majority of them happening off-screen. I do have to give credit to this film, however, for the fact that it doesn't merely go with the boring knife killings that many of its peers adhere to. Modes of dispatch include scolding, beheading, drowning and my personal favourite - the beehive! There is a knife sequence, but it's actually quite well done. This leads me to the film's ending. The ending is here is often touted as being one of the most shocking in American horror cinema history, and it's easy to see why. However, it isn't that shocking when it comes to mystery - as the twist becomes all too easy to guess at about the halfway point. Still, this certainly isn't a bad film - and while it's not essential, it's a decent way to spend eighty-odd minutes.",Sleepaway Camp
21,mm-39,Never make a film like this again!,6,4 October 2020,"Never make a film like this again! Well for today's crowd too many stereotypes, but hey sometimes art reflects reality. The murder at the camp is predictable and formulates script, but hey the character development reminds me of growing up in the ethnic blue collar part of town which reflect what I've seen growing up. Many of the Sleepaway Camp kids, trash talked, swore, talk about sex, bullied, and the usually stupid pranks which reflect the too cool growing up in the 80's decade. The boy's where behaving like there blue color dad's from the brewery, meat packing plant, steel mill etc which we all see on a Friday night. Sleepaway Camp has a real blue color feel, the accurate version of the movie mean girls crown vs the un cool gals. Things get jazzed up of course, but there is a killer with a secret, which is the plot twist of someone having an inflected personality disorder. The ending and the trash behavior make Sleepaway Camp I say better than average slasher movie. 6 stars.",Sleepaway Camp

23,christopher-underwood,I was left with a rather sour taste,6,6 November 2008,"Just caught this on the three film box-set. Never seen it before and I think I have always been put off by the UK 15 certificate suggesting a distinct lack of sex and violence. And I suppose it is peculiarly lacking in this department for an eighties slasher movie, but it disturbs nonetheless. The film is rather uneven with some very good bits and then some unbelievable bad moments, it seems for a second that neither you nor the cast can believe. And yet or perhaps because of the erratic direction we are never 100% comfortable that we know where this is going. The opening with the boating accident and the later leaving for camp 8 years later are both eerie moments and then when the film settles down we get so much bitching and bullying it is as if we have a WIP film. I do think Angela's silent staring and the constant need for her to be asked if she is OK is irritating but then, I guess, without it the film wouldn't work at all. The killings if not full and in your face are ingenious and effective. It is just that I was left with a rather sour taste in my mouth and I think that had to do with the unresolved trauma that proves to be essential to the plot.",Sleepaway Camp

26,bowmanblue,So bad it's weirdly good,7,20 June 2020,"Ever since the 'Friday 13th' movies kind of set the benchmark for what a 'horror/slasher' movie should be back in the 1980s, even to today they haven't changed that much. In 1983 'Sleepaway Camp' decided to capitalise on the genre by having a bunch of teens go to a summer camp (only not 'Crystal Camp' this time!) during school holidays and get picked off one by one.So, it's you usual 'who-dun-it' where there are all manor of weird and bizarre characters - many of which with various anti-social personality disorders - who could have snapped and decided to hack up the rest of the cast.Now, besides the fairly bog standard plot summary, I'm being rather vague about the film's story. That's because at least one of its main selling points is the overall 'twist' (if you can call it that), or rather motivation/reveal of the killer. You'll only get the one chance to watch this film without knowing anything other than it's a 'slasher' film and I recommend you don't read up on too many spoilers. Personally, I managed to guess what was going on about three quarters of the way through, but the person I watched it with was suitably shocked by the outcome.Anyway, for us seasoned horror fans, we normally want one thing from our 'Friday 13th' rip-offs - the gore. And, for a low budget film, the kills are actually pretty gruesome. That's one of the major plus points. I guess however, what they spent on make-up they saved on acting talent. I couldn't quite work out whether the actors were told to 'ham it up' in order to almost make this some sort of early 'parody' of the genre. Either way, it really gives it a laughably-funny kind of overall feel, perforated with the gruesome murders.There's not an awful lot you haven't seen here before (with the possibly exception of the final scene!) in a 'slasher' film, but, if you're into your old horror films, this one is definitely entertaining - you'll notice I use the word 'entertaining' rather than 'good.' If it is 'good' then it's definitely 'so-bad-it's-good.'",Sleepaway Camp

28,paulclaassen,"Low, low, low budget, and forgettable..",3,18 June 2020,"'Sleepaway Camp' is actually a very bad film, yet it still has a sort of charm to it. Weird...At first, I thought this would be in the vein of 'Friday the 13th' - a mindless slasher film with a bunch of hot and horny teens ready for the kill. Well, there certainly was a fair share of hot and horny teens, but it wasn't all that mindless. In fact, the murders were few and far between, and not gruesome at all. Most of the killings were rather silly, actually, to be honest.The film dishes up a good dose of eye candy, what with all those muscles and short shorts! That compensated for where the story lacked. Speaking of lacking, boy was the acting bad!! It was actually so bad that it turned out to be entertaining! The story itself was rather boring, though - most of which revolved around Angela - a girl traumatized after a freak accident 8 years ago. There's no suspense here, no scares, very few jump scares....This is not what I expected. It turned out to be a drama with a killing here and there. The film also got much worse as it progressed. And I'll say it again: such bad acting!!The twist ending is just preposterous. It explains nothing... There honestly was nothing special about this film. Not really memorable...",Sleepaway Camp

31,insomniac_rod,Objectively : the ending is what makes this movie watchable.,7,27 August 2006,"A slasher flick that has got the attention of fans of the genre mainly because of it's gruesome, shocking ending. To be honest, this is a regular Slasher flick with the usual death scenes, campy acting, cheesy gore, and clichèd characters.But also, being honest, ""Sleepaway Camp"" has a tremendously chilling and shocking ending that could only be imagined in the worst nightmares. The lullaby song... the bloody mouth... the chopped head... the expression on Angela's face... This is one of the best moments in Slasher history, yes. Or at least, one of the most popular moments.The movie tries too hard to create more character and plot development than usual but it never gets very interesting. In fact, if it weren't for the ending, this could easily pass as a regular Slasher with nothing else to add. Sure, there are some good death scenes with good gore but nothing impressive.The acting is really good specially by Felisa Rose. The rest of the cast is just okay. The direction is dark and creepy but looks like an aged Slasher in these days.Overall, this is a classic for it's gruesome ending. The rest of the movie is just good.

32,Anonymous_Maxine,Boring as hell until the end...,6,20 February 2008,"As soon as Sleepaway Camp ends it is instantly obvious that it will always be remembered for it's shocking ending and probably nothing else. The performances are horrendous, as seems to have been the style in 80s horror films, the story is as thin and tasteless as tissue paper, and the killings are nothing memorable, with the exception of the first one, where a man gets boiling water dumped all over him (in an overwhelmingly unrealistic situation, but the lengthy shot of him screaming is pretty effectively unpleasant). I watched the movie by myself at night in my apartment on my university campus in central China, where I work as a teacher. At the moment we are nearing the end of our winter vacation, so on the entire campus there are only a handful of other people. Pretty effective environment to be affected by a horror movie. I'm a horror veteran, so I didn't expect to be unnerved at all by a cheesy old slasher movie, and I was right, until that ending scene. The shot of Angela with her mouth so wide open and her eyes bulging and peering to the side was one of the creepier shots that I've seen in a movie, especially an old 80s horror movie. There was a point in the movie where I was getting increasingly bored with Angela's endless silence, because I saw it going in one of two directions. It could turn out that she was totally innocent and was just a bonehead plot device to distract the audience's attention away from the real killer, or she could really be the killer, in which case the movie commits that age- old sin of the prime suspect acting extremely guilty because they ARE extremely guilty. I hate that. Oh and I have to say one more thing. The clothes that the characters wore were AWESOME. Especially the characters that were supposed to be tough guys, wearing tight cut-off jean shorts and tiny t-shirts that are cut off just below the nipples. HILARIOUS! I can only imagine those guys' kids laughing hysterically at the way their fathers used to dress!",Sleepaway Camp

34,jtindahouse,A lot more layers than your average slasher flick,9,18 June 2016,"After watching 'Sleepaway Camp' I was left to wonder whether horror has in fact gone backwards in the last 30 years. It's very rare that a modern horror film manages to have any effect on me whatsoever, however this film achieved it. A simple but effective tone, and a twist ending for the ages, all equal a very creepy experience. Horror has changed an incredible amount over the years. They used to apply the principles of, ""Keep it simple, stupid."" Before anything has happened in the movie and we are simply being treated to the opening credits over top of shots of the camp, the haunting music is being thrust at us already to set the mood. The acting is about what you expect, the delivery is often clunky, yet the intensity in key characters does the trick. I went into the film knowing there was to be a twist (the main reason I watched it). I spent the entire film trying to guess what it would be, and came up short. The visuals and sound in that final scene have gone down in history as one of the most shocking scenes in film history, and rightly so. The whole thing is just so unexpected and thrust on us in such a way that you can't help but become very uncomfortable. A good twist should have you looking back on things and questioning what you thought you know. This one does that and has quite a few discussion raising points. I'm very glad I took the time to track this film down and give it a watch, because it turned out to be a very rewarding experience.",Sleepaway Camp
35,hellraiser7,The Big Sleep,8,27 March 2018,"Warning do not read unless seen film.There always seems to be an attraction to horror taking place in camp grounds, it's hard to say way it could be because despite such a peaceful and beautiful locale away from civilization it's also unsettling because that very separation makes us vunurable for anything. But also most horror originated from the camp fire tales we've all heard at night while making a few of our own.Yeah, it another camp slasher film but it's one of the good ones, and personally this really is one of the ones that I like because it's slightly unique.
This was done like most of the camp slasher films on a minimum budget but I felt they did well with it, everything is on par. There are some good blood effects, it's not exactly a gore fest but this film isn't ment to be one, it's more invested in suspense. But the kills were good or decent all the same, the one kill that sticks out for me is the curling iron which I always found unsettling despite non gory it was suggestive as it corilates with our fear of getting burned by the tool. Music is also really good from the theme which is a brief tune but really gives an unsettling tone that were all about to enter a killzone in the guise of a camp. However the end theme is just excellent, it's one of my favorate movie tracks of all time, it's the kind of song I could just dance to but perfectly fits the film's end.But of course what I really like about the film is that it's a bit of a psychological suspense thriller. There aren't many characters that stick out in theis movie except for Angela and Ricky. Ricky I really like he's got a fun sense of humor as he sometimes has some wisecracks or makes certain jokes that are actually memorable, but what I like about him is how much he defends his cossin Angela. Some would say he's being overprotective but I don't feel he is at all, he's just doing what any good sibling/friend would do which normal and I emphasize with it, I don't let my best friends and girlfriends take crap they don't deserve.Felssa Rose is just excellent as Angela, she was another one of the actresses I had a crush on when I was a kid. Angela I found really sympathetic from the beginning and even at the end, she's a tragic character that is burdened with the tramatic loss of her family, and as time went on never really gotten over it . Which is understandable and goes with an old saying on how time doesn't always heal all wounds. Angela we see is just struggling to have a normal and good life but her efforts are fruitless, let alone hardly anyone in the camp is helpful and all stupidly make things worse for her (what the hell is everyone's problem anyway). There is this little subplot where Ricky's friend (played by Christopher Colet in which this is first film, man good start) and her are trying to get something going and it actually looks like things may look up for Angela. Ricky's friend isn't a bad guy except for one big problem, he want to go a little too fast with Angela. It's understandable with his case because people that age their hormones are just getting started and are on maximum overdrive which can override anyone's better judgement, but as it's said abstanace is always the way to go. Personally with any girl I'm always willing to wait, sure there are certain things I want to do with her as long as she's ready or both of us then it's ok; you should never force anyone to do anything that's not the way to go. This adds I feel more to the sympathy of Angela as she feels uncomfortable with him going too fast which is easy to emphatsize with even I don't like moving too fast. But there is another part of the suspense as you get an uneasy feeling about the fate of Ricky's friend, I honestly felt if he doesn't learn to apply the breaks soon he's in big trouble.The suspense in this film is very not just in wondering who's going to get it next and how; but also your constantly wondering and worried about Angela's mental state. The camp itself I found added to be an unsettling atmosphere, from the populace consisting of one blowhole after another, a few of the staff like that cook or head manager that should've been in jail instead of camp, or how poorly funded the camp is in certain areas which makes me wonder how the hell it's still running even I wouldn't go here. It's kinda the perfect killing ground but just has a atmosphere that tells you things aren't right.And of course as I said the psychological aspect I feel really adds on to the suspense. One of the scenes that stick out is a flashback sequence with Angela where we see her dad having some sort of same sex relationship but also another where her late brother is pointing at her, I'll admit I always found that sequence unsettling from the fact that in those sequences there is complete darkness that surrounds them which do me gives it an almost nightmare sensibility. It really raised some questions with me like where the heck is Angela's mom, is what's happening with the Dad an affair, do both Angela's brother and her have a not so good relationship? All of this just goes to show that everything going on with Angela's family isn't entirely kosher.And of course it comes down to an ending which I'll admit really turned my blood to ice, it's to me one of the best damn twists and endings to any movie, I honestly didn't see it coming which makes it all the better. I won't say what it is, but I'll just say it's something your remember for a very long time.Overall if you're a horror fan or even a fan of the slasher sub genere than this camp is worth a visit. The next camp you sleep at could be your big sleep.Rating: 3 stars",Sleepaway Camp

Unlike most of those that ca,e out during this era, the film makers actually spent some time in making a decent script that had a few good scares and one hell of an ending.

But Sleepaway Camp has definitely more flaws than bright moments: lousy acting (both teens and adults), brittle script, inadvertently funny realization of lethal events (intensified by ridiculous clothing and hairstyle of that time) is clearly prevailing; true, the very end is witty, but as I could guess the guilty one from the first felony, the value of the end was diminished to me. At present, the movie in question is apparently timeworn, no actor had a stepping-stone or is now widely known (the only one I recognized at all was Mike Kellin as Mel Costic).Consequently, watch the movie if you must :) Or if you are a real fan of the 1980ies slasher movies.

39,robfollower,Eighties' slasher opus,7,26 October 2019,"This unique entry into the slasher canon of the early '80s was the result of director Robert Hiltzik's graduate school work; he wrote the script as his senior thesis. While most of the gender-bending story's sexual confusion is ultimately half-baked, the plot twists are like sharp smacks in the face when compared to the tedium of a hundred other Friday the 13th rip-offs. Combined with imaginative murders, some realistic touches from the preteen cast (who curse up a blue streak and treat their peers with a true-to-life cruelty), and plenty of guffaw-worthy dialogue, Sleepaway Camp offers an enjoyably creepy ride into revenge-slaying territory. The famous shock ending might be evident early on to some viewers, but it still packs a wallop, if only of the ""I can't believe what I'm seeing!"" variety. Director Hiltzik does an admirably professional job in this, his only film to date. (Though a number of sequels followed Sleepaway Camp, he was involved with none of them.) Apparently, this was the only story he felt compelled to tell, and it sure is a weird one. While still a basic slasher film at its core, Sleepaway Camp is distinctive enough to warrant required viewing for genre enthusiasts.",Sleepaway Camp
40,Foreverisacastironmess123,"""Hey hey Bob-a-ray-Bob!"" Scary classic fun.",8,8 April 2016,"I really grew to love this movie fast, I enjoyed it a bit more each time I saw it. In a switch that is very rare for a slasher, rather than the kill scenes, what I personally like most about is the characters and how they swear, are frequently mean to each other and just how they interact, I think it comes off as very natural with this movie mostly. It was cool to see a flick like this where a lot of the teens were actually teenagers and not 20 somethings pretending to be. And while they're not super-developed or anything, the characters are characters and aren't totally faceless victims, it at least attempts to give them a little personality and humanity, and that's something that really stood out a lot to me with Sleepaway Camp. I think they brilliantly portrayed the atmosphere of the camp. It's not amazingly original as a whole, but it's definitely one slasher that offers a little more, its creepy underlining elements of insanity and child gender blurring push the envelope and make it stand out somewhat, there's deeper psychological stuff going on beneath the typical stalk and kill surface. I like the slashers that try out different concepts and approaches to the setup, which this certainly does. To me it's deserving of being regarded as more than just a fantastic twist ending. Yeah sure it caps off the whole thing in a brilliant way that you can never unsee, but it deserves a little more credit than only being known for that crazy final scene. Without the rest of the compelling mystery of the story to build up to it that ending, for how shocking it is, just wouldn't be nearly as effective. You may know Angela is the killer but you'll never know she's a guy! You'll never see it coming, and you'll barely see it when it appears, but it's there alright! And for better or worse it sticks with you. But it's not necessarily the uh, the penis that sticks with you, it's the whole notion of it and the bizarre and chilling image of the frozen face with the mouth agape, making those horrible animal sounds. Brr, oh man! I thought Felicia Rose gave a wonderful performance, mostly all with her big dark eyes, she puts a lot of feeling into them, there's something magnetic and eerie about all her stares, you never know what she's thinking... I don't get why poor Paul deserved to die. Apart from one very understandable and forgivable slight, he was nothing but a friend to her. I like the scenes of them together, their chemistry and friendship seemed sweet and genuine. It's funny, as opposed to everyone else she ruthlessly slaughters Paul's murder feels especially cold and unforgivable and finally makes her a monster to the audience after appearing so innocent and harmless all through the movie. I guess sometimes you just don't know what's really looking you right in the face until it's too late. She's probably made a few people turn the movie right off in her day, but I just love that aunt. If overacting was a crime they'd lock her up and throw away the key! Now she is creepy. She's the real monster of the movie, what kind of a demented bitch would inflict such a terrible thing on an innocent child who's just lost his family? I get a big kick out of the actress who plays Judy, an ideal campground mean girl for the ages! I find all of her over the top facial expressions and mannerisms just hysterical, she's kinda terrible, but she puts so much bitchy character into her face that it works and she's such a riot to watch! I love it but something that I found annoying was how the old man kept making excuses to keep the camp running even as people were turning up dead, when in reality they'd all have been sent home after one.. Movie logic! Also it's just gotta be said, some of the guys' wardrobe is seriously ridiculous, it looks like it's taken from a gay porn shoot and really lends the movie a bit of a homoerotic streak that's pretty dang hard to ignore at points! Overall though, they got a lot out of what they had to work with, and you can tell that they weren't working with a big budget. Absolute gem of a slasher that's worth checking out if you like the earlier more weird ones. ""Come children, let's be on our way!""",Sleepaway Camp

42,drownnnsoda,Prolific and unforgettable for all the right reasons,9,27 December 2006,"The VHS cover of ""Sleepaway Camp"" at the local video store haunted me as a kid— so much so that I dreaded going to a week-long camp excursion with my sixth grade class— I hadn't even seen the film— and I didn't need to. There's just something about camp that is unsettling for kids. You're away from home, and away from your parents for what is often the first time in your life; there are older kids in charge of you; there are bullies, there are pranks, there are lots of outdoor activities, and musty old bunks— but at Camp Arawak, that's not all you have to worry about, because there is a mad person slashing kids and adults left and right.Robert Hiltzik's cult shocker is indelibly one of the finest and most thematically weighty oddballs of all slasherdom. It's a dark film that begins in a dark way— a man and one of his children are killed in a gruesome boating accident. The daughter, Angela, survives, and, eight years later, is sent to camp with her cousin Ricky by her batty Aunt Martha. But it's clear something's not right with the blank-faced, impassive teenager, and when murders start occurring, things spiral out of control, derailing toward a gobsmacking conclusion.What could be incorrectly perceived as a ripoff of ""Friday the 13th"" is actually an extremely creative slasher film we have here that dodges the budding conventions of the genre; it's campy in many respects, but a ""Friday the 13th"" ripoff it is not. Despite its low budget, there are convincing special effects and creative camera-work that make the film feel far more sophisticated than you might expect, and a jarring and eerie score underlines this. There is plenty of hammy acting from the young kids, but Felissa Rose's doe-eyed performance as the catatonic Angela earned her a cult stardom that is well-deserved, and Jonathan Tiersten backs her as her foul-mouthed, overprotective cousin. All that said, the film's real strength hinges on its script, which is daring and unconventional for a number of reasons; it manages to deal with an array of taboo topics, such as gay parents, gender confusion, child abuse, sexuality, and bullying— all implicitly, mind you— and does so under the protocol of a horror film. Furthermore, it delivers what is inarguably one of the most legendary conclusions of any slasher film, with a twist that would have impressed Hitchcock. And, while it may not reach the cosmopolitan ranks established by the Master of Suspense, as a low budget '80s slasher production, it does a damn fine job trying. 9/10.",Sleepaway Camp
43,hu675,Surprisingly likable slasher movie.,8,26 July 2010,"After a boating accident that killed her father and her sister, Angela (Felissa Rose) and her cousin Ricky (Jonathan Tierston) are going to Camp Arawak for the summer. Angela wasn't been in that camp for years, since her family died there. Slowly, there has been accidents and murders happening in the camp. Who is the twisted person, who is behind all these murders? Directed by Robert Hiltzik (Return to Sleepaway Camp, Sleepaway Camp Reunion) made an enjoyable, professional well made slasher B movie with an winning cast. Rose is certainly the stand-out in the movie. Tierston and Christopher Collet gives likable performances. Karen Fields (Her only film role) steals the show as a mean-spirited teen.The DVD from Legacy Entertainment is Uncut but it suffers an lousy Pan & Scan (1.33:1) transfer and the Dolby Digital 2.0 Mono Sound is decent. Anchor Bay DVD is certainly has better picture quality and sound but an few scenes were trimmed down for some reason. ""Sleepaway Camp"" is certainly one of the better slasher movies of the 1980's and it is certainly memorable for it's shocking unexpected conclusion. (****/*****).",Sleepaway Camp
44,Samuel-Shovel,What a Fun Midnight Movie!,7,19 December 2017,"I'd previously heard of this movie and it's disturbing twist of an ending so I knew what I was getting myself into when I decided to toss this one on. With the ending already ruined for me, I was expecting it to not be that enjoyable (since I'd heard that the rest of the movie was kind of a snore); but this movie actually exceeded my expectations!This movie has some really fun horror elements and climatic death sequences. The scene with the hornets nest in the bathroom I will always remember. And even though I was prepared for the big finale, it was still a shocking, grotesque, disturbing image that greeted me.There are some parts of this that were fairly boring. I definitely could have done with out that entire baseball game, but all in all it's hard to complain about a movie that's under 90 minutes. The acting isn't spectacular but I think it tells a twisted psychological story that people might ""sleep on"" just because it's a cheaply made 80's horror movie. It's actually decently done.",Sleepaway Camp
45,aidanratesmovies,One of those 80's Films that have NOT aged well,4,13 March 2021,"Sleepaway Camp is purely a deep example today of the outdated societal problems we all recognize today. Unfortunately, it's also a total mess, poorly acted, and isn't truly very scary. The plot of this film is rather bland and predictable for the most part. There is a nice twist at the end, but I feel its kinda transphobic, which wasn't very comfortable for me to watch to say the least. Throughout the film we also get all of the 80's societal fears thrown in there, including rape, abuse, and homophobia. Ts a film that hasn't aged very well, and although some moments of uncomfortable situations can be satisfying in the end- many of the moments can be very hard to watch- and prove to be nothing but a cruel reminder of how unaccepting we were in society back then. Maybe this review got a bit personal for me, but it dealt with many themes and ideas that affect me personally, and it's hard I guess to not get personal. It's a poorly made film as much as it is a poorly conceived one, not truly knowing what message it wants to spread, and only focusing on the ugliness of every situation. It can be entertaining from time to time, but it's wooden acting and poor script make for quite a memorable but enjoyable experience that I guess is original- but not very satisfying.
My Rating: 4.25/10",Sleepaway Camp
46,framptonhollis,one of the most baffling horror movies I think I've ever seen,8,31 July 2018,"'Sleepaway Camp' is a film that is weird from the very start. The opening scene is pretty bad to be honest, the acting is so ridiculously week and there's this generally schlocky feeling throughout it. Then, in the very next scene, we get this bizarre encounter with a beyond-eccentric mother character performed by a lady who acts as if she's in a John Waters movie. Then, as the film goes on, we've got blatantly pedophiliac chefs, both comically and uncomfortably lengthy shots holding on the aftermath of the slasher killings, noticeable homoeroticism, seeming social commentary, a perverted old camp councilor who's shamelessly greedy, and just a general build up of events that is super discomforting. It's super funny, too, in a way, sometimes intentionally, sometimes possibly unintentionally, but I honestly don't even know. The movie is described as ""original"" by many solely because of its twist, which is extremely unique and affecting (especially how it is shown and presented and hinted at throughout the film; plus, the final image is genuinely unsettling and will likely haunt my mind for years to come), but throughout there's just so much weird things going on that I think it really is one of the most unique slasher films ever made. The constant commentary on sexuality, the surreal humour, and the abundance of bizarre pauses/stretches of just horrible screaming coming from the victims help make the whole film an original work of horror cinema and just generally disturbing to me. In its final moments, it isn't perfectly done, and the gore effects are kind of cheap and simple, but it depicts some things that are just so brutal and difficult to digest, and, in the end, it is super tragic and depressing. It's hard for me to exactly say what I can really think of this film, it seriously makes me want to look into it and whatever its intentions may be. There are really campy moments throughout and a lot of what seems to be very intentional black comedy and there are a few scenes that just go all out and nearly approach some kind of surreal or dreamlike quality that's tough to pin down, and there are these odd sequences of what feels like shameless filler, and then it just punches you in the face with a heartbreaking and horrifying final scene and then that's it. One thing is for certain, this was an extremely entertaining film to watch throughout, and it did have a serious impact on me despite its numerous flaws.",Sleepaway Camp
47,PredragReviews,"""Meet me at the waterfront after the social.""",8,12 July 2016,"At first glance, ""Sleepaway Camp"" appears to be just another entry from the glut of early 80's low budget slasher flicks. And in most respects, ""Sleepaway Camp' fits the bill: borderline acting, poor production values, mostly stock one-dimensional teen characters, a summer camp setting, and a mysterious killer who never seems to make a mistake when dispatching unsuspecting victims in elaborate and gruesome methods. Those points aside however, ""Sleepaway Camp"" is probably the most originally perverse slasher film ever. The whole unsettling framework of ""Sleepaway Camp"" is supported by themes of homosexuality, pedophilia, sexual identity issues, and the slaughtering of very young teenage, and in some cases, preteen victims. Of course, one cannot evaluate ""Sleepaway Camp"" without mentioning the shocking twist ending, which has garnered the film a rabid cult following. In fact, along with a very nice performance from newcomer Felissa Rose and some truly quirky characters (Aunt Martha anyone ?!?), the ending of ""Sleepaway Camp"" is enough in itself to recommend at least one viewing for genre fans. The majority of ""Sleepaway Camp"" is painfully by the numbers, but the ending is quite surprising and more than a little disturbing. Most of the cast don't make any particular impression on me. But Felissa Rose is priceless. Her mere presence elevates the film. There are times when she can seem so menacing, and mysterious. Other times, she comes across as so forlorn and vulnerable.(her body language conveys an epic lack of enthusiasm for summer camp). Then, out of the blue, she manifests this quirky, adorable charm(""Burt Reynolds!""). Those moments really stand out in such a dark, perverse movie. This charm, and underlying warmth, are one other factor that remind me of ""Carrie"". You get a little brief insight into what this kid might have been if so many people had not been so cruel and abusive towards her. It does come out of left field and takes you by surprise. It's quite nasty and a little disturbing. You'll think about it after the movie is over, filling in the loop holes with the answer given at the end. I recommend this film mainly for the ending. Overall rating: 8 out of 10.",Sleepaway Camp
48,slayrrr666,Great ending to an okay ending,8,9 February 2006,"""Sleepaway Camp"" is one of the best early 80s camp-slasher films.**SPOILERS**Arriving at a summer camp, Angela Baker (Felissa Rose) and her cousin Ricky (Jonathan Tiersten) immediately rub the head counselor Meg (Katharine Kamhi) by how different and quiet she is. Ronnie (Paul DeAngelo) and Susie (Susan Glaze) take time to break her out of her shell, but Ricky is protective of her and doesn't want her to be exposed to too much. As people start dying at camp, Mel, (Mike Kellin) the head of the camp, keeps insisting that it's just fluke accidents. As Angela finally comes out of her shell around Paul, (Christopher Collet) the murders around camp start increasing. As everyone starts to suspect the new-comers Angela and Ricky as the killer, the camp tries to stop the killer from striking again.The Good News: Well, first off, this has one of, if the not the, best ending to a horror film ever. It comes so far from left field and is so unexpected that no one would ever believe it. It's also really original to end it that way, as all the clues point elsewhere, then we get dropped with the bombshell of all bombshells with the ending that comes out of nowhere, and it does seem completely shocking on first viewing. By pulling the rug out of our feet with a complete turn-around is a wonderful in it's execution. I can't say enough about the great ending, go see it for yourself. Also nice was the way that all the deaths aren't exactly the typical deaths for this type of movie. Granted, there is an impalement with an knife and a decapitation, but the rest of the film features some great kills, including being stung to death by bees,, scalded with boiling water, and a pretty nasty one involving a curling iron and a special part of the female anatomy. That's all I'm going to say on that one. Pretty nifty kills, although some have been done before. It's also pretty good at setting up the storyline to make the characters so believable. Angela is a quiet, shy teenage girl, and Ricky her protective cousin. While not exactly new, the combination of both is a nice addition to the rest of the characters at camp. Pretty much stereotypical characters, but all mixed together with some new ones.The Bad News: For the time this came out, it should've been way more graphic. This one is very dry and features next to no blood. Only two deaths happen on-screen as well, which is a shame as several would've been nice to see what happened to them. However, more gore was needed to make the film a little more entertaining, but it still is fine right now. Just more. Also, since the sequels went for a more campy approach, this one goes more of a serious route. It's very discerning to see Angela played her as a shy, quiet type and as a wise-cracking woman in the sequels.The Final Verdict: With one of cinema's greatest endings that is really shocking and a big body count for the time, this is a very underrated film. Fans of the time frame will eat this one up, but fans of the sequels may find it odd that there is none of the goofy sense of humor apparent in this film.Rated R: Graphic Language, Violence, and full male Nudity",Sleepaway Camp

One of the worst movies I have endured, and the FF button got regular use.So a great ending, the problem being it's at the end of this production - right? Nope, and you can fcuk me sideways if you disagree. As an ending it outdoes the final flourish of Inga the chimpanzee in Argento's Phenomena: so absurd I burst out laughing.

The soundtrack was awesome; I'm still searching for the song 'Tonight You're Mine' but have not been able yet to find it, sadly it looks like it was never released, a lot of horror soundtrack of the 80's never was.Sleepaway Camp is totally worth watching, lame and campy (get it?) but still managing to keep you focused 'till the end.",Sleepaway Camp

And I think that ending alone makes it worth watching the movie. You do have to get passed by bad acting,typical eighties fashion and did I mention bad acting. ""Sleepaway Camp"" is defined as a slasher movie. While it does have several killings and it is implied that they are gruesome most of it happen off screen. It nearly doesn't contain as much gore as one would expect from a movie like this. And because of it's special twist it isn't your typical slasher movie.

There was an abundance of them that graced video.  I don't think half of them actually made it to the big screen.  You can add Sleepaway Camp to that list.  This is a typical scary film.  It has it's moments and it is scary in some parts.  It has some nice humour especially when they play camp jokes on each other.  But having said all that, this movie is as good as it is and it's not too bad ) because the mother in this film is creepier than Mrs. Bates and she actually makes you want to kill her.  But the two parts that I will never forget are images that are firmly planted in my brain, especially the part of it that stores nasty horror elements in it.
The first was the death by curling iron.  It is so horrific that it bothered me so much that I had to cover my eyes the second time I saw it.  It is qutie graphic, not because of what they show, but because you know how nasty it is.But the one thing that will stay with me and probably anyone else that has seen this film is the very end.  That last shot is so horrific, so way out of left field that you never see it coming.  It just hits you and then it ends.  It has a power of its own.

Then the annoying kid who overturned the boat to scare the girl who's also on the boat and he was drowned and found with a snake in his mouth just like he scared the girl. Angela seemed depressed because his brother and father died at the accident in the lake several years agos. Then the boy in the bath killed with a beehive in the stall and the way he looked after was very grotesque and triggered me because of those nasty holes all over his body. Then the annoying guide meg was killed in the shower. She was stabbed at her back and found by his date the camp owner and he beat Ricky because he thought it was him who was killing people. Then after his date left because he was scared of getting caught, Judy the very annoying teen got killed with a pillow on his face and her curling iron. The most brutal thing that happened in the movie is the killing of boys that are sleeping in their sleeping bags in the forest near the campsite. The guide found them chopped up in their sleeping bags. The police then arrived and they found Ricky who's still alive. Angela wanted Paul who's her crush to come to the waterfront. And when they found them by the lake, they were naked and Angela threw his severed head and she was naked and they all saw her penis as his aunt raised him as a girl because she didn't have one.

59,blott2319-1,Trashy B-movie that lives and dies on a big twist,3,12 October 2020,"I still remember the trauma I had the first time I watched Sleepaway Camp as a kid at a friend's house. For a kid who never watched any horror films, this was like torture. Watching it now, the horror is kind of gone from the entire thing. (It doesn't help that I've listened to the How Did This Get Made podcast about the film more than once, so the whole movie kind of makes me laugh.) There are a few gross makeup/prop effects, but the actual kills are so telegraphed and silly that it is hard to get even slightly scared by the film. In fact what is much more horrifying is the rampant abuse both mentally and sexually that we see from the adults throughout the movie. They seem entirely fine with talking casually about molesting children, they are relatively unconcerned when people first start dying, and then there's the big surprise at the end which is manufactured by a horribly insane woman that causes mental trauma on a scale that is immeasurable.I have to assume the minor cult status of Sleepaway Camp comes from 2 things. First of all, the film pushes the envelope. It is a movie with a great deal of sexuality (even with underage kids,) it has those young kids swearing like sailors, and it has a large number of violent murders. There isn't much that is left to the imagination in this horror film. But more importantly, I think people have a fondness for Sleepaway Camp because of the big twist ending. It did stick with me since childhood, so I guess that moment is effective, however watching the film when you know the ending is a bit problematic. It creates some massive plot holes that are impossible to get around, and it makes many more details confusing. Even if the twist worked, that doesn't change that Sleepaway Camp is poorly made. It seems everyone is over-acting and no one behaves like a real human being. Overall, it's just an ugly film to watch and doesn't function well for me in any capacity.",Sleepaway Camp
60,mattymatt4ever,Well above average; one of the best B-horror movies ever made!,7,13 January 2003,"I don't understand why the film gathered such a low rating.  This is definitely better than most of the B-slashers I've seen.  First of all, it's pretty well-done.  Most films like these are pure guilty pleasures, but this one has quality.  The death sequences are all quite creative and left to the imagination.  Sometimes it seems like people are robots and are quick to regard any slasher flick as gratuitously violent.  Have you seen the ""Friday the 13th"" movies?  Were any of those death scenes left to the imagination? And that's not to say all the ""Friday"" movies are bad; it's just this movie had a certain tastefulness to it that most movies of its kind lack.  As a matter of fact, the shower scene is the only scene that contains any blood. And I like the gradual way in which the corpses were revealed.  And like I said previously, the scenes are creative.  Though it's a slasher flick, very few victims actually get ""slashed.""  This isn't the run-of-the-mill slice-em-dice-'em flick.  There are exciting ways to kill the victims that don't have to include kitchen knives.The acting is adequate at best, but I've seen much worse.  After all, bad acting is a B-movie tradition.  But sometimes the acting could be so bad it makes you want to puke.  Not the case with this film.  The characters, though cliched, are well-developed and that's another reason why it stands out among many slasher flicks.  The romantic and jealousy subplots are sophomoric, but they're not taken way over-the-top.  (PROBABLY NOT A SPOILER, BUT YOU CAN'T BE TOO CAREFUL; POSSIBLE SPOILER AHEAD)As for the plot twist...definitely unexpected!  At first when I read the comments on Netflix about the plot twist, I thought the identity of the killer would be a surprise.  The killer's identity is pretty obvious throughout, though the death scenes are shot from the killer's point of view, never revealing who he or she is.  But the real twist is the final shot.  Boy, was that haunting...and disturbing.  But what can I say?  It was unexpected.  And made sense, since it was foreshadowed.  Even the song at the end was really creepy.  And the overall score was pretty creepy in itself.  ""Sleepaway Camp"" is not as ""campy"" (pun intended) as you'd expect. Hopefully, many will be very impressed by it.  It seems like it had received cult status (with a website and all), and I'm proud it did.

61,hnt_dnl,Actual attempt at a provocative slasher flick...Who knew?!,7,26 June 2011,"SLEEPAWAY CAMP (1983) is one of those rare 80s cult films that slipped right under my radar! I THINK that I must have heard about this film before, but, honestly, I'm just not sure! If I had heard the name before, I probably thought it was the typical 80s teen comedy cheesy sex romp that came out in droves in that decade.On the surface, the movie reminds one of Friday the 13th simply due to the camp, summertime setting, but after I saw it recently the film Psycho came immediately into my mind! This movie isn't the standard slasher-vengeance flick like most slasher movies of the 80s (and now!). It has strong psychological underpinnings. There are some genuinely disturbing scenes in this movie!The central character is Angela (played impressively by a then 13-year old Felissa Rose), an extremely shy and lonely teen who goes off to camp with her cousin Ricky (played with a lot of spunk by then teen Jonathan Tiersten). Angela was raised by her aunt, Ricky's mom, after Angela's father and brother were killed 8 years earlier in a tragic boat accident (a rather disturbing scene shown at the film's start), which has obviously traumatized Angela all these years.At camp, Angela gets bullied by several kids, especially the girls, including one of the camp counselors Meg (played with confident malice by Katharine Kahmi) and fellow camper Judy (an over-the-top, yet funny Karen Fields). Other than her protective cousin Ricky, the only bright spot for Angela is when she meets and connects with the boy camper Paul (played with stalwart appeal by 80s teen star Christopher Collett). Angela actually opens up to Paul amidst all the bullying and loneliness.Of course, the overt plot of the flick is that several killings occur. Early on, they just seem like freak accidents to the camp director Mel (veteran actor Mike Kellin in a rather thankless role). It's a bit of a stretch to believe that after a couple of kids dying, they would actually let camp continue! But, they actually do seem like accidents. Then the movie moves into full blown slasher territory in the last half hour with several of the main characters getting killed off one by one in very creative ways. I actually found the killings and maimings in this movie to be kind of disturbing simply because they weren't the typical stuff you see in the Jason/Freddie/Mike Myers oeuvre where theirs a bunch of slashing with sharp objects. Also, the killings aren't done to elicit cheap laughs or puns at all, as you typically get in many cheesy slasher films. They are MEANT to be disturbing! The ending is the big shocker and explains this film's lasting popularity.It's kind of obvious that the movie was made on the cheap, but at the same time, it's not the most amateurish looking low budget film I've ever seen. It actually attempts genuine character interaction. Some of the dialogue is actually pretty funny and comes naturally. Plus, there are some sly moments that hint at the themes of the film. And the main young actors playing Angela, Ricky, Meg, Judy, and Paul really do a good job given what they have to work with. Ironically, the only adult actor to leave an impression is Desiree Gould, who plays Ricky's mom and Angela's aunt; this character is EXTREMELY odd; she bookends the movie and the ending explains in part her behavior.Although there are obvious elements of several other famous horror movies at play here (Carrie, Psycho, Friday the 13th), the movie definitely has it's own identity that doesn't make it some cheap knockoff. I'm not usually big on criticizing datedness, but the movie is so 70s-looking that it does kind of detract from it, and the script is fairly standard fare, not to mention a few too many cliché characters; I found those jerkish male bullies to be kind of useless to the plot, in particular. The main draw is that this movie really is a psychological tale in the guise of a slasher movie and if you focus on the REAL story, I actually think the theme will stick with you long after the movie is over!",Sleepaway Camp
62,ODDBear,One long buildup to a fantastic final frame,5,12 August 2004,"The plot is simple; Teenagers are getting sliced in a summer camp.  Who's behind it?  If you know very little about the movie or it's sequels, then the ending will surprise you quite a bit.  It's disturbing to say the least. However, the 79 or so minutes that preceed it aren't very noteworthy.  It's basically like Friday the 13th, only less suspenseful and it actually has worse acting performances.  But if you're a fan of the genre (80's slasher flicks), then you might wanna check it out, especially for the sick and twisted final frame.",Sleepaway Camp
63,TOMASBBloodhound,Sleazeaway Camp,3,22 October 2006,"Someone out there must have loved it, or so many sequels never would have gotten the green light. Sleepaway Camp is a vile, disturbing, and cheap attempt at making a horror film. The story deals with an extremely quiet young girl getting tormented at summer camp, and those who torment her quickly getting offed. The film would like to think of itself as a mystery, but it's too lazy to even set up halfway decent red herrings. The acting, writing, casting, and everything else is considerably sub-par for the genre. There were dozens and dozens of better films of this kind made back then, and the fact that it spawned so many sequels is truly baffling.The main character is a young lady(?) named Angela. Early in the film we see her father and a sibling apparently die in a boating accident, then the next thing we know, she and a cousin are off to summer camp together a few years later. The woman playing her aunt gives one of the most truly ridiculous performances this critic has ever seen in a film. She only gets about five minutes of screen time but before its over, the film has already gotten off to a bad start because of her.The film is not scary at all. At the very least, a horror film must in some way be frightening. This one isn't even tense. It's just a parade of sleazy characters and situations from the moment the kids arrive at camp. First off we see a perverted cook looking over the kids getting off the buses and drooling over them. Most of the kids at this camp don't seem to have gone through puberty, and that only seems to incite this creep even further. Though he quickly gets what's coming to him, his character leaves a rotten stench that seems to only intensify as the film moves along. There are other disgusting aspects of the film. Most of the young men wear the kind of tight clothing that leaves nothing to the imagination about the size of their packages. Former Congressman Mark Foley would have enjoyed visiting this set, it's safe to say. Another scene has a rude young woman raped with a hot curling iron. There is male frontal nudity in the final scene, as well.Had the film been at least a little scary, then it would have been easier to ignore some of the sleaziness. The film just isn't scary, however. There isn't even much gore. There is a ""big twist"" at the end, but it's only there for shock value. Nothing we learn in the final scene adds any new dimension to the plot. It just comes as one more in a long line of sleazy occurrences.Most of the cast never went on to anything else, and their poor performances here generally show you why.For curiosity seekers only. This film is worth 3 of 10 stars to the Hound.",Sleepaway Camp
64,aesgaard41,Friday the 13th meets Psycho !,7,21 December 2000,"SPOILERS AHEAD:There is a lot of flak over the integrity of this movie. It comes across as a rip-off of the first ""Friday The 13th"" but then the closure with the realization of the killer's true identity almost nearly redeems the whole movie with a plot twist that rivals the end of ""Psycho."" The majority of the deaths don't have the flair or the gore of traditional slasher films: a boy is drowned, a pedophile cook in scalded from head to toe but survives and there's an unclear shot of three kids who have been chopped up. One boy is stung to death by bees but he is so panic-stricken that he doesn't think clearly enough to crawl out under a toliet stall door barred against him. There's a vague shot of a girl getting ""intimately"" impaled on a curling iron and a rather puerile shower murder more or less violent than the one in ""Psycho."" None of these scenes are very scary or suspenseful, but the closing shot of the killer's identity will give you nightmares. the flashbacks disclosing the killer's wierd past interupt the flow of the already tedious script. Nevertheless, this movie has become somewhat of a cult film inspiring two unnecessary sequels. My only advice is don't rent these movies, buy them !",Sleepaway Camp

Fast-forward, sometime later, possibly a few years, the girl who survived the accident is living with her eccentric aunt who sends her to camp with her cousin who is very protective of her due to her reclusive nature. The camp start of typically - outdoor activities and fun - but soon bizarre and increasingly frightening occurrences reign the camp in the form of a mysterious killer. Accusations fly, the body count mounts, but nothing can prepare the survivors for the answer of who is behind the horror.As mentioned in the headline, this is a cult movie - meaning not for all tastes. That goes virtually double for this film with its low production values and general cheesiness. Also the story is at first very generic - killer stalks, people are afraid, blah blah blah... it has been done before a multitude of times. The killing scenes should interest only slasher fans......however...... the third act makes this film stand out of the slasher crowd in its own special place. The finale to this little film is so out there, so twisted, so bizarre, that not only do you not see it coming, you weren't even expecting anything like it. The final shot (the kicker to the kicker) is also truly terrifying. The film's strange power resonates with you after you watch it as you begin to make sense of the ending through clues dropped in parts of the film.A must for horror fans, though others will want to steer clear. 7/10Rated R: violence/gore and... some really twisted stuff!",Sleepaway Camp

67,DarthVoorhees,A highly memorable and very frightening slasher film,8,11 April 2012,"A bozo with a knife is only as frightening as the surroundings and mythos surrounding them. 'Sleepaway Camp' is a memorable and effective entry in the 80's slasher pool because it takes this to heart and creates a highly memorable character with motives, mythos, and a terrible secret that drives them to be violent.What really drives me into 'Sleepaway Camp' and my recommendation of it is how well it captures the feeling of adolescence and bullying. Childhood and the early teen years can be a horrible period to live through and that is what 'Sleepaway Camp' is. What we have here is a nightmare about the pressures of growing up and vengefulness against bullies creating a horrible atmosphere, one strong enough to kill. For once these sex and prank crazed teens actually sort of feel real because what hunts them is a very real threat too. You kind of forget being removed from the real experience for a few years that teens only do have two things on their mind, sex and their inflated egos. And what better place to put these sick teens than summer camp? It really is a no holds barred hellish playground for teens to enact all their wildness. Camp is the perfect metaphor for growing up out of childhood. The summer brings everything to life and the boys and girls practice their budding sexual feelings with one another while still in the confines of being in a great childish place with games, swimming, and all the freedom to do it except of course the eyes of a camp counselor who themselves are young enough to let kids be kids. And yet for some there is awkwardness. They cannot get out of childhood, be they not ready mentally or physically and they stick out for bullies like a sore thumb. 'Sleepaway' captures all these elements pitch perfectly with it's young cast and locales.And that is why 'Sleepaway Camp' works, the theme of sex and blossoming maturity. I am sure if you are reading this you know the horrible secret of Angela Baker and despite it's shock value and novelty, it is a perfect device to build this type of horror film around. The chemical urges of puberty are really the building blocks for conflict and disaster. Angela Baker is warped because she has been so violated in her psychological and biological identity of herself that she cannot handle the adolescent experience offered by summer camp. Felissa Rose is very good at portraying a shy adolescent girl and this is exactly why the film is effective and why that ending is so memorable. We see Angela Bakers growing up and we know what drives this killer and it makes the villain tragic.",Sleepaway Camp
68,ersinkdotcom,An essential piece of slasher and horror genre history,8,2 May 2014,"1983's ""Sleepaway Camp"" has everything one could want in a genre piece and more. Not only does the movie have one of the best surprise endings ever conceived, it also does a better job than most at establishing characters you can truly identify with emotionally.After a tragic boating accident, Angela is taken in by her kooky Aunt Martha and Cousin Ricky. Angela and Ricky are sent to summer camp to enjoy themselves and make new friends. Not long after arriving, a series of accidents begin occurring. Are they all mishaps or has someone returned to the camp looking for some type of retribution?Writer / Director Robert Hiltzik has fashioned one of the finest examples of the slasher genre with ""Sleepaway Camp."" All the right ingredients are here. There's suspense, mystery, gore, and characters you actually feel sorry for. Don't get me wrong. You also want to see several of them die as well.I can't think of a more perfect film to sit next to your copies of ""Friday the 13th"" and ""The Burning"" on your shelves.

69,acidburn-10,One of the better Friday The 13th clones,7,1 May 2007,"Sleepaway Camp is one of those movies that you just have to love, although far from original as it is a Friday The 13th clone but one of the better ones unlike crappy disappointing flicks like (Don't Go Into The Woods and The Final Terror), Well, slasher flicks are allowed to be unoriginal and I for one love this slasher flick.The story revolves around Angela and her cousin Ricky who have just gone to camp for the summer. Well, a killer shows up and starts offing the kids at the camp in various ways. Now, it's fairly obvious who the killer is and the ways the killer uses to off his victims are anything but gory.Felissa Rose truly gives a stand out performance as Angela and the rest of the cast truly gives solid performances such as Ricky Angela's cousin gives both a funny and believable performance played by Johnathan Tierston, Karen Fields plays the bitch Judy down to a tee and one of the movie's highlights is her scene where she gets her just desserts, Christopher Collet plays Paul the kind hearted boyfriend of Angela really well, Mel the head of the camp is fine watch out for his death scene played by Mike Kellin, Katherine Kamhi played the slutty Meg brilliantly and Desiree Gould as Aunt Martha had fun with her 2 minute role.Sleepaway Camp is a very good slasher flick and even though it might be predictable and unoriginal, this is still highly entertaining. Don't you dare miss this one.All in all very entertaining Friday The 13th clone but with the major twist ending this movie is memorable",Sleepaway Camp

71,Beejerman,"JEER the movie, CHEER! the ending - (6 stars out of 10)",6,4 January 2019,"The stage curtains open ...For years, I have avoided watching this film because from the trailers and promos, it was obviously just a glorified B-movie - one that undoubtedly sucked. But then one night, a friend of mine and I decided to go ahead and rent it and just have fun with this oldie (he'd never seen it yet either). We popped the popcorn and threw it in the machine and cringed and laughed and trash talked the movie all the way to the end - because yeah, it really does suck.The story revolves around two cousins, Angela and Ricky, who go to a summer camp together. Angela is an introvert and recluse who has a difficult time opening up and being accepted by others due an earlier childhood tragedy that she survived through. Because of this, she is constantly picked on and basically tortured by other kids there at the camp leading up to the film's (now famous) twist, shock ending. Little did my friend and I know what was in store for us.So, here we are, laughing and carrying on and we watch as the film unveils its stunning ending. Our eyes popped out, our jaws dropped - neither one of us believing what the other was seeing. Are you kidding me? Wow! What a great ending - in fact, one of the best I've ever seen. The image remains in my mind to this day. I'll never forget it and I would recommend this film JUST so you can be one of the lucky ones to see what has now gained cult status.",Sleepaway Camp
72,doctorsmoothlove,Almost bad but too clever to be ordinary.,6,3 October 2009,"There is one word to describe Sleepaway Camp and that is astonishing. In one scene the movie goes from derivative to slasher classic. A huge plot twist revealed at the last moment solves a mystery we may not have even been trying to figure out. The whole film follows the conventional slasher formula and convinces us of the killer's identity. None of the pre-final shot is frightening or even suspenseful. The director relies on a provocative ending that reveals the actual killer to save the film. I'm surprised to admit it, but it works. It really, really works.Many character archetypes are visible and rightly killed. All of them are linked to a shy girl named Angela and her cousin Ricky. The perverted camp counselor, bully, jock, slut, and slut's best friend are all killed by a mysterious entity and the leading authoritative figure (a camp director in this film) assumes Ricky is responsible for the murders. He savagely beats Ricky, who we presume is dead, until the last shot. As panic has spread throughout camp, two counselors discover Angela on the beach with the severed head of a boy and are aghast to observe her penis.This is but one of many horror films that occurs at a summer camp. This one isn't particularly isolated nor do many of the murders occur at night. Several years ago, Angela and her brother Peter were swimming with their father when a boat struck them. Peter and the dad were assumed dead. We are shown a bloody life vest at the beginning and then the flashback ends. Just who was killed? The dad clearly was. Peter actually survived and was raised as Angela by his wingbat aunt. During the whole movie, Angela is never seen socializing with the other girls and doesn't swim. She does develop a crush on a boy who later betrays her. Despite her presumed unhappiness in not being viewed as male, Angela adjusts to life as a girl. Only people who tease her are victims, including young children.Sleepaway Camp isn't stylistically different from many of its contemporaries. None of its cast is skilled in effectively convincing us this isn't a slasher movie nor is the terribly sophomoric dialog they spew. I also like how none of the murders are preceded by long chase sequences. It adds authenticity to the excitement of seeing baddies ripped apart. You would be challenged to find slasher films that don't come off as cheesy with elaborate chases required before our masked hero strikes.The movie also varies significantly from the standard genre requirements. Most of the campers survive the film and the Final Girl is actually the killer. The said killer also has a realistic back-story instead of some generic traumatic experience. People with gender identity disorder like Angela become confused and angry when they can't be themselves. One of my friends in high school was in the process of becoming female and was decisively unhappy as a man. He also hides under the mask of mistaken gender instead of a physical mask.What a clever way director Hiltzik took the slasher requirements and crafted an intelligent and terrifying film. A plot twist within a plot twist is able to hide 85 minutes of drivel. Even today the film still satisfies and warrants repeated viewings. The general entertainment provided by the slasher venue is enough to hold us until the last shot. Seriously, take a look the final part clip on youtube. It's one of the best moments in any American horror film.",Sleepaway Camp
73,Nightman85,the odd-ball of 80's slashers,8,24 July 2005,"Sleepaway Camp is a bit of an off-beat edition to the wave of early '80's slasher films. The story is this: a disturbed little girl and her cousin go off to summer camp, where someone begins killing the various characters who offend them. It sounds like business as usual right? To a point it is, but this movie is different from the average slash-fest. The storyline falls into teenage drama from time to time. Much of the leading cast is quite young! In fact, at times it seems like it could be a cross between after school special and slasher flick.But the real strangeness of this film is its leading character. The movie is built around this young girl and the question of her part in the killings. It all builds to a climax and a revelation that has made this slasher a memorable one! The direction, natural locations, and subtle music score help to give this movie some good atmosphere, especially during the final night of the story. The youthful stars are quite good, even though as a whole the casts performances are uneven.Like the Friday the 13th films, the original Sleepaway Camp is the best of its series. Thus far this film has been followed by two raunchy-comedy sequels that are strictly for laughs (and groans).Sleepaway Camp is one you won't forget!*** out of ****",Sleepaway Camp

First, the vibe is great and acting from the main characters is correct. Second, even not as brutal as Friday the 13th, murders are quite acceptable.

It's a movie that's not afraid to deal with some heavy subjects while at the same time sticking to the slasher genre.
For its time and budget, the effects are pretty good too. It's an extremely campy movie but it's one that stands out from the others in the sense that it's one you'll never forget for the twist ending.

I remember some unique death scenes, though unfortunately the one I remembered most wasn't in the first one here.

This ranks up there with Friday the 13th and is very similar in ways: camp, teens, HORNY teens, stupid teens, blind counselors, killer. The acting was horrid. But, all the actors are no-name meaning anyone can be killed at any time, which made it much better. This movie was very messed up in some parts but I still enjoyed it. Some of the kills were very unique and well played out. The ending sure confused me but was ultimately very good, sick and completely unexpected. I can't pick out any real actors (besides James Earl Jones' dad) in this movie but its probably for the better since big name actors distract from a horror movie's plot and water the film down.

The film is the epitome of a slasher film in so many ways, for example the time period's campy atmosphere, cheesy teenage dialogue, point of view from an unknown killer, and a twist ending when the killer is finally revealed. What makes Sleepaway Camp special is that it's also different than many slashers with a large mix and certain complexity of characters, entertaining filler scenes and its fearless filmmaking. The ending comes to shock to anyone who doesn't know about the twist prior to watching the film.

80,bob_meg,Sometimes a first time director can't do it all,5,2 February 2011,"Robert Hiltzik's cult 1983 slasher could very well be the most uneven entry in the genre that had its heyday from 1978 to about 1984.It's virtually undebatable that the film's gender-bending ending is shocking, well-executed in both production and acting, and even iconic in its grand-guignol style imagery (remember, this was before ""Crying Game""). But can you hang an entire movie on it, or a legion of drooling fans who seem to know every inch of the celluloid in obsessive detail? And indeed, there's a lot to know about ""Sleepaway Camp"" --- a bit too much, if you want to know the truth. It seems to be a film that was written ""backwards,"" around the shocking ending, and so much intricate detail was fussed over and invented that it eventually became too much for the script or the cast to carry off successfully in a little over 80 minutes.It's one of those movies that end and you still have many unanswered questions. I believe the answers are ""there"" but the script doesn't allow for enough scenes to adequately render the clues. It's an especially galling problem in the opening scene upon which much of the coherency of the movie later rests. Another chronic problem is the abysmal level of the acting. Desiree Gould is either a spectacularly bad actress or she was trying way, way too hard. Mike Kellin's performance careens from incoherent to embarrassing way too often to be salvageable, and Karen Fields as the standard bitch-girl has all the wit and depth of a bridge and tunnel extra on ""Jersey Shore."" What SC does have going for it is Felissa Rose. Her woodenness actually works to her advantage and her deliberately invoked catatonia really works to create some interest and mystique around her character in the few times she does verbalize. I also found the opening credit montage eerie and well photographed. Some of the murders were inventive and refreshingly brutal for its time period, others are biz-as-usual.It really adds up to a big case of first-time director-itis. Hiltzik desperately needed someone to tell him to look HARDER for better actors, to CUT 2-3 minutes off the five minute softball scene that adds nothing to the movie, to ADD scenes that more explicitly spell out the nuances in his overly complex, if not intriguing, storyline. In short, it needed another producer besides Hiltzik to shape things a bit more.It could have been the slasher genre's answer to ""Psycho,"" if it had been a little more finely crafted. Instead, it's a ""cult"" fave for people with an obsession over the character of Mozart, who has a total of about 3 lines in the picture. Whatever works for you, I guess.",Sleepaway Camp

I was watching a documentary on horror films and they had mentioned SLEEPAWAY CAMP as a notable film from the decade. The problem is that they gave away the reason it was notable!!!! So I watched it out of curiosity. The truth is that up until the twist ending it is a very below average slasher film. It has no tension, humor, suspense or scares. It is horribly acted even for a film of this kind. It is like FRIDAY THE 13TH in that it takes place in a summer camp. The basic story is about a young quiet girl that is bullied at the camp by most of her counterparts. She doesn't speak to anyone except her cousin and a boy that takes interest in her. The killings are pretty standard stuff, not the worst I have ever seen but they have no real shock value or scares when they occur. It us unintentionally funny a lot of the time. So the only reason to see this film is its final 2 minutes when there is a supposed ""twist"" ending. I have to say that if I didn't know about it beforehand it would have really shocked me. I have to say that it was an interesting way to wrap the film up. The last image I have to say is chilling. If the rest of the film would have been this clever it would have been much better!!!

84,nammage,Not a Typical Slasher Film,7,2 November 2017,"I'm not one to review films that already have so many reviews. So, I'm not really going to. I'm 40 years old and I've never heard of this film; which is odd seeing how I've seen a lot of horror films and films in general. From the very beginning I didn't think I was going to like it mainly because of the acting which is primarily horrible throughout but I've seen enough indie films to discard that impression and keep going. This film, for the type of film it is, actually addresses some serious issues, especially for its time (early 1980s). Topics like molestation, child abuse, bullying, homosexuality, and transgenderism. Some very serious topics for an indie slasher film. I like how the killer just doesn't kill indiscriminately. That's a problem with some slasher films: everyone's fair game but doesn't really play into the psychosis of the character (usually told in flashbacks or opening scenes; such as with this film) and just makes it about the kill rather than the purpose of it. There's purpose to the kills in this film which makes for a better film. There's also a bittersweet romantic side to this which I found ironic, at times.There's actually hints throughout the film that shows that the character Angela isn't just some shy and quiet girl because of what happened to her father and sibling shown in the beginning of the film. I always felt bad for her, throughout. She's tormented and bullied constantly by some of the kids and some of the adults. Some try to protect her but to no avail. Her cousin is always there for her, almost too there for her; it's like: what is it that he knows that we don't? Of course the ending tells us what he knows and I kind of felt he was like the greatest cousin ever though his mother was a nutjob; of course, I had that impression of her from the beginning of the film. She already seemed as if she had few screws loose.I'm a technical rater, when you've seen as many films and TV shows as I have, typically that's what one becomes. On a technical basis, it's a 4/10. Most of the acting is horrible. The direction and writing is subpar. Even the music isn't very good (compositionwise). As I said above: it does delve into some serious issues; mainly bullying and for even taking the chance on that, especially with the surprise ending, I'd give it an 8/10. So, 6.3/10. I'll round that up.",Sleepaway Camp
85,kylehaines96,"It's A Classic, But Not In My Eyes(BOMB/0 Stars Out Of ****)",1,6 December 2012,"A lot of people in the horror community refer to Sleepaway Camp as a horror classic and should be viewed by people who love movies like Friday The 13th. Well I love Friday The 13th, but My God do I hate Sleepaway Camp. I don't Have a top 10 list like Transformers Dark Of The Moon but I do have at least 4 main problems that I can elaborate on.The first problem I had is the main character of Angela Baker played by Fellissa Rose. Now when the movie started I thought her character was developed really well, But the only problem is that they barley have this character speak throughout the whole film. I understand that Her ""Brother""(You will see why in a little bit) and her father were killed in a boating accident and she is shy. But if you're are going to camp to meet people You have to speak at least once or twice. She speaks about a total of 20-30 words in the film. She does spout classic lines like ""I Don't Know"" and ""Thank You Very Much."" The second problem is the overall general story. This film is a complete Friday the 13th rip-off, But every time I say that to somebody who likes the film they say they are completely different. Well lets see, They both have kids go to a camp out in the middle of the woods, and a killer who is not revealed until the end. SAME! They are the same movies! Only Friday The 13th was much more better.The third problem I had is The sexualization of underage children. What I mean by that is this movie piles on sex appeal for kids who are 13 or 14 years old in this movie. If that was not creepy enough you have the character of the pedophile chef who I won't go into detail with because if I do talk about him it's going to make me puke and you and I don't want that.MAJOR SPOILERS BELOW! Please do not continue if you have not seen the film, although I don't know why you would want to.The fourth and final problem is the ending. Angela Goes into the woods to have some ""business"" with a boy. Two older campers come across her and as she turns around you see that she is not only the killer or a girl, she is a BOY! They show you everything, Refer to problem 3 for more of that. Also she is the killer. This is the classic twist ending that everyone remembers but in all honesty, why? Sure she is disturbed after her father and Sister(Now you get it) Angela died in the boating accident Peter the brother of Angela was turned into a girl by his aunt who went mentally insane after the accident. But for me this is not an affective ending because I can't have emotion for a character who doesn't speak or do anything in the movie.The final verdict for the film Sleepaway Camp is a BOMB or 0 stars out of 4. It also earns my seal of disapproval meaning I urge you not to see this film. This film is held back by The main character, completely unoriginal story, Sexualization of children and that Godforsaken ending. This film has no redeeming factors. But the good news is that it has four sequels that I have to sit through and the next 2 have Bruce Springsteen's Sister Pamela Springsteen as Angela.

87,Tromafreak,Fade To Green: The History of Sleepaway Camp,7,18 August 2009,"Back In the early 80's, the flood gates opened for anyone and everyone who fancied themselves a Horror director. As usual, mainstream ruled with such bores as A Nightmare On Elm Street. Then, you got your standard B-Horror, with greatness like Basket Case. And even the amateurs got in on the fun, with shot-on-video atrocities like Horror House On Highway 5, yeah, Z-Horror The point is, there's a hell of a lot of 80's horror out there, probably too much, but one in particular has always stuck out in my mind. Sleepaway Camp is a bit different than other Camp-Slashers from that era. Sure, it takes place at a typical camp, with typical kids getting into typical trouble. Sure, there is a killer, and yes, everything seems really predictable, and to an extent, it is, but you don't know, if you haven't seen this, you just don't know. There are bad things going on at Camp Arawak, and who is doing this is not what makes Sleepaway Camp so Earth-shattering, it's why. Why would someone want to do those terrible things to innocent kids and counselors, and even that cook? Ultimately, It may not turn out to be a very good reason, but there is one, nonetheless. All I can say (without spoilers) is that, regardless of what you think of Sleepaway Camp, that final image will be branded into your mind forever. And then there's the sequels. Parts 2 and 3. Different director, different Angela (Pamela Springsteen), different vibe, different everything. Sleepaway Camp 2 and 3 are your typical watered-down. late-80's slashers, packed with cute puns and lifeless killings. Part 4, on the other hand, was never even finished, which I find funny, yet not all that surprising. And then there was Part 5, Return To Sleepaway Camp. Don't listen to the nay sayers. This film has many enemies, which makes no sense, because I found it to be quite hilarious, as well as brutal. There's even a part 6 on the way!! The masses would consider Jason Voorhees as THE 80's icon of horror, although I know the truth, but no matter what they do, I'll never tell. For more in underrated, yet traumatizing 80's Slashers, Silent Night, Deadly Night. should do quite nicely. I would recommend a double feature with this one. What started as completely mediocre, turns out to be a flat-out masterpiece of terror, and the cult it has developed over the years is much deserving. This is essential 80's Horror if there ever was such a thing. This is Sleepaway Camp. 10/10",Sleepaway Camp
88,Jacques98,"Sorry, guys, but the ending was not original.",2,9 September 2008,"The majority of Sleepaway Camp is just an average slasher movie, as could probably be guessed. Kids and camp workers get killed off in creative waysyou've seen the plot in every slasher movie ever made. But as the movie tries to ask the clichéd question of who did it, I could only ask: who cares? It will just be the person the director thinks we'll least expect, so why even bother trying to figure it out? And, seriously, why can't the killer in slasher movies ever just be a random guy who used to sell soup but thought killing was cooler? Why do slasher movie killers always HAVE TO be someone who at least gets half the screen time? In that aspect, Sleepaway Camp is a clone of every other slasher ever made. You can guess what scenes will end up kills and what scenes will end up wannabe Lifetime TV drama scenes. You can guess who the killer is by the end of the first 10 minutes. There is nothing new here, and what isn't new isn't any better than other slashers. I'd take Friday the 13th over this any dayit was better done, less cheesy, had more blood, and was less predictable.Though the last few moments reveal one of the weirdest possible endings the movie could have had, it was yet again nothing new or original. The twist has been done in countless 50's movies, along with some modern dramas. Just because the twist in the end was the first time it was done in the horror genre doesn't mean it wasn't done and done again in other genres. The lack of originality and the lack of quality make this just another slasher. But at least it tried.The only reason I don't give Sleepaway Camp the worst possible rating is because it was entertaining for the most part, and it tried. It tried to be different, and I like that. This movie tried and failed, but that's better than not trying at all. (Sorry to sound like a cliché football coach.) Can you remember the last movie that tried to be different?2/10",Sleepaway Camp
89,geminiredblue,The Worst Slasher Flick Ever Made!!!,1,7 October 2011,"From the late 70s to around 1984, the first batch of slasher movies would hit the cinema in force. Right at the end of the 70s, we got HALLOWEEN- the creme-de-la-creme of all slashers in my opinion- which was shortly followed in the 80s by MY BLOODY VALENTINE (the original), ""Friday the 13th"", A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET, and THE PROWLER. These early works were marked with a certain degree of innocence that later slasher flicks threw out in favor of smart-ass characters and more elaborate bloody deaths. Granted, at times, the earlier films could be wild and unhinged. But not like later installments in any one of the series I mentioned above. However, there is one truly bizarre series that emerged during that early period. SLEEPAWAY CAMP is a genuinely horrific movie, but in this case that's not an advantage. In order for a horror film to be successful, it must play a balancing act between grossing out the viewer while keeping the viewer entertained and glued to his (or her) seat. On the first count, SLEEPAWAY CAMP delivers in abundance. Unfortunately on the second count, it's not happening with this film! There is a perverse atmosphere surrounding this whole thing. The setting is a summer camp for young children. All the adults seem to be child molesters, rapists or otherwise some-kind-of-predators. The main character is quiet young Angela who was traumatized years ago. She witnessed her gay uncles in bed, among several other events. At camp, she makes friends with a young boy named Paul. (Bad name to have in a horror movie!) Bodies start cropping up, and yet the owner of the camp still refuses to close down. The deaths are pretty inventive, but ugly as sin! And please don't get me started on the shocking and thoroughly disgusting ending. To this day, some ten years later, I still have that last image emblazoned on my mind. Please gentle viewer, hear my cry: DON'T WATCH THIS FILM... EVER! Don't even bother with the sequels, they're just as bad!",Sleepaway Camp
90,bababear,Still Sleazy After All these Years,8,1 July 2007,"SLEEPAWAY CAMP was on the Independent Film Channel Friday night and I watched it, as much as anything, to see if my memory of it was accurate after some twenty odd years.Yep. It was just as weird as it was in the 1980's. It's not my imagination.Veteran character actor Mike Kellin (the only name I recognized in the cast) concludes a lengthy career playing the director of a summer camp that's a little short of paradise. After the very strange Angela comes to camp with her cousin things start getting really nasty and the corpses start accumulating, but the camp stays open. Why? Two compelling reasons. The camp's owners want the money, and if they shut it down and sent everyone home the movie would have been twenty minutes long.This is as unpleasant a group of foulmouthed youngsters as you'll find this side of SOUTH PARK. And when the slaughter starts in earnest nobody is spared the psycho's wrath: some very young children are killed. Offscreen, sure, but it was still a shock.And the ending- which I'm not going to reveal even though most people posting on this board take it for granted that everyone has seen the film- is a prize. That last shot of the killer was a shocker twenty years ago and, even knowing that it's coming, still packs a punch.What's most surprising about the film, though, is that the people who made it didn't go on to bigger things. There's a lot of raw talent at work here. Even with a small budget the movie looks and sounds professionally made.But that's how Hollywood works. Everyone involved in EVAN ALMIGHTY, which cost $175 million to make and is emptying theatres faster than a fire alarm, will go on to bigger projects because they worked on a $175 million movie. The people who made THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT, which cost almost nothing and made money hand over fist, go nowhere because they worked on such a small project.William Goldman said it best.

91,ryan-10075,Interesting Kills and a Memorable Shocking Ending,6,9 May 2021,"Certainly a film any slasher fan needs to watch. In addition it has an ending that should hang on for a long time. I first saw this back in the early 90s and it has stuck with me this whole time. Not saying that the ending alone makes it worthwhile to watch or the only reason, but it is what makes it even more memorable.Ricky (Jonathan Tiersten) and his cousin Angela (Felissa Rose) are off to Camp Arawak for the summer. Ricky has been there before so shows his cousin around. Angela is extremely shy and doesn't have much to say which just brings her the bullies to pick on her. So Ricky has to stick up for her as well. Unlike FRIDAY THE 13TH this movie and its sequels actually show the camp in full swing, which is a breath of fresh air and I don't lean so heavily on the fact that FRIDAY THE 13TH had to be a big influence. Some of the campers or councillors or super creepy and disgusting cooks start getting knocked off one by one. Like FRIDAY it is a bit of a who-done-it as you don't know who the killer is. But even if you can figure out who it is it's still better than the who-done-it FRIDAY did. Film also has interesting kills to keep things fresh. Writer/Director Robert Hiltzik shows that if a low-budget horror flick is done properly it can be worth watching.",Sleepaway Camp

94,Mr_Censored,A Somewhat Campy Sleeper.,6,9 February 2010,"Whether Siskel and Ebert liked it or not, slasher films were big business in the 80's and it seemed to be that if you had a cast of young, horny adolescents to wipe out, you were guaranteed success. One of just many films to capitalize on this, ""Sleepaway Camp"" followed in the wake of the highly successful ""Friday the 13th"" franchise in bringing yet another campy tale of horny campers and the slaughter that ensues. Although seeming cheap and exploitive on the surface, the film attempts to differentiate itself from the competition by introducing a young girl in Angela (Felissa Rose) to root for, instead of the usual cardboard characters that usually pad out this sort of film.Now granted, there's plenty of bad acting and stereotypes to go around (especially when it comes to the camp counselors) but with credible performances by the younger end of the cast, the film rises above it's somewhat cheap nature. The death scenes are creative and are effectively achieved by some classic POV shots, but unfortunately they occur mostly off-screen and are consequently rendered ineffective. It certainly can't match the suspense of ""Halloween"" or the inventiveness of the original ""Friday the 13th,"" but writer/director Robert Hiltzik makes sure you at least have fun while feeling for its main lead, giving the film a bit more soul than the average slasher.What ""Sleepaway Camp"" will be remembered for, though, is its twist-ending that is likely to leave your jaw on the floor and beg a repeat viewing. Even though the film hints at it from time to time, it's careful not to completely give it away, and what results is a final image that will haunt you for days and which has been talked about incessantly for the past three decades since its release. Genre fans will appreciate its charm and be rewarded by something just slightly left-of-center. Four sequels were produced -- all of varying quality and success -- with a fifth currently in the works.",Sleepaway Camp
95,RockPortReview,An 80's Horror Classic!,10,6 February 2010,"Sleepaway Camp 1/26/2010After Friday the 13th redefined the horror genre in 1980, it set off a load of imitator's. Sleepaway Camp was made in 1983 and is the best of these. Sleepaway has also spawned several sequels with varying degrees of quality. The story is quite simple; it involves a mysterious killer in a summer camp (Camp Arawak). Unlike the ""Friday"" movies these kids are only 12 year olds and probably could not be made in today's prudish, politically correct society.Camp Arawak is very reminiscent of real 80's summer camps. The kids are free of parental supervision and totally unrestrained to do whatever they want. The counselors are young twenty something's who really do care for the kids and take their jobs somewhat seriously. Our main character is a painfully shy and withdrawn girl named Angela. He dad and sister died in a boating accident when she was little. One summer her crazy aunt Martha sends her and her cousin Ricky to Camp Arawak. Being an outsider Angela is mercilessly teased and picked on by the other girls, especially the popular girl Judy. Ricky and the boys all have crushes on Judy, mainly because she has boobs. The story takes an honest and true to life perspective of what it's to be a twelve year old boy. Ricky does his best to protect his cousin from her tormenters but he has his own agenda. Angela eventually becomes friends with Paul, a nice kid who really wants to be her friend and maybe more. The supporting characters from the other kids to the counselors are all very 80's and are very ""New York"". The hair, the fashions, and some of the dialogue is quite laughable but also very endearing. It is very honest about what really goes on at summer camps, except with the murders. As people start dying off in pretty creative ways, the suspects start to mount up and the camp owner wants to keep the news private. But when the murders continue and people start freaking out they all go into survival mode. There is a mega shock ending on par with The Sixth Sense that really made this movie a horror hit. On of the reasons this movie was so good is that the characters act like real people and we really care about them as the viewer. This is something that the horror genre has lost in recent years. Surprisingly there was little to no blood in Sleepaway which is also another testament to its unique appeal.",Sleepaway Camp
96,Jared_Andrews,Completely Nonsensical movie with an Overrated Ending,3,31 August 2018,"This is a film mostly known for its twist ending, which I won't spoil. Maybe I should spoil it, though, because this film came out over 30 years ago. But, I still won't spoil it. I'll just talk about other interesting parts of the movie.'Sleepaway Camp' has a simple premise: kids and counselors spend their summer at a typical sleepaway camp, and everything seems normal and happy. Then someone starts killing people. Boom! There's your horror movie.The two primary characters are cousins, Ricky and Angela. Ricky is an outgoing, fun kid who is very protective of his extraordinarily shy cousin. Nearly everyone else at the camp, aside from a couple kind counselors, is either a sexual deviant or an outrageous movie bully. As the kids arrive at the camp, one cook utters in the grossest way possible something along the lines of, ""fresh meat."" Then another cook replies, ""man, those kids are too young."" Then the first cook says, ""there's no such thing as too young."" Then they all chuckle at their perverted co-worker's lust for children. It's the first of many alarming sexual misdeeds. They only get worse from here. There's attempted forced sexual contact. There's a 16-year-old that sets up a date with a 60-year-old man. None of this is presented as unusual. The same goes for the mysterious deaths that happen in the camp. The guy in charge just sweeps everything under the rug, insists that these are accidents, and lets the kids stick around, even though one of them is clearly a murderer. It's lazy, unbelievable writing that's completely irrational, but it happens anyway because if anyone behaved rationally, everyone would leave the camp and the movie would be over.The murderer's identity is meant to be a mystery, but it's pretty obvious early on. His or her identity is hidden by use of first-person camera-reminiscent of 'Halloween'-during the murders, which are depicted in gruesome fashion. Within the film exists a puzzling paradox. The story is told with a light touch, but all the events are dark and disturbing. Every vicious insult or creepy remark rolls off the back of the recipient (except for the killer, who seems to be the only one remotely bothered by the atrocious behavior of everyone at the camp). The awfulness of the murders and bullying are exceeded only by the acting. Not a single actor was any better than abysmal. It's extremely obvious that they're acting; none of it feels real. Overall, the movie is mostly terrible, but fans rave about the ending, which is moderately surprising, I suppose. But it's certainly not enough to redeem the crap fest that made up the preceding 90 minutes.",Sleepaway Camp
97,MamadNobari97,So We're Just Giving Away 10s and 9s Eh?,4,23 September 2021,"So you're just gonna give this movie a 10 because of one ending twist? This how you make a ""masterpiece""?

I actually was laughing at the ending twist and laughing more at people finding it scary. Ok, the twist is a little shocking and you don't see it coming, I'll give it that, but it doesn't make the movie any more good, it only makes it goofier.The acting is beyond terrible and sometimes infuriating. For the first half of the movie I wanted someone to punch Angela in the face really bad, I hated how he just sat there like a fkn alien and just looked at everyone without blinking.Acting and dialogue is terrible and the movie isn't even a slasher, if it wasn't for the profanity it would've easily gotten a PG-13. There's barely any blood and we don't see half of the deaths.I get that if you watched this movie when you were younger you might remember it better, but please watch it again and take your nostalgia glasses off and stop giving every movie you see a 10/10, HOW is a movie 10/10 if the acting, dialogue, plot is so terrible?Just go watch the ending twist on youtube, unless you want to go through 1:20 hour of kids and adults yelling and making noises and bad acting and mediocre slash and ""horror"".",Sleepaway Camp
98,LanceBrave,"The High-Strung, Melodramatic, Trashy World of ""Sleepaway Camp""",6,7 July 2014,"Throughout the early eighties, the market was saturated with cheap slashers. Many of these quickie films were set at summer camps, playing off the success of the wildly popular-profitable ""Friday the 13th"" series. Some of these films, like the hyper-gory ""The Burning,"" have become cult favorites. Others, like ""Summer Camp Nightmare,"" aren't well-known. But there's no camp-set eighties slasher flick cult-ier then 1983's ""Sleepaway Camp."" The movie is most notorious for its gender-bending twist ending. Yet the conclusion is hardly the only odd thing about the film. ""Sleepaway Camp"" is one of the weirdest films from the first wave of American slashers.This is mostly thanks to the movie's implacable tone. ""Sleepaway Camp"" does not exist in our reality. The film is a horribly uneven mixture of nightmare images, camp, a low budget, unexpected subtext, and mean-spirited violence. The film's opening credits are set over shots of an empty camp, the voices of far-off children playing, a genuinely eerie moment. Early on, one of the camp chefs makes lewd comments towards the prepubescent kids. The other chef reacts not by reporting the man but by laughing off the would-be pedophile's behavior. All of the characters act in this exaggerated, trashy manner. Meg the camp councilors, despite being older then the other kids, still picks on shy, socially awkward Angela. ""Pick on"" isn't even the right word, as her language is highly abusive. Despite brutally dispatching the pedophilic chef, ""Sleepaway Camp"" also features a romance between teenage Meg and fifty-something camp owner Mel. The movie doesn't treat this behavior as predatory.The movie appears to be an earnest attempt to create a frightening experience. However, any attempt at horror is undermined by how unintentionally hilarious most of the film is. The acting from all involved is terrible. Felissa Rose's lead performance as Angela is somnambulist, characterized by flat line-reading and unblinking stares. Karen Fields as bully Judy seems unsure of how to handle her outrageous dialogue, delivering it in meaty lumps. The rest of the slasher fodder have a similar problem, giving broad performances without even the basic ability to read lines convincingly. As bad as the teens are, the adult actors give even worst performances. Desiree Gould is Aunt Martha and gives one of the strangest performance in any '80s horror film. Her dialogue is spoken in a spaced-out, antiqued manner. Gould honestly seems to have wander out of a David Lynch movie. As bizarre as Gould is, Mike Kellin as Mel is much worst. The mush-mouth Kellin is given some of the heaviest dialogue in the film, a feat beyond the actor's ability. Mel's obsession with keeping the camp open, even with bodies piling up, is inexplicable. When he deduces Ricky is behind the deaths, he brutally beats the kid. An adult beating a child should never be hilarious but Kellin's tone-death performance and the movie's melodramatic delivery makes it funny.The hilarity doesn't stop there. ""Sleepaway Camp"" also serves as a time capsule for fashion in 1983. Pastels are the color of choice. One of the male camp counselor wears tiny shorts hiked up to his crotch. The fashion isn't the only source of unintentional humor. The sole cop in the movie reappears at the end, his real mustache replaced with fuzzy duct tape. The movie could be commended for having the kids act like kids. They let loose explicit profanity, play mean-spirited pranks, and generally act like entitled d-bags. The nasty way they act is so unexpected that it frequently becomes hilarious. All of this characterizes the high-strung, melodramatic, trashy world of 'Sleepaway Camp."" The whole movie is also characterized by discomfort with, not just teen sexuality, but human sexuality in general. The film has a strong homoerotic undercurrent. At the beginning, we see Angela and Ricky's father with a male friend. Turns out, that friend is their father's lover. In addition to this element, the film is full of half naked teen boys. They wear mid-drift barring shirts, go skinny dipping, and shove their bare butts in other kids' face. The whole film is focused on the kids' budding sexuality in a greasy, unseemly fashion.Of course, the biggest queer element is the infamous ending. Turns out, Angela is actually a boy who has lived his life as a female. The film lets this twist explain away Angela's murderous desire, a deeply transphobic element that probably wasn't thought about much in 1983. The film doesn't have time for that, as its final image of a naked Angela, penis in full sight, is bizarre. Not because of the nudity but because the character's face freezes in an animalistic growl while an eerie hiss escapes her throat.Befitting the off-putting tone, the film's murders are unusual. A man is burned with boiling water, his body covered with bursting blisters. One kid drowns while another is stung to death by bees, the camera lingering on their brutalized bodies. A stab to the back and an arrow in the neck are more typical but pulled off convincingly. The most notorious death happens off-screen. Judy is somehow killed with a curling iron, the implication being that she was stabbed in a very uncomfortable place. As opposed to most eighties slashers, the kids here are played by visibly young actors. That such violence is being inflicted on young children is one more thing that makes ""Sleepaway Camp"" a mean-spirited mess of a film.That mess isn't for everybody. Initially, it wasn't even for me. I found the film difficult to swallow on first viewing. However, ""Sleepaway Camp"" has grown on me over subsequent watches. The film is utterly unique among slashers and too generally weird not to be memorable.",Sleepaway Camp
99,lagriff05,I shouldn't like this so much,7,30 December 2008,"This is a pretty terrible movie, but I'd be lying if I said I didn't find it entertaining anyway. And actually, this movie is pretty damned shocking at the end, too. But I won't spoil that for you. Sleepaway Camp has some pretty bone-headed characters, but most of them are actually kind of fun to watch, as you'll see by the end, and they're better than a lot of the stock characters in the Friday or Halloween films. The romance is silly, and the gore is badly done for the most part (except the bee hive scene, that was cool) but the camp setting is charming and you'll feel at home there, oddly enough, once the movie is over and you're staring with your mouth agape at the screen at the disgustingly shocking ending. The whole thing seems infinitely more screwed up once you know the twist, too, and yet you still can't stop watching.I really did try to dislike this, but Sleepaway Camp is just too likable, even despite its bizarre nature and crazy gore. It's like that annoying cousin who won't go away, and yet who you end up loving anyway. God dammit.",Sleepaway Camp
100,Golden_Hope,Accidental Masterpiece,10,23 May 2020,"This movie is by now means a ""good movie"" but it just has something so special about it.It has so many Issues like for starters no one could act their way out of a paper bag but when your watching it just adds to its charm in such a strange way. It also makes it hilarious. The first scene with Aunt Martha is just so funny for all the wrong reasons.The effects used in this movie are also like two ends of a spectrum some are so cleaver and creative like gelatine being pumped through a pipe underneath a man to simulate blisters pulsating and then you have half a raspberry being used as a bee sting. Which once again is hilarious.The story is also great. It has something that the other summer camp 80s movie don't have.I think if you strip away all it's issues like the acting and the budget that must have been about $17 there is such a solid idea. But I also think that if you stripped all the issues away it wouldn't be as fun and as charming and creative.So I would say definitely check this movie out if you like 80s horror or if you love bad movies because the is the best bad movie you will ever see.",Sleepaway Camp
101,tex-42,Laughably bad movie,1,2 July 2000,"To think that this movie spawned two sequels just sends shudders down my spine.  The plot concerns Angela, a shy girl, who is spending her first summer at camp with her cousin.  Angela is constantly teased and humiliated, and it seems anyone involved in the teasing ends up either dead or close to it.  The only thing that really sets this movie apart is the bizarre ending that is totally out of place with the rest of the movie.  It does not make this movie any better, it just is very odd to say the least.  In terms of acting and writing, it seems that this movie was made with some child's lunch money.  The ""plot"" jumps around constantly and the ""actors"" seem to have been picked from the reject list of ""The Gong Show"" so wooden and awful are their performances.  It's better that you just save yourself the agony and avoid this movie.",Sleepaway Camp

I Still Love This Movie",10,22 August 1999,"I first saw this movie in the theater when it first came and since then, I've gotten a tape of it and still have it and watch it from time to time.  First of all, I really wanted to clear something up that no one seems to have caught onto in all the other comments about this film.  The Mother figure in the film--has much in common with Ru Paul.  Take a closer look at it.  It's a guy in drag.  This is the basis for the story.  It actually took me awhile to figure that out, but if you see it again, there it is.  So it wasn't just that the Mother was nuts, there was alot more going on there.  To better explain the plot, it was about a gay couple, one get's killed, the other goes nuts over it and turns into The Mother.  This is actually one of my favorite horror films.  It's just so classic.  You get all the interesting, creative death scenes and a wonderful shocker of an ending that has never been duplicated successfully in any other film.  Yes, the acting and most of the story is ridiculous, however, that's what makes it so cool.  It's a fun to watch film, a true cult classic.

The characters are always busy, unlike too many B movies (and TV) where everyone stops to dialogue and background characters are just milling around. The pacing is good. The murders make sense.

It's not completely over the top, but has a huge and obvious element of that. Most obviously in beginning is the ridiculous accident, then the very ridiculous aunt. So, you have to be ok with a large element of that, or you will simply hate this.I can't even imagine this being made today. American Pie is quite chaste in comparison. This is Porky's era and in some ways more extreme than Porky's.I think partly that's because Porky's was a period piece, and this is comfortably set in the then contemporary. But also, many of these actors are considerably younger than those in Porky's.Part of what's weird is how darn tight the jeans are and how short the shorts are.

This movie in my opinion is hindered by it's better sequel. I would much rather watch Sleepawy Camp II: Unhappy Campers before this film just because II is such a classic and one of the first real slapstick horror films. This is just your average fair. It has a lot of death and that is a good thing, it just does not have that much originality to it. I know a lot of you will be saying what about the ending that was real original. I say besides the graphic male genitalia shot it has about the same shock factor that Wes Craven's Deadly Blessing had and that movie came out about three years earlier. Both films have the same conclusion for the killer's motives. This film just serves as a blood bath and that is what it is good for, if you want a crowning achievement watch Sleepaway Camp II: Unhappy Campers or the next follow up in the series, Sleepaway Camp III: Teenage Wasteland (Love That Title!).

109,80sHorror,Summer Camp Horror...With A Twist!,10,21 February 2015,"Sleepaway Camp is first and foremost, another summer camp slasher film. A very popular slasher subgenre originated with the 1980 classic Friday the 13th. Angela and Ricky are young teenagers off to camp Arawak for the summer, Ricky the likable popular type, and Angela, the quiet and 'different' type. When all kinds of scuzzy camp regulars begin to give Angela a hard time, they start dying rather brutally...much to the dismay of the camp's burnt out owner Mel (Mike Kellin). Sleepaway Camp is a slasher film, however, it goes a bit deeper than that, what gives Sleepaway Camp its distinction, is the bizarre homosexual themes running throughout the film. Why they are there are anybody's guess,but from the strange transvestite (?) Aunt Martha, to Angela's gay father, the truly shocking and disturbing final shot and more, Sleepaway Camp is sick, grisily, twisted, yet always fascinating. Of course, its not always great, many scenes in this film are just laughable, like the melodramatic boating accident at the film's start, or the character that wears a shirt with her name on it, and even the scenes with Chef Artie, the local camp sleazeball. Sleepaway Camp however, always manages to be charming, despite its warped themes and lurid subject matter, this one certainly isn't for everybody, but those with a taste for something not quite the norm will find much to savor here with Sleepaway Camp, a truly strange film that stands in a tired subgenre, but stands out as a unique achievement-even if partially a fluke.",Sleepaway Camp

Its definitely a decent movie for when it was made. But could really benefit from a High budget remake.",Sleepaway Camp
111,jamhorner,Very Unhappy Campers,8,2 December 2007,"I remember viewing this movie when it came out, me and my friends snuck into the theater when we were like 13 or 12, and we were dead afraid but we were defiantly given a huge slap to our sexuality when we saw the ending. We left the back entrance of the movie theater wondering what the heck just happened and if we should brag to our school chums about what we just viewed. Needless to say, we did and we got ridiculed. But I loved this movie anyway. A bit graphic and weird, but a great movie nonetheless.This was another great cheesy, sleazy 80's slasher film that would forever strike me as one of the best horror movies with a great twist ending. Essentially this movie is about a girl who falls for a boy while she is at camp, then thing begin to go horribly wrong and people begin to die. Oddly enough, the romantic rivals of this girl are the ones being offed. The end when she is stroking the head of her lover and ""she"" is holding his head aloft just gets you. You aren't not expecting at any stretch of the imagination, and its just completely out there that it's haunting. As one critic once put it ""Before Crying Game brought it to art houses, Sleepaway Camp brought it to Grindhouses,"" and boy was he ever true. It vaguely hints towards it near the beginning but even still it's a great twist. I also want to mention that the face that Angela makes at the end has left an imprint in my head forever.As far as the technical details are concerned, the acting is pretty good, the screams were ear piercing and the scares were pretty good but it had the feel of Friday the 13th, but because of the ending, it was masterfully turned around into a great American cult classic with an unforgettable twist ending. This movie hit me hard and introduced me to a special kind of B-movie that I never knew existed and it ranked up there with The Rats, Scream, The Usual Suspects and Planet of the Apes. The flashbacks, especially near the end had a feel of a Broadway play or musical with a disturbing 1950's feel to it and the mother of ""Angela"" is so horribly creepy with her sweet talkative voice and her nicely dressed body. I think that some of the acting was a bit over the top (i.e. when the kids put shaving cream on some other kid and he poorly attempts to kill them with a knife). So thank you Sleepaway Camp for not letting me forget that classic ending. I Think it's one of those movies were you have to watch and be amazed at how cheesy this movie is but it all leads up to a fantastic ending. I think that it's just a great B-movie with some campy, no pun intended, humor and great yucks and chucks.",Sleepaway Camp
112,hippiedj,Welcome to Camp Hateful Kids! Meet me at the waterfront after the social!,7,14 July 2002,"*CONTAINS SPOILERS* Intended for those who have already seen this film.Sleepaway Camp is primarily a hoot for watching late at night with a bunch of snacks.  The acting is WAY over the top (the way Judy's mouth kept hanging wide open after every accentuated word had me in fits of laughter). The language was excessive in the way that films from the late 1970s and early 1980s loved to shock with that ""Bad News Bears"" syndrome of kids cussing (might as well have changed the name of the camp to Camp Cussinkids!).  The clothes were outrageous (plaid pants, high black socks, short shorts).  The Kids were all just so hateful, and the dialogue was just plain silly except for adding the interesting plot points of two children having a gay dad, and an outrageous Aunt Martha who always wanted a girl in her family and made sure that happened.  If you're not really scared by the suspenseful scenes, that's alright because if you've just seen it for the first time after having seen so many other slasher films, then you just won't be that scared.  But, it all pays off well when the ending arrives. I was indeed surprised and felt rather rewarded.  It does indeed stand on its own from the other summer camp slasher films out there, and for those of us who got the gist of it it's a fun ride.It's very important to address the problem so many had with the ending. Those that felt it was disgusting should not have been watching a film of this kind to begin with!  Just check the other reviewers that said it sickened them to see a naked mans body, full frontal view.  Obviously those comments were made by men (presumably heterosexual of course) and those same men complained that there were no naked women in the film.  If naked women are what you really want to see, I hear there are plenty of them in some porn out there!  For goodness' sake, if you're really so sure you're secure in your own sexuality, then you shouldn't be made uncomfortable by male nudity.  Besides, consider that there are others out there (many women of course) who's tastes are constantly being ignored as to the fact that maybe THEY would like to see some guys' skin once in a while.  So many others took things out of context in the film:  one reviewer complained the boys were touching each other, when in actuality they were either tackling each other or just wrassling.  Think about this:  if it were girls instead of guys doing that, I'll bet that it would not have been perceived as a ""problem"" at all.  If films and entertainment in general are to progress, double standards must be stopped.That said, yes the ending is shocking but mainly because of the ""surprise"" of the moment in the context of the story.  NOT because you get to see a man's genitals.  The film does what it sets out to do:  surprise and shock, that's what it's supposed to do and that's a GOOD thing!Sleepaway Camp is not meant to be high class entertainment, but it at least offers decent entertainment and an interesting enough story.  My advice to the rest of you who are uneasy about the film's homosexuality and male nudity: GET OVER IT.   Now, watch Sleepaway Camp again and enjoy!",Sleepaway Camp
113,thelastblogontheleft,Worth it just for the ending,6,4 November 2017,"Sleepaway Camp, a well-known cult classic among horror enthusiasts, is what I'd consider to be a ""great bad movie"". It was director Robert Hiltzik's first film (and, really, he only went on to direct one other distant sequel) and one he should be pretty proud of, really.The film opens with a dad and two kids playing out on a lake. There are some teenagers nearby driving a speedboat rather recklessly, who tragically crash into the family, killing the father and one of the children. We fast forward 8 years to Angela (Felissa Rose), the survivor of the accident, heading off to Camp Arawak with her cousin Ricky (Jonathan Tiersten), who she now lives with. She is understandably traumatized by the events and extremely shy and quiet as a result, which makes for lots of teasing at camp (and lots of punishment for those who tease).** SPOILERS! **Overall, this is your typical campy (literally and figuratively) teen slasher. It was riding the waves of Friday the 13th (released in 1980) and the similarities are unmistakable — gruesome killings played out in an act of vengeance on camp kids and their counselors. Sounds a bit familiar. But really, who doesn't like a campy teen slasher film?Ricky's mom (Desiree Gould) keeps the weirdness factor up right away with her WILDLY over-the-top acting and just plain bizarre persona.Despite the acting not being the greatest (is it ever?) and the sheer number of short shorts and crop tops (mostly on the muscular male counselors), some of the kills are surprisingly awesome. The counselor getting drowned under the canoe was nothing wild until you see his corpse the next morning with a water snake slithering out of his mouth. The disgusting pervert of a head chef got DRENCHED in boiling water and the length of time he is allowed to go on screaming in agony is, well, satisfying in context. Or Judy (Karen Fields) getting killed with a hair curler, where it's more about what we don't see than what we do.This movie is also now responsible for one of my favorite moments ever: when one of the other kids says ""Eat sh*t and die, Ricky!"" and Ricky responds, in all seriousness, ""eat sh*t and live, Bill"". Brilliant.But the real reason we will all remember this movie forever: THE ENDING, HOLY GODDAMN. Honestly, Angela being the killer didn't surprise me for a second. I thought that was obvious from the very beginning. But the twist of her actually being Paul and raised as Angela because crazy Aunt Martha ""always wanted a daughter"" was a doozy, and the visual of his surprisingly-muscular-for-a-pre-teen's naked body drenched in blood as he hisses maniacally was just wow. Wow. Wow.On top of it being a WILD leap into left field, it made the motivation behind the killings a bit deeper surprisingly deep for an early 80s slasher film, really. I wish it had been explored more and given the attention it deserved, but it introduced these sort of half- baked ideas of sexual repression, trauma from sexual molestation, and being forced to live in a body that isn't your own into the film, which was interesting even if not fully fleshed out.Ultimately, worth a watch JUST for the ending alone. For real.",Sleepaway Camp

The movie does not compromise on its weirdness, filthy characters, unfiltered dialogue, and gore, which is refreshing, compared to most movies from about 2010 to now that are either politically-correct or scared to take risks.

However, after viewing it for a few minutes you will realize that it is much more than that. This is a rare type of horror flick that commands the viewer's attention and keeps it from beginning to end. Because of the surprisingly superb performance by the young cast, this film keeps you just as interested in the subplots involving the campers as it does the blood and guts. The murder sequences are truly horrific...a cook is boiled in water, a young man is attacked by hornets while taking a dump, there is a brutal shower murder and a seamless arrow-through-the neck effect. On top of all of this, Sleepaway Camp boasts one of the most shocking and surprising ""twist"" endings in horror history.

119,RomanJamesHoffman,A hidden gem,8,22 July 2015,"In the wake of the astronomical financial success of John Carpenter's 'Halloween' and Sean Cunningham's 'Friday the 13th', slasher films were all the rage. Cheap to produce, formulaic to write, and guaranteed to turn a profit. Inevitably this became very tiresome very fast as audiences became aware that once you've seen a couple of slasher filmsthere's basically no surprises in any other which you care to watch. And yet, 'Sleepaway Camp' bucks this trend in a big way and offers a decent watch for the most part but a horrific climax which you just won't see coming.The plot follows a shy and possibly mute young girl, Angela, whose strange behaviour is the result of being the sole survivor of a tragic boating accident that took the lives of her father and brother several years previously. Since the accident she has lived with her freakish and obsessive aunt and, as the title suggests, is sent to a summer camp along with her protective and loyal cousin, Ricky. Inevitably, the girl's reluctance to speak or take part in the camp activities arouses the ire of the camp bullies who, as the plot progresses, start being killed one by one by an unknown attacker until the final, shocking reveal unmasks a dark and twisted undertow.In its summer camp setting the film was clearly attempting to rip off 'Friday the 13th' and yet (much like 'The Burning' (1981)) is actually a far better film than the original. Whereas I have always found 'Friday the 13th' to simply be one-dimensional fun kills, 'Sleepaway Camp' has well-drawn characters that the audience really cares about. It is easy to identify with the various youthful insecurities portrayed on screen which makes the film much more engaging than it's more famous predecessor. Even the drawing of the bullies themselves offers insights into their vulnerabilities which adds depth to their deaths. But let's not think this is some intense introspective teen drama: it's a Slasher, and the kills are as imaginative as you would expect from a film in a genre defined by gore and grisly murders.and then there's the ending. Apparently, the movie is famous for its final reveal. However, I approached the movie knowing absolutely nothing about it and wasn't even expecting a shock ending or, if anything, I expected a Jason-emerging-from-the-lake shock ending as a nod to 'Friday the 13th'. So for me the ending was genuinely surprising and shocking. Obviously, if you haven't already seen the movie and are reading this review then you know now that there is a twist endingbut still, I think you will be pleasantly surprised.Unfortunately, in a similar way to the aforementioned 'The Burning' the film suffers from its surface similarity to the far more famous 'Friday the 13th'. As a result I can imagine a potential viewer being turned off by imagining something derivative in an already derivative genre. However, if this is you, I entreat you to give 'Sleepaway Camp' a watch, it is far greater than many ""classic"" slashers and deserves much, much more recognition.",Sleepaway Camp

What sets this movie apart from all others is the absolutely twisted and warped ending.

122,FrightMeter,There was a reason that I never went to Summer Camp as a child...,9,12 March 2002,"...and this movie was it!!  You can't deny that this film remains one of the most disturbing in the genre.  From the pure savageness of the murders, to the more-than-shocking ending, it completes its purpose with flying colors. Better than any of the Friday the 13th sequels after Part 2, ""Sleepaway Camp"" is your standard, by the book camp slasher film that was obviously inspired by ""Friday the 13,"" ""The Burning,"" and ""Madman.""  But don't jump to this conclusion just because it takes place at a summer camp.  Nothing is what is seems with this film and the ending will shock you.  ""Sleepaway Camp"" in my opinion, captures the true atmosphere and shenanigans of the summer camp better than any of its predecessors.  The teens look like teens, not 30 year olds, the dialogue and jokes are very typical of youngsters, and the quant, picturesque Camp Arawak looks like a camp you would find near anyone's hometown. In the opening sequence, we witness a father and her two children get brutalized by a freak boat accident.  Flash forward to a few years later where we meet outspoken, smart-mouthed Ricky and his shy, odd cousin Angela on their way to summer camp.  As soon as they arrive, Angela becomes the target of many of the other campers because of her shyness and demeanor.  But soon, those who taunt her turn up dead...murdered in very gruesome ways, from boiling water, to beehives, to a curling iron.  Is the obvious person, Angela, the killer?  Or will little Ricky defend his cousin to the point of murder?  Or is the killer someone totally different and unrelated??  That is the beauty of ""Sleepaway Camp"" and when, in the last scene, when we find out who the killer is, out jaws are on the floor.  As mentioned before in other reviews, the acting is hokey and silly in many parts, and the main story gets distracted in a few places by overly-long pranks and cussing matches among the kids.  But overall, the film works and it works well for the genre.  Trust me...you could do MUCH MUCH worse!!!  I give ""Sleepaway Camp"" a 9 out of 10.  It remains one of my favorite horror films of the 80's and really took quit some risks with it's subject matter for the time period and managed to turn them into a downright creepy, disturbing little film.",Sleepaway Camp

The guy who made the film used money he got from his mother when she died and put it all into this movie which he had written when he was younger.The film follows cousins Angela (Felissa Rose) and Ricky (Jonathan Tierston) at a summer camp in upstate New York. Angela's life has been a tragic one and she doesn't speak. The other campers tease her mercilessly and Ricky has to continuously take up for her.Soon the campers start getting killed off one by one in really gruesome ways. This movie is one of the best of its era and genre and it's amazing how well it turned out since the filmmaker had no experience at the time he made this.

125,movieman89-2,The idea was there but..........,3,13 May 2015,"Hearing and seeing the positive reviews on this, I felt I had to see it. And I'm sorry to say, I was very disappointed.The story was effective and simple with some nice character development but the acting was laughable, that it at the end, it was hard to care. Also the writing was pretty pore. As the victims die off one by one, only one police call took place and everyone else didn't seem concerned as the killings continued. No sense of realism there.What also ruined this film was the direction. During a scene where the camp's cook is horribly burned by boiling water and lies on the floor, screaming in agonising pain. One of the caretaker's finds him and then the camera cuts to the cook screaming and then to the caretaker, in shock. This lasts way too long, which was ridiculousThere were also scenes involving flashbacks of Angela, in a setting where everywhere is black and where she's sitting or standing, there are vibrant colours aiming on her and nowhere else. It seemed like the director was trying to be artistic, but failing.For the cinematography, there were some really nice shots, especially from the killer's point of view, which always works for me.And now the ending, which I wont explain too much because of spoilers. This really frustrated me because when you find out who the killer is, it just cuts to the credits. With no chase scenes or even a fight between the killer and the main character. Another directional error, is that the killer just stands there, looking like a gormless idiot, breathing like an animal. May I ask, what is that about?When the film was rolling the credits, I just sat on the couch in frustration and disappointment. There was a good idea there but it was portrayed terribly. If you guys want to see it, by all means do so. You might enjoy it and see it in a positive way. Everyone has a different opinion at the end of the day.",Sleepaway Camp

127,RetroRick,"quality ""slasher"". Creepy & unnerving",8,16 October 2020,"Wow, this was quite the sub-genre discovery.On the surface this is something you've seen a hundred times before: a murderer running amok in summer amok.But this is different. It feels different almost from the beginning. The kids are uncomfortably young & this makes for uncomfortable viewing the whole way through. Most of them are post-pubescent, some of them seem as though they aren't.There's a reason for everything. The themes as others point out out are equally discomforting, at least not necessarily because of their subject matter but because of their context, all of which becomes clear by the end.Although the violence & 'gore' is limited, it's all done extremely effectively, with maximum impact in terms of erring on the right side of suggestion rather than drab depiction.Again, to second what others have said, this is a film that in many ways, although it is not entirely original in all senses, is ahead of its time.One last note, I would suggest this should be required watching for a certain variety of liberal parents. If you're one the latter, after watching this film, you'll know who what I mean.",Sleepaway Camp
128,culmo80,Kind of Slow But a Great Ending,7,21 March 2011,"Sleepaway Camp took a while to get going with the suspense and a lot of the movie is spent building up relationships and what not.The story follows Angela who survived a horrible boating accident at a lake (pretty sure it's the same lake as the summer camp but I could be wrong). She is sent to live with her peculiar aunt and cousin, who some years later, sends them to Camp Arawak (an odd name, since Arawak were Caribbean indians).Anyway, the shy and silent Angela is the object of ridicule but her cousin defends her, sometimes violently.People begin to have bad accidents, some dying, and its up to the remaining people at the camp to discover who is behind the deaths.Spoilers: I originally thought the aunt was just a horrible actress with over the top performances but I figured there was a reason for this and I turned out to be right. Not quite sane would be an understatement for this woman as we learn that Peter, not Angela survived the boat accident but the crazy aunt always wanted a daughter, so she raised Peter as a girl.This revelation at the end was one of the most unexpected twists in a movie I have seen and is why the movie gets the higher rating than it does.As I mentioned, the movie drags on for a while, with a lot of time devoted to baseball games, socials, pranks, etc, which gave the viewers a nice overview of summer camp but didn't add to the plot. I suppose some of this could have been done to make the audience suspect one of the other campers and indeed, the camp director even suspected Angela's cousin to the point of beating the boy.--End of Spoilers--- The movie was entertaining and had an shocking twist which made it worth watching. I wouldn't include this movie in my must-have horror film collection but it is worthy of renting.",Sleepaway Camp

Yes that her creepy aunt had done a gender reversal was an interesting twist, but she was the obvious culprit from square one.

131,Milo-Jeeder,Another formulaic slasher from the 80s... and then some!,8,28 December 2019,"In ""Sleepaway Camp"", the story begins with a family (a man and his two kids) that is struck by a horrible accident, in which the father and one of the children die. Little Angela, the sole survivor of the gruesome event, is sent to live with her aunt Martha and her protective cousin, Ricky, who is about her age.Many years later, we see Angela and Ricky as teenagers, heading up to a campsite during the summer, much to the girl's dismay, whose (pathological) shyness makes it really difficult for her to socialize.
What initially appears to be an innocent summer camp for kids to have some fun and make friends, turns into a nightmare, as many people begin to get butchered by mysterious someone who lurks around in the shadows. While the owner of the campsite clumsily tries to find out what the heck is going on, the body count increases and it seems like the bullies are at a higher risk of suffering a gruesome death.
In the end, everyone is shocked beyond belief when they find out that the quiet and mousy Angela was behind all the killings, but, as if this wasn't shocking enough, it turns out that Angela is not exactly a girl, she is actually Peter, the sole survivor of the aformentioned family tragedy that happened many years ago. It turns out that the poor Peter was forced to adopt a female identity because his delusional Aunt Martha didn't want to raise another boy in the family and she thought it would be fun to have a girl in the house. Yikes!Aside from the really unexpected plot twist, one of the main reasons why I found ""Sleepaway Camp"" to be so disturbing is because it provides a subtext in which the kids appear as hopeless victims in a world ran by miserable, sick, lascivious, greedy and even plain evil adults, who prey on children and teenagers in order to achieve personal satisfaction and gains. Intentionally or not, Robert Hiltzik, who both wrote and directed the film, gives us a really dark take on reality, by showing the way adults relate to children and teenagers, since most of the adult characters are probably far more terrifying than the deranged Angela/Peter. As a matter of fact, this aspect of the film is somewhat depressing, as it is closer to reality than one would think and probably not something one expects to see in a slasher flick that, at first sight, doesn't intend to provide any message. This is one of the main reasons why ""Sleepaway Camp"" sort of stayed with me over the years.First of all, we have Aunt Martha (played by Desiree Gould), a woman who forces a young boy, who has recently lost his family, to adopt a different gender, just because she already has a boy in the family and doesn't want another one! That's right, my friends, crazy Aunt Martha didn't hesitate to ruin a child's life, just because she thought it would be fun to have a girl in the family (perfectly normal, huh?).
Then, we have Artie, the cook... ugh, this is perhaps one of the most disgusting characters I have seen in a horror flick. Artie is a perverted man, presumably in his thirties, who lusts after kids and who doesn't even bother hiding his sickening proclivities among his peers. When the horrible Artie tells everyone that he wants to get his hands on the helpless kids, one of his co-workers try to explain him that the kids are too young to even understand about sex, Artie claims that ""There is no such thing as being too young"". As if this wasn't disgusting enough, his statement doesn't cause any outrage among the other adults, who actually laugh when he says this. So, in the end, if Artie manages to get away with his behaviour, it's because the rest of the adults are aware of it and don't do anything to stop him. Disturbing, huh?
Another character that is nominated in the category of ""Rotten adults who deserve to be eaten alive by pigeons"" is Mel (played by Mike Kellin), the owner of the campsite. Mel is a greedy old pervert who, even though he soon realizes that the kids are in danger because there's a killer on the lose, refuses to send them back home, because he doesn't want to lose money, something that eventually results in the death of many more kids. As if this wasn't enough, Mel also won't hesitate to beat up a teenage boy, simply because he assumes that he is behind all the killings. Oh, he also smokes cigars next to the kids (but it was the 80s, so that may not be entirely his fault).
Last, but not least, we have Meg... okay, Meg appears to be around 18, so she is not 100% adult, but she's, in fact, one of the camp counselors, who abuses her so-called power to bully our poor Angie (oh, and she also sleeps with Mel, the aformentioned greedy old bastard... yikes!).So, yes, ""Sleepaway Camp"" is a disturbing film, but the way I see it, Angela is one of the many elements that contribute to make it this way. In the end, one could argue that Angela is, to a certain extent, a victim as well.Of course, this is a slasher from the 80s that was filmed with a very limited budget, so, even though the film mostly manages to stay on the ""serious"" side, the unintended hilarity finds a way to make an entrance. The campiness (no pun intended, but I love it, anyway) mostly comes from the over the top acting that, from time to time, feels more like a John Waters flick, rather than a serious horror flick. Besides this, some of the characters are so ridiculous and bizarre that, even during a serious and disturbing scene, I found myself laughing. The scene where old Mel finds his teenage sweetheart's dead body is comedy gold... seriously, I dare you not to laugh at this ridiculous acting.If there's a slasher flick that came out during the slasher fever that took place in the 80s, that succeeded in not becoming another carbon copy of ""Friday the 13th"", that would be ""Sleepaway Camp"". The movie offers all the elements featured in the average slasher formula... and then some.",Sleepaway Camp
132,Ziggy5446,"Worth it, though only because of the ending.",5,15 June 2007,"Sleepaway Camp is an unusual film in that it contains a great deal of homo erotic overtones. It may very well be the only trash horror film from the '80s where the boys show more flesh than the girls. From the numerous shots of shirtless men in shorts that would make Brazilians embarrassed, to the overt cheapening of the girls, director Robert Hiltzik is throwing the entire slasher genre into an uproar by mixing his messages on the kind of gender proclivity that gets you killed in such a scenario.One could easily say it's a cheap Friday the 13th knock-off, but with good 'camp' value. So, therefore, the story is rather familiar. When Ricky and his slightly off-kilter cousin Angela visit Camp Arawak for the summer, they're hoping to spend some quality time away from home. But wouldn't you know it, the place has a problem all its own - a serial killer is on the loose, one who is slicing and dicing his way through the campers.It sure is, however, worth it, though only because of the ending. Angela is really Peter and that Aunt Martha inexplicably decided to raise him as a girl after the accident that killed his sister and hunky dad, a series of flashbacks sheds light on the identity crisis of the film's killer: two men (yes, the hunky guys in the film's opening scene) caress each other in bed, and after witnessing this '50s-PSA spectacle of queer petting, two siblings reach for each using an E.T.-phone-home-pull-my-finger gesture that seems to imply that they're going to ""desire"" each other (in the butt perhaps?).With that being said, sure, the film mimics Friday the 13th's (not entirely the most original film either) summer camp setting, but because it's so hilarious, and the final money shot is so damn creepy, Sleepaway Camp has a string of mysterious bloodshed.",Sleepaway Camp

Sleepaway Camp has that and more! The identity of the killer remains inconspicuous right to the very end, very much like the first Friday the 13th. In the lead up you get your usual high body count slasher flick, but it's somewhat unique because of its tone- a mix of schlocky horror and a certain self awareness to subvert the genres conventions.This also features one of the most unexpected plot twists to a movie of all time!

This one is set at Camp Arawak and there is a killer amongst the kids. Again, the ending is too twisted to reveal, but all the flashbacks will catch you up to speed towards the end of the film. Felissa Rose seems to be the only player in this film who can act. Though she doesn't have many lines, she does appear in most of the scenes.

136,mymangodfrey,"Derivative, icky, homophobic, and generally retrograde...",10,20 July 2018,"...but who are we kidding: Sleepaway Camp is the best summer-camp slasher movie ever made.I compare this movie (and the original, underrated Friday the 13th) to getting on a sketchy-looking carnival ride. The ride looks old, it seems to have been carelessly assembled, and the ride operator is drunk; you never feel that your life is in the hands of capable, trustworthy people, and that's half of the fun.The weird appeal of Sleepaway Camp starts pre-credits, with its bizarre dedication, and continues all the way to the closing credits, with its freeze-frame and its magnificently horrible would-be pop hit, ""Angela's Theme.""I don't know, man. This is obviously an irresponsible movie, with some very outdated ideas about gender and sexuality, but I think we just have to love it like the weird cousin we see at Thanksgiving.As is true with the best cult genre movies: sometimes Sleepaway Camp is so bad it's good, and other times it's just good. (Rarely is it in the boring middle.) Sometimes you're laughing with the movie, and sometimes you're laughing at the movie. Some of the performers are entertaining because they're pretty good actors, and some are entertaining because they're so terrible (but we sense that they don't really care; this production isn't Shakespeare, or a first-step towards stardom).Crazy Aunt Martha, what have you started here?PS: the orchestral musical score is one of the things that's good-good.

When the characters reach the summer camp, it all suddenly clicks into place. The writing starts getting good; characters start to develop, there are some funny snippets of dialogue and realistic scenes of life in a summer camp.Angela is a highly unusual heroine for a slasher film. She hardly speaks until about midway through the picture. She is mercilessly bullied by the other girls, like Sissy Spacek was in ""Carrie.""The funny thing is that the people who run the camp all seem to be on the edge of insanity, from the ranting owner to the paedophile cook. The director must have saved his entire effects budget for the scene involving the boiling water. It is easily the best effects shot in the movie.The twist at the end is the best twist in a slasher movie since the original ""Halloween"" in 1978. The final shot is bizarre, terrifying and the stuff of nightmares. I only saw this movie recently. Had I seen it in 1983 when it came out, I would have been shocked.

The performances of the children didn't really feel forced, and the horseplay and language were true to life when I was a kid. The viewer gets to have real sympathy for poor Angela, and it just makes the ending all the more horrific. The death scenes are interesting, because they all use a blend of POV shots from the killer,the pivotal moment of the kill is usually half or fully off-screen, and the viewer is presented with a wonderfully horrid aftermath shot.

It's easy to dismiss all the young, shirtless boys running about - or wearing skin tight short-shorts - as a sign of the times. But the killer's motivation, a gender identity issue somehow motivated by her father's homosexuality, was a bit much...especially when it crescendos in a ""shocking climax"" of underage, full frontal nudity.I've got to give this picture a couple points for its death sequences, but you'd expect that of a slasher film.

Robert Hiltzik's Sleepaway Camp was nothing more than homosexual content peppered with super evil bitches and bad acting. the scene in the beginning with the 2 teenagers on the speedboat was the dumbest scene i've ever seen in a horror film, as it was also hilarious. the character Aunt Martha was annoying as much as she was creepy. what kind of psychotic idiot would deliberately turn her own nephew into a girl??!!! if my aunt was like that, i'd secretly remove her from the family tree. felissa rose does a decent performance as ""Angela"", the main character/villain, Johnathan Tiersten does okay acting too, but the rest of the acting is atrocious. it's like the characters knew they were in a movie, but were trying to cover it up with cheap cliché dramatics. the ending was just unnecessary, and was really creepy. the music in the background was amazing, but it was ruined by the moans coming from Angela, which was the loudest sound in that scene. and now onto the rip off conflict. people say that the only way this film has a similarity to Psycho is meg's death in the shower, and the film rips off Friday the 13th in every way possible. that is incorrect. SC and F13 had very few similarities. the only thing they had in common was that it took place at a sleepaway camp, and that someone was going around murdering campers and counsellors. but here are ten things that SC stole from 'Psycho'.1. The killers in both films were dressed up as the opposite sex for a majority of the films.2. there are scenes in both films where a woman is brutally killed in a shower.3. Both killers had maniacal ""mothers"".4. Both films have an eery ""who-done-it"" theme.5. both films end with a shot of the killer, with their faces twisted into a creepy and intimidating ""smile"".6. SC and Psycho both take place over the course of 2-3 weeks, where as the events in Friday the 13th only occur in one day.7. It was the killer's mothers who drove them into insanity and murder.8. There are scenes in both films where a body is disposed of in a lake/swamp, and is eventually retrieved by the authorities.9. Both killers were orphans.and finally...10. Both killers could imitate the voice of a woman/girl.So basically, SC was rip off of Psycho more than it was a rip off of Friday the 13th. if you want to see this movie and you already saw PSYCHO, watch the film carefully, and you will find the similarities.My rating: 3/10",Sleepaway Camp
149,Pigalina,Creepy,6,11 June 2005,"This was part of a Cheesy Horror night and most of the time my friends and I were just amused by the funny 80s hair and clothes but the ending freaked us out, it is really creepy! And, they freeze it on a freaky image for nearly(if not all) the whole credits. Ick. Nobody expected the ending to be what it was. Most of the film is your standard summer camp horror movie - though the body count is rather high - kids getting it on, pranks etc.I recommend this film for its 80s value AND shock ending, though now everybody has told you the ending is shocking then you will probably spend the whole movie trying to figure out what it is.",Sleepaway Camp

151,Horror_Metal,A well directed slasher with an extremely shocking ending!,8,17 April 2014,"As a child, Angela Baker (Felissa Rose) witnessed her family get killed during a horrific boating accident. Eight years later, the still traumatized and slightly disturbed Angela and her cousin Ricky (Jonathan Tiersten) have been sent to Camp Arawak by their eccentric Aunt Martha (Desiree Gould). Angela and Ricky quickly notice that this summer camp is full of cruel bullies and pranksters who just wanna ruin everyone else's fun. Angela is constantly harassed for being so shy and introverted and Ricky is very protective of her. Angela opens up to a nice fellow camper named Paul (Christopher Collet) and develops a relationship with him. Meanwhile, a mysterious killer has been stalking and killing the numerous jerks at the camp responsible for tormenting poor Angela. As the bodies pile up, it becomes apparent that anyone with less than honorable intentions won't be leaving this camp alive!On paper, this film looks like it would just be another generic 80's slasher film set at a summer camp. It contains all the ingredients commonly found in this type of film complete with the camp setting, POV shots, obnoxious teens, atrocious acting/dialogue, and even the token slut character. But don't just shove this one aside as another standard Friday the 13th knockoff, as beneath all these clichés is a very unique and compelling story. One in which I was actually invested in from the start and was anxious to see how it played out. Another element that sets this film apart from the others is the character of Angela, competently acted by the lovely Felissa Rose. It's rare for a slasher film of this ilk to contain such a complex and interesting character. I really felt for this poor girl and wanted to see the ones who bullied her pay for what they had done. I should also mention the mind blowing ending, which is truly one of the most shocking I've ever seen. I won't give it away, but know that it's something you won't soon forget. This movie is truly something special and is a must see for all horror fans who appreciate a slasher that offers a little more than just meaningless slaughter.",Sleepaway Camp
152,Pinback-4,Not bad,6,14 February 2001,"I heard about this movie for years but never saw it until now.  the much talked about surprise ending wasn't surprising for me because I remember my doofus brother saw this film years ago and told my dad about it, and he just had to tell him how it ended while I was there in the room also.  Needless to say, the movies wasn't nearly as much fun as it should've been.  Like many previous comments have said, this is a FRIDAY THE 13TH-type horror suspense flick, but it also has elements of MEATBALLS and SUMMER CAMP NIGHTMARE (which is NOT a horror film).  It's about a girl about thirteen years old who goes to summer camp (it's called Camp Arawak in the film) with her cousin.  The girl is mute because of a long ago accident which put her in a state of long term shock.  Because she doesn't talk or participate in camp activities, the campers, both boys and girls, make fun of her.  Pretty soon her tormentors start turning up dead.  The movie quickly establishes two suspects, so it's not hard to guess who the killer is.  But that's not the point, of course; the point is the surprise ending.  If you watch carefully during the flashbacks scattered throughout the film, you might be able to guess it.",Sleepaway Camp

154,ReelBrew,Things aren't what they seem at a summer camp when one by one counselors end up dead!,7,22 November 2015,"Sleepaway Camp was released in the early heyday of 80's slasher films, sandwiched between Friday the 13th (1980) and A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984). Sleepaway Camp clung to the summer camp motif that began three years prior, as well as a particular camera angle that was first effectively used more than two decades earlier. Clinging even harder to the franchise that first began making teens afraid to attend any summer overnights, the movie opens years before its initial time setting, demonstrating a borrowed need to establish a rhyme and reason for the inevitable blood shedding.After a tragic incident while swimming in a lake (sound familiar yet?), Angela (Felissa Rose) attends a summer camp along side her protective cousin Ricky (Jonathan Tiersten), who despite his small frame is willing to stand up to anyone for his introverted cousin. After being introduced to the crusty ex-gym teacher looking camp owner Mel (Mike Kellin), whose attempts to cover up each murder as accidents, we are quickly thrown into the cruel world that befalls Angela. As the body count rises, so does the bullying, allowing for multiple suspects to open up within the realm of psychopaths; could it be Angela, the one being bullied, or Ricky, the aggressive protector, or possibly Paul (Christopher Collet), Angela's new admirer?Throughout the film we are continually guessing, as director Robert Hiltzik admiringly utilizes the first person camera established back in 1960 with the then controversial film Peeping Tom. After being re-established in John Carpenter's Halloween, and again two years later in Friday the 13th, its use is still as effective as ever, allowing us to bare witness to the slaughter head on, while keeping us guessing until that final shot.What kept the slasher genre running strong in theaters back in the day was its innovative, gory, and clever means of killing off hapless bystanders, attempting to give audiences its moneys worth. While Sleepaway Camp certainly doesn't bore the average gore seeker, it doesn't bring anything new to the table, with the most exciting kill feeling like a tribute to Lucio Fulci's The Beyond. Where the film truly excels is its perverse nature and promiscuity, wrapped around a well structured murder mystery. Even after the final shot is revealed and we're given a twist ending not seen since Norman Bates donned his Grandmother's wig, the suggestive perversion sits with us, seeping into our skin well past the credits.While Sleepaway Camp handles material that had been utilized before in a much sleeker and effective manner, all that doesn't stop it from becoming one of the defining slasher films of its time. It doesn't quiet sit up on the throne with the likes of Halloween, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, or Friday the 13th, but with it use of the first person camera and a twist ending sure to make you tweet everyone you know, Sleepaway Camp has taken its post amongst cult- horror, and it isn't going anywhere.",Sleepaway Camp
155,ArchieIsCool,sleepaway yawn,4,16 October 2011,"Well what can I say about this film, disappointing yes, acting poor yes, as a slasher movie I have seen more slashing when I chop veg!! Its all about the quiet girl who goes to camp for the summer and kills people who get her upset. The actress in the title role comes across as the perfect quiet girl who would not say boo to any goose, she spends most of the film just sitting and staring at potential victims. Her cousin who goes with her tries to protect her from being bullied but he need not worry as she deals with it by killing them ho ho. Her love interest if you can call him that takes a shine to our murderer and is kind to her and she slowly comes to like him, but unfortunately for him at the end of the film she takes his head off nice! The last bit of the film is the weirdest bit and a bit eerie, you see her standing naked holding the blade that killed the poor lad with her mouth open and then you see it she has a penis!!!!! The poor girl is a boy brought up as a girl by her weird aunt when he and his sister were in a boating accident which killed the sister and so the aunt decided I know you can be the daughter I never had and so the story unfolds.",Sleepaway Camp

If anyone likes seeing a penis is disturbed. You could clearly tell it was not her. It was obviously a mask of her on a man. It did not scare me. The beginning was awful. That is how you make character stupid. It was funny. This movie could easily be considered a comedy. The sequels are much worse than this though but this terrible. The killer is stupid and not scary.

Anyone expected a normal, run of the mill Friday the 13th clone will possibly be pleasantly surprised at some of what Sleepaway Camp brings to the table.

This leaves Angela with a fear of water. Her Aunt is quite possibly one of the battiest and most ridiculous characters I've ever seen, to the point of being irritating to watch - and yet she's only the second most irritating character in the movie.A few years later we see Angela and her cousin Ricky being waved off to summer camp by the loony Aunt. When they arrive Ricky is well known to many but Angela isn't and she becomes a bit of a loner.
Now the most irritating character comes into play, Judy. Judy is an old girlfriend of Ricky, a revolting spoilt brat who bullies Angela. She's truly awful, her head looks way too big for her body, she can't act and she gurns her way through the movie, her jaw juts out, she rolls her eyes and flicks her hair, apparently that passes for acting. You actually pray that the killer finishes her off.Pretty soon the little camp mates start dying. There are some pretty good kills, one in particular made my eyes water (you'll know when it happens) and when suspicion starts to fall on the wrong people we realise things aren't quite as they seem.The ending scene is legendary in the horror movie world, you're not expecting anything like it, I was stunned.

161,edeighton,Some Observations and a Theory as to who was the murder,5,4 October 2018,"Sleep Away Camp Review (spoilers)I had never seen this movie before this week. I have now seen it a few times. It's charm has really grown on me and I can now see why it is a cult classic. Many other reviewers have posted good and interesting reviews of the movie itself so I will not duplicate their efforts. Nor will I (as I frequently do) provide much background information about how this movie was made. There is already an insane amount of that type of info available on You Tube and the internet. Instead, I will point out some quick hit observations I have that have not already been covered ad naseum on the internet.* In the opening scene, the man on the kayak is Peter and Angela's father and the man on the shore is Ricky's dad who is married to Aunt Martha (Doc). These two brothers in law are gay lovers. The man on the shore leaves his wife Martha after the accident.* Head Counselor Ronnie (the weight lifting/ball-hugger short wearing guy) seems so nice to all of the counselors and campers, but he must have a mean-streak. Three times in the movie, angry authority figures threaten to ""tell Ronnie"" on the campers.*Robert Earl Jones plays the old black kitchen hand, Ben. This actor is the father of James Earl Jones famous as Darth Vader and the Lion King.*Yuck! Fly strips adorn the kitchen. They are literally everywhere in the kitchen shots.*The homo-eroticism is huge in this movie. 
(1) Clothing- I understand this was the early 80's but, Ronnie's dick and balls are barely being concealed in his short shorts and the mean older male campers wear crazy cut off shirts and shorts. I saw an interview with the actors in which they insisted that there was no wardrobe department and that the actors just brought their own clothes to camp.
(2) Boy Camper antics - a boy is tricked into jamming his face into another boys naked ass; a camp counselor calls a young boy ""lover boy"" and then 10 other boys throw him onto a bed and dog pile on top of him; the older boys are inexplicably standing on the roof of a cabin throwing water all over each other; the boys try and convince the girls to go skinny dipping but end up going by themselves for an all male naked swim
(3) Paul loves Angela - Out of all of the pretty girls in camp, Paul is attracted to Angela. Judy comments about this gay relationship at one point by derisively telling Paul ""I did not think she was your type"". At the first beach romantic scene Paul lays on top of Angela on the beach and fumbles awkwardly with her chest. He most have known at that point that she was a boy, yet he continues to pursue her throughout the film.
(4) The Theme Song- Frankie Vinci must have some eccentric tastes. His song ""Angela's Theme"" (""You're Just What I've Been Looking For"") seems to indicate that he knows that she is really a guy ( ""I know it's all a masquerade"" ""I know it's all a big charade"") and he approves (""You're just what I've been looking for"") because he does not like girls that don't have dicks (""You're the only girl I adore"")*Mozart lost his knife when Gene, the Cabin Counselor busts up some horseplay after Mozart gets shaving cream in the face. Gene takes the knife and places it in his personal shelf. That same knife is later used to cut open the window screen to kill Billy, the ""wicked dump"" taking camper, with a beehive; to stab Meg; and ultimately to decapitate Paul. How would Angela have gotten that knife? Is this evidence that maybe Rickey was also killing people or at least assisting Angela in doing so?* I believe that there were at least two killers. Angela and Ricky. In the scene in which Judy dies, it is clearly Ricky in a wig standing in her doorway. As stated above, Ricky would have had to either get the knife for Angela to use or use the knife himself in three of the killings. Mel, the camp owner, is sure that he saw Ricky outside the kitchen before Artie, the pedophile cook, dies and on the waterfront the night that Kenny dies in the canoe. In fact, the only murders that Ricky could not have committed are shooting Mel in the throat with an arrow and cutting Paul's head off. I challenge anyone to place Angela definitively at the scene of any of the earlier murders.",Sleepaway Camp

Gene takes Mozart's hunting knife and places it in Gene's clothing shelf. Yet, it is Mozart's hunting knife that is later used by the unidentified killer to cut open a bathroom window screen in order to kill Billy, the ""wicked dump"" taking camper, with a beehive; to stab Meg to death through the shower wall; and, finally to decapitate Paul. But, how could Angela have obtained Mozart's hunting knife? And, if Angela did not take Mozart's hunting knife from Gene's shelf in the boy's cabin, then who did? Ricky knew that the big hunting knife was in Gene's shelf and Ricky could have easily taken the hunting knife. Is this evidence that maybe Ricky was also killing some of these people or at least assisting Angela in doing so?* I believe that there were at least two killers. Angela and Ricky. In the scene in which Judy is killed by curling iron, it is clearly Ricky in a wig, not Angela, standing silhouetted in her doorway. As stated above, Ricky would have had to either get Mozart's hunting knife for Angela to use in three of the murders or use the knife himself for those killings. Mel, the elderly but horny camp owner, is sure that he saw Ricky outside the kitchen before Artie, the pedophile cook, dies and Mel claims that he saw Ricky on the waterfront the night that Kenny dies in the canoe. And logistically, it makes more sense for Rickey to have committed some of the murders. Could Angela really have ran all the way from the rec-room social out to the woods to kill all the little camper kids with an ax and still have time to run back to the waterfront to meet Paul? Ricky sure had time to kill both Judy and then kill the little sleeping bag camper kids with the ax before being confronted and beaten up by Mel. In fact, the only murders that Ricky could not have been physically present to commit are when Mel is shot in the throat with an arrow at the archery range and when Paul's head is cut off down by by the waterfront. Other than the deaths of Mel and Paul (which I concede were likely Angela), I challenge anyone to place Angela definitively at the scene of any of the other murders.",Sleepaway Camp

165,nvasapper,Unusual and different type of slasher film with an incredible twist,10,3 December 2008,"SLEEPAWAY CAMP stands out from the rest of the 80s slasher films in the unique approach it takes to its subject matter. It shares similarities with Friday THE 13th to a degree and more importantly and significantly, with Alfred Hitchcock's PSYCHO. Not just another mindless killer-on-the-loose movie, this film actually involves the viewer on many different emotional and psychological levels. There are themes and undercurrents here that serve to make this film a bit different than the usual cheap gorefest. Usually films of this type do not merit the accolade of ""intelligent."" But this film does. It touches on themes that society has traditionally been uncomfortable with- homosexual eroticism, rape, pedophilia, gender identity, and nonconformity.The movie is stolen by young newcomer actress Felissa Rose, who turns in a phenomenal performance as Angela- a painfully shy, quiet, and withdrawn adolescent girl who has a secret that she's been hiding since the death of her father and her sibling in a tragic boating accident eight years earlier. Without even saying anything, Miss Rose projects a screen presence that will indelibly imprint itself on the viewer. She is just so immensely appealing and involving. There is just something about her that makes you want to hug her and befriend her. I was very drawn to her character because I could definitely relate to her and her personality type.Raised by her offbeat and eccentric aunt after her father's death, Angela is sent to sleepaway camp for the summer in upstate New York with her cousin Ricky, who is very protective of her. From the moment she arrives in camp, it's obvious that she will not fit in. Because she's different and doesn't interact well with others, she quickly becomes the target of harassment and bullying from the other adolescents- most notably a camp counselor named Meg(KATHERINE KAMHI) and a teenage queen bitch named Judy(KAREN FIELDS). Angela doesn't utter her first word until about the halfway point of the film and until then, we don't know if she can speak. We don't know if she's a mute or not.Soon after her arrival, she's targeted for sexual assault by the head cook- a fat, ugly, repulsive pedophile who's thwarted in his attempt by the sudden, unexpected arrival of Ricky. This sets in motion the gruesome ""accidents"" and deaths that are to occur throughout the film. The cook, of course, is the first target of revenge- getting his comeuppance by being scalded on his face, body and arms by boiling water from a large cooking pot.All the people who hurt Angela and are mean to her wind up paying a stiff price for their behavior. *** SPOILER ALERT*** It won't take long for the viewer to figure out that Angela is the killer- although the film, like most films of its type, tries to throw the audience off by steering it toward an obvious suspect. But seasoned veterans of this genre know that's just a ruse. The twist is not that the shy, quiet girl is capable of such homicidal violence- because that's the way it usually turns out in these films. The twist comes in the revealing of who Angela is- and what she is. Although other reviewers have already spilled the beans on this, I will not do that here. Suffice it to say that, even if you know how the film ends from reading some of the other comments, you will nonetheless be shocked by the disturbing image you see when you watch it. I give this one a 10 out of 10.",Sleepaway Camp

The boys in this movie wear very feminine clothes. You see dozens of naked guys and even a homosexual love scene but not a single breast shot in the whole movie. In almost every other scene the guys seem to be touching on one and other. If I remember correctly the chef was a pedophile.Then the ending where we see Angela is really a boy, by a full frontal nudity shot.Juxtapose this with the horrible acting and low budget it might be kind of hard to swallow (pun intended HAHA) that the director would have mixed a commentary on sexual identity in low budget ultra B-movie schlock but seriously sit down and watch this, you be the judge.",Sleepaway Camp

Now horror is my favourite, genre. The reasons why I love horror are many, but when I tell this to people and get a negative reaction, the kind thats like 'you seem like an intelligent person. Why horror??'. I usually retort with an explanation of how, in my opinion, horror has the most diversity within any one genre. There's the high art, for example the paintings of Zdzisław Beksiński, or the writings of China Meivile. There's really popular stuff, that is really well crafted and deserves it's popularity, let's say the work of Stephen King, Wes Craven's films, old EC Comics etc. And then there's the pure pulp, the Friday the 13ths and the Sleepaway Camps. They are all great depending on what mood you may be in. (I also feel that it can be mixed with other genres much more successfully. Sci Fi-Aliens. Period Piece-The Others. Comedy-Shaun of the Dead. Kids-The Lost Boys or Goosebump books. etc etc). (wow rant). What I was saying when I was quite rudely interrupted, by myself. Was that I hadn't heard of 'Sleepaway Camp' until I saw the documentary (And that that was weird as Horror is my fave genre). They talked about the end, showed the end, and I was like 'What the CRAP!!' and I had to see it. So I went to ebay and bought it (for $1.20, but I live in Australia so it was $10 postage. Being here in Oz is probably also why I had never heard of it before, it might not have come out here, because I had NEVER seen it anywhere). I received it today and watched it, it would've been awesome if I didn't know how it ended, but it still had mass effect, I was watching it with my sister and her b/f, who hadn't seen the doco. They like me, went 'What the CRAP'.But, every positive comment on here praises the ending, so if you've read them you'll know that it is the main thing the film has going for it. The acting is ahem, bad. Truly awful, but in that bad horror film way, that you can watch it and chuckle, rather then be annoyed by it. The deaths were good, and I was surprised by the quality of the make up and prosthetics. The pacing was good, and even though the acting let it down, I also really believed the way the kids were being mean to each other.All round this'll be a movie I'll probably watch quite often, once a year or something thereabouts.

Of course, I had been into the Friday the 13th series that always seemed to play on TNT but everyone seems to forget all those other films. You may think of them as rip-offs to Friday the 13th and Halloween, but some of them are actually a lot better. Im not trying to say that this is better than any of those though, just know that there ARE good ones out there. This one is cheesy and stupid but it did take place at summer camp which is a great aspect in a slasher. If anything, I'd recommend the DVD commentary over the actual movie, because I really enjoyed hearing Felissa Rose and Robert Hiltzik talk about the making of this.",Sleepaway Camp

With the cheesy music, and those first kiss scenes, it comes off as corny, but once you get to the ending you are in for a shock. The first time I saw this I felt like I was going to throw up, it's very surprising and gross. But what makes the ending even sicker than what it already is, is the closing song.

175,Dr_Drew_Says,Dr. Drew says... 4 out of 10,4,10 October 2013,"Sleepaway Camp (1983): The Good, the Bad and the Twist Synopsis: A very shy and awkward young girl named Angela attends a summer camp with her cousin. Soon, the teasing ensues and campers start winding up dead. Gee, I wonder who it could be? The Good: Honestly, it's kind of hard to find a lot of good qualities in this movie. It's not scary. It's not very disturbing. It's not funny. Oh wait, this is supposed to be my list of ""good"" qualities! Okay, so how about.... ummm.... yeah, I got nothing. It's not that the film is horrible, it just doesn't do anything new or different. It's just kind of there. I guess some of the make-up effects on the dearly departed weren't too bad. The dead kid in the boat was even a little disturbing, but the problem is that all the killing is done with shadow effect (killing occurs off-screen), so it kind of ruins the gore and after all... this is supposed to be a slasher film. That was a pretty poor list of good things.The Bad: This will be easier. So we are at a youth camp of some sort where it looks like the kids are around 10-18 in age range. Pretty hard to tell what the camp is for, because they are always just hanging out and swimming... or playing baseball. Why they have the long, drawn out baseball scenes in this, I'll never know. Maybe to show the good guys from the bad? Either way... kids start dying. And not just dying, but being murdered in diabolical ways. Where are the angry parents? Where are all the police? And the camp is not only remaining open, murder after murder, but all the kids are still goofing around like nothing has happened? They even host a ""movie night"" after about the third kid is murdered. The only cop that shows up is a tad suspicious, but doesn't really do much. Musta been that super realistic mustache. The kids are all very unlikeable, foul-mouthed punks in redonkulous short shorts and various other 80's garb (especially the camp counselor that looks like Journey's Steve Perry on steroids). Angela, who is supposed to be the focus of this film, just stares... at everyone. Says nothing. It's like, ""just do something!"".. ""say something!"" Finally, after half the movie, she opens up her mouth and then her stilted dialogue becomes worse than the silence. Then you're like, ""just stop talking!"" All the kids are just whiny and fighting and it doesn't make much sense for the most part. Angela gets picked on and retaliates... that's about it. And there's other creepy, odd stuff like the pedophile cook and the teen camper asking out the 70 year old owner? Like, what is up with that? And he's excited about it? Get me outta here. I gave it 4 stars simply because it was good enough to view in it's entirety and it somehow made you care to see how it would end. There was enough there to want to find out.The Twist: Okay, so since I put the spoiler tag on my review, I am going to spill the beans on the twist. So if you haven't seen it, maybe it's a good time to stop reading. The twist is that Angela is a boy. They reveal this by showing her freaked-out, standing over a freshly killed dude and stark naked. Then the movie ends. Uh, okay. They honestly spent about 5 minutes total on Angela's back-story, which from what I can gather is that her cousin's parents took her in after hers died(?) and they really wanted a girl, not a boy. So apparently, they made her live like a girl or something. Traumatic... sure. Enough to make you a total weirdo and start slaughtering other campers? Hm. I didn't buy it. Maybe if they had spent more time showing what had happened to her, err.. him, we could have seen her/him endure the torture that made her/him go crazy. Instead, she/he just comes off as an oddball the whole movie and killing for what just appears to be mild to moderate hazing and then BOOM, we are just ""told"" that all this torturous mind-screwing is really the reason why. Like I said, I didn't buy it and it's probably why I didn't let a lot of the other weaker plot points go, because the main twist didn't work for me... so the movie fell apart. Can't wait to watch the sequels... lol.",Sleepaway Camp

For fans of the genre, it hit's on every point. Gore, check. Nudity, needs more, except for that one scene. *ahem* Teenagers at a summercamp, yeah! It even goes further than that and the actors, even the youngest ones seem to manage to bring a believability to their characters that pulls you in as a voyeur to the whole environment. It's the camera on the killers shoulder thing that often gets slasher fans buzzing. In this case it feels like more of a freeform journey that kind of takes you all around the place. Sure, mostly the camera is focused around Angela but you get enough time spying on the rest of the cast to get a real feel for them and the camp. No mean feat in a film of this genre.The ending is just such a classy twist. Don't read any spoilers or fan-pages before you see the movie, because they really will probably spoil it. Do pay attention at the end!

The plot description said the generic stuff about a killer loose at a summer camp. Having previously watched, and enjoyed, The Burning and Madman on previous episodes, I went in having a rough idea of what to expect. I was wrong. The first thing that shocked me was the staff members were clearly pedophiles which is terrifying in itself before all the violence starts. Even when you think you have figured out who the killer is, you get hit with a finish so stunning that you can't help but think about it for a long time.This movie deserves to be better known.",Sleepaway Camp

They just released this set on DVD in a cool box set that I just bought, but what sucks is that even the new DVDs are edited. Scenes were apparently shortened or just taken out. No real reason was given. One such scene is when one of campers is found dead under a kyack. In the original video pressing there is a long shot of his face with a lot of sea creaturs crawling all over it. In the DVD its shortened to maybe a second...it looks like a jump cut. There was also sound parts that were taken out for no apparent reason. It kinda sucks to say but if you find Sleepaway Camp on video anymore check that out.

179,gibbog,"I know it was supposed to be cheesy, but....",5,27 February 2005,"I recently purchased ""Sleepaway Camp"" on eBay, more as a curiosity than anything else as Parts 2 and 3 were broadcast on IFC a few months ago. I am not a huge fan of horror movies, more so a fan of cult movies. I felt I had to check this movie out after watching the other two parts. Compared to the rest of the series, SC 1 is a more ""serious"" horror movie. While I found SC 2&3 aimed more for a comedic angle, SC 1 had the feel of a classic 80's slasher film. While my expectations were not that high to begin with, I have to say I was a little disappointed in the film.To begin with, the copy of the DVD I purchased was released by a company called Legacy Entertainment Inc. I found the quality of the video very poor, in all aspects. The sound and picture were of a very low caliber. Maybe that was all they had to work with, and normally this can add to a movie's charm. But not here. It was more of an annoyance and a distraction. Secondly, after reading some of the other user comments on SC 1 I think it's fair to say I was expecting more in the way of gore. While there were some clever ideas, I thought they wern't explored as fully as they could have been. All in all for an 80's horror film it was halfway decent. At a fairly short 88 minutes it was an OK time filler, but really only worth checking out if you have an interest in cult movies. Rating: 5 out of 10",Sleepaway Camp

I haven't seen acting this horrible since the parents in ""Degrassi Jr./High""! Case in point: Angela's mother or whoever that lady is that ships her off to camp. Or when Judy tells off Angela - it's something out of a Russ Meyer film! Oddly enough, the acting had a kind of ""Reefer Madness"" quality to it.The casting is also terrible. The campers almost appear TOO YOUNG to recite the script. At one point, there is a camp counselor (in her 20s) who asks out the camp director (who is at least 50)!The script and plot line are totally disjointed. Angela's family was killed in the beginning, so what? Gay dads? WTF? So many pointless scenes. Whadda waste of film! It's a jigsaw puzzle that a blind person tried to piece together. And there are many, many missing pieces.The only good points that I can mention are: Angela's creepy stare - her acting though is another story, mood music - way too much at times, and the cheese factor.If you're totally bored and don't mind sittin' through an 80s, cheese, camp-slasher, be my guest.

183,chicothekid,Decent movie with a killer ending!,4,23 January 2001,"Every once in awhile, somebody gets a really great idea for a movie and then just squanders it like a couple of bucks in a casino.  This is pretty low budget material, and was probably just a project that the camp worked on over the summer.  Kevin Hiltzik could have made something extra special here but never quite got it right.  Sleepaway Camp is the story of a girl at a Summer Camp.  Angela (Felissa Rose) is really shy and doesn't participate in any of the games and doesn't even talk to anyone except one or two people. The other problem is that people are getting murdered at the camp. Naturally when people are getting murdered, the camp continues as normal, which is good because that allows the killing spree to continue unhindered as well. One of the camp leaders knows who is responsible for the killing and is going to put a stop to it, but how many people are going to die before it ends?All things considered, this really isn't that bad of a movie.  Most of the actors involved were the kids at the summer camp and they are all pretty good.  The film quality is terrible though, and if there is one person involved in this movie that is due for a horribly painful death, it's whoever was in charge of the lighting.  This movie might have the worst lighting ever put to film; just about everyone has the lights shining right in their faces during every scene.  It's as distracting as it is painful to watch and it's too bad because it really wrecked an otherwise decent movie. The basic idea behind the movie is a good one, but the writing that delivers the idea is pretty poor.  There is quite a bit of substandard material to sit through, but if you can make it, the ending is one of the best I've seen.  You have to give Hiltzik credit for this one because the ending is up there with the ""Sixth Sense"" as far as blowing you away.  If you are in the mood to try something a little out of the ordinary, check this one out if you can find it.",Sleepaway Camp
184,forecastfortoday,A Memorable Standout for Camp Slasher Movies,10,30 January 2010,"Okay, I'm not sure how to sum this one up. I would like to call this movie a forest slasher such as The Prey (1984), Don't Go in the Woods (1980), Just Before Dawn (1980), or The Forest (1982) but since this movie barely even takes place in the forest, I would consider it more in the Friday the 13th (1980) or The Burning (1981) field. This movie is pretty much Friday the 13th with more creative death scenes, more plot holes, younger characters, less of a budget, and a shocking twist ending.The movie starts out with a man and his two children, Peter and Angela. The family is playing around in a lake but end up in a boating accident caused by some young water skiers. The accident kills the father and Peter. Eight years later, Angela (the survivor of the boating accident) has moved in with her aunt Martha and her cousin Ricky. Angela and Ricky are going to a summer camp for a few weeks but once they get there, Angela is regularly tormented by the mean counselors and kids at the camp. The kids and counselors that pick on Angela, specifically rude ass counselor named Meg and a bitchy girl named Judy, start getting killed off. This unfolds into a twisted climax fueled by creepy, homosexual subtext and driven by a deep, dark, secret.This movie is pretty messed up when compared to other slashers, but this isn't necessarily in a bad way. The characters are mainly the kids at camp which makes it more disturbing to watch when thinking of the standard body count this film includes. The deaths are actually very unique, such as a man (presumably) dying after being scalded with a vat a boiling water, a young girl being impaled on curling tongs (nobody can really explain how the curling iron kills her...), a young man is locked in a bathroom stall with a hornets' nest, etc. To be completely honest, I found myself rooting for the killer because the victims were extremely mean. I'm not saying it's right for somebody to kill somebody else because they're bullies, but I was happy when some of them died. The ending isn't really an ending to be fair. It's more like an enormous plot twist that ends right in the middle of the climax. That doesn't make the abrupt ending less amazing, in fact that just makes it more interesting because it makes you ask yourself what's next. All in all, the movie is quite a nice little horror opus. It gives gritty atmosphere, good suspense and shock, and a big curve ball of an ending.",Sleepaway Camp
185,dburton2,this movie brings the complete package,8,10 February 2019,"Kudos to the director for keeping things disturbing from start to finish (especially the finish) with inventive and imaginative plot twists and methods of killing -- a cut above (pun intended) most 80s slasher movies. Also, the low budget, and kids who looked like real kids rather than child actors as the campers, and stupid pranks and bullying by the campers, makes for a realistic-seeming summer camp atmosphere, which adds to the impact as the body count starts to mount.",Sleepaway Camp

Most movies like Friday the 13th and Halloween the killer a blank-faced cipher. Here, not so much. This film is low-budget and there are parts that can be laughed at but something chokes off the laughter.The girl who plays the main character has the most haunting stare I've seen in a horror movie. And there is an underlying theme of sexual repression, bullying, and homosexuality. The victims are not the innocents being dispatched that you normally see in a horror film. Most are taunting karma.And that ending is a shocker. I saw this movie in my 20s and was quite disturbed. That's recommendation enough, I think.",Sleepaway Camp

Well, i've watched it and i'm not that convinced. But i had fun.First, let me put your attention on the positive things : the movie wasn't boring to watch and the ending was cool and (even if you had read about it) surprising, even when the ending was over way to soon (you know what i mean when you see it). The background on Angela was also interesting (surely the idea, the execution had to deal with bad acting - i will deal with this later on). And we all damn know that we don't have to expect an Oscar-worthy movie when you're going to see a slasher movie.But now, oh yes, the negative side : the acting was for the most part (99,5%) bad, bad in a way you even not see anymore these days. I mean, unconvincing and wooden to perfection!!! Fortunately, this makes you eager to see a lot of people getting butchered in horrible ways. But there was very little slasher in this slasher movie. There was totally no suspense or anything like that, you just sit down and watch it and accept it. No scary parts, no gruesome parts, no moving parts, nothing!!! Technically, it wasn't that great either, but luckily this kind of movie doesn't need much of technical quality. And of course, sometimes the movie was plain silly and unlogical and unconvincing, but hey, that's a merit that lot of slasher movies have.What maybe deserves a special note, is that of course al these children here are at maximum 15-16 years old, what gives it a special feel sometimes. I don't know why it does, but at least it's better then a ""summer camp slasher movie where all people are 21 years or older"", like 'Friday the 13th'. But that movie was better in all the other departments.If you add the positive and negative things, you might say that this movie isn't worth your time. And i have rated it 2/10. But even then i say : go rent it, because it occupies your time better then other movies. And the ending is still special. But don't expect much!",Sleepaway Camp

I saw this with my brother and we were laughing throughout but nothing prepared us for that final scene. We were doubled over in laughter. I've only seen it once more in its entirety many years later, but the effect is not the same. It is not a very good film and feels like it didn't know what it wanted to be. It's not scary. The kills are predictable and lack any imagination. The acting is hopeless poor,especially by the ""actress"" who plays the mother of Angela. She feels like she is straight out of a John Waters film. I found it more comical than scary, except for the creepy paedophile staff member eyeballing the kids. It adds a layer of sleaziness than makes a cheap movie even cheaper. It doesn't even fall into that so-bad-it's-good category. Films like that are rewatchable but Sleepaway Camp just lacks that fun. Even for a horror film it is uncomfortably mean spirited and you have not the slightest sympathy for anyone who gets killed. I gave it a generous four stars just for the final five minutes.

We respect ""Psycho,"" but we can never quite believe it was really THAT scary.  ""Halloween"" doesn't make you jump; rather it makes you smile as the slow-moving killer attacks shirtless girls.  However, ""Sleepaway Camp"" is a scary movie.  In fact, it's probably the scariest movie I've ever seen--just not for the reasons that it intended to be scary.Sure, on paper, it looks to be just your run-of-the-mill cheap slasher flick, but, in actuality, it is so much more.  It is the most unsettling hour and a half ever put on film.  Everything about ""Sleepaway Camp"" makes one uncomfortable.If one ignores the much talked about secret ending, there is still plenty in the film to act as nightmare fuel.  There's the creepy aunt who's a community theater version of Joan Crawford with man-hands.  There's the disturbing relationship between the much-older camp owner and one of the teenage counselors.  There's an unexplained element of gay parents. There's a weird moment of two young children touching each other in bed.  There's a pedophile cook, his Uncle Remus-like assistance and the world's largest pot of hot water.  There's an untimely death from a curling iron.  There's male counselors who wear shirts that only cover half their chest along with shorts that cover even less.   All of these things, and more, combine to form a film experience that wears you down.  Watching this film is a tiring, arduous process.Film historians claim that showing a toilet flush in ""Psycho"" unsettled the audience--making the murders in that film even more shocking.  Whether intentional or not, ""Sleepaway Camp"" does the same thing.  In fact, it surpasses ""Psycho"" in its disconcerting ways.  Forget toilets flushing. ""Sleepaway Camp"" eats away at the viewer with creepy image after creepy image.   I dare anyone to attempt to find a film with more creepy elements in it.The supposed ""horror"" of the film won't get to you, but everything else about it will leave you highly unsettled.

This is pain at its worst.Let us set aside, for the moment, the really bad acting (complete with New Yawk accents) and focus more on the lack of believability of many scenes.*** NOTICE OF SPOILERS AHEAD ***The killer (who during the film we know is one of the campers - so obviously a kid) could not have pulled the head chef off the stool since he weighed close to 300 pounds and was standing squarely on the stool when the killer was pulling on it.If Angela (later revealed as the killer) is so deathly afraid of the water (we learn this when Meg throws her in), how did she get in the water and kill the kid under the canoe?When the beehive is thrown into the bathroom stall, the kid cannot get the door open because of the broom handle.  I have two problems with this scene. First, we only see his legs under the bathroom stall while he tries to open the door.  Am I the only one who thought ""why not just crawl under the door since it at least a foot and a half off the ground??"".  Second, when he first goes in the stall, it is very obvious the door in extremely flimsy and could have easily been broken down (broom handle or not) by anyone in an agitated state.You cannot EVER make me believe that a cute young girl like Meg would EVER want to go out with Mel, the camp's owner, who wears black socks with shorts, or horrid plaid polyester pants with white shoes.  I would sooner believe this film would be nominated for a ""Best Picture"" Academy Award before I believe that.Now, on to the really really bad acting.  This becomes apparent very early on in the film when Aunt Martha is sending Ricky and Angela off to camp and gets even worse as the film progresses.  The worst of them all has to be Karen Fields as Judy.  She is bad bad real bad.  She is closely followed up by all the boys in the baseball, skinny dipping, and water balloon fight scenes.The only small ray of acting sunshine in this downpour is Christopher Collet who played Paul.

I thought that maybe I saw it many moons ago and that I may not have realized it and my wife assured me that it was a good movie.  A couple of weeks later low and behold as I am unwrapping birthday presents what do I find?  The Sleepaway Camp box set! I couldn't wait to get home to see them.On a quiet Sunday afternoon my wife and I sit down to have a Sleepaway Camp marathon.  The first movie on tap, Sleepaway Camp I.  I was very impressed by this movie considering it is a low-budget film.  The movie starts with two men out on a lake with their kids and a boat accident leads a series chain of events.    The girl that was present at the accident goes to camp years later to get revenge on anyone who gets in her way.  I found all of the deaths to be very original and very well displayed considering the limited budget.  The ending was probably the most frightening image in film history.  You must see this film.

Unlike its paramours its much more complex and deep with different twists and turns.If you don't know the ending (and please do not go looking for it. It'll spoil the ride) Prior to seeing this movie it will keep you guessing right up to the last scene and before your really sure what happened its over.It took me awhile to really appreciate this film and it isn't till now after seeing the sequels (which are very good) that I really like this movie.Definitely recommend seeing this.",Sleepaway Camp

The plot is very simple and predictable most of the time, but it has its twist and the ending sequence, which is really good.

I just watched it again for the first time in 13 years and it was as good as I remembered it. The reason I like this movie is because: 1-It has scenes that are unprecedented and completely original 2-There are scenes that will never leave your mind 3-Ricky's swearing is just flat out hilarious 4-I like old movies filmed with old camera's better than all the modern equipment we have now. For some reason these old movies have a different feel to them. I am not sure how to describe it.The scene where Angela gets drilled with a water balloon and Ricky drops about every word on the guys that threw it is hilarious. The movie drops language left and right. I normally would stay away from a movie that drops so much language but for some reason it is funny.

The serial killer going crazy at a summer camp full of kids isn't exactly the most original plot.But Sleepaway Camp is very different, memorable, and by far one of the best of its kind. For starters, the acting is better than the usual fare seen in these kind of movies. A few of the performances border on great.And as with all horror movies, the bodies rack up and in this case, they're done in original ways. One in particular (the curling iron one, as brought up by many) has to be one of the most disturbing deaths ever put on film. And it's not even gory or anything like that. It's the shadows and what we don't see that makes for an incredibly memorable scene.But what, above all, makes Sleepaway Camp very memorable? It's the ending, one that will leave almost every viewer reeling. Obviously, I don't want to give it away. The power of it can only be seen when watching it. It sure isn't the usual twist. This one packs a huge punch and gives it a very unique and interesting theme. And for that alone, Sleepaway Camp is worth seeing.",Sleepaway Camp

207,msblackeyes68,Stupidest movie ever,1,15 December 2016,"I watched this because I read reviews raving about the twist at the end.... I was expecting a sixth sense kind of ending. So I put up with the horrible acting, ridiculous dialogue, predictable story line, and the oddest killing tools that I've ever seen. The first attempt to kill someone should have been my first clue. Pulling a chair out from someone (yes a chair not a ladder) which by the way the guy sees it coming, they fall and pour boiling water on top of them. Now I won't even get into how most people would have jumped down because it's ridiculous that anyone would grab a huge pot of boiling water to stop them self from falling, but he was alive and yelling and crying and no one thought to ask ""hey who did this?"" I'm assuming as they kept saying how much pain he was in that that was there way of explaining why he couldn't tell them anything. Now I've sat thru movies thinking the victim was pretty stupid to be caught like they were, but sitting on the toilet in a public bathroom when the killer uses a broom handle to keep the door from opening and then releases bees and your to stupid to crawl under the stall? I was so frustrated that I rooted for the bees. Then there was the kill with a curling iron? Where exactly does one put that to kill someone(her clothes were still on in case your mind went there). Then half way thru the movie they realize there is a killer and NO ONE goes home? Instead they continue on as if nothing is wrong. Then the writers who think we weren't paying attention have someone call the camp and they are told yes their is a killer?!?! Huh? Then we are finally at the end and I'm thinking OK this is it, this is where I get rewarded for not shutting the stupid movie off and the killer is revealed AND ITS...... well I won't go into that much detail. All I can say is that yes when I saw who it was and they flashed on why I went wow didn't see that coming.... However it wasn't worth getting there. My advice watch the first 15 min.

It is NOT some cheap, mindless slasher film for its own sake. It IS cheap, with a budget of $350,000 in 1983. However, the key points in the film do an excellent job of using what they have. The more disturbing parts are not graphic, but imply the very uncomfortable horror in their ideas. The actors that really matter do an excellent job. Felissa Rose as Angela does an outstanding job without hardly uttering a word.This is a disturbing film, and that is a compliment to its credit. It is DEFINITELY worth the watch, if you are an enthusiast of the horror genre. This movie certainly understands the special storytelling advantages of this genre and uses them.

I didn't expect this when I sat down to watch it. I had a similar experience from watching the Exorcist.The teenagers in this behave like real teenagers. Everything is great in this movie.

There's more going on here than standard slasher fare. For example, gender roles are flipped in many ways that put it far ahead of its time. Real life horrors like molestation and bullying are addressed (and dealt with in memorable fashion). And the ending will keep people talking for more years to come after this. Felissa is iconic.

Sleepaway camp has awesome gore scenes. Below average acting. (the gore scenes make up for the mediocre acting) Fellisa Rose does an outstanding Job on this movie. I hear there is going to be another coming out in 2007. The only problem I had with this movie was the gay sex scenes. Gross! But the ending is on my list of best twist endings ever. While Fellisa is standing at the end after stroking Paul's hair from his decapitated body we can all see that she is a... (dramatic moment...) a boy!

But if you must read, don't worry I won't give anything away.
This movie was really shocking, because I had no idea what was to come at the end.  And that's the best way to see this film, is to not know anything about it. Just watch the film for what it's worth, and don't expect it to be a masterpiece, and I almost can guarantee that you'll have a fun movie experience.The movie consists of cheezy 80s dialogue, funky 80s clothing style, and very very cheezy love story, all rolled into one.  There isn't really any gore or nudity at all in this film.... well not really.What most people discuss is the ""blow your mind ending"", I was actually really shocked, surprised, and even creeped out because of the the way the film ended.  The ending definitely will spook you if you don't see many horror films.  But if I say anymore, it would give too much away already. I'll just say that I've seen many horror flicks in my time, but it's been a long time since I've been so entertained and best of all shocked by a wacked ending.I gave this film a 10/10 for great entertainment.  This film didn't try to be a masterpiece, but I can see how this film is known as one of the greatest slashers ever. I was actually really surprised to have enjoyed a film that looked like cheezy crap. Felissa Rose performed very well as the quiet Angela.  She definitely was the key to making this film work as great as it did.A must see for anyone who's looking for a eerie, surprising, fun, movie.

With a disturbingly young cast and bizarre queer subtexts this is a must for anyone into camp/cult films. Not to mention a great ending and some creative death scenes. Judy as the main bad girl truly makes this film for me,and her demise is tragic, a fate so terrible that the filmmakers don't have the guts to show the aftermath. Yes, a curling iron to the crotch is never a pleasant experience R.I.P Judy, R.I.P. The plot really is secondary, a tragic boating accident leaves a newly orphaned Angela, who looks a lot like Sarah Silverman, with her aunt Martha and cousin Ricky, and off to camp the kids go, where bad things start to happen. This is from a time when horror was an odd creature, the film is clearly made for 12 year olds, much in the way that Deadly Friend was too, but contains fairly graphic, albeit silly, death scenes and strings of profanity designed to make the young ones giggle.

I have always KNOWN about Sleepaway Camp, and remember the old days of video rental when I would be wandering the horror section and see it every time, and read the back and then pass it up. I'm glad I did because as an older, wiser horror fan I think I appreciated this more now than I would have as a kid. The story is basic: A young, traumatized orphan girl goes to a summer camp with her cousin, where she is bullied mercilessly and surrounded by some of the worst councilors any camp could not hope for. Meanwhile bodies slowly start piling up. But not until the last 3rd of the movie. A couple ""scary"" things happen, but other than one character, no one dies until the end. But the end is what makes this movie. No spoilers here, but if you want a cheaply made horror film set at camp with bad acting and ridiculous writing, but still manages to entertain and keep you guessing till the end, you won't be disappointed. If you like your slashers to have a high level of gore, and murders happening every 6 minutes, you may be disappointed. I recommend, and will be watching the sequels.Emetophobia warning (spoiler): When the counselor who left the boys in the woods comes back to see them all dead in their sleeping bags, he v*s.

226,nailhead,A ghastly ghoulish go go delight!,10,10 April 2000,"It had been years since I saw this movie, but I remembered the key elements. Young girl is harassed at camp, her bullies start dying off, unforgettable ending. I just never realized how big of a classic this really is. For those of you who don't know, the film starts off with a man on a boat in the middle of a lake with his two children. The boat tips over, another boat comes racing towards them and kills all but one.
Flash forward 8 years later, the sole survivor now lives at her aunts house, where she sends the girl, Angela, and her cousin, Ricky, to summer camp. At camp, Angela is brutally teased and taunted by her fellow campers. Her cousin Ricky continuously comes to her defense, but the bullies are all being killed off by a mysterious unknown attacker. All of this leads up to an ending that I believe to be one of the most shocking in cinema history.
Felissa Rose gave an excellent performance as Angela, who makes you sympathize heavily for her, due to her soft mannered and soft spoken personality. She is very much the kid we all were, and some of you might still be. A vulnerable target for those with a superiority complex, very much the outcast.Writer/Director Robert Hiltzik fills the film to the brim with psychological undertones, masterfully creating a genuine thriller out of this low grade, slasher extraordinare. But you don't care about that, do ya'. You want gore! And while it's not an overtly gory film, there are enough offerings of blood here and there to keep you gorehounds satisfied. Not to mention some nifty death scenes. And the ending, my friends, is what makes Sleepaway Camp worth the watch. That's not to say SC isn't a good film, in my opinion it's great, but for those of you who have no clue as to how it ends... You will not be disappointed.

No joke, I wonder if this was just the norm back in 1983....and it frightens me. More than the rest of the movie....Kids end up being A-Holes...then dead.

Also, I give a little credit for a twist at the end (the only reason my rating went to the middle of the scale), but the obviousness of who the killer is throughout is beyond stunning. I kept asking myself if maybe they were doing that on purpose to turn it upside down...but then I'm sure they would have run into some serious consistency flaws... However, the gimmicks and unoriginal plot line of this movie show that those involved making it were not all that astute about...flaws... If you want to watch an average depiction of a plot diagram that is so infantile, one could predict the thoughts of the creators as if they were guided by blind instinct, then go on, laugh at them while watching this movie.

If you want to see this film, I hope you don't scare or puke easy, because this movie makes ""Friday the 13th"" look tame! I give it a 9!",Sleepaway Camp

Separate and think about what themes were presented in the movie (you could even write a 'response' paragraph).  Regroup and discuss.Or you could just watch the movie and go to bed.",Sleepaway Camp

But that's all I'm gonna say. I don't want to give anything away. This movie definitely deserves a 10 because it is a great horror film and it still has many fans. (After 23 years!!!)

He dropped some one-liners that made me laugh cause it was so lame. It reminded me of the 50's for some reason.... But somehow it suited the movie, which didn't make me hate it. The story is pretty predictable. You have an idea what is really happening in the movie but the ending throws it all out the window cause you never expected that to happen... I think it was the ending that made it all worth watching and made me appreciate it. The ending made me zone out and gave me the chills. The reality of the story is twisted which is why I watched again after I first saw it. Overall, I highly recommend this cult-classic. It's truly one of a kind.",Sleepaway Camp

The characters spend the entire movie over-acting, but in a way that makes you laugh (compared to movies where you just sit there in shock at how bad the acting is). The film was original in many ways: Instead of 20-something camp counselors getting killed, the victims were actually the teenage campers. Instead of some psychotic masked killer with a chainsaw, the killer was one of the main characters (something not often seen during this time). And more so than anything, this movie doesn't contain excessive nudity or gore! Which, for the heterosexual male, is probably a drawback. But gay males and straight females will probably enjoy the 500+ unintentionally homo-erotic scenes in this movie.In short, I realize I've done nothing to actually explain the plot of this movie. But you can read the plot on your own! Just to sum it up, it's a great film, completely hilarious due to being completely drenched in the 1980's, and is the best slasher film I've ever seen due to it's rampant originally, campiness, and (rather shallow) depth!",Sleepaway Camp

After I got home I popped in the first one and sat back for some 1980's B style horror. What I got was a lot of slack for even watching it, not to mention the constant ribbing I received when my friends found out I actually owned it. The movie was slow, filled with horrid acting, and the bullies acted really gay, and by gay I mean homosexual; always talking about being undressed with their friends.....that's too much to handle while watching a bad movie. It took 4 sittings to finish watching this nightmare. The owner was occupied with the murderer being a wimpy, whiney little boy, the cook trying to get his rocks off with the little girl, and the cheesy as hell ""scary"" score......Thank God the other two movies are o.k.Anyone that likes this movie should be tied to a chair and given a few hundred shock treatments and get their head examined.

I lOVE THIS MOVIE!.Sure it's not exactly academy material or something that could be even remotely compaired to Kurosawa or Kubrick,but there is something about this Movie that makes it stick out(you can take that as a pun for those of you who have seen it).Sure I know you've all heard it before and your gonna hear it again...The Shocking and Disturbing Ending.Watching a movie like this one has a bit of an expectation,*POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD* You think your just gonna get another silly 80's slasher movie with weak characters, weak script, and an even weaker resolution.But oh how you are proven wrong when you watch Sleepaway Camp.Ok,I'll admit there is a great deal of cheesiness and the acting is...well a bit weak at times (sometimes totally histerical!)but this movie despite slight faults that are most common in B-horror movies,leaves the viewer almost catatonic with confusion,shock,and the very common ""WHAT THE F*CK?!"" reaction.The movie also shows an interesting creativity in the field of Horror Film Deaths.Most of which involve almost no blood or gore,but still come off quite disturbing with excellent make-up effects.I think that almost any viewing of this movie after the initial is the best.You have all the pieces of a sick and twisted puzzle put together and your able to enjoy the characters and the highly comic aspects of the movie much more.Plus if you are like me you get an almost nervous feeling in your gut as the movie approaches it's final minutes that ends in a truly horrifying freeze frame that p***es me off because it always scares the crap out of me along with a creepy song that accompanies it.The director obviously used his head towards trying to be different.He took the small handfull of final minutes that a director can use to either make or break his film and he grabbed them by the balls (no pun intended) and molded them into something crazy and effective.It's endings like this that would have a beautiful crowd reaction in theatres of its original release,blank faces,puzzled faces,petrified faces.It changes the whole perspective of the movie and really ""Makes It"".B-horror buffs are probubly the biggest followers of this movie for it is not for all tastes.But if you are looking for a good old slasher film with...a little something extra (I need to stop with these damn inuendows (( i think thats how you spell it))Than look no further than SLEEPAWAY CAMP,unless your afraid to test your manhood (i have problems.)By the way, Mozart is the coolest character in the whole world.",Sleepaway Camp

I have to say, as a whole, the film itself is pretty bad. The acting is terrible, the dialogue is cringeworthy and sounds like it was written by a 6-year-old, and the killings are underwhelming and boring. Plus it's full of 'filler' scenes as another reviewer pointed out, showing the campers playing sports and messing about in their cabins, etc. I know it's a film about a teenage summer camp and they certainly got the hormone-fuelled mise-en-scene spot on, but there just wasn't really enough tension or suspense which are key ingredients for a good horror.But the ending. Wow. I knew there was something extremely weird about Angela and I did kinda guess all along that she was the killer, but I was not expecting that other twist.

Angela and Ricky then go to camp and it is Angela's first time going but Rickey has been there before. Angela doesn't get along with the other campers and is very quiet.

It is too bad that either most people have never heard of it, or that those that have seem to dislike the movie. It is NOT a Friday the 13th rip-off. It is far superior to that film. I like Friday the 13th, don't misunderstand me, but SC is more than your typical slasher film. It is full of emotion, drama, mystery and a genuinely scary atmosphere. The murder scenes are original and gruesome. The acting is WAY above average by ALL those involved. Felissa Rose especially gives a phenomenal performance as the shy messed up teenager Angela. You will never forget her!. But all in all the whole cast delivers the goods and then some. The movie really pacts a punch. The shocking climax has been well documented, but every scene in this movie is a treasure to behold. I strongly recommend it to all open minded people out there. The music is great as well. Both the score by Edward Bilous and the three songs by Frankie Vinci are perfect for it! Sleepaway Camp gets a well deserved 10 from me.

I'll try to make it short. Sleepaway camp is a classic for its ending, otherwise it would be a terrible knock-off of Friday the 13th. It has an original script with elements of surprise that makes this low budget film very unique. I got to admit; at first, I wasn't expecting much. People were saying lots of things about the finale and how DISTURBING it is and I was just thinking to myself: Yes people, like I've never heard that song before... I'm not scared of horror films, period. The ratio of horror films I watch and horror films that scare me basically tells me that I'm not scared easily. I grew up with this stuff. Horror, gore and creepy things are what I like and I feel comfortable in it. I can count on ONE hand all the films that legitimately scared me, and this one is now on the list. It literally made me think twice about my desperate search for a good scare and why I should just stop (I won't though..) I'm not kidding people, the finale is something. I was watching the movie and thought to myself: There's NO WAY this cheesy film can have such a good ending, just how ?? Well I got my answer pretty quickly and I will NEVER forget this movie EVER...

Main character is Angela, a naive, quiet and very mysterious girl, constantly the victim of disparaging comments from other girls. Most of the times saved by her cousin Ricky, a brave boy always fighting with bullies. All is good until dead bodies star to show up and the modus operandi is very diverse. Teenagers, adults, no one escapes.. Who is the mysterious killer?! Watch to the very end! (One of the best endings in film history, btw! Bold statement, ah?

261,michaelobrienfilm,"Blood, boats, and short shorts.",6,15 February 2015,"'Sleepaway Camp' is horror insanity that could've only been made in the 80s. The summer camp is overrun with pedophile staff, unusually aggressive kids (played by actors ranging from 12 years old to 35 years old, it seems), and multiple gruesome deaths that go largely unnoticed.The plot is copied straight from the slasher films of the era, with slews of victims being brutally murdered by a faceless killer (from their POV) for no good reason. Wooden acting, goofy death scenes, horny teenagers, bad special effects, hilarious costumes (see the unbelievably short shorts worn by the oddly muscular camp counselor) - all these things add to the overall charm of 'Sleepaway Camp'. Don't put on this film and expect to be scared, but be prepared to be amused and captivated by it's weirdness.I'd recommend this film to anyone with an interest in older horror films, particularly the slasher genre. Or to anyone who loves watching a so-bad-it's-good movie with their buddies and some beers. 'Sleepaway Camp' is worth a watch just for the insane ending, which, if you haven't read up on this movie, you won't expect - but it will stay with you.",Sleepaway Camp
262,JavaJunkette,Ahead of its time,9,7 December 2005,"I think this movie is ahead of its time given what we see of homosexuality, and transsexuality today. Sure, it's a horror movie, but it's also a commentary on gender roles in society: what makes a person feminine or masculine. If I had to choose, I'd say Judy is the extreme view of the female with her extravagant sexuality, and Ricky is the extreme view of the male with his exaggerated toughness. Angela is the median being torn between both extremes. Through Angela, the movie also brings up the question of what makes us male or female: our physical bodies or someone else's perception of us.This may be a little deep for a little horror movie, but it's interesting to think about while watching the movie again nonetheless.",Sleepaway Camp

The end of the movie also contains a shocking twist, which I really enjoyed. Unlike most teen horror movies, there isn't a lot of nudity; however, there is quite a bit of profanity.

Sleepaway Camp is full of classic horror stereotypes. They spent the budget (thankfully) on effects, not actors. I couldn't believe the size of the cast for what was surly a small budget movie. The eighties wardrobe was hilarious (Men in short shorts and cut off Tee's), that alone was worth watching the movie for. The actor who plays Ricky could have went on to have a career, cause his natural acting ability grounded the movie. Without him being realistic there'd be no foundation, no solid core of normality to keep us watching. My viewing him as a good actor could be based on the fact that everyone else seemed like Over-dramatic high school performers. Sorta awkward, waiting for there cue types. But as far a low budget, low quality horror films go this is watchable with an open mind and no high hopes. Great for group viewing, creates great laughs.",Sleepaway Camp
265,spknezek,Warning Spoilers: Misidentified,6,31 December 2002,"Many people have made the connection to the Friday the 13th series with Sleepaway Camp for obvious reasons.  They both came out within a few years of each other and all the action takes place at a summer camp.  However, the primary theme in the Friday the 13th series is vengeance.  Vengeance of a mother for the neglect and drowning of her son and then vengeance by the son for the murder of his mother.  Of course vengeance is also key to all the murders in Sleepaway Camp but for entirely different motivations.  The murders of Sleepaway Camp come from sexual repression, being picked on, and sexual molestation.  All these derive from feelings of shame and embarassment which is different than the motivations of Friday the 13th. A better comparison for Sleepaway Camp would be Psycho.  First let me say that in no one are the two comparable, Psycho is a masterpiece of story, directing, acting, and camera work, Sleepaway Camp is none of these.  But they share similar thematic characteristics.  Norman Bates suffers an Oedipal complex but when his mother takes a new lover he kills her and suffers tremendously.  He is overwhelmed by guilt and shame and brings her back to life in his mind.  But whenever he sees an attractive woman he feels guilty and shameful and murders them because his mother is jealous for his affection.  Sleepaway Camp is a more bizarre twist on these themes. Angela's (who turns out to be a boy) father and sister are both killed in a boating accident.  But unlike Jason, Angela does not wreck havoc on the camp for those deaths.  Instead Angela is adopted by her demented Aunt and forced to become a girl because the Aunt already has a son, Ricky.  There are two scenes in which I'm guessing a young Ricky and Angela witness two men, presumably Ricky's father and his lover having sex.  These scene is followed by a scene in which suggests a sort of sexual molestation between young Ricky and young Angela.  These two pivotal events greatly affect Angela and cause a sexual crisis within him/her.  What begins the rampage at Camp Arawak is another sexual molestation performed by the cook on Angela. This act sets her/him off the deep end and she/he begins to kill anyone who hurts her/him in any way.  Then to complicate matters she begins to have a relationship with Paul.  Angela has a gender identity crisis and cannot decide whether she/he is attracted to Paul or to other women.  It probably doesn't help her that she is surrounded by Men in booty shorts and half shorts, who would be mistaken for flamboyantly gay in today's culture.  So she decides to have a relationship with Paul and seems happy but he wants more, to feel her breasts, which of course she doesn't have.  Angela finally loses all control when she catches Paul cheating on her with Judy.  She brutally murders Judy by raping her with a curling iron.  Then she goes berserk and kills four younger children in their sleeping bags.  I think they kicked sand at her.  Then she decides to reveal her secret to Paul. And she does and promptly decapitates him.  Finally in the creepiest scene that I never saw coming she makes a crazy face with a gaping open mouth, ax in hand, completely naked and breathes heavily making slight animalistic noises.  This facial expression is comparable to one that Norman Bates makes dressed as the mother at the end of Psycho.  The sister of Marion is in the basement, finds the skeleton of the mother and then turns to see Norman dressed as the mother making a very similar crazy expression.  So in conclusion Psycho is a much more accurate comparison because both involve characters who are sexual confused, are men who dress as women, and kill when their sexual identites come into crisis.  I do not think Sleepaway Camp is a great movie, but had it better acting and special effects it could be. It is a thoroughly rich text.  The reason many people have responded to the ending, which I found shocking and disturbing and will unfortunately never leave me, is because it plays on deeply disturbing psychological events in people's lives.  And for that matter I think it is much scarier than a Friday the 13th or Nightmare on Elm Street which are basically about vengeance for the murder of a person.",Sleepaway Camp

This is the example how to with no budget, no actors and no talent, make a formula work! After watching movies like Scream, I know what you did last summer, Urban Legend, and many other titles who surround the ending twist, wile watching Sleepaway Camp, I doubt that you can't find out who's the killer! The storyline reminds me a little bit Terror Train, with a twist of Friday the 13th and a twist of Psicho.

269,JohnnyFlyTrap,Underrated Gem,8,15 February 2009,"""Sleepaway Camp"" is one of the more memorable slasher movies to emerge from the golden era of the genre. Acting and dialog aside, the movie is actually a deep, psychological parable disguised as a blood-filled romp through the woods. Like any great slasher film, it presents a surprising backstory that successfully paints our killer as a victim in their own right; by then end, we are almost sympathetic to Angela's psychological strain. More eerie and thought provoking than any Friday the 13th, ""Sleepaway Camp"" leaves a strong (if not creepy) impression on the brain that is not easy to shake. One might wonder what this film would have been like had they had a bigger budget and more resources to work with.",Sleepaway Camp

The acting isn't great, but this slasher uses actual teenagers in the roles, instead of 20 somethings playing teenagers, which I feel really enhances the film. It also has a compelling plot, about shy Angela, and a shocking twist at the end. It has some mean spirited characters that I found interesting, including a pedophile cook and the hapless camp owner who's exasperated at the murders being committed at the camp, along with all the kids bullying Angela. The kills, despite not being that gory are well done.It also has some funky 80's electro-music on the soundtrack, if I remember correctly.If you like old school slashers you'll probably love Sleepaway Camp.",Sleepaway Camp

When I started to watch it at home, I got about five minutes into it and the acting was so bad, and the gross pedo joke the guy made at the beginning was so distasteful to me I turned it off, figured I just wasted five bucks and put the tape in the basement. How wrong I was! A few years later, I was so bored at my house and since we had watched every other movie we owned, I remembered the tape in the basement and decided to sit through it.The acting in this movie is the worst acting I've ever seen and we had to just laugh at it to stop the pain of watching it. The special effects on the murder victims and the ways they are murdered are absolutely hilarious. But the twist at the end was what really made the movie.

This is a great movie for you and some friends (or a girlfriend)- there's some suspense, gory effects, and creative ideas throughout.

Yep predictable, though maybe not for the time it was made. Now I will say this movie was good and defiantly deserves a viewing if you like slasher cheese. Best part is almost everyone who dies deserves it so it adds a little guilty pleasure to the film. The movie itself is about shy Angela who is accompanied by her cousin to summer camp. Enter unbearable counselors, boring activities, camp bitches, and a perverted cook. So it's a regular Summer camp till everyone who picks on Angela start dropping like flies.

The last image is very permanent on my memory, and I thought it was a perfect end to this movie.

The Burning, The Prowler, and Sleepaway Camp.So last night I watched 'Sleepaway Camp'. This is the biggest piece of **** film I have seen in some time, and I have seen many.The acting is just absolutely *dreadful* with the entire cast coming off like they are remembering lines off cue cards. I cannot state this enough, even for an 80's horror movie. Horrible horrible horrible acting. I have seen Infomercials with better acting then this.The murder scenes were weak, boring and uncreative, ""yes let's kill someone with a wasps nest"" and the makeup effects looked like they were done by a high school student on a $5 Hobby Lobby budget.A slow and boring pace overall, with nonsensical rubbish scattered throughout the script like a pedophile working in the camp cafeteria, Meg cracking onto an ugly 60 year old guy for no reason absolutely what so ever, etc.The plot was also garbage. Don't get me started on that ridiculous disaster boating back story, the homophobic gay scene (because 2 men in love is something that disturbs children from affection later in life right?), and one of the worst ""twist"" endings ever thought up. Wow, so Angela who is afraid to go in the shower with the other girls is actually a boy who was raised by an Aunt (probably the worst actor in the movie along with Angela's cousin), who turned her into a girl. So Angela is actually a dude? So what? Who the hell cares and why is it even important? Psycho did the exact same thing 20 years earlier.And that's it folks, that's the ending. Angela is not a chick but a psycho killer who turns out to have male parts? We never see what happens to her/him, or exactly why her/him committed the killings - obviously just an angry trans gender getting revenge on everyone because of the boating accident (quite a stretch for revenge plot) and being ill treated by her/his aunt - good reason enough to go about throwing wasps nests through windows and drowning people. Worst of all, there is no end battle to speak of. They don't have to defeat the killer at all, the director just shows the reveal and that's it. The movie ends on Angela being a dude making some demented facial gesture, and that's it with a freeze frame and let's roll credits.Some people were comparing this movie to ""The Burning"", which I also watched recently for the first time ever. The Burning is actually a well directed scary horror movie of the 80's.

Having no clue what kind of movie this was, or its sequels, and being a fan of horror movies of all types, especialy from the 80's, i went ahead and purchased the box set. I still have not seen the other movies, but man, this was worth the price alone. Having obviously borrowed ideas and techniques from previously released slasher flicks Halloween and the original Friday the 13th, Sleepaway Camp is able to stand on its own. The story centers on two teenage cousins going to Camp Arawak for some fun, mindless summer fun. The boy, Ricky, is a veteran of the camp and is accompanying his shy and very quiet cousin, Angela. In a matter of days, ""accidents"" start to appear out of nowhere, and pretty soon, the councelors claim that there is a killer on the loose. For those who are not familiar with the early 80's and it's styles will find the movie enjoying. From the way they speak to the way they dress, it is a nice flashback to one of our more ""under appreciated"" time. The mullets and the Blue Oyster Cult shirt does not hurt either! However, the age of the film did hurt the film a bit. The killings were not as gruesome or detailed as i hoped they'd be, and the acting will make a majority of you laugh more than a few times. The movie drifts off in some rather unneccisary scenes which only slowed the pace down, and will probably frustrate you. But later on it does pick up and gets even better! So why should you check this film out? Well, if you are a fan of slashers and like movies like that and want to see something different than the ""classics"", i suggest you check this film out for some gaurantee fun.

The Aunt is hilarious, and probably one of the creepiest characters I've ever come by. And the ending, as you have noticed from all the other comments here, is crazy.

While the so-called ""shock ending"" is a bit of a frightening image, I think the most frightening image is that of the boy George-esquire aunt. ""No, that wouldn't do at all."" Less scary, more cannot stop laughing. For those of you who thought this film was actually horror-filled, I can see your point. Some of the murders are a little vivid, but all is horror is exceeded by hilarity with the random zoom-in after the boat accident of the man crying, ""John."" Obviously worried about his friend, his face looked like it had been practiced for hours (""Ok, if I nail this, this could be my big break!""). And ""sexy teens?"" I don't remember who wrote that, but ahem, R. Kelly alert. The kids, no older than 15-or at least look that way-defy being ""sexy."" To be honest, the wardrobe-so classically 80's-is enough to take away the scary.While this movie's concept is,in actuality, a frightening one, the execution fails miserably. It may have looked good in an outline form, but the corny dialogue, shockingly inappropriate music-the ending credit song is what kills me, tight short shorts, lack of an age limit for campers,curiosity of how someone could die in some of the creative ways invented in the film, and the question of why the counselors are such jerks to the little kids really ruins the air of shock and fear.

You can even see the distortion at the bottom of the movie like you get with video capture.On the odd side, this adds to the cheese of the movie.

Felissa Rose gives a great performance as Angela, and the rest of the cast and characters are very memorable. Katherine Kamhi and Karen Fields' characters are ridiculously mean and it's entertaining to watch. The death scenes were creative and fun, I still cross my legs thinking about how Judy met her end.
And despite all the goofy aspects of the film, the twist is actually one that makes you think for a bit after the credits roll. Sure, on the surface it's kind of an easy shock, but then you start thinking about the character and all the things Angela has had to do over the past 8 years to hide her true identity. It's genuinely upsetting to imagine Angela, such a sweet person, having to go through 8 years of literal torture just because her crazy aunt wanted a girl.

There are currently over 60 different horror remakes in different stages of production right now. The genre, which once thrived on creativity and originality, has become a machine, churning out the same old movie again and again. Studios think that with better CGI they can update old (and not so old) classics for a new audience. Most of the time (Amityville Horror, Black Christmas) they are wrong, but once in a while (The Thing, Dawn of the Dead 2004) a new masterpiece emerges.

And not because it's scary in a ""The Ring"", or even ""A Clockwork Orange"" kind of way.It's not disturbing because the acting, writing, dialogue, and cinematography (like, three minutes of random outdoor shots in the beginning which have nothing to do with opening scene of the movie) are bad enough to be downright confusing.It's disturbing for anyone with a background in school counseling, legal issues, or childcare in general. If you're like me, questions will run through your mind that will keep you awake at night. Questions like:""Why were pedophiles running a children's camp? """"Did places like this really exist in the '80s?""""Why were children allowed to play on a slanted roof?""""Why were 13-year-olds hanging out in a bar (canteen)?""""Why are all the adults cursing in front of the children?""""Why do all the adult characters have camel-toes and wedgies, even the men?""""Why didn't anyone think it was weird the cook was zipping up his pants as he was coming out of the walk-in cooler?""""Why is everyone so angry?""""Is it legal for 11-year-olds to say the F word that much?""""Was I just watching child pornography?""Then are the ""Why can't they...??"" moments in the film. Like, ""Why can't he just crawl out UNDER the bathroom door?"" ""Why can't the lifeguard hear her screaming from 10 feet away?"" ""Why can't they give him a more realistic-looking mustache?""The dialogue further confounds. Who says ""Oh, that's too bad,"" when they find a dead body? What teenager says, ""What say you and I go for a walk later?"" And why does Meg need to spell out her name (""M-E-G!"") in introductions?The casting, characters and tangential plot lines further serve to confound. How did John Waters miss out on Dr. Aunt for ""Desperate Living""? What kind of doctor was she supposed to be anyway? Why are all the male counselors dressed for a Olivia Newton-John ""Let's Get Physical"" video casting call? Why does dead dad have a gay lover? The answers to all of these question remain unknown.There are a few nuggets that make the first 84 minutes almost bearable: Death by curling iron, for instance. (No, she didn't use the cord.) And when ... well, there was that scene where ... I like the part ... OK, there is only one moment in the film that makes the first 84 minutes watchable.Yet, there is a reason this director (who apparently never saw Alfred Hitchcock's ""Psycho"") and this film has developed a cult following. There is a reason this movie has four sequels. Robot Chicken devoted 12 precious seconds to a parody. Bands have written lyrics (""Meet me at the waterfront after the social""), entire songs (""Angela,"" ""Angela's Secret"") and even named themselves (CKY-Camp Kill Yourself) after this movie. SocialTechPop lists Angela Baker as No. 2, just after the iconic Freddy Krueger, on its list of Top 10 Horror Movie Villains. Almost 30 years later, fans maintain several websites for this film.It's for the last 3 seconds. Watch it and thank me later.Better yet, thank Michelle Minervino.(And no, you shouldn't just fast-forward to the end, for the same reason you don't open your gifts until Christmas morning, the corpse pose doesn't come until the the end of the yoga routine and Jesus waited three days to be resurrected.

Oh wel... Horrible acting, bad dialogue, 80s stereotypes, unlikeable characters, and bad script dog down this flcik, my recommendation: Madman (1982)",Sleepaway Camp
301,ali_asst,complete garbage,1,21 March 2006,"Anyone who even remotely likes this sack of crap movie is in dire need of a full mental evaluation. Leave the house. Get a life. If you are a human being please, don't waste precious time viewing this abomination. I hated every second.It would seem homosexual pedophiles made this film. I use the word film very loosely because it is not a film in the traditional sense. 'Films' have actors in them. People who don't look at the camera every time it's in front of them. Actor's can act as well. Not one person delivered a believable line. No one. I tried to watch this movie with an open mind. Impossible. I will once again warn the people thinking of buying this thing. DON'T DO IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! If you want to drive someone out of your life permanently, give them this movie for Christmas. They will be gone. I would.",Sleepaway Camp
302,homeskillet1013,Worst movie ever made,1,26 January 2007,"Worst movie of all time. And it has the worst ending to any movie ever created. Do not watch this movie. It is total crap. Trust me. If you rent this movie you are wasting your money. If you have friends who are telling you it's the greatest horror movie ever, they are lying to you. That is not true. So many people think this movie is great and it is honestly the worst piece of film ever made. Your friends might think it's cool, but that is only because they think it is funny. It is actually not funny and it really sucks my balls. The rating given to this movie of a 5.1 out of 10 is about 5.1 points too high. It deserves nothing more than a 0. I personally refuse to vote on this movie because IMDb will not let me give a score of 0. I will not stoop so low as to give this movie a 1 out of 10. Please do not watch this crap. Love, The Playa Haters Ball",Sleepaway Camp
303,kristina_petkucevska,Old school banger,9,25 July 2018,"Let me just start by saying, when I sat down to watch this movie, I did not expect it to be any good. I wanted to watch an old school bad / not-so-scary slasher flick, and when I typed that into google it gave me Sleepaway Camp.Firstly, I love old school horrors. They're fun, thrilling, spooky and not over the top / sleep with the lights on scary. They're also pretty original and don't try so hard as horrors do today. When I sat down to watch Sleepaway Camp, I didn't anticipate it to be very scary so I switched off all my lights and sat alone to watch it. By the end of the movie, I was wrong. The final scene is so horrific that I sprang up and switched all my lights back on! I had to finish it that way!Sleepaway Camp is fun and constantly has you trying to guess the killer until the very end! I'm usually very good at predicting the endings of movies, but I was completely shocked with the end of this one! WATCH IT!",Sleepaway Camp
304,theweebro-76901,Great Film,10,3 April 2019,There is a reason this film is considered a cult classic. Even the non slasher film fans will enjoy this. It also has probably has one of the best plot twists in movie history,Sleepaway Camp
305,garthblumer,profoundly lame,4,23 April 2006,"why did i spend so much of my adolescence in pursuit of the means to view movies such as this? a status symbol of ones coolness, slasher flicks, or almost any other 'r' rated movie, was proof of ones position in the middle school social hierarchy. not bad if you persuaded a parent to take you, better if an older brother/sister brought you along, best if you somehow snuck in or, gasp, so cool, somehow managed to get the person working in the box-office to sell you the ticket directly. then what happens when we get to these movies, we realize they suck. sure, there were classics, 'nightmare on elm street,' but not part two, 'halloween,' but these movies were more or less abandoned for the eighties, and 'friday the 13th,' due in large part to the impact the first three in the series had on the generation directly before ours (high-school kids when we were in middle school.)",Sleepaway Camp
