0,bkoganbing,This family won't blend well,6,17 June 2018,"The Way Way Back has Toni Collette and her son Liam James going on a summer
beach vacation with the guy she's seeing Steve Carrell and his daughter Zoe Levin.
It is apparent right awaythat this family will not blend well like the Bradys did.
Carrell for instance really seems to enjoy putting down the very shy and socially
awkward James. He's a real lout, but possibly Collette figures she can't do any
better. Levin too puts James down and resents having to have him tag along and intrude in her social life. It doesn't look like it will be a happy summer vacation for James. But then he
falls in with Sam Rockwell who runs a water slide ride. Rockwell is a free spirited type and if he doesn't develop full confidence in himself, James does
come out of his shell. I'm agreeing with others who say this reminiscent of those John Waters films from the 80s. Liam James and Sam Rockwell have a great chemistry together
and their scenes are special.Funniest scene is Rockwell dealing with a human kid logjam in his water slide.
He uses his own special brand of drain cleaner to take care of the problem.This one's a good family film and Liam James is a real find.",The Way Way Back
1,SnoopyStyle,Very heart warming,7,12 April 2014,"Duncan (Liam James) is perpetually miserable teen and his mother Pam (Toni Collette) has a mean-spirited overbearing boyfriend Trent (Steve Carell). They and his bitchy daughter are going to his summer cottage for the season. On the way there Trent asks Duncan what number he is from 0 to 10. Duncan replies with a safe 6, and Trent tells him that he's just a 3. This is based on a real incident from writer/director Jim Rash's life as he and Nat Faxon create a dysfunctional family vacation and self discovery.The start of the movie is very miserable due to mostly Duncan's miserable life. I like the mostly 80s motif in this worn out vacation spot. Once Owen (Sam Rockwell) comes into the movie, it picks up emotionally. The water park is a relief. The audience is finally allowed to find joy. Sam Rockwell makes this movie good with his performance. It's a very heart warming movie with some good jokes.",The Way Way Back
2,Hitchcoc,The Kid Is Alright,7,3 January 2014,"I remember seeing My Bodyguard about a hundred years ago. The focus of that film is a young kid with little self esteem who is getting kicked around by his classmates. This led to a series of movies that had the premise that there were nasty guys around whose sole reason for existence was to bully some poor kid (Chris Makepiece/Ralph Machio). Ultimately, there was some person who had fallen from grace or led an unconventional, perhaps childlike existence, who offered ""the way"" to success. Most of them lived lives, distancing themselves from the establishment, attracting young people because they are really 40 year old peers. In this case we have a young man whose mother is engaged to Steve Carrel who is a complete ass. Carrel's character is verbally abusive and belittling to the young man. He offers little as a father figure. He is full of himself, pompous and has an opinion about everything. Naturally, the main character finds solace in the adult/child who works at a water park. The story is simplistic and heartwarming (not in a bad way). It's a decent diversion though no great shakes.",The Way Way Back
3,Horst_In_Translation,A front-runner for 2013,8,5 January 2014,"This film is the first directorial effort by Jim Rash and Nat Faxon. Both have done quite a bit of work in other film-related areas in their careers, especially in acting. However, the two also won the Academy Award for writing Alexander Payne's ""The Descendants"" (starring George Clooney) not too long ago and ""The Way Way Back"" shows us how prolific and talented they are as they directed, wrote and produced the film and also appear in smaller roles here and successfully deliver comic relief. I quite loved ""The Descendants"", yet I managed not to get my hopes too far up with this one. The result was me being very positively surprised as I ended up liking it pretty much the same like ""The Descendants"".The lead actor here is Liam James. He does a fine job with a character that is, despite his age and his shyness, possibly the most normal character in the entire movie, certainly more normal than many of the other characters herein that are twice or even thrice his age. As the cast includes actors that have been working for decades, it's even more impressive how James manages to be on par with them and how he's never in danger of being overshadowed by the likes of Rockwell, Rudolph, Carell, Collette or Janney. Certainly his work in the film ""2012"" or as a regular on several TV shows (such as Psych) has helped him a lot in gaining the necessary experience to carry this movie and give us one of the finest 2013 portrayals in a coming-of-age movie. The film itself runs for slightly over 100 minutes and, even if it was very good, still felt like it had a lot more to offer than it finally did. That includes among other things the story of Susanna and her mother which seemed truly interesting, even if we only got very small portions from the grand picture behind it and it could certainly justify a spin-off.Beyond that, the film is a big Sam Rockwell showcase. He basically steals the show from everybody the moment he enters the screen in a hilarious scene involving the computer game classic Pac-Man. From that moment on, we are watching him turn more and more turn into a father figure to the main character with every minute. Rockwell breathes life into a pretty unique character who's quite a force of nature, but still has quite a few flaws, which make him even more interesting to watch. He's a crucial figure in this year's maybe most successful film about a character coming of age. It has lots of drama, but still equally much heart and humor. As much as I'm concerned, I sometimes need a while, maybe even up to half an hour, to really get into a movie, but this one had me on the edge of my seat since minute one when the characters of James, Collette and Carell are in the car and talk about grading people. It was quite a sad situation already, but also one that perfectly introduced the trio's characteristics to the audience very early on. And this grading process was referenced nicely near the end with the ""friend of the 3""-scene. Excellent way in closing the circle. The final scene is back in the car again, so it's a bit of a framework for everything that happened in between, but the situation has clearly changed position-wise and character-wise at that point due to everything that happened in-between.All in all, I very much recommend this movie. It's a pretty entertaining 100 minute-dramedy. The comedy is occasionally subtle, but often also very much in your face as a huge part of the film takes place at a water park which obviously means lots of fun with squirt guns, water slides and splashing everywhere. One of my favorite funny scenes was when the heavy black kid went down the slide to dissolve the children stuck in there. This one was completely hilarious. It's not a perfect film, for example I didn't like the scene that much where the protagonist meets this group of dancers with the crowds around them and was told to get them away and that Rockwell's character of course foresaw the unlikely development that the kid would sort of join them, despite his very deep-rooted shyness still at that point, and the whole changing positions in the water slide subplot wasn't half as effective as it aimed to be for me, but that's just minor criticisms, which, by no means, should keep you from seeing this movie.",The Way Way Back
4,Prismark10,The Way Way Back,6,23 April 2020,Nat Faxon and Jim Rash won an Oscar for being two of the co writers of The Descendants.Both have written and directed The Way Way Back about an introverted teenager who comes out of his shell on an extended summer break to a small town near Cape Cod.Duncan (Liam James) is 14 years old shy and insecure. His divorced mother Pam (Toni Collette) her condescending boyfriend Trent (Steve Carell) who is a jerk and Trent's stuck up daughter Steph (Zoe Levin) all come to stay at a guest house.Duncan strikes up a friendship with happy go lucky water park manager Owen (Sam Rockwell.) Duncan gets a job at the water park and quickly becomes one of the team. His mother and Trent fail to notice the changes in Duncan who is upset that Trent is cheating on his mum.This is a quirky comedic coming of age film. It is not earth shattering original. It has too many cliched characters but is a lot of fun thanks to Rockwell's performance.,The Way Way Back
5,nogodnomasters,CARRY A LASER,8,22 June 2019,"Duncan (Liam James) is a 14 year old boy who is in an extreme awkward stage minus the zits. His mom (Toni Collette) is dating Trent (Steve Carell) who is overly pretentious and made unlikable. Trent has a teen daughter Steph (Zoe Levin) who is self centered. Duncan lives in a shell, but has taken a shine to Owen (Sam Rockwell) an out going adult who works at the local water slide where the modern family is summer vacationing.Owen befriends Duncan and instills confidence in him. Duncan makes friends with the cutie and moody neighbor teen (AnnaSophia Robb) who sees her mother as irresponsible just as Duncan sees Trent and his mom. We see the world through the eyes of a teen as if once wasn't enough.The film is a heart warming comedy. It touches on a number of family themes, but never drives home a point, or perhaps allows the audience to gather whatever meaning they desire. Worth seeing.Parental Guide: IMDB claims 1 f-bomb. I missed it. There is other adult language including the ""C"" word. Pot smoking. No sex or nudity.",The Way Way Back
6,kosmasp,A good way,9,14 June 2014,"The Way Way back is a movie that is just enticing, from start to finish. Obviously not everyone is into movies that are close to reality and I do like my over the top action movies too. But this is a coming of age story that deserves to be seen. While some of the best jokes are inside the trailer, there is so much more here to explore. Sam Rockwell is really great.Actually more than great. While you can see the flaws of his character, he is so magical that you wish you could be there with that character, just talking to him. Of course the ""boy"", our lead character and everybody else, are as charismatic as he is. Which takes the wonderful dialog to another level. The story is pretty simple, but the tweaks it involves do get you to be involved. A really great movie, with a great script and great performances",The Way Way Back
7,michaelRokeefe,A stifled teen finally finds encouragment.,9,2 June 2014,"A feel good movie about a 14 year old boy that is lacking in social graces and self esteem. Duncan(Liam James)is too shy to make friends, and it sure isn't easy for him. Living with his mom Pam(Toni Collette)and her obnoxious boyfriend Trent(Steve Carell),he is victim of over-protection and given little encouragement. The family is to take a summer vacation to Trent's beach home. Duncan is an embarrassment to his would-be step-sister and an easy whipping boy for Trent and his downgrading and psychological abuse. Pam overlooks her boyfriends actions and just won't stand up for her son. Finally the young boy escapes his unbearable home life and is befriended by the manager of a local water park. Owen(Sam Rockwell)possesses a wild, no boundaries, easy come...easy go attitude toward life; and he gives Duncan a job that ends up letting him break from his shell. Unbelievable that Owen finally gives Duncan someone to look up to. The 14 year old soon realizes he can stand up to his mom's boyfriend and even show her she does not have to settle in life.Is this a coming of age flick or just a film showing how to break the chains of a dismal life with a fresh attitude and welcomed pats on the back. I went through several emotions and actually think Rockwell is a pivotal character in this movie. He is really a hoot. Allison Janney's character is a real headache; while Maya Rudolph provides straight face humor bouncing off of Rockwell. Others in the cast: Annasophia Robb, Zoe Levin, Amanda Peet, Nat Faxon and Rob Corddry. I'm having no trouble watching this one again!",The Way Way Back
8,studioAT,"Good, but not as good as it should've been",2,29 May 2017,"This is one of those quirky teen films that is trying to be just like the big quirky teen film that went before it.However, the problem is that it's not half as funny or as quirky, or indeed as good as it likes to think it is.The big name cast is in place, and does its best with the material, but there's something lacking from this film to make it of the same standard as 'Little Miss Sunshine' or 'Juno', of which this film shares some of the creatives.It's a shame because there's a lot to like here, but it doesn't all gel together successfully.",The Way Way Back
9,grantss,"Sweet, charming, entertaining movie",7,25 May 2014,"Sweet, charming, entertaining movie. Not overly profound or overly mentally taxing, but it works. Quirky, feel-good plot. Some good comedic moments too.Good relationship and human drama. You can relate to all of the characters. Decent performances from a star-studded cast. For once Steve Carell plays the bad guy, and plays him pretty straight. Sam Rockwell maybe overdoes the quips and non-seriousness a bit too much, but that is probably more the fault of the script.Good performance by Liam James in essentially the lead role (even though he doesn't get top billing).Great soundtrack too: the songs are perfect for the movie.",The Way Way Back
10,george.schmidt,"Echoes of ""The Flamingo Kid"", ""Meatballs"" and ""Adventureland"". Rockwell steals the movie.",8,16 July 2013,"THE WAY,WAY BACK (2013) *** Steve Carell, Toni Collette, Allison Janney, AnnaSophia Robb, Sam Rockwell, Maya Rudolph, Liam James, Rob Corddry, Amanda Peet, River Alexander, Zoe Levin, Nat Faxon, Jim Rash. Summer vacation coming-of-age comedy with mopey teen James forced to stay with his mom and her jerk boyfriend for the season and makes the most of it by discovering a new life at the local water park. With a fine ensemble cast (including writers/novice-directing team Faxon and Rash) the film coasts on its breezy screenplay and fun field day run by Rockwell (getting in touch with his inner Bill Murray/Walter Matthau) as the slacker employee who befriends the kid but the tenuous tension by the abrasive miscasting of Carell sinks the possibility of a dramedy (or even a real moment of James getting even with the jerk stepfather-wannabe).

11,neil-476,A delight,9,20 September 2013,"14-year old Duncan, forced to stay for the summer at his Mom's boyfriend's summer house, finds unlikely comrades in the next door neighbour's daughter and the manager of a nearby water park.This rather slight film has some star power in the cast, but centres around Duncan himself. Liam Curtis as Duncan is on screen through most of the film, and for much of the running time is not required to do anything other than appear sullen and sulky. While this is appropriate for the plot, the lack of emotional variation for Duncan until late in the film is the one weak point in an otherwise charming and uplifting coming of age film.Sam Rockwell must have given his agent a bonus when this script arrived, for his part is by far the showiest and most entertaining. Steve Carell's character has come in for criticism: I felt he was flawed rather than wicked, and Carell plays him well. Anna-Sophia Robb continues to move confidently towards adult parts, Toni Collette plays a believable Mom caught between trying to make a new future for herself while maintaining her responsibilities towards the son she loves, and Alison Janney has a ball as awful but likable next-door neighbour Betty. It is worth mentioning young River Alexander, whose lazy-eyed Peter gets an unexpected moment in the spotlight. I liked this film a great deal, and recommend it.",The Way Way Back
12,evanston_dad,One 80s Summer,6,5 December 2013,"""The Way Way Back"" is an amiable if uninspired film in the ""adolescent summer angst"" genre. These are the movies that feature a teenager (usually a boy) who begins his summer bored, listless and misunderstood and comes out on the other side of it a more mature and self-accepting version of himself, usually due to a romance or a friendship or some combination of the two. Movies like this were hugely popular in the 1980s and always starred someone like John Cusack or Patrick Dempsey.The creators of ""The Way Way Back"" (Oscar winners Jim Rash and Nat Faxon, who collaborated with Alexander Payne on the screenplay for ""The Descendants"" and who both have roles in this film) obviously look back on those 80s films with nostalgia, as ""The Way Way Back"" is dripping with it. ""Star Wars"" action figures and Air Supply get honorable mentions, as does some break dancing. In fact it's almost distracting after a while that the film isn't actually set in the 80s, because it feels like it should be. It doesn't bring much of anything new to the genre, but it's perfectly enjoyable at delivering on its modest ambitions.Sam Rockwell is partly irritating and partly winning as a mentor to the awkward teen at the heart of this particular story. He clearly thinks the endless stream of one-liners he's been given to recite are funnier than we think they are, but he's a good enough actor and likable enough screen presence to mostly overcome the mediocre material. Steve Carrell proves that he can play d*ckhead like nobody's business, while Toni Collette, always a welcome addition to any film, is stuck with the thankless role of doormat mom. It's Allison Janney, as a blowsy neighbor, who steals this show. She charges on to the screen like a hurricane and manages to land every line she's given.Grade: B",The Way Way Back
13,ferguson-6,Water Wizzdom,7,7 July 2013,"Greetings again from the darkness. OK, before you accuse me of being the world's worst speller, you should know that my title ""Water Wizzdom"" is a play on words ... the waterpark in the film is known as Water Wizz and Sam Rockwell plays Owen, the man-child mentor to Liam James' Duncan. Duncan is a miserable 14 year old stuck in a beach house with his mom, her obnoxious boyfriend, and his snobby daughter.Steve Carell plays Trent, the condescending and bullying boyfriend who has no redeeming qualities that we can see (other than the beach house and a nice tan). Duncan's mom is played by Toni Collette, and her character Pam is a divorced, insecure single mom trying to balance her own happiness with that of her teen-angst-filled son. Pam and Duncan are the outsiders in this beach community as we quickly learn when next door neighbor Betty (Allison Janney) shows up with drink in hand and gossip for all.The well worn movie signs are all here ... we recognize the characters and their struggles, in fact, we all know someone like each of the people that co-writers and co-directors Nat Faxon and Jim Rash present to us. We understand quickly that this is yet another coming-of-age tale with mostly clueless adults. Despite that, this one still mostly works. The writing and acting are such high quality that even though we are living in movie cliché-land, we still find ourselves caring about Duncan and Pam, laughing at Owen, and tossing tomatoes at Trent (Carell).Special recognition to Sam Rockwell. Even though Duncan is the key character, it's Rockwell's Owen who recognizes that a little faith and encouragement goes a long way. Behind the facade of rapid-fire banter and laugh-inducing one-liners, Owen is coming to grips with a life of reality and shattered dreams. While never stooping to the typical Hollywood ""win one for the Gipper"" speech, Owen manages to instill a bit of confidence in Duncan ... to the point where he refuses to let his mother pretend everything is OK with Trent.AnnaSophia Robb plays the cute girl-next-door who recognizes potential in Duncan, but the filmmakers never allow this to turn into some ridiculous fairy tale. Instead we get characters who are each flawed, but real and recognizable. While all the typical pieces are present, there is enough crackle to the dialogue and quality acting to help this one rise above the usual muck. It's a nice ""little"" alternative to the giant summer blockbusters. Nat Faxon and Jim Rash won an Oscar for co-writing The Descendants with Alexander Payne. In their directorial debut, they prove that they also have skills as filmmakers. The next one could be even better!",The Way Way Back
14,FlashCallahan,It's called delegation baby......,9,26 January 2014,"Duncan goes on summer vacation with his mother, her overbearing boyfriend, and her boyfriend's daughter. Having a rough time fitting in, Duncan finds an unexpected friend in Owen, manager of the water park.....2013 was a year of real surprises, the majority of the big summer releases were very poor, and then inbetween we had quality movies, that didn't get such a wide release, and this is a prime example of that kind of film.Despite some dark narrative regarding Duncan's mother and her boyfriend, the film is a really feel good movie, which is really strange considering Duncan's maundering personality for the first half of the movie.The sunshine enters the film, when we meet Owen, the movies Ace card and a career best performance from Rockwell. The mans swagger is hilarious, and no matter how immature his behaviour is, or how derogatory he is with his humour, you just cannot help but like the characters every trait.But he's there for a better purpose, and that's to turn Duncan's frown upside down, and realise he's more than a 3' and the movie is at its most touching when the two have little moments.Carrell is also brilliant as the cynical boyfriend, a million miles away from the character you'd expect.Its a wonderful movie from beginning to end, easily one of the best of 2013, and if a flume ride can reduce you to tears, it's doing something right....",The Way Way Back
15,phd_travel,Worth one watch but not a classic,8,18 October 2013,"This is a well put together movie about a young boy and his mother staying with her new boyfriend at his summer beach house. This movie has a bunch of good points, good acting humor story dialog casting, that each on their own aren't exceptional but all together make a nice pleasing package.Liam James as Duncan has got the miserable teen thing down quite well. Toni Collette is good as always as the doormat self centered mother. Steve Carell plays against his usual annoying goody type as a no good boyfriend. Alison Janney plays a good neighbor. Anna Sophia Robb plays the young love interest. Sam Rockwell as a water park employee who befriends Duncan.The dialog is good but could be better in parts especially Sam Rockwell's jokes are a bit strained. The main dramatic climax is quite moving but there isn't quite enough resolution at the end just a hint which felt a bit lacking. The romance also feels a bit cut short although the friendship is touching.It's pleasing and worth a watch but not a classic.",The Way Way Back

The teen finds a quasi-mentor (Sam Rockwell) at a water park while developing a friendship with the cute neighbor girl (AnnaSophia Robb). Toni Collette plays the mother, Allison Janney a friend and Amanda Peet a flirty woman.""The Way Way Back"" (2013) is a coming-of-age flick that meshes elements of films like ""The Squid and the Whale"" (2005), ""The Summer of '42"" (1971), ""Meatballs"" (1979), ""Swimming"" (2000) and ""Lawn Dogs"" (1997), but this is arguably the best of them.Part of the genius of the movie is that the potential stepfather (Carell) isn't made out to be totally evil nor is the seeming mentor (Rockwell) perfect. They're both flawed men with presumably good intentions toward the boy, but only one proves that he's a worthy father-figure. Moreover, the all-around writing/acting smacks of real life.AnnaSophia is super cute on the female front while Zoe Levin is alluring as the pouty, bratty stepsister. Meanwhile Andria Blackman has a standout cameo as the girl in a yellow bikini.The film runs 1 hour, 43 minutes, and was shot in the Cape Code region of Massachusetts: Wareham & nearby Onset; Marshfield & nearby Duxbury.GRADE: A/A-",The Way Way Back
17,zetes,Cliché,5,17 December 2013,"The directorial debut of two of the Oscar winning co-screenwriters of The Descendants, Nat Faxon and Jim Rash. It's a coming of age story set over the summer. Sad sack Liam James accompanies his mother and her boyfriend (Toni Collette and Steve Carrell) to his summer home. James is extremely unhappy about it - he dislikes Carrell and wishes to be with his father for the summer. His only respite from the misery is the local waterpark, where he befriends slacker and wisdom-spewer Sam Rockwell. This film is an utter cliché. It isn't even the only coming of age movie from 2013 about a kid who spends a summer working in a water park (the other being The To Do List, which isn't any good either, but it's better than this). James in particular is such a dull and unengaging central character. The whole film suffers from his moping. Rockwell, who is indeed the best thing about it, seems to be working overtime to liven up the proceedings, and he comes off as overcompensating. AnnaSophia Robb plays James' love interest, and is also pretty uninteresting. Allison Janney is in it for a while, playing the same braying jackass she does in every film. I never realized how much I despised her until she popped up at the beginning of the movie. Thankfully, she pretty much disappears. The film also stars Maya Rudolph, Rob Corddry, Amanda Peet and the co-directors themselves (Jim Rash has the second best role in the movie, as another worker at the park who keeps swearing he's going to get away from the place). As for 2013's coming of age movies, I much prefer The Kings of Summer, which at least has an original sense of humor.",The Way Way Back
18,siderite,Nice coming of age movie,9,7 April 2014,"I have to rate this movie high enough because, even if it is a ""push all the right buttons"" film, it does it well. First there is the courage of the casting with the pretty much unknown Liam James starring in a movie where Steve Carell is not a comedian, but a macho douchebag and Sam Rockwell in an important, yet secondary role, while Amanda Peet and AnnaSophia Robb are playing really small roles. Then it is the story, which is not trying to cardboard any character, rather letting them evolve within the scene.The plot is simple enough: a 14 year old kid going in a summer vacation with his mother and her annoying boyfriend and hating every moment of it. He finds a water park nearby and forms a friendship with one of the people working there and also gets his first kiss from the girl next door, similarly afflicted by bad parenting. A sweet no morals movie that makes one relive childhood in a simple and direct way. Well done!",The Way Way Back
19,StevePulaski,"Sleep soundly, teenage lost souls; you have another sympathetic voice",10,19 July 2013,"The Way, Way Back is the summer movie event I've been waiting for, and it isn't likely to gross anything close to what the summer movie you've been waiting for will gross. During the summer season - in the midst of movies about fast cars, battling robots, star-studded folderol, immediate blockbusters, unexpected flops, tiresome sequels, tiresome prequels, predictable remakes, and the onslaught of superhero films - I try and seek out independent films that have the poor fortune of opening the same weekend as other, bigger films do that play in ten times the amount of theaters as well.The Way, Way Back has the unfortunate luck of opening on the same weekend as four other films that will likely take the four of the five spots at the box office this weekend, which are Red 2, R.I.P.D, Turbo, and The Conjuring. How sad that is seeing as if The Way, Way Back has even half the marketing budget as one of those films it could probably snag a spot in there with those films. I can see a current teenage lost soul, scrolling the internet or the newspaper for a movie to watch and sighing at how there is nothing of interest to him. The thought he may or may not see an advertisement or a blurb for this film breaks my heart.The story revolves around fourteen year old Duncan (Liam James), whose sulky expression will likely break your heart too. He is an anti-social, friendless teenager who is vacationing at his mother's boyfriend's summer home for a few weeks. His mother Pam (Toni Collette) is well-meaning, but kind of blind in terms of taking hints, Trent (Steve Carell), his mom's boyfriend, is a condescending bastard, and his daughter Steph (Zoe Levin) wants absolutely nothing to do with anyone.Duncan tries to connect to the area, but finds such a thing hard to do when everyone would rather be off somewhere else rather than where he is at. His next door neighbor Suzanna (the lovely and now thankfully diverse AnnaSophia Robb) finds that the two can connect on a personal level, but keep things collectively unromantic for the most part. Duncan later makes a strong connection with Owen (the scene-stealing Sam Rockwell), a quick-witted employee at a local waterpark. Duncan winds up getting employed there and bonding with the eccentric locals such as work-minded Caitlyn (Maya Rudolph) and the suit-rental clerk Lewis (co-director Jim Rash), while attempting to tolerate the crew back at home, made up of the tell-it-like-it-is Betty (Allison Janney) and the smiley neighbor Joan (Amanda Peet).A few years ago there was a film called Adventureland, about a group of twentysomethings who worked at a cheap theme park, while trying to bond and make the most out of a current situation. The film unfortunately advertised ""from the producers of Superbad"" on posters and commercials, making audiences think they were in for a ribald comedy rather than a meditation on post-college boredom and uncertainty. The Way, Way Back feels like the Adventureland on a scale aimed more at the teenage, high school demographic, which is viable material in itself.What writing/directing team Nat Faxon and Jim Rash (who penned the Oscar-nominated script for The Descendants) do to make the film not just viable but extraordinary is give every character their own identity and their own time to shine. Faxon and Rash concoct a believable landscape, not too quirky and not too shallow, that allows for each actor to utilize their material effectively. Consider Liam James, who will undoubtedly get critiqued a bit too harshly for maintaining the sulky persona for a bit too long in the film. What Faxon and Rash try to illustrate here is the anxiety and confused array of emotions teenagers house inside them, especially at this age. The character becomes developed as time goes on, and his slowburn development is likely quicker than many teenagers' over the course of years. James plays this tricky character remarkably well.It only helps he is assisted by a cast of charmers who will likely not be completely known by a mainstream audience. Sam Rockwell makes every scene he is in a quiet, but lovable triumph, Maya Rudolph and Jim Rash do excellent work as his coworkers, Toni Collette is unsurprisingly great in the conflicted mother-role, Allison Janney's perkiness makes her a good candidate for comedies in the future, and additional supporting characters such as Amanda Peet and Rob Corddry all get their effective time to shine. And it would be criminal not to mention how well Steve Carell handles the narcissistic, assertive persona here. His change of pace from the always likable guy, to the is-he-really-mean-or-are-we-too-soft character will continue to make him a wonderful character actor.Last year, we had the incredible Perks of Being a Wallflower, which was the teen film of not just 2012 but the new decade. In 2013, we have a lovable runner-up. The warm sincerity of The Way, Way Back may make for a beautiful DVD cover, but the film packs an emotionally honest, realistic wallop, making this the first truly touching sentiment I've seen all year. It's evident that Faxon and Rash what life is like from a teenage-perspective, when everything is confusing, nothing seems to be explainable, and everything is said to be too complicated for you to understand, and know how to make it an homage to the wonderful comedies of decades past such as Meatballs. The thought that the teenage community may in fact have another cinematic voice absolutely warms my heart.NOTE: My video review of The Way, Way Back, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-vVQYY_1Tg",The Way Way Back
20,blanbrn,Good coming of age movie that makes you think back to your childhood!,7,30 August 2013,"Finally saw ""The Way Way Back"" before the summer was over and I must say it was one little cute and fun film. One that after watching makes a lot of us remember our childhood, and growing up with personal and social problems like being shy and noticing girls for the first time. The story set in an eastern shore beach vacation getaway town has 14 year old Duncan(Liam James)a shy boy who decides to spend his summer with his mother Pam(Toni Collette)and her new boyfriend Trent(Steve Carell).

21,lasttimeisaw,a competent dramedy!,7,25 January 2014,"Director debut from Oscar-winning writer-duo Nat Faxon and Jim Rash (THE DESCENDANTS 2011, 8/10), a diffident but sensitive 14-year-old boy Duncan (James) unwillingly spends the summer vacation with his mother Pam (Collette) and her new boyfriend Trent (Carell) in a beach house where he cannot fit in and is constantly under strains with the domineering Trent, coincidentally he forms a bond with Owen (Rockwell), a happy-go-lucky clerk in the local water land ""Water Whizz"", after clandestinely takes a part-time job there, Duncan experiences the time of his life and the dreary summer does't seem to be so unbearable. Opens with Steve Carell drives a revamped station wagon, Collette is asleep in the passenger's seat, James sits in the way back seat facing backward, plus we foreknow a blue-chip ensemble with Rockwell, Janney, Peet, Rudolph and Robb, is it another deletable family confection like LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE (2006, 9/10)? The very first conversation between Trent and Duncan shatters this speculation, Duncan has a rough road in this summer retreat, soon it turns out his presumable step-father is not only a pathological doctrinaire, but a two-timing sleaze-bag. The discordance also arises between Duncan and Pam, a typical miscommunication between a mother and her teenage son, Pam is an escapist seeks for protection under the roof of a marriage and is willingly to blindly ignore any snags on her way, but Duncan is a disgruntled son never understand why she cannot find someone better.Supporting players galore, Duncan gets closer with Susanna (Robb), the next-door girl whose mother Betty (Janney) is a vexing garrulous boozehound, the amiable attachment between Duncan and Susanna is handled with care, realistic and never go overboard. Amanda Peet is perpetually underused as the third wheel old flame and Steve Carell assumes the villain role with dead seriousness with Zoe Levin as his haughty daughter, a bad exemplar of the ugly facet of our young generation. Collette accomplishes the duck soup with tangible nuances as a mother stuck in a morass.But the most enthralling and funny part of the film is certainly located in Water Whizz, Rockwell is at the top his game with almost ad lib ambidexterity of spontaneity and sincerity, it is not so often to watch him engage in an otherwise mono-layer character, he is so ready for more awards recognition. Rash and Naxon also participate in the film and generate laughters as two buffoonish co-workers. The film comes to the end as nothing ever happened, the hurtful truth, the unpleasant kerfuffle, Duncan has found his happy place but has to move on, however the positive message spreads from the very last scene renders viewers a firm conviction, life sucks, nevertheless, we can progress, even with baby steps.",The Way Way Back
22,KineticSeoul,More than a feel good movie,8,29 October 2013,"I really enjoyed the heart and message that went with this coming of age movie. Nothing about it really seemed pretentious, and the bonds seemed realistic and believable. Steve Carell is known for playing likable comedic characters, but in this he is a utter prick as the stepfather. Anyways, the story focuses in on a young teenage boy named Duncan(who has a slight case of down-syndrome) who goes to a relatives house on his stepfather's side of the family. But has difficult time fitting in, mainly because of their immature judgmental hypocrisy. And feels miserable with his time there, especially because his stepfather is a real jerk to him and because he cheats on his mom. Despite his unhappiness, he meets Owen(Sam Rockwell) who runs a small water park. I usually don't like sarcastic characters, but he is a lovable guy. Maybe it's because of his young at heart while also having a will to understand others approach that moved me. He is the character that shows Duncan how to enjoy the simple things in life. Usually it's a girl that the boy encounters that makes a difference but this one goes in a bit of a different approach. Although there is a girl that kind of has a liking to Duncan, but that subplot doesn't really lead anywhere. Unlike movies like ""It's Kind of a Funny Story"". But doesn't really take anything away from this film either. This is a touching movie and I couldn't help but smirk a bit most of the way through. Duncan is just a really likable character. Even when it comes to the end, I appreciated how it doesn't go in that cookie-cutter direction but also gives hope in the process. The connection and relationships kept building into something heartfelt. This movie made me happy, it's a feel good movie with substance to it. It's a movie about how sometimes when you meet that person with heart and understanding, it can make a big difference.8.7/10",The Way Way Back
23,Hellmant,A lot like 'ADVENTURELAND' but funnier and the cast is slightly better!,9,2 August 2013,"'THE WAY WAY BACK': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Excellent coming-of-age comedy drama film featuring an outstanding all-star cast and marking the feature film directorial debut of actors Nat Faxon and Jim Rash. The duo also co-wrote the film (other writing credits for the two include co-writing the Academy Award winning screenplay to the 2011 George Clooney drama 'THE DESCENDANTS', with the director Alexander Payne). The cast features the likes of Steve Carell, Sam Rockwell, Toni Collette, Allison Janney, AnnaSophia Robb, Rob Corddry, Amanda Peet, Maya Rudolph and Faxon and Rash themselves. 16-year-old Liam James impressively stars in the film. It's sweet and true to life but above all it's hilarious (despite it's clichés).James plays Duncan, a 14-year-old recluse who is forced to go on summer vacation with his mom, Pam (Collette), and her abusive boyfriend Trent (Carell), as well as his self centered older teenage daughter Steph (Zoe Levin), despite the fact that he wants to go live with his father. Once there he meets the carefree owner of a Walter Wizz water park (Rockewell), named Owen. Owen gives him a job and a new reason to live as he also develops feelings for a neighbor girl named Susanna (Robb). The film was inspired by the experiences of Rash with his own step-father. The film is classic loner teen-angst drama, the kind I can really relate to but filmmakers have made so many movies on the same subject. That's probably why I want to be a filmmaker; we're all the same and all trying to tell our self loathing (wanting to fit in) story. Audiences seem to love it though and constantly make the people they used to torment rich for telling that story (about how they always mistreat them). It's a good theme though and this one is especially well told. It reminds me a lot of the 2009 Jesse Eisenberg loner coming-of-age film (one of the many) 'ADVENTURELAND', which was set at an amusement park job over a life lesson learning summer). This one is funnier though and the cast is slightly better (although James is no Jesse Eisenberg). Rockwell has never been more likable or funny, Janney as well and Carell has never been more unlikeable (which is a little odd to see but in a really honest and realistic way). You can really relate to what this kid is going through having to deal with him as an annoying antagonistic substitute father. All of the cast is great though and it's hard to say if any one performance outshines the others. I'd go with the three I stated, although James is pretty good in the lead role as well (despite not being as talented as Eisenberg). Faxon and Rash also delivered a nearly flawless script and directed it quite stunningly (for a debut performance), so the cast definitely isn't the only thing this movie has going for it. It just works on all levels and is a really magical and powerful film (especially if you can relate to it at all, which I'm sure many can).Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_1fzjYYyuk",The Way Way Back
24,thesar-2,"I Wanna Go Way, Way Back to This",10,3 November 2013,"What a wonderful little film The Way Way Back was and the best coming-of-age film since The Perks of Being a Wallflower last year.It was nice to see Steve Carell step out as an ass – a first for him from what I've seen, and for once, I finally liked Sam Rockwell.To elaborate, I'm not a Rockwell fan at all, and I've seen a great deal of his movies (Seven Psychopaths, Cowboys & Aliens, Iron Man 2, Gentlemen Broncos, Moon, Frost/Nixon, Choke, The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford, Joshua, Confessions of a Dangerous Mind, Charlie's Angels, Galaxy Quest and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1990.) Wow, that's a lot.) Not once during those did I like him. Seriously, he never impressed me and was always, with the exception of Galaxy Quest, was a distraction. That changed here.My eyes rolled the brief moment he came on screen briefly. I hadn't known he was in this. Butonce he had a speaking scene, I fell madly in love with his character and he had me rolling in laughter until the end. And he wasn't just funny, he played (very well) an awesome character, someone I'd like to know in real life.Beyond him, the rest of the cast was pitch-perfect in their roles. The movie felt real in every scene and despite being fiction, this film was genuine step-by-step. It was sad, heartbreaking even and yet, uplifting and funny.Basically, the movie revolves around a coming-of-age boy at a beach house with his wacky neighbors, sexy (to him) daughter of the neighbor, summer job and dysfunctional family.The movie should be seen by all. They don't make many of these kinds these days. I continuously marveled on how much I loved this movie and could put myself in multiple character's shoes. This is a gem I can't wait to revisit many times.* * * Final thoughts: Okay, fine. I'll give Rockwell another chance. It only takes one movie for me to realize I might be wrong on someone I dislike.",The Way Way Back
25,Robert_duder,"A fantastic coming of age comedy, finally a companion to Little Miss Sunshine",9,20 October 2013,"I love a good coming of age film and to find a truly unique, solid indie comedy is rare. Little Miss Sunshine was one of the best examples of this, one of my all time favourites easily. The Descendants was also a huge surprise to me, turned out it was a fantastic film written by Nat Faxon and Jim Rash who also penned The Way Way Back and knocked another one out of the park. This film is funny, sweet, quirky, brilliantly acted in some cases and just simply outrageous fun. This isn't even the sort of dark comedy that isn't laugh out loud funny. This absolutely had me laughing out loud several times as well as feeling tears in my eyes, rooting for the characters and enjoying every single minute of it. It was simply brilliantly written and perfectly cast. Perhaps my only critique was that the ending of the film felt a little bit rushed and even felt a little bit unsatisfying. It wasn't terrible, there was nothing about this film that was terrible but I suppose I wanted to see Duncan and his Mom stay at the waterfront or return to the cabin or something like that. Initially, I thought the film was ending as they left and I was extremely disappointed but the writers definitely redeemed that with the final water slide scene.Liam James is absolutely perfect as the completely awkward Duncan. He goes through such an awesome transformation and he subtly works his way into your heart and wins you over. He is fantastic without being over the top or overacting in any way. Toni Collette is his Mom and she is good too. I really enjoy Collette and she has had some fantastic roles. This performance was not as good as some of her others and she is kept in the background a little and doesn't really get a chance to shine but she is still very good in her role. Steve Carell is mesmerizing and brilliant in his role as the overbearing jack-ass boyfriend of Collette who treats James' Duncan really poorly. Carell is such a talented actor when he's not being stupid (Burt Wonderstone for instance) and this shows how terrific he can be. He channels a Robin Williams type dramatic performance and that is a great compliment. Allison Janney is perfectly hilarious as the wild mouthed alcoholic neighbour. Janney is over the top without getting in the way of the story or more serious aspects of the film. Her tone is right and she is terrific. AnnaSophia Robb is good in her part as Duncan's first love. The problem with her is that she is very underused and doesn't get a lot of lines. There seems to be more story to her character but not enough time to cover it. Part of the ending is that it feels like the relationship between Robb and James' story is left unfinished. Sam Rockwell is probably the highlight of the movie. He is hilarious, crass, obnoxious (in an adorable fun way) and just really a great part of the film. Rockwell really shines in this. Supporting cast including Maya Rudolph, Rob Corddry, Amanda Peet and River Alexander are all very good too. Especially River Alexander who has some hilarious scenes and lines as the young son of Janney. Their scenes together are brilliant.Faxon and Rash do directing duties too and these two guys are just incredibly talented. They have a total handle on comedy and drama and emotions and stories about life and growing up. The story and direction is quirky without being weird or going too far in the art house frame of mind. I didn't realize how well this film actually did against its modest budget and I would hope and pray that the dynamic writing and directing duo get noticed for the Oscars again next year (they previously won for The Descendants.) I can't recommend this film enough. You will laugh, you may cry, you will cheer and dance and sing and have a great time. Initially the setting for the film was meant to be the 1980's but due to budgetary constraints they modernized it. While they did leave in a few great nods to the wonderful 80's, keeping that setting might have made this a huge ten for me. There is some sort of personal connection in watching a coming of age set when you came of age. Regardless this was a home-run and I encourage anyone to check this out, certain to be a memorable film. 9/10",The Way Way Back
26,MOscarbradley,The feel-good movie of the summer,10,2 September 2013,"""The Way, Way Back"" comes from the same school as ""Stand by Me"" and ""Little Miss Sunshine"" and a lot else in-between. It's a coming-of-age movie, a summer movie and a feel-good movie and it's the movie that could finally win Allison Janney, and perhaps Sam Rockwell, an Oscar. There's nothing new here; writer/directors (and supporting players), Nat Faxon and Jim Rash, (they already have their own Oscar as co-writers of ""The Descendants""), know their material and they know their audience and they don't do anything to rock the boat but what they do, they do very well. This movie is as smart as it is likable. It has an edge to it, yes, but it never strays too far into darker territory. Simply put, it's about the summer Duncan, (a terrific, star-making performance from Liam James), spends with his mother, (Toni Collette, brilliant), and sister at the summer house of his mom's new boyfriend, (a superbly slimy Steve Carell), and naturally this is the summer he grows up, falls for the girl next door (a lovely AnnaSophia Robb), and makes a new friend and something of a surrogate father in Sam Rockwell's Water World manager. If it feels familiar and cosily predictable the quality of the writing and the acting, (Allison Janney as the broad next door, River Alexander as her sharp-tongued son), ensure that this is an unalloyed pleasure from start to finish. I loved every frame of this movie and I don't doubt for a minute that it has all the hallmarks of a future classic.",The Way Way Back
27,g-bodyl,"If You Like Little Miss Sunshine, You'll Like This!",9,14 October 2014,"Despite retreading similar ground with similar themes, The Way, Way Back is a moving, but funny dramedy which focuses on the way this one teenager grows up over the course of the summer. It's really funny how similar this movie feels to 2006's Little Miss Sunshine, ironically both starring Steve Carell and Toni Collette. Both are family and coming-of-age movies and both feature dysfunctional families. Like that film, this film relies on a likable cast and everyone does their part well.Nat Faxon and Jim Rash directs a film about an awkward 14-year-old boy named Duncan who hates this new stepfather, Trent and disappointed with his mother, Pam. He reluctantly agrees to go on a summer vacation and all is misery until he meets a water park manager named Owen who takes the boy under his wing thus giving him something to be happy about.The acting is really good. Steve Carell is usually a wacky funnyman, but he does a good job as super serious stepfather, Trent. Toni Collette does a good job as Pam. Alison Janney gets high marks in my book due to her depiction of a crazy, hippie-like neighbor and it's nice to see AnnaSophia Robb in a movie again. Sam Rockwell was excellent as the man who abides by no rules and finally, young Liam James does a pretty good job as the socially-awkward 14-year-old.Overall, The Way, Way Back has familiar themes, but the film is very enjoyable because of the great acting, the polished script, and a well-chosen soundtrack. This movie actually sort of reminded me of my summer days growing up and any movie that does that gets high marks in my book. I guess it's now time to relive those moments once again. This is a sweet, character-driven, and poignant dramedy and one of the better ones of late. I rate this film 9/10.+",The Way Way Back

29,lesleyharris30,"Sweet Movie, Albeit Lacking in Anything Special,",10,16 July 2016,"The Way Way Back is a good movie with a well developed plot and a great cast that shine in both comedic and dramatic moments. There's a melancholy atmosphere as we follow a boy at a summer home he does not want to be in at an awkward age where he does not know who he truly is yet, I certainly found Duncan relatable from my own youth. The best performances, for me, are Steve Carell and Sam Rockwell, Carell does a surprisingly great job at playing an unlikable character, while Rockwell brings in the heart, as well as a lot of laughs, giving us a very flawed, likable man. It strives to be different, it feels like it is trying too hard to uplift us, however, there are many other movies like this, awkward teen movies are common and there is not much that differentiates this from the likes of Adventureland or The Perks of Being a Wallflower, some moments felt forced as we have seen it done a million times before. Very little change happens for the main character which disappointed me, Duncan may make new friends and experiences, but when he leaves the summer home at the end he does not seem too different from the man he was at the beginning, there was not enough of a transformation, which people like to see in movies. While it is certainly formulaic, The Way Way Back is an emotional movie that is relatable and boasts a talented cast, worth the watch if you are looking for a good comedy drama, just do not go out of your way to see it.

Duncan has no self esteem and when he leaves one day he ends up at a water park where he meets Owen (Rockwell) and finds himself. This is a very very funny and touching movie that all teens with low esteem should watch. This is a very different part for Carell and he does do a great job in this. As likable as Carell is you really hate him in this movie. This is also another movie that continues the trend of the lower budget movies being much much better then the big tent-pole movies that are being released. This is kind of hard to review since the movie is really nothing more then a kid gaining confidence over a summer but it feels like so much more then that.

After getting fed-up of his Mom's boyfriend's belittling, he manages to befriend a couple of people. Betty's teenager daughter Susanna (Sophia Robb) and manager of Water Wizz, Owen. After a while of working at Water Wizz by being surrounded, by good people, Duncan begins to realize he is worthy after allThis is a fantastic coming of age film. I think what makes this movie so good is that Duncan's character is very easy to sympathize with. Many of us have had an overbearing stepfather figure that we have no choice, but to deal with. How many of you are unique souls that have been constantly been misjudged over the years? If you're one of those people, chances are you'll fall in love with Duncan. I know I certainly did. I'm socially awkward myself, finding it very difficult to be myself in public situations. It's such a change of pace from the usual blockbuster, Oscar humdrum that we have become accustomed to over the years. I love Hollywood blockbusters, even Oscar nominated stuff. I just get so tired of it sometimes, and I want to see something with heart and passion, something that will make you think. Thankfully, this is one of those movies. I don't often get watery eyes during a movie, but the finale managed to bring that out of me. The acting is excellent. Liam James shows a lot of maturity and poise for his age as Duncan. Duncan is one of the most lovable characters you will find in a movie. He's the heart and soul of this movie, and I loved him. Wait until you see his epic dancing scene while trying to retrieve cardboard from some dancers. It's epic! Steve Carrell undergoes a nasty transformation from the usual characters he plays. He is an arrogant bully and I bought it. He was very good. Toni Collette is excellent as the pitiful, yet caring mother. AnnaSophia Robb is great, but I wish she had more screen time. I wasn't a fan of how they wrote the relationship between her and Liam James. That's my only criticism of this movie. Sam Rockwell is utterly lovable as Owen. I'm not into him as many others are, but he stole every scene he was in. I thought he was wonderful. Janney, Coddry, Peet, and Rudolph do what they have to do well. OverallThis movie doesn't get enough recognition as far as i'm concerned. It's one of those gems that keep you thinking for a while after it's over. If you don't smile at some juncture during this movie, get help. It's a must see in my opinion. I'm a Canadian, but I now have to do something before I kick the bucket.

And this kid...no, this is not a normal shy, withdrawn kid. Time for electric shock treatments here! Or is Liam James just such a ""passive"" actor? This is way beyond how any normal kid behaves.To be honest, my guess is that that issue is the fault of directors Nat Faxon and Jim Rash. There are several rather immature directorial flaws here. In addition to a lack of subtlety in the kid's withdrawn-ness (yes, I know that's not a word) (the kid even lopes along stoop-shouldered to emphasize his fragile state), we know that potential stepdad Steve Carell must be a not-so-good guy because he remains unshaven for the entire film.Don't get me wrong. The story is decent, though far from unique among the coming-of-age genre films. And some of the acting is pretty good. Although Steve Carell is the unlikable character here, it was nice to see him in a more dramatic role. Toni Collette is a mess...but she's supposed to be here as the mother who has linked up with a not so noble boyfriend after her previous marriage crumbled. I've always enjoyed Allison Janney, and her role here as a slightly loopy neighbor and mother gave her a chance to stretch from the roles we usually see her in. AnnaSophia Robb does nicely as the almost love interest of the boy. But, if the film belongs to anyone, it's actor Sam Rockwell. I was first and most impressed with Rockwell in ""The Green Mile"", and while not all his roles are big, each is finely tuned.So, the story is okay, if not infused with subtlety. Overall, the acting is pretty good. It's a decent film. But I wouldn't be at all tempted to watch it a second time!",The Way Way Back

It was like the boy version of Hilary Duff's 'According to Greta', had all the elements like separated parents, struggling teenager, cheating husband and the summer holiday and job. The story was told from the character Duncan who is trying hard to fit in his new family.'The Way, Way Back' tells the story of a 14 year-old Duncan who goes to a beach house in a small town for the summer vacation with his mother and her new boyfriend. Duncan was not happy and so his step father who talks tough with him. The vacation is the chance to understand each other but it won't go according to their plan. Each of them find their way of happiness, sometimes it ends in disappointment with others. Whether their bond strengthens or not is where the movie concludes with the simple ending.Emotionally the movie had the upper hand than what they have called it as a dark comedy.

36,zkonedog,"This Movie Has Something, But It Just Isn't Focused Enough",5,1 September 2017,"""The Way Way Back"" isn't a horrible movie. It isn't nearly a classic, either. What puts it firmly in the middle ground is how the film teases with what looks to be an interesting premise, but then can't decide what it wants to be.For a basic plot summary, this movie tells the story of Duncan (Liam James), who is spending the summer with his mother (Toni Collette) and her new boyfriend (Steve Carell). While his mother can't see that her new beau may not be right for her, Duncan picks up on it right away, and as a result wants to spend as little time as possible ""hanging around"". As such, his summer is spent working under the mentorship of Owen (Sam Rockwell) at the local waterpark, as well as puzzling over the mysterious and beautiful neighbor girl Susanna (AnnaSophia Robb).As I said in the opening, I think that the main problem with ""The Way Way Back"" is that directors Nat Faxon & Jim Rash just can't decide what they want this movie to feel like. On one hand, it tries to be a ""teen screwball coming-of-age"" movie (especially with all the waterpark stuff), but that is the weakest material. On the other hand, it could have been more of a serious drama, but that tone isn't present whatsoever (until perhaps the very end, when it clearly becomes obvious that it was not earned by any meaningful character development). Instead, ""Way Way Back"" just sort of lands in the middle.For this movie to have really shined, I think a couple of things would have had to happen (besides the obvious settling on a tone):-We would need more development within Duncan's new family, which the ""screwball"" sections of the film really crowd out. Largely, the movie relies on stereotypes or well-worn character paths (overbearing stepfather, Mother too swept away to notice, etc.) to build drama, so it is no wonder that it falls a bit flat in the end.-Robb's character is severely underutilized. She spends nearly the entire movie in various bikinis (so it is pretty obvious what her purpose was), but once again her character's presence doesn't add up to much in the end. When she gives Duncan a kiss, it doesn't feel ""earned"" at all based on what we've seen previously (all awkward conversations and scenarios). Susanna could have been a ""sexual awakening"" character for Duncan, or she could of been a confident of sorts (her family is going through divorce issues as well). I never really felt the character lived up to either billing.So, while ""The Way Way Back"" is a perfectly acceptable fun summer movie, I can't give it any higher than middle-of-the-road marks because of the odd tone and waffling genres. To me, it needed to ""pick a lane"" (coming-of-age drama or screwball teen goof-off) and stay within it, as the melding of the two yielded rather odd results.",The Way Way Back
37,eddie_baggins,One of 2013's most enjoyable films,8,3 December 2013,"Thanks to some fun spirited supporting turns and an easy going charm The Descendants writing duo of Nat Faxon and Jim Rash's coming of age dramedy The Way Way Back is one of this year's most enjoyable and lovable films and one that will make you want to find the nearest water park.Despite The Way Way Back not being particularly original by any stretch of the imagination, there is a freshness and sincerity to Faxon and Rash's script that allows actors such as the ever great Sam Rockwell as charming man-child Owen and Alison Janney as the not so charming divorce' Betty to truly shine in roles that are some of the year's best written and best performed. I think it's needful to make a more particular mention of Rockwell's performance in this film, a performance that reaffirms that Rockwell is one of the most professional actors working today and as his memorable roles continue to build he is quickly establishing himself as one of the most fully formed character actors to have worked in the industry. In concerns to the other performers in the film, Carell as an against type arrogant pig does well to subvert his usual characteristics and Collette is as solid as ever.The Way Way Back's major stumbling block is strangely Liam James as our 14 year old protagonist Duncan. Jame's role was perhaps played to perfection but his sulky introverted teenager isn't exactly a barrel of laughs to be around and in some scenes it feels like his in need of a good old fashioned shake up and a reminder that your life is not that bad. The film also has some other elements that whilst fun seem slightly forced, such as Duncan's ""Pop and Lock"" impromptu dance off at the water park or Jim Rash's appearances as creepy park employee Lewis. Overall though these slight missteps can't diminish the films many qualities in any significant movie ruining manner.It's refreshing to watch a movie that is a pure unbridled joy to sit back to and watch. The teenager inside all of us can relate to many an anguish or awkward moment that appears throughout the film and there are many stand out comedic moments delivered by the white hot performance of Rockwell. In a year filled with many a bloated and misguided tale The Way Way Back is like one of those good water slides that you'll want to race back to again and again.4 Candy Land's out of 5 For more movie reviews and opinions check out -www.jordanandeddie.wordpress.com",The Way Way Back
38,leonblackwood,Waste of a great cast! 3/10,3,1 March 2014,"Review: This movie took some time to watch because I kept on falling asleep, due to its slow pace and the fact that I lost interest. The cast looked amazing, but the movie is primarily based around one kid who is on holiday with his mum, played by Toni Colette, and her cheating boyfriend, played by Steve Carell. Not only does the boy find a girlfriend, he also gets a job and finds a friend in Sam Rockwell. Personally, I just found the film to be quite dull and the leading character wasn't the best choice by the director. All the way through the film I was waiting for something exciting to happen, but it stays on the same time throughout the movie. Even the ending was disappointing because there isn't a moral to the story. Anyway, it's a total waste of a great cast.Round-Up: I enjoy watching Sam Rockwell in all of his movies, but he just seems to pick the wrong ones to star in. His quirky acting style is very unique, and it really worked in movies like Iron Man 2 and Moon, but you can tell that the director is holding him back. Steve Carell didn't really play a major part in this movie, but it's weird to watch him not pulling funny faces and doing weird expressions like he usually does in his movies. As for the other rest of the cast, they all put in average performances but that is due to the script being based on the kid. I didn't really find the concept that interesting or anything out of the norm, which is why I struggled to focus on what was going on.Budget: N/A Worldwide Gross: $23.2millionI recommend this movie to people who are into there comedy/dramas about a boy who goes away with his mum and her boyfriend on his summer vacation. 3/10",The Way Way Back
39,howard.schumann,Really hit home for me,9,4 August 2013,"""Before you know kindness as the deepest thing inside, you must know sorrow as the other deepest thing""- Naomi Shihab Nye Directed and co-written by Nat Faxon and Jim Rash who won an Oscar for the Best Adapted Screenplay for The Descendants, The Way Way Back is a warmhearted and beautifully realized teen comedy that is as poignant as it is funny. Though there are more coming-of-age films than references to God in the Bible, very few have really hit home for me as much as this one. Of course, there are the usual complaints from critics about how it ""doesn't break any new ground"" as if it was a construction site, but to me it felt fresh and alive with real and relatable characters far removed from the stereotypes of most films in this genre.In the film, 14-year-old Duncan (Liam James) is a sullen, withdrawn adolescent whose shaky self-image is not helped by his divorced mother Pam's (Toni Collette) and her obnoxious boyfriend Trent (Steve Carell), or his snippy daughter Steph (Zoe Levin). On the drive to spend the summer at Trent's beach house called ""The Riptide,"" Trent asks him how he would rate himself on a scale of one to ten. Not normally being asked to rate oneself, Duncan might have said ""two thumbs up,"" if he thought about it, but all he can think of to say is a six.When Trent tells him (calling him Buddy as he does throughout the film as if he has no name) that he thinks he is a three because he doesn't put himself out to people, he might think he is showing some tough love, but the result is that Duncan is pushed deeper into his shell. As Albert Einstein said, ""Only two things are infinite, the universe and human stupidity, and I'm not sure about the former."" At the New England beach house as his mother tries to make everyone happy, Duncan has to deal with adults whose maturity level on a scale of one to ten might be so low as to be off the charts. There is the boozy and off-the-wall neighbor Betty (Allison Janney) as well as Trent's friends Kip and Joan (Robb Corddry and Amanda Peet), all engaging in what Betty calls ""Spring break for adults."" To make matters more uncomfortable, Betty's daughter Susanna (AnnaSophia Robb), who is slightly older than Duncan, tries to engage him in conversation but the stoop-shouldered boy is too withdrawn to respond. He is more at ease with Betty's younger son Peter (River Alexander) who is constantly being teased about his unfocused left eye. On one of his frequent bike rides on the pink bike he discovers in the garage, however, Duncan finds a kindred spirit at the Wizz World Water Park in the person of Owen (Sam Rockwell), the park's manager. As are-free and ungrounded as some of the other adults in the film, Owen has one attribute the others lack. He has a terrific sense of humor and takes an interest in the people around him.These include long-time employee Maya Rudolph (Caitlyn) who had only planned to stay one summer but is drawn back by Owen's charm and wit. Owen also takes an interest in Duncan but it is not the ""brother you need help"" attitude. He gives him a job at the park's pools and water slides to help boost his self-esteem, a job which neither Trent nor his mother know anything about. Sam Rockwell's performance as Owen is pitch-perfect. Even though his communication with Duncan is mostly full of wisecracks, there is an underlying connection between the two that is not based on need alone. Pure and simple, they like each other and it shows, as does the remarkable chemistry displayed by the entire ensemble cast.Duncan's transformation happens gradually, however. As he finds himself being accepted by the park's employees, his shoulders begin to straighten out, there is a hint of a smile on his face as well as a new look of confidence. Lian James, a Vancouver actor, not only disappears into the role of Duncan, he is Duncan and his struggle to reconnect with the world he has been estranged from is so honest and painful that we identify with him and want to help him, in Langston Hughes words, ""to break his shadow into a thousand lights of sun."" As in many great films, The Way Way Back has laughter and tears in equal measure.",The Way Way Back

41,Movie_Muse_Reviews,Perfectly captures the magic and the reality of growing up during the summer,9,12 December 2013,"Summertime — there's no season more influential in a young person's coming of age. Being out of school means a chance for a new experiences and self-discovery, and spending that time in a new location always feels like a fresh start. In ""The Way Way Back,"" Nat Faxon and Jim Rash (""The Descendants"") portray the ""life-changing summer"" in a sincere way, but they also capture the nostalgia and fairy tale-like qualities with which we often remember these times in our lives.It starts and ends with Duncan (Liam James). Too many characters in independent films are written like Duncan, the socially challenged kid who discovers himself with the help of some quirky role models and a beautiful girl, but James actually looks and acts the part, compared to the many protagonists we usually see in these films. He's quiet, closed off and doesn't stick up for himself, but he's more than the product of a the unlikable supporting characters jerking him around and most importantly, James is actually close to the same age as Duncan (a 16-year-old playing a 14-year-old), which so many coming-of-age characters aren't.Duncan is going for a long summer vacation to the Massachusetts shore with his mom (Toni Collette) and her serious boyfriend (Steve Carell), Trent, who tries to impose rules on him while taking shots at his self-confidence. Along with Trent's superficial and self-absorbed daughter, Steph (Zoe Levin), they stay at Trent's beach house, which clearly is meant to be a getaway for Trent and Duncan's mom, who spend their days and nights there drinking and socializing with Trent's neighbors (Allison Janney, Amanda Peet and Rob Corddry). Clearly miserable, Duncan endeavors to get away, and in doing so discovers Water Wizz water park and its carefree owner/operator, Owen (Sam Rockwell).Water Wizz is like an entirely different world, a Neverland of sorts where growing up doesn't require growing pains, where life's unfairness doesn't apply; a place where Duncan can find himself in the middle of a break dancing circle and earn the nickname ""Pop-'n-Lock."" There's a huge difference between the way the script treats scenes at the beach house, where Duncan can't be himself, and scenes at the water park. Rockwell's Owen is by no means a paragon of self-made success, but there's something about his attitude toward life and that of the other park employees played by Maya Rudolph, Rash and Faxon that's infectious.The family drama away from Duncan's chlorinated safe haven, on the other hand, can get heavy and real. It is full of unhappy characters trying to force themselves into happiness and being inauthentic with themselves and each other. That's why Duncan can't stand it, especially when it becomes clear that Trent and his mother don't have the healthiest of relationships. As the story unfolds, the divide between Duncan's worlds grows so large that he can't straddle them any longer.And what would this story be without a little romance? Janney's Betty, who lives next to Trent's beach house, has a teenage daughter named Susanna (AnnaSophia Robb) who takes a curious shining to Duncan, presumably because her friends, which include Trent's daughter Steph, are also superficial. Of course Susanna is the kind of knockout that guys like Duncan dream about landing but rarely do, so their relationship is part of that nostalgic coming-of- age fantasy. Faxon and Rash clearly aren't aiming for 100 percent realism, just 100 percent genuineness of emotion. Something about ""The Way Way Back"" so easily provokes the fond recollection of summers past. It taps into the feelings, emotions and nerve endings of those formative experiences and the role models that profoundly impact our lives. It has to be the honest, reflective writing and the telling of a story that has a lot of universal touch-points and therefore really resonates.Casting actors who have perfected the dance between drama and comedy proves immensely important as well. Carell, Collette, Janney (practically a poster woman for independent comedy), Rockwell — they know how to operate in these stories and they know how to make humorous dialogue feel true to their characters. The script pushes for humor in spots, so talents like these help keep everything real.Everyone should be able to find some kind of connection to ""The Way Way Back,"" and that will keep it from getting lost in coming-of-age indie comedy obscurity. Faxon and Rash are two- for-two and whatever they've got in store next has to be considered a must-watch.~Steven CThanks for reading! Visit moviemusereviews.com for more",The Way Way Back
42,BeneCumb,Pleasant comedy with sad undertones,8,24 October 2013,"I had not heard about the movie but I was sure that participants like Steve Carell, Toni Collette, Sam Rockwell would definitely provide above-average performances as they do not accept random roles. But right after the beginning, I became pleasantly surprised and all this lasted till the very end which was wittily versatile, not syrupy as most US comedies tend to have.The Way Way Back is definitely a comedy - thanks particularly to Allison Janney as Betty and Sam Rockwell as Owen whose joking and approaches nicely go beyond ""arid decency"" - but as there are several broken families with teen children in the background, quarrels and tender moments are easy to appear. And in the event of poor relations or lies, children are usually the ones who suffer most... Luckily, Duncan (pleasantly performed by Liam James) found the place where he could open himself and be appreciated, not everyone has such kind an opportunity in a new environment.In spite of some ""adult"" jokes and language, the movie is recommended to all families with schoolchildren, especially if the family ties or relations with neighbors are fragile. Movies provided for Sundance Film Festival have given lots of memorable moments, long live that festival!",The Way Way Back
43,PWNYCNY,"Strong story dealing with the nature of interpersonal relationships,",9,15 July 2013,"Although Steve Carell gets top billing in this movie, Sam Rockwell has the principal role and it's his movie. Carell plays an uncharacteristically morbid role of Trent, an emotionally abusive man who is cheating on his girlfriend, Pam (played by Toni Colette), an emotionally vulnerable divorced woman with a teenage son, Duncan, a quiet and introverted boy played by Liam James. While on their way to a summer sea side resort in Massachusetts, conflict between Trent and Duncan quickly becomes apparent, with the mother caught in the middle, not knowing what to do. The situation gets worse after they arrive at Trent's summer home, where Trent's spoiled teenage daughter is staying. Feeling rejected and unwanted Duncan grabs a bicycle and rides into town where he meets Owen, played by Sam Rockwell, the manager of the local amusement park who befriends Duncan and, unbeknownst to Trent and Pam, gives Duncan a job at the park. Soon Duncan is spending all his time at the amusement park where he emerges from his emotional cocoon, revealing a warm and engaging personality. Owen soon becomes a surrogate father-figure for Duncan. Meanwhile, the relationship between Trent and Pam falls apart as it becomes obvious that Trent is cheating with another woman. At a party, Duncan demands that Pam confront the situation; during this discussion Trent and Duncan almost get into a fight. Trent tells Duncan that his father does not want him. The next day, Trent and Pam decide to leave early; while in the car driving through the town, Duncan suddenly leaves the car, runs to the amusement park and says good by to Owen and the rest of the staff. Trent and Pam soon follow, wanting to know what's going on. Soon Trent demands that they leave and goes to fetch Duncan but Owen steps in front of Duncan. Trent returns to the car; the final scene finds Duncan in the back seat where he is joined by his mother, leaving Trent alone. This is a strong story, with excellent acting and dramatizes a number of themes revolving around the nature of familial and interpersonal relationships.",The Way Way Back
44,tadpole-596-918256,Of the seven movies I've seen this summer featuring swim pool lifeguards . . .,10,24 September 2013,". . . as cast members, THE WAY WAY BACK is by far the best. EVERYBODY would want to vacation at Water Whizz, as long as they knew Owen (played by Sam Rockwell) would be on duty as manager. Owen is a regular stand-up, splash-down comedy act, always ready with the sharp tongue for those who deserve it, as well as a heart of gold for the needier visitors or underlings at the Whizz. Like the WIZARD OF OZ, Owen can pull something out of his black bag of tricks at a moment's notice to deal with any crisis of the heart or psyche. Liam James as 14-year-old Duncan, Owen's number one reclamation project during the summer in which this story takes place, is the perfect picture of tough vulnerability; a walking ""stiff upper lip"" made of porcelain, ready to crack at any instant without warning. Owen singles Duncan out for ""manning up"" lessons, turning him from the weak link on his mom's key chain into an independent human being with a viable future. With an 103-minute running time, THE WAY WAY BACK does not make the mistake of wearing out its welcome, like most of its competition in the Life Guard Follies filling the multiplexes and direct-to-video shelves this season.

45,meeza,Way Way to the top of my list as one of the best movies of 2013!,10,24 July 2013,"I have to go way way back in thinking of a coming-of-age summer comedic movie that made me feel so good, and in doing that the classic ""Meatballs"" comes to mind. The dynamic duo team of Nat Faxon & Jim Rash have swimmingly perfected a film that homages ""Meatballs"" and puts a new spin to it, without duplicating it; and that would be in their craft filmmaking of ""The Way Way Back"". The film stars teen actor Liam James as 14 year-old Duncan who is an isolated teen who despises the idea of taking a summer vacation with his timid mother Pam, her arrogant boyfriend Trent, and Trent's narcissistic daughter Steph. Their vacation spot is at Trent's beach house where nearby has a water park; I will slide into that one a little later in my review. Trent does have a few eccentric neighbors in his beach house which include the lush-filled gabby Betty, a divorcée with three kids; and also the vociferous couple Kip & Joan. Duncan is constantly ridiculed and excluded by Trent and Stephanie which puts him in the perpetual state of ""I want to get the f*ck of out of here"". However, in a twist of fate, Duncan befriends the vivacious water park employee Owen, perfectly played by Sam Rockwell. Consequently, Duncan starts to regularly visit the water park to hang with Owen and the other water park wacky employees. And before you know it, Duncan plummets himself to a part-time working gig at the park; unknowing to his mom and Trent. Duncan takes flight at the water park and you see the ""coming-of-age"" turn at every moment in his time there. Owen's character is very reminiscent of the Tripper character (played to the tee by Bill Murray) in ""Meatballs"". But Rockwell plays the part so superbly that it does not appear to be a Tripper duplication but instead a modern transformation within its Tripper homage; tripped out yet? Duncan also befriends Betty's teen daughter Susanna, who empathizes with Duncan's situation in dealing with a callous potential stepdaddy. Faxon & Rash's masterful direction & screenplay of ""The Way Way Back"" was not dead on the water; in fact- the vitality, humor, and tenderness they brought to the movie's direction & screenplay should hopefully land them in the wave of Oscar contenders for Best Director & Best Original Screenplay. As far as the thespian pool of the picture, I must state that it was a perfect ensemble. James showed potentiality that he will be on his way back to other leading roles with his fine work as Duncan. Steve Carell's performance as Trent showed the depth to his acting by playing a part non-typical to the Carell filmography; Trent was sure one heartless bastard, and Carell disappeared into the role. Toni Collette was spic & spam in her role as Duncan's mom Pam. Faxon & Rash themselves were a hoot playing two water park employees, Roddy and Lewis. Other supporting turns that were no lazy river works were of Anna Sophia Robb as Susanna, Rob Corddry & Amanda Peet who we had fun with as Kip & Joan, and Maya Rudolph as water park manager Caitlin; and I would be remiss if I did not mention the standout, scene-stealing performance from Allison Janney as the wickedly-hilarious Betty. Be it as it may, it was still Rockwell that stole the show here. His work in ""The Way Way Back"" should slide him into a Best Supporting Actor Oscar nomination. ""The Way Way Back"" is a gem of a movie, and I hope it does not land ""way way back"" in your ""movies to see"" list; if for no better reason, you will be delaying time in missing one heck of a flick. ***** Excellent",The Way Way Back
46,drqshadow-reviews,"Earnest, Relateable and Endearing - We've All Been Here Before",8,5 November 2013,"A sweet, funny, earnest coming-of-age dramedy that plays out like a period piece, even though it's set in the present day. Tempering a plucky spirit and subtle, pointed sense of humor with an introverted lead character and a familiar, bittersweet atmosphere, it's a spiritual successor to the John Hughes golden age of the mid-80s. Liam James is beautifully awkward as the quiet, brooding young teenager at the story's epicenter, aided by a thoroughly deep, entertaining supporting cast. No matter how minor, every character enjoys a purpose and a motivation, enriching the scenery and tickling the viewer's curiosity with a tangle of warm, colorful subplots. Steve Carell will get plenty of attention in his unexpected turn as the boy's self-centered douchebag stand-in father, but Sam Rockwell's deeper-than-he-seems burnout splash park manager is the real show stealer.

47,estebangonzalez10,2013 is the year for coming-of-age films,8,16 October 2013,"""Duncan! On a scale of 1 to 10, what do you think you are?""It's been a great year for people like me who love coming-of-age films. So far I haven't been disappointed. Mud is my favorite film of the year, The Kings of Summer was a lot of fun, and The Way Way Back was charming. I loved this film despite it pretty much following the same formula most of these coming-of-age films do. The thing that stood out for me here were the performances and the emotion involving script written by Academy Award winning screenwriters Nat Faxon and Jim Rash (The Descendants). I was engaged with the story from the very opening scene and cared deeply for these characters. There were a perfect mix of funny and entertaining moments with some emotional drama. Liam James delivers a strong lead performance although at times he overdoes the physical aspect a bit by shrugging his shoulders a little too much (especially during the first half of the film until he begins building his confidence). It felt like he was trying too hard to point out that he was shy and lost, but I still sympathized with his character. The true stars of this film however are the secondary characters. Sam Rockwell gives yet another spectacular performance and he owns this movie. It was a pleasure to see his character on screen and he had great chemistry with Liam as he helped the kid grow and became a sort of a father figure to him. Steve Carell hits all the right notes in this film as the douche bag without overselling the performance. No matter how much you may love him as an actor, he genuinely is despiteful in this movie. Allison Janney is also hilarious in this movie. For a coming of age film I thought the adult actors were much better than the kids (at least their characters were better developed), and the location truly felt like a Spring Break for adults. Faxon and Rash not only wrote the script, they also played secondary characters (they were also really funny), and this was their first film as directors. I really liked this movie and thought it was even better than Payne's The Descendants which they helped write. The Way Way Back gets my respects and I definitely recommend this movie.Fourteen year old Duncan (Liam James) is a shy and lonely kid who is being forced by his mom, Pam (Toni Collette) to travel with her to her boyfriend's beach house for the summer. She has been dating Trent (Steve Carrell) for over a year now and they decide to travel together along with his daughter, Steph (Zoe Levin). Once they arrive to their destiny they are welcomed by Trent's single sister, Betty (Allison Janney) and her two kids: Susanna (AnnaSophia Robb) and Peter (River Alexander). Duncan has a difficult time talking to anyone and would have preferred going to his father's house in California (especially since Trent treats him so badly). At this unexpected place he begins to find himself when he accepts a summer job at a water park managed by the goofy Owen (Sam Rockwell). Owen takes a liking for the shy kid and teaches him a few life lessons. He also befriends the rest of the employees of the park including Caitlin (Maya Rudolph), Roddy (Nat Faxon), and Lewis (Jim Rash). He tries to spend as much time as he can in the water park, since back home the only person he can actually talk to is Susanna with whom a nice friendship slowly begins to form. Rob Corddry and Amanda Peet also star in this film as Trent's friends with whom they spend most of the time.The Way Way Back has some similarities to Adventureland and although that film might be a little better I still think The Way Way Back holds its own mainly because of how great Sam Rockwell is here. It was easy for me to identify with Duncan and the film builds on that nostalgic sentiment of adolescence at times. Some elements may seem familiar or taken from other movies, but they still work in a unique way here. I really wouldn't mind watching this film again because it was a pleasant experience. It's like a summer destiny I would like to visit again the following summer. I loved how they managed to turn so many familiar elements from the genre and make them feel fresh and new. There are moments where you will find yourself laughing hard and then the next minute you will feel heart broken. I also loved the soundtrack for this film. The Way Way Back is a very enjoyable film, especially if coming-of-age films are you sort of thing.",The Way Way Back
48,Fluke_Skywalker,Summertime blues,7,12 January 2015,"The ""dramedy"" is one of the trickiest of all film genres, and if you don't get the ratio and tone just right, the two elements (drama and comedy) begin to work at cross-purposes and undermine the entire thing. In the case of 'The Way, Way Back', there are a number of elements that probably shouldn't work when blended together, yet they do. Much of the credit should be given to the cast, particularly the perpetually underrated and under-appreciated Sam Rockwell. His character often seems like he just walked in from a completely different film, and yet somehow his otherwise disparate performance is one of the things that ultimately glues the whole thing together.Though it's packed-to-bursting with clichés, 'The Way, Way Back' still manages to charm and then sneak up on you emotionally by the end.",The Way Way Back

50,juneebuggy,Likable coming of age flick filled with great performances,6,30 January 2016,"This was a likable enough coming of age dramedy. I didn't know anything about it going in but based on the cast attached I figured it was worth a watch. The story follows an introverted teen named Duncan who is forced to go to his mothers boyfriends beach house for the summer. Toni Collette plays the Mom here, a weak sort of character and Steve Carell is the (surprisingly) a$$hole boyfriend -just a horrible person. Anyways, while the parents party the summer away with (Allison Janney, Amanda Peet & Rob Corddry) awkward Duncan makes friends with (Sam Rockwell) and stumbles into a job at a local water park where he sort of comes into his own.There wasn't anything really new here in terms of a ground-breaking story and it felt uneven as a whole because while parts of the story were very much on the drama end of things other story lines went into the corny side of funny. I definitely felt Duncan's pain though, as he's stuck in this place with these horrible people.One aspect that I found a bit weird was that the kids in this beach resort town are basically allowed to run amuck while the parents behave like its spring break for adults, getting drunk and partying all day and night, doing drugs on a daily basis. Duncan actually works his full time job at the water park without his mom noticing.All in an average sort of movie, likable enough and filled with great performances. 1/3/16",The Way Way Back
51,aharmas,This Movie Has A Huge Heart!!!,10,29 July 2013,"It has been decades since I have such a wonderful film. Telling the story of a young man who finds direction in what could have been the worst Summer of his life, ""The Way Way Back"" looks directly into the hearts of its protagonist and ours, making us realize that human beings are mostly flawed and scared to face what is right in front of them. Duncan's life gives him very little reason to smile about. His mother's latest boyfriend is a condescending and demeaning human being who confuses discipline with abuse. With a selfish nature, he drags Duncan and his mother to spend Summer in a resort town. It sounds like a great way to get to bond with his new family, but his approach certainly makes Duncan believe he's walking straight into hell.He needs a way to escape this horrible situation and being shy and socially inept doesn't help. Older children make fun of him and put him down. He's too old to hang around the younger neighbors' kids. Luckyly he finds his way to the Water park, and through Owen, an amazing and quirky character (Sam Rockwell), he discovers there is much more to life and himself.As Duncan slowly blooms into a happier and more self-assured young man, he grows up and shows the other people around him that it's not good to keep everything bottled in. It is time to choose and live, to move forward in order to survive and make the best of life. In the park he is able to show Owen and others he's resourceful, charismatic and a good person. This is a more difficult situation at home, and eventually crisis hits, allowing change to finally occur.The performances are sensational from the leading characters to everyone in a supporting role. Every move, word, sigh, and reaction has been carefully written into a script that is as touching and funny as ""Little Miss Sunshine"" and a few other comedies that are not afraid to explore love, loneliness, and friendship.It is great to see in a Summer of lack of creativity and too much dependence on tired material and repetition, a film that in spite of dealing with familiar themes, feeling fresh, invigorating, and powerful. It inspires us to believe there is still room for hope and improvement in this world. I loved how technology and modern obsessions are almost non existent here. People have fun in gatherings, playing board games, talking to each other, doing physical activities and going out in the sun. As Duncan develops his healthy natural tan, so our spirits grow because we have an opportunity to feel his joy and the prospects that everything is going to be o.k.",The Way Way Back
52,Amari-Sali,A Coming of Age tale with more heart than you expected,9,6 July 2013,"Being that I'm a fan of AnnaSophia Robb, I felt compelled to see this film. Luckily though, she isn't the only recognizable name in the cast. There is Steve Carell, Toni Collette, Allison Janney, Sam Rockwell, Maya Rudolph, Amanda Peet, and Jim Rash (Community). Also there is the familiar face of Rob Corddry who I last saw in the movie Warm Bodies as Marcus. All together, the cast was really wonderful to watch and the lead Liam James was wonderfully awkward to the point that it felt like he would have been a much better choice for Charlie in Perks of Being a Wallflower than Logan Lerman.Breaking down the characters: Collette plays James' mom Pam who seemingly is in a relationship more to avoid being alone, than out of love. What doesn't help is Carell's Trent is a butt head on multiple levels. Luckily for Duncan (played by Liam James) there is Robb's Susanna who Robb plays in her own sort of unique version of a love interest. She isn't pining over the lead, nor is she playing games with Duncan. Robb makes this traditional role for women not seem like it was written in some lonely, often rejected, man's head, but like someone who may have actually been friends with a girl/woman in their lifetime. As for everyone else, Janney's Betty is a comic relief alcoholic and Rockwell's Owen is a comic relief as well, but he also really brings the heart of the story and helps Duncan regain the confidence Trent has chipped away at.Now, when it comes to the movie, the ensemble cast really make the story shine. Duncan is your everyday weird kid, like the one who went to your school which seemingly lived a life just trying to get through school without getting beat up or noticed. He is forced to go with his mom and her boyfriend to his beach house with his, Trent's, daughter Stef from his last marriage. During the ride, as seen in the trailer, we establish that Trent is a butt head and he picks with Duncan on a semi-constant basis. Upon arrival to the beach house we meet Betty and Susanna, and then Peter later on. Seemingly Stef and Susanna have some type of friendship, or did, and Duncan has a slight crush on her. Oh, and let me add Stef isn't fond of Duncan, but not as mean as her dad. From there the story goes with Duncan wandering the town just to stay out of the house and not be forced to be around his mom and Trent, much less deal with Trent constantly looking for ways to embarrass him. So, this leads to him meeting Owen and eventually working with Owen at Water Wizz. Duncan working there brings a turnaround in his life for Owen, though very sarcastic, is really the only person in the movie for quite some time which treats Duncan like a person, and not a dog which can't control its bowels. Of course though, Duncan's happiness can't last forever, so even after becoming more confidant, and even getting to spend time with Susanna and getting to know her, his time at the beach house comes to an end, and Trent and his mom are the reason for the shortened vacation. Thankfully though, the movie ends with a sweet goodbye from Susanna and a nice moment with Owen.With this movie, I felt that I was watching a genuine story or, at the very least, a well thought out one. Duncan's character is easily relatable and watching him drag himself through life in the hopes of finding where he belongs and finding someone who would accept him is sometimes hard to watch, but satisfying when you see him find Owen and join Owen's sort of family. Also, between Betty and Owen, they help keep the story from being downright depressing once the drama kicks in, and their roles in the film help from the movie seemingly becoming the final days before Duncan committed suicide.Which leads to a slight issue of the movie: Though 103 minutes, it at times feels long. I mostly attribute this to watching Duncan mope around which though valuable to the story, starts to bring you down a bit, and maybe remind you of the less happier times in your own life. But besides that, I didn't feel like there were any real issues a person could have with the movie.Overall: Go See ItFor me, it is hard to find movies which really seek to give a genuine portrayal of what it can be like to be a teenager. I loved that Liam James wasn't a pretty boy type, but average looking, and though he did sort of mope through the movie, you never really felt like it wasn't unwarranted. Also, the writers never let it get so bad for Duncan that you ended up wanting to roll your eyes, for either things got better or Betty/ Owen lightened things up. Which is also something worth mentioning. Everyone in the film seems like a real person no matter how over the top they may sometimes act. Though Duncan is the most obvious, everyone seems to be going through something and coping the best they can and though some are using better means than others, you can see by the end of the movie that everyone is at least making some type of effort to get back to the time when they were happy. Maybe that is why it is called The Way, Way Back? Everyone is trying to get to that long ago time when they were actually happy people.",The Way Way Back
53,jadepietro,The Right Way,9,11 August 2013,"This film is highly recommended.The Way, Way Back is a film that celebrates life and all of its obstacles in an insightful and refreshing way. Duncan (Liam James) is that typically gawky alienated teenager, a lonely and only child and a product of a divorced home. His mother, Pam (Toni Collette), is now involved with a narcissistic lout named Trent (Steve Carell), who constantly torments Duncan with his sage and demeaning advice. A trip to Trent's summer beach house can only be a harbinger of trouble for Duncan. It is there that he meets Betty (Allison Janney), the drunken next door neighbor and her hot daughter, Susanna (AnnaSophia Robb). Also on hand are Kip and Joan (Rob Corddry and Amanda Peet), two of Trent's friends. While there does seem to be an overabundance of quirky characters in this small town community, their eccentricities do grow a bit cloying at times. It all becomes too much to bear for Duncan who escapes to his I-pod or takes a trip to a nearby water park where he meets more eccentrics like Caitlin (Maya Rudolph), the loyal girlfriend of Owen (Sam Rockwell), the park owner and glib philosopher who befriends Duncan. All these characters set in motion events that will teach Duncan some life lessons which will change his aimless direction.The literate screenplay offers so many clever lines and develops strong and caring characters. Written by the talented team of Nat Faxon and Jim Rash, who also play Water Whiz Park employees, Roddy, a lecherous beach boy, and Lewis, a self-pitying nerd, respectively. The Way, Way Back is a small independent film that charms and entertains remarkably well. Solidly directed by Faxon and Rash, the film successfully blends the elements of comedy and drama into a cohesive coming-of-age tale. Much of the film's merits are due to the assembled actors who are just terrific in their roles. James is a revelation as Duncan. He conveys anger, frustration, and awe with such nuance, creating a flawed but sensitive character, a modern day Benjamin Braddock. Carell has the unsympathetic role of Trent and the actor is not afraid to make him into a weak and self- centered monster. It's a brave and unsafe performance that works. Collette is such a consummate actress as Pam. Her subtle expressions and body language gives her emotional role a deeper meaning. Sam Rockwell as Owen takes his complicated man-child in interesting and understated directions and provides much of the film's humorous quips. There is continued strong support by Rudolph, Robb, and especially Janney, who steals every one of her scenes as the neighborhood gossip and lush.The Way, Way Back is a thorough delight, from start to finish. The film never meanders or loses its way. It stays the course and allows its rich interplay of characters to leisurely unfold and exist in its make believe world, a world that helps Duncan and others finally find their way home.

54,p-stepien,Beach woes and water relief,7,13 October 2013,"If US movies are to be believed, every summer American families en masse venture to the beach houses of the Hampdens, the swarming sea fronts often offering opportunities to enhance and highlight frictions within the dysfunctional households themselves. In the American reality of widespread broken family entities, most of the characters on show function in divorced fractured cells. Within one of these lives Duncan (Liam James), a reclusive youth struggling to find a connection with his peers, while accompanying his mother Pam (Toni Collette) and her rigid, at times bullish, boyfriend Trent (Steve Carell) to a small beach-front summer house. Surrounded by juvenile adults, Pam immerses into the blissful holiday atmosphere, leaving Duncan to fend for himself, causing him to be increasingly distanced and repulsed by the situation.He soon finds himself intrigued by the aptly named Water Wizzdom, where he quickly befriends Owen (Sam Rockwell), a charming wisecracking sluggard who runs the water park at minimum exertion. The two quickly form an awkward bond, as Duncan soon becomes an employ at the facility, finally finding joy on this otherwise hellish vacation. Growing in confidence and stature as the days go by, he soon finds the bravery to connect with his petite dainty next door neighbour Susanna (AnnaSophia Robb) to which he has taken a fancy.As coming-of-age stories go, this follows a pretty predictable scheme, after the initial setting is drawn the rest sweet and surely falls into place. Nonetheless enjoyment levels of the comedy-drama are very high, much owed to the well written script with moments of ingenious banter, coupled with the natural wit of man-child Sam Rockwell, who, albeit a supporting character, dominates the screen time. Whereas the story may not feel innovative, all the story traits seemingly well-worn and obvious retreads of similar features, ""The Way Way Back"" lets its feel-good presence take over and just flow with the water ride. Essentially American it does however breathe with an oft missed heartfelt truthfulness, where the situations and occurrences seem so familiarly close to home.The biggest trait of Nat Faxon's and Jim Rash's feature comes from the adult construct. Albeit Duncan dominates the screen time, ""The Way Way Back"" seems to be more about gaining awareness that adults themselves are flawed individuals, not the role models we so want them to be. This feel permeates throughout as Duncan sadly observes his insecure mother wriggle around a troubled relationship, gains knowledge that his father truly wants to live a life without him - a perceived burden - and oft realising that the immature Owen, far from perfect, may just possess the best outlook on life. May not transcend any expectations, but this is a purely enjoyable and even memorable movie which could be a welcome respite from mass-produced romantic comedies or insubstantial blockbusters.",The Way Way Back
55,rannynm,Entertaining Coming of Age Summer Film,7,27 June 2013,"""The Way Way Back"" tells the story of Duncan, played by Liam James, who is an awkward teen dealing with his mom's boyfriend, Trent, played by Steve Carell. Trent and Duncan don't exactly see eye to eye on most things and when the two of them are forced to spend the entire summer together, things get a bit complicated. Duncan decides to get away from his family by getting a job at the local amusement park, Water Wizz. There, he becomes friends with the manager Owen, played by Sam Rockwell, and Duncan begins to find himself with the help of his new friend.I personally do not like this movie very much. I feel like it has nothing to special about it and the acting seems very forced, the lines are cheesy and the plot is unoriginal. All of the scenes were long with very few cuts in them which did make it feel more realistic, but it also makes the film to drawn out and boring. This film is an hour and 43 minutes and it could have been a 60 minute film. I am also bothered by the fact that there is hardly any music in this film, so when there is silence it is awkward in a non comical way.My favorite character is Owen because I feel like Sam Rockwell is one of the only people who did their character justice. I even feel that Steve Carell is very monotonous and fake in this film, and I think he is usually a great actor. However I do like the character Owen for more than just that reason. He is very sweet to Duncan because he sees that he is having a hard time and he teaches him how to stand on his own. I also like Duncan, played by Liam James, because his character was generally very quiet and bland in a way, and Liam does a good job portraying his character.My favorite scene would have to be when Duncan is working his first day at Water Wizz. There is a bunch of teens break dancing in the park and Owen is supposed to break it up. Since he is such a slacker he gives Duncan this task and it is hilarious to watch him try to get the people to listen to him. It really shows how awkward he is and even though he is uncomfortable doing this task, he still does it to help out a friend. I recommend this film for ages 13+ because there is quite a bit of mild profanities, inappropriate humor and drug usage. Overall I give ""The Way Way Back' 3 out of 5 stars because it is entertaining for the time that you're in the theater, but it isn't memorable or something I would see again.

56,eric262003,What May Lack in Originality Makes Up For It In Enjoyment.,8,3 May 2020,"""The Way, Way, Back"" stars Liam James as a socially awkward teenage boy, Duncan who is forced to stay at his step-guardian's Trent(Steve Carrell) summer home in Massachusetts along with his mother Pam (Toni Collette) and his tuck-up adolescent daughter Steph (Zoe Levin). This may feel and look like the summer of hell at first for Duncan because he could not stand Trent and the shallow people surrounding them, but then after a trip to the Water Wizz water park he meets a positive-minded employee named Owen (Sam Rockwell) who's bound to change this young man's life forever.Usually with films of this calibre, the emphasis is primarily focused on dysfunctional families and the protagonists that need to look for ways to escape their wrath in order to find a new set of optimism about themselves and to find out that they too are something special. The perfect time of the year to exploit these family dynamics is during the summer season which at times can bring out the best in people while at the same time bring out the worst. Written by and directed by first timers Nat Faxon and Jim Rash, ""The Way, Way, Back"" focuses on the heartbreak, discomfort and cynicism that surrounds the teenage Duncan. In a familiar take like ""The Descendants"", which Faxon and Rash also wrote, the script depends heavily on the characterizations through their action and interactions with both the performers and their audiences alike. The film succeeds in keeping it real and the balance between laughter and sadness is presented quite naturally where the humour is light and never fall under being slapstick and the dramatic scenes are real without it becoming melancholic.The opening scenes is an eye-opener which sees Trent driving to his summer home while he questions Duncan who's sitting way, way of their stations and he interrogates Duncan with the question of how he rates himself from a score of 1-10. Duncan with a lot of hesitation rates himself with a humble 6, but Trent dismisses him by giving Duncan a 3. We can tell right away that this trip is going to be a nightmare.Duncan knows that he's a social outcast, but the sad part is that everyone knows he is too and does little or nothing to ensure that he's an all right kind of person. Even going as a far as to add more verbal put-downs by Trent's teenage daughter Steph and their summer home neighbour Betty (Allison Janney) who viciously berate him as a nerd. Janney nails her performance as a divorced as she spits verbal garbage without realizing that words can hurt harder than fists. AnnaSophia Robb stands out as Betty's daughter Susanna, who seems to have a more balance of level-headed intentions in how she interacts with Duncan.The real turning point in Duncan's much-needed transformation come when he first meets the Water Wizz employee, Owen. Sam Rockwell had the right tools when interacting with the awkward teen. Through his witty one-liners, his volatile but lovable nature and his non-judgmental way of looking at life, this man will put others before himself even if means putting off his other responsibilities which include maintaining the safety of the water park while also staying on good terms with longtime employee Caitlyn (Maya Rudolph who was underrated in her performance). While Trent and the others make Duncan look like a loser, Owen sees a winner in need to feel like one. It shows that in this world we live in, there might be a lot of Trent's it's also refreshing that the world has a lot of Owen's too. It's all about looking in the right direction. Liam James truly makes his performance special as we see his transformation from the awkward teen to young man with a new positive outlook on life.It was refreshing break to see Steve Carrell break out of typecast as he's playing a very awful human human being who thinks hurting the vulnerable makes all the more empowering. It's a contrast to the more loving humans we're used to seeing him perform. It just shows he could be very versatile as a performer. Toni Collette rounds out the ensemble cast as Duncan's mother/Trent's girlfriend Pam who wants to hold this family together, though wondering if she made the right choice to choose Trent as her lover while trying to do what's best for Duncan. Meanwhile though they are effective behind the camera, but Faxon and Rash show they could act quite good as fellow water park employees.And sure a coming-of-age story has been done many times before, what makes up for originality, makes up for it in terms of entertainment with laughable scenes, tearful moments, but overall with a feeling that will likely touch your hearts.",The Way Way Back
57,Sergeant_Tibbs,The Sam Rockwell Show.,7,12 September 2013,"The tagline for The Way Way Back is ""We've All Been There"" and as someone who was a very shy and awkward 14 year old I can re-assure that this film perfectly captures the feelings of that torturous age. Nat Faxon and Jim Rash won an Oscar for writing the mature and subtley comic The Descendants which is a film I quite like but it's a bit too dry to love. I wouldn't call The Way Way Back immature but compared to Descendants, it's certainly a few shades sillier, perhaps too silly at times. Again, they approach simple character drama in a very grounded way, but it's very effective. Perhaps there are a few too many clichéd archetypes but I will admit, it's ambitious to take on about a dozen of them and give each a story. It has a great cast for the most part, some more animated than others. Steve Carrell plays a great jerk, Allison Janney is a sideline highlight as the drunk middle-aged party girl and Toni Collette is ever reliable in her standard mother role with cameos from Rash and Faxon too. But it's Sam Rockwell who makes the whole film.Not only is he the comedic highlight with his awesome dry sense of humour but the dramatic highlight with his mentor relationship with the protagonist having the most emotional impact. After being disappointed by him in Seven Psychopaths it's great to see the Rockwell I love back. I had a great big grin on my face the whole time he was on screen and he definitely deserves all the hype he's getting. However, most reviews also criticise the lead Liam James and I have to agree. He's quite a blank slate which makes him very convincing during the awkward scenes but whenever he does something unusual or has an outburst it feels too uncharacteristic. It hurts the whole film. Perhaps that's just the way the character was written. While there was plenty of imagination in the script, the imagination in the photography let it down. The blocking and framing was ridiculously flat and made it look way cheaper than it was. I wouldn't have minded waiting another year for them to get funding for better cameras, cinematographer or more time storyboarding. Regardless, it was a fun way to spend an hour and a half.7/10",The Way Way Back
58,napierslogs,Actors deliver the comedy in an otherwise dysfunctional family drama,7,20 November 2013,"""The Way Way Back"" is a coming-of-age / dysfunctional family dramedy about Duncan (Liam James) trying to find his way to adulthood with a lost mother, her intentionally/unintentionally mean, new boyfriend, and his over-sexed daughter. And all the summer brings is an inappropriately over-sexed neighbour and her precocious daughter. Duncan just wants to get through adolescence and find a place he belongs. Regular readers will know that I find dysfunctional family dramedies tiring and this one doesn't start out much better.I need a hero, I'm holding out for a hero 'til the end of the night, He's gotta be strong, He's gotta be fast, And he's gotta be fresh from the fight. I need a hero, I'm holding out for a hero 'til the morning light, He's gotta be sure, And it's gotta be soon, And he's gotta be larger than life. It takes around 30 minutes, but eventually the film finds a hero in Sam Rockwell. He's absolutely hilarious, and livens the whole film up every time he's on screen. Not the least of which is one scene in which he dramatically says the entirety of Bonnie Tyler's ""Holding Out for a Hero"" in all seriousness waiting for the other characters to get the joke. At least the audience does.Owen (Rockwell) is a manager at a water park. Duncan wanders into the water park and decides Owen is a suitable role model. He shouldn't be, but comparatively he is. Owen and fellow water park employees enjoy all the adolescent goings-on since they haven't yet matured to their 40-ish ages. In particular, Roddy (Nat Faxon) and Owen liked to manipulate the bikini-clad girls into posing for them. They were of course very funny, so I'll let the one inconsistency slide (the bikini-clad girls would have been purposely posing in front of them, no manipulation necessary).The rest of the film was a drama. None of the adults were likable and Steve Carell playing mean isn't funny in and of itself. Allison Janney as the over-sexed neighbour was pretty funny, but Sam Rockwell was the highlight. It doesn't even matter if Duncan found his way in ""The Way Way Back"" because Owen did.",The Way Way Back
59,drjgardner,Good acting in an enjoyable coming of age comedy,5,14 August 2013,"""The Way Way Back"" has some excellent acting, hampered only by a predictable script with few, if any, surprises and a lack of a memorable musical score.Allison Janey (""West Wing"") is the scene stealer and she dominates every time she makes an appearance. But the surprise is 20 year old AnnaSophia Robb who plays her sulky daughter. While Janey makes her marks with an over-the-top flamboyance, Robb is quiet, using her face and her body to communicate volumes.Steve Carell shows he's capable of playing an ordinary person, after so many off-beat (to be kind) performances (""The Office"", ""40 Year Old Virgin"", ""Dinner for Schmucks""), and the rest of the cast (Amanda Peet, Toni Collette, Sam Rockwell, Maya Rudolph) all do well.The ""coming of age"" theme might have been better developed had it focused a little more on the other changes (Rockwell's decision to be more grown up, Collette's decision to put her son's needs ahead of her boyfriend), instead of the blossoming of Liam James, the 14 year old star of the film. A little nip and tuck here and there and this could have been a much better film, and this is often a problem when the actors, writers and the directors share the same pair of pants - Nat Faxon and Jim Rash.Bottom line – an enjoyable ""coming of age"" story that you can take your kids to.",The Way Way Back
60,sharky_55,I'm getting complaints. You're having way too much fun.,7,19 September 2015,"Liam James is 14 year old Duncan and just as awkward as Keir Gilchrist in It's Kind of a Funny Story, only here he's not depressed, he's just a child of divorce and is being attacked from every angle. Well, anyone who has been a teenager can relate to the broody and mopey looks he gives his mum when she tells him to get out more or make some friends, or in many cases, at least try a little with his stepdad. I love that little reversal. Faxon and Rash, after their Oscar for their screenplay for the Descendants, helm this in their directorial debut as well as both playing a part in the staff of the local water park, Water Wizz, a aged relic of the past as Rockwell so endearingly describes it. One's a womanising joker while the other's an uptight neurotic (Jim Rash playing Jim Rash) and while they aren't exactly the most fleshed out characters, they are crucial in establishing that family dynamic that all the workers have. Better are Rockwell and Rudoplh, who are like the old married couple, always squabbling but ever leaning on each other. Initially I thought Duncan's revelation might have come from the source of the radiant Susanna (AnnaSophia Robb), which is hinted at but switched for the wise guru that is Rockwell's Owen. The adults are similarly well cast and acted. Toni Collete and Steve Carell shine as the trouble in paradise couple, while Allison Janey her usual role as the wild single mother with no inhibitions. The Way Way Back is uneven to say the least, but it knows exactly what it wants to say and what it wants the audience to think at the end of it. It doesn't always execute with success; there are some cringe-worthy segments like the teen-talk on the beach with Steph and her dumb friends (who is really just a place-holder character) and the dance segment that leads to Duncan getting his famous nickname, which seems ripped straight out of a direct-to-TV kids movie. But more importantly it's about Duncan growing up just a little and having the courage to speak his mind and find his own way. The Water Wizz staff are crucial to this (as is Kyle), and it needs to build upon the complex and strained relationship that his mum and step-dad have. Carell plays a great asshole, which is seldom a role he is known for - the kind of guy who has eyes only for Pam and sees his son as an outcast, a failed experiment, a three out of ten. Yes, what a fantastic way to set up that guide of a tough love relationship. And what a harsh and unflinching delivery on that damning statement to his stepson: ""He doesn't want you, kid!"" Toni Colette is even better; she seems to thrive in these emotionally wrecked and vulnerable roles. The way her face crumples as she admits that maybe staying with a cheater is better than being alone is heartbreakingly genuine. She cannot run away from Trent, and cannot bear to be confronted with the truth in a tense scene where Duncan finally breaks his silence. It pretty much makes up for those little awkward lapses in James' performance (or maybe the screenplay/direction wanted this specifically - in any case it's far too grating and common for these types of characters). I am pleasantly surprised at how TWWB doesn't dissolve into clichés and expectations of the usual romcom situations. Duncan in his misery goes for a kiss with Susanna, but she backs away hesitatingly, only to return it the next morning. She was just taken by surprise of course, which is okay. Owen and Caitlin lean on each other and seem to discover a new found mutual appreciation instead of reconciling some long passionate love affair. When he finally meets Trent, there isn't some trivial and unheard 'treat this kid' right speech, maybe because he knows it will go into one ear and out Trent's other. He stands their protectively in fron of Duncan, a father figure for the first time in his life, and Trent just doesn't care enough to do anything about it. And in that last shot, we don't see Pam and Duncan running off and starting a grand new life. All they have is each other really, but that just might enough, and they finally admit it.",The Way Way Back

There are some movies which sound so simple that it's hard to convey to people just how good they are. The Way, Way Back is one of those movies. It's simply a coming-of-age story about a 14-year-old boy over the course of his summer break. There are no big action scenes or special effects here, just really good writing with actors who can bring such a realistic story to life.The movie begins with the boy, Duncan, riding in a car with his family to his mother's boyfriend's beach house. As the mother sleeps in the passenger seat, the boyfriend asks Duncan to rate himself on a scale of 1 to 10. After replying with a 6, the boyfriend insists that he's just a 3. What's surprising is that this seemingly heartless guy that the mother is dating is played by Steve Carell. Carell is known for playing lovable and funny characters. But he switches it up with this role. That scene sets the tone for how little Duncan is looking forward to this summer trip. And it doesn't help that his mother doesn't really set her boyfriend straight even when she is awake.To escape the annoyances at his new temporary home, Duncan takes a bike to ride around town with. When he finds a way into the local water park, he meets one of the middle-aged operators there named Owen. Duncan seems fascinated by Owen and how he uses humor in almost everything he says. It seems like he's never met anyone like him who's so worry-free and exudes such confidence all the time. Owen manages to get Duncan a job at the park where he tries to instill some of that same confidence in him as well. It becomes clear that as they bond with each other, Duncan wishes this would be the kind of guy his mother would date instead. The job at the water park also opens up a whole new fun side that this 14-year-old kid didn't even know he had in him. Amazing score by Rob Simonsen(500 Days Of Summer), Costume Design By Michelle Matland(Closer) & Ann Roth(Signs ) and Amazing Direction/Writing by Nat Faxon(The Descendents) & Jim Rash(Adopted) Truly heartfelt and Hilarious Dramedy 8/10",The Way Way Back

The way way back is a coming of age movie and follows shy Duncan on his summer vacation with mother and step dad. I'm sure the relationship between Duncan and parents will be familiar to many people. The good thing about this type of movie is that it focuses more on characters and you get a real sense, feel and empathy for several characters. The cast is strong and in addition to the lead played by Liam James you have the likes of Steve Carell, Toni Collette and Sam Rockwell.The movie does occasionally get a little too ""feel good"", but that's a small drawback in what is otherwise a very enjoyable watch.

66,bryank-04844,Rash and Faxon hit a home run with this little film that won't soon be forgotten. See this movie as soon as possible.,10,23 August 2015,"Hot off their Oscar win for 'The Descendants', screenwriters Jim Rash and Nat Faxon hop into the director's chair for the first time with the incredible summer flick 'The Way, Way Back'. The comedy duo pulls triple duty on this film, serving as directors, writers and actors. That's no easy feat, but they pull it off with grace, fun and great comedy. This little movie with an all-star cast is easily in my Top 5 of the year so far.If you were born in the '70s or '80s, your parents probably owned a station wagon at some point. The movie's title, 'The Way, Way Back', refers to the far back, rear- facing bench seat that, as kids, we fought over to ride in. My dad had a silver and brown wagon, and no matter if we drove two minutes away or two hours away, I always wanted to sit in the Way, Way Back. This little slice of life brings back great nostalgic memories.'The Way, Way Back' reminds me a lot of movies like 'Adventureland' and 'Little Miss Sunshine'. The film takes place mostly at a water park in a small beach community during the middle of summer. We follow a young teen named Duncan (Liam James), who sets out to find himself and gain confidence to talk with girls and become his own person. On a summer-long trip to their beach house, Duncan gets stuck with his mother Pam (Toni Collette) and her new boyfriend Trent (Steve Carell), who has his own teen daughter named Steph (Zoe Levin). Trent constantly picks on Duncan for no apparent reason. Steph seems to take after her father and torments Duncan as well.Duncan spends a lot of time at a water park called Water Wizz, which is owned by a fun guy named Owen (Sam Rockwell). Owen sees something in Duncan and decides to make his life better by offering him a job at the water park. Duncan happily accepts, though he doesn't tell anybody at home about it.While at the job, Owen teaches Duncan how to gain confidence by way of long, comedic monologues and inappropriate jokes at the expense of others. Owen's jokes seem to go over everyone else's heads, as his clientèle are two decades younger than he is. Owen also shows Duncan how to talk to women, such as Duncan's crush Susanna (AnnaSophia Robb), who lives in the area year-round with her over-the-top gossipy mom Betty (Allison Janney).This is one of the better of coming-of-age films in a long time and I can't wait to spend time with these characters again. The writing is flawless. Nothing is ever out- of-place in this film, and the pacing is spot-on. The movie has an even blend of gut- busting comedy and dramatic situations that will pull you closer and closer towards these characters. It's nice to see Steve Carell drop his usual nice guy shtick and play a real slime-ball here. He's great in this role, even if you wind up hating the character.Rockwell shines here and deserves an award for this performance. Meanwhile, Janney is a force of comedy to be reckoned with and had me in stitches every time she was on-screen. The movie also features a few great cameos from Rob Corddry, Amanda Peet and Maya Rudolph.Rash and Faxon hit a home run with this little film that won't soon be forgotten.

67,witster18,solid.,8,21 November 2013,"I was wanting just a little more payoff here. Duncan, the lead, gets his say in the end, but not nearly enough.On a bright note - Sam Rockwell deserves a supporting Oscar nomination for this, though he probably won't get one. LATE edit - That marks the 4rth time I think he's been snubbed(Hitchikers Guide, Moon, and most especially Confessions of a Dangerous Mind) ""The Way Way Back"" is an enjoyable coming-of-age tale about a young teenager who makes a trip to his mother's boyfriends' beach house.Everything works here, but I think the movie would have benefited greatly with one extra scene with Duncan going back, or even writing or connecting with his love-interest one more time. While I site this as a weakness - the 'wanting more' aspect of coming-of-age films is usually a sign of greatness. This might grow on me more, and deserve a second viewing.76/100Can't remember the actress' name that plays the neighbor - she's always great(REALLY good here).You'll like this if you liked(or, now check out):Adventureland(equally as good), SUmmer of '42(a tad better), or The Ice Storm(better).But those are all really good flicks - so don't let that discourage you from seeing this fine film.",The Way Way Back
68,Carycomic,"I did not think it was possible. But, I was wrong.",1,4 August 2013,"Or, rather, Steve Carell proved me wrong. There _is_ a worse film, this summer, than Sandra Bullock's ""The Heat."" And, this is it!First off; there was no advance publicity. No trailers in the movie theaters or on television. Not a very encouraging sign. Then, came the second shocker: I WAS LITERALLY THE ONLY ONE IN THEATER SHOWING THIS FLICK!Discouraging sign number three; Carell and Amanda Peet were the only recognizable name actors in the cast. And, in his case, that's most definitely _not_ a good recommendation for throwing your money away on seeing this film (like I, unfortunately, did).If you want to see a _really good_ coming-of-age film, go rent a DVD of ""The Flamingo Kid"" starring Matt Dillon and Richard Crenna. It's set in NYC of the early Sixties, rather than Cape Cod of the mid-1980's. But, the theme is pretty much the same; the acting a whole lot better; and the angsty hero way easier to empathize with.Oh, and in case Carell thinks I forgot what I said in my ""Blunderstone"" review?

69,Likes_Ninjas90,You can still put a price on a great script in Hollywood,8,31 July 2013,"You can still put a price on a great script in Hollywood. The Way Way Back was shown at the Sundance Film Festival and then the distribution rights were auctioned off to Fox Searchlight for a little under $10 million dollars. The bidding was described by the Los Angeles Times as: ""In what could be one of the richest deals in Sundance Film Festival history"". This proves two things. Fox were rightly confident in the film's quality, it's an excellent movie, and that studios are willing to pay big dollars for films with great scripts because of how rare they are today. However, this is a film made by smart people. After winning an Oscar for writing The Descendants, Nat Faxon and Jim Rash make their directional debuts, along with co-scripting the film and featuring in small roles too. They prove here they are as talented behind the camera, working closely with young and seasoned actors to enrich a story that is partly a coming of age tale but also critical about the juvenility of its adult characters too. For a film that only cost $4 million dollars to make, I found this funnier and outrightly more enjoyable than any major blockbuster released during the American summer this year.Liam James plays Duncan, a fourteen year old boy who is spending his summer vacation with his mother Pam (Toni Collette), her new boyfriend Trent (Steve Carell) and his daughter Steph (Zoe Levin). Duncan and Trent don't get along because Trent is critical of him and isn't sensitive to how shy and subdued he is. They're also surrounded by kooky neighbours, including the hilariously outspoken Betty (Allison Janney), who has a son with a lazy eye and a daughter named Susanna (AnnaSophia Robb). Trent is also spending too much time with his friends Kip (Rob Corddry) and Joan (Amanda Peet). To make the most of his time, Duncan visits a waterslide park and is nurtured by Owen (Sam Rockwell) who works there. Owen encourages him to loosen up and have more fun, despite his own fluctuating relationship with his boss Caitlin (Maya Rudolph), who questions his responsibility and work ethic.The strength of the script is that it realises that there is something to be lost if Duncan were not to blossom while he is still young. He is surrounded by adult characters that are complacent, jealous and disappointed with their lives. Several of the characters in the film are also divorcees and brush with infidelity too, which heightens the film's awareness of people becoming desperate in unhappy situations. The film achieves a dual layering. It is a coming of age story but it never over or underplays its sadder impression of an incompatible family unit and how people make wrong choices when their lives appear to be in stasis. The film's opening image is a static medium close-up of Duncan sitting alone in the car, which underscores his immobility and lack of self- belief. Countering its somewhat bleaker subtext, the film is written with great flair and some hilariously funny dialogue. I particularly liked the line where Betty says that her gay ex-husband's favourite view of her was the back of her head. Together, Faxon and Rash have also done a terrific job in providing each character with a unique voice. This is due to how well-chosen the actors are and how convincingly they inhabit their characters. Liam James is astonishingly good at expressing Duncan's feelings through his slumped and disengaged body language and monotone voice. This is until he takes responsibility for his own life and grows more confident in his skin and finds a gentle bond of commonality with the beautiful Susanna.On either side of him are two men with contrasting acting styles and dialogue rhythms. Steve Carell is uncharacteristically serious and rigid as Trent, who is overly harsh in singling out Duncan, but we understand that he wants to instill rules into him. He's just stubborn and terrible at empathising with other people. Sam Rockwell as the slacker Owen snatches the movie with one of the funniest, most energised, manic performances I've seen all year. His jokes and sarcasm are fast and loose and earned the biggest laughs at the screening. Significantly, he adds the right dosage of kindness to his character, without becoming overly sentimental either. Toni Collette has a comparatively small role, but it's an expressive, pivotal one that requires her clearly uncomfortable character to make a serious choice about her own unhappy life.This hilarious, warm and surprisingly touching film is proof that there is still value in small, human comedy-dramas and that they don't necessarily have to break the bank. It's heartening to see a script of this quality can still be produced and supported by Hollywood heavyweights. Yet there's also a somber melancholy that this retreat away is ready to end and we'll be returning to our ordinary cinema lives of robots, ninjas and superheroes. If only the vacation could last a little longer.",The Way Way Back

This is a really good movie that opens up just past the halfway mark, and you get a real feeling of family from the places you didn't expect them, and the need for a Father figure is filled very well. I Enjoyed the characters, and the interaction that was obviously a lot of improv. The story is really good once it gets past the unpacking phase of day one.

73,RevRonster,Dramedy done right...,9,7 November 2013,"At this point, I will pretty much see anything with Steve Carell or Sam Rockwell and since they were both in this one, it's like I won the lottery...granted, lottery in the form of a really entertaining movie and not in the way that anyone actually wants to win the lottery.Coming-of-age stories and films about awkward teens/adults/people coming out of their shells once they meet the right person to show them they have worth isn't anything new or original. However, writer/directors Nat Faxon and Jim Rash presented a film that was both simultaneously familiar and new. The movie was capable of making you laugh your backside off but then, the next moment, made you feel towards the characters and their journeys. To put it simply, Faxon and Rash made a very human film with real emotion behind it.This emotional element was only supported and enhanced by the terrific cast the film had. Liam James is great as Duncan, the awkward teen. Steve Carell really showed another side of his talent by playing the really awful boyfriend of Duncan's mother. Toni Collette is once again incredible as she portrays Duncan's mom but the real show stealer for me was Sam Rockwell as Owen; the man who is, for the most part, a complete slacker working at the local water park but also becomes Duncan's best friend and the person who teaches him that he has self worth and is greater than he realizes. Rockwell's performance makes the film go even further as his friendship with Duncan makes it a semi-buddy comedy as well as a comedy of age comedy/drama.The movie is one of those bittersweet comedies/dramas that can make you feel a whole range of emotions as the running length progresses. On the surface it could look like a dozen movies that can out over the years before it but the final product is so much more and has so much more heart than I had originally anticipated.Hi!

74,cultfilmfreaksdotcom,Way Way Bland,1,1 August 2013,"At one point when the main character, or in this case semi-main character, Duncan, a reclusive fourteen-year old boy who, with his mother, her jerky boyfriend and his melancholy daughter, go to a small beachside town for a summer vacation Duncan and another underdog friend are about to climb a fence to break into a work party when one of the employees, two feet away, opens the gate door and tells the kids there's a much easier way inside. That's THE WAY WAY BACK in a nutshell – instead of anything interesting, intriguing or involving actually happening, stuff simply happens.For a so-called ""Coming of Age"" tale, way too much time centers on Duncan's mother and her boyfriend. Toni Collette and Steve Carell are going through the motions. Along with another boring couple, all they really do is sit around laughing, talking and drinking while Duncan sulks alone in his room, but not for longSoon the gloomy kid ventures out on his bike and finds a retro Water Park, built in the eighties and made to stay that way. This is where the movie is supposed to shine, and with Sam Rockwell's laidback and always-jokey Owen, who manages the park, Duncan has a real friend and any turmoil or discomfort is thrown right out the door. While Rockwell's is engaging enough, if you've seen Bill Murray in Meatballs the performance, a cross between a game show host and your favorite uncle, seems as retro as the Tough Skin jeans, REO Speedwagon or other nostalgic bits of pop culture references thrown in to make the present time more reflective in nature.A sulky, one-dimensional Liam James, as Duncan, makes for a dull protagonist. With a cool summer job, an even cooler mentor and a hot blonde living next door, it's difficult (if impossible) feeling sorry for a kid with so many options.",The Way Way Back

76,dansview,Clichéd but Good,7,11 April 2015,"When I saw the wood-paneled station wagon, I thought it would be a period piece, but it takes place in the present. But media-makers of the present day are often people who grew up in the 70's and 80's, it makes sense that they would make films with references to their own pasts.In this case, the character played by Steve Carrell, who owns the station wagon, explains that it was his dad's car during the years when his family would go to the same beach house where this takes place.There are no computers or cell phones in this movie and the bicycle the kid rides seems to have been left in the garage since the 70's. The water park itself is old and purposely unchanged, per the owner's wishes. So there is a total ""retro"" feel to this movie.Having been the lead ""Duncan"" character, almost exactly, in the summer of '78, I could painfully relate. The actors playing kids were actually considerably older in real life, which I guess you have to be, in order to channel the emotions of a particular age. It would be harder if they were the actual age they portrayed, because they wouldn't have any perspective.At times I felt like the film makers were trying too hard to create an ""indie"" vibe, just like they did with The Descendants, and like so many ""indie"" makers do. These pictures always seem to be about dysfunctional families, secular values, and the seeming pointlessness of life.I disagree a tad with the other reviewers about the acting. I felt that the kooky lush lady next door was over-the-top, as was the water park manager. Both those actors are obviously talented, but the direction probably forced them to try too hard to steal the scenes.For example, there was a scene at the water park that made me cringe. The boy finally gets a girl to visit him and he is talking to her. Then the kooky park manager grabs a PA system microphone and starts showing off for the girl and embarrassing the boy, while calling him away from the girl for no good reason. I don't believe he would do that, and if he would, it would make him an idiot. Yet the director felt that we needed another scene where that guy is the center of attention. Mistake.The guy playing the lead awkward kid was great. This made up for everything. His body posture and facial expressions perfectly captured the vibe of his character. The girl next door was just right also. She delicately tried to bring out his personality without making fun of him.I am so glad they didn't have these two falling in love, or have the boy suddenly become the stud of the town, like the main character in Heavenly Kid, another coming-of-age flick that really was from the 80's.No, they kept it real this time. He doesn't get the girl, there is no happy ending with the parents, and he doesn't become Mr. Confidence. But through the help of an older guy and some others who had patience with him, he comes a bit out of his shell. This will undoubtedly help him in the coming school year.We are supposed to see something of a parallel going on with the park manager character who also needs to grow up. Thankfully we are not asked to think his irresponsibility is entirely cute. His employee and love interest points out that it's a bit pathetic. Good. That's a good message. Don't make the immature adult a hero.Also, there was no obnoxious soundtrack with hits. I hate when movies rely on old hits, instead of creating an original soundtrack. The east coast beach town looked lovely. Fortunately they did not focus on the ocean and nature, because that's not what this picture was about.Overall, a good ride. Surprisingly decent.",The Way Way Back
77,Marc_Israel_365,A summer movie that resonates,8,29 June 2014,"The movie actually captures what summer represented to many of us, coming of age through discovery. No school, less parental rules and adventure, no matter what the circumstance. The Way Way Back captures the realization of self better than any I've seen in a while. I enjoyed the the overbearing roles a ton: Allison Janney and Sam Rockwell, but had a hard time getting past Steve Carell's character being so vengeful against the kid. This means he did a great job, but bullying and hurtful to a young mind growing. The movie message, while centered around this forced relationship, doesn't get swallowed up by it. The best moment was seeing the Employee Of The Month sign of young beaming Duncan (Liam James). That's the moment of realization! I also love the clear message of what is behind mean behavior: it's about them, so don't wear the beat downs that others are trying to place upon you. In the days of introverted sadness all over the news, this is a bit of ""Meatballs"" in todays' America, even though the REO Speedwagon and Stationwagon clearly date the film otherwise.",The Way Way Back

On this holiday, Duncan discovers the local park Water Wizz and a new friend Owen (Sam Rockwell) who helps him come out of his shell and enjoy life to its fullest! Writer/director team Nat Faxon & Jim Rash (The Descendants, Community) seem like they create such a comfortable and lovely atmosphere on set because the film is just exuberantly joyful while also covering teenage angst and the feeling of isolation really well. As Duncan's isolation decreases and self-confidence begins to grow over the course of the story, it's a really exhilarating feeling and it completely work on an emotional level. It showcases a brilliant ensemble cast; the great Toni Collette as Pam, Duncan's mother who tries really hard to keep balance in their family life despite her partners intentions, Steve Carell who does a great job portraying an infuriating person like Trent, their neighbours Betty and Peter played hilariously by Allison Janney and River Alexander. Owen is a really fantastic character and is one of Sam Rockwell's best performances; he is really relaxed, happy-go-lucky and so funny, a lot to do with the beating heart of the film! Duncan's first love Susanna is played really well by AnnaSophia Robb (Charlie & the Chocolate Factory, Bridge To Terabithia) and having only known her as Violet Beauregarde before, it's great to see her in a different role! Owen's love interest Caitlin played by Maya Rudolph is also fantastic. The thing that makes this is that each character has their own story; their own heartaches and their own journeys.

80,bix171,Slight,5,23 November 2014,"The filmmakers, Nat Faxon and Jim Rash (along with Alexander Payne) wrote the beautiful and pensive screenplay for ""The Descendants"" and perhaps it's too much to ask for a comparable effort in their directorial debut, when the slight story--about the coming of age of a fourteen year-old product of a broken home (Liam James) on a summer trip with his mother (Toni Collette) and her bullying boyfriend (Steve Carell)--will seem familiar to many viewers. Part of the problem is James, who seems almost too comfortable in his unhappiness, so much so that he's unconvincing when he reaches his inevitable breakthrough; this is accomplished with the help of a droll water park manager (a likable Sam Rockwell) who takes James under his wing and provides welcome comic relief against the overly dramatic main story. There's not a whole lot to talk about here, with competent performances from Collette and Carell (and wasted ones from Maya Rudolph, Rob Corddry and Amanda Peet) contributing to the minimized expectations.

Obviously you begin to see a change in his personality as he matures into a more secure man (in fact this is possibly the best portrayal of changing personalities I've seen in film as it doesn't swing to far left field). But leading to this point feels like a trek. The beginning half of the film is an inescapable torture that has you feeling quite pessimistic about the final half.Though the film lifts in it's final act and does a good job at wrapping the film up, you can't escape the mindless agony that has to be endured in order to see where our characters end up.",The Way Way Back

He's awkward, shy and doesn't have much self-steem. He only sees himself as a 6. And yet his mom's boyfriend says that he's only a 3. He continually picks on Duncan and belittles him. Steve Carell plays the the boyfriend Trent. And he plays an a-hole perfectly. Its kind of nice to see him do more ""serious"" roles every once in awhile. However, despite all this he finds a father figure in Owen (Sam Rockwell). And Sam really shines in this role. I would personally put him on my list for a Best Supporting nomination. He's fantastic. Zany, comical and poignant at times. I was especially moved between the conversation Owen and Duncan share towards the end of the film. And then a bit later on when Owen meets Trent, and Owen stands right in front of Duncan TO PROTECT HIM! That had me tearing up again. I also really felt for Pam (Toni Collette) at times. And Toni played her character very well. A very vulnerable mother. Allison Janney was also pretty charming in this. She plays kind of a kooky, boozy neighbour.

Duncan is shy and doesn't really fit in with anyone else, until he meets a friend called Owen, who works at a water park.There is a lot of character development in this film, we see relationships building up, crossing over with each other and also some failing.

Sam Rockwell is terrific as Owen and so is Liam James as Duncan, the friendship these two build up is heart warming.

Stumbling across a local water-park employee ""Owen"" (Sam Rockwell) playing ""Pacman"", the two form a bond which enables Duncan to work casually at the water-park and fill his days.This is a classic coming of age story and James fits the bill very well, acting just like a shy fourteen year old, all elbows, bad dancing and hopeless ""chit chat"" with Betty's pretty daughter.With a cast this good, you would expect the acting to be of a high standard, Carrell playing against type makes an unlike-able character, thoroughly unlike-able. Janney does ""well intended but over bearing"" well enough but the stand out as usual is Collett. Generating bonhomie, real and faux one moment, leading to a quiet realisation, awkwardness and alienation the next.The subtext of older people making compromises due to sheer practicality comes to the fore, is it ever worth settling for less, if it impacts those you love? Those who occasionally play board games on a rainy day will also enjoy one particular key scene. Has there ever been a time when, ""Let's check the rules on the lid of the box"", ended well.Rockwell usually watchable, remains so here but is saddled with an unlikely character, although the mentor/father relationship with Duncan does work reasonably well. The fact the ""pool gang"" help shape Duncan into the person he will become, rings true but the film sags badly in the middle section, almost grinding to a halt at one point. There are some questionable scenes and character quirk diversions, which distracts from the central theme.Dual director's Jim Rash and Nat Faxon, are also seen in the movie. Rash as ""Lewis"", the slightly odd towel and bathing hut attendant. Lewis is always about to leave for better things but like everyone else, seems stuck in time and familiarity. Faxon as lecherous pool slide attendant ""Roddy"", stop/ starting the line to indulge his skimpy bathing costume passion, a trick he dubiously teaches Duncan Summary A coming of age tale that at 103 minutes achieves what it sets out to do in the allotted time.A gentle film with a promising start and ending on a flourish. By no means the best example of the genre but due to the strength of the cast, the film just about makes it home from the beach.",The Way Way Back
93,themissingpatient,As Good as Coming-Of-Age Comedies Get,8,5 November 2013,"Trent and Pam, Steve Carell and Toni Collette, are spending the summer at Trent's beach house with his teenage daughter and her 14 year old son, Duncan. They spend their time drinking with Trent's friends Kip, played by Rob Corddry, Joan, played by Amanda Peet, and their alcoholic neighbor, Betty, played Allison Janney. Duncan, out-of-place and constantly being humiliated, finds a friend in Owen, played by Sam Rockwell, the manager of a water park.The cast is great. Steve Carell works well as a detestable villain. It's Sam Rockwell and Maya Rudolph we want to see more of, excellent on-screen chemistry. Liam James, who plays Duncan, does well for a young actor carrying a feature film. Nat Faxon and Jim Rash, the writers and directors, have perfectly balanced the comedy with drama and deliver a heartfelt ending.The Way Way Back is as good as coming-of-age comedies get.",The Way Way Back

With a great cast, this film hits all of the emotional beats that it sets out for. Sam Rockwell is slowly becoming my favorite actor...with every performance he gives, he steals the show and is normally the most likeable character in all of his films. Not to undermine the other performances because they were also superb. The only thing that may be a negative is the cliche themes and plot devices, but a movie like this does not need abstract or complex themes to present its message. I enjoyed just about every minute and it will definitely be one of my top summer movies to go back and revisit.",The Way Way Back
95,Doublej20005,A Great Coming of Age Film,8,5 April 2021,"Really liked this film! There were a couple of elements that annoyed me - the score was genuinely obnoxious, and some of the humour was a bit hit or miss at times, but it works because of the well developed characters, strong direction and a fantastic third act, which nails the conclusion of the character arcs and wraps up the story really well. The ensemble cast is great, particularly Sam Rockwell, and the fast pacing really helped to keep me engaged. The tone was balanced extremely well, with the dramatic moments never feeling out of place. Whilst I did say that some of the humour fell flat, some of it definitely did work, and the characters were really quirky and as such enjoyable for me. The themes mostly landed and the ending was very satisfying, and boosted the score up a fair bit. Overall, it isn't flawless, but it is a lot of fun.",The Way Way Back
96,The_moan_of_all_moans,ahhhhhhh it's OK.,6,9 September 2013,"It's a typical,feel good movie that targets the heart and even the most miserable of people would succumb to a few smiles. I get why people like it, the acting is great, by all, but some of the scenes where so cringe-worthy and it almost tries too hard to make you feel empathy towards Duncan (Liam James). I sometimes felt i had to look away because i didn't want to cringe anymore. Now that aside it is an enjoyable film that you can't help but invest in. The star of the show is by far Sam Rockwell as Owen; easily one of the most under-rated and underused actor around today. His ability is so blatant and i don't understand why he is not a leading man in Hollywood yet. Allison Janney is great also; delivery is executed perfectly and even Steve Carell was an interesting choice as the serious, uncaring Trent.All in all it is definitely worth the watch; although (as i'm not a fan of over-cringing) i would have preferred it to be less cheesy at points.6/10",The Way Way Back
97,byson5186,I Can't Think Of A Movie With More Relatable Characters,10,17 September 2014,"I own a copy of this movie. Before I bought one, I wanted to watch this movie in the movie theaters as it looked good, but it had a limited release and I didn't see it in the theaters. When it came out, I rented a copy of it from RedBox, and liked the movie a lot, I'd later order it On Demand, and then later bought my own Blu Ray Copy Of It. I have to tell you, this movie is a great movie and if you look at most of the reviews you see on here, IMDb.com you'll see how most of the people like it. You can look at other reviews on this movie from other sites like Amazon or even look at the reception of this film from Wikipedia and you'll see mostly positive reviews showing how well this film has been received among the audience and critics. What is good about this film, well like my title says the characters are relatable. While I've heard about the actors being like well known actors and from other films, I don't know the actors from other films except Liam James from 2012, and Anna Sophie Robb in lots of other films. The other actors I'm not familiar with, but they're good actors. These actors seem like your everyday people, not just somebody we recognize as a famous actor from a TV show or movie. The conversations they have and things they talk about seem like regular conversations. The way these people hang out seem like the way a lot of families would hang out with their friends. Also, a lot of movies nowadays seem to have trouble coming up with an interesting out of the ordinary plot that would entertain audiences, along with showing really special effects that would entertain an audience. This movie does not show special effects which is great showing we can have very entertaining great movies without special effects. Also, a lot of times when we watch movies the things which happen on movies seem more like things that only happen in movies for movie entertainment, but couldn't happen or are unlikely to happen in real life. In Way Way Back, the things that happen don't seem unrealistic. This movie also shows a small town that we've probably never been to, but it looks like a town we could be in. The town featuring it's main attraction in the movie the Water Park, Water Wizz and as water parks seem fun and appealing to be at, some shots from the water park will make it look like you're at the water park when you see it on screen. So yeah, I've talked about how this movie shows relatable characters, a realistic plot, and a typical looking town. This movie is also a really funny movie, and it is not a slow paced movie despite the things I listed above which might make it sound like a slow paced movie. Basically, the whole movie is entertaining and this is a movie I can watch over and over again if I'm looking for an enjoyable movie to watch that can entertain myself or a friend. I'm sure a lot of you'd like this and it would be a good movie for you to show friends if you wanted a movie night. Even if he isn't at the top of the cast list, the main character from this movie is Duncan, played by Liam James. Again, he's a relatable character a character I definitely can relate to. He's shy and stuff which is why his mom's boyfriend, Trent gives Duncan a low rating in the beginning of the movie which is what the IMDb trivia said was the main inspiration for this movie. Duncan's also relatable in one scene which I hope doesn't count as a spoiler, but when he goes on a boat with his family and friends he was the only one wearing a life vest and asks why he has to wear one when nobody else does. I'm sure we've all felt that way, doing something we felt like nobody else had to do especially during adolescence, so that was a good perspective to give us. But, the main thing about this movie is how shy Duncan gets involved in something big in the town after he meets Owen, who was like the owner of Water Wizz. Owen is a nice and sarcastic man playing all these jokes with Duncan that Duncan believes showing he's gullible, and yeah I've been pretty gullible to. We see how Duncan's involvement changes his life and perspective and he starts to look better than he did at the beginning of the movie. The thing this movie reminds me of is Katy Perry's song, Firework. So, if you haven't seen this and are looking for a good movie to see, I'd strongly recommend it. I give this movie 10/10 and this movie helps me to be less shy and get more involved in things.",The Way Way Back
98,Katz5,A movie to cherish,9,20 July 2021,"I adore this movie. To me, it depicts an awkward age that every introverted kid has to wrestle with, more so than more popular movies like Stand by Me. The main character is Duncan, a sullen, depressed pre-teen who vacations with his divorced mom (Toni Collette) and her obnoxious new man (Steve Carrell, a long way from Seeking a Friend for the End of the World, which came out the previous year). The family heads to Carrell's beach home in an unnamed town that could be near Cape Cod, or somewhere on Long Island.The other characters appear almost immediately as Carrell drives his station wagon with a ""way way back"" seat (hence the film's title) into the driveway. Characters tailor made for the comedy stylings of Allison Janey (a lush, totally flirtatious, and not the greatest role model for her children), Rob Corddry (once again playing Carrell's best friend), and Amanda Peet (as Corddry's Mr. Mister-loving current girlfriend).Without revealing too much of the plot, during the course of the summer, Duncan pulls himself out of his shell, particularly after taking a job at a nearby water park owned by a perpetual slacker named Owen, played by Sam Rockwell, and managed by Owen's one-time girlfriend (Maya Rudolph). Owen becomes a surrogate big brother to Duncan, giving him life lessons while boosting his ego.This is one of Sam Rockwell's most appealing characters. The talented former actor, who finally has an Oscar, as built a career out of playing weirdos or psychos. You get the feeling by the end of the movie that Owen really loves Duncan as a brother, or even son, and Rockwell's natural performance seals it. He's backed by actor and screenwriter Nate Faxon, who also co-wrote equally charming Alexander Payne comedy/drama ""The Descendants,"" and who was so hilarious as the stoner in ""Hamlet 2.""The movie has a mid '70s look and feel to it, and not just because of the car Carrell drives. The beach town is lifted straight from the town in ""Jaws,"" yet the characters have cell phones and iPods - this odd mashing of American beach town eras gives the action in the film a nearly fantastical quality. And every character, including the kids in the film, have some zingers (the slightly older girl next door, daughter of Janney's character and played by AnnaSophia Robb, has a hilarious line about Duncan's love of REO Speedwagon).A relatively unknown movie that you should seek out and treasure.",The Way Way Back
99,s_campanale,Good clean adolescent angst fun by the sea where the adults are kids and the kids are adults.,9,1 September 2013,"The coming of age story is one of the oldest in human history, but more recently (at least since the 1950s when the concept of the ""teenager"" was born and instantly bottled and marketed) it has taken the form of the angst ridden youth whose adolescence is a pained period of self- loathing, clumsy first love and sexual experimentation, struggles with unworthy pathetic parental figures and alienation from a school milieu consisting of people who would have been kicked out of the Hitler Youth for being too evil. Usually salvation comes in the form of some other outcast world, ridiculed by the contemptible ""normals"", where a father/mother figure can be found who will guide them to eventual, though not pain-free, self-realisation.It is one of the 100 clichés of cinema, somewhere between the man who has lost everything and sets out for bloody revenge and the family wedding where everything that can go wrong will go wrong. But as with all genre projects, it is the execution that counts more than any originality, and so it is with ""The Way Way Back""The title comes from the position our angsty youth, 14 yr old Duncan (Liam James) has in the old Buick station wagon his prospective step- father Trent (Steve Carrell) drives as he and his divorced mother Pam (Toni Collette) and Trent's bitchy 16 yr old daughter Steph (Zoe Levin) drive for their annual summer break at a seaside resort. He sits at the back facing the rear (for which presumably a classic car was chosen as modern SUVS all face front) a clumsy but effective metaphor for his alienation not only from the world but also within the newly forming family unit that seems to be tearing his mother away from him. At the resort he meets their regular summer neighbour Betty (Alison Janney) a happy gay spirited eternal teenager who is also a raging alcoholic and her serious, often disgusted daughter Susanna (Annasophia Robb) and her lazy eyed cynical younger brother Peter (River Alexander). Also there for the summer are Trent's friends Kip (Rob Corddry) and his hot but sluttish wife Joan (Amanda Peet) both of who seem even more adolescent and maturity proof than Betty. The grown-ups acting like teenagers and the teenagers acting like grown-up is the mirror world joke here. Spurned by Steph and her cliché and unable to impress Susanna (for whom he has the hots) he falls in with another eternal teenager, Owen (Sam Rockwell) manager of Water Whizz, an 80s vintage water park where he discovers his true worth and becomes one of the team, unbeknown to his adult guardians. As he discovers joy, happiness and self-worth for the first time, fractures begin to appear in the ""adult party"", where an old relationship between Trent and Joan threatens the stability of the newly forming family, and a budding relationship begins with Susanna. When he finally leaves to go back home, sitting way way back, Duncan will not be the same person that first arrived.The writing and direction is spot on, coming as it does from the team of actor-directors Nat Faxon and Jim Rash, who also award themselves juicy roles as Owen's comedy sidekicks at Water Whizz, and is a fine companion piece to the similarly themed ""Little Miss Sunshine"" and ""Juno"". Like last years ""Moonrise Kingdom"", it walks a fine but delicate line between being a film about adolescence for adults and being an actual ""kids"" film, both taking the limited and overly romantic world view of the teenage protagonists which would also presumably be the one of a juvenile audience. (The adult audience would of course understand the hinted but hidden nature of the adult drama that might escape the younger viewer as often occurs in such stories.) As such it is a great movie for both generations. Acting wise, the film boasts a literal top-draw of indie acting talent that alone makes it worth seeing. Carrell is great in another ""unlikeable guy who is really not all that bad beneath"" role following ""Burt Wonderstone"" and I suspect he is attempting to position himself into such roles as middle age sets in. Muriel herself Toni Collette is also fantastic as another, though older, love lorn character who is trying to balance past pains, future prospects, growing fear and the happiness of her growing son. The scene where a children's board game pulled out on a tense wet afternoon becomes a smouldering confrontation about Trent and Joan's ""friendship"" is her finest hour. Janney, Robb and Peet are also wonderful as the overgrown kids, likable and fun yet also rather pathetic, especially given the emotional neglect of their own old before their years children. Sam Rockwell, one of the finest comic actors of his generation, excels as the wise cracking Water Whizz owner, a sort of edgy Willy Wonka and the kind of guy any kid would love to have as a father figure. Rockwell seems to play him as an extended impersonation of his ""Iron Man 2"" rival Robert Downey Jr (Seriously! Watch it and see what I mean) which may either be how he is or an affectation of his character, who we see has his own issues and darkness to deal with beneath the façade. Maya Rudolph is also great as his despairing grown up girlfriend, visibly pregnant but hoping no one will notice. The younger stars are also brilliant, not least Liam James who has to carry the whole movie and does so excellently.Hardly original and no great game changing masterpiece, it's still good clean fun that can be enjoyed earnestly by all ages, a winning mix of comedy and drama that will leave you feeling better as you walk out.",The Way Way Back

Nothing about this movie is remotely relatable or believable yet everything is super predictable.It just a big pile of nothing and I didn't get any enjoyment from watching this terribly boring movie. It's also very unrealistic and anything can happen in this though.

101,YJLcool,"Another remarkable, satisfying coming-of-age drama film",8,15 November 2013,"The Way Way Back is a remarkable, satisfying coming-of-age drama film about a 'wallflower', Duncan gradually finds his way in life, overcome his lack of confidence and learn some important life lessons by a cool water park manager and a nice girl who approaches and shows him the meaning of life and reveal his inner potential as a person. Despite its familiar themes (a nice woman falls in love with a nasty jerk for some weird reason, a nice girl appears to provide comfort, etc), the film manage to create an impact by showing characters you can somehow relate to and let you empathize with them. There are many moments or scenes in the film that you might have experienced yourself in life. The film done a great job in conveying the underlying themes throughout the entire film - There's no sets of definitive 'patterns' and 'rules' in life that you have to follow...life is a journey, you got to find your own way, a path that you never regret. Sometimes, life's seemingly insignificant moments are the ones that truly makes you happy and contented. But keep in mind that in real life, there won't be a nice attractive girl come looking to provide you solace (If there is, you're damn lucky). Overall, this film is very familiar with another brilliant coming-of-age drama, The Perks of being a Wallflower but still wonderful in its own way.

102,quiqueperezsoler,Formulaic but not cliched. Romanticised yet relatable. A refreshing 80s-vibed summer coming of age tale,9,26 May 2020,"While at times predictable, the movie had something to say and the formulaic summer coming of age plot is enhanced by great performances specially the brilliant Sam Rockwell whose well fleshed out role brings the best of his charisma in an otherwise pretty standard family drama.Highlights are definitely, as everyone has said already, Sam Rockwell whose witty line deliveries are only enhanced by his charismatic and well-performed role. The mentor relationship between him and the main lead. The humor in the movie is easy-going but fun and amusing. It doesn't clash with the more dramatic main plot (waiting to explode as with every movie of the kind). Also most of the characters in the water park and on the neighbor's family are charismatically varied and entertaining. Allison Janney is wonderfully quirky, her dorky son is unique and makes you wish he had more to do and the daughter is different from the bland-love-interest-cliche, she has a role to play and she does so greatly, it's a bummer for the love story though. A bit poorly written because it hardly ever gave them enough screen time to express their feelings more trying to leave it ambiguous.And the approach at the ""evil stepdad"" is, while at times hammy and mean for the sake of being mean, it finds a way to work it in the story with a regretful attitude but where the movie could have stick to the different ending it was building on with a distinct message of conformity it regrets it in the last second and it doesn't feel natural. And that is something that is prevalent throughout the film, there are themes that draw from the formulaic structure of these sort of summer coming of age movies but what's refreshing about it are the shying away from them in many of its plot points.The only big issues I have are that one scene of the romantic subplot with Anna Sophia Robb's character, it is a sweet summer fling where two teens feel a connection and that one important milestone is interrupted by bad timing, but it isn't. It unravels very naturally and has very good heartfelt moments but a certain plot point feels incoherent with the natural progression of it and comes across as a gimmick to subvert expectations or to ""break out of the formula"". But it does so unsuccessfully. And it is unfortunate because the couple is doing an incredible job is just that in that plot point the significant milestone concludes oddly just to add to the already dramatic climax of the film. It feels betraying to the essence of their relationship and in the end of the movie doesn't feel fulfilling, only adds more questions to the true feelings both of them really had between each other, specially of one of them.Minor issues are the unsuiting stepdad role for Steve Carrell, but this might just be personal preference, he's gotten to be known by his absurd comedic and dumb but kind-hearted roles in The Office and The 40 year old virgin. The other minor issue is the caricaturesque performances by the ""popular girls"" featuring the main lead's stepsister, in an otherwise pretty well-realised setting and characters she is the one that comes across a bit over the top. As goes with the main lead who is meant to come across as shy but takes it a bit too far but not too much as to feel exaggerated, overall he delivers a great performance, if any the issues might be with the writting of his character.The last minor issue is that at the beginning the shy boy had to be cushioned by the supporting characters in order to give a sense of progression in the plot and that could be tiresome to some, but that is expected from movies that feature a shy kid. Like, Anne Sophia's character can come across as paying too much attention to the shy kid who never gives reasons to engage in conversation but as mentioned before, it's the formula of this movies, to make the rest of the characters bring out any conversation of the main lead which only makes the audience feel more frustrated with the kid instead of laughing at the situation or intrusive questions. However, the conclusion of the movie, coming full-circle with themes presented at the beginning but with characters that have grown with the past events is uplifting and wholesome. The film simply screams fun above all, and screams at the norms and conformities found in unwanted situations. Only some of them are not concluded as successfully as they could have, but properly concluded nonethelessIN CONCLUSION, the movie is a basic summer coming of age movie with great performances, a feel-good water park support crew dynamic, uplifting relationships and interactions and your well-known family drama with a shy kid breaking out of his shell. The biggest highlights are Sam Rockwell's quips and interactions with the main lead, the charismatic supporting characters, the refreshing takes at stepfamilies and an addition to the amusing american summer crazy partying and household issues that bring about repressed feelings. A well acted coming of age movie but not a ground-breaking one, highly recommended as a summer flick. I saw this in winter and it wasn't the same",The Way Way Back
103,iranu-74195,Pacing and cast eventually settle down into a great little movie,7,22 January 2021,"Camera, lighting all good. Early on, there was some danger of overacting by the young male lead- but that was the fault of the Director not assisting a young actor. Some of the adults could have reigned it in, a bit, and not rush through the script. Eventually, the cast calms down and the story starts to breath into an inventive and beautifully funny coming of age movie. This film is 2013 - so how strange to see the start of mobile phone dependence.Rockwell and the Lad have the smart lines and the neat scenes and they deliver them well, even if the end does get touched with some schmaltz. Strange that Carell can get cast, sometimes, as a Mr normal with underlying nastiness - perhaps that says more about Carell than should be discussed. However, I could do without his face in movies, for awhile, thanks. But, the movie is bigger than Carell and by the end you realise you've caught a real gem. Certainly worth the time.",The Way Way Back
104,cleary-joshua,"Growing up is a theme which has been tackled countless times, but not like this...",9,23 October 2013,"Growing up is a theme which has been tackled countless times on the silver screen, and in tonnes of different ways. On the surface, ""The Way, Way Back"" is a fairly ordinary take on it. A boy is staying at the summer-house of his mum's new boyfriend. He dislikes the 'new father' and his teenage daughter, and feels like he doesn't really fit in. He has a crush on the girl-next-door, and eventually gets a secret job, where his boss becomes a father-figure/mentor to him. In a basic synopsis, it's nothing special, and could move into the realm of cliché. What is it then that makes ""The Way, Way Back"" so special, and one of the best films in this genre? Two things – the writing, and the performances.It's written by Nat Faxon and Jim Rash, who previously worked on ""The Descendants"" with Alexander Payne, and is full of hilarious moments and fantastic characters. The film has a real sense of nostalgia to it, helped by the stuck-in-the-past water park which features heavily. The pair write fantastic sequences and dialogues, including the dance sequence near the beginning and party scene at the end. However, these are both scenes which are livened up even more by fantastic acting, especially from relative-newcomer Liam James.In the rest of the cast, there are three standout performances, which I can't imagine being absent from the film. Sam Rockwell's laid-back manager, Owen, delivers some of the best lines in the film, especially the ""Holding out for a Hero"" speech, and it is occasionally the delivery itself which makes the lines so hilarious. It is really refreshing to see Steve Carrell doing something completely new in this film – playing the bad guy. Carrell always lands the good guys, or the characters your feel sorry for. Here, he's dislikable and quite horrible to Duncan, and Carrell's performance ensures that you loath him just like Duncan does. The best performance in the film comes from Allison Janney, who plays the constantly-drinking, inappropriate Betty, mother of Duncan's love interest. Many scenes are completely livened up by her presence, and you occasionally laugh at just how inappropriate she manages to be – the 'lazy eye' jokes are some of the best in the film.I don't disagree at all that ""The Way, Way Back"" is occasionally clichéd and pretty predictable at times, but it draws you in, making you relate to the characters so much. I also don't remember laughing so much at the cinema as I did while watching it.",The Way Way Back

I enjoyed this film, the experience of watching it, the joy of the performers and performances (Janney is clearly having a blast), the occasional flourish in filmmaking, and the more than occasional burst of wit from the script. And that sense of sheer enjoyment places this ahead of most of what American movies circa summer 2013 have offered so far. When it comes right down to it, this is a well executed coming-of-age picture with no pretensions toward anything greater. Even the saggier moments are buoyed by this-it must be said again-stellar cast. And any film that gives Sam Rockwell a plum role like this deserves a look.",The Way Way Back

Alison Janney is fantastic as the loving, honest if detestable mother who adores her kids and inspires them to have confidence.

After lulled to sleep twice, I was finally able to stay alert for this drowsy tale of teenage angst and adult irresponsibility. This premise is more interesting than the final product. The judgment of whomever suggested ""hey, wouldn't Carrell be perfect for this role"" is called into question. Prolific comedy careers have been destroyed for lesser offenses. The highlight here is surely Sam Rockwell who plays a nev'r- do-well lovable misfit type who manages a water park and befriends our young protagonist. He becomes an accidental muse to the disheartened teen and lightens the mood of an otherwise dreary movie experience. I can trudge through a film and not feel cheated so long as there was at least a nugget of entertainment or intellectual value within it.

I really liked this movie even though it was aimed at a much younger audience then yours truly. It is a nice little slice of life and coming of age picture that many early teenagers can identify with. Duncan, the 14 year old main character, has to spend his summer at a beach community with his less then supportive mom and her not so nice boyfriend. It is the boyfriends' beach house and he has been going there for years so has a large group of folks for Duncan and his mom to get approved by. The teenage b*%ch girls on the beach are just the beginning for Duncan and he very soon finds he has no friends there, including his mom who does not want to loose her chance with the boyfriend so does not stick up for Duncan in any way. Duncan soon meets and is befriended by the staff at the water park and he soon works his days there without his mothers knowledge. The water park manager is an offbeat character who is the one supportive person in Duncan's life. Duncan soon learns to stand up for himself and has a blast along the way. Stand-outs in this movie are Steve Carell in his first role as a bad guy, Allison Janney as the man-chasing, heavy-drinking neighbour and Sam Rockwell as the water park manager. Liam James as Duncan is one to watch as this young man will go far.",The Way Way Back
111,repete52,The BEST!,10,22 January 2021,"The Way, Way Back is a Classic! This is just the greatest flick (well, not THE greatest, cuz there is no such thing, there is always a Group of movies, cars, flowers, etc which comprise ""among the greatest"", ""a group of the best"", etc).
It HAS to be seen more than once.
I don't understand when folks say, ""There is nothing to not like about this movie"", or, ""This show has everything"", or, ""The acting is superb, the story is fantastic"", etc, etc, then give it a 9 or an 8 or less. With the listed qualities, it rightfully deserves a 10!
A movie does not need to have a cast-of-thousands, nor a billion dollar budget, nor an extravagant musical score to be ""great"". In fact, many of those that have, have been so-so or stinkers.
The Way, Way Back has pathos, emotion, great acting, great story... It's a 10!!",The Way Way Back

All the actors played their parts to perfection. Who would've guessed that Steve Carrel could play such a douche? Toni Colette is great as the insecure mom who loves her son, but is torn between him and ""Trent"". (Toni has a knack for these roles requiring depth - see ""Muriels Wedding"") Sam Rockwell is perfect as the not-yet completely grown-up mentor.The plot and pacing is just perfect. This gives the movie a feeling of believability, while being funny and captivating. There are no unnecessary jokes or violence. No silly special effects.

An able cast make the most of a good script, fleshing out the characters and deepening the relationships. Allison Janney bursts into the movie after a couple of scenes giving life to a slightly over-written character, but generally characters are believable. What makes this movie a little bit special, is it's focus on the trans-formative power, not of an 'Endless Summer', teen love affair, first sexual awakenings etc, but of the relationship between the boy and the man who becomes his friend and helps him find his way. A running theme in the script seems to be bullying in it's many forms and our willingness to acquiesce to it. If it takes confidence to stand up for oneself and others, how much easier must that be, when one feels liked, valued and important to others.",The Way Way Back

What a fine actor he is, with his goofy appearance and hilarious lines, while he seems the only adult with the time or sensitivity to feel the growing pains of an adorable 14 year old boy.Male, female, young or old, you'll see yourself in some of the scenes, and maybe be lucky enough to remember someone like Owen of the Water Wizz water park who helped you find yourself and not take yourself too seriously when you were coming of age.The movie doesn't try too hard to be more than it is, and in so doing it hits the mark so perfectly.

No talented kids in Hollywood anymore?! He reuins the whole movie. The plot is fine, it's him I couldn't bear for a minute. So cold, lame with very poor performance. I am also sorry to say this since I don't judge looks or whatsoever, but he looks like he just hit puberty in this movie! He is sweaty, disgusting shape and useless.

I felt like the scenes that were supposed to be dramatic just fell flat. The actors are incredible, and their performances were great, but it just felt unnatural and too contrived and so it just kind of left you feeling like it should've been more. The comedy scenes were slightly amusing but not really all that funny, with the exception of ""and we're holding."" I loved Sam Rockwell's character who I thought was the only character who really stood out and was a lot of fun, but there was no character journey for him, or for that matter for any other character in the film. They try to trick you into the main character had a personal journey, but he didn't he stayed the same, he just found people who accepted him that way. Steve Carell did great, but all the way through the film he was so intolerable it was miserable to watch scenes with him. AnnaSophia Robb was in it. I LOVE Annasophia Robb. She is beautiful, funny, and VERY talented, but her role in this particular film was bland, and really very expendable. So, I don't know, it felt like it was a wanna-be indie film. It was an enjoyable one time view but it's nothing special.",The Way Way Back

Something popped into my mind. Back in the 70's when Donnie and Marie Osmond were teen stars, I remember a show where Marie called Donnie ""numb nuts."" This was obviously scripted and approved, and was the most naughty and sexual thing they ever said or did ever. Marie was all giggles. This was her approved for television teen rebellion at Mormon authority.Why did I think of that? Well, the most naughty and sexual thing in this movie was when Owen gave Duncan a swim suit to wear and told him that the mesh lining was missing and wearing them was basically going ""commando."" And then for the rest of the movie it looked like Duncan was wearing winter clothes. No skin for him or Susanna, the 2 hot bodies, for the whole movie. Plus as others have said, no plot, no interesting characters, etc.So this is an ""SG"" (Super G) rated movie for the religious right wing who think pablum is worthy of an Academy Award.

He plays one of the most lovable characters I've ever seen in cinema. He's funny, relatable, immature but mature at the same, and he's the type of friend and father figure we all needed at some point in our lives. In a seemingly underrated career, this is another great performance by Rockwell, one that is sure to make you laugh out loud on multiple occasions.",The Way Way Back

It's a movie about that one summer of your life that you'll remember forever. I loved the emotions brought out in this movie. I remembered being that 14 year old kid (although I'm a girl) . I was taken back to my days on summer vacations when the kids were left in the ""camp"" all day while the parents played. Same feelings, same struggles, and then you meet that one ""grown-up"" person in your life who gets it , gets you, and makes you know everything is going to be OK. I loved Steve Carrell playing a total jerk, the bad guy in the movie... a type of role I have not seen him play before. i didn't like him. And I liked that I didn't like him! Sam Rockwell... what a bonus for me. I didn't know he was in this movie and I always love him. He's just so good at whatever character he plays. Wow is all I can say! Good characters and situations throughout. The whole summertime beach setting, very alluring. Pulls you right in. I love the ending when he must say goodbye (*sniffle*) and I appreciated the very last scene when I finally got why the movie was called the Way, Way back.

Well, we don't have to worry about that however I was surprised by the amount of positive reviews listed here. I went through the first three or four ages and read only one negative review. Well, here's another one! I gave the film a four because the acting was good and Sam Rockwell stole the film with his performance.The problem I had was that I did not emotionally connect with any of the characters nor the story and found the film predictable and not all that interesting. Based on the reviews I read, I expected something special and got an ordinary story I've seen many times. I could have turned the film off at any point without feeling that I was missing anything. The comedy portion was lacking and the drama was very plain. I think there have been so many poor films released that a so-so film has become more than it would normally be. I'm sure most people will disagree with me, but I had to include my two cents.",The Way Way Back
125,tanstorck,A comedy with the perfect amount of drama,8,12 October 2018,"The film started as a somewhat silly comedy but the comedy improved and the story started to become more tense and serious. The film managed to be a comedy with plenty of drama to keep the story going.
 
All the acting in the film is great. Some of the actors are hilarious and others are extremely realistic. Specifically, the lead actor who played Duncan had one of the most realistic portrayals of a shy teenager. The family also seemed accurate to the situation. The family members, neighbors and waterpark employees were very funny and entertaining. Although some of the story was a bit predictable, it was heartwarming and seemed (for the most part) very realistic.If you want to laugh and maybe cry a little bit on a long summer journey, this is the film to watch!",The Way Way Back
126,politically_incorrect204,Relatable and Pleasant,10,3 January 2014,"I realize a 10 out of 10 is generous and not what everyone would go this film. And I admit I'm suckered by the underdog story of a kid who feels like he doesn't belong and can't relate to a lot of other kids his age largely because I can relate to elements of that even though i wasn't quite as awkward or outsiderish as this kid. Movies like this or Kings of Summer speak to themes that mean a lot to me and my nostalgia of being a care free kid again. Anyways, all that aside I do feel the film is quite solid. It's equal parts depressing and uplifting. It's more depressing initially but then later is uplifting. Some complain it's a bit too by the numbers or happy ending feeling at the end but for all the crap the kid put up with his step dad and step sibling I think it's nice to give him some sunshine. Beyond the story line ending a little too positively for some the acting and character development are definitely great. Allison Janney is hilarious in this film and aside from that all starring roles and supporting ones are done really well. You find yourself really believing and feeling for the characters like Owen, Duncan, his Mom, etc. For myself I really enjoyed it even if it's not actually perfect. But for the kind of movie it is I do feel it is perfect. It's exactly the kind of ride I want to see. Frankly for people saying it's too sunny I think it's actually a bit overly depressing at first. His step father is so horrible to him (short of abuse that is) that you wish he had some sunny moments earlier in the film. I guess in that sense I wish the film would have been a bit more balanced as opposed to all depressing initially and nearly all uplifting at the end. Regardless an enjoyable ride nonetheless!",The Way Way Back
127,sugarnspices,The Way Way overly Hollywood BS,2,9 July 2016,"I rated this movie a 2 out of 10. It had a few funny scenes thanks to Allison J., but even her character was over the top and never turned off. That was my main ""problem"" with this movie was all the over the top/extreme personalities of just about every character. Nobody is like this in real life, all the time. Now let me go into the most ""oh come on already"" characters of this extreme Hollywood wanna be Indie, deep movie. The kid, Duncan. This kid made me feel so uncomfortable the entire time. From his dark purple lips and bleached out skin, to his long unnatural arms with huge hands and head. Now not trying to be mean, but I thought he had some kind of giantism and was autistic, had to come to trust my IMDb and read his page to find out I was wrong. He crossed the ""shy, finding himself"" feel to plain old creepy and mentally disabled. Couldn't relate with him at all other than feeling sorry for him by the way every one ""treated"" him and completely ignored him. Which brings me to the mother..Toni Collete. I love her. Always have. But I've never been so disgusted with a female character in my life. Just completely ignoring and watching some boyfriend completely ridicule and put down your obviously different son, non-stop, everywhere was just completely annoying and angering. Yes, let's strap on a HUGE red life vest on this kid with a whole group of people, but he is the ONLY one that has to wear it because your boyfriend said so. And on top of that, let's ALL just completely ignore the fact the kid is sitting in the shade by himself looking like he is about to kill himself, and all just laugh and have a good old time, only glancing over and showing some kind of ""aw"" once in awhile, but go right back to the group fun! What a great mom!!! If I were that kid I would have told her to shove it up where the sun don't shine and never speak to her again. That kind of mental abuse is not funny or she just needed to see it herself and figure it out. No. She needed to be slapped in the face and take her mom card away. Oh but she climbs in the ""way way back"" at the end and give him the ""op, sorry I was the worst mother alive for the last few weeks, putting some strange man before you repeadtly in front of everyone, but I look sorry so we are good, right? Cool."" NO. Steve C. played the a-hole bf OK, at first. It got to a point of just ridiculousness and unreal by the end. The kid breaks out of the car to sprint to the water park last minute, shocking, and they go in to find him and Steve yells ""What are we doing here, c'mon!!!"" Yes, like he is expecting everyone to be like ""oh, he is in the water park..he likes it there, who's hungry, let's just keep going."" Over the top, unrealistic and annoying. Like most the movie. Brings me to pretty much every character from the water park. Annoying, annoying, over the top, unrealistic and did I say annoying?? The gross water slide guy and his 1 minute way too long of ""hold it, still holding"" annoyance was so stupid. Yes some 40 something year old creep is going to keep some teenage girl standing here as all 3 of them obviously stare at her body is OK and like she wouldn't notice and become skeeved out and leave. Disgusting. Sam R.'s character was the typical, laid back, don't care, super cool, can eff off all summer and in life, but not until the girl he likes puts him in his place in a random 5 second scene, was all he needed to start growing up and be a man. And don't get me started with the dancing scene at the water park. ""You can have the cardboard, but you gotta dance for it"" as they all stand around and clap and support his autistic awkward dancing, and don't forget the girl showing him all those rocking moves such as the robot! You know kids just LOVE the robot, it's just so cool!!! Barf. This movie was cute-ish, and had some good humor, but overall was a typical Hollywood script you could call 10 minutes before it happen and was beyond corny and campy and everything I can't stand in a movie.",The Way Way Back

129,zombiebird,Good,6,9 October 2013,"Pretty much your standard coming-of-age movie; isolated teenager with a troubled family life finds comfort and friendship with an outside parental figure. It's well done all around with good performances and really flawed parental characters that make you buy into the story more than if it was just the pretense of bad parenting. The ending too is very satisfying, I was afraid it would end in a cheesy everything-is-right-in- the-world-now sort of way, but the ending suited the plot and the story nicely. The 1 downside to the whole thing however was the character of Owen, he is just so exaggerated and unrealistically over the top that, to some extent, he pulls the seriousness and plausibility out of the story. In-spite of that, it's still a good movie, and better than most of the others in the same genre. In short, you'll like this if you like coming- of-age dramas.",The Way Way Back

131,kr98664,Split Decision,5,14 October 2013,"My wife and sister (two separate people, just so there's no confusion) loved this movie. I was a bit more ambivalent. Much of it was on the depressing side. Plus, there were a few glaring plot holes, such as how Duncan could spend so much time away without having to explain it. On the plus side, Steve Carell did a good job playing an unlikable character. Sam Rockwell, as usual, played his borderline crazy role very well. I especially liked the way he stood up for Duncan, his young charge. The script did a good job playing up the whole aspect of crazy home life = bad, versus crazy work life = good. In the end, though, I think the movie was just a little too much on the down side. I know 14 is an awkward age, but it probably would have helped if Duncan had been portrayed as not so sullen. I found myself starting to agree with the stepfather's assessment of him, and that's not a good sign about the movie's main character.",The Way Way Back
132,thealphakeno,Perfection is the word!,10,9 October 2013,"It's no doubt that this film echoes the movie of 'The Perks of Being a Wallflower' in some ways. That's what I've thought after watching the trailer and apparently, it is. It's a movie that you can watch all over again, there is no dead scene like most of the movie and the mixed comedy and drama get along well throughout the film.The actors in portray the characters really well. The guy who plays Duncan, (Liam James) was a great choice of portraying an awkward, shy kid. He fits for the role and he bring all emotion in every scene he's with. He can dance like a loser. He can transform into a cool kid. He can be too awkward that you feel embarrassed on your own while watching it, and he can step up and deliver a dramatic intense line. This guy can do anything!Steve Carell as a mean step-father is new for me because I always see him as a funny guy. Allison Janney was fantastic; I burst to laugh to all of her scene. AnnaSophia Rob did well too but I felt the disconnection of her character, maybe because it didn't focus on her at all. Sam Rockwell, ROCKS! Portraying a cool, chilling dude with a fatherly heart blows me away. He always portrays villain character but not in this one, he proves it when he defends Duncan (Liam James) from Trent (Steve Carell).Overall, I rated it 10/10, perfect, excellent and extraordinary film that must to be watch.

134,sahamh,A Fun and Cute Dramedy,7,19 August 2013,"Written and directed by Nat Faxon and Jim Rash, they previously worked on The Descendant, but this time they got chance also to direct a film together.The story is about a 14-year old boy going to a summer house with his mother and her jerk boyfriend and bitch daughter of the boyfriend. Right out of the bat, you get the sense how the relationship of Trent (Steve Carell) and Duncan (Laim James) is in the prologue scene, you immediately feel sorry for Duncan and you support him, even though he's awkward, but you root for him. Then more likable supporting characters show up, and Duncan goes through more frustration and loneliness, but he finds a place to escape and comfort himself. Indeed the story doesn't sound something fresh, but the characters and the dramatic situations are very realistic and a lot of people have experienced or observed someone like Duncan what he goes through in their teenage time. In my opinion, there are a lot of funny and sweet moments, and obviously there are some sad moments, and all these moments are done perfectly and brought by great performances. Steve Carrel, this is definitely something new in his career, a total mean and selfish person and he does this role very well; Toni Collette, what a sexy woman and talented actress, I don't understand why she doesn't get bigger roles in feature films; Allison Janney, WONDERFUL, she's absolutely great in this film, very sexy and funny – I loved her so much; Sam Rockwell, I don't know what is about him, he's always funny and charming in this kind of roles, and at the same time not being repetitive, he's such a underrated and unique actor; AnnaSophia Robb, my god, with the beauty she has, she must get a lot of offers in the future , but I seriously hope she makes the right decisions because in my opinion she's got a talent to be a real star; and finally Liam James, I think he's done a great job, I'm very jealous honestly, because working with such a talented cast like this is the biggest learning experience for a new starter. However I have a few problems, one would be the relationship between Sam Rockwell and Maya Rudalph, it doesn't have a chemistry to make any impacts to the story, and another one is Rob Corddry's character, he's a very funny actor but nothing would have been changed without him, which I feel like his role could do more in the third act, but I can be wrong. Indeed, these are the supporting characters, but they're likable characters, you feel they needed to have some effects to the story, not just being there for filling the space or a few jokes.In conclusion, I recommend this; I myself will buy the DVD and check out the extra BTS materials, I give it 7.5/10.",The Way Way Back
135,bill_golden,Disappointing to say the least,4,7 November 2016,"My sentiments largely echo those of the previous (chronological) review, although I'll bump my rating up a bit to four (4) stars. What a disappointing screenplay. The premise, while unoriginal, at least gave me the hope this would be something worth watching, even though I'm way beyond the target demographic. Liam James plays an introverted 14- year-old trying to blend into the beach town environment his family is visiting for a week or two. I could never quite figure out where this town was, whether it was on a lake or at the Jersey shore, or what. He winds up getting a job at the local water park which becomes his ""home away from home"". His family situation is dysfunctional, his mom's boyfriend (Steve Carell) is an overbearing jerk and most of the girls he encounters in their entourage won't give him the time of day. At the end of the two hours (I watched this on Fox Movie Channel) I found myself wishing I hadn't wasted the time. There wasn't a single character that seemed original or even very appealing. I can't say I was much impressed with Liam James' performance but he wasn't the only one. What is Maya Rudolph doing in this, or I could say why would someone cast her in such a role? You better look quick or you'll miss Amanda Peet in a very small, thankless role with hardly any lines. Toni Collette made no impression on me as Liam James' mother. The main guys at the water park were a bit odd, but not very interesting. Who wears hats like Sam Rockwell's anymore? Allison Janney attempted to breathe some life into the proceedings without much success. To conclude, at the end of the day, the movie couldn't figure out exactly what it wanted to be and I found it lacking in most every regard: Too bland, too clichéd, and too much miscasting.",The Way Way Back
136,Melissaslist,Truly Awful,1,20 April 2014,"It is rare that I will watch a bad movie from beginning to end if i'm in my home (if i'm in the theater I figured I paid my money and should see it through). I watched the first few minutes and thought it was extremely boring and unfunny, uninteresting but gave it a chance to get batter even though I knew it wouldn't. I have a 5 minute rule for movies; if they don't draw you in in the first 5 minutes (which one would think the creators of the story would pay closest attention to) what are the odds the rest of the film will get better? This rule has pretty much held true for every good/bad film I've ever seen. IMHO rarely does a film start out bad and then get good. First; I'm stumped as to why they used songs from the 80's (REO speedwagon...) to create a sort of theme of this time period? If they wanted to make this film in a different time period then they should have done that. It seems like they wanted it to have that feel but have it take place in present day. I also sensed that the man the boy befriended (forget his name) was supposed to be a sort of Bill Murray/Meatballs type; slacker, but heart of gold with lots of wisdom to teach a nerdy kid who doesn't fit in. Meatballs was far more effective and an infinitely better movie. I also hated the Steve Carrell character. I suppose that was intended. He plays a very convincing ahole which makes me wonder if he really is. I felt extremely uncomfortable watching him be so cruel towards his girlfriends son; calling him a ""3"" and then calling him ""buddy"" as he ordered him around like a slave and demoralized him. I'm not suggesting this doesn't happen in the real world, but I could not understand why the boys mom did nothing about it. It made no sense. She was smart, educated, had a career...so how could she be so clueless about her own son and allow him to be treated with such blatant disrespect? The story was predictable and you knew that his new friendship with the Bill Murray dude and the others at the water park was going to enable him for the first time in his life to feel like he was part of something and give him a sense of pride and then in the very end his mom would finally SEE him and be proud and finally be on his side.

It is a nice little slice of life and coming of age picture that many early teenagers can identify with. Duncan, the 14 year old main character, has to spend his summer at a beach community with his less then supportive mom and her not so nice boyfriend. It is the boyfriends' beach house and he has been going there for years so has a large group of folks for Duncan and his mom to get approved by. The teenage b*%ch girls on the beach are just the beginning for Duncan and he very soon finds he has no friends there, including his mom who does not want to loose her chance with the boyfriend so does not stick up for Duncan in any way. Duncan soon meets and is befriended by the staff at the water park and he soon works his days there without his mothers knowledge. The water park manager is an offbeat character who is the one supportive person in Duncan's life. Duncan soon learns to stand up for himself and has a blast along the way. Stand-outs in this movie are Steve Carell in his first role as a bad guy, Allison Janney as the man-chasing, heavy-drinking neighbour and Sam Rockwell as the water park manager. Liam James as Duncan is one to watch as this young man will go far.",The Way Way Back

140,filmguyCI,"High Expectations, Very Disappointed",4,21 July 2013,"When I heard about this film, it became a must see. The creators of Little Miss Sunshine? Steve Carrell and Toni Collette? A feel good coming of age story? What would not be to like? Basic plot, a 14 year old boy spends the summer with his mother (Toni Collette) and her obnoxious boyfriend (Steve Carrell) at his beach house. In order to escape his misery, he gets a job at a local water park where Owen (Sam Rockwell), the outrageous water park manager with a big heart takes him under his wing and helps him out of his shell. The plot is a lot like ""Meatballs,"" one of my favorite films of the 70s. That may have been the problem for me. Sam Rockwell's characterization is so much like Bill Murray's that he should be arrested for stealing a performance. The young boy portraying Duncan completely overplays the role. Duncan is so socially withdrawn and awkward that one would think that there was some level of autism going on. I found it hard to warm up to this character.Plot holes run through the whole movie. We are to believe that Duncan is working every day at this water park and his mother doesn't even question where he is. When Owen, a grown man, drives him home for the first time, his mother casually questions ""who is this friend of yours who drives?"" and doesn't say another word about it.There are other characters and plot lines that are never fully developed. Maya Rudolph plays Owen's boss. The two had a relationship that went south. This is mentioned in one scene and never explored further despite the fact that there seemed to be ongoing feeling between the two. There is also an ongoing joke about a neighborhood kid with a lazy eye that becomes a running gag despite it not being particularly funny.I'm not getting all the glowing reviews. Maybe my expectations were too high. But another ""Little Miss Sunshine"" this is definitely not.",The Way Way Back
141,DangerAwesome,"You owe it to your 14 year old self to see ""The Way Way Back""",7,11 October 2013,"""The Way Way Back"" is a simple story with good acting and characters with realistic depth. Steve Carrell breaks his typical mold and plays a jerk, and does a great job with it. Sam Rockwell was also amazing.Duncan (James) is your standard 14 year old who seems to have nothing going for him. His family and their friends range from annoying to jerks. The adults think that he and the other boy Peter should be friends and play together, despite the fact that Duncan is 14 and Peter's 10. The adults not seeming to realize the huge age gap. The same thing used to happen to me at every family function. I think many of us remember being the oldest kid at the ""kids table"". It's that kind of stuff that makes the movie so relatable.The film does a nice job of seeming like it could be set in any beach town, in almost any time in the last 40 years. One reason for that being that it contains almost no pop culture or modern music references. It's that type of thing that is going to make this film age well. However it's also why this movie speaks not only to 14 year olds of this day, but to anyone and their memory of what being 14 was like.I'd recommend The Way Way Back to anyone who struggled at that age. Anyone who wasn't super popular. Or anyone who had a place like working at a water park that they liked being at more than at home.",The Way Way Back
142,imdb-783-507847,Brilliant indie comedy drama,9,14 September 2013,"The Review: The way, way back revolves around a 14 year old boy called Duncan who is holidaying with his mother (Toni Collette) and her new over bearing boyfriend played by Steve Carell and his bitchy daughter.Feeling detached from his family and having to endure their eccentric alcoholic neighbour played by Alison Janney and her one eyed son, Duncan secretly flees his holiday home to take solace in a local water park.This brilliant indie comedy drama marks the directorial debuts of duo Nat Faxon and Jim Rash who co-wrote the outstanding Alexander Payne movie The Descendants.The film wastes little time in creating some excellent scenes as we are introduced to the central character and his relationship with his mother's cruel and insensitive boyfriend. The opening scene with them in the car paints a clear picture of just how insecure Duncan feels and how he has no adult role model to support him.As Duncan later flees to a local water park he meets the charismatic but unprofessional park manager Owen played by Sam Rockwell. Owen immediately takes Duncan under his wing and attempts to bring out the best in him whilst simultaneously infuriating his co-workers who brand him as an incompetent manager.Sam Rockwell has never been more charismatic and funny in his delivery. His character is someone you would love to hang out with and have fight your corner but at the same time you know you would be at your most unproductive when spending any time with him.As Duncan spends more time at the water park we see his character change, gaining more and more confidence enabling him to challenge the people in his holiday home who are making his life miserable.All of the cast deliver exceptional performances in a film that delivers a perfect balance of laughs and genuinely touching moments and drama.There are inevitable comparisons to Adventureland starring Jesse Eisenberg but this film more than matches that film as a quality coming of age story.The direction is very unflashy but the pacing is perfect, relying on the brilliant script and performances from the cast.It was also great to see Steve Carell playing a very unlikeable character, showing that he has a great range if given the right material.Overall if you are looking for a film that will put a huge smile on your face and present you with characters that you would happily hang out with in real life then this is a film I urge you to check out.For more check out www.thefilmpodcast.co.uk",The Way Way Back

The film is based around 14 year old Duncan (Liam James) who spends the summer at a beach house in Cape Cod with his Mother, Pam (Toni Collette) her boyfriend Trent (Steve Carell) and his daughter Steph (Zoe Levin). During his vacation Duncan get's a job working at a water park 'Water Wizz' and is befriended by the manager Owen(Sam Rockwell). This is not the first time we've seen Steve Carell play a less then pleasant character as he's well known for voicing Gru, the master mind villain of 'Despicable Me'. His portrayal of Trent is excellently performed, leaving us deeply disliking the character. Sam Rockwell gives us some great dialouge. He is both funny and very likable. Allison Janney plays Betty who is staying in the beach house next door. She brings a powerful presence and some great comedy. Ultimately 'The Way Way Back' is a coming of age story filled with comedy, some romance and even one quite powerful scene between Liam James and Steve Carell. A pleasant watch and worthy addition to the long list of summer hits.",The Way Way Back

148,DearIMDB,Painful Adolescence,9,5 January 2014,"An excellent film which for me had the same appeal as Stand By Me. The writing is thoughtful and poignant. From the outset I had a lot of sympathy for the adolescent boy, Duncan. He is awkward, out of his depth and miserable and hasn't yet found his place in the world, beautifully played by Liam James. His mother, the excellent Toni Collette had a vulnerability and desperation in her relationship with her new moody man (Steve Carrell), great to see him in a serious role playing a selfish and somewhat callous lover. The film reeled me in and I quickly warmed to it. There's something about holiday homes on the beach and summer heat that is very appealing. Anyway the boy looks for an escape from the group of boozy out of control adults and mum's boyfriend with whom he cannot connect, and finds it at a local water park and also a zany park attendant (Sam Rockwell) who has a detachment from authority that really appeals to Duncan. He also gets to know the girl living in the house next door (AnnaSophia Robb) who is as reluctant as he is to be there with her loud perpetually soused mother (Allison Janney) and little brother. The film is sad, sometimes tense but also funny and uplifting, it has it all. A really enjoyable movie with a great cast that I will watch again. The directors/writers, Nat Faxon and Jim Rash did a great job weaving an uplifting drama and both make notable cameo appearances. I saw Jim Rash recently in an episode of According to Jim in which he made an hilarious cameo appearance as a video store clerk. He brings the same dead pan humour to this. Anyway I loved the film and recommend it to anyone looking for a change from Rom Coms and SciFi beat em ups. You'll enjoy it.",The Way Way Back

They don't just stare down at the ground like a catatonic mental patient. My first hint that this was going to be a bad movie was when the unrealistically hot girl next door took a shining to the ""quiet new kid"". How cliché can you get? I was hoping it would get better from there. It didn't. The dialogue was scant and clumsily written. There were a lot of things going on beneath the surface that seemed thrown together hastily and were never explained. The character development was terrible and left me not caring about anyone.

It isn't awful, it isn't great. Why? Why do movies have to sprinkle lame songs around like so many mini-soundtracks to all of the stuff going on in the particular scene? Why did Toni Collette get such the short end of the stick on her part? (she essentially repeated her character from Little Miss Sunshine)...Why was Allison Janney's role so bizarrely written, so out of balance and front-loaded?....and as others indicated, the plot has more holes than Swiss cheese. This movie really doesn't have nearly enough feel-good parts to be called a feel-good movie - there are too many feels like crap moments that tilt the balance. The movie ending is more of relief, than joy...including relief that it is finally over.Clearly meant to be a general crowd-pleaser, I suppose it succeeds by not being particularly good anywhere, and at the same time, not awful enough to walk out on.

152,GenericBadGuy,A phenomenal directional debut from the Oscar winning writers of The Descendants,8,4 September 2013,"The Oscar train has started its engine, and it already has some impressive fuel. The Way Way Back contains some of the best acting and one of the best; if not the best screenplays I have seen all year. The Way Way Back is a masterpiece in every way.Despite the fact that I just said that the screenplay is possibly the best I have seen this year so far, the story is very basic. A shy teenage called Duncan has gone on holiday with his mum played by Toni Collette, her new boyfriend called Trent, who is played by Steve Carell, and also his daughter. They go to Trent's summer house up in New England where Duncan doesn't fit in so gets a job at the local water park run by a sarcastic 30 something man-child Owen played by Sam Rockwell, who gives quite possibly the performance of his career (then again, that's the case for many of the actors). Duncan then strikes up a friendship with Owen as well as his next door neighbours, a dipsomaniac played by Allison Janney, daughter played by AnnaSophia Robb. And from then on in the film plays out in an incredibly realistic manner and is possibly the most realistic film I have ever seen which is accompanied by a hilarious script. The relationships, if you can even call them that, are portrayed in a very realistic way as they don't escalate extremely quickly like they do in most films. The relationship between Duncan and Susanne (Robb) as until more or less the end of the film their relationship is entirely friendship and they only share one short kiss together and the relationship between Owen and one of his co-workers played by Maya Rudolph is equally realistic as you can see it develop throughout the film and all that Owen ever does is kiss her on the cheek or the forehead. I know I've said it before, but I'll say it again, it's the realism of these relationships that make them work.The Way Way Back is one of the best and most surprising films I have seen all year. Impeccably acted, wonderfully scripted, amazing characters and one of the best if not the best feel good films I have ever seen. If I had to sum up The Way Way Back in one word, I would say ,essential.",The Way Way Back

Wanted to smash him. Toni Collette, Amanda Peet and Allison Janney, three seriously talented women together, each with developed characters. And still no winking. Lucas the 14 year old was all of us when we felt different, lonely, hopeless and helpless. Every featured kid at Water Wizz was a person. Sam Rockwell seems to be ad-libbing but the script was so precise and perfect, I don't think so. He gets better and better.

154,movieguy592,Feel-Good Summer Film,8,14 August 2013,"Is this movie somewhat predictable? Yes. Then why does it work? Presentation.First let me say that there seems to be a growing trend when reviewing movies to make matter-of- fact statements that are in reality the user's opinion. I thought this doesn't have to be said, but just so everyone knows this review in entirely my opinion. If you agree - awesome. If you don't - great. The story follows the summer of Duncan who is unhappy about spending the summer with his mother Pam, her new boyfriend Trent and Trent's daughter Steph. As they arrive they are greeted by Betty, the pushy and nosy next door neighbor, and her middle child Susanna. Trent has some friends Kip and Joan that live near by, and seem to be the more wildly bunch. The movie does have some predictable set ups, and some run-of-the-mill gags. However it works because the performances are really good. Liam James as Duncan while bringing a bit to himself probably has the most difficult transition in terms of range. Rockwell definitely channels Bill Murray's Tripper from Meatballs. Janney is funny and does the hot mess Betty very well. Carrell while good as the jerk, he wasn't always believable - there seemed to be just something off about it - almost like he wanted to break into Michael from the Office and I think at times he might off (during the rainy day scene). Still a pretty solid performance. NOTE: The Trent Role Steve Carrell plays is not very comedic if at all, he's definitely more dramatic in this. So if you're hoping for laughs from his character - don't expect any. AnnaSophia Robb is definitely underrated as an actress and maybe if the Carrie Diaries continues past season two she'll get the recognition she deserves. She turned a really good performance in this film. Though it almost felt like she wasn't given enough to do. Likewise with Toni Collette, who actually scared me with ""the look"" - if you ever gotten one of those from your mother you know what I'm talking about. I felt the should have delved deeper into her a character - just a bit more.The water park scenes are fun, though you pretty much know what's going to happen, if not from it being done before then from the trailer*. But Rockwell, Rash, Faxon and Rudolph seem to make it work and make it entertaining. The Duncan/Susanna flirtiness I think works. It's not really a relationship, but a little more than friendship. She is curious about why he's so quiet and reserve and starts to see why and that they have more in common than maybe first realized. A lot of reviews I've heard that this would never happen in real life. I disagree - in fact I believe it's because of these types of movies that it seems to be happening even more. While now I'm not the same as Duncan, I was similar in that I wasn't very talkative around girls when I was 14-15, mainly because when I tried to speak I'd flub my words, etc. I was never as down as duncan, but I had girls like Susanna that were curious. Maybe they wouldn't have been as open about it as Susanna, but I've lived it so I can tell you it is definitely realistic. The movie is poignant, funny, and bittersweet. Though in tone it seems refreshing, and is a simplistic coming-of-age story that should leave you feeling good at the end of it. *The trailer shows practically a portion of every scene in the film. While not all of the trailer has sound, some might feel like it showed or spoiled the movie. Just a fyi and heads up.",The Way Way Back
155,djp2000,Don't miss this one,8,17 June 2013,"There are some movies which sound so simple that it's hard to convey to people just how good they are. The Way, Way Back is one of those movies. It's simply a coming-of-age story about a 14-year-old boy over the course of his summer break. There are no big action scenes or special effects here, just really good writing with actors who can bring such a realistic story to life.The movie begins with the boy, Duncan, riding in a car with his family to his mother's boyfriend's beach house. As the mother sleeps in the passenger seat, the boyfriend asks Duncan to rate himself on a scale of 1 to 10. After replying with a 6, the boyfriend insists that he's just a 3. What's surprising is that this seemingly heartless guy that the mother is dating is played by Steve Carell. Carell is known for playing lovable and funny characters. But he switches it up with this role. That scene sets the tone for how little Duncan is looking forward to this summer trip. And it doesn't help that his mother doesn't really set her boyfriend straight even when she is awake.To escape the annoyances at his new temporary home, Duncan takes a bike to ride around town with. When he finds a way into the local water park, he meets one of the middle-aged operators there named Owen. Duncan seems fascinated by Owen (played by Sam Rockwell) and how he uses humor in almost everything he says. It seems like he's never met anyone like him who's so worry-free and exudes such confidence all the time. (Sam Rockwell is perfect at playing this care-free kind of man-child.) Owen manages to get Duncan a job at the park where he tries to instill some of that same confidence in him as well. It becomes clear that as they bond with each other, Duncan wishes this would be the kind of guy his mother would date instead. The job at the water park also opens up a whole new fun side that this 14-year-old kid didn't even know he had in him.If not for the occasional Google or iPad reference, this movie could easily have taken place in the 1980's. The setting as well as the way people dress and talk to each other is right out of an 80's film - is it a coincidence that all of the music played in the movie is from that era? There's a very natural and wholesome vibe to it, especially in the water park scenes - nothing looks too modern or high-tech; it's just a place where people go to have an old-fashioned good time. While Steve Carell may be the most popular name on the poster, the movie has a great cast altogether. Toni Collette (The Sixth Sense, Little Miss Sunshine), in particular, does an amazing job as the mother torn between defending her son and trying to make things work with the arrogant boyfriend who doesn't always treat them right. But it's the scenes between Duncan and his new older friend Owen that are the heart of the movie. Sometimes it just takes the right person to bring out someone else's true colors and help them be comfortable in their own skin. And sometimes it takes the right movie to make you feel like a kid again. This one will have you yearning for the days when things were a little simpler.",The Way Way Back

Good Luck.Everyone did a great job and the movie was well directed, but I would like to take this chance to demand a movie where Sam Rockwell is on screen at least 95% of the time.Is that really so much to ask?He leaves you wanting more, which is the skill of a great actor or salesman or prostitute. TBH, I felt like this film really dragged in parts. Without spoiling it, Duncan, the main protagonist did an excellent job. The movie followed him, was centered around him and the problems and conflict of the story are no cause of his own, only falling on him.Such is the life for some kids in bad spots. My point is, in this movie when you don't really like the mother, the potential step father, the step sister, the neighbor--all the characters are playing in most respects negative roles to drive the plot, all of the burden falls on the protagonist, but, Duncan is a kid. He has no character to build on, which is the point. He is just a kid suffering a bad situation.If it was not for Sam Rockwell's role there would be no outlet in the movie, no levity. There would be no where for Duncan to turn to when things were bad.I can not stress how much Sam Rockwell's character and acting made this movie.

If you can't hook 38 minutes into a 96 minute film, you've got problems. The film also failed to generate nostalgia for the period it references. I was about that kid's age during this period in history, and yet I just didn't get that throwback retro feel. And I get that the dialogue was intentionally vapid because the characters are supposed to be vapid, but the film lacks the credible foil to make the vapidity amusing and meaningful.This film exposes the flaw in the Rotten Tomatoes tomato-meter.

Someone played a guitar and led singing, and I found that I could also play guitar and sing with others.The movie had me laughing out loud at the library showing, and I was delighted with the way this movie realistically told us about Duncan's summer of self-discovery! I look forward to the next movie these writers, producers and directors put together, I am sure they have more to tell us.",The Way Way Back

The characters were all completely cliché - not at all unique, interesting, funny, witty, deep, ANYTHING! What was with the mother in this movie? It's like she didn't even notice how unhappy her son was (or didn't care)...and Steve Carrel's character? Completely unlikable - how unusual for Steve Carrel who, although usually nerdy and clueless, is at least likable! The guy at the water park who befriends the young boy? Okay...weird.....the girlfriend? I don't even remember her, that's what a nothing impression she made on me.Where was the humor...the HUMANITY to this movie? I could make SIMS characters seem more full of life than these flat 2-dimensional characters! And what was with the pedophile pervert at the Water Wiz park, and why has NO ONE else mentioned this????? There is a young teenage girl wearing a way too small bikini standing in front of this ADULT man at the water park, and then, suddenly, as if we are following the gaze of this gross perv, the camera does a disturbingly SLOW climb up this young girl's (practically) naked body! (I know..I'm probably going to get young guys to watch the movie now because of what I'm saying,but I'm really addressing other adults and parents and yea, GIRLS out there in the world who don't agree with blatant objectification)! What kind of disgusting pervert even made this movie???? Anyway, so after THAT, I felt repulsed and turned the movie off.

Great casting, always love Steve carells acting, must have been easier with his girlfriend in this being called Pam. I thought he'd be the good guy, the rock. Who knew. But for me it was Sam Rockwell that stole the show.Sometimes a character pops up in a movie and makes all the difference, you wish that they didn't have to end with the movie, Owen was that character and Sam played it admirably and I bet many can relate to this movie, from different perspectives and that's what makes this a real heartwarming watch.",The Way Way Back

166,edroberts417,The Way Way Back,8,8 November 2013,"A shy, awkward teen thrown into a miserable situation with adults and peers ranging from emotionally abusive to uncaring finds acceptance and support from an unexpected and quirky source, and comes away with a new found social confidence and self-acceptance . Sound familiar? It should--it's only been done about a bazillion times. But it's not the story that counts. It's the way it's told that makes it or breaks it, and ""The Way Way Back"" tells it far better than most. Written and directed the team of Nat Faxon and Jim Rash, who together won a best screenplay Oscar for ""The Descendants,"" ""The Way Way Back"" is peopled with living characters, believably nuanced situations (with the exception of one somewhat awkward scene during a nighttime beach party) and smooth, seamless direction. Rest assured, we'll being seeing more of these two Relative newcomer Liam James plays Duncan, a shy and awkward teen dragged by his mother, her new boyfriend and his teenage daughter to one of those boringly generic east coast beach communities to spend what is supposed to be an idyllic summer. It doesn't work out that way for poor Duncan. His mopey sullenness smacks of passive aggression--he's the kind of kid you would rather not have around and is, naturally, shunned by the other teenage summer residents, who have apparently spent their summers together for years. The gown-ups, including his mother, don't like him much either. The mother (Toni Collette) shows some feigned concern for him when she is with him, but it's clear that she's just fine not having him around to dampen her thing with the new boyfriend and the ongoing partying that seems to be the main pastime of the neighborhood adults. The boyfriend, a self admiring prick named Trent (Steve Carell), seems to revel in his prickishness , getting a sadistic pleasure from berating and humiliating young Duncan--going so far as to tell him that as a person he rates a three out of ten. It's hard to tell if Carell could pull off a true dramatic role, but here he does show some versatility. He plays the prick just as well as he plays the dolt--and that's pretty damn good. Toni Collette, as Pam, Duncan's mother puts in a solid performance, as do the rest of the supporting cast. But the show belongs to Sam Rockwell.Ignored and with nothing to fill his days, Duncan commandeers an abandoned girl's bicycle he finds in the garage and cruises around town, eventually cruising into a local water park managed by a character named Owen, played to perfection by Rockwell. The Water Wizz Water Park is a place for locals (The rich summer folks have the beaches, so don't need a water park.), and Duncan, with his pale skin and bad haircut, goes relatively unnoticed and that is just fine with him--we get the sense that social interaction has never gone particularly well for him. He fits in here, if not perfectly, definitely better than he does with the tans and polo shirts of the beach crowd. Owen is a maturity challenged man who seems to have found contentment as the manager of a water park. His management style is laissez faire, to say the least, his employees are lackadaisical and the regular patrons are a pain, but the park seems to run well enough. Although an apparently constant frustration to his assistant manager (Maya Rudolph), the park employees seem to like him and work, well, as hard as they have to, which isn't muchEvery once in a while a movie is out and out stolen by an actor in a supporting role. Such is ""The Way Way Back."" This is Sam Rockwell's movie. The rest of it is well written, well acted and well directed, but Sam steals the show. Rockwell's Owen is cocky and has that sense of self assuredness that has more to do with not caring than it does with confidence but , as with all man-children, there is a pain and wistfulness, a sense of loss and defeat behind the sass and Rockwell plays it so subtly that it almost isn't there, which, ironically, makes it that much more affecting. Although the movies never drags, I found myself waiting for Rockwell's scenes. There is a tender quasi-love interest involving Duncan and one of the neighborhood girls which is also played on the downlow. Unlike so many teen-centric movies, ""The Way Way Back"" respects the intelligence of its audience and doesn't deliver its messages with all the subtlety of a hammer blow. Generally, The script avoids the stock angsty introspection and wisdom building of most coming of age movies, which is refreshing, and, unlike another amusement park coming of age movie which shall go unnamed, it doesn't have Kristen Stewart OR Jesse Eisenberg in it. Now THAT'S refreshing.",The Way Way Back

I was greatly touched by this tale of a sullen and lonely young boy who is ignored by his broken family, his mother's overbearing boyfriend and his daughter. A trip to the boyfriend's summer home find them among a group of often-drunken summer neighbors. The boy, Duncan, feels even more isolated until he meets water-park owner Owen. Owen gives Duncan a job and becomes his unexpected friend. I could really feel the boy's pain. This is the kind of story can be a little sad and a little funny, but heartfelt in the end.

I expected nothing out of this going in except a couple hours of my time. Instead, it just was a really fun ride. Everything worked, much like 'Groundhog Day"". The script, wonderful ensemble cast, fluid direction, spot on casting, made for just a fun couple of hours that I would recommend to anyone. There are so many ways this could have gone wrong, overly played. But it just worked and the direction kept everyone where they should be. Congratulations to the entire production team, and all I can say is that everyone should see this. Even if it's not a 10 in your book, you'll still love it.",The Way Way Back

The movie almost pulls it off, the too- sensible-for-his-age child, teaching people around him, and learning from an uber cool wash out; but almost. The movie is about the Kid and his emotionally vulnerable mother, and how as the male he seeks to protect her, clashing against the new male in her life. Of course, there's the cute neighbor he thinks of, and the awkward friends for the random comedy gags. Sam Rockwell, has played the character to perfection...but the character is so so exploited and abused, that you almost wish that he fails. As Owen, he plays the super cool has-been who now lives life on his terms, gets plenty of action, talks to strange kids, and interns young kids to become sensible adults. The actor is good, the character... the worst character though has to be Betty. I simply cannot understand why a talented actor like Allison Janney would try to pull this off: the typical over friendly neighborhood drunk, jokes about sensitive stuff, and is not a very good mother. Steve Carell is wasted, stuck in the background as he tries to make it work and more.Not a must watch, but a decent time killer.",The Way Way Back

And I think, so are at least half of American males.Watching Duncan, I saw myself; felt sad and happy, and remembered despondency, hopefulness and the magic of new-found confidence. Where many films that try this fall into a pit of saccharine schmaltz, this movie succeeds. The writing and acting worked: the characters are real. Assholes are not over the top assholes, friends are not superheros. It's like, life. The one exception are some plot contrivances near the end, but by that point you don't care because you care so much about the people.",The Way Way Back

It's a shame more people don't know about this one!,9,7 August 2013,"***There probably aren't any spoilers so don't worry just wanted to be safe and not get banned***What a breath of fresh air this movie was! I mean to have a summer filled with plot-less action cheap thrill movies or stupid trying-too-hard-to-be-funny comedies there is finally a silver lining- a movie that we can connect with in some way. That's exactly what the way way back brings to the table. So here's a breakdown of the key elements that made this movie great:Acting: the acting in this movie was very believable. Duncan's character especially with the way he slouched over and got all tongue tied like any awkward 14 year old would. But the most impressive performance was definitely Steve Carell. To go completely out of his comfort zone and play a douchebag for the first time ever - I didn't think he could pull it off, but he did in a BIG way. Writing/Directing: the script and dialogue in this movie were superb. Not too many cheap one-liners and everything just flowed. Faxon and Rash did a great job keeping it nice and simple. And finally the biggest element in my opinion: being able to relate. We've all been in a situation where it really sucked and we had to make the best of it somehow. And for me personally, I really saw a lot of my 14 year old self in Duncan. The awkwardness and shyness is all too familiar. All in all it was really a great summer movie for all audiences, highly recommend it!",The Way Way Back
175,sherilcox,Good News For Smart Film Fans,9,29 July 2013,"After waiting weeks and weeks for ""The Way Way Back"" I worried that the film might not be as worthwhile as I had been hoping. It finally opened here Friday and my anticipation was totally worth the wait.Directing team, Nat Faxon and Jim Rash, have plumbed all those dysfunctional adolescent pipes clogged with the debris of distracted parents, intimidating peers, and sympathetic strangers to deliver a charming coming-of-age story. Whether dealing with Alison Janney's boozy blue shadowed lush, Toni Collette's sad luminosity, or Steve Carell's contemptuous cad, Liam James offers a fourteen-year-old's awkward restlessness as he looks for a comfortable escape. He discovers one in an unlikely alliance with a charismatic Peter Pan played mischievously by Sam Rockwell. Other actors, including Faxon and Rash, add color and dimension to a film that also features a water park that is practically a character of its own.Clever camera work and lighting also establish and sustain the dopey perspective that enhance believable dialogue. Faxon and Rash's collaboration is neither contrived nor cliché, and I'm looking forward to sharing ""The Way Way Back"" with others when it becomes available on DVD and on demand. A bonus or two came in the form of memorable lines like ""See you next Tuesday,"" a new phrase that I'm proud to add to my personal lexicon.",The Way Way Back

I didn't finish it. I give it an honest try but dialogues were so unnatural (good actors become bad actors because of the script) and the film was so boring that I had to stop watching after the hour has passed. I hated all the characters (every one of them was dimensional caricature). I did't even like the boy. OK, he is troubled teenager, but he is so insecure that nothing interesting can happen to him. There is a line in one epic movie, ""never go full retard"". Same applies for the troubled teenagers. Never go all the way. Why do people like this film so much? Is it because it is indie? I saw a lot of indie films that received good reviews and were terrible.

180,eminent-archit,A Beautifully Made Movie!,8,22 October 2013,"Many movies are such that despite having the feel good factor right up there, fall prey to predictability. This is what directors Nat Faxon and Jim Rash avoid skillfully. The film takes the viewers in the direction of being predictable, but takes a U-Turn at the last moment. The film is about a timid 14 year old, Duncan, who is reluctant to spend his summer with his Mother's new boyfriend but he is forced to, at his mother's boyfriend's beach house. What starts off as a reluctant journey ends up to be a life changing experience for Duncan. Now, the plot of The Way Way Back is no extraordinary storyline yet it leaves an impression as deep as a Shawshank Redemption or an Inception would. The film benefits from the terrific performances pitched in by its three male leads. Liam James as Duncan delivers a restrained performance as the shy teenager. It is a refreshing change to watch Steve Carell play a character with negative shades with as much ease and finesse as he plays the comic roles. But the star of the movie is Sam Rockwell, as the carefree Water Park Manager, who brings life to the proceedings and makes you fall in love with his careless attitude.I am going with 4 out of 5 for THE WAY WAY BACK.

The Way Way Back turned out to be nothing more than a waste of time feel-good movie jam packed with so many clichés and caricatures that the movie became boring after twenty minutes. Twenty minutes in I knew exactly how the movie would end, nothing in this movie is subtle in the least and the film gives no reason for its existence. Don't waste your time on this way, way predictable snore. It's too bad to think that such a great cast was wasted. Despite the movie's complete lack of any sort of intrigue it is not without its few moments of charm such as a few comedic moments at the water park mostly due to the charismatic performance by Sam Rockwell as the goofy water park manager. Unfortunately as with every other character in the movie, Sam Rockwell plays a complete stereotype without any depth so the result is a movie that is perfectly digestible for a while but in the end is boring, not that funny, predictable, and a waste of time.",The Way Way Back

I won't give too much about the plot as I don't want to spoil. The performances were stunning. Sam Rockwell had to have watched meatballs to prepare for this smart-ass, funny role. Allison Janney plays the drunk neighbor who steals every scene. Steve Carrell plays the bad guy, and plays him so well. I would say one of his best performance. And Toni Collete as the mom gives a great ""sad"" role. I do not know how this movie was snubbed at the globes and Oscars. Rockwell and Janney should have been nominated.

There was nothing proprietary or especially original about the plot. It was just a very well acted, well written movie that I found easy to watch and enjoyable. It was an interesting break in character for Steve Carrell who usually plays a lovable nice guy. To see him in more of a ""bad guy"" role (if you could call it that in a family movie) was refreshing. Sam Rockwell was enjoyable as usual.

The actors do a terrific job all around--from the scene-stealing eyepatch kid to Allison Janey's lush to Steve Carrell's first role as a d-bag. Kudos to the kid playing Duncan and the guy playing his...boss? mentor? friend? saviour?--or all of the above. The scenery is lovely and convincingly real--no beach McMansions with $6,500 Wolf ranges. It shows what a real beach community looks like. The '70 Buick Estate Wagon is sublime and had me kvelling.But it's the story that really makes the viewer smile. Duncan is a lost, lonely, mess...14, stuck with his mom whom he loves (but doesn't really respect), her douchebag boyfriend, boyfriend's daughter, and not much else. He finds his way in a way that defines a coming-of-age story.

More than that, the movie was incredibly charming and made you wish for a happy ending. It even managed to squeeze in some good morals whilst maintaining its authenticity. In my most humble opinion, a must see.Duncan is a lonesome teenager whose life has been scarred by the divorce of his parents. Relectunt to go outside, he keeps to himself and broods over his mom's new boyfriend, Trent. He is dragged along to a summer cabin to spend his summer vacation with the new family, also including Trent's conceited daughter, Susanna.Almost by accident, Duncan makes an acquaintance with Owen, the fun-loving and outgoing manager of the Water Wizz Water Park. What ensues is Duncan gaining a new perspective on life.I do not think this movie lacks character development. Whilst I won't spoil who changes, there are definitely many who do.This drama/comedy is as poignant as its is funny. At times, it can make you ponder, and at others, it can make you unbelievably happy for its characters. The ending was most certainly realistic and left me pondering over the individual choices of the protagonists.",The Way Way Back

Even the supposed emotional climax of the film was laughably lame. To top things off, the main character was incredibly bland. By the end of the movie I still knew basically nothing about him.The only positive things about the film were a few of the performances.

The lead character doesn't just seem ""shy"", he seems down right autistic at times. There is zero emotional connection to any of the characters and many of the scenes are just not plausible. (the water park 'pop n' lock' dance scene being a good example). Hard to believe that the team who co-wrote ""the Descendants"" made this film.

It is about a marginalized kid who finds it difficult to fit into his family.The selection of Liam James as Duncan, the marginalized character, allows the viewer to have an instant understanding of what the movie is about because of his natural conservative appearance.The movie focuses on a child who finds it hard to fit into the society and unfolds the limitless abilities of them if given proper chance. It also takes the viewers through the experience of an American family who finds life difficult as they do not manage relationships properly and not properly respecting them. It shows how children get suffered because of their parents faults, how they get mistreated by their parents who doesn't have a settled relationship.""The Way Way Back"" has its moments of laughter but it cannot be classified as a comedy alone. It has a deeper meaning than most of the comedy movies seen these days.Overall, the movie is a little boring towards the middle part where it lacks punch and definitely cannot be classified as a ""Friday Night"". It can rather be classified as a movie the whole family can watch together and which guarantees to make the viewer rethink his/her perspectives about the society.",The Way Way Back
192,janmejay-vyas,The script's a winner here!,9,28 June 2013,"This is precisely the reason why we go to the movies. Every time the lights go off in the theaters, you witness a motion picture, to which you attach yourself for those two odd hours, you laugh with the characters, you cry, feel pain and you live in the movie. One experiences a plethora of emotions every time and that's the magic of movies for you, they have the power to transform you in their own little world. The Way, Way Back does just that, by bringing forth flesh and blood characters, people who may be your next door neighbors, someone in your family or someone you've seen at some point of time in your life. It's such a delight to witness a beautiful coming of age story,rooted with relatable characters and rock solid writing that it's hard not to fall in love with this little gem. The story revolves around Duncan (Liam James), a teenager low on confidence, self-esteem and fails to strike a conversation with people, a sort of an anti-social.The first scene, nicely establishes the uncomfortable relationship Duncan shares with his mother's boyfriend Trent (Steve Carell), when he asks him how he would rate himself on a scale of ten. Duncan, played superbly by Liam James, conveys a lot through his expressions and his presence. The scene where he accompanies his sister to the beach where she asks her to maintain a distance is a fantastic scene where you learn a lot about what's going on in Duncan's mind through his sitting posture, his style of walking and the way he fails to even maintain an eye contact while talking. It's such a finely written character with great attention given to the little nuances and finely played by Liam James that it's hard not to root for Duncan. He avoids being in the house most of the time and wanders around the new place on an old bicycle where her mom, his boyfriend and his step-sister along with him have come to spend the summers. He finds a friend in Owen (Sam Rockwell), who is a manager in a water park nearby, which becomes his hermit place for the summer. During that period of time, he gradually finds his voice and his inner self which help him gain confidence and self-esteem. The movie moves smoothly between its central theme as well as its subplots involving his family, and never once deviating. Even the supporting characters are so well etched out, such as Duncan's mother, who is well aware of the on goings but chooses to keep mum. Watch out for that powerful scene wherein Duncan's mother explains to him that at this stage of her life she needs someone to be with her, which pretty much explains her state of mind. Steve Carell is superb as Trent, who can't or doesn't care much about Duncan's state of mind and feelings. The Way, Way Back simply put, is simple storytelling at its best. It reminded me of a Hindi movie, Udaan, which draws parallels in one aspect i.e. a coming of age story of a young boy. Beautifully handled by director duo Nat Faxon and Jim Rash, The Way, Way Back is definitely a must watch, a movie that remains etched long after the lights come back on. Highly recommended!",The Way Way Back
193,ruby-wells764,A perfect summer teen hit!,9,17 January 2014,"This film lived up to all my (very high) expectations! Liam James did a great job of playing the awkwardly charming Duncan - I instantly fell in love with his character... I thought the rest of the cast was also fantastically chosen, especially the comedy genius of Sam Rockwell in the role of Owen. The script is brilliant - a perfect balance of rib-tickling comedy and tear-jerking drama will leave you feeling not only completely satisfied but warm and emotional. Nothing is overdone in this film - in fact, its subtlety is what makes it so endearing and memorable.I definitely recommend giving this film a try - I guarantee that you will find something in it that either makes you smile, touches your heart, or that you can totally relate to...",The Way Way Back
194,callumnorris,one of the best films of the year!!!!,7,4 September 2013,this is in my opinion one of the best films of the year it was amazing great acting great script and many hilarious moments.this contains spoilersthere were some scenes were the film made me very emotional like when his mum found out her boyfriend was cheating on her and he started to push him and then was annoyed at his mum for not doing anything so he ran away to the beach where he tried to kiss his girlfriend but she backed out then he apologised and ran away.i almost cried at the end when he had to leave and i have never had that with any other film. Now i am really hoping that they make a sequel where he returns to work at the water park and sees his girlfriend again.,The Way Way Back
195,sallyinco-828-922261,More reflective than funny but definitely worth a watch.,7,1 November 2013,"OK, to begin with I wouldn't really call this a comedy. I found that it was more of a sad story of a boy who was neglected emotionally and phycollogically. It made me really feel for the boy and empathise with him. It was done well but quite a few things were dumbed down for the audience, Steve Carell plays the controlling and altogether horrible character of the father figure brilliantly and almost all of the actors are great too. I was expecting a light comedy and I'm leaving it feeling reflective which is good; it's a great idea for a story. I'd probably recommend it for teenagers more so but it is definitely enjoyable, I'd almost want a sequel to find out what happens next.",The Way Way Back

The amount that I could relate to the lead character was uncanny.I think its safe to say that we've allll been there. I think most films that try to depict coming of age are way to obvious that it is an adult writing the script. But with this picture, this is as real as it gets. Funny, charming, and seriously entertaining, a must-see for families, and teens, or anyone wanting to go back for a wild ride into their youth. I even got a little teary-eyed during certain parts. The lead actor was great, Annasophia Robb was also very charming as well. You will regret missing this one. Sam Rockwell has a great/hilarious mentoring performance. I'd love to see more of all of the actors, because most of the them, except for Toni Collette and steve carrell, aren't seen much, or at least as much as they should be with their talent.",The Way Way Back
197,freebirdisgod,"An intelligent, inventive and heartwarming story of personal growth.",9,29 April 2014,"I did have high hopes for this movie after having seen the trailer, it seemed to categorically fit into place with movies like Juno, The perks of being a wallflower and many others. I was not mistaken it turned out to be a movie with a great deal of laughs, some moments where you can not believe people would ever be so cruel to a child and others where you see the main character grow.The main character starts out as a meek and shy young man, and through a series of events over a summer learns how to blossom and become someone that he never thought he could. The story has aspects of family considering this all takes place on a family vacation, but also has aspects of friendship and pretty much keeps the romance at a minimum thankfully as it would have taken away from the rest of the story.All in all this film was worth watching and not just once, if you are a fan of the dry comedy and movies which tell a story worth knowing you will love this movie! I know I did.",The Way Way Back

Both work extremely well in the audience connecting to all of these flawed characters. Having a movie set around a waterpark and during the summer allows audiences to connect on some sort of level. Great movie. I loved the whole cast. This movie was not clichéd when it could have been which allowed me to not get distracted in the movie like a clichéd action as seen in 20 other movies would have done. Pay attention to Nat Faxon and Jim Rash, who are so far 2 for 2 in making movies (The Descendants(writers)).Oscar: Sam Rockwell. Every line of dialogue was amazing.

This movie had the right soundtrack, the right plot, and the right actors. This movie really shows how good of an actor Steve is. It shows not only he can do funny movies, but a serious one as well. It is an awesome movie to see to cheer you up. Bring tissues though. This movie really brings you in to finding you're friends and having you're first crush. It really goes into depth with a shy 14 year old kid coming out of his awkward stage. I wouldn't recommend this movie for 10 year old's either. They might not pick up on, that the mom was cheated on and that Trent (Steve Carell) was cheating on the mom as well. But overall this movie is fantastic.",The Way Way Back
204,sunglide-7,Let me go Way Way Back and not buy the ticket to this film!,1,4 September 2013,"OK, I seem to be in a significant minority of people who did not like this film so I apologise for that, but I just did not enjoy it at all. Firstly, let me say that the acting was good though sadly the characters were not really given any depth. All credit to Steve Carell for not playing to type and being the funny guy in this but instead being the nasty, somewhat menacing boyfriend/would-be-stepfather. But as with all the characters in this film there just isn't any depth to them. Carell's character is unsympathetic.......and that's it. There is nothing to explain why he might be that way or enough interaction with the other characters to really get a feel for what is going through his head. I'm a big fan of Sam Rockwell ever since I saw him in Galaxy Quest and he does a good job but his character is just too clichéd and the writers are trying too hard to make him a quirky, fun guy.......and none of his lines are very original and therefore fail to be amusing. There were five of us in the cinema and at about the halfway mark two walked out. I assume the reason for this is because the story was incredibly boring and not funny at all! I went back to look at a description of the film after seeing it and was amazed it had been described as a comedy! If you want a comedy go to see We're The Millers! That really was funny and the audience had great fun. I cannot understand how this film has received such great reviews, honestly. It is as entertaining as watching dust settle.",The Way Way Back
205,nallukka-804-356972,charming light-hearted story with an ideal cast member for every part,7,9 January 2014,"Sweet little hundred minutes of light humor in a coming of age story. It's easy to empathize with Duncan but this doesn't have the agonizing pain and awkwardness of real life and most movies revolving around teens+tweens. Cute indie soundtrack rounds it out well. It's no Juno or Little Miss Sunshine in lasting power and rewatchability-I'll probably never have the urge to pop it in again-but it's perfect for a light couple of hours enjoying their sunny backdrop contrast with the gloomy unhappiness and seeing the predictable unusual places where happiness gets found.Summary: Yes, it is quite predictable. Yes, it is formulaic. Yes, despite those tired traits, it is worth seeing as they paired good writing with good actors for each part and great music and cinematography... There's one deleted scene called Do You Wanna Get Wizzed that I highly recommend watching. I wish it had been in the film!",The Way Way Back

208,zephanier,The predictability comforts you,9,15 December 2019,"It's rare to find a movie about an awkward teen and his transformation, in a realistic way. So rare that this movies doesn't exactly do that.But thats what makes it so great. Right off the bat you know the protagonist, Duncan and his ending. And you know why. But the unforeseen obstacles that are encountered make you understand why the 'cliche transformation' is going to take an hour. The predictability of the ending but the mystery of his obstacles leave you seeing problems in Duncans way but simultaneously as the viewer who knows what to do, you empathise but are also annoyed. Your become conflicted. And that's what's so great about the writing, it makes you think about life's problems from a completely new perspective.But what separates this movie from the ""TEN OUT OF TEN CLASSICS"" is that the film somehow uses unrealistic events, or some divine intervention to boost the plot along. Like two scenes that make you cringe for a brief moment.All in all the music in line with the script and again in line with the acting make the film enjoyable.",The Way Way Back

I usually love Steve Carel but in this movie I hated him... in a good way. Great cast, great performances, great story. the only thing I would have enjoyed done differently would be developing some of the side characters a bit more. Particularly Lewis, Jim Rash's character, i.e. the flipping DEAN *I just have so much love for this man* As I need to write at least 10 lines let me go in a bit more detail and praise this gem a little more. Great humor. Sam Rockwell keeps delivering line after line and his chemistry with Maya Rudolph is superb. I was also impressed by the star struck cast. I mean this movie is filled to the brim with brilliant actors. Lovely portrayal of the fears facing a single mother trying to find love again by Toni Collete. The compromises needed to be made, the mistakes that are sometimes unavoidable, the difficulty to balance your responsibility towards your child and your desire for love and fun. I could go on for hours but I don't want to spoil the journey this movie is bound to take you on. Enjoy.",The Way Way Back
211,dkenney_39,One of the Best Movies of the year,10,23 July 2013,"simply a great movie. lucky i looked at previews online for it because i never saw this advertised on TV at all. if you like teenage ""coming of age"" movies then you will like this. its similar to adventureland but the characters are actually more likable. the story basically follows a shy, teenage kid who is forced to spend the summer at his moms boyfriends beach house . as he began to open up, with the help of owen (sam rockwell) he went from having the worst to probably the best summer of his life. he meets sort of a love interest and friend in his neighbor at the beach house, which is filled with the awkwardness that you would expect from a kid like him. probably in my top 80 movies, see this movie. and its a movie you can actually watch with your family, a good fun and more wholesome movie that also highly enjoyable.",The Way Way Back
212,cj4567,A feel good summer movie,9,1 October 2013,"I went into this movie with medium level expectations, not being a huge fan of Steve Carrell lowered these expectations; however I left a very happy viewer. The Way Way Back is feel good comedy about a teenage boy Duncan (Liam James) and his trip of self discovery during a summer vacation with his mother Pam, her boyfriend Trent (Carrell) and his daughter to Trent's beach house. This movie is very easy to identify with for a wide variety of people, be it a mother, a child or a stepfather, hence why I think I enjoyed it so much. In this movie Carrell steps away from his usual funny self and plays a character who quite frankly is a bit of a douche. On the other hand it can be said that Steve got the mean boyfriend down to a tee and this was a refreshing difference to his usual roles.As shown in the trailer the movie begins with Trent posing the question to young Duncan how he would rate himself out of 10. The moment Trent announces his opinion that Duncan is a mere 3 you are immediately thrown emotions and start to care for this Duncan character, (character connection I'm told is vital in a movie and these guys have done it right). Within the first 10 minutes or so you are able to identify the first predictable event in the movie in the form of teen Susanna (Anna-Sophia Robb) the neighbours daughter, I will let you figure out what was so predictable! As the movie progresses young Duncan finds a water park owned by Owen (Sam Rockwell), it is here that Duncans self discovery really begins as does a lot of the comedy. In way Owen acts as big brother to Duncan and brings him out of his shell inevitably to prove Trent wrong about that number 3 (predicatble moment number 2). This new Duncan definitely proves Trent wrong and helps discover an underlying issue in his mother's relationship with Trent as well as his own relationship with her. It hence can be said that this movie isn't just about that mean boyfriend our Mothers have had but about that moment when a Mother realises they were wrong.Despite the predictable outcomes I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and would definitely recommend it. However I hear you ask if it was so good why not give it the full 10 stars? Well even though the ending was nice and warm I felt I was left waiting for more and was left sitting there wanting a certain reunion which when the screen went to black I knew wasn't happening. This movie is full of moments that will make you laugh and some that will make you sad but overall you will definitely leave with a smile on your face and a warm feeling inside.",The Way Way Back

This would have happened if I was Duncan"" Because it's making was that realistic.I am a fan of Sam Rockwell but after this I have become more.

Rest of the cast did pretty good also.This film personally gave me the feels.",The Way Way Back
214,olivierthery,Brilliant for its lack of depth.,2,18 January 2014,"I will make this brief: Characters are one dimensional; no nuances at all. Dialogs lack spontaneity to the point of sounding unnatural. Acting is rather poor and seems forced, with the exception of Toni Colette. The usually excellent Sam Rockwell is trying his best and failing, but he can't entirely be blamed here as a good actor can rarely save a terrible script. Even Anna Sophia Robb, who was so endearing and vibrant in some of her previous roles, doesn't seem to be comfortable reciting a script that, I feel , she does not believe in herself. The stereotypes abound and it seems the script was calibrated to include certain 'ingredients' that the average superficial viewer might want. Skip this one. In my opinion, some commercials have more depth than this movie.",The Way Way Back

Plus I just had my wisdom teeth out and needed something to do.I made it up to the ridiculously cheesy breakdance scene before turning it off.Besides the flat, two dimensional acting, boring storyline and cliche'd characters, I could just not understand why a grown man (Owen) would so actively pursue the friendship of a socially awkward adolescent (Duncan).Additionally, I found Owen to be quite annoying in both his demeanour and dialogue, Steve Carrell as the stubborn step dad was nothing short of laughable, and Toni Collette's character was just an apathetic bystander in a mundane and predictable plot.It will be a while before I invest my time in other movie I think.

219,alteredstu,A lot of potential but too many flaws,5,28 August 2019,"This could have been great. I'm a sucker for a good coming of age film so I was looking forward to this. There are some interesting performances and character relationships, but overall there are just too many frustrating flaws.The 14 year old boy Duncan was really overplayed. I get that he's quiet and awkward, but he was just too sullen to be believable. He comes across as autistic, which I don't think is the intention.The plot is mundane and predictable. I am pretty sure that almost anyone could tell what was going to happen in the film. The kid learns to come out of his shell. The mother learns that she deserves better than her jerk boyfriend. Mother and son grow closer. The end. Nothing original or new.There are elements to the plot that are completely unrealistic. The mother doesn't care that her son disappears all day every day while on vacation? She doesn't bother to find out where he's going? It doesn't raise an eyebrow when an older man drives him home with no explanation? Duncan has social anxiety and is extremely introverted, yet in one scene he lies on the roof of the car, outside, with his eyes closed and sings along loudly to the music in his headphones? This is lazy writing. The writers wanted something embarrassing to happen to Duncan in front of the cute girl, so they go with this, even though it is completely out of character. What else... Oh yes, the plot calls for Owen the waterpark owner to do something irresponsible. So three kids get stuck in the waterslide and he sends the biggest kid he can find to blast them out. Never mind that it is physically impossible to get stuck in a waterslide, and it is entirely clear that the three kids are not stuck, just acting badly. Lazy writing again. Duncan acts ridiculously out of character at another point where he suddenly has the confident to break dance in front of a crowd. Yeah right. And why does the cute girl next door want to hang out with Duncan when he is such a loser and won't even talk with her? I get that it's an important plot point but it's poorly written.The biggest positive is Sam Rockwell's performance. He steals every scene he is in. I think I'd prefer to watch a film just about his character.Overall, this movie is watchable but forgettable.",The Way Way Back

It's a shame that this didn't get won or even get nominated for an Oscar, definitely an underrated film.Despite adding a small but cute romance story in (like most teenage movies), the balance between all the genres is perfect. It's one of those coming of age movies that gets the awkward teenager thing right. People always said how Sam's performance blew this out of the water, but in my opinion so did Liam and Steve's!

That time when you were staying in a new place on vacation and the tether binding you to your parents up to that point was finally extended allowing you to roam and meet new people on your own? Well this is the first time I have found a film that effectively encapsulates that feeling. I suppose Dirty Dancing came close but used it for social commentary, and maybe Meatballs and Adventureland to a lesser extent.Sam Rockwell comes out of nowhere with a performance I didn't even realize he was capable of, portraying the coolest dude on film since ""The Dude"" Lobowski. A beach bum slacker type who skates through life on his loquaciousness and good humor that everyone would want to have as a friend. He uses those gifts to teach important life lessons to the kids that come to his water park and this film is centered around one such miserable kid caught in an awkward stage of adolescence dealing with extensive problems at home.Spot-on performances abound by greats such as Toni Collette who delivers her complex role flawlessly. Steve Carell has taken a huge step towards diversifying his career with this role as he is one mean egotistical son of a beech, sorta what I would imagine Pacino's character from Glengarry Glen Ross being with his family on vacation after ripping people off every day in his work life. Liam James is the awkward adolescent the film is centered around and AnnaSophia Robb is his innocent romantic interest who is cute as a button. There are just too many many more great supporting characters here to mention them all without making this commentary seem like a list but everyone is extraordinary.The film has the same writers (Nat Faxon and Jim Rash) of the phenomenal film The Descendants(2011) who have gone on to write AND direct this film and their attention to detail that realistically portrays life is quite evident.

I get that many people will try to understand how he is feeling and blablabla, but those attitudes toward his family is just plain unacceptable, and the worst part is that he gets to kiss the most beautiful girl on the block.

Just wanted to say that I usually like these kinds of movies, and I'm not too critical by nature. I tend to find the good in most movies and focus on that rather than the bad. And i thought this would at least be pretty good. So me saying this was just a big bore through and through might tell you something. Its decent at best but has barley any character let alone character development to get involved in or care about. Which is what I expected there to be. And I can't say there are any fun elements to save it, frankly I'm not sure why Comedy are among the genres for it . So while 5/10 for me isn't the grade of a terrible movie , but more like a why even waste your time kind of rating. So you might want to skip this one unless it's your favorite ""genre/theme"" by far and you very easily get involved in characters even if they give you just some crumbs to work with.Oh and yeah, the acting was fine.

Excellent performances by the entire ensemble, and the young actor's performance that plays Duncan, unbelievably authentic.

It's about the awkwardness and embarrassment of adolescence and finding friendship.Sam Rockwell is hilarious in this and the young actor was really, really good too. It was also great to see Steve Carrell play against type. I hated him in this movie so he did a great job.Go see this movie please! You will laugh and you may cry.

229,zacklakes,The Whole Movie is in the Trailer,6,14 February 2014,"***There are only spoilers that took place in the trailer, and in no way did I try to summarize the movie.***I became excited for this film after viewing the movie's trailer. I'm usually never bored enough to go around watching trailers for upcoming movies, but The Way Way Back trailer made me feel very fortunate for my boredom. It really hit a soft spot in my heart that I had never remembered a trailer ever doing before. When the boy is pouring his heart out to Sam Rockwell about how his pseudo step-dad, Steve Carell, called him a 3 out of 10 it nearly brought a tear to my eye. Thankfully, I was socially brainwashed by my father to never cry, so I dodged a bullet there. Anyway, The Way Way Back had about the most emotional trailer I can ever remember seeing. So when I went to experience the actual feature film I set my empathy levels to high and prepared my self for an emotional roller coaster such as the trailer had advertised. I watched the entire movie and was disappointed to find that it didn't really add anything to the limited enjoyment the trailer gave me. If we added it up I think it'd be fair to say the movie only gave me a solid 4 minutes of good sentimental moments. The trailer gave me 2 and a half. The other 99 minutes of the movie just didn't seem to add to any weight or development to the story of the young boy. The scene where the boy is venting his soul to Sam Rockwell that had resonated with me so much in the trailer happened towards the end of the movie, and it turned out to be the best moment by far. However, aside from the beginning scene when Steve Carell actually calls the boy a 3, there was nothing poignant between these scenes that escalated or added depth to that situation. Steve was at worst a mild annoyance to the boy only a couple times after saying that to him. It almost came completely out of nowhere when the boy did finally bring it up to Sam Rockwell. I'm not saying the film didn't try at all to add to the drama of their relationship, but I am saying it didn't do anything that really worked well. On top of this, there were a lot of pointless subplots introduced that didn't have a lot to do with the overall focus, and there were a lot of characters that were set up to seem important that didn't end up doing anything. The movie wasn't completely bad. It did keep my attention throughout, and it had an okay heart; I just think it could have been a lot better with more focus on relevance. There were a lot more minor details that I liked, as well as a some details with which I had issues. I just wanted to put up a short review to say that if you've seen the trailer, I don't think it is necessarily worth it to watch the full length film.",The Way Way Back

This movie did not let me down. The cast was wonderful, and the movie possessed a light hearted feeling of summer. I have never been a big Steve Carrel fan but he pulled off the jerk role well and was a nice compliment to Toni Colette who was forgettable but acceptable. The real stars here though were the odd ball supporting roles. Allison Janney was hilarious as the crazy neighbor and her son in the movie was equally funny. I was also pleasantly surprised by the young actors in the film who all handled their roles very well. This film is funny and quirky while still showing the hardships of adolescence and of life. It examines relationships in a beautiful way and reminds us f the simple importance of human relationships and just how difficult they can be to maintain. Overall I thoroughly enjoyed it, and think it is definitely worth going to see.",The Way Way Back
231,tom-1104,Way Way Back is a good place to visit,7,26 July 2013,"""The Way Way Back"" is a place I am used to, so this movie was an easy choice. It's a coming-of-age movie written and directed by the team of Nat Faxon and Jim Rash. These boys won a screen writing Oscar for ""The Descendants,"" which they penned with Alexander Payne (Sideways). It follows that they would make this their directorial debut, as they are oddballs and that's what this movie is about.Duncan (Liam James from 2012) has to go with his mom Pam (Toni Collette from Little Miss Sunshine) to her boyfriend's beach house for the summer. It's supposed to be a time for Duncan and Trent (Steve Carell from Seeking a Friend for the End of the World) to bond since Duncan hates him. Many movies veer off into cliché-ville about here, but this movie, like Duncan, chooses it's own path.Trent has a daughter of his own, who is a hot and popular teenager and also wants nothing to do with Duncan. There is a bunch of great talent in this movie that fill out a nice ensemble. I have to mention Trent's neighbor Betty (Allison Janney from Juno), who is a beautiful mess and the poster child for bad cleavage. Her darling teenage daughter, Susanna (Anna Sophia Robb from Soul Surfer), is also hot and popular, but appreciates that Duncan is different.Although I like Duncan, and I agree with him that Trent is a jerk, Trent is right when he tells him in the opening scene that Duncan is a 3 on a scale of 1 to 10. The truth is, most 14-year-old boys are a 3. I know this, because I was a 1.85. No confidence, no charisma and no game. Add to that divorced parents, and Duncan's life really does suck. Fortunately he gets away from those crazies and meets some new crazies in the form of Owen and Caitlin (Sam Rockwell from Moon and Maya Rudolph from Bridesmaids). Duncan eventually sees that everybody struggles with relationships. People are not perfect and are seldom a perfect match. Though, when a game of Candyland turns into a blood sport that might be a clue you are not with the right person.I enjoyed this movie. I knew it was a trip to the beach and a coming-of-age movie, but the oddball filmmakers made sure it did not suck and was not something I have seen a hundred times. People in their forties come of age in this movie too, and you get to see Duncan do something in a water slide that is legendary. For that I give this movie 4 stars out of 5, and I consider it a family movie standout. I don't know why it's PG-13 unless it was the bad cleavage. So, if you were once a 3 or less, like me, see this movie. You will come out feeling like a 7.",The Way Way Back
232,e-christman,"Film Review: The Way, Way Back (2013) Comedy, Drama",7,4 December 2013,"The Way, Way Back is a funny, lighthearted, and moving coming of age story set in the present day about a 14-year-old named Duncan (Liam James) and his summer vacation in Massachusetts with his mother, Pam (Toni Collette), her domineering boyfriend, Trent (Steve Carell), and his attitude prone daughter, Steph (Zoe Levin). Having a hard time fitting in, the introverted Duncan finds an unexpected friend in gregarious Owen (Sam Rockwell), the irresponsible manager of Water Wizz, a local water park. Here, Duncan is given a part time job and is taken under the playful, sardonic wing of Owen, who acts as more of a Father figure to Duncan than his mom's boyfriend, Trent. Not surprisingly, Duncan loves the park, and the other misfit employees that have grown up around the park's shabby precincts. They are the surrogate family Duncan has been looking for, and he races off to join them every day of the summer without his actual family really noticing. With some new found confidence, Duncan is able to slowly open up and finally find his place in the word. He is able to rally the courage to stand up for himself and his meek mother, have a semi—comfortable relationship with his ""girl next door"" neighbor (Anna Sophia Robb), and even learns to dance and be ""cool"" all during a summer he will never forget.Though seldom laugh-out-loud funny, The Way, Way Back is the kind of movie that puts a smile on your face and keeps it there. It's warm and charming, with sincerity and affection. It's a modest story about growing up with the not-so-perfect families that fate often hands you, but within this, the movie is compelling and features a handful of winning performances from the cast.The writers (Nat Faxon and Jim Rash), who also co-directed and have small roles in the film, take a fairly straightforward story of growing up with divorce and make it feel fresh and real. This authenticity gives the movie its witty, relatable edge. These writers are experts in recognizing mood and in their directorial debut, used lightening (among editing and other things) to prevent the film from spiraling into an after-school special. The writers do a phenomenal job exploring human interaction and gender relations in a film that could easily be overlooked.The Way, Way Back is a quality movie that will touch a chord in anyone who once felt marooned in a world that didn't seem to care. I highly recommend it to any potential viewers.",The Way Way Back
233,ehitsamill,Fun Comedy That Leaves A Bit To Be Desired.,6,3 November 2013,"Warning: KIND of spoilers in this review. I don't diverge any major happenings. But i do slightly brush about some of the conflicts the characters have and what i saw right/wrong with them.It took me a few days after watching ""The way way back"" for me to decide if i had liked the movie or not. I still am not sure exactly how i feel about it. To put what i feel about it in a nutshell i would have to say that it was a fun and sometimes funny movie that i will probably forget i had ever seen.The acting surely was not amiss as Liam James did a pretty good job portraying the awkward teenage boy that has become a pretty popular character type in light hearted drama comedies over the last few years and the supporting staff (most notably Steve Carell, Sam Rockwell, and Jim Rash) were brilliant in the small doses we get to see them. Which brings me to my next small gripe. This movie has a lot of great side characters with their own side plots, so much so that we never really get to see any of them enough to make us really care about what is going on with any of them. This is, in my opinion, this movies biggest flaw.Am i reading too much into this movie? After all it seems like it is set up for just a ""light hearted fun watch with just enough conflict to carry a story"". Well, maybe. In fact, I'll be the first to admit, that is EXACTLY what this movie is. No more, no less. Its pretty vanilla.Now, i would feel remiss if i didn't point out how much i enjoyed seeing Steve Carrel play a character that i have never seen him play. I have a soft spot for the guy and think he has been hit or miss in the last few movies he has been in. He will always suffer from being type-casted in my head because of how much i loved him in ""the office"" (it doesn't help that his girlfriend's name is ""Pam"" in this movie). If the subplot of him and Duncan's troubles were explored more i think this movie could have really turned into something special.I would also like to point at that Sam Rockwell was pretty great in this movie also. His character, the sort of ""mentor that plays by his own rules"" got the most laughs out of me and the scenes with him and Liam James are definitely the movies brightest moments. I would say the subplot of him befriending Duncan could probably be considered the main plot of the movie (i guess?) and still, yet again i would like to say that if this plot line was explored a little more i think the movie could have been something special.The ending is nothing spectacular if not anti-climatic. And if the movie doesn't apologize for being a ""feel good comedy"" through the length of it, i kind of would have liked to see a ""feel good comedy"" ending to go along with it.I would say it is worth a watch if you just want a pretty good comedy with a great cast. But ""The way way back"" might leave you feeling a little hungry after you get done watching its anti climatic ending. I would say its a tad above average. 6/10 if there ever was one.",The Way Way Back
234,mfontaine2,Film Review: The Way Way Back,9,20 November 2013,"""The Way Way Back"" is quirky coming of age comedy that speak to the inner-outcast in us all. The film focuses on the extremely awkward and strangely enigmatic 14-year old Duncan (Liam James), who is caught right in the middle of a messy divorce, and is being forced to spend the summer with his mother, her new 'jerkish' boyfriend, Trent (Steve Carell) and her boyfriend's (older )teenage daughter. The movie takes place at Trent's beach house, where Duncan struggles to find enjoyment in anything, as he's forced to play a role in his mother's newfound relationship. Duncan, soon becomes fed up staying at the beach house, and ends up sneaking out for a bike ride, where he discovers the water Water Wiz water park. Here Duncan is befriended by the water park manager Owen (played by Sam Rockwell), who takes him under his wing, representing the father figure that Duncan so badly wanted in his life. Throughout the movie, Owen along with the rest of the Water Wiz staff, and his beach house neighbor, all encourage Duncan to take chances, have fun, and enjoy his summer. Duncan ultimately gets a job working at the park, and bit-by-bit Duncan begins to come out of his shell and finally starts enjoying his summer. The movie culminates with a touching ending that highlights the significance of family, friendship and most of all enjoying life. The film is really brought together by the brilliant acting performances all-around. James gives an awesome performance embodying an awkward teen that most viewers can relate to in one way or another, not to mention the supporting roles of Duncan's mother, Pam (played by Toni Colette), her boyfriend Trent, and Owen (Sam Rockwell) which emphasize the roles that adults play in a teen's life. Throughout the movie the viewer witnesses the effects of each adult's relationship with Duncan, which emphasizes the main theme of the movie- overcoming the obsession with how others see you. The indie-style of this movie gives this film an additional 'charm' factor that sets this apart from other coming of age films. Unlike films such as 'the The breakfast Breakfast club' Club' or 'Ferris Bueller's day Day off'- which focuses on charismatic characters who are portrayed by (at the time) very well-known actors,-'the The way Way Way Back' focuses on the socially awkward Duncan, played by the relatively -unknown Liam James. By casting an unfamiliar actor to play an over-exaggeratedly socially awkward teen, the viewer is able to reflect on this character as someone they may see in themselves, giving this film a sort of mass-appeal and realism that is unparalleled in other films of this genre. This movie has the uncanny ability to take a rather serious storyline of a young teen's struggle to find happiness in the midst of a messy divorce, and turn it into a touching story that will make you laugh the whole way through. I recommend to any viewer who enjoys a film that will make you laugh, but not at the expense of any significance. This film is truly great in the sense that it will not only entertain, but will also open the door for a little self-reflection as the viewer connects with their 'inner-Duncan'.",The Way Way Back

237,voiceactivatedboy,My Review with *Spoilers*,8,25 January 2013,"*Spoilers* *Spoilers* I just watched this film last night at Sundance, and it's great! Hopefully it doesn't take too long for the film to be distributed, as I read that the film was purchased by Fox Searchlight for nearly 10 million. It reminded me a lot of ""Adventureland"" in its tone and feel, but it's a little more family-friendly, and it definitely is a PG-13 movie for those that were wondering.The film focuses on Liam James character Duncan, a quiet, anti-social teen dealing with the recent divorce of his parents. His father has since relocated to San Diego with a younger girlfriend, and despite his desire to stay with his father for the summer, he ends up having to go with his mom and her boyfriend to spend the summer at her boyfriend's beach house. You come to understand that Duncan's mom Pam (Toni Collette) is aware of her boyfriend Trent's (Steve Carrell) wandering eye, but she is enamored by his charm, and maybe more so by the need for companionship and security. Duncan makes no effort to hide his disdain for Trent, who belittles his social skills, and later in the film goes so far as to tell him he is unwanted by his own father. Trent chastises Duncan about building mutual respect and trust, and yet he is banging his best friend's wife Joan (Amanda Peet),a fellow summer home yuppie. You later find out through dialog between Joan and Trent, that their little trysts seem to be a regular summer tradition.Duncan is looking for any way out of the situation, or at least how he can spend as much time as possible away from Trent, Trent's own teenage daughter, and their friends. He sparks up a nice friendship with Susanna (AnnaSophia Robb), a teenage girl mature beyond her years, who has grown tired of Trent's daughter and the other arrogant, shallow teenagers she is forced to hang out with at the beach all summer. She gets Duncan to open up to her a little bit, and acts as a channel of relief for Duncan away from the people he despises.The real magic within the film is the relationship between Duncan and Owen (Sam Rockwell),a middle-aged operator of a water park within the resort town, who also comes from a troubled past and a strained relationship with his own father. Owen uses his humor and confidence to try and instill the same in Duncan, and provides Duncan with not just a summer job to get him away from the beach house, but also an environment where he can learn to be outgoing and build a number of friendships. Owen knows that Duncan has trouble at home, but is careful not to pry too much, until he can see that Duncan really needs someone he can open up to. The three quirky water park employees aside from Owen that the movie focuses on are played by Maya Rudolph, Nat Faxon, and Jim Rash.I knew it was a drama with some comedic elements, but the interesting thing about this film, is that you would assume some of the funnier moments would come from the likes of Steve Carrell and Maya Rudolph. They, however, bring more of the dramatic elements to the film, with Steve Carrell playing the dirt bag boyfriend of Toni Collette, and Maya Rudolph (Caitlyn) a water park employee who is facing a mid-life crisis of sorts. She had planned on working at the water park for one summer, but is now in her fourth year there, and is starting to second guess herself and the time she has invested in the park.Caitlyn is continually frustrated by the park manager's lackadaisical attitude and laid-back nature, but like many of the longtime employees there, she is continually drawn back by the prevalent family culture and the friendships she has formed while working at the park. The water park operator is played with charm, wit, and panache by Sam Rockwell, who has long been one of my favorite actors, and provides many of the funny and heart-wrenching moments of the film.Most of the other big laughs come from Betty (Allison Janney), who is the slightly eccentric and sexually-repressed neighbor of Steve Carrell's character. She has a socially deprived son with a lazy eye named Peter (River Alexander), and the relationship between Betty and Peter provide some of the lighter moments in the film. There are also a couple of great moments when Duncan takes Peter to the water park to meet his co-workers, and helps Peter gain some new found confidence of his own.I'll leave the ending out of my review, but I think you will find it heartfelt and satisfying to say the least. This film is highly recommended.",The Way Way Back
238,maryjoygilbert,"Way way better than the ""typical"" coming of age film",10,17 November 2015,"On a scale of 1 to 10 what do you think you are? How would you rate yourself? Well, if you are 14 year-old Duncan (Liam James) you may think of yourself as a 6 out of 10. What if you, a teenage boy, were told by an adult that you are actually a 3 out of 10? This interaction between teenage Duncan and his mother's boyfriend Trent (Steve Carell) is the scene that opens The Way Way Back. This glimpse into the life of Duncan, his internal conflicts and demons, draws the audience in immediately. From the first scene, the audience is emotionally tuned into the boy's struggle. The Way Way Back may be labeled as a typical coming of age tale, but it is the execution of the story that sets the film above the rest. Some films sound so simple that it is hard to communicate how good they actually are. The Way Way Back follows Duncan, a 14 year-old shy, slightly introverted teen, over the course of his summer vacation. He is forced to spend his summer in his mother's boyfriend's vacation home in Massachusetts. Duncan resents his mother Pam's (Toni Collette) overbearing boyfriend Trent and is horrified at the prospect of spending an entire summer with him. After arriving at the beach house, Duncan meets Trent's boozy neighbor Betty (Allison Janney) and her two kids: possible love interest Susanna (AnnaSophia Robb) and lazy-eyed Peter (River Alexander). After being forced to interact with all the dysfunctional ""spring breaking"" adults, Duncan looks for an escape. He finds an old bike and explores the beach community. Duncan stumbles upon Water Wizz, a water park, where he meets manager Owen (Sam Rockwell). Owen takes Duncan under his wing and throughout the course of the film, Duncan begins to break out of his shell. Owen gives Duncan the confidence boost he has so desperately needed. Duncan even uses this newfound confidence to stand up to his mother and Trent in a very beautiful, emotional, and heartbreaking scene. The Way Way Back overcomes the typical ""coming of age"" formula with the help of some spectacular performances. Each of the characters is flawed, yet real and relatable, and are brought to life by wonderful actors. Special mention needs to be given to Sam Rockwell whose charm and wit provides so many of the funny, as well as the heart- wrenching moments in this film. Steve Carell definitely plays an off-type role, as he is neither the main star nor the comic relief. Liam James brings the character of Duncan to light in a brilliant and vividly emotional way: allowing the audience to empathize with his struggles and experience his pain. The Way Way Back is the directorial debut for screen writing duo, Nat Faxon and Jim Rash. Faxon and Rash previously won an Academy Award for best adapted screenplay for The Descendants. Faxon and Rash's portrayal of Duncan's story is sincere and powerful. The idea for this film stemmed from the real life experiences of a young Jim Rash and his complicated relationship with his stepfather. In their directorial debut, Faxon and Rash demonstrated their eye for beauty— both conventional and unconventional. Beauty can be found in nearly every frame of The Way Way Back. The vibrant colors and beautiful lighting of the outside world, contrast perfectly to Duncan's darker and harsher lighting. With this harsher lighting, Faxon and Rash are able to capture Duncan's dejected loneliness without words. There is even beauty in the run-down, early 2000s, feel of the Water Wizz water park. The water park has a cleansing, almost baptismal effect on Duncan's emotional transformation—changing him from a miserable soul to a confident human being.The Way Way Back proves that sometimes all a person needs is a little encouragement and kindness in order to gain confidence, ultimately helping them become comfortable in their own skin. This film made me laugh hysterically and cry uncontrollably. The winner of the Newport Beach Film Festival's Audience Award for Feature Film, and the nominee for several Critic's Choice Movie Awards, The Way Way Back is a film surely not to be missed.",The Way Way Back

251,e-murtha,A movie that will make you remember summer,9,24 June 2013,"What is it about scenes of beach towns in upstate NY or New England that cause Canadians (like myself) to drool and fantasize about the idyllic all-American lifestyle? (It's true, it happens and if a Canadian doesn't admit to it, they're lying.)The Way Way Back is a movie staring Steve Carell, Sam Rockwell, Amanda Peet, Toni Collette, Maya Rudolph and Anna Sophia Rob (Bridge to Terabethia, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory). Really, the movie is anything but an idyllic picture of American childhood, but writer/director duo Jim Rash and Nat Faxon manage capture that quintessential appeal of the American dream; when you find your own way, everything will work out in the end.From the road trip to the sea in the 1980's station wagon, to the slamming screen door of the clapboard beach house, the espadrilles, the cut off shorts and the July 4th Celebration, it's a movie about summer, family and the universal anguish that stems from an adolescent life lesson we probably all remember; you don't have to conquer the world alone.Duncan, 14, played by Liam James (2012, Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem) struggles to come to terms with his mother's (Collette) new relationship with Trent (Carell) while a guest at Trent's family beach house in upstate NY. In an unanticipated role from Carell, who plays an asshole of a father figure, we can remember what it's like to live in a teenage world where you're always wrong, misunderstood, and can never shout loudly enough to be heard over the hypocrisy of your parents.The family cottage itself (appropriately dubbed ""The Riptide"") is rustic, nostalgic and transparent; everyone's business is everyone's business along this strip of the ocean front. In fact, it's as if the characters buy into the community aspect of sharing dirty laundry while living in a beach town during the summer - which is probably part of the movie's magic given that you're able to fall in love with the concept of a dysfunctional family. In this movie, the dysfunctional family becomes something you want to be a part of so that you can take part in the neighborhood clam bake.James' role as Duncan is so convincing that memories both awkward and lonely of your own teenage years will begin to bubble up from the areas of your subconscious you thought you had erased when you left high school behind.Just when you can't take another minute of the ugly-step father injustice, Duncan meets Owen (Sam Rockwell) the 30-something lovable big-brother type who has been the manager of Water Whiz water park since (probably) the early 1990's. The water park is dilapidated and the stuff that lawsuits are made of, but it's welcoming and worry free; a safe haven for Duncan who begins to come into his own under Owen's coaxing and carefree nature.Over all, the movie evokes so much nostalgia - it must be a movie for those of us who have already gone through the teenage years. Mainly because the plight and emotion which gives the movie most of its appeal, would be lost on a younger generation who lacks hindsight. We know now that these are the years that build us, and the summers that for better or worse are most etched into our memories.You could criticize Rash and Faxon for making weak lead female roles - but you'd quickly realize that it's not a movie that tries to paint a rosy glow, or make things up for the sake of the plot lines. In the end, all stereotypes played out by both genders only make the movie more realistic.As an outsider it would be easy for me to criticize the all-American appeal of this movie, but instead, I'm left wanting more of that elixir that allows you to stand up, take charge and persevere through some of the hardest life lessons. This is such a well written yet simple movie it's hard to accurately pin point just what makes it so excellent - except for the fact that everyone wants to come out on the other side of childhood as their own winner.",The Way Way Back
252,raburnjosif,The greatest movie of the YEAR!!,9,12 September 2013,What do you get when you bring some of the greatest writers from t.v. and have them make a movie together. What do you get? You get the one of the greatest movies of the year! Why you may ask? This movie catches you right at the beginning! You feel sympathy for Duncan right at the start. The way they use character development makes you feel emotion with every one in the movie. Which makes you feel happy and sad when they are! So it has an uplifting toll on you. Also the way they executed it was amazing! the cinematography the soundtrack and the actors were all perfect!! I give this a solid 9/10! So while we wait for the award season coming up. keep this movie in mind.,The Way Way Back

This movie surpassed my high expectations and quite possibly secured its spot as my favorite movie of all time. Each character in this movie was ingenious - from the socially-awkward protagonist, Duncan, or to the water park employee, Louis, who brings laughs every time he appears on screen despite his extremely minor role. Half-way through the movie, I caught myself wishing it wouldn't end; many times, this film portrayed pure happiness that not only showed on screen, but somehow radiated and put a smile on your face, as well. I left the theater with a sort of high that I can't describe.In short, each character in this movie was flawed and realistic, which made you love them even more; in fact, these characters almost over-shadowed the brilliant plot. I personally loved this movie and would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a fun, good-feeling movie that doesn't spare any of the dark, uncomfortable struggles that come with life.",The Way Way Back

The story is mundane with situational plots you can see coming way in advance. I almost wondered if a high school freshman had written the script. The film is filled with transitional scenes accompanied with songs that we must endure much too long. - must have had lots of film to use. The major adult characters are shallow and uncaring - mom shows no real concern to find out who the adult man is that drives her 14-year old son home.

Everything from the start to the end is very real like and very well acted. The reality leads to the strength of the movie and why it works so well!! It is a basic scenario with good parents, bad parents, good kids, bad kids and the good guy/ hero. But, because it doesn't do anything, including the ending to make it seem set up, it works really well. All the actors do a great job for their parts as it was cast perfectly. Between Mya Rudolph, Steve Carrel and the others, no one seems out of place or unrealistic. If you have kids over 12, take them to see it. If you don't, go see it yourselves. More movies like this help everyone understand the difficulties of teenage years and how many of the kids that aren't the most popular struggle to find their way.

256,mgagner,Horrible - Save Yourselves and Stay Home!!,1,29 July 2013,"Why is it when a movie is horrible no one will call it horrible!??! Instead people praise it by saying things like ""It was pure genius how the director masked this masterpiece as a terrible film"". No he didn't... it was truly HORRIBLE!! OK, not the worst film I've ever seen (I always have to leave a little room to have one that's worse!) .. but it's up there! First, its a bit deceptive. You see Steve Carell in the trailer making a few mildly funny comments and you think it will be a comedy (and the guy is in general truly a funny dude) but when you watch the movie, he's a total jerk.The plot is totally predictable, unrealistic, and the characters have little depth, and are overacted! For example, the annoying step-sister is nasty to the brother through the whole movie. The drunk, 50 something neighbor that was hot in 1978 (but not now) is drunk the entire time (as I wish I was!). You hate her, and almost every other character, as soon at the family arrives at the beach house. Oh, also can't forget the hot girl next door who happens to be about the same age as the introverted 15 year old boy. Yes, you can tell immediately that there will be something between the two, but in real life, THAT WOULD NEVER HAPPEN! Now, about the boy. If Slingblade and I don't know who, had a child, he might be like this kid. I know he was supposed to appear awkward and nerdy, but his portrayal made him seem retarded (Oh, I know, don't say retarded, but hey, the movie made fun of a cross-eyed kid, and I was cross-eyed when I was 8, so too bad!!). He barely spoke, and walked like Rainman! I'm not going to rehash the whole story like a lot of other reviewers here did, but, if my catatonic 15 year old boy, rode off on a pink bike, only to return 8 hours later in the convertible of a 40 year old man, I would call the cops, not tell him to wash up for supper!! Stars of the movie: The water park (a real place in MA), the cross-eyed kid, and Sam Rockwell! If you are not into the ""M"" in S&M, STAY AWAY from this movie!!",The Way Way Back
257,cecilcook,Excellent character development.,9,3 August 2013,Surprised that this movie isn't getting much press... I would recommend this to all who want to take their family to a good movie that entertains with a positive message. This would've been one to take my children when they were teens so we could have our long talks on the way home and over the weekend about the how difficult it is to go through teen times when parents are trying to find themselves... Even the mistakes we parents make from which we can recover could be discussed... Each character brought us into their experiences. It wasn't hard to empathize or even be a little agitated with them. This would be a very good movie for a church youth group to watch as a springboard for discussion.,The Way Way Back
258,kennygman,Good movie overall. Enjoyed it.,8,29 August 2013,"Throughout this film, I felt a sense of truth that I don't often encounter in a film. The Way, Way Back is a story of a 15 year old boy named Duncan who lives with his mother now that his parents have split up. His mother and her boyfriend take Duncan and his bratty stepsister to a holiday house to spend the summer but things don't go quite as planned. Duncan is missing his father and wants to spend summer with him. Duncan is a quite, timid boy but just needs a little motivation in this life. After meeting a employee at a local water park, he realises that he can be happy and finds a place where he can call home. The story is touching and compels the viewer to watch more. To know more. The story had good build up and made sense, however my only concern was the ending. The ending was clever and quite adventurous to say the least but, as my critic friend has said, ""I could have thought of a better ending than that!"". I would recommend this movie to whoever fancies a casual, fun and interesting film experience.",The Way Way Back

Rarely do I go to the movies anymore and actually ""feel"" something. This movie takes a teen's point of view of life and puts it on the big screen and in such a way that you want to jump into the screen and punch Trent (Steve Carell) in the throat. It is well written and very well portrayed by all the actors. Nobody stands out more, I don't think, than Sam Rockwell. Rockwell plays Owen, a childish, stuck in the past, water park manager that takes the main character, Duncan, under his wing. Rockwell's performance is phenomenal and is a much needed mood change in the movie. Most of the time you're watching you feel for Duncan. His mother's boyfriend is a total dick and his mother doesn't do much to fix it. He feels alone, much like a lot of the kids his age today. But after meeting Owen at Water Wizz Waterpark and getting a job there, he takes the nickname ""Pop n' Lock"" and he truly comes out of his shell to reveal the great kid that he is.

It does not deserve 7.5. Its rating is a conspiracy by the cinema Illuminati. In my opinion this movies is made for drama family's.

I have not seen a movie along these lines for awhile that has real issues in todays childhood and with our current relationships. You can watch it for the small 'love story' the growth of the main character or just the humour in the situations. I have watched this movie twice and enjoyed it both times, the characters are all great the acting is very well done, especially the lead boy. His acting of the very awkward and shy boy is fantastic his body language is very well done. Steve carrel plays a meaner guy, or I guess more realistic view of many of todays relationships and fathers.

264,notofthisplanet,Grounded and subtle and actually funny,10,20 August 2014,"So many comedies try way too hard to be funny; through either ridiculous slap-stick or forced clichés and puns, you find yourself forcing a laugh because you know it's supposed to be funny, but you're just not feeling it. Well, not this film. The overall mood in this film is not as joyful as many others of the genre, but this makes it feel far more real. The struggles of Duncan are entirely typical and this means the vast majority of people (myself especially) can relate greatly. From being completely clueless on what to say to girls to being incapable of holding conversation with anyone, Duncan is just a normal teen, and the young actor really does this justice (although I suppose he may not have been so much acting a role as much as being himself). Rockwell's playful, but not over the top, banter seems entirely natural and this helps to give the comedy its grounded feel. His jokes are that of a slightly puerile guy with a kind side and not a whole heap of shame. However his shamelessness is not exploited as in, say, the American Pie franchise.Overall, this film is relatable, not irritatingly happy and genuinely funny. Emotionally it is strong, but subtle - there is no huge Romeo- and-Juliet romance and there are no major epiphanies as in many Rom- coms. It is a film that accurately depicts a normal teenage life in a familiar situation, with some great laughs along the way. A great film, I thoroughly recommend you watch it.",The Way Way Back

267,mjrd1978,7.4? Are you kidding me?,5,11 June 2014,"I love movies like this and after watching the previews I was excited to see it. And then I watched it, and it was crap. Duncan was annoying and stayed that way the entire film. Maybe that's how they wanted him to play the character, but he was unlikable. Even when he started to break out of his shell he was still annoying. His back and forth with the blonde neighbor was boring and lacked realistic chemistry. There's no way that little blonde hottie would go for duncans character, there was no reason for her to, what because they both came from broken homes? Sure. The believability of their connection was non existent. Sam Rockwell's character was overkill, the only thing that was really funny was his Footloose reference, everything else he said was awkward and over thought. The break dancing scene was uncomfortable to watch, It looked like something from Saved by the Bell that Zach would have made Screech do at Malibu Sands. The ending was stupid and predictable. I really don't see what everyone loved so much about this movie. I tend to agree with the ratings people give movies on here but this one has me confused.

This was markedly different because the protagonist's friend and confidante was an actual adult. Not another troubled teen, not a parent or relative, but just a guy who could see a 14 year old boy as an actual person with character and personality, and not a ""child"". The only thing that got my goat was that these ""adults"" that the boy was supposed to learn from unabashedly made him partake in the age-old misogynistic tradition of objectifying a woman. Did this really have to be in a movie about a 14 year old kid, learning things? I am tired of this being paraded around as ""harmless fun"".

269,artisticava,the way way back,9,5 August 2020,"This movie opens up with a scene of Steve Carell (Trent) driving a car to with his family talking to our main character Duncan asking him on a scale of 1-10 how he would rank himself before he gets to his beach house in the Hamptons this summer. Duncan says he thinks he is a 6 this is then followed by Trent ignoring this comment and telling him that he thinks he is a 3 and then telling him all the reasons why he is a 3. While all of this is occurring his mom is asleep in the passenger seat next to Trent and Trent's daughter is listening to loud music thus, Trent is all alone in the way way back. He is both physically trapped in the car, in the Hamptons, with these people and this is what this movie is going to be about how he is going to be miserable until he can break free and become his own man. This is what appeals to the viewer of the movie that the setup within 1 minute of this film has become aware its a real life scenario where life sucks and you need to deal with it best you can.
Throughout the film we continuously see how awful Trent treats Duncan, how he almost feeds off of how miserable Duncan is and how Duncan's mom is completely ignoring this situation because she would rather pretend Trent is a good guy. Lines are often thrown out like Trent just cares about you when she has really just chosen to become oblivious to the matter but this is a coming of age film so there is of course a turning point for Duncan. One Afternoon Duncan takes a bike from the shed and finds freedom exploring all over the seashore until happening upon somewhere new, Water Wizz. This water park tis far different than the uptight Manhattan snobs on their private beaches and more his speed. More importantly it is here that he finds Owen, his guide and his mentor/friendship into ""cutting your own path,"" and ""not taking life"" too seriously. Duncan needs these lessons, this job and this new family of coworkers more than ever before because everyone else in his life has all but abandoned him. The people in the Hamptons are mostly awful aside from one or two and he is all alone.

Duncan's mentor and manager shines through his on your face, unapologetic funny moments and is hysterical all the way. Sadly, only depressing fragments of the movie was Steve Carall's presence as a sadist mean two dimensional character which was a letdown to this stature of an actor.Duncan's character portrayed by Liam James is very effective in portraying his inner turmoil and awkwardness.

271,mhallows,"A deeply warming, sentimental coming of age tale",8,28 November 2019,"The Way Way Back is one of those films of which you go in with little expectation and go out with a sentiment of warmth, positivity and happiness. This movie surpassed my expectations on a multitude of levels. This movie promotes itself as a hybridisation of a comedy, drama and coming of age flick and delivers emphatically. What surprised me was the deep emotional undertones which are layed out from the get go of the movie which insinuate at more mature themes of broken relationships and strained family situations. Although the movie has the exterior appearance of a comedy the narrative is laced with morals of self-acceptance and going ""on your own way"" cutting your own paths.Duncan (the 14 year old protagonist) visibly ticks the archetype of the awkward, anti-social teenage boy, finding his way in life. From the beginning scene this is represented via the mise en scene of the movie, including elements of body language, facial expression and his bland, rudimentary outfit. During the discussion with Duncan and Trent (Steve Carell), Duncan's mothers new boyfriend, the dialogue indicates clear tension between the pair, paving down the foundations of the over-arching narrative of the movie.What gives this film even more depth is the somewhat circular narrative when comparing the start scene and the ending scene. This film is also not naive and cliché in that not everything ends up perfect by the climax of the movie. There are still questions left unanswered. This aspect is refreshing and mature and more accurately represents the real world - allowing for more of a connection with the audience and empathy felt for the characters.The sub-narratives and relationships that Duncan builds throughout the movie adds much depth. Especially, his relationship with Owen, (Sam Rockwell) an immature, lively, Waterwizz world staff member who plays the role of a father figure for Duncan. He takes Duncan under his wing and watching this relationship develop and cultivate over the course of the movie is very refreshing. The romantic side to the movie with the Susanna (AnnaSophia Robb) and Duncan is also endearing as Duncan progresses and gains confidence, finding himself and talking with her adding exposition to the movie, context and depth to both characters respectively. Betty (Allison Janney) allows for some great comedic scenes, facilitating a wonderful balance of comedy, romance and drama. Whereas Pam, (Toni Collette) also does well with her believable, grounded performance of a mother in between a rock and a hard place.Altogether the mixture of great acting, direction, emotional depth and comedy create the perfect amalgamation in the creation of a phenomenal coming of age movie, not overly-pretentious, but raw and credible. This movie is a fantastic hidden gem that I would highly recommend to anyone.",The Way Way Back

273,douvil,"His story is a basic coming of age story about a young, shy boy that doesn't quite know where he fits in the world",7,2 August 2016,"Duncan (Liam James) is a 14-year-old boy who doesn't have many ambitions in life. His story is a basic coming of age story about a young, shy boy that doesn't quite know where he fits in the world. He is forced to go on vacation with his mom Pam (Toni Collette), her boyfriend Trent (Steve Carell), and Trent's daughter Steph (Zoe Levin). Duncan doesn't like Trent because he spends a lot of his time making him miserable with his condescending remarks and actions. This only leads Duncan to search for a way out of Trent's beach house. Duncan finds a little girl's pink bike in the garage and he takes off to explore. He rides through the town as happy as we have seen him throughout the entire movie. He ends up stumbling upon the Water Wizz where his life is about to change. He befriends Owen (Sam Rockwell) and he learns how to have confidence in himself and what it's like to have someone take him under their wing. He becomes friends with the entire staff and all the patrons of the park. Meanwhile, Duncan is also building a relationship with the girl next door, Susanna (AnnaSophia Robb) who under normal circumstances, he would be too shy to talk too. The directors, Nat Faxon and Jim Rash, did a fantastic job of working with Duncan to make him seem as awkward as they could. They really had to sell that point in order to make the theme of this movie work. His posture, the way he carries himself, and even his tone of voice makes him look and sound inferior to others. I also enjoyed the sound effects of this movie, such as the off-screen sounds and the music. The music was always correlated to the tempo of the story. If Duncan was upset because of Trent, they played sad, slow music. When he was riding the bike through town or at the water park the music was faster/ more upbeat so we would feel happy with him. When Duncan is first exploring the town, he stops at a local pizza parlor and as soon as he walks in we can hear the sounds of a Pac-Man game in the background. The game is being played by Owen at the other end of the restaurant. The game draws Duncan in and starts a conversation between the two of them, which will eventually be the beginning of their friendship. This movie does a wonderful job of portraying what is it like to be a young boy and the obstacles he has to overcome as he ages. It depicts normal problems that lots of children have to deal with, just like the movie Sixteen Candles. Samantha is trying to figure out where she fits in her world as well. To make matters worse, her entire family forgets her 16th birthday because of her sister's wedding, but she does get her a wonderful surprise at the end of the movie. She gets her birthday kiss from the boy she has a crush on, Jake. Duncan doesn't like his mother's boyfriend, but because of Trent's beach house, he has the best summer of his life. Duncan also gets his kiss from Susanna at the end of the movie, as well. After all is said and done with, Duncan is able to overcome his shyness and see his true worth. He may not know exactly where he fits in, but he is in a much better place than he was at the beginning of the movie.",The Way Way Back
