0,SnoopyStyle,cops are a problem,6,18 May 2021,"Child psychiatrist Anna Fox (Amy Adams) is depressed and agoraphobic. She lives alone in her Boston home. Her husband (Anthony Mackie) and daughter had left her. David (Wyatt Russell) is her tenant living in the basement. The Russell family (Fred Hechinger, Gary Oldman, Julianne Moore, Jennifer Jason Leigh) has moved in across the street. Anna witnesses a murder and calls the cops. Detective Little (Brian Tyree Henry) and Detective Norelli (Jeanine Serralles) do not believe her.Cops are often a problem in thrillers like this. They are made to look stupid for the sake of the plot. In this one, they come in hot and fast, dismissing her in the most arrogant way. It doesn't make sense even if she's wrong in some of the details. That first interaction derails an otherwise intriguing Rear Window wannabe. I am willing to buy that the cops grow distrustful of her story as they investigate more but their first meeting can't be like that. It's working too hard to be Kafkaesque. It needs to build to that. In the end, I can appreciate this despite that glaring misstep. It has great actors and an intriguing style with its premise.",The Woman in the Window
1,kosmasp,The woman beside herself/window,8,17 May 2021,"Yes if you are an avid movie fan and like thrillers, you should be aware of Hitchcock! Actually if you only want to watch one movie with someone bound to their apartment (for a different reason, but who's counting), make it Hitchcocks Rear Window! Having said that, this movie makes no secret where it draws its inspriration from ... right at the start you'll see a screen on the left that has a scene from said Hitchcock movie.Now just paying tribute or acknowledging the master does not make this a good movie. And I totally understand if some do not like this at all. It is a bit messy ... like the lead character. For me it was predictable to a certain extent ... and still I liked the way it handled itself and went on to reveal things slowly.So if you can overcome certain flaws this certainly has and just enjoy the thrill of it all, you may be able to have a good time (pun intended)",The Woman in the Window
2,Sleepin_Dragon,Very average unfortunately.,6,18 September 2021,"A housebound woman witnesses a brutal act in the house opposite, but is all as it seems?I have read the book, it's a great book, this is a moderately good adaptation of it. The issue here, was the pacing, at times it felt very dragged out, with some overlong scenes, and crazily long pauses, there's tension, and then there's overly slow, this couldn't find the balance.We've had the woman on the train, and at times this just felt like a rehashed version of that, only that was much better.I did think the acting was first rate, and despite such an illustrious cast, I did think that Amy Adams was the real standout.It's watchable, I wanted it to be great, 6/10.",The Woman in the Window
3,classicsoncall,"""Everyone else can move on. I can't!""",8,19 May 2021,"I thought the film did a good job of building tension and paranoia for Amy Adams' character, Anna Fox. Having her portray a child psychologist though, didn't seem to make sense, since you would think that a doctor wouldn't be caught up in so much delusion, except for the loss of her family impinging on her psyche. The twist with the phony Jane Russell (Julianne Moore) was a neat touch, and the picture had a way of stringing the viewer along trying to understand how Anna could have gotten things so wrong when the authorities got involved. There was a very cool and stylized blood splatter scene witnessed by Anna as she spied on the Russell apartment, a situation that had Hitchcock's ""Rear Window"" written all over it. What's never accounted for when the story concludes were whether Alistair (Gary Oldman) and the 'real' Jane Russell (Jennifer Jason Leigh) ever reconciled with the fact that their son was a serial murderer. One would hope that with the passage of time, Dr. Fox resolves her guilt and angst over the death of her husband and daughter, since except for the tragedy, she had all the qualities of a promising young woman.P. S. Who knows a psychiatrist who makes house calls?",The Woman in the Window
4,lee_eisenberg,not great but worth seeing,7,1 June 2021,"""The Woman in the Window"" is not a remake of ""Rear Window"". It deals more with questioning one's sanity (whether or not this involves gaslighting). Not a masterpiece, but worth seeing.",The Woman in the Window
5,blanche-2,"A little Rear Window, a little Witness to Murder, a little Copycat, and a hat tip to Hitch",7,28 May 2021,"Amy Adams stars in ""The Woman in the Window"" from 2021 (actually made in 2018), along with Gary Oldman, Fred Hechinger,Julianne Moore,Jennifer Jason Leigh, Wyatt Russell, and Brian Tyree Henry. The screenplay is by Tracy Letts.First things first, I didn't read the book, so my review will have nothing to do with it.Anna Fox is a child psychologist, who, after a tragedy, has become an agoraphobic, pill-popping alcoholic who lives in a dark New York City house with her cat, Punch. She spies on her neighbors and checks them out on the Internet.She befriends a boy from across the street, Ethan (Hechinger) who brings her a gift from his mother. Later, a woman (Julianne Moore) visits Anna. She seems to be Ethan's mother, Jane Russell.Anna is uneasy about Ethan, because after watching their apartment, she thinks his father is intimidating and worries about the boy. The, through her window, she sees Jane stabbed by someone.However, the police don't believe her. Jane's husband (Russell) is livid with her and introduces her to his wife Jane (Leigh) - obviously not the woman Anna met. Despite her protests to the police, Anna is clearly written off as a nut.I actually thought this a very good and effective film. I mentioned Copycat in my subject - I am referring to a very good film starring Sigourney Weaver from some years back. There were elements of it, as well as the obvious homage to Rear Window and the Stanwyck film Witness to Murder.In short, The Woman in the Window is derivative, but still good, with quite a surprising ending. I thought the acting was terrific. Amy Adams, a very pretty woman, manages to look bloated with bags under her eyes in this, which is perfect for the role.One thing I loved were the film references, to Dark Passage, Laura, and Spellbound, as well as the name ""Jane Russell"", and that spiral staircase that screamed Vertigo.I highly recommend this film. I know people who read the book hated it, but if you didn't, I think you'll like it.",The Woman in the Window
6,BandSAboutMovies,The story of the story is better than the story,3,8 September 2021,"Between Nocturnal Animals, Sharp Objects and this, is Amy Adams kinda becoming a giallo queen? Or just a woman in danger of being killed and/or going insane? Umm, isn't that a giallo queen?You know what also seems like a mystery worth digging into? The writer of the book that this was based on, A. J. Finn, is really a book editor named Dan Mallory who may or may not have lied in regards to - according to this New Yorker article - having a doctorate from Oxford, multiple family and personal cancer battles and he death of his still-alive father, mother and brother. Plus, there are allegations that he took on the identity of his brother to send emails about a fake cancer condition - fake online identities are part of the story of The Woman in the Window - and that pretty much the entire story of The Woman in the Window didn't come from his imagination.The article then presents us with a summary of a story: ""An American woman in mid-career, a psychologist with a Ph. D. and professional experience of psychopathy, is trapped in her large home by agoraphobia. She has been there for about a year, after a personal trauma. If she tries to go outside, the world spins. She drinks too much, and recklessly combines alcohol and anti-anxiety medication. Police officers distrust her judgment. Online, she plays chess and contributes to a forum for stress-sufferers, a place where danger lies.""Yes, that could be this movie. But it's also the 1995 Sigourney Weaver-starring film Copycat.And it's also very similar to Sarah A. Denzil's Saving April, including an identical ending.So yes, the world has many magical moments and I believe in the collective unconsciousness, but this is too much to bear.Maybe we should just discuss the movie before I'm tempted to dish on my own experiences with people who continually reached out to me with personal narratives that were easily disproven.Anna Fox lives alone in Manhattan after separating from her husband Edward who lives somewhere else with their daughter - can you guess this plot twist? - and her agoraphobia, prescriptions and alcohol abuse keep her inside the house. Yet one night, she meets her new next-door neighbor Jane Russell (Julianne Moore) and her son Ethan, who seems abused.Then, like Rear Window, she watches Jane die at the hands of her husband Alastair (Gary Oldman). When she calls the cops, she meets Jane again, who is now Jennifer Jason Leigh and reality starts to be untrustworthy for our protagonist.You know how in Scream they make fun of the cliches of slashers while still following them? Like somehow it's just fine to make the same narrative choices as long as you reference them? That's what Anna's collection of Hitchcock films is all about. So if you show scenes from Spellbound, Dark Passage and Laura - as well as Rear Window - you can take as much as you want. Someone get Argento and DePalma on the phone and let them know that critics who took them to task just for referencing so much Hitchcock that if they had only had some clips and hammered home references, all would have been fine.There's also Anna's slightly sleazy boarder David Winter (Wyatt Russell, somehow always a jerk in movies) and the police who are no help - hello, this is a giallo - with Detective Little (Brian Tyree Henry) only coming around to Anna's truth by the end of the film.You know, they should just make the life of Dan Mallory into a movie.But then everyone would think it was ripped off from The Talented Mr. Ripley.",The Woman in the Window
7,Calicodreamin,Slow,5,18 May 2021,"While a solidly twisty end, this movie was just too darn slow. A lot of periphery scenes that didn't add much and the final ten minutes felt wildly out of place. Adams' acting was good, and she looked suitably disheveled for a woman hopped on booze and pills. This was just underwhelming as a psychological thriller.",The Woman in the Window
8,ferguson-6,at least Amy Adams delivers,5,14 May 2021,"Greetings again from the darkness. Agoraphobia (the fear of leaving one's home) has been the topic of a few films over the years, but for whatever reason, none of them have really clicked. Of course, director Alfred Hitchcock brilliantly used a wheelchair-bound James Stewart to create his tension-packed classic REAR WINDOW (1954); however, there's a psychological difference in being stuck at home due to injury, and being mentally and emotionally unable to bring yourself to walk out the front door due to anxiety and fear. Controversial author/editor AJ Finn (pseudonym of Dan Mallory) wrote a 2018 best-selling debut novel around this affliction, and now Tracy Letts has adapted the novel for the screen and director Joe Wright (DARKEST HOUR 2017, ATONEMENT 2007).Amy Adams stars as Anna Fox, a child psychologist suffering from agoraphobia after a horrible car accident. She never leaves her Brownstone. She has groceries and prescription drugs delivered to her door, and conducts business over the phone. She has also mastered the internet and memorized dialogue from numerous classic films. Anna also spends an inordinate amount of time spying ... um, observing ... her neighbors through the window. Anna has a pet cat, and also a tenant living in her basement. We don't learn much about David (Wyatt Russell) until later in the film.The story is broken down by the days of the week, and begins with Monday when Anna meets Ethan (Fred Hechinger), the son of the Russells who just moved in across the street. On Tuesday, Anna meets the character played by Julianne Moore, and the two have a chat about her son Ethan, in addition to bonding over wine ... a beverage of frequent choice for Anna. On Wednesday and Thursday, all heck breaks loose as Anna hears a scream and witnesses a stabbing in the home of her new neighbors. The cops don't believe her and Ethan's dad, Alistair Russell (Gary Oldman), shows up accusing her of lying, boozing, and hallucinating on prescription drugs. It's not a pretty sight for Anna.The first hour does a nice job of setting the scene for Anna and her struggles, plus creating confusion and misdirection on what she's experiencing and ""seeing"" in regards to the situation in the Russell home across the street. We get a feel for the strange dynamic with David, the phone calls with her husband Ed (Anthony Mackie), and her therapy sessions with Dr. Landy (screenwriter Tracy Letts). It's really Act 3 where things went off the rails for me. It seemed there was an attempt to cram too much into too short of time. The ending is clear and helps us make sense of everything that has come before; however, it just came across as forced, and out of step with what we had watched in the first hour.Other supporting roles include Brian Tyree Henry as a Detective, and Jennifer Jason Leigh. In fact, the stellar cast includes two Oscar winners in Julianne Moore and Gary Oldman, a previous Oscar nominee in Jennifer Jason Leigh, and of course, Amy Adams, who has six Oscar nominations. Ms. Adams carries most of the movie with yet another terrific performance, while the others really aren't given much to do. It's rare for me to say this, but I believe the material would have been better served as a two- or three-parter, rather than a relatively short movie. It was initially delayed in 2019 for re-shoots and a re-edit, and then again in 2020 due to COVID. I might have been somewhat disappointed in the final project, but I suspect this will be hugely popular on Netflix.Premieres on Netflix on May 14, 2021.",The Woman in the Window
9,lasttimeisaw,Cinema Omnivore - The Woman in the Window (2021) 6.4/10,6,17 May 2021,"""Set up as a single-location thriller, patterning over Hitchcock's REAR WINDOW (1954), the film asks our housebound heroine Anna Fox (Adams), a child psychiatrist, to play amateur sleuth, after she chances upon witnessing a murder across the street. For one thing, director Joe Wright (whose career is on a slippery slope) maxes out the limited spatiality to pleasingly chromatic effects, the whole movie boasts a sleek sheen which dazzles while the plot either meanders or skitters, and informs you where its money is spent (other than the paycheck for its stellar cast). Oddly, the ambience is ambivalent, the murderous intention or act has no threatening air, as if what you are watching is a prestige drama of a woman fighting for her sanity, and the reveal of the killer is hurried and he is such a featherweight menace to cow even a beaten woman like Anna, and the rickety rooftop has already suggested his slipshod downfall.""",The Woman in the Window
10,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,Imperfect but still suspenseful thrillers the somwt,7,14 June 2021,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningFollowing a traumatic incident, child psychologist Anna Fox (Amy Adams) now lives a reclusive life in her New York apartment, with only her cat and downstairs co tenant David (Wyatt Russell) for company. After an encounter with Ethan (Fred Hechinger), a young man who lives across the road, she becomes convinced he's being abused by his father, Alistair (Gary Oldman), before witnessing what she believes is a brutal murder. She finds herself plunged into a nightmarish scenario, where her very sanity is pushed over the edge.The snoopiness of neurotic single women is becoming a common theme in modern thrillers, after 2016's The Girl On the Train, and now this film with an almost similar title, and similarly adapted from a potentially far superior novel. A lot of us are sometimes guilty of staring out the window and imagining the lives of those we see pass by, or who live across from us, but there's always the chance we'll see something horrific, but could our minds play tricks on us, and how will how people see us affect how we're seen?Director Joe Wright constructs a tight, claustrophobic atmosphere in the narrow, confined space of Anna's apartment, in the dark gloom of night, with her mounting paranoia and agoraphobia closing in on her. As the protagonist in question, Adams creates a convincing aura about her as a lone, emotionally unstable woman, while in support Oldman is barely contained, his trademark intensity blaring through, and even Anthony Mackie shines in a walk on supporting role.There is a genuine desire to find out how it all gets resolved, and while it never really comes together in the most intriguing or explosive manner it could have, it still takes you on a nice little journey of suspense while it lasts. ***",The Woman in the Window
11,MOscarbradley,Trash but trash of a very enjoyable kind.,7,15 May 2021,"Sometimes it's nice to see a director normally given over to highfalutin literary-based works slumming it which is precisely what Joe Wright is doing here. ""The Woman in the Window"" is another literary adaptation, (it's from an A. J. Finn novel), but it's a far less po-faced one than Wright usually gives us. In fact, as adapted by Tracy Letts, this is just a slice of grand guignol and it's great fun, referencing Hitchcock, (most obviously ""Rear Window""), and film noir in general.Amy Adams is the agoraphobic former child psychologist who spends her time spying on her new neighbours who all seem to be as loopy as she is and, of course, if you've seen ""Rear Window"", and who hasn't, you know what happens next; right, murder most foul though it's at this point that things start to diverge from Hitchcock's masterpiece. Did Amy really see a murder or is she as mad as a hatter?Since we've seen variations on these themes countless times before, this is where the guessing games begin and if the punchline is a little less effective than it might have been you can always chalk it down to that old saying 'there's nothing new under the sun'. Adams, of course, is terrific and is ably backed up by those fine actors Gary Oldman and Julianne Moore, (but don't expect too much from Jennifer Jason Leigh who seems to have been denied permission to speak in this movie). It's trash or at best, pulp fiction; a junk-food movie from a man who, in the past, fancied himself something of a Michelin Star chef and I really enjoyed it.",The Woman in the Window
12,Cineanalyst,Window Peeping Through Acting and Cinema,5,14 May 2021,"I'm not sure what to be more impressed by and subsequently disappointed from: the stellar cast and even crew of ""The Woman in the Window"" or its barrage of references to classic cinema. Amy Adams, Julianne Moore, Gary Oldman, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Anthony Mackie and the other new Captain America (Wyatt Russell)--great lineup. Behind the camera, too, Joe Wright has a solid resume of intriguingly reflexive adaptations (""Pride & Prejudice"" (2005), ""Atonement"" (2007), ""Anna Karenina"" (2012)), and this one is based on a popular (or notorious now) novel, too, as adapted by the playwright Tracy Letts, who also plays the shrink protagonist's shrink on screen, which is kind of neat. Five-time Oscar-nominated cinematographer Bruno Delbonnel knows how to make a movie trapped in an apartment look nice, as well.As for the old film references, the obvious one is ""Rear Window"" (1954)--only the umpteenth movie to do so--and, indeed, early on the camera pans past an image of James Stewart being strangled by Raymond Burr from that Hitchcock masterpiece. There's also the similar, female-centered ""Witness to Murder"" (also from 1954), and clips from noirs such as ""Laura"" (1944) and ""Dark Passage"" (1947), to go along with the murder-mystery plot. Plus, the title it shared with the 1944 Fritz Lang noir, and the ending here seems to throw more Hitchcock at the wall in a poor man's Brian De Palma sort of way, with allusions to ""Psycho"" (1960) slashing and ""Vertigo"" (1958)-inducing heights. There's probably more than that, too, which I'm missing (and I'll get to a couple of them). Either way, it's not enough to anchor the production alone. It just reminds me of better films I'd rather revisit.And, I'm just going to gloss over the easy parallel to the real-world pandemic of a movie about staying-in-place and for which its release was delayed by the pandemic, along with the Disney-Fox merger and the subsequent selling off to Netflix for streaming at home. All of that was inadvertent and not as interesting.If anything makes this worth seeing it's for the meeting between two of today's greatest actresses, Adams and Moore. That scene is terrific--just the best at their craft playing off each other with some promising material of acting as characters whom we aren't sure if they, too, are acting, whether straight falsehoods or mere withholding, and employing media (drawing and photography) within the art form of motion pictures to go along with the actors-playing-actors. Moore even adopts the name ""Jane Russell,"" while going blonde no less (""Gentlemen Prefer Blondes"" (1953)), as in the classic Hollywood star whose image appears when Adams's protagonist later Googles her. Moreover, this scene is followed up by a second Jane Russell, and it's Jennifer Jason Leigh, of all people, in that doubled role, which must be an intentional allusion to her part in ""Single White Female"" (1992). Great casting, and it's all downhill from there.This is simply too overly concerned with plotting--exposition dumps, extensive gaslighting, red herrings and silly twists galore. I wonder what it looked like before the reported complaints of it being confusing after test screenings and the subsequent reshoots, because as is, I find it exceedingly simplistic. Convoluted, yes, but excruciating in how it's all explained in dull detail. And, egads, Danny Elfman's constant and obvious tense underscoring of the drama is a nuisance. Making it worse, there are a couple shots of Adams spying on one of her neighbors practicing playing music, as it's drowned out by Elfman's incessantness. The shots of the band kid are clearly an homage to the musician providing the diegetic score to ""Rear Window."" It's rather pathetic how poor this diametrically opposed musical accompaniment is to the sparing scoring in the 1954 classic, let alone the iconic fuller ones from Bernard Herrmann in ""Psycho"" and ""Vertigo."" I have no problem, per se, with blatantly mirroring another movie, but if the pastiche is bad, being adjacent to one of the most ingenious films ever made is only going to compound, or highlight, it by flaunting how awful it is in comparison.""Rear Window,"" nor the other Hitchcock favorites, are milestones in film history simply because they featured intriguing murder mysteries or whatever plots. Hitchcock and company understood cinematic voyeurism perhaps like no other. Laura Mulvey's theorizing of the ""male gaze"" in her essay ""Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema"" is practically based on Hitch's oeuvre, with all the psychologizing included. Stewart's characters' various broken limbs or Norman Bates's mommy issues as peeping Tom display of castration anxiety and manifestation of spectatorial impotence. ""Rear Window,"" in particular, was a marvel for building an entire film's world around the camera and, thus, through our identification with the camera's point of view, the film's spectator--a universe that does revolve around us. This was further articulated by the windows serving as the frame for the films-within-films of the neighbors' activities, as the camera occupied the same apartment as Stewart, thus also aligning spectator identification with his protagonist. Stewart's character was a photographer to emphasize that point. He was the camera; the camera is us.So cinematically revolutionary was it that it almost seems as though ""Rear Window,"" besides providing ample material for thousands of student papers (including some of mine) and professor publications over the years, has spawned a genre of its own of imitators: from the classics-in-their-own right ""Blow-Up"" (1966), The Conversation"" (1974), ""Blue Velvet"" (1986), to so many De Palma films, and also-rans ""The Burbs"" (1989), ""Disturbia"" (2007), ""Wakefield"" (2017), ""The Neighbors' Window"" (2019), and now this, ""The Woman in the Window."" The first obvious difference between the two pictures is gender. Instead of the sex and objectification of the male gaze, then, we get a woman's impotence in childrearing and maintaining a family. This is even reflected in her profession as a shrink for kids and supposedly explains--not unlike Stewart's vertigo--her agoraphobia. Make what you will that this is the female perspective on voyeurism--the pun of breaking the glass ceiling included--as written and directed by men.Moving on, we get the added reflexivity of real movies within the movie proper, as viewed on home video by the protagonist in her late night, wine-and-pills-induced stupors. There's a nice symmetry here that these films are interrupted by the neighbors' window as movies. Unfortunately, though, the neighbors come and go from her apartment so frequently that the effect is rather lost. Similarly, her use of the camera in the story is so sparing it doesn't work beyond another obvious homage to ""Rear Window."" The way the actual camera recording the movie itself explores the apartment, it, too, somewhat undermines its association with the protagonist and, thus, the spectator. At best, it's something of its own character--sometimes sharing the perspective of Adams and sometimes her internal, psychological view, at other times wandering around the rooms beside her, and sometimes just taking the usual ""invisible"" approach of mere observer. It's like ""The Woman in the Window"" overall--all over the place while, ultimately, not going much of anywhere.",The Woman in the Window
13,851222,Great actors. Terrible movie,4,1 June 2021,"Greetings from Lithuania.""The Woman in the Window"" (2021) was a bad film. It features gazillion of great actors, Oscar winners and etc. And yet failed at crucial things - screenplay and directing. This movie was boring, uninvolving, badly written and directed and also i would dare to say - terribly acted by some great performers (Mr. Oldman for example). This whole flick was an easy paycheck for these greats. The story was predictable and boring that even at running time 1 h 40 min this movie dragged terribly.Overall, ""The Woman in the Window"", clearly inspired by the great ""Rear Window"" is a bad movie.

17,eddie_baggins,Should've stayed inside,2,20 May 2021,"Filmed all the way back in 2018 and victim to subsequent re-shoots after middling test screenings and then halted by further set-backs thanks to everyone's old friend Covid-19, Oscar nominated director Joe Wright's big screen treatment of A. J Finn's best-selling novel has finally seen the light of day after Netflix jumped at the chance to distribute this A-list infused thriller but like that empty feeling you get watching out your window for that package you ordered online to come only for it to never arrive, Wright's film is a bitterly disappointing exercise that sees the colours of all involved lowered.It feels horrible to bash a film with the always great Amy Adams in the lead role but despite her valiant attempts at bringing the tough to understand or like agoraphobic (hates outdoors) New Yorker Anna Fox to life, Adams can do nothing but slip into the background of an increasingly uninteresting thriller that tries desperately to be a modern day Rear Window only to fail in all ways, as Wright loses control of his film and his audience as Woman becomes a film that makes little sense and completely misses the mark when it comes too making us care.Initially very early on we are lulled into a false sense of what might lay in store for us as we are introduced to the sad apartment bound life of Fox who lives out her days watching her neighbourhood and spending time with her cat but once her new neighbours the Russell's move in, Fox's life takes a turn for the more eventful as she suspects not all is as it seems with her idealistic seeming new acquaintances, but very quickly the film gives way to insane plot developments and scenarios and therefore gives its viewers very little too hold onto in the way of a meaningful reason too care.In many ways both in an energy sense and execution sense this is Joe Wright's poorest film yet in a career that has had a few downs but also a few big ups and its odd to think a director that bought so much to films like Hanna, Pride and Prejudice and Atonement could bring so little to a potentially pulpy good time thriller and his poor work behind the camera is reflective in front of it with a name brand cast like Gary Oldman, Julianne Moore and Anthony Mackie all unable to do anything but be participants in a mismanaged affair that is neither thrilling or mysterious.With Netflix jumping in to save the film from likely further obscurity since its troubled foundation set it on the path to failure, we can at least be thankful we were saved from a trip to the cinema under the false pretences of an A-grade thriller featuring some of Hollywood's most reliable citizens as we can now fall safely asleep on our coaches at home with no cost to bare as we forget the wasted potential of a film that promised a lot and delivered very little.Final Say -A heartless and dull exercise that neither gets the pulse racing or brain ticking over, The Woman in the Window should've stayed inside as there's unlikely to be many fans it encounters out here in the great wide world.1 garden tool out of 5.",The Woman in the Window

21,lisafordeay,Well i enjoyed it solely for Amy Adams,7,15 May 2021,"The Woman In The Window is a 2021 Netflix/20th Century Studios (formally 20th Century Fox) thriller starring Amy Adams, Gary Oldman,Jennifer Jason Leigh,Julianne Moore,Anthony Mackie and Wyatt Russell. Directed by Joe Wright who also directed Atonement and Pride And Prejudice, the movie is about a former doctor named Anna Fox(Adams) who suffers from agoraphobia and depression. She lives across the street from the Russell family near Boston. But when she later witnesses a murder in the Russell family,with a woman named Jane Russell(Julliane Moore),Anna rings the police about it. But is the woman really Jane that died or is the real Jane Russell(Jennifer Jason Leigh) still alive and Anna is just hallucinating due to the pills she is taking.The main reason I wanted to see this film was because of Amy Adams. I've always loved her ever since Enchanted(which introduced me to her back in 2007) and in my opinion she is the most underrated actress ever. She never won an Oscar and it still baffles me why. The twists are good and half the time I kept saying is this an Alfred Hitchcock film. If your a fan of Amy Adams then do check it out now on Netflix.Anthony Mackie plays her deceased husband who died in a car crash.",The Woman in the Window
22,jtindahouse,A book that wasn't designed to be made into a film and it shows,6,15 May 2021,"I've read the book of 'The Woman in the Window' and could remember the basic premise but could not for the life of me remember the outcome. So I actually got to experience this same mystery twice effectively. I find that almost all stories work better in book form than movie form, however 'The Woman in the Window' is as much a case of that as you'll ever see. The concept simply didn't work in movie form.It was too condensed for one thing. I couldn't believe how little screen time the side characters got. They are the main pieces in the puzzle that is the mystery at the heart of the story. And yet you'd be forgiven for forgetting they exist for a large portion of the film. Add in how incredibly strong the supporting cast is and it becomes even more of a waste. How did they get such big names for such small and effectively meaningless parts? Jennifer Jason Leigh is an Oscar nominated actress and she was reduced to this role. I can't fathom it.We are left with Amy Adams for pretty much the entirety of the film to carry it on her shoulders. Luckily she is a strong enough actress to hold things together - just. I can't help feeling though that this just wasn't a book that leant inself to movie form. With the success of it it was always going to be made into one, however I think it was a poisoned chalice. I'm glad I got to see this on Netflix and didn't have to go out to cinemas for it. It's watchable, but also highly forgettable. Read the book instead I suggest.",The Woman in the Window

Now I wish I could say the same for everybody else, but others are underused or just sleepwalking. Although Julianne Moore does pretty well for a small role, but Gary Oldman is poorly underused, and Jennifer Jason Leigh looks like she's sleepwalking through this.

24,kevin_robbins,This is a thorough movie worth your time but not a perfect movie,8,5 June 2021,"The Woman in the Window (2021) is a movie recently added to Netflix. The storyline focuses on a woman who suffered a horrific accident and has been scared to leave her house ever since. One night she invites a new neighbor into her house and after the neighbor leaves she believes she sees her neighbor's husband kill her. With no evidence and based on her current condition no one believes her. This movie is directed by Joe Wright (Pride & Prejudice and Atonement) and stars Amy Adams (Man of Steel), Gary Oldman (The Professional), Julianne Moore (Magnolia) and Anthony Mackie (Hurt Locker). The storyline for this is an obvious remake of Rear Window. Some aspects that they refreshed were very well done, specifically the ending and character storylines, which are fantastic. However, some elements did not work like for someone so paranoid, she did let a lot of awkward, strange people in her house, with it just being her and them. I loved the subplots and the delivery of her history and how she got where she is subtly throughout the movie until the end when both storylines come crashing together. Overall, this is a thorough movie worth your time but not a perfect movie. Id score this a very solid 8/10 and strongly recommend seeing it.",The Woman in the Window

A new family move in over the road and Adams meets them one at a time. She then witnesses a violent attack in their apartment but cannot get anyone to believe her story.Very Hitchcockian in tone and with clear similarities to Rear Window, the bare bones of the story are fine, albeit not wholly unpredictable. Where it goes awry is the excessive use of melodrama - hardly anyone stops crying or shouting and the insistence by director Wright on endless clever shots, imagery and general cinematic trickery. These are largely distractions to what, when all said and done is an adequate albeit unlikely and occasional twisty turny thriller with an impressive cast.

31,questl-18592,Rear Window: The Really Bad Cut,2,20 May 2021,"Oh this movie made me mad. So so mad. Everything about it just annoyed the bejesus out of me but lets start things off with the... Oh wait, I don't have any positives! Well, it looks pretty sometimes is a half positive. Only half because while it looks pretty the shots make no sense at all and lead into one of my first negatives.WHAT IS THIS HOUSE!? It's GIGANTIC! It's like a corner building in the middle of the city with at least 4-5 floors and it's massive. I don't know that we ever learn what the husband did but Adams said she was a child psychologist and unless she was this movie's version of Dr Phil they are not affording this monstrosity and I'm just not buying it! Also, the house is enormous but always massively rundown, which I get the feeling is supposed to be representative of her psychological state but I don't care because it was annoying me to no end.Secondly! Amy Adams, Gary Oldman, Anthony Mackie, Julianne Moore, Jennifer Jason Leigh. This is a cast stacked with talent and the performances felt AWFUL! The dialogue in here is atrociously bad, with people fast talking into and over each other in a remarkably clunky fashion from scene one. Oldman is doing this weird accent, Adams is trying to throw some gravitas in but with that script it's tough to manage. Moore isn't here long enough to make any sort of difference and still feels weird. All around though it just feels like a clunky, amateur mess.Third, this is a movie that wants to be clever and I managed to call it within the first 20 minutes and that's rough on something that thinks it's this clever. That might not 100% be the movie's fault but I'm dinging it for a lack of originality.It's too inconsistent and more worried about being artsy than making any sort of sense and that irritates me to death. There are movies that can pull that off though, Mother! Is pure art with no cohesive storyline or plot and I love it but in a movie like this I need a throughline or some sort of cohesion to make this mystery feel worth while and there's just nothing here to grab hold of and invest in.Even though this is ""free"" on Netflix, don't watch this. This is garbage. It's the sort of trashy movie that would find a lot of time on circulation on daytime network tv but isn't worth actually seeking out.",The Woman in the Window
32,dierregi,Cheap thrills,1,15 May 2021,"Think about The Girl On the Train, but worse. The drunken Girl scraped a 6.5 rating, which is already way too much. The drunkard Woman is bound to fare not much better and deservedly so, because the plot is completely derivative without a shred of originality, like a Frankenstein monster composed with different parts of semi-decent thrillers, haphazardly stuck together.And no, quoting masterpieces film noir doesn't make this stand even remotely in the same category. In fact, it would be difficult to know in which category it stands, because it starts like a mild drama, it continues like a psychological thriller then it turns into a parody of a horror movie, ticking all the cliche boxes, from dark, creaking staircases to scared, screaming lady stalked by crazy killer in the rain.Adams as drunkard Dr. Anna Fox (such an ironic surname, nothing foxy about her) is barely OK. Admittedly, she didn't have much to work with because Dr. Fox is the worst ""child"" psychologist EVER, and with shrinks like that it's not surprising that half of the US is going crazy.",The Woman in the Window

34,jadepietro,A Lost Window of Opportunity,4,21 May 2021,"IN BRIEF: Murder most foul.JIM'S REVIEW: (NOT RECOMMENDED) The Woman in the Window could have and should have been better. Now, everyone who knows me knows that I love a good mystery... Line up the red herrings and start deducing the motives and mystery. But this movie is one plot contrivance after the next. All of the characters are slightly off, from the erratic tenant downstairs to the strange family next door. The story is all set-up leading to an unsatisfying conclusion filled with lots of LOL (Leaps of Logic), cheap thrills, and a sad feeling of déjà vu.You may have seen this story before: An incapacitated person may have witnessed a murder nearby and is unable to convince others of the dastardly deed. The inability to leave the home creates a dangerous scenario for our hero in Alfred Hitchcock suspense classic, Rear Window...oh, wait, I have the wrong movie...or do I? This movie wants to appear as an homage to that great 1954 mystery, but it is a shameless rip-off, re-envisioned for today's audience...only this time we have a female protagonist dealing with mental issues who is emotionally confined to her house and sees a murder across the street. Amy Adams takes over the Jimmy Stewart part, minus the plaster cast, wheelchair, and Grace Kelly. (And where's Thelma Ritter when you need her?)Ms. Adams plays Dr. Anna Fox, a child psychologist in need of one herself. She suffers from agoraphobia and alcoholism and she dare not venture outside. But fear not, persons will knock on her door for a pop-in visit to involve her in a shroud of mystery. It seems The Russells, a new family moving in across the street, don't know their limits and start their good neighbor policy rather quickly: Evan (Fred Hechinger) comes over to talk and share his story of possible abuse, temperamental father Alistair (Gary Oldman) bursts in sometimes, and his wife Jane (Julianne Moore) befriends Anna. Strange goings-on may not be what they seem to be. Or are they? ...Especially the murder of her newest friend. Was Jane's death real or imagined, a hallucination from Anna's daily wine and med regime or actually a grisly crime? The twists come rapidly to hold the moviegoer's interest, yet only one big reveal works midway through the film. Most of the time one wonders about her sanity or your own for watching this dumb predictable tale.This disappointing movie is directed by the usually reliable Joe Wright with huge chunks of flash and gimmicks that tend to imbalance the narrative. All of his theatrical excesses may add some style to the proceedings but cannot hide the woeful script by the talented Tracy Letts (who also plays Anna's psychiatrist). His screenplay adaptation is based on a best-selling novel by A. J. Finn, with some major rewrites and plot changes I am told. Except for Ms. Adams who makes the most of this showy role, the acting is overwrought, particularly the emoting of Mr. Hechinger, Wyatt Russell as the mercurial lodger, and an underused Jennifer Jason Leigh in a smaller role.The Woman in the Window remains baffling, even after the movie ends, Its transparency to build a suspenseful mystery is admirable. But the end result is opaque in its storytelling, cliché-ridden, and as clear as mud. Avoid. (GRADE: C-)",The Woman in the Window

That's a thriller cinema trope we need to do away with at this point. The Woman in the Window, directed by Joe Wright, visually aspires to be Hitchcock's Rear Window in its first half. That's not to say that it hits the same notes - nope! It tries. It tries hard. Given the kind of cast we see here (Amy Adams, Gary Oldman, Julianne Moore, Jennifer Jason Leigh) and an able director in Joe Wright (Atonement, Darkest Hour), The Woman in the Window feels underwhelming as hell. Tracy Letts' adapts AJ Finn's novel of the same name into a 100-minute film that boasts neither the necessary character texture nor the solid plot connections. Wright seems to be going for an all-out stylistic approach here, as he doesn't entirely have faith in the source material. I'd have liked a bit more ambiguity in thrillers like this (Hitchcock maintained that perfectly in Rear Window) as opposed to spoon-feeding.

44,bankofmarquis,It's NOT Rear Window,7,24 May 2021,"A piece of advice for you when you start to watch the ""Alfred Hitchcock-esque"" thriller, THE WOMAN IN THE WINDOW. If you are at all a Hitchcock fan, you will be spending the first part of this film comparing it to the 1954 classic REAR WINDOW and this would be a disservice to this film.For...THE WOMAN IN THE WINDOW is no Rear Window, nor is it intended to be. It has many, many elements that are the same as Rear Window (most notably, the setup: a housebound person thinks they have witnessed a murder in a neighboring apartment), and THE WOMAN IN THE WINDOW is just like Rear Window...until it isn't.And that's when I started to like this film, when I stopped comparing it (in my head) to Rear Window.Based on the Best Seller by A. J. Finn (adapted for the screen by Tracy Letts who also appears in the film), THE WOMAN IN THE WINDOW tells the tale of Anna Fox, an agoraphobic who watches life go on outside her window. When she thinks she has witnessed a murder, she (and the audience) must decide is it real? Did she truly witness a murder? If so, who dunnit? If not, is she just hallucinating things? Is Anna crazy?The answers to these questions were satisfying enough to me that I ended up enjoying the film experience that I had - but I have to be honest and tell you that, for awhile, my enjoyment of this film was hanging by a thread.Amy Adams (ENCHANTED) is terrific - if unspectacular - in the title role. Her Anna Fox is murkey (that is meant as a compliment) and struggles through most of the film trying to determine what is real and what is an illusion. Adams does a ""journeyman's"" job with this role. She acts her way through it in such a workmanlike fashion that I almost forgot that it is Adams on the screen.Wyatt Russell (Kurt's son who is also the new Captain America in THE FALCON AND THE WINTER SOLDIER) fares the best of the Supporting players for he has the most to do. Unfortunately, Director Joe Wright (ATONEMENT) and Screenwriter Letts wastes such strong actors as Gary Oldman (DARKEST HOUR), Julianne Moore (STILL ALICE), Anthony Mackie (The Falcon in the Marvel Movies), Jennifer Jason Leigh (HATEFUL 8), Brian Tyree Henry (GET OUT) and Letts himself in terribly underwritten roles that serve (mostly) as red herrings - and each of their characters are interchangeable and forgettable.And that, ultimately, is where this film comes apart. While I cared about Anna and the solution to the mystery - I didn't care very much about the other characters involved.Which is why, I think, I'll pull my DVD of Rear Window out and watch that film for the umpteenth time.Letter Grade: B7 Stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)",The Woman in the Window
45,Horror_Flick_Fanatic,A passable thriller,6,15 May 2021,"A passable thriller based on Hitchcock's Rear Window. But not identical to it, so I wouldn't consider it a remake. They made many changes from the original film. It does have a nod to Hitchcock's original within the first 5 minutes. It just doesn't have enough of the classic Hitchcock camera angles I would associate with Hitchcock. Hitchcock fans will understand what I mean by that.The film is both slow and too fast. The confrontations between Anna Fox and the Russells happen much too frequently without a long enough pause between them for Anna to have introspection. This is a streaming platform so I don't understand why there is a constraint on time like there is for theater movies? Directors please take your time and add more minutes to make a better movie if you are shooting for a streaming platform! This film really could have used better character development for the side characters too. Just felt too rushed.I felt the director could have spent more time with Anna psychological mindset. I just don't feel the film build enough tension before the climax begins. For a psychological thriller, you really have to spend time inside a person's head. Almost like turbo lag where it takes time to build up the air pressure in the cylinders to get the car flying down the road. We get that look into Anna's mindset only during the reveals of her back life with the detectives and the Russells in her home. I would have preferred a gradual and stead crescendoing of tension until I can't stand it anymore. But once the climax begins, the action increases quickly. But the psychological tension just wasn't there.The actors are all phenomenal, especially, Amy Adams. She is an amazing actress. Gary Oldman was a good choice for Mr. Russell. He really does a great villain. I found it hard to take when the beautiful Amy Adams gets you know what in the face. Ouch, really had a hard time with that scene. Yeah, I am a fan of Amy Adams as much as many of you are too and I cringed when I saw that scene.I summary, I think the film could have easily been an 8 or maybe a 9 out of 10 if the director focus a bit more on Anna. Also Brian Henry was a bit too soft cop. I would have liked him to have a tougher edge to him but still remain compassionate to Anna.",The Woman in the Window

The movie constantly tries to place the audience in the point of view of its main character's increasingly unstable mindset. This is occasionally effective, as you get a sense of her fragility and struggles, but too many times it's distracting because you just feel completely lost. The narrative also suffers from cramming too much into too little amount of time.

48,AhmedSpielberg99,Such a let down!,5,15 May 2021,"Besides the fact it's directed by Joe Wright who's behind the 2005's brilliant adaptation of Jane Austen's masterwork, Pride and Prejudice, and that it stars Amy Adams in the leading role (because she's Amy Adams!), The Woman in the Window has been one of my most anticipated films of the year since knowing that its lead character suffers from agoraphobia, a subject that piqued my interest for the last couple of years. Amy Adams plays the eponymous heroine, Anna. An alcoholic agoraphobic child psychiatrist who when she's not drinking wine and watching movies she quotes word-for-word, she occupies herself by spying on her neighbours, observing their activities as some sort of a abreaction to her incapacitating phobia. This voyeuristic behaviour seems to be endorsed by her own psychiatrist. In his words, ""curiosity is the evidence of a decreased depression pattern,"" a clue that her agoraphobia was resulted from depression. Anna's anxiety disorder doesn't merely confine her to her home, for it also keeps her in a constant fear of finding herself in stressful situations, the thing that makes her very easily startled. She perceives every noise or object coming from outside her house as a source of menace. Her eyes being shown in close-ups from the opening shot and throughout the movie (with one shot including her eye alongside Salvador Dalí's eye curtain from Hitchcock's Spellbound) could be interpreted as a symbol that fittingly ties up with the film's theme of voyeurism. But aside from that, Anna's eyes being always depicted wide-open makes them susceptible to assault from what she fears, which indicates that her constant state of apprehension is her own culprit. And Amy Adams conveys Anna's tumultuous emotions and lack of instability impeccably. Additionally, Bruno Delbonnel's noir-ish visual touches along with an exemplary sound design found their way across the film to express Anna's state of mind audiovisually. Her house is drenched in yellow to represent Anna's paranoia. Sharp, abrupt cuts reflect her nervous and fidgety conduct. Shots of a vertiginous staircase lend a sense of dizziness. The sound of doorknobs as they are twisted to open the door is enough to make Anna's heart skipping a beat and even fainting.Ok, what comes of all that build-up? Or rather, how will all these pieces be combined and brought together into a cohesive whole? Easy. Just take all of these elements, amp them up to 11, put them in a blender and splatter them out! Dutch angles, asymmetrical compositions, extreme close-ups, low and high-contrast lighting (chiaroscuro), and more noir visual elements are copiously and gratuitously thrown on the screen in quick succession. The result is, they all just wind up being confusing and don't add up anything to what've been established earlier. What about the mystery? The movie keeps teetering between portraying Anna as a lunatic (nothing good comes off that save for a shot or two that harken back to the 19-century Gothic literature and the Madwoman trope) and depicting her as a victim to gaslighting (which was subtly foreshadowed earlier, as one of the films Ethan borrowed from Anna was George Cukor's Gaslight). None of these routes, however, are given enough delineation to be taken or rather to be torn between. But anyway, the movie quickly abandons the conundrum it was going for in favour of an easy, hackneyed device in a futile attempt to justify that jumbled mess of a second act, which builds towards an early, unearned reveal. But be that as it may, I didn't mind an anti-climactic ending as long as the window's curtain is finally going to be drawn. Much to my dismay, there was still a third act, and boy was it horrendous! The movie that's riddled with references to other noir films - including to Rear Window, of course, to the point I doubted if The Woman in the Window is actually a riff on it - has suddenly become a cheesy b-horror movie. Groovy! The fact that one side character shows up after another without being introduced beforehand didn't bother me. For with each of them, I saw many potential threads. All of which, unfortunately, never successfully weaves anything of interest with Anna. They all end up being mere plot devices without giving them even a fraction of the consideration they were supposedly afforded, and the incredible cast of A-listers can't really save them despite having a couple of moments where they truly shine, mainly Gary Oldman and Julianne Moore. Such a let down!",The Woman in the Window
49,Movi3DO,Rushed storyline,5,15 May 2021,"Antisocial and creepy Amy Adams.When I saw the trailer for this movie last year, I got hyped and read the book. The book was pretty good and got some tension.However, I couldn't say the same for the movie. In the book, a good chunk of time was spent on developing the main character: her boring life in the house, and how her obsession made her say more interesting. In the movie tho, there were so little time developing her character, so it's hard to feel how the agoraphobia really affected her life.Also, the movie moved very fast, and perhaps too fast. Many plot points were glanced through. It's the same for the Russell family and the character David in this movie. You don't see enough of their interaction, as well as the main character's fascination in them.This rush storytelling also didn't help the twist. I already knew the twist from the book, but still found the it too sudden and unwarranted in the movie.The editing was decent with different styles, but many were questionable. The ending's editing was especially terrible.Overall, some good editing choices, but the rushed storyline ruined any thrill from this movie. 5/10.",The Woman in the Window
50,tm-sheehan,A Fruity Melodrama seen through the Rear Window,6,16 May 2021,"My Review - The Woman in the Window. NetflixMy Rating 6/10What a waste of great talent in my opinion this is a perfect example of a movie running off the rails due to too many subplots and a poor screenplay that I suspect doesn't do the novel justice, perhaps a better series rather than a movie to expand on the complex characters perhaps not on second thought.The plot briefly is interesting as was the trailer about an agoraphobic woman living alone in New York who begins spying on her new neighbors, only to witness a disturbing act of violence.Sound familiar? Remember James Stewart as L. B. Jefferies ""Jeff"" in Alfred Hitchcock 's classic 1954 thriller ""Rear Window""? The plot of ""Rear Window"" was as so similar to ""The Woman at the Window."" A wheelchair-bound photographer James Stewart spies on his neighbors from his apartment window and becomes convinced one of them has committed murder. The difference is Hitchcock 's characters are totally believable and he didn't get the title of ""Master of Suspense "" for nothing .The character development and suspense is missing in this movie at times it's more a hysterical melodrama . I call it a donut movie the plot goes in circles with a big hole in the middle.The similarities to both movies cannot be ignored they are too obvious and I think that's part of the problem. The saying "" comparisons are odious "" rings true in ""The Woman in the Window"" because unexplained parts of the plot really stink .Fortunately the performances by a superb cast headed by Amy Adams as Anna Fox a woman suffering from trauma and trying to cope by taking her medication with alcohol instead of water makes anything that she ""imagines ""she has seen as unreliable . When she reports these incidents to the Police of course they're questionable to put it mildly. Julianne Moore has a vital but very brief role as does Gary Oldman as Alistair Russell who has moved into the neighbourhood with his family opposite Anna Fox.No spoilers but the Russell family are most unpleasant and creepy and would fit comfortably into a Stephen King novel ,especially their son Ethan who is befriended early in the movie by our very dysfunctional heroine Anna.I gave this film a second look as I dozed off on first viewing waking up to the climactic final scenes but on second viewing the pieces of the jig saw plot just wouldn't fit .It's worth a look in my view for the performances it obviously went straight to streaming instead of a Cinema release which I thought odd.",The Woman in the Window
51,msbreviews,It's no surprise that this adaptation of A. J. Finn's novel is a strong contender for the following year's Razzies...,2,20 May 2021,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)How many times have you heard something along the lines of ""oh, this film has phenomenal actors, surely it must be great""? Obviously, countless examples defend or contradict this last statement, but unfortunately, the average moviegoer often gives more credit to the cast than to the director(s) and/or writer(s). This means that when a movie is truly amazing, actors receive the best compliments even if they didn't contribute as much as the other two filmmaking roles. However, when a film turns out to be a massive disappointment, the cast rarely gets the worst commentaries.The Woman in the Window is the perfect example of a movie that should have never created high expectations. Contrary to what people might think, this Joe Wright's film went through non-stop delays, even before the pandemic began. Netflix wasn't even the original distributor, but the general audience doesn't care about production issues. If the cast boasts some well-known, fan-favorite actors, most viewers will highly anticipate that movie without ever thinking about who's directing or writing it. It's no surprise that this adaptation of A. J. Finn's novel is a strong contender for the following year's Razzies...From the confusing editing work (Valerio Bonelli) - probably due to the constant re-edits - to the tremendously forced dialogues, Tracy Letts' screenplay is packed with problems concerning basically every single character interaction. The overall narrative is an utter mess that never finds its footing, ending in a convoluted, nonsensical, incredibly fake-looking film. Everything feels overdramatic, extremely fictional, and emotionless. Amy Adams, Gary Oldman, Julianne Moore, and all the other popular actors struggle so much with their scripts that some of them genuinely deliver an awful caricature of themselves.Honestly, the only reason this doesn't get my lowest grade is due to a couple of actors that actually try to make the story a little less unbearable.Rating: D-",The Woman in the Window

I was massively surprised when I was this had such a low rating. The twist with that mum actually being the mum was crazy to me and proper didn't expect it. When it hit the point where everything tied together it was so good and satisfying. It had a happy ending and the acting from Amy adams was incredible, well done to her. The rating is completely wrong for me. Also why does Anthony Mackie always do these weird little roles in films. He was hardly in this film, weird from him. This also proper reminded me of the film, girl on a train. A film I really liked so that explains why I liked it so much.",The Woman in the Window
53,Alexander_Blanchett,Poor Adaptation,6,15 May 2021,"Disappointing adaption. It had some good moments thats for sure but having read the novel before it is not deniable how much potential was unused. The whole film felt incredibly chopped down. It did not take any time to develop the characters in a proper way and thus the audience easily feels unconnceted. Most prominentally the relationship between Ethan and Anna is almost not existable and this was much more detailed in the novel. Thats why the ending probably made not much sense or did not have the emotional impact the novel had. Thats why the film fell incredibly flat. Also Gary Oldman's character is just there for its purpose but then he disappears and never comes back. Too bad.Amy Adams was good. Not bad performance at all. I think she understood her character very well and in a ""fuller"" version of this film this would prbably be more embraced. Gary Oldman as mentioned is just there. The character in the book is much more detailed and its an ideal character that plays tricks on peoples expecations. In the film he feels more like an extra. Not a tool to build tense. Also Jennifer Jason Leigh has like 2 lines in the entire film. You wonder why an actress of her caliber would accept such a second rate role. Then you realize just how much must have been left on the editing floor. Same goes to Anthony Mackie who 99% of his performance is just a voice over.Julianne Moore is also incredibly wasted, but that was ok as the role itself is not much bigger in the book. She did ok for the material given to her. Last and very least we have Fred Hechinger who was absolutely awful and unbelievable. Maybe his bad performance was the reason the films relationship between Anna and Ethan was cut down to the limit. Also Wyatt Russell was weak. I felt he totally misinterpreted the character.The editing was also absoluteyl awful. MAny quick cuts. No tension builder at all.The good aspects were besides Amy Adams believable performance the score, a decent cinematography and a generally nice look. The story itself is good and captivating - just not so much on screen.",The Woman in the Window

58,ronakkotian,This is what production issues and delays leads to...,3,22 May 2021,"I was very excited for this film when it was announced. The amazing cast and story had me waiting in anticipation. After it finally released one week ago, I have to say this is a mess.The Woman in the Window is about Anna Fox, an agoraphobic woman, who spies on a couple living opposite her and believes she witnesses a horrific act of violence.I anticipated this film for a long time but the constant production issues and delays made me worried and it's clear those issues affected the final film really badly. There is clearly a lot of inspiration from Alfred Hitchcock films especially Rear Window, where some shots even mirror that film, but it comes together in a very rushed manner. There are some neat visuals here and there and elements that kept my curiosity piqued but the pay off was very disappointing. For some reason the third act goes by really quick, giving us crucial details and reveals in an instant. The major reveal at the end was incredibly unsatisfying due to the lack of tension, poor character development and set up. Amy Adams' character is developed a bit but there wasn't much to grapple onto for me to care about. The rest of the characters are incredibly as the film doesn't bother attempting to flesh them out in any way.The performances are okay for the most part. The real saviour of this film is Amy Adams who delivers a terrific performance. She really tries but it's sad that the material she had to work with is really bad. Gary Oldman and Fred Hechinger weren't that great. Brian Tyree Henry, Anthony Mackie and Jennifer Jason Leigh barely had screen time and were completely wasted here. Julianne Moore is great for the short time she's onscreen but also feels wasted.I can't think of many positives for The Woman in the Woman. There is a good story in here somewhere but it just seems like wasted potential now. Amy Adams is great and carries the film but I don't see any reason to watch it again. It's a very bland thriller that manages to achieve nothing.",The Woman in the Window

62,sweidman-28016,Disappointing,5,24 May 2021,"""The point of me doing this is that there's no confusion of my soundness of mind. My state of mind.""Based on a good book, The Woman in the Window is about an agoraphobic woman living alone in New York who begins spying on her new neighbors, only to witness a disturbing act of violence. I bought the book at the beginning of quarantine last year and intended to read it, but forgot about it a few chapters in. Just last month while in my dorm, I figured some reading time would do me good even though I really don't like it read. Interestingly enough, I finished that book in just one day (technically two but I'm counting the hours instead) and really enjoyed it. As filming for the movie came to a conclusion and they had test screenings close to two year ago now, the reactions came in mixed-negative with complaints about story and it being confusing. It got delayed from a promising November release to March 2020. We know where it goes from here and eventually Netflix picked it up and here we are over a year later. If you couldn't tell by now, this is a mess of a movie. And it's not just me comparing book to movie. Hardly anyone is liking it. The script is the first issue. Tracey Letts is a better actor than writer. It feels forced and too on the nose for what the movie is. As for the story, it gets worse. The beginning is fine in setup. Honestly I don't have much complaints about that. But after the first big event, everything is rushed and incoherent that it is hard to follow. The story is supposed to be a mystery and sort of mind-bending in a sense, but it take it too far here. Things don't add up. Stuff is left out from the book that feel all too important. One big part of the book is left out that affects the third act where nothing makes sense about it. I could go into more detail, but the point is a different screenwriter was needed.Joe Wright is a fantastic director when he doesn't mess it up. He is a hit or miss, but with films like Pride & Prejudice and Atonement, it's hard not to get excited. In some cases, the directing works. There's a clear comparison between old noir films and this story. Rear Window is a honestly a similar story and worth watching over this. Most of this is seen through the cinematography. The quality of it is beautiful and the production design is worth mentioning. Sometimes it's almost laughable like it's making a parody of a Hitchcock film. And I can relate that back to the script. The vision is there but the execution wasn't. If there's anything that should be worth mentioning, it's Amy Adams. But would you expect anything but a decent performance from her? She's great and always will be. The casting is pretty good as well. I do have issue with Fred Hechinger as Ethan. Ethan is supposed to be just barely 16 but Fred is in his early 20s so it's obvious. Also, his acting just didn't fit the role. I want to complain more, but that would be a waste. If anything, The Woman in the Window is entertaining enough. I wouldn't say enjoyable or decent in any sense, but just watchable. Or maybe not. Both critics and audiences don't like it and it's being quickly forgotten with the recommendation to watch almost anything else. You decide for yourself.",The Woman in the Window

66,Just-A-Girl-14,Disappointing!,6,15 May 2021,"I was really looking forward to watching this movie. I was counting the days until it was finally released on Netflix. I was expecting a really good thriller, something resembling Disturbia or even better but boy, what a huge letdown it was!It wasn't thrilling. It was slow, heavy and sometimes plain boring. Worst of all so much of it didn't make sense. Here are some of the things that bothered me most: first, who lets strangers just in and out of their house like that? Neighbors that just moved in, tenants that you know nothing about. One would expect an educated woman who lives alone to be more careful than that. Second, she called 911 right after the murder. He killed his mother with a knife to the guts, there was blood all over the place. Are we really expected to believe they managed to remove all the blood and evidence before the cops arrived? The cops would ask to look around. They wouldn't ignore a call like this. They had no way of knowing the neighbor might be crazy so it makes no sense. Also, if she fainted on the street (or was hit by a car, I'm not sure what it was), why did she wake up in her house with the cops and neighbors all around her? Who would let them in? Why didn't they call an ambulance? I think the scene was meant to be dramatic but I found it bizarre and stupid. Third, if she was alone and delusional her shrink would make sure she gets a proper medical care. A delusional person can be dangerous to himself and others. Forth, the scene in which we learn the truth was not convincing. So this kid it basically a serial killer in the making. If he's that smart he would know there's no way he could get away with so much. I also think the way she killed him was unrealistic. It wasn't clear what really happened there. One moment he was drowning her in the rain and then something changed his mind? Also, in reality, it's way more likely she'd fall with him. Lastly, mental illness is a serious thing. I found it very unbelievable that 9 months after a traumatic event like this she'd be magically all cured. Maybe it's possible but when you add all of these things together it's just doesn't make sense. From what I read, it makes more sense in the book because there's a lot more information but in the movie it just the didn't. The pace was off and it was just one big messy weird movie. Watchable?

Despite putting her best foot forward as an agoraphobic, alcoholic child psychiatrist, 'Woman in the Window' unfortunately suffers from taking itself too seriously as a suspense thriller.At the outset, 'Window' has a few things going for it - a basic setting that somehow feels much more grand than it is in reality, an all-star supporting cast (Gary Oldman, Julianne Moore, Anthony Mackie) and an intriguing protagonist who is as charismatic as she is flawed. The film pretty much rides entirely on Adams, but her typically strong acting is not enough to sustain a somewhat run-of-the-mill plot that leaves a whole lot of loose ends in its wake. Even a fourth quarter ""twist"" isn't enough to save 'Window' from mediocrity.Still, 'Woman in the Window' is head and shoulders above some of the other recent entries in the ""Netflix original"" bucket, so if you're starved for new content, it's not too much time wasted.",The Woman in the Window

That's where the similarities mostly end...and, if you think the conclusion in this is reminiscent of Lars Thorwald's (Raymond Burr) confrontation...well, I'd love to hear that argument. Either way, it's either derivative or unoriginal. Both can be true.The house-bound shut-in rents part of her building to a Red-Herring named David (Wyatt Russell), who is constantly angry, vaguely menacing and serves absolutely zero purpose in the story.

I see a big future for him.For the rest, it's another ""forgot to take your meds"" character. It's groan-worthy...so many films rely on this device...you have to make them slightly nuts so the plot can move on. Here, we need her goofy because the plot requires that nobody believe her claim that she witnessed a murder.The ending couldn't have been any more predictable...a rooftop battle in the rain.I like Gary Oldman and I think they tricked him into appearing in this.

1. Amy Adams (Anna Fox) and Gary Oldman (Alistair Russell) do their best with the script given to them; they're the only things that make this film watchable.2. The cuts during the action scenes help to pump vitality into those scenes making them slightly more tense and energetic.Cons:
1. The dialogue is really stale and mechanical, which makes the character interactions feel awkward and unnatural: ""I like cat's tongues.""2. Apparently Joe Wright (Director) decided that he wanted the score to blare out throughout the movie. It never shuts up and is always in your face.3. The reveal of the deaths of Ed (Anthony Mackie) and Olivia (Mariah Bozeman) fails not only because it's extremely obvious from the get-go, but it's eventual reveal is so ham-fisted that you can't help but roll your eyes.4. Most of the characters are really one-dimensional, boring and thus uninteresting and unlikable.5. The CGI violence and gore look awfully bad, particularly that featured in the last act.6. This movie feels like a blending of Rear Window (1954) and The Machinist (2004), however (amidst other things) it lacks the charm and intrigue of the former, and the intelligence, depth and subtlety of the latter.7. The final reveal of Ethan Russell (Fred Hechinger) as the killer comes across as unintentionally comedic and cheap. There's no slight set-up to it, it was clearly just done to subvert expectations.8.

It hurts me to say this because this was one film I was so excited about for so long but it did not live up to my expectations. Amy Adams is so much better than this. This was a lazy script derived from movies such as Rear Window, Disturbia, The Girl on the Train and elements of Fright Night. It's not ready anything new or unique. I haven't read the book so I can't comment if the script differs from the book or if they've followed it, but I certainly hope the book is better than this underwhelming mess. It makes me sad when I think about the amazing psychological thrillers there are out there and out of all of them, they chose this one to adapt. It was lacklustre and very flat. It was so boring I actually struggled to get through it. And they have some big names in these pathetic little roles. Really didn't like it. Waste of a lot of talent there.",The Woman in the Window

Sure, the film has it's faults, but don't act like that's all it is. The overall tone is a little heavy handed, but that comes with the territory for this style of thriller. While it's easy to predict many of the oncoming twists from the get go, the exact details of which are unknown until they slowly reveal themselves. The Hitchcock homage is fully baked into it's fabric, so it's a tribute more than a copycat. For anyone who says ""why not just watch Rear Window"", um, maybe cause movies made nearly 70 years apart from each other have a slightly different vibe? Plus, the format of Rear Window has been explored so many times by pop culture over the years, it's like saying ""why not just watch Night of the Living Dead"" to every new zombie movie. The modern retelling allows for some intriguing visual effects that illustrate the decent to madness, and the A-list cast does what A-listers do and turn in impressive performances. The climax and resolution are pretty stereotypical, but that doesn't completely discount the build up towards them. It's an effective genre film, and a love letter to one of the greatest directors of all time. While it may stumble occasionally, it never falls face first.",The Woman in the Window

93,BillBayard,A mixed bag,5,16 May 2021,"Well, it certainly isn't remotely as good as the book, but most adaptions aren't as they can't live up to the vision you have created in your own mind when reading the source if you enjoyed it. In this case, it's also just sort of a condensed idea of the book and it needs more detail. Having said that, it isn't terrible as some have said. It will hold your attention as even in this slimmed down version, it's a bit complicated which causes some interest. A story of an agoraphobic woman and what she witnesses through her windows is inevitably compared to Rear Window, which doesn't help. The movie anchors on Adams and she does well enough as does Oldham & Moore, but the latter two along with Leigh and Mackie beg the question what are they doing in such small & limited roles, though in one case that does make some sense. This had some problems with test audiences and my guess is that some of their performances ended up on the cutting room floor. Fred Hechinger, who does not look like 15 years old, gives a rather pedestrian & unconvincing performance in a key role. The film looks good and the film clips are an interesting touch.

Joe Wright, the director of this mess, had high quality ingredients in Amy Adams, Gary Oldman, Julianne Moore and a few other formidable pieces. He had the recipe of an intriguing thriller inspired by Hitchcock's masterpiece The Rear Window. And yet somehow, he managed to create a film that resembles a 90s C-Rated horror sequel.I was well prepared for this meal after it has been delayed in 2020 but the instant I sat at the table and heard a character say that ""I don't discuss my cat allergies in front of cats because I don't want them to feel offended"", I wanted to stick some butter in my ears. The rest of the film was just as bad whether you look at the story, editing or the overall atmosphere. The tragic part is that the film thinks that it is some sort of an homage-reincarnation of Hitchcock while in reality, it is a distorted mess that lacks any vision or direction.I genuinely felt bad for the actors who had to participate in this disaster of a movie. Even if you are a huge Amy Adams fan like myself, I would still recommend avoiding this movie like a plague. When the director was making The Woman in the Window I don't think he knew what genre or style he wanted to go with so he ended up with a big nothing that insults the minds of the audience much like a dish which upsets the stomach.Movies.shmovies on Instagram for movie and TV Shows.",The Woman in the Window

The movie twists and turns and when you think you get the plot line, it twists again. There were a few plot holes but there a so few great films anymore that I expect mediocre production values these days.

The director Joe Wright has a decent track record, and was behind the astonishing Black Mirror episode ""Nosedive"", so should have been able to pull this off. Even the music by the legendary Danny Elfman is jarring, overblown, and distracting.It's like everybody involved, actors, writers, editors, got together and agreed to knock this together as fast as possible, cash their Netchecks, and never speak of it again.Plot-wise, it's Rear Window with some utterly unnecessary embellishments that detract from the original. Apparently it's based on a book. Well, if you go by this production of it, the book is just ripping off Hitchcock: either that's unfair, or they fouled it up. Either way, it's an appallingly trite and clumsy screenplay.I'm struggling to find anything positive to say, I'm just stunned by how bad the sum of the parts is.

I was really excited to see this because I love the actors and the film looked very interesting. I was only right about the actors. I think Amy Adams did a good job in her role as she usually does but not great. Gary Oldman was very over the top at points but did good and Anthony Mackie was underutilized. Everyone else was fine. Gary Oldman'a kid in the movie was incredibly annoying and I didn't really like Julianne Moore's performance. The script is pretty awful at points. A lot of this dialogue is incredibly forced and awkward and doesn't leave a lot to be interpreted. This film prides itself on trying to make you think but the reveal makes all of that incredibly pointless. The first two acts of the film are pretty dull. It's a confusing, disjointed mess. The third act is abysmal though. The reveals were awful and the circumstances were terrible and obnoxious. It ruined any semblance of ambiguity the film had which really sucked. I did like some of the shots though. They felt cool and unique along with some of the framing and lighting but it's fruitless in the overall scope of the story. The music was good but felt poorly used. Some scenes had music that probably shouldn't and some scenes had music that felt like it belonged at other points in the movie.

Even The Simpsons did their own version of it.But yeah, this starts off really fizzy, but goes uber-flat, very quickly! I started to lose interest around the 50 minute mark...and by the end of it, I just didn't care about anyone OR anything in the film.

She the witnesses a murder and the movie moves on from there. I love the extreme 'Amy/Anna' close-ups of her face in the foreground. I would suspect that the mixture of substances and isolation makes Anna's perspective unreliable from the start, which means the title cards indicating days of the week are useful only to the audience. Then again, who among us hasn't felt like time is a flat circle over the past year or so? I would watch this movie again. There is a part in the film Dr. Fox remembers a car accident and since part of the movie is in apartment, so is the car. Interesting scene.",The Woman in the Window

The exposition sets up the audience for a reversal that is quite effective, But then . .it completely falls apart in the last 30 minutes.

139,filmtravel101,Solid acting and nice directing - good twists a la Hitchcock,6,17 May 2021,This was a pleasant surprise of a movie that is good entertainment if you like thrillers similar to hitchcock type of films. The script is solid and moves at a nice tempo and Amy Adams as always is superb and surely will get a nomination for this little gem. The twists at the end i did not see them coming and the only minor complaint is the ending yet I did not read the novel it is based upon so perhaps more is explained yet it seems like a nice positive bow tie ending that Hollywood loves to toss in there. And this is one of the few times the PC world of Hollywood tosses in some great black actors in appropriate roles that actually work in a city like NYC. Maybe one day they will toss in more Asians and Hispanics roles but doubt that will happen unless someone starts to complain while giving speeches at the Oscars. ;)A solid 6 film ( i did not rate it any higher because it is not very original and feels like a low budget remake of more powerful films from the master HItchcock.,The Woman in the Window

141,arod_85,Not as bad as the ratings suggest...,6,16 May 2021,"I initially was very excited for this movie. I love to read and watch murder mysteries. I had not read this book, but I was extra excited for this one because of the stellar casting of Amy Adams, Gary Olman, Anthony Mackie, and Julianne Moore. After its release, I noticed a pretty low rating on IMDb and already set myself up to expect to be disappointed. After watching, it wasn't as bad as I had expected it to be post review surfing but not as good as I thought it would be when the movie was first advertised. It was fairly obvious to me what was going on pretty early on in the movie after she first met ""Jane Russell 1 (Katie)"". I knew who the victim was and the killer was, but did figure the son did it because the father was having an affair with Katie. Any who, it's pretty predictable, but worth a watch when nothing else is on. The movie did manage to feel rushed and drug out at the same time if that makes sense. I think they should have used a few more scenes to build the relationship between Ethan with Ana and Katie with Ana. This would have made the reveal of Jane's identity and Ethan's identity have more impact. The way the movie rushed through the relationships made Ana come across crazy by making judgments while barely knowing these individuals which kind of gave away the ""twist"". The movie spent too long on shots of Ana in a dirty house and falling asleep. Also, the movie isn't as clever and it thinks it is. I get for the sake of the title, she had to have an apartment in the building across the way to view into their home. However, would a killer really be that stupid to leave the blinds open as he commits murder? Especially premeditated murder committed by a serial killer. And if the scream was loud enough for Ana to hear across the street, are you seriously going to convince the viewers that no other neighbors, especially those above or below the Russell's apartment couldn't hear and helped to confirm Ana's story?",The Woman in the Window

Despite the usual genre flaws, I wasn't bored, but I wasn't thrilled either. And as is common lately, high-profile names (Julianne Moore, Gary Oldman) are used to show up in mini-roles. I would have liked to see more of Moore, because she plays everyone to the wall, although I like Amy Adams in the role of a woman suffering from agoraphobia, who has to outgrow herself, but this comes far too short, like so many aspects in this film.

150,Stream2BigScreen_Movie_Reviews,It Should Be Curtains for The Woman in the Window,6,31 May 2021,"The Woman in the Window was supposed to premiere in theaters last year. Like many other movies, it was shuffled around due to COVID and eventually was sold to Netflix. It premiered on the streaming service a couple weeks ago to little promotion and fanfare. I read the book that the film was based on a few years ago, but I remember that novel being a real page-turner, as paperback thrillers go. Let's see how this adaptation turned out.Here, Amy Adams plays Dr. Anna Fox, a child psychologist who suffers from debilitating agoraphobia. While Dr. Fox has been secluded in her large brownstone in New York City, she has become engrossed in monitoring her neighbors including the Russell family, the new neighbors who have moved into the property across the street. Filled with mind-altering medications and consumed by alcohol, coping with the separation from her husband (Anthony Mackie) and her young daughter, Dr. Fox begins to question her own sanity when she sees something through the window that she can't explain. The Woman in the Window devolves into a fairly obvious whodunnit and uses Dr. Fox's psychological fragility as a scapegoat.The Woman in the Window is a paint-by-numbers attempt to imitate Alfred Hitchcock's Rear Window. This movie fits pretty easily into a genre of films where unreliable women attempt to solve a crime they're not sure really exists. In fact, there is a bit of a Lifetime quality to it. However, Joe Wright can be a stylish director; and for the benefit of the audience, The Woman in the Window becomes an exercise in style over substance. Every scene looks great from the design of Dr. Fox's brownstone to the color and photography throughout. There is one completely engrossing sequence mid-film that seems to be the reason the entire film exists. Despite all that, the film does devolve into rote thriller territory because the mystery has to be solved, right? - unfortunately, the filmmakers were unable to find an interesting way to solve it.Although the plot can be kind of silly, as the centerpiece of the action, Amy Adams gives a passionate and heartfelt performance. Adams taps into the confusion, terror and heartbreak of Dr. Fox. She's a sympathetic character when she's not being stupid. In fact, Adam's performance deserves a better movie. The rest of the cast does serviceable work though. Julianne Moore bring infectious energy to a small role. Gary Oldman comes through in a couple scenes to yell and be sinister. Bryan Tyree Henry brings grounded empathy to an otherwise non-descript detective role. No one really is bad, except the kid who plays Ethan Russell. I didn't get what he was doing and that could have derailed the whole thing.The Woman in the Window is a thriller that tries its best to rise above the mediocre material. The director made good choices to add some flourish to the film and the lead performance by Amy Adams is better than the movie deserves. Ultimately, it is an entertaining watch, even though it is not an otherwise special movie. This film is a rainy Sunday afternoon watch with a handful of popcorn.",The Woman in the Window

154,movieliker1,Amy Adams is terrific.,7,18 May 2021,"As usual, Amy Adams' acting is great. This movie is well done. But there are plot holes.I find it hard to believe people would live in a big city and never close their curtains or blinds day or night. Especially a family with so much to hide as the family across the street.(And by the way, when the Jennifer Jason Leigh character calls the Amy Adams character and says, ""Quit watching my family or I'm gonna call the police."" She can call all she wants. All the police are going to do is tell her, ""Close your curtains if you don't like it. That lady has the right to look out her windows. Looking out one's windows is not against the law."")All her bumbling (Anna Fox played by Adams) before her big breakdown can be attributed to her drug and alcohol abuse. But after that, she's just a clutz.And I find it hard to believe anybody watching a neighboring family through a camera wouldn't just snap the button and take pictures when the incriminating action is occurring.And why would she flip out when threatened by the friendly neighborhood serial killer? She was going to kill herself anyway. I know from experience, those are the most dangerous people to threaten with violence, because they just don't care.Amy Adams is terrific. There are lots of big name actors in it. It's done well. But like most movies, you need to just ignore the plot holes. And enjoy what's good about it.",The Woman in the Window
155,pronitmallick,A good watch for the weekend,6,17 May 2021,"The Woman in the Window is a movie that puts you in the middle of a mild thrill after you start watching it. As the movie progresses things start to come up in your mind and you start to compare this movie with something you have watched before, cause not story-wise but pattern wise this movie has a lot of predecessors. The actors of this movie, from Amy Adams to Gary Oldman to Julianne Moore all of them put their best efforts from their side. The direction seems good and so does the screenplay but some more polish could have been done cause at some point you can literally figure out what's gonna happen next. In terms of thrill and suspense, the film doesn't deliver that much of a big product, it was more like a mild one but still, it was enjoyable. Through the first and second the audience will definitely encounter scenes which they wanna skip cause it does seem lengthy and predictable.

157,bluefim,Mystery to theatrical drama to ???,4,21 August 2021,"I am not familiar with the novel but I thought the trailer looked compelling enough for a casual viewing, and I certainly did not predict... all of that.The film begins as a slow-burning but interesting enough crime triller before becoming a melodramatic stage performance (protagonist monologue included), lastly going a high-octane slasher route that provided no satisfying conclusion. I think a lot of drawn out scenes emphasizing the drinking, over-medication, and depression plus ""it's all in your mind"" cliches could have been cut out for more background on characters/events to fleshe things out better before the conclusion. Scenes are implausible like bringing a suspect into an accuser's house (seriously people love coming in groups to this lady's house without permission), overly hamfisted suspicious interactions that are supposed to incriminate a character, and police detectives playing medical professional.The music was grating in some parts but that might have been the result of a mash of genres to go along with the executive of the movie itself.

The sets are gorgeous - empty, dark and decrepit old house representing the main character's state of mind, the boxy, stage-like views through the windows across the street, well thought out, well composed, beautiful color.There are a few 'ugh' moments but they do not take away from making this a highly watchable and enjoyable movie.",The Woman in the Window

However the overacting is so dialed up that it's comical at moments.And that's modus operandi of the whole movie.Story is a mix-ripoff of Rear Window from Hitchcock and Copycat with Sigourney Weaver. It's not the worst movie I saw lately but direction is kinda janky, music is whatever and photography, while it does look inspired at moments is in end pretty much predictable and unimpressive.However, there is one huge redeeming quality about this movie, which I found about right after watching it. Movie is based on a book, if you can believe someone wrote a book that's ripoff of a famous movie, mixed with random movie from the 90's. And after that comes the redeeming quality part - then I was introduced to an article about the book's author, in New Yorker, named ""A Suspense Novelist's Trail of Deceptions"".And hoooo boy, it's a ride.

Because what all these ingredients would assume is some intelligence by the viewer. But all that is gone today; in music, art, movies. I actually kept watching for a good bit but had to turn the sound off. That soundtrack was the most idiotic, over produced, heavy handed track I have ever heard. Literally within the first 7 minutes we already have the score at deafening levels, invoking a big finale face-off. This happens again and again; to where it loses any weight or emphasis, and becomes only an annoyance. She is opening the door! The faucet drips! And the orchestra hits. The plot is full of holes.

174,severindringel,"Promising premise, horrible outcome",4,18 May 2021,"Joe Wright, an established director who paved the way for one of the best actors of our time to win his first Oscar with Darkest Hour. This actor is part of an ensemble cast exclusively with world-class names. Moreover, the film is based on an acclaimed best-selling thriller. The omens for The Woman in the Window could not have been better. In the end, we get a cheap Alfred Hitchcock copy made without any originality, passion or skill.Amy Adams, Gary Oldman, Julianne Moore and Jennifer Jason Leigh - these four names alone boast a total of fifteen Oscar nominations. But even they are a shadow of their former selves in this disappointing film. Amy Adams plays the lead role of Dr. Anna Fox, a child psychologist suffering from agoraphobia. In other words, she can't leave her house and spends her daily life with medications, alcohol and old classic films. This film is miles away from the latter anyway, but not even Adams can convince for long stretches. She shows all her class in quiet moments and dialogues, which is especially evident in a scene with Julianne Moore's character. In the ""exciting"" and troubled moments, Adams embodies this mentally ill woman far too exaggeratedly and with very little credibility. This further flop is a shame in that Adams did not cover herself with glory in a similar role in her last film to date, Hillbilly Elegy. The aforementioned Moore has only this one brief scene in which she emerges as the film's only bright spot. She is funny, relatable and above all one thing: interesting. That would have done the film good, but unfortunately the director didn't know what to do with her character. Therefore, the focus is more on supporting characters like Oldman's Alistair Russell. A big mistake, because this character is virtually non-existent. And if he is, Oldman overplays him completely. The same goes for Wyatt Russell as Ana's aide David or Fred Hechinger in the role of Ethan, Alistair's son. Jennifer Jason Leigh has only one line anyway and otherwise stands around uselessly. A cast that reads well but goes completely under here.Wright could not have chosen a more generic approach to this film. Not even the mystery of the plot can convince, although it is not uninteresting in its premise. Instead of concentrating on a coherent build-up, the film prefers to rely on flashbacks and special effects without any impact. Admittedly, however, these are done quite well. Visually, The Woman in the Window doesn't lack much either. But that doesn't help if there is so little else that fits together. Exaggeratedly eccentric performances, thriller and horror elements from kindergarten and an incredibly predictable and emotionless ending make this below-average bestseller film a disappointment.",The Woman in the Window

179,lizxypopcornkid,"It's ok , but I'm disappointed",4,14 May 2021,The book is very well written and this film is a very poor adaptation.There are seriously important plot points that they skip out on all together and I was incredibly disappointed with the emphasis upon her condition (agoraphobia) being very little.Some visuals throughout which r due to her condition will make little to no sense as her condition isn't very well explained.Plus I think the sevens when she is on drugs and drinking were overly emphasised in an attempt to build tension that didn't really work.This film will be good if you haven't read the book and underwhelming if you have.Overall I think the adapted parts they have done are well done the acting is great( especially Amy Adams wyatt Russel and Fred Hechinger)but I'm very disappointed in the way this movie was handled.The director had a chance to bring attention to a rare condition and to make a great movie and sort of blew it by not completely following the book or detailing certain points.In other words it's a clusterfuk.,The Woman in the Window

It's well acted, by the whole cast, and it's well directed.This is a very good psychological thriller. Ignore the low ratings given by those who read the book, those ratings are not deserved.

It was quite boring during the first half and I almost didn't finish it. But the plot keeps your attention enough to want to find out what's really going on. I'm often a lazy viewer and prefer a linear sequence of events. Lol This movie is NOT that. It frequently jumps from past to present to what's in Anna's mind. Some of that had me looking at my phone, waiting for the scene to pass.It got more interesting to me when I thought I might know what was happening. It's when Anna's neighbor, Allistair, is yelling at her over her meddling with his family, specifically his son. He ends the rant with a desperate 'please' drop it. This change of tone made me think that his son was bad somehow. So of course, I had to find out if I was right.What really saved the movie for me was the fight for survival of the last 20 minutes. Anna had planned to take her own life after what happened with the neighbors. It was also because of her past wounds. Her fighting to live at the end showed that when she was actually faced with death that she wanted to live. I loved that. Then the movie had a 9 months later, where we get to see her healing. I'm glad I watched this movie and will probably watch it again. I'd like to see if I missed anything or maybe see it with another person to gauge their reaction.",The Woman in the Window

191,Instant_Palmer,Acting Excellence Earns This Film A Hall-Pass Despite Its Poorly Adapted Screenplay,7,19 May 2021,"A poor screenplay usually yields disappointment, and a low rating attached to my review - and this adapted screenplay is undeniably flawed.However, the excellent performances of the ensemble of top-line actors in 'The Woman In The Window' makes viewing this long-anticipated movie worth the invested time, and gets a rare hall-pass from me.Bruno Delbonnel's cinematography helps immensely, delivering unique scene structure and cinematic camera techniques that pay homage at large to Alfred Hitchcock, and the story itself paralleling one of his most critically acclaimed films 'Rear Window'.Hitchcock was a filmmaker's filmmaker, and Delbonnel pays tribute by unabashedly utilizing a large number of classic Hitchcockian (and Bergman) camera techniques to set the film's overall suspense tone, build tension and anticipation, establish metaphors, and bring the viewer into the thinking and emotions of the protagonist (eg. Spiraling stairwell scenes, bokeh close-ups, half-face shadowing, elevated camera angles, surreal imagery, dead-silent eye-contact moments, etc.), that add viewing-value.But this film was disappointing in its story telling, especially in its ending where I'm guessing scenes were left on the editing floor. Perhaps the reason the film took so long to release were triage-attempts to re-edit the story back into the film...this almost never works.Regardless, for me the experience of viewing such deft retro artistic filmmaking, and witnessing the superb acting performances by this highly capable cast (led by Amy Adams👏), was enough to garner a passing grade from me, and a recommendation to view.",The Woman in the Window

193,Bek204,"""You let some of the outside, COME IN""",6,14 May 2021,"The film is trying to be so many things at once. It's boring/slow most of the time and good at a very few moments. It's the perfect example of chaos. Now for those who don't know the film is based on a book, I personally didn't read the book ut I read that so many people said that the film focused on the dram side more than the thriller side and I could agree with that. Even though the film focused on the drama side, I didn't feel much except for a specific scene where the film reveals something to us that happened and those who watched the film will know what I'm talking about.The first hour of the film was so boring and then after the second half, it starts to get great and we get to see more things about the story and the main character. I personally got excited. But, when it started to get close to the end, it went down again and it was even worse this time. The ending was one of these endings that you would see in a cheap horror/thriller film where you will know where it's going and predict everything. Also, there were so many things and situations that happened in the ending and the entire film that were very unrealistic and stupid.I felt like the film was rushing at so many times. I was also confused at times and felt like there were so many holes and gaps in the film which ruined the whole story of the film. The script is a very huge problem in this film and that's what caused it to be this bad.Amy Adams' performance is great as always but although her performance is powerful it still didn't save the film and this is because the script is so weak. Every scene that Gary Oldmen was in, really surprised me and he did put a great performance although his screen time was not much. And there was one specific scene of him that I really liked which I wish if I can talk about but I will spoil the film. Julian Moore's performance too was a surprise. In my opinion, all the cast was great and each did a great job in their performance and they did deliver what their characters were supposed to deliver to the audience perfectly. But, like I said it still didn't save the film.The cinematography, production design, and much score all worked together to give us that thrilling/dramatic vibe perfectly. The camera movements sometimes made us if we are the main chatter so we get to know what she is feeling.In the end, I don't recommend anyone to see it except if you are looking to watch a film that would just kill your time.My rating is 6.5/10.",The Woman in the Window

For me, the movie is absolutely terrific - one of my all-time favorites. Amy Adams is just brilliant in the lead and paints a stunning portrait of a woman who is just about at wit's end. She is a mess - but she manages to gain all of your sympathy and, ultimately, respect. The supporting cast is familiar and they all have their fine moments, particularly Fred Hechinger as Ethan and Julianne Moore in a wonderful segment as Ethan's mother (or is she ?).The sets are remarkable and very well done - and if the director was trying to emulate Hitchcock's style and presentation, he did an excellent job. For me, this was Hitchcock re-incarnated, highlighted by a devastatingly sincere and complicated performance by Adams. I watched this a second time the next day, and for all you readers of the book who were disappointed with the movie, maybe you should take a second look. Sure, some of the details of the book are missing, but the script stayed very true to the main plots of the story. And on a second viewing, it all fits together expertly.",The Woman in the Window
195,peterDM-30380,Well Done. Great Acting.,8,15 May 2021,"Did you ever read some of the 1 star reviews here and think, ""I wonder what movies these people think are actually good?"" I'm guessing it's somewhere between ""Ernest Goes To Camp"" and ""Dumb and Dumber."" The fact is that this is a very well-adapted screenplay written by one of our finest living playwrights, Tracy Letts. Not only does he do well with helping us see the world through the eyes of an agoraphobe, he also does a wonderful job with keeping us guessing while creating balance with suspense and intrigue. The casting is excellent. Amy Adam's never makes us feel sorry for her; she makes us root for her. Playing the victim is probably an easy trap in a role like this, but she unravels in an expert fashion which makes her big moments at the end feel earned. Julianne Moore has always had a knack for making audiences feel delightfully uncomfortable. Her ability to always make you feel like at any minute she could snap and go over the edge lends terrifically to this role. If you are a fan of old Hitchcock, you'll enjoy this film. One of the earliest shots is of Jimmy Stewart in ""Rear Window"" playing on the TV.

201,theshanecarr,A-List Cast/B-List Results,5,25 May 2021,"I had gathered that this was not going to be an enjoyable watch so I came to this Joe Wright directed thriller steeled for a grim experience, but I was pleasantly surprised. For most of the run.Much has been made about the Hitchcockian vibes, and on a superficial level, it does resemble ""Rear Window"" - a thriller about someone confined to their home passes the time watching their neighbours and eventually witnesses a murder (or do they?) - but the tone is very different. Hitchcock always maintains a tone of delight in the depravity, or finds a way to have fun with the conventions or restrictions of the time. Woman has no time for any such larks which you cannot get away with when the plot is this crazy.What's most annoying is that Wright has form in the right area. ""Hanna"" remains his best film, and threads the needle between taking its premise seriously while knowing it's bonkers.I haven't read the source novel by A. J. Finn so perhaps the movie faithfully adapts the tone of the novel, but whereas ""Rear Window"" delighted in the pleasures of voyeurism, as James Stewart spied on, and got to know his neighbours via his binoculars, Wright, and Tracy Letts' screenplay, focus on the claustrophobia of being trapped in your own home.Perhaps the starting points made that inevitable; Stewart is trapped in his apartment due to a broken leg. Here Amy Adams is imprisoned by her own mind as her agoraphobia keeps her in. Stewart was chafing to get back out. Adams intends never to pass her front door again.The film (superficially) explore the reasons for her agoraphobia, leading to a portrait of a broken alcoholic who's resigned to plodding on as she is. I could watch a movie about that but bolting it onto this OTT thriller plot does a disservice to the audience.It's a shame because Amy Adams has charm to spare, and she can bring a welcome lightness to sombre or dark narratives as she did in ""Arrival"", or ""Hillbilly Elegy"", but here she's overpowered by the broken nature of her character, and the utter lack of lightness in the script.Which is not to say that this doesn't have other charms. There are some extremely effective tension-building scenes as Adams fears she is not alone in the house, and some ludicrous but enjoyable drama as one character after another arrives into the house to shout and accuse. These scenes are so silly that they should have pointed the way to a more slyly knowing tone, but Wright has opted to lean into the dark and dreary of it all.But that cast! Gary Oldman! (Who must have felt he owed Wright for getting him the best actor Oscar in their previous collaboration on ""Darkest Hour""), Julianne Moore! Anthony Mackie! Jennifer Jason Leigh! Tracy Letts! Wyatt Russel! (Hot off his turn with Mackie in ""The Falcon and the Winter Soldier"".) Unfortunately, all of them are wasted - the narrative keeps them apart from Adams for large parts of the movie, and only Oldman and Moore get even a hint of a smidge of a taste of something to do.Wright isn't worried though because his direction is practically another character in itself. It's bold and showy and draws attention to itself at every opportunity. I often quite like that - I love some flash but here it's not in service of Adams' interiority, or of the plot, it's just flash for the sake of flash, and it adds to the alienating effect, making it harder to sympathise with our plucky protagonist.Where the film really comes off the rails is in the third act. This is a silly film that could have been great thriller trash had it embraced that. Instead Wright went full Christopher Nolan but the material can't support that heaviness, so when the third act revelations start piling up, it collapses under the weight of it's own ridiculous grim-dark.I was willing to just about (just about!) forgive the backstory to Adams' agoraphobia, but the leap into absolute off-the-charts silliness as the truth about what was going on becomes clear is too much to take. The film abandons its own pretensions to seriousness and becomes every rubbish direct-to-video thriller you've ever seen, complete with a character suddenly revealing everything for no discernible reason, and an action-packed climax at the location flagged half-way through just for that purpose.This had the potential to be Hitchcock-style fun from beginning to end, but while Wright took technical notes from the master on showmanship, he skipped the class on coherence and tone.Great direction comes in service to the story, not the other way around.",The Woman in the Window

211,paulmcuomo,How many talented people does it take to make a terrible movie? Apparently the entirity of the production staff on this film!,2,13 August 2021,"Well, before I start I have to admit two things here.Firstly, I watched this film a while ago, but I needed a bit of time to fully process everything.Secondly, I haven't read the novel the film is based on. However, after seeing the film, I'm not that devoted to doing so because this movie's premise is very quality neutral, in terms of it is alright on paper but execution is a big component of it. This film, and its screenplay and direction, executes this shockingly.The direction by Joe Wright is supremely misguided - and Joe Wright is an excellent director. However, for some reason, he seems to be trying to take these big, epic scene transitions that he think will work in an arthouse style, but instead are just a massive distraction considering the complete lack of events happening in this story. Literally, the plot of this movie is former therapist Anna (Amy Adams) is having agrophobia, and during an incident with some kids harassing her, a woman Jane, played by Julianne Moore in a very thankless role, comes, talks to her and has some drinks and then vanishes. This woman is later on being seen stabbed by her husband Alistair, played by Gary Oldman in a role that again is thankless but Gary Oldman nails through the sheer virtue of being Gary Oldman, and begins to suspect things about the family - this is only heightened when she meets Alistair's wife Jane, a completely different woman played by Jennifer Jason Leigh. All of this is set up early, but the rest of the movie are very repetitive dream sequences, occasional meetings with Anna's therapist played by Tracy Letts, again a very talented writer who seems unable to wring quality from a reasonable premise...
...and the ending. Oh. My. God, the ending.The mark of a bad story is when a mystery takes you by surprise, but not because you didn't anticipate it, but more because it's so stupid that you could never have seen that happening. And the worst part is the one thing I can say good about the movie is the cast work their damned best, even in limited roles such as Anthony Mackie or Brian Tyree Henry who don't appear in many scenes at all; this is except for one person, that being Fred Hechinger as Ethan, who is never convincing at any point in the film for what he is. Without spoiling too much, his character does a complete 180 that comes completely out of left-field, and worse than that, the reasoning makes no sense either. It's completely unrealistic, and worst of all contains probably the worst use of plot armour I've ever seen in a story - I won't mention it here because it is genuinely stupid and is completely not fitting with the characters as shown to this point.The only reason I've given this two stars is because the cast, mostly, were doing good work.

212,greenwriter-972-149612,Starts out...sort of ok,5,22 May 2021,"The Woman in the Window starts out...sort of OK. The camera work is good. Amy Adams is always at the very least watchable. She's often compelling. But soon you'll discover that this isn't a role for her. It's best suited to someone of lesser potential range and nuance. Sometimes less is more. And there's so much less in this film that Adams' hard work seems almost counter-productive. And then there's the unfortunate casting of Julianne Moore. She's rarely looked as bad on film as she does in this thing. Way too old to be playing the part she's ben assigned, the director decided to sort of cover that up with an annoying neurotic portrayal. One so irritating that we'd overlook the fact that Ms. Moore is at least a quarter century...or more...too old for her part. And, it's Julianne Moore. She's not top billed so you know she's going to get killed. And get killed she does. And here is where the movie takes a drastic wrong turn. It tries...and tries hard to play out as a psychological thriller. Right after Ms. Moore's 50th on-screen death, there are some pretty taut moments. Then the whole thing falls apart. Instead of 'Rear Window Meets Wait Until Dark' we get another really, really dumb slasher flick. Complete with the old garden tools to the face nonsense. This could have been a good film.

Fortunately, my watch died and I didn't bother lighting up my screen and hence to me, the movie ended at so many different places (Like Donny Darko, you may pick your ending but without the director's intention). It's not predictable and it's definitely not unconvincing but neither is it the greatest.While the movie did feel like it could do with quicker scenes and reduced pauses, Dr. Anna Fox (Amy Adams) did a fantastic role of convincing everybody. The characters might seem weird, but hey it's NYC! The movie is unique, entertaining and a great Halloween watch if you don't prefer Horror.

Not sure why the family across the street was ""in custody"" unless they knew their son had killed someone. Cops were kinda typical and emotionless. David's character seemed a little wasted as it played little dramatic part. And I really didn't understand how, if Ethan killed his mom, how they didn't see any evidence of it or blood in the apartments if they checked it. So, I was mildly entertained, but left wanting more out of this one.",The Woman in the Window

When?When a film has sufficient depth and it's also credible, the characters are well developed and it's fairly well directed, as per this one, you don't need such a twist at the end! That's what they do on B movies like ""Scream"", not on good films like this. It just ruins the whole piece of art.Why this obsession with being original when what we actually need is tangible, human, real stuff. Even if it's a fantasy film. We need depth. Especially now after lockdown when we've been feeling so alienated and so isolated from our peers.I loved all the performances, that's the best asset of the film without a doubt. What a cast! It almost feels like a waste, so much talent with such little screen time!

Without a doubt Rear Window from 1954 comes to mind and I can only say that Alfred Hitchcock won since with much less he provides us with the suspense that The Woman In The Window lacked. I must say that I am a fan of Joe Wright movies and this is not at his level, it will not change the perception I have of him as a filmmaker because I want to think that the decisions that hurt the film were not made by him (based on some productions by Scott Rudin) so I'll pretend I never looked at it. I also have to mention that the best thing was the music, excellently achieved by Danny Elfman where he takes us on a journey of horror classics, exactly what the movie dealt with in many ways but with mediocre results, I can't wait to listen to it in full and enjoy the heartbreaking cry of the violins.",The Woman in the Window

It definitely isn't a masterpiece either, but when it comes to mindless thrillers on Netflix, there is far worse all over the place. For one, what makes this film better than some low-rate Hitchcock-remakes is Amy Adams' fantastic lead performance as an agoraphobic woman who physically cannot leave her house. She effortlessly breathes life into the mysterious aspects of her character and creates tension despite acting alone for much of the movie. Much of the other performances in the movie are good as well, and no one feels like they are simply there to get paid and leave.The entire buildup of this movie was heavily enjoyable and kept me guessing until the final act of the movie. Some of the editing could be better, but it never ruins the movie. The movie gets a little too ridiculous for me in the very last 20 minutes, in which the true villain is finally revealed and a final fight scene occurs. This reveal seems like an afterthought to the rest of the movie, and the final fight sequence was clearly added in reshoots that felt tacked onto the finished product. Even though the ending doesn't quite land, THE WOMAN IN THE WINDOW is still quite thrilling and a fun watch on a rainy afternoon. B.",The Woman in the Window
228,silentfilm-2,A riff off of Hitchcock's REAR WINDOW that doesn't build suspense,4,22 May 2021,"The Woman in the Window (2019/2021) is a ""new"" Netflix film that was actually made a couple of years ago. With a stellar cast like Amy Adams, Julianne Moore and Gary Oldman, you would think that this would be a good movie, but it is a disappointment.First of all, the novel that it is based on is a rip-off of Hitchcock's Rear Window (1954). And the film's director shows Adam's character watching clips from Rear Window, Laura, and Spellbound in a nod to those films, but she doesn't actually get any clues from the plots of those films. The story concerns Amy Adams, who has agoraphobia, and is afraid to leave her giant house in Manhattan. (It must cost a fortune.) She has no visible means of support except for renting her basement to a male tenant who may or may not be creepy. She thinks her neighbors across the street are abusing their teenage son and later witnesses the stabbing of the neighbor's wife. Or does she? Adam's character is taking pills for depression and drinking wine when she should not be. She seems to be having hallucinations.The director likes to scare us with loud sounds at unexpected times. But the story missed one important thing about suspense. In all of Hitchcock's film, we knew who the bad guy was, and it was very clear when the protagonist was in danger. In this film, characters lie about what happened and we are not sure if what Amy Adams (and we) saw was an hallucination. Adams character goes from wanting to commit suicide to fighting for her life in about 10 minutes. It doesn't create suspense, and we really don't care what happens to her.",The Woman in the Window

Amy Adams is not likable or sympathetic. Gary Oldman and guy who plays David give only decent performances. Direction is terrible, disjointed, and leaves major plot points out of the book. There's no exposition or understanding of why Anna has become a shut in.Seriously can they not do a faithful adaptation of a book? When I saw that Amy Adams bought the rights to this I was excited .....but it is so very bad.Honestly make it stop.

I get that this is a very complex book to turn into a movie; in the book very little is happening for much of the time. But with each chapter it gets more and more intriguing. Here, they've cut several important aspect of the book to speed things along but sadly lost much of the intrigue along the way. Consequently characters are underdeveloped and Anna's agoraphobia not explored enough. One final thing; Gary Oldman. What the actual?? I've never particularly liked him but he is atrocious in this.

This film is not without flaws, there is definitely areas where things could have been tightened up & such but overall the point it's trying to get across is achieved. Here's a woman who's spent a large portion of her life hiding from her personal demons, who is then is forced at a point to confront life on a much larger scale, a situation which will end up on so many levels, changing the very fabric of her being. An event transpires that will shatter her protective dome - that prison she has confined herself in - forcing her to face her fears, the all seeing eye as it spans the world beyond the window - should she escape, or be forced out...either way a choice will no doubt have to be made.",The Woman in the Window

This however, was not...It was, as always, we'll made and well acted with an all star cast unbelievably, but the story just didn't hit the mark, especially at the beginning of act III 'the pay off' when it should.The first big reveal, for goodness sake, is just told to us, by a main character...

242,Lockout_Salties,A lackluster adaptation of a great book,4,15 May 2021,"When I first saw the trailers for The Woman in the Window, I was immediately intrigued. (Psychological thriller with Amy Adams and Julianne Moore? Sign me up!) And so, in preparation for the movie, I read the book. And let me tell you the book is a capital p capital t page turner. It was about 400 pages long and I read it in pretty much one sitting. The plot was well-constructed, the main character had a very distinct and interesting voice, and overall it was a great read. The one disappointing part was the ending (which we will get to).That was over a year ago. I had been waiting for around 15 months for this, and it simply didn't deliver. Don't get me wrong, the film has its strengths, but ultimately they're outweighed by its very noticeable flaws.Firstly, I didn't really like Amy Adams' performance. It felt really one-note and she didn't demonstrate as much depth as the character in the book had. Don't get me wrong, I really like Amy Adams, but she just felt very miscast in this movie. It would've been better if they had someone who has pulled off neurotic in the past, like Kirsten Dunst or Emma Stone.But my second and biggest problem with the film is that the ""scary"" moments are laughably awful. Two particular moments in the film are supposed to be intense, but are so ridiculous that I couldn't help but chuckle a little. Even the ending is hideously anticlimactic, with the only real highlight being a few unintentionally funny parts within it. But as a pay off to the story? Weak. It doesn't even explain most of the mystery and leaves entire plot threads hanging (most notably what actually motivated the murderer to kill Jane Russell).There are some bright spots to the film, most notably the supporting performances. Gary Oldman is quite intimidating as the father Russell, Julianne Moore is convincing as Jane, and even the relative newcomer. Fred Hechinger is good (until the latter part of the film where his performance falls apart).Overall, The Woman in the Window is a major disappointment, riddled with plot holes and so-bad-it's-good moments. It doesn't improve upon the only notable flaw in the book, and actually makes it much worse along with everything else from the source material. It has its moments, but only a few, and they certainly aren't worth the rest of the movie. I recommend you read the book instead.Final Score: 42/100.",The Woman in the Window

250,goldenlampshade,A pleasant surprise bad reviews nonwithstanding,10,6 June 2021,"I went into The Woman in the Window after reading a review attempting to tear down the piece but only making me want to watch it more. An ambitious neo-Hitchcockian thriller where Amy Adams does nothing all day but roam her egregiously posh NYC apartment cosplaying as the guy from Rear Window, life goals by the way, sounded like a lot of fun. And guess what, it is!I see some complain that the characters don't act like real people and I have some news for them: this is not a documentary of your local grocery store this is a thriller and these people are actors. None of this is real. It is intentionally stagey and melodramatic. I don't go bursting into monologues about sanity but damn does it make for compelling cinema.This honestly gets my positive review for being a well crafted albeit pretentious affair (I would not want to ever ever EVER be in the same room as the director because oh my goodness does the direction reek of multiple diagnosable superiority and narcissistic complexes, though realizing it's Joe Wright maybe he gets a pass for making Atonement and Darkest Hour) and it gets my perfect rating for that monologue halfway though the movie and I'm trying to stick up for an unduly hated upon flick. Back to the monologue though, I swear they thought they really had some gold on their hands and that that would be the scene to finally win Amy her Oscar (and I know that was the point in the script her and her agent signed on in the first place) but yea this flopped unfortunately.It's one of those things where I'm the only person in the world that likes it apparently though so long as there are people who can appreciate a well told story with detective aspects and easily digestible themes like grief rather than every movie trying to be an allegory for the Iranian middle crisis or something then I will continue to sing its praises.

As im writing this this ive had to change rating from a 6 to a 4, by the time im finished this is gonna be a 2. Gary Oldman and Julianne Moore are worthy of so much more.

Non linear plots are really interesting when in the hands of director and editors who are masters of the craftAbsolutely stellar cast, from Kurt Russell's son toJulianne Moore, but efforts are stultifying. When you create or experience great art, the finished product is always greater than the sum of its parts. Instead here we have a series of actors coming and going into a scene, emoting loudly for random reasons that must have been discussed elsewhere in some other movie, then leaving abruptly accompanied by a soundtrack of creepy woodwinds strings and percussion and samples from Dark Side of the Moon.It gets a final grade of 3, given this was probably rushed to market in post covid vacuum.

It doesn't matter what movie Amy Adam's is in and how good/bad it is, she always is fantastic. She plays an agoraphobic person well and pretty much holds the entire movie together.I was expecting a more heavier thriller, but this feels more like a drama/murder mystery. Which still works, as it's been cut to be a more slow pace movie, like the reviews have already pointed out.The cast will also draw in viewers - Julianne Moore, Gary Oldman etc. However, that is about it.The storyline itself is really, really flat. And doesn't go into detail at all about why Amy Adam's, became a drug abusive, agoraphobic, alcoholic. I was disappointed to see that Amy Adam's has barely snooped on her neighbours and picked up the camera, before the ""murder"" takes place. And in the book, this build up is really vital in fleshing out her character... her habits (never showering), her breakfast (wine and drugs drugs), how she passes time, (counselling online and watching her neighbours, knowing their movements inside out), the only way she can live her life (through others), her obsession of 1950s movies, her flashbacks and back story as to why her family died and how. I mean they cut out an entire arc, where she tried to keep her family alive on ice for 2 days and watched them die slowly, all because she had an affair.One third of the book is pretty much erased, which is a mistake. As the entire book is a thriller based on Amy Adam's psyche and state of mind. Her anguish, depression, loneliness and mental state, further eroded by this murder, which no one else believes happened.Totally vital storylines cut out of the film, which is why this movie is so flat. Amy's character doesn't really have any depth. But she does well to role with what she's been given in this movie.You're also not convinced that Gary Oldman is a psycho neighbour to be intimated of. His scenes are totally rushed and there's no creepiness to his character.Jennifer Jason Leigh's character was also glossed over. Scenes again cut out, where Amy Adam's stalks her heavily. And even manages to make it out the house to follow her to a cafe.Removing all these vital storylines, only battered the tempo and thrill level of this movie.It's basically like Jurassic Park, remade without the Velociraptors and T-Rex. Major plot cleansing.Still, you're left with a movie which is watchable and doesn't really need a brain cell to follow. You're not left on the edge of your seat. And by the time the killer is revealed, you couldn't give a toss about him.So, this movie is rated 7/10 purely because of Amy Adams and Julianne Moore's acting ability. And how well she did to run with a butchered storyline.(Otherwise, would have rated this 5/10). It's defo watchable, but just don't expect a heart racing thriller.",The Woman in the Window

269,SGuiliano1064972,Tell Mama,6,16 May 2021,"This cheesy Thriller has it's thrills but talented Amy Adams proves she can carry any kind of Mystery Thriller. Based on the novel by A. J. Finn, THE WOMAN IN THE WINDOW centers on, Anna (Sounds Familiar?), (Amy Adams) an agoraphobic woman who's confide to her house as she befriends a neighbor, Jane (Julianne Moore) across the street from her apartment and then later she witnesses a murder committed as she watches it in her camera. Or was it a murder? She claims to the police detectives that she's not insane then weird things starts to happen to her. Mind Games are explored here in this Film. But there are some flaws in the story. Especially, the story overall. Anna goes through all these hallucinations and demons of her past as she tries to overcome them. I'm not saying the film directed by Joe Wright, is bad but It's certainly Not SHARP OBJECTS.My rating could have been lower since Adams is a gifted and versatile actress. 6.0.",The Woman in the Window

I was actually rooting for this movie since the trailer came out in the late 2019. But the movie itself is waaay less interesting than its trailer. Don't get me wrong, actings are great, but that's pretty much all. It's as if some producers ""felt like"" doing a movie that will profit them %100 and wanted to take literally 0 risks and therefore they casted some best known actors and served us a story that we've all been watching for the last 20 years.",The Woman in the Window

The film even winks at the audience as a slow pan shows a still-frame of Jimmy Stewart being chocked by Raymond Burr on a monitor. And as it progresses there are great similarities to Rear Window, as well as many Hitchcock-inspired film ""gimmicks"" which I will not elaborate. But towards the end, things change and twist, and I found the ending quite satisfying.Six stars solely for Amy Adams' performance. She does a fantastic job.",The Woman in the Window

I feel like critics are obsessed with ""woke"" stuff that they forgot sometimes we wanna just watch a movie without having some kind of political propaganda shoved down our throats. I think the critics are wrong. I think this film is brilliant and I did not find it predictable and it created the right amount of tension to raise my heart rate.

275,moviebuff-90191,A must-watch psychological thriller,10,14 May 2021,"I just finished streaming this on Netflix...wow! ""The Woman in the Window"" is a very good film! I found it to be an edge-of-your-seat psychological thriller.Amy Adams is brilliant, and the rest of the cast are also very talented actors as well.I never got bored watching this, however as a film buff I've watched many many psychological movies and I found an element of this film to be predictable...the aspect with the husband and daughter...I knew something wasn't right there, due to the fact that they never visited the house, we the viewers never saw them once, and then eventually the situation with the husband and daughter was confirmed.However, the other aspect of this film was ambiguous, I didn't know at all where they were going to go with the story line of Gary Oldman's character's wife/ his son Ethan's mother.The plot-twist is clever and you can tell that the Director and Producers were influenced by the old horror style movies because for a short moment the movie has a strong 1960s horror-esque vibe after the plot-twist reveal.Something that I want to say about Netflix...it would be good to give the viewers the option of watching the end credits, some of us like film music, and after this film finished - I couldn't help but want to absorb the entire viewing experience from the start to the very end and really wanted to just let the end credits play until the end, but as soon as the end credits rolled - about 3 seconds after - it went straight to a Trailer for another movie.As a lover of film music, I love the Score by Danny Elfman, he's one of my favourite film composers and his music always has a dark and thrilling atmosphere, his Score suits this motion picture.The Woman in the Window has an awesome atmospheric vibe, the overall style of this cine is different than what we usually see on film. I feel that the Director and Producers were inspired by older thrillers.I have the novel, but have never read it and i'm glad I made that choice because I did not want any spoilers.I recommend this movie, again Amy Adams as Dr. Anna Fox is amazing.Something I want to say as an animal lover, I don't like that the cat got injured later on in the movie, I don't know how he got injured, but i'm glad that at least he didn't die and overall was okay.The Woman in the Window - a must-watch psychological thriller.",The Woman in the Window

Rain, running, knife close ups, die by skylight. (How much water was on that roof, I'd be worried more that the ceiling was to cave in, than my neighbors across)My main question why all these Oscar winners for five minute bit parts that they obviously didn't care about? Favors? The recognized actors sort of took you out of the story. The acting by ""kid"" Russell was awful. Was that character needed?Basically a short film strung out to an hour 1/2.

285,ian-dodkins,Definitely worth watching.,8,17 May 2021,"This film has great acting, fantastic photography (loved the colors, effects and angles, but it's not arty), good mood music (dramatic but not intrusive) and absolutely 100% perfect pacing. By that I mean no part is too long and it fits together perfectly (most modern films seem to have half an hour or a bad guy/woman chasing someone around the house at the end). The two major twists were well delivered and mostly unexpected. I've not read the book but the film had me gripped all the way through. Characters were well portrayed and balanced the plot well.Why negative reviews here? I'm 49 and have watched many many films. Yep, there is something reminiscent of Alfred Hitchcock in the wit of the plot and the mystery, and also the main character watches alot of old black and white mystery/murder films which appears to be a nod to these films from the black and white era. However, it's a very good film in its own right and in no way copies a story from another film (unless you think witnessing a murder from a window is copying a story).In many ways this is a perfect film for its genre (suspense/murder mystery) in the modern era. Thankfully not a period type murder mystery, but with a focus on the problems of this woman with agrophobia. No plot holes that I could see at all, and seemed entirely believable and emersing. I think the negative comments maybe come from officionados of murder mystery who will always consider older material better, or those that just don't like this style of film (and let me repeat it's not the type of film with the whole estate gathered around the bloody candlestick in the library type of film, it's partly psychological mystery drama type).I'd say for any adult this is a thrilling and gripping film. Very glad I watched it. Although unlikely to be film of the year (partly because of genre and theme) or top 20 films ever made (and not in my top 20 either I doubt) it was a well crafted and extremely enjoyable film that I highly recommend.",The Woman in the Window

So u have to say the script ans the directing is it's biggest fail.Some choices made by the director baffled me.

It's currently top three most popular on Netflix (as of this post) and it has some big name actors.I watched this for similar reasons. I like Amy Adams and 'Rear Window' is my favorite Hitchcock movie. However, when I put this on with my friends, I quickly was facing jeers every time something dumb happened.This movie opens fairly well with an interesting setup of Amy Adams shut inside because of her crippling agoraphobia. The issue is, it's kind of unbelievable. There's little reason it seems why the new neighbors would give Amy Adams any thought let alone get her a gift. Did she talk with them before the movie started?There's a lot in this movie that makes you think that you missed something. I also didn't appreciate the artificial suspense. Scary music shouldn't be what makes a scene suspenseful even though that's what happened in a lot of the movie.All in all, I regret watching this and watching 'Rear Window' is a better use of your time.",The Woman in the Window

The film has its moments, keeps you guessing a bit, but in the end really has nowhere to go. Amy is always compelling to watch on screen, she's just so good, and still, at 47, very pretty. But the plot never really congeals. An excellent cast, but Julianne Moore overacts a bit, and violates the basic ""never let them catch you acting"" mandate. Not a bad effort altogether, just not any of their best work. Look for Amy in Sharp Objects, some of her best work there, go back to The Professional, and Romeo is Bleeding to see Oldman in top form. Jennifer Jason Leigh, who I didn't actually recognize at first, in The Hateful Eight, Oscar nominated there. And, to be fair, on a slow night this one isn't bad.",The Woman in the Window

This film was a masterpiece until the climax which is a big letdown.There was a better expository way to build to a conclusion of this film, unfortunately it just leaves me puzzled how it was initially scripted compared to the finished film. Tracy Letts did not write this ending, at least I hope not. I recommend the movie to anyone who loves film and studies it. A masterclass in suspense, derailed.",The Woman in the Window
296,kshirad,Nice little Hitchcock-lite thriller,8,14 May 2021,"I didn't have any expectations going into this and given Netflix's track record for putting out some lackluster stuff, also how this movie was a victim of the now-Disney-owned 20th Century Fox acquisition, I went in with a pretty low expectation. Well, turns out it's better than I thought.The plot revolves an agoraphobic woman, Anna Fox, with a baggage from her past, who witnessed something she shouldn't have that has to do with her neighbor from across the street that leads her into a rabbit hole of investigation to uncover what really happened and the mystery it entails.From the outset it seems just like a rip-off ""Rear Window"" or other Hitchcock's works, and it is quite similar to an extent. But the way it was executed is quite interesting to say the least, from its' disorienting flow that makes you question if the events that are unfolding is only in her head to the stage-y, almost play-like way it was shot and manipulated. Although some of the style was a bit overdone, but it's enough to keep my attention without taking me out of it.It's not perfect and it takes a while to get going, but once it kicks I was fully on board with it, especially the final 15 minutes, which could make it or break it for you.At this point, no one can deny Amy Adams' talent for acting as she is almost in every shot of this movie and she carried it all the way through. You could see the range from her sadness and desperation as she goes through her paranoia living alone in her apartment while trying to control her anxiety from the outside world. This could almost work as a one-woman play.While the rest of the casts got overshadowed by her, Julianne Moore did a good job as her not-quite-alright neighbor in her brief screen time, also Wyatt Russell as one of her tenants that makes you doubt whether he's in on it or not. The only one weak link for me is (surprisingly) Gary Oldman, who overacted a bit in his role, but thankfully not to point of distraction.In conclusion, it's a nice little solid thriller that could quench your thirst for some Hitchcock. Don't expect something spectacular and you'll enjoy it even more.",The Woman in the Window

Heck, all they needed was a smoke/steam machine and every 90s production value box would've been ticked.Amy does a good job in this but it is Julianne Moore who steals the film in a very small role. One of the big problems is that none of the remaining supporting cast come across as even remotely believable - particularly the 15 year old kid that looks and acts 25. As such, you're left with Amy to do all of the heavy lifting and she manages quite well, although I never got the the sense that she was actually agoraphobic which is pivotal to the story.And if you thought the look of the film was even slightly 90s then wait for the finale! It's got the rain, the convenient rickety skydome, the spoken explanation of everything and even a bit of gratuitous violence thrown in.Overall, it isn't as bad as people say.

Very predictable.

However, since the new scenes were in the house you knew it was the same movie.

Don't have popcorn, out of boredom you will eaten all it in the first fifteeen minutes.Very predictable with cues in the movie that shout out remember me. Not subtle in the least.

Like, I thought ""maybe there is gonna be the son but no, that Is so cheap and it doesn't make sense. This is getting somewhere else"" but then, it WAS the son all along and I just didn't get it.I don't know, I guess we missed some context described in the book that made more sense.

321,JessicaCatrionaGray,Amy Adams Oscar's campaign starts NOW,10,14 May 2021,"Mysterious and gripping from the very first moments, The Woman in the Window is the most thrilling film in recent memory, elevated by committed performances and stunning cinematography unlike anything seen in recent memory.The Woman In The Window is one of my absolute favorites of the year. It's ambitious, stylistic, and a very uniquely woven story that fully submerges you into the mystery at hand. I2 years of anticipations and I must say, it was worth the wait!The agoraphobia angle is a great way to create this feeling for Adams' character that she doesn't have anyone who will believe or help her. We are put in her shoes the same as the characters in the other two films I mentioned. It's that inability for us to get away from this situation. That makes the character so engaging. We want her to be correct despite everything pointing to her being wrong. It's a classic trope, but works.Adams though gives the performance of her career. She takes these words and she makes them entirely believable coming from her mouth. Her phobia and neurotic nature play perfectly in the hands of this woman with this compulsive disease. She was perfectly cast in this role. I couldn't see another actress in this role. Also in a career-making performance is Fred Hechinger as the son who has much more going on than anyone could have imagined. He is beyond what I could have expected.SHE MUST WIN BEST ACTRESS FOR THIS ROLE !",The Woman in the Window

There is no main focus; it lacks a certain goal to perceive which in the long run doesn't give you the satisfaction you've been looking for...What's more, this movie's genre is undeterminable, you can assign it to either mystery, thriller or anything else really. Moreover, the twist at the end isn't really anything mind-blowing, it's definitely that one puzzle piece which is right in front of you.Now reasons for why I'm giving it just a 5/10 are:The characters are very flat. The movie doesn't give you much insight about their life, one particular ""thing"" is the whole attention grabber, and it's definitely too little to not contain anything else.The setting is pretty dull and boring. It definitely lacks more places to be somewhat more diverse and interesting. Even though the title of the movie stands behind it, it should've still been a lot more setting affectionate.The pace of the movie is way too slow. It would've been a different scenario if the movie was more informative.A typical cop-menace-protagonist type movie.

Even mediocre remakes like Disturbia and Flight Plan have entertained me in the past. A psychological thriller is difficult to mess up.Well, they did it. This movie has no conflict for the first 30 minutes. Really nothing happens but characters meeting each other in uneventful conversations. All in the same setting. It feels like a bad play.Then we the central event actually happens, it feels so silly. The rest of the movie is a series of incompetent characters incapable of communicating the most basic of facts right. Withholding crucial information for no reason, and focusing on stupid details to dismiss huge events.And I feel like I should add a star for the ending, because it made me laugh out loud and had me in stitches through what must be the most hilariously incompetent pursuit I have seen in film.But it was bad. So bad it is entertaining bad, but bad not the less.But five minutes of unintentional laughs are not enough to compensate for two hours of boredom.

How stupid is just this idea! A secretary is pushed out of the window from the 5th floor, but nobody bats an eyelid and no one talks about it the whole movie!

The book was so good and had me on the edge of my seat the entire time.The movie, however, was so cringe! Missing characters, missing plots, underdeveloped characters, void of any suspense, it does not do the book justice at all.In the book the ""phone calls"" between Anna and her husband and daughter were very detailed and you truly believed she was on the phone with her husband and that they were alive, at least for a quarter of the book. I'm not sure why the director chose to do the phone calls as voiceovers. It was really bad, and took away from the big reveal moment.We never met the physical therapist, Anna's lover, we don't discover that Anna secretly ""counsels"" others online, Anna follows a woman that looks like Jane to a coffee shop. The movie doesn't follow the book with Dave & Anna, who in the book, have sexSo it was just rush, rush. A lot of details that just really added to the story whether they were relevant to the ending, the added characters create more depth.The ending was totally campy and I started to feel like I was watching a Lifetime movie or Night of the Living Dead.

She does the best that can be done with the material, but I feel like I should have more empathy for her character and I don't. I didn't read the book. I can only speak for the movie. It seems like a lot more could have been done here to make the plot a little more interesting and suspenseful.

I think there could have been a much better build up to that reveal.

And they casted a great actor for Det. Little, I thought he was very empathetic in the role. And the kid who played ... Ethan ... also fantastic.I plan to watch it again!

As someone's that's actually agoraphobic (but no longer believes the ableist views around the disorder), the whole thing is beyond an insult.If you understand ableism even slightly you should be offended by how much ableism there is in this. But that's no big surprise from things Netflix puts out.The acting was awful even though many of the actors have been in movies in the past that I used to like. Have they always acted his horribly and I'm just now noticing or was the writing and direction of this film so bad that it made them bad actors in it?The actors were bad. The plot bad and predictable. The ableism was sickening. Netflix rates this as 98% compatible with my likes.

345,VVMini,Amy Adams carries this surprisingly risky movie.,8,31 May 2021,"With all the negativity surrounding the movie, I was surprised by how much I liked The Woman in the Window. I read the book when it came out a few years back, so I was ready for all the stretching of my disbelief that was to come. Though I did forgot quite a bit of what happened so a few things were new to me.Since the bulk of the story was known to me, it gave me more time to appreciate the film making behind it. I really enjoyed the bizarre directions Joe Wright sometimes took the film in, from weird dreamlike sequences to almost breaking the fourth wall at times. It was a very risky approach to a movie that could have been played pretty safe, and I can appreciate that.But the real star of the movie was Amy Adams, who gave another exceptional performance. Completely vulnerable, she makes the sense of her losing her mind almost palpable. I was completely invested in her character, and she singlehandedly lifted this movie up for me. The same cannot be said of Gary Oldman, who was hamming it up so much that he was pretty much in an entirely different movie. I'm gonna chalk that one up to a risky approach that did not pay off. Or maybe it would have been riskier to have Oldman *not* ham it up, who knows.Anyway, it's far from a perfect movie, and the ending was a bit sudden and out of the blue, but I thoroughly enjoyed myself.

Also, the trailer had practically given away the plot and the twist. It was too slow and didn't succeed in making me care about the characters. The relationships seem shallow and superficial.

356,FreddieLee04,Not a bad stab at an up-to-date Rear Window.,5,10 June 2021,"This is my third Joe Wright movie after his 2005 take on Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice and his Oscar-winning war drama Darkest Hour and I have to say, his movies aren't my cup of tea. Both of those movies I found to be highly overrated - Darkest Hour especially - and whilst I can see the appeal for some, I have to cast some doubt over his directorial ability. Overall, I would say that The Woman in the Window is about the same quality as Darkest Hour, but not quite as good as Pride and Prejudice which is probably his best film - according to his fans.Amy Adams does very well here to lift a role out of the mud that was created by the script and Wright's shoddy direction. Without her, the movie falls to a 4 star rating, perhaps even lower. Other than her performance, what kept me entertained here were the Hitchcock references (that a big Hitchcock fan myself, understood) and the twists that somehow, mostly, didn't play into my expectations.Gary Oldman does his usual thing that he does in plenty of his films where he shouts and overacts, usually when he plays the villain or a main character. Yep, he does it here, but it isn't Jared Leto-style annoying, it's just a bit cringe-worthy at times. He plays the father in the family that Amy Adams' character spies on during the film, unfortunately, his character wasn't explored as much as I would've liked.The flashback sequences were great and added something different to the story- something that the 1954 classic Rear Window didn't have. Also, the finale was tense enough to keep me watching.I would only recommend watching this movie if you have a free 2 hours and you want some disposable entertainment, but something good enough to keep you watching and engaged. Like I say, Amy Adams is always worth watching, even if she's being directed by Joe Wright (who I am not a fan of).",The Woman in the Window

All these styles come out of nowhere and don't have any place to go, and the script felt uninspired and fragmented, with no real connection or resolution to each of them.

367,Monarch_1,"It's fine, I guess?",6,25 October 2021,"I am writing this review not having read the book on which the movie is based on. The movie follows the story of an agarophobic woman who happens to witness some sinister events taking place in the neighbour's house in the span of the week and pushes her into facing her own demons.Amy Adams delivers a very convincing performance as an agarophobic woman and carries the movie from the beginning to the end. The climax twist was also a solid one. Even though the movie boasts an ensemble cast of Gary oldman, Anthony Mackie, Julianna Moore and Wyatt Russell, it makes a complete waste of them by giving them very few scenes to work with.The runtime of the movie is short which might be a good thing for most movies but in this case, it handicaps the movie to rush through the scenes and not providing enough scenes to cement protagonist's family bond and confuse the protagonist (also viewers) of the potential antagonists.Having read and seen both Harry Potter novels and movies, I can understand the frustration of the other viewers here. But I also understand the difficulties in adapting a source from another medium and love Harry Potter movies as is. As a standalone movie, this is fine, I guess.

377,dipinheiro_dsp,Bad Plot,6,3 November 2021,"The premise of the film is very interesting, from the beginning to the middle of the film it holds you in a very captivating way, the whole plot around the main character who has depression and other psychological problems, in my opinion, is well developed. I really believe that if the film focused on the character's health picture and didn't engage in meaningless explanations during its climax, surely the film would be much better enjoyed. The script is at times opportunistic, without even bothering to disguise the facilities that are played on the screen to proceed with the story. And yet when it comes to the script, the most absurd thing is that when it reaches its climax the script is totally lost, the final explanations are meaningless, the motivation of the supposed ""antagonist"" of the story is even more meaningless and all that story about the investigation and curiosity of the protagonist loses its charm and we end up falling into the deepest sea of clichés.",The Woman in the Window

We spend the movie wondering if she has imagined it or not.Then there is the issue of a person living alone watching the windows of apartments on the other side of the street. As unrealistic as Rear Window when James Stewart did the same. No one in real life is ever able to see so much of people's lives through open windows. Normal people use curtains, blinds etc. But here the windows give unhindered visual access. Completely unreal.Worse than that, this movie is a bore.Sorry.",The Woman in the Window

If I didnt know the actors involved are generally very good I would think they had all been hired from the over acting theatre group as they each play their parts as if they are in a bad stage play.The central crime is so confused, you can't really engage with the heroines desire to solve it.Julianne Moore was fine but her, level, performance made it look like she was in another film.I kept looking at the time to see how long I had left to go and I was relieved when it ended.I'm searching for something positive to say as I don't want to be all negative but I cant think of anything. Watch Rear Window instead, that's a really good thriller. Or even the Steve Guttenberg take on the ""crime scene from a window"" that's quite fun too.

The only things I knew about it was what we got from the trailer, and that the reviews were mostly very negative. Going in I was expecting a contemporary 'Rear Window' and on that front, it is a far cry from the original. It lacks the intelligence and widespread detail of the Hitchcock film. However, that is hardly the core of the film. As a shocking and intense psychological thriller where reality isn't always clear from fantasy, the movie passes with flying colours. The plot is gripping and layered, the plentiful twists are handled masterfully, the ending is explosive satisfying, the cinematography is fantastic, and then there is Amy Adams. The whole cast is great, with special mentions to Gary Oldman and Julianne Moore, but this is Amy Adams' movie and she delivers not only one of the greatest performances in recent years, but easily the best of her already amazing career. Admittedly one or two scenes felt like they could've been a bit more polished, but this is still an incredible movie and well worth a watch, despite the negative reviews.",The Woman in the Window

I don't know what happened here, but somehow a passable, if somewhat paint-by-numbers, thriller got mired in odd visuals, implausible dialogue and - with the exception of Amy Adams and Julianne Moore - mediocre performances.It also helps to know what film you're making - the key component of a psychological thriller is well-crafted suspense, the gradual, wall-closing paranoia that leads to the big reveal. Here, we have scenes that are composed to evoke Hitchcockian classics - Rear Window, Vertigo, Psycho - but they only serve to remind the viewer that there was only one Hitchcock.",The Woman in the Window

402,Ofgumby,Vulnerable Woman Cliché,4,21 June 2021,"You've seen this movie a million times. It's another one of those vulnerable women in distress movies. This one has shades of Gaslight, What Lies Beneath, and Disturbia, and it opens with a shot from Rear Window almost as if to say, ""we know we're not fooling anyone here."" The main character falls asleep to Hitchcock films, which just seems a poor choice for someone in her situation (what would have been so wrong with ""Father of the Bride"" or ""Some Like It Hot""?)As a woman who likes to watch movies, I am t i r e d of these ""vulnerable woman finds her strength (only to be validated by a man)"" movies. And, boy, did they make Amy Adams vulnerable in this one! (Here there be spoilers, maybe) She has all the problems - A phobia, guilt, deep loss, drugs, alcohol, isolation, suicidal tendencies...It's a wonder she can sit upright at all. Plot points are forced - what handyman is going to borrow a kitchen knife to open boxes? Additionally, she's surrounded by Red Herrings - her neighbors, her tenant, her doctor. This movie really forced the point that she was an unreliable narrator and ""everybody's a suspect!"" (insert Randy gif here).The four stars I gave this movie are all for Amy Adams. Her performance was amazing for the material she had to work with. I hear the book is better, so maybe bypass this movie and go straight to the book.

407,boomroasted,Petition for an Amy Adams Oscar,6,23 June 2021,"Agoraphobic Dr. Anna Fox (Amy Adams) hasn't left her brownstone in NYC for ten months when she witnesses something disturbing across the street. Based on the best-selling novel by A. J. Finn, adapted by Tracy Letts (who plays Anna's therapist), and directed by Joe Wright.Immediately after watching this highly anticipated film, I was surprised by how much I enjoyed it! But during the following days, I ruminated, watched it again, and realized that while I still enjoyed the film, there were many things that irked me.The story behind the movie is pretty simple but also painfully similar to Rear Window (1954) by Alfred Hitchcock. And many other aspects made me feel like I had seen it before. 1. Gaslighting detectives playing good cop / bad cop. These scenes are always so frustrating as a viewer and make me question who to root for. 2. The '90s slasher inspired creative direction. It feels odd to me that we are splashing blood on a lens in 2021.One of the best aspects of the film is the stacked cast. Amy Adams is joined by Gary Oldman, Julianne Moore, and Jennifer Jason Leigh, to name a few. But outside of my queen Amy Adams, the other cast members made me cringe. This is due to their overacting (someone pointed this out about Gary Oldman, and now I can't unsee it) and their CHEESY dialogue. Julianne Moore talking about her son being ""her guy"" ... barf. Or Ethan Russel (Fred Hechinger) telling Anna that he didn't want to say anything about being allergic to cats because he didn't want to hurt its feelings... nope. Many scenes were hard to watch because of the dialogue, and that stuck with me even days after watching.Fortunately! Some aspects partially redeemed the bad. I enjoyed the cinematography, the score, and the pacing of the film. The cinematography was beautiful and artistic and impressed me many times. The music was perfectly suspenseful, and I liked how it was in sync with what was happening in the house (like a sink tap or lights dimming). I was initially surprised at the short 1 hour and 40-minute run-time, but I thought the plot progressions were paced well and kept me interested.It's a shame Amy Adams probably won't win an Oscar until 2050, but I will be right here rooting for her until it's her time. Even though some things frustrated me about the film, for some reason, I find myself constantly wanting to rewatch it.

I think I am more forgiving of implausible turns when it comes to the old thrillers than I am for pictures made in recent decades. We enjoy Hush Hush Sweet Charlotte, Hitchcock's pix and Wait Until Dark, Lady in a Cage, Snake Pit and other hysterical women victims even though we could shred them for the same things we despise about Woman in the Window.

Danny Elfman is one of my favorite film composers and he certainly delivers a moody compelling score. I found the cinematography to be top notch as well. The actors were all well-cast although I felt that Jennifer Jason Leigh's talents were a little underutilized. The plot kept me engaged and entertained throughout the story up until the ending which I thought was the weakest part of the movie - it just sort of wrapped up without any real consequence like an episode of Murder, She Wrote, hence the 8 star rating. I was left with too many questions to be fully satisfied. Would I recommend the film? Yes. Will hardcore Hitchcock fans be disappointed? As I am one of them, not exactly.

Rear Window is my favorite Hitchcock movie, and I see this movie as an homage to Hitchcock, especially to Rear Window, with 21st century concerns interwoven. The film employs an unreliable witness (the titular woman in the window), addiction, psychological interpretation of evil, and lots of action that turns on cell phone use.

What is a decent plot line ends up disjointed and hurried, put together through convenient character fluctuations and band aid occurrences within it.Amy Adams plays Anna Fox, a child psychologist who suffers from Agoraphobia. She attends weekly in house therapy for this but it's far from the only issue she has, severe anxiety being one of her other conditions (although they all are related). When new neighbors move in, her curiosity is aroused and through observation and one has to assume, inquiry, she finds out a bit about the new tenants. After a visit from the son of the new neighbors where he says he is there to drop off a gift, Anna's intuition reveals there is troublenin paradise across the street. But this is where the movie loses a step. Anna has a tenant who lives in her basement. At first he is understanding and kind and it seems and helps her with things like repair work and handy stuff. Then, later on in the movie, he conveniently becomes enraged with her when he discovers her in his apartment which is attached to her house. While not unreasonable he would be perturbed and wonder why she was there, she regularly calls upon him for things; the rage seems to only serve the purpose of making his character seem like a suspect in her concerns about the neighbors and the sounds she is scared of in her house. It is also odd how a person who is so nervous and scared would allow the entire family into her home, but that is more an inconsistency rather than inaccuracy.The police who answer her call when she witnesses the first real act of violence are probably the worst and most conveniently egregious exaggeration to aid the idea that Adam's is imagining this whole thing. At first they seem professional and understanding, then quickly switch to questioning her in a way that is absurd and accusatory when nothing has been revealed to indicate she is guilty, a couple of times in tandem with Oldman who is shouting at her in her own home. No professional police officer would do this, they are trained to ask questions and take statements, not sides.At the end of the film, one of the detectives comes and apologizes which redeems a but of the ridiculous nature of it, but the flip flopping of demeanor is a bit much to believe. After this apology, Adam's is back at her house and moves out, seemingly cured of the Agoraphobia which plagued her the entire film before.It's not a terrible movie, but does leave you feeling a bit confused on what you've just watched and feeling underwhelmed, like an average lunch.1.",The Woman in the Window
420,jamessmithurst,I went to the toilet.,1,19 June 2021,"Ever watched a movie where you can't wait for it to be over? Even your cats turn their backs to the screen and rather wander off into the cold?Well, that's how it felt. Vaguely based on Alfred Hitchcock's 'Rear Window', starring James Stewart, this copycat movie is unbelievably boring. The acting is poor, especially the overacted scenes by Gary Oldman and the murderer kid (who is 25 years old in real life) doesn't pass as a 15-year-old.Typical stereotypical hysterical woman hallucinating (or not), stuck in a big house with bad people coming and going which confuses her. Ho hum. Bad script. Too many kitsch effects.",The Woman in the Window

Judging by the comments, it could have been a short TV-show to include all the details book readers missed from the movie, but in a movie it had to be skipped, which left some people disappointed (understandably so). For me, however, it was still a solid story with two of my favourite actresses - Amy Adams and Julianne Moore, who never disappoint. I enjoyed watching. Very underrated, I've seen a lot of much higher rated trash lately, so I'm really glad I found this gem.",The Woman in the Window
422,vincenzoangeloni,"Fantastic to me, but not to others",10,29 May 2021,"I watched this movie, mainly because I love all the actors in it, and I knew the plot would be really cool. I usually never do this, but this time I made a point of not checking the movie's IMBb score until I was finished, because I wanted an unbiased viewing. From the very beginning, I was completely blown away and gripped to the intriguing story. I thought to myself ""this has to be at least above a 7.5 or something on IMDb!"" or ""Amy Adams needs to be up for best actress for this!"" or ""the cinematography is amazing!"" I loved the entire movie the whole time I was watching it, and then I checked IMDb and saw that it was at 5.8! I thought that was insane. It seems like everyone, critics and casual viewers, all decided that this was a bad movie. By reading negative reviews of the movie I just thoroughly enjoyed, I realized that a number of the things people decided was bad about The Woman in the Window were things that I thought were great. For instance, I thought this was an Oscar-worthy perfect performance from Amy Adams, but other people say it was overacted. I was completely immersed in the mystery and twists, but other people say they were predictable. This made me realize something. I formed my unbiased opinions as I watched the movie with no other influence on my thoughts to sway me from positive or negative opinions. Now I see that my opinions are considered ""incorrect"" by most other critics. This shouldn't stop someone from enjoying a movie they want to enjoy. Everyone's entitled to their own opinion, and mine is that this is a fabulous film. So I would recommend that you definitely watch this, and just feel what you feel like you should feel. Don't let other people's opinions stop you from enjoying a movie you would've enjoyed otherwise. If you watch it and decide you don't like it, that's great! Form your own opinions! I don't agree at all with what people say about The Woman in the Window, but that doesn't mean I'm ""bad"" at watching movies or that I don't know what I'm talking about. This is a fun movie, and I enjoy it. You may love it or hate it, and whatever your opinion is, is great.",The Woman in the Window
423,nfunkhouser-06147,Disappointed,4,16 May 2021,"I'm a huge fan of the book, but this movie left me feeling completely and utterly disappointed. I can get behind that usually films are new adaptations of books, but this movie still left out/brushed over some of the most important plot points. They put more effort into the dry humor than they did into planting clues as to who and what was going on in Anna's house.The writing and editing is laughable in the third act too. Like seriously ""they'll think you killed david"" yeah okay buddy, you're literally holding a knife with your fingerprints and you have no alibi. I literally could not help but laugh at the climax.All in all, if you've read the book, do not watch this. If you're a casual who just wants to find something to do on a rainy day and don't really care at the quality, I guess this will suffice for you.",The Woman in the Window

Her tenant was also a suspect, given his history but that would've been too easy to guess.I never would've guessed Ethan, he wasn't a good villain but he tried, I guess.Overall, great acting from Adams and Oldman, as expected!

The movie felt like more of a drama than an intriguing thriller like it was in the book. The dialogues sometimes were over the top and the pace lagging, the supporting actors only show up when it's convenient to keep the plot moving. Sadly there is nothing interesting about any one of them. Expect for Moore she nailed her part.Even the two biggest reveals of the story seemed lacklustre.

I mean, she even brags about her prowess at one point, so why doesn't her expertise and paranoia point right in his direction?

This was definitely one of the better ones! My husband had not read the book and also liked the movie and thought it was easy to follow. I watched it in one sitting, which is super unusual for me, mostly I fall asleep.Amy Adams was outstanding. I don't say that about a lot of actors, I don't have any favorites or care about who's playing whom. But she was really, really good.Yes, there was a rather graphic fight scene that seemed a bit like classic horror. But why not?

The story line agains focuses on a crime that is witnessed by the home bound protagonist. The story isn't well paced, somehow is even boring at a few moments. But when it gets back on track, it moves into complete Hitchcock mode, with white-knuckled tension and visually terrifying production. The film also gives a nod to two other Hitchcock classics, Psycho and Vertigo, which is very cool. It lingers maybe a few minutes too long at the end, but it still has a satisfying ending.

After a while, I figured there were only two ways this could go - I won't spoil it, if you're into that kind of thing - and naturally, it did go one of those two ways. However, the real disappointment was the sudden fight scene that I've probably seen a thousand times before. The ending was completely unnecessary and veered into a quasi horror/90's suspense thing. It could have ended a scene earlier and the story would have been complete.I haven't read the book and reviewed it as a film. If your'e bored, watch it. Just don't expect to have your paradigms shifted or your views of modern cinematography changed in any way. It's a simple, predictable piece of ...er... cinema.",The Woman in the Window

I truly hope she wins awards for her performance. The introduction was great, and you get hooked right away. There were some unexpected surprises along the way, and some things I figured out on my own. The setting of her character's home was dark and gloomy, yet comfy. I found it to be very realistic for this story.I think the film should have been a little longer so that we could have learned more about the other characters. When I saw that Gary Oldman, Julianne Moore, and Jennifer Jason Leigh were in the film, I thought to myself ""Oh, this is going to be great!"" I guess my expectations were a little too high, though. Their acting was outstanding, as usual, but they had such small parts to play. I wanted more!All in all, this film is worth watching and getting lost in.

A great modern example of what im describing is the movie Hush. I like Amy Adam's alot but even she was kind of vanilla throughout this film.

Amy Adams' character development is also written quite badly. Just makes no sense and very rushed. I think we can consider a movie bad when even these actors can't save it. I gave it 5 points because it's watchable but to be honest it doesn't worth your time. Sad. It's a missed opportunity. Spoiler coming:

500,ree-bee103,What's with the negative reviews?!?,10,20 May 2021,"Amazing film!!All the way through it walks the fine line of keeping us guessing - are the people in Anna's life real or are they delusions? My partner who is a doctor was convinced they were delusions from his experience with mental health patients. For example, Ethan's slightly unrealistic behaviour must be a delusion, surely? Why would a teenager come to see his boring agoraphobic neighbour? A child who is abused just SOMEHOW ends up in the apartment of a former child psychologist? And then his behaviour is so perfectly explained when the twist comes - he was acting that way because he knew she would ""like"" it as his next victim.The way the film paints mental illness is fantastic - the camera work is disorientating and really puts you in the shoes of the unreliable narrator. So many moments that had me feeling claustrophobic and uncomfortable. And Anna's coping mechanisms were very real. She is very aware of her illness but still cannot overcome it.And then the twist, which ends up making the whole ordeal that this woman goes through a triumph over her mental illness - I found that to be highly satisfying and a message of hope.Finally, Anna's characters herself is absolutely wonderful. Amazing acting by Amy Adams. Despite everything she has done in the past and everything she is going through, her moral compass is strong and her will is something to be reckoned with, even when she herself believes she is seeing visions. Mental illness is not glorified like it is in many similar films and used as a cheap plot device (eg Shutter Island), it is really honestly portrayed. The plot twist I thought was absolutely elegant and perfectly executed.I expected a thriller that would keep me guessing. I got that AND I was uplifted. Really great film. (Again, I simply don't understand the bad reviews).",The Woman in the Window

Oookay.Oh, let's make that tenant skeezy and on parole, so that he can be considered a suspect.Let's make the Oldman character really nasty for no good reason so that HE can be considered a suspect.Let's have Anna (supposedly a psychologist!) welcome the odd affection of a strange teen-aged boy that she's never met and has no background on.Let's have Anna own a professional-level camera that she JUST happens to have, unlike James Stewart in ""Rear Window"" whose character actually IS a professional photographer. And if she took pics on it, when and how did she upload them onto her computer? Hmmm?Let's have her drop the computer that has a key pic on it so that the screen shatters.Let's have the strong, angry teenager physically bested by a woman who's been weakened by alcohol, prescriptions, and mental incapacity.Let's have the whole damn mystery revealed in breathless dialogue in the last 20 minutes during which we've stopped caring altogether.Oh, and BTW--just throwing this in--the detective refers to Punch the cat as female, but at the end, Anna picks it up and says, ""Good boy.""I really like Amy Adams, Julianne Moore, and Gary Oldman. But how they got talked into this schlock is a mystery in itself (although kudos to Moore for spot-on characterization).Also--spare us the cutesy-ness of showing film clips from ""Rear Window"" and ""Laura"" (among others), movies that are referred to in plot, but far, far superior to this mess. No comparison. I highly recommend both.I'm not even sure that Brian de Palma could have done better with this. We certainly deserve better mysteries.

515,idahola,I really wanted this to be good,4,1 June 2021,"I love Hitchcockian thrillers, and this one is similar to Rear Window, but not nearly as good. While it seems to make an attempt at a sort of noirish psychological thriller inside of a home trap, it flings back and forth between a paranoid state and a morbid reality so often and joltingly that it feels more like the director is just trying to play mind tricks on you than threading a needle through Anna's cracking mind and reality. It could have been so much more, and with a such a well-known cast, and dialog that does thread well, I can only blame the director for such a clumsy presentation.Too often scenes that are building up and going somewhere suddenly jump into some bizarre scene or color change that feel forced and overwrought, making things confusing and sometimes silly. There's a lot of pretension in the delivery, and often it feels like the director is trying to hit you over the head with apparent twist setups or sub-dialog like ""oh but THIS is really what's happening!"" even when it's revealed that it wasn't, which isn't a deft way of handling mysteries. It's the kind of shallow setups and deliveries that seem to be made for over-simplification, as in not trusting the audience with nuance in apparent contradictions, which can result in characters contradicting who they are just for apparent or actual plot twists. It's annoying and overboard, and instead of feeling like layers of the onion are being peeled away, I often felt like I was being thrown around in a contrived carnival ride. It honestly felt like many of the teen-targeted haunted house movies, which is not something that works well with Hitchcockian thrillers.There were some good twists however, and some great surrealist imagery, but the greatest twists were marred by poor scene threading, and oversimplified character behavior early on, requiring the aforementioned character contradictions to ratchet in later twists and actions. I'll bet the book handles these things much better (whether it's a stolen story or not). The scene on the rooftop got ridiculous... I hope the book didn't involve a gardening claw, and if it did, I hope it was handled less like a B-movie shock device than the director treated it. Also there were some ridiculous camera angles and zooms throughout the whole movie that looked right out of a campy scream-queen flick... they were completely laughable in context with the rest of the cinematography. I was just completely blown away that Amy Adams and these other big names are now attached to these weird displays... I wonder if they ever expected that. I'm sorry if they didn't.It's really a B- movie scrambled up to a D+ that could have been an A+... it should be way better, but I think I have to completely blame the director on this one.

The look and feel of the apartment, the meeting with 'Jane', her drinking mixed with prescription medication and the effects on her sanity, and the way her agoraphobia was portrayed all looked how I imagined when I read the story.

Then the covid came and I had time enough to read the book and really loved it. The movie itself is not that bad. Has many good things in it that make it enjoyable but not a masterpiece. The main problem I have with it is that doesn't include many of the key points in the book.The movie is faithful to the novel but if you look closely many things are missing. I understand taking out the chat online with Lizzie (actually Ethan) but the movie doesn't explain that the accident Anna had was the reason for her agoraphobia and that she spent DAYS on the snow.In the book there are 5 main plot twists:
-Jane actually being alive
-Anna's family being dead all along
-""Jane"" being Ethan's real mother
-Ethan telling Anna it was Alistair who killed Jane
-And that Ethan was actually the killerThe movie is limited to take 3 of them and makes the final act not as shocking as the book one. From the beginning, Ethan looks very disturbed but not as he is supposed to. And Ethan manipulating Anna by the emails, the chats, and even by letting her watch him through the window, were the things that made it so surprising in the end.I could spend so much time talking about key points in the book that were omitted by the movie but I'm not gonna do that.Amy Adams is incredible but Julianne Moore, Gary Oldman, and, (especially) Jennifer Jason Leigh are very wasted. They are good actors but they just got very small roles and that's a shame.I think Tracy Letts was not the right choice to write the screenplay. He struggles to adapt his plays so to have him adapting a work from another person is (for me) a total mistake.As I said, the movie is not bad and I know it doesn't have to be exactly like the novel but, if it is an adaptation, why didn't the movie adapted the things that made the book so good?",The Woman in the Window

Instead, what I got was a perfectly enjoyable suspense thriller. Sure, it's has it's flaws, the first half seems rushed, and some actors were underutilized (Jennifer Jason Leigh in particular) but I did not see that final twist coming - a twist that actually made sense.I have not read the book, but even if I had it's only fair to judge this as a separate piece of work - because it is. So even if the book WAS better, it's got nothing to do with this piece of entertainment to me for they are two completely different experiences.

542,leightonmilton,Barely a thriller,3,16 May 2021,"Great cast with good acting but felt more like a theatre play and not having read the book but heard great things I assume the film would do it justice. Usually in thrillers there is a huge plot twist that you didn't see coming, yet she is a delusional woman who takes drugs to help with her phobia that causes hallucinations which explains why everything is the way it is in the first half so no real twists and this is said to you, the audience. This just becomes a dull affair as nothing really new happens, just the main character accusing people based on what she saw. So people not believing her and she starts to doubt herself, then she gives up. So where is the twist you ask, well all the stuff I mentioned before turns out she was right all along. Huge shocker and she gets attacked. After being hospitalised, an apology from the detective and some short time has passed her phobia is no longer a thing. She couldn't even leave her house before being viciously attacked but afterwards she is healed from all her trauma... Logic! She moves on with her life by moving out of her house.",The Woman in the Window

Did what was missing from the novel effect the enjoyability of the film? No. What was left out did not make the film difficult to understand. Nor did it decrease its entertainment value.

If you've read the book, you'll be disappointed and counting all the holes throughout the movie. If you haven't read the book, you'll just be confused and bored. I was so excited when I found out about the film adaptation, but 20mins in I just wanted to stop watching. Curiosity and hope made me continue on.The biggest twist was presented so poorly, it should've been so much more! Why did the detective apologise to Ana and say ""I'm sorry, your family is dead""? That took away so much impact. Ana already knew her family is dead, she didn't need to be notified. The purpose of that reveal was to snap Ana out of her delusions and confront her about her hallucinations ('talking' to her family) and inability to accept the truth about their death. She needed to be confronted about her ability to imagine things, and therefore she was imagining the whole incident with Jane Russell. But that all fell so flat. Ugh!So many aspects of the book were not even included in the movie. Bina, online chats with the 'granny'.. Understandably, not everything can be included, but you need to include the crucial parts to make the story what it is- a psychological thriller, not a drama/murder mystery. So many massive reveals were only mildly presented and that was just disappointing. All the way up until the ending- the way Ethan just appeared with a knife. The whole movie had no build up, it just rushed through to an over dramatic and unnecessarily gory ending.I regret watching it and don't recommend it at all.",The Woman in the Window

562,jasiegirl,Missed key points from the book!!!,5,14 May 2021,"I was SO looking forward to this movie, but was disappointed because many key points from the book were missing! I think that the things they left out would have clarified and explained a lot of the behaviors of Anna and Ethan. For example, they showed the car crash, but didn't talk about the fact that Anna was stranded for days in that storm, watching her family die (which was the cause of her agoraphobia and PTSD). We kind of saw Anna and Ethan's relationship, but it wasn't really believable. We weren't shown enough of their relationship to understand how Ethan manipulated Anna into trusting him and believing he was the victim. The movie also completely skimmed over the details of the guesswhoanna account, (how it was Ethan on Anna's computer but Anna, being under the influence of the meds and alcohol, thought that she had created and sent the emails to herself).... and the movie didn't even mention Anna's conversation with her online ""friend"" (who ended up actually being Ethan). Oh, and then there was Bina, Anna's friend..... I could go on and on.If they had included more details from the book, sure, the movie might have been longer, but it would have made more sense. It definitely would have been a LOT more intense and mind-blowing, like the book was.",The Woman in the Window

572,cb_homework,Interesting narrative but with poor execution,5,1 August 2021,"The Woman in the Window is a Crime Drama Mystery Thriller starring Amy Adams, Gary Oldman and Anthony Mackie and exclusively on Netflix. It is directed by Joe Wright and written by Tracy Letts and based on the novel by A. J Finn. The film in itself has an interesting concept, a woman with agoraphobia and her life living dealing with guilt, grief and a shocking murder, nobody believes she saw.Acting: The acting in this film is it's stand out, Amy Adams playing her lead role of Anna Fox is incredible. Since she is in basically every single scene meaning we see her the most, she keeps us interested and entertained even with a poorly executed plot. Gary Oldman puts on a great performance as always but nothing worthy to note on. Anthony Mackie has a decent performance; although it must be said he had little to work with. Wyatt Russell puts on possibly the second best performance, giving us a decent understanding of who his character is and their impatience with Amy Adams' character.Plot: The plot may be the most disappointing aspect of the film; that isn't saying it's a poor concept, but more so the poor execution. The concept in itself is interesting; a woman with agoraphobia who witnesses a murder from her window who struggles with an unconvinced detective as-well as her own personal struggles and regrets. This furthermore leads to an engaging story with its mysterious pull being the main drive in the films lacking narrative. The ending however, was lacklustre to say the least, with no spoilers, the reveal was rushed and confusing with no real justification of why the events occurred the way they did.VFX: There really isn't much to say with visual effects, nothing of note is used and nor is it necessary. But the cinematography done by cinematographer Bruno Delbonnel is quite good, we get excellent long shots of the main location of the film -Anna Fox's House.SFX and Music: Nothing to note on SFX but the Music done by composer Danny Elfman was great consistent with his standard.Overall: The Woman in the Window is a decent film with a run time of 100 minutes with great acting, a decent yet poorly executed plot and great music and cinematography. However, with its many wins it cannot climb anything above 5.4. It has an interesting pull but does not leave me with many emotions afterwards and feeling unsatisfied.The Woman in the Window - 5.4 = 5/10.",The Woman in the Window

The film just feels off and when the final twist arrives you're like ""that's it...?"". The last 10 minutes of the movie is literally spend on the main character leaving the house and taking a taxi.

I just can't see it. Despite its brilliant cast, I can't believe anybody would come into this films expecting anything other than some cheap thrills. It delivers that perfectly in my eyes.

I didn't want to spend ten minutes with any of these people, though Julianne Moore does the best job of being appealing in a truly disturbing way. Tracey Letts is a great writer. Her August: Osage County is a masterpiece. The dialogue in this movie is fresh and natural. Photography is properly moody without going goth nuts.

The bad taste in my mouth was that it announced it wanted to immitate (""pay homage"" to) Rear Window in the opening credits with a quick reference in the stills.The setup scenes and watching through binoculars across the street was a direct ripoff of Hitch's direction. It left me wanting Hitchcock to direct. It lost all credibiity with a clumsy plot device that Adam's character was a 'child psychologist'. She had no interpersonal insight and left the impression she'd learned nothing as she interacted with the her supervising psychiatrist. That script element stole any remaining credibility Adams would have had as an addict/manipulator. It was not her fault, she acted as directed and scripted.

However, it felt like ""Copycat"" with the writer suffering from agoraphobia and nothing better to do, so she enters a ""Rear Window"" phase and spies on the neighbors.There's a ""whodunit"" aspect of the story that sort of remains constant throughout the film, but there's not enough substance for viewers or even Amy's character to really point fingers. There wasn't a solid understanding of how Amy's character leaned into isolation, or guilt and shame and how it led to agoraphobia. It just seemed like she swore off going outside and became an alcoholic cat lady, because of what happened to her family. Her career wasn't believable either, to be honest. She was never given a moment to show she had control over herself as a person and professional. It felt like she had no real agency and her therapist even felt aloof and dismissive of her. That alone made her decisions as a character seem a little justified and rational because who actually listened to understand her besides the woman from across the street?Also, for a good portion of the third act, she shows no realistic concern for her missing/hurt cat and doesn't suspect or accuse anyone of doing harm to it, when the opportunity was there to advance her suspicions. That could have led to more development.The characters felt sort of incomplete and that may be because this is a book adaptation and it can't all be there, but the only person who was sort of established was the tenant downstairs and he wasn't even a threat to her. All of the actors (cat included) did what they could, but this wasn't the suspense thriller it was marketed to be. It looked good though.",The Woman in the Window

By the end of the film we were in stitches, laughing out loud at scene after scene of these hilariously over the top scenarios, faux artistic shots, comical over-acting/sobbing/hyperventalating from Amy and plot holes galore. Not gonna lie, this movie is so so so bad.I have no idea how a movie like this got made or why someone like Amy Adams would feel this was a necessary step in her career.I honestly feel that this movie will become one of those movies people get stoned and watch to laugh at. It's so ridiculously terrible in every possible way which I could judge a movie that you can't help but admire what a train wreck it is.Not sure whether to rank this 2/10 or 8/10.

Nonetheless, the story clearly dragged on for too long -- I felt it would have been essential to reveal the backstories of other supporting actors and their character's motives to strengthen the plot.The Production, however, in terms of crafting the home that Anna, (played by Amy Adams) lived in was the best I have ever seen. The entire ""three story home"" was a set designed for the movie. There were beautifully-textured walls, arches and other architectural details, in addition to the use of lighting (sunlight passing through the curtains) that made the atmosphere of the movie feel so alluring, and captivating.

Parts of this book actually scared me and gave me chills. When I heard it was being turned into a movie, I was beyond thrilled! I anxiously awaited the release.Now if you did not read the book beforehand, you might enjoy the movie. My fiancé didn't read the book and liked the movie, but he also mentioned some plot holes in the movie.Since I read the book, I prepared myself for the scenes that raised the hairs on my arm. The part in the book where Anna awakes to hear an intruder in her house, breaking glass. This intruder then calls her name and says he's been waiting for her. It turns out to be Ethan's dad but that part of the story freaked me out. And the biggest plot twist when it was revealed to be Ethan all along and how he's been watching her while she sleeps. The part in the book where she wakes up and says out loud to her cat ""But how did he know about your hurt paw?"" And then Ethan says ""Because I've been watching you sleep."" My heart was sent RACING during that part of the book. I could not wait for that scene to unfold...but when it did, it was the most mediocre reveal. The whole video suicide-will? And then Ethan killing David? I was so confused and then so disappointed. The fight scene was okay. When she kicks him, we actually laughed out loud.I know a movie can't contain everything in the book. But when you take out major parts of the plot (the online ""friend"" or when she sees those emailed photos of her in her camera roll), it just ruins what could've been a phenomenal movie.",The Woman in the Window

677,CatM-,A really great murder mystery thriller! A Modern Hitchcock Tone & Vibe of the Movie & Amazing Acting! Especially By The Amazing Amy Adam's!,10,29 June 2021,I really liked this movie & the acting in the movie by all the Actors was amazing. Especially by Amy Adam's! She really captured so unbelievablely authenticly what it must & would feel like to be a recluse with Agoraphobia. And how dibilatating of disorder it is for the millions of people who suffer from it. Such as the stories you hear of people not leaving the house for 20 yrs before treatment not even to go across the street. (Spoiler alert stop reading here.)When Amy Adam's Character tries to leave out the front door of her Two flat Apartment she goes into a dangerous panic attack so bad bad it literally puts the audience into life as an untreated Agoraphobic. The movie itself is awesome 5 star thriller by far top 5 of Netflix movies any genre for 2020 and 2021. I was entertained & on the edge of my seat. Great acting by Julian Moore & new commer her neighborhoor the Teenage boy/young adult Son of Julian Moore The movie is based around. Very modem take on Hitchcock type vibe as well. I usually can guess just about any movie thrillers ending but this one was a total shock to me. The ending was the best part.A tip for those who have not seen the Movie yet is to watch the Movie at night.Because it is a dark & or the film it is shot very dark & almost entirely at night which gives it a cool scarier edge.Not a movie to watch in a bright room on a sunny day.Must watch in a dim/dark room & or at night & even better for the feeling of it for it to be raining out or pouring rain like a thunderstorm.I tried watching it the first time on a sunny afternoon In the middle of the day & turned off after 2 minutes & watched the same night during a Thunderstorm with the sounds of thunder & pouring rain on my windows much like it was a large portion of the movie & I loved it from beginning to End. Had I watched it the same Afternoon when sunny it would have been to hard to see it & I could never have gotten into the story line or movie. ( I haven't read the book as of yet but it is on my top 3 must read for this summer.)Anyway my tip is watch this movie in a dark room and or at night and if you watch it in a bright room or during the day make sure you have read the book first or you will have no idea what is going on because it will be hard to view the very dark movie.,The Woman in the Window

From its Hitchcock-ian Rear Window allegory to its pacing, and direction, this film comes across as simply trying way too hard to be so many things at once. Unlike Rear Window and even Disturbia, TWITW plays hard and fast with the facts, dialogue and editing in the hopes that you won't see it's glaring flaws.When Hitchcock told the story using the lens of a camera and diegetic sound, he provided his audience with cutlery to consume the film at their own pace. TWITW, however, spends two thirds of its runtime playing ""here comes the aeroplane"" with its audience, feeding them exposition-laden dialogue wrapped in a murder mystery, hidden behind psychological plot holes.",The Woman in the Window

The first 3/4 of this film are extremely compelling, beautifully shot, and brilliantly acted. I was on the edge of my seat from the start, trying to figure out the psyche of the main character and how it related to what we were watching. Much of it was trying to determine if we were being fooled by a delusion, or if what we were seeing was truly reality. I loved the midpoint twist and got heavy ""Shutter Island"" vibes, but then that vibe completely changed when the next twist comes. The last 15 minutes, the ultimate ""climax"" of the film, was a compete disappointment. I could not believe how lame the ending was. It literally feels like the movie was directed by one person, until the last 15 minutes being directed by someone completely different. Maybe the book does it better, I don't know.

The pacing is egregious and poorly done. I remember the plot of the book very well and they followed for the first half, then it felt as if the rug was pulled out from you. Way too fast. They should have done this film into a tv series. It would have been better to flesh out the plot and characters. The acting is very good and convincing but I was disappointed because Joe Wright is a phenomenal director and he failed at adapting this book into a heart-pounding thriller.The book was going to be very hard to adapt.

701,billybaumeister1234,Underwhelming Bland Adaptation of Thrilling Best-Selling Novel,7,14 May 2021,"I read this book back in April of 2017 when I was a sophomore in high school and I was so invested in the characters, story, twists. I am a 19 year old male who loves psychological thrillers so this story was right up my alley. I read the book after reading ""Big Little Lies"" which continued my saga of excellent twisty mysteries. The minute I saw the trailer, I had a feeling it wouldn't be amazing but maybe will still be a great thriller. I'm very underwhelmed with the finished product.The film feels like an abridged version of the book, making the entire story so rushed that you don't have enough time to care about any of the characters. They are all so underdeveloped which is a tragedy because I was left not caring about any of the characters including the main character. That is the problem. Dr. Anna Fox was just a mess rather than someone the audience can somewhat relate to, she's almost laughable in the film. It wasn't Amy Adam's fault at all, it was the way her character was barely fleshed out. She was just a paranoid agoraphobic mess of a woman which the book expressed but with even more of a humane and understanding touch so the audience can feel something for her for the right reasons. The characters were too one dimensional, leaving the superb cast with not much to play with.It wasn't that the film was a bore, it was such a try-hard to be suspenseful. The director relied heavily on the look of the film which in this case, didn't end up winning me over like ""Atonement"" did. I am quite stunned at how this wasn't an HBO or Netflix television show. A limited series that included more scenes from the book for character development would've helped a ton. The film got rid of so many plot points from the book that would've made Anna a lot more likeable and all the characters way more interesting. All the characters were bland pieces of cardboard with a tiny sprig of lavender on top.I was entertained by the forgettable film which is not what I was hoping for. The book left a mark on me with how exciting and juicy it was while the film felt way too energetic, resulting in missing the biggest punchlines psychological thrillers offer. I could a sense of ""let's get this over with"" with how the story was told.I would recommend people read and stick to the phenomenal book. The film is a Sparknotes for those who don't care for this kind of material. But if you like this genre, by all means, don't watch this disappointing adaptation, hoping for the next ""Rear Window"" meets ""Gone Girl"" level of brilliance. It's more ""The Girl on the Train"" meets ""Sharp Objects"". It had ""The Girl on the Train"" level of careless forgettable underwhelming drama and the slower pace of the excellently adapted ""Sharp Objects"" which was an HBO limited series starred also, by the talented and beautiful Amy Adams. I'm giving the film a 7 because of the cast who did the best they could with the mediocre and bland material they received. I'm not saying it's horrible but it's also not amazing so do with what you will with that information.",The Woman in the Window

If I hadn't read the book, I'm sure the film would have been fine and stood well on its own legs, but I can't help but feel a bit underwhelmed by the film adaptation's storytelling compared to that of A. J. Finn's novel, one of my favorite thrillers I've read recently. While the performances are fine, Amy Adams' being the best, the film left me with questions that would have been unanswered if not for the book. Or, if not unanswered, at least not explained as effectively as in the novel. While the film is relatively close to the source material, there are some subtle differences that end up dulling the movie down a bit. The motivations of certain characters remain gray at the end of the film, while the book fleshes out these motivations and intentions much more thoroughly. While I understand that things are always lost in translation from a book to film adaptation, it felt like the writers and director could have focused more on the development of the story and the explanation of characters and their motivations more intently. My advice: read the book before seeing the movie! It's a fantastic thriller. The book is slow and suspenseful and creaking, while the movie is more of a rapidly paced synopsis. Or watch the movie and appreciate it as its own separate entity.",The Woman in the Window

712,biancolina-08606,Some great elements but the script was lacking,7,22 May 2021,"This film has a great concept. The protagonist, Amy Adams, plays her character excellently and a lot is intriguing about her characterization in general - her being an agoraphobic child psychologist who is not working, the fact that her condition is bad enough that she sees another psychologist regularly and has him on speed dial, the fact that her attractive tenant goes out of his way to do things for her. I thought he had worked something out with her husband but that's not the case. She ""speaks with her husband"" regularly and he is supportive. We figure out later that this isn't the reality. We wonder why her family isn't with her. There's a great set up for a great movie. Right away, I was drawn in. Once the boy across the street comes, Ethan, with a candle in the rain, I knew he was an antagonist and hiding something. There is no way this was a major twist. No teen is that interested in having a conversation with a shut in, I doubt he found her attractive considering the circumstances, and that he was so curious about her seemed unrealistic. No, he was setting something up clearly. Then when ""Jane"" (Julianne Moore) came into the picture, I thought this whole thing was a set up. Why would she be so curious about Anna Fox, for no reason? After watching the movie there is absolutely no explanation about why she would ever want to visit the woman. Then, why does Mr. Russell ask if his wife had been there? Did he know she was pretending to be his wife Jane Russell? Makes no sense! So many holes! Such a good set up for a let down. David downstairs from Massachusetts? It's too convenient. There is no reason for it except for convenience. Then, why was ""Jane"" across the street, in the house, for so long? Unrealistic. Why wouldn't she tell Anna the truth about who she is? Again, there really is no reason to hide the truth and someone looking for compassion wouldn't pretend to be someone else's wife when she wasn't, especially because Anna could easily see the next day another woman there and find out the truth. And, ""Jane"" randomly has an affair with David while staying across the street to make amends with her son? And became obsessed with David? Again, there is no set up for this and it makes little sense. The fact that Ethan is really the bad guy is interesting but so much more could have been done with it. The end with the detectives and with everyone confessing was too easy and convenient. It was as if a whole act of the movie was skipped. Also, why would Ethan, after all these years, never harm the real Jane? And, why did he bother with his father's assistant? No real explanation. Another thing, why was his father abusive? He doesn't get a pass for that. So many unanswered questions and set up fails. The writer either rushed this or they just think people will watch whatever and get lazy.

I can definitely say I was not disappointed! I think that not having read the book is what made the movie enjoyable for me. I didn't expect the plot twists and had nothing to compare the movie to. Would have loved to see it be a bit longer and have some more focus on secondary characters, but overall I think the story got well wrapped up.",The Woman in the Window
728,konik-18490,Overall it was a good film,8,21 May 2021,Even though I am a usual film lover not knowing a lot about movies and just starting with the reviews o have to say that I enjoyed that movie. I know that everyone is saying that the book is better and that the Rear Window of Hitchcock is a much superior film with pretty much the same purpose but from my point of view without having any of this knowledge prior to visiting the actual IMDB page of the movie I have to say that I was surprised by the casting and the plot of The woman in the window. First of all I would say that the film was pretty standard and mild at the beginning. It was just a curious little nosy woman who was spying at her neighbor's houses because as it was made very clear she had agoraphobia so the audience normally was lead to the conclusion that she basically had no life. When the second character is introduce to the film you get the feeling that the woman has a different more motherly side to her and you are intrigued about her personality and maybe her backstory since the nosy woman from before did not match the caracter that you see talking to that scared peculiar boy that comes to visit. After that the film introduces the audience to the element of insanity of the main lead revealing her back story and making the audience to sympathize with her but not saying the entire truth. When the reveal of her dead family comes to surface then the action starts and I can honestly say that I enjoyed watching a good traditional chasing scene among the two main characters. The chase for her life made me agonies and want to see more .is she gonna commit suicide or she hasn't lost her faith in herself yet?It is a really good movie full of great directing shots and tequinics that plays with the audiences mind just at the right level to keep it at the edge of their sits but not so good and rightfully not so good to the people that have experienced the plot via a much more detailed narration through a book.Over all I enjoyed the screenplay and the acting from every character in this movie . Amy Adams made me shiver and I have to say that I pretty much loved her and her way of delivering the character.I would recommend to a sceptical about horror movies friend. :),The Woman in the Window
729,manolalovro,If a copy of Rear Window went really bad.,4,16 May 2021,"Loving a good told thriller, I gave a chance to 'The Woman in the Window'. It was a bad idea. If you usually like thrillers and watched Rear Window there is no way you will like this movie. Go watch 'Disturbia' instead if you want watching a thriller similar to Rear Window. Too many mistakes in the movie, both factual and story wise. The protagonist isn't someone yoy are gonna connect to and isn't likeable at all.

733,poemadeldia,"""The crashed car in the next room""",10,19 May 2021,"I just watched the movie for the second time because I really liked Bruno Delbonnel's cinematography. This master of color and light has already left masterful marks in Amelie (2001), Across the Universe (2007) and Darkest Hour (2017), the latter also directed by Joe Wright.In my opinion, the references to Hitchcock that Wright makes are a way of asking permission to develop that route, and incidentally leave a tribute to the master of suspense.Amy Adams plays a woman who suffers from Agoraphobia, and since she is locked in her house, due to anxiety problems, she connects with the world through what she sees from her windows, mixes it with her memories, with glasses of wine and with classic movie clips that she usually watch more than once, because she know the lines so well. Her role is complex and delicate, and Amy handles it very well.For me, movies are made of details. It is the details that make it possible for us to connect, for an emotional reaction to occur in us, the viewers.One detail I like is when, in the middle of a dramatic scene that escalates into suspense, there are broken images from the movie ""Dark Passage"", a 1947 classic shot in San Francisco, where an ex-convict changes his face in order to prove his innocence. That detail works because the image and the text of that moment creates an atmosphere of danger, revealing that something is changing. There are other classics that appear fleetingly on the screen, ""Spellbound"" and ""Laura"", which are psychological dramas, fascinating theatrical performance, and in my opinion, it is another way in which the director connects Anna with the world she is creating around it, which is theatrical.But my favorite moment is when everything seems to be suspended and silent, the air changes its rhythm and color, the lights go out and only Anna's face remains illuminated. It makes me feel like I'm in a theater, actually seeing the actors on stage. It's fascinating because suddenly Amy Adams enters a monologue that little by little reveals to us the true situation of her mental state. The voices of others take her time and her place to explain to her what is really going on. It is the unveiling of the reality that she does not want to accept, And the culmination of the moment is visually brilliant: The crashed car in the next room = total awesomeness.There will always be a difference of opinion among those of us who write about movies, it is about different tastes, different ways of seeing the same thing, and that is something appreciable, although sometimes there are people who write with their liver in hand. I try to be honest with what I feel, and the way a movie affects me, it tells me things visually and soundly, and The Woman in the Window tells me a lot. Amy Adams should be nominated for an Academy Award, as should Julianne Moore, who has a short but spectacular appearance, Kevin Thompson for production design, and of course Maestro Bruno Delbonnel for cinematography.",The Woman in the Window

I was very excited for this movie when I heard that it was being picked up and with Amy Adams no less. Though she gave a good performance, this movie was off. The pacing was very strange, the tone was odd, it lacked the mystery of the book, and it didn't have great explanation of most of the story. You didn't feel anything about the characters or the story in general. Because of this there was no general pay-off at the end. They also changed some events of the story that I didn't feel were necessary at all. Some odd cinematography as well.

I have not read the book while my wife had, and we were both equally frustrated by the movie. It seems the agoraphobia of the character is an afterthought when I thought it would be a main factor. It seems the subject material would be effective when carried out properly. It really just felt flat and the ending was filmed very awkwardly and not in an effectively thriller fashion. From a director that made pride and prejudice and atonement (both great movies) i'm shocked this all felt shoddy and thrown together. Very weird, and very disappointing.",The Woman in the Window

The critics didn't like it being pasty and jolty. I would have chosen different music for different scenes. The ending needed more wrap around closure re: Katie with a scene of Alistair confessing - maybe coming in during the fight scene in the rain with Jane Russell calling the cops arriving in time to see what really happened. It was too truncated with the hospital scene. Didn't think the music matched. Nevertheless, I disagree with the critics and really liked all the actors.",The Woman in the Window

It's absolutely laughable and it totally breaks the little bit of immersion that the movie manages to create.The film is slow and boring, with bits of ""better"" plot sequences.

They clearly did not read the book or watch the trailer to see the style the movie was taking before watching.Personally I loved the style of the film, the colour pallette and the set. It absolutely lived up to the book in my opinion- it's completely unrealistic to expect every detail from a novel to be included in a 2 hour film, anything that was left out did not effect the storyline.The performances were great all round, the only negative I can say is that there weren't enough scenes/screen time with the side characters- however this may be down to the extensive reshoots and reworking the film went through.I loved the ending, it really gave the feeling of a classic horror/thriller but through a more modern lense.I highly recommend this movie, think people are being unreasonably harsh and bitter.",The Woman in the Window

Then today randomly when I was going through the reviews and ratings of the film, I am finding all these bad reviews. Well trust me many things are made up in this business, so please watch a movie yourself and then decide. Its a good movie and has a tricky plot. I liked the direction and obviously Amy Adams did a great job. Its exactly how a good thriller film is suppose to be, you can't expect all films to be realistic.

I'm therefore not a fan of a director trying to so blatantly and unapologetically mirror his style. No, the movie is not unwatchable but it ends up being laughable when you shouldn't be laughing. The villain may as well have been twirling the curly ends of a moustache while saying "" nyah hah hah"". You figure most of it out before it even ends and meanwhile you're scratching your head at the actions of the characters. Particularly the police. I'm surprised the female officer didn't just take out her taser and tase Amy Adams character just because she had one and it's available. And early on you immediately knew how the villain would die. They pretty much told you as much way before it happened. A lot of things are said or implied and if you're thinking it while you're watching it no doubt you're gonna be right. Still. It's entertaining to a certain extent and not a complete waste of time. I think at one point the actors involved said screw this and were thisclose to going over the top. Watch it. You won't want to turn it off. But it will get somewhat annoying.",The Woman in the Window

The only thing i liked about this movie was Punch (aka the star of the movie) and Amy & Juliannes acting. The rest is garbage. Everything about this movie is so cliche and it feels like a parody of trying to be a stylistic thriller. This movie seems just so unrealistic, the way people act. The whole cliche of being mentally ill and people saying you are crazy or making up things is just so over used in films, its not releastic anymore, pls stop using it. There is so many plot holes too that makes this movie confusing. No character development. Gary Oldmans acting was bad. The effects on the scene where Juliannes character dies was just so bad.

812,acmavk,"Good, liked cinematography",7,15 June 2021,"In terms of the story line I think it was good but what really caught my attention was the cinematography especially during the times she is taking her pill.Although the actual pill taking has little to do with the storyline as such, instead just with character development/her character, I really think the director used cinematography in an incredible way to show the influence of the pill during it´s use.It is extremely interesting to see how the ""trip"" actually takes place, it is extremely well filmed. Especially one scene where she turns on the tap of water to take a pill but the whole journey there is actually just a big confusion and she ends up at the tap and just thinks she is there to take another pill so she does, at least that is how I understood it. And I think the way the filming is done in that specific scene is incredible because it really hits close to home with how sleeping pills/anti-anxiety pills that are very strong, such as benzos and barbis confuse your mind and control you if you don't understand their effects and aren't consciously experiencing them.For me this movie´s side story of drug use and a pill that isn´t correctly dosed is at least if not more interesting than the actual storyline, as the camerawork and the way she goes back to other scenes during drug use etc is extremely well connected to actual effects of drug etc.In terms of the movie as such, as I say I do like the story but not incredible I'd say and the ending scene I think should have deserved a bit more budget just because there are some parts that I think are very fake looking etc.",The Woman in the Window

If you're bored one night, it's worth a watch for the few high-profile celebrities, couple of truly rewarding laughs, and twist ending. Otherwise I'd recommend steering clear.",The Woman in the Window
873,kittyskye,Just say you hate neurodiverse people,1,17 May 2021,"I haven't read the book, but in the film, Ethan came off as clearly autistic-coded and until the end, I was extremely excited they didn't go with the classic horror trope that autistic people are murderers, terrible people, etc. Until the end.The film was shot strangely, the acting was not great, and the autistic-coded character as the murderer was the worst. I get going for the ""people should believe women,"" but why at the expense of neuroatypical people? I am sure the book may not be ableist and based off reviews, more like he is playing her so he can seem innocent, but instead in the film we see a seemingly normal neurodiverse kid become a murderer. Gross, overplayed, and unoriginal.If it wasn't for that part, maybe it would be a 5/10, but instead it is garbage.",The Woman in the Window
874,jkrissie-13533,Almost as good as novel. Even with changes,8,19 May 2021,I liked the movie almost better than the book! The book has long drawn out parts that I skimmed through until the shocking twist at the end. Then I went back and read again. Found some clues when I reread but still skimmed many pages. I felt like I'd seen this movie already (even checked release date) which I think is good when a movie is made from a novel. Some of the plot was changed but still good. I think shock factor was much better in the novel.,The Woman in the Window
875,dinopavicc,Ok film for the evening,7,11 September 2021,"I'm writing this only because the film has lower rating then it should have which is weird for IMDb.I enjoyed it as an evening thriller, yes there are some holes in writing but directing is decent, music not so much as it is revealing too much up front.All in all 7, I watched it to the end which is a success for the random film picking.",The Woman in the Window
