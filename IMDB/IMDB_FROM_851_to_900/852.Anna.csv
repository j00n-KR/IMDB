0,Leofwine_draca,Had potential,5,21 February 2020,"Luc Besson's latest thriller is a big step up from that lame CGI fest sci-fi movie he made which I won't even bother naming. However, compared to the director's classics of old this is slim pickings indeed, and even compared to modern material like RED SPARROW (with which it shares many similarities) it's not particularly good. Besson's direction remains entertaining but he wrote this one too and it does get very convoluted as time goes on; the constant jumping back and forth in time is excessive and distracting, and the running time is around half an hour too long too. The ending in particular goes down the 'one twist after another' route and becomes particularly tedious and ridiculous in equal measure. However, it's not all bad. The photogenic lead actress gives a solid turn, well supported by seasoned hands including Luke Evans, Cillian Murphy and Helen Mirren; there's plenty of style; the spy material is always interesting at the very least, and Besson stages a single lengthy and exemplary set-piece in a restaurant which draws in slick choreography, JOHN WICK-style martial arts and plentiful shooting into a satisfying whole. A shame there wasn't more like that and less of the clever-clever, slightly tedious plotting throughout.",Anna
1,SnoopyStyle,Nikita again,6,17 September 2019,"In 1985 Moscow, CIA agent Lenny Miller (Cillian Murphy) loses nine operatives to KGB chief Vassiliev. Years later, Anna (Sasha Luss) is struggling in life and signs up for the Russian Navy. KGB agent Alex Tchenkov (Luke Evans) recruits her to be an assassin under the supervision of Olga (Helen Mirren).It's another hot assassin movie from Luc Besson. La femme Nikita is almost 30 years ago. He's like an old painter who keeps returning to the same style over and over again. He's trying something a little grittier and a little more real. It's not his lane. His lane is hot girl doing wild actions with simplistic story. He tries to add layers to the story. At last, he's no Graham Greene which brings to mind the acting skills of model-turned-actor Sasha Luss. She tries and the character is essentially her without the killings. She's surprisingly functional but she's no Meryl Streep. Finally, I would try to clean up the constant time-jumps in the plot. They are supposed to be shocking reveals but they mostly confuse and are unnecessary. If he does a straight forward timeline, the movie may actually gain some tension of wondering if anybody can be trusted. He's probably not capable of doing the truly gritty espionage movie. Somebody should do a film retrospective of his hot female assassin movies.",Anna
2,nogodnomasters,We all have turning points in our life,7,1 July 2019,"Anna (Sasha Luss) is a Russian Fashion model, working in Paris. 17 minutes into the film we have our first WTF moment followed by the first of many flashbacks so that we know how clever the writers are. The film is high-speed Russian assassinations, none of which involve radioactive polonium. Anna does what she must to survive, but is no Jennifer Lawrence. The film has a number of twists and turns.Guide: F-word. Sex. Nudity (Sasha Luss). Helen Mirren playing a Russian.",Anna
3,kosmasp,Not a riddle,7,19 August 2019,"Having a female lead that incorporates strength, power, sexy and style was paramount. And because they found one, this works quite nicely. Of course having Helen Mirren and the other actors to support her and the story helps too. But let's keep it real, this is a thriller that does not care much about making sense or being coherent.It does care about exciting the viewer and in that it succeeds. Action, stunts and thrill are all there, with quite a few twists and turns to help giving this a boost. This is quite the interesting movie but not one that will work your brain too much, it's a movie that will speak to anyones instincts - and those will be not just engaged and in a very satisfactory fashion",Anna
4,classicsoncall,"""Trouble never sends a warning.""",7,11 August 2020,"Well, I was pretty harsh in my reviews of ""Leon:The Professional"" and ""La Femme Nikita"" for different reasons, both by director Luc Besson. I find myself pretty much in the same position here. Not that this isn't a slick and stylish espionage thriller, but the action sequences defy all manner of credibility, making even John Wick a piker relative to body count when all the dust settles. I guess that's what one expects when going into a flick like this, but after a while it gets almost comical. The chronologically challenged time frames also don't help, and I can't say they were totally necessary to tell an effective story. What they provide are the unexpected twists involved in turning an assassin into a double agent, and then a triple agent, and I guess you could have gone on and on in that manner if the picture wanted to. There's also that slick use of a body double to mimic Anna (Sasha Luss) in some of the tighter spots she found herself in. With lowered expectations, this might fill the bill for action fans, but leave your thinking cap in the closet.",Anna
5,lee_eisenberg,the US and USSR play each other off,6,4 March 2020,"For me, what was coolest about Luc Besson's ""Anna"" was how the protagonist got used by both sides against each other. True, the highlights are the action scenes, but how often do we get to see the story of someone who's both a KGB asset and CIA asset?Between this and the RED movies, Helen Mirren does well in action flicks.",Anna

7,view_and_review,Pizza and Ice Cream,4,1 July 2019,"In 2017, there was Atomic Blond. In 2018, there was Red Sparrow. 2019 brings you Anna. Anna was essentially a blend of Atomic Blond and Red Sparrow with a heavier dose of Red Sparrow.Mixing two good things together doesn't guarantee a better concoction. I like pizza and I like ice cream--mixing the two together doesn't yield a tastier food. In fact, it'd be a disaster. Anna was pizza and ice cream together.Like Atomic Blond, Anna was blond (easy), slept with a foreign woman, and she could handle herself in a fight. Truthfully, she was better than Atomic Blond, she was more like a blond female version of John Wick. She took on dozens of well-trained men. Lorraine (Atomic Blond) fought two, maybe three guys at a time.Listen, Anna could be the strongest 6 foot, 135 pound woman in the world: she's still 135 pounds. 135 pounds of muscle just doesn't add up to give her the strength to do what she was doing. But this is Hollywood so belief suspended.Like Red Sparrow, Anna was Russian, worked for the KGB out of force, got mixed up with the CIA, and wanted out.What Anna lacked that the two aforementioned movies had was uniqueness. Anna was a worse version of both, especially Red Sparrow.You want to know what the real point of the movie was? Men suck.The KGB was run by a dictatorial male. Anna's first KGB handler was a male. Anna's CIA handler was a male. She undid all of them mainly with her beauty and feminine wiles. Basically, both organizations are horribly represented in this movie because they can both be compromised by a beautiful woman. She was sexing up both her handlers which gave her access to things she wouldn't ordinarily be able to access. If it weren't for these horny, uber-masculine men then this would never have happened.But, from the beginning it was about male shortcomings. Her boyfriend was a loser that abused her. The photographers in all her photo shoots were bossy demanding men (one she had to beat up because he took a phone call while telling her to hold her pose. Surely, he deserved it?). Every target she had was some man that was doing something illegal and was vulnerable because of his lust. Then there were the handlers. It was like all (straight) men will be brought down by their penis.Anna, in the end was the smartest and the strongest. She was able to one up them all: the KGB, the CIA, and the KGB again. It's all very fairy tale and nothing unique.",Anna
8,neil-476,"If you're looking for originality, you won't find it here",7,10 July 2019,"The beautiful Anna is rescued from a seedy boyfriend and a future of petty crime by the KGB, who deck her out as a model and put her to work as an assassin. But Anna wants out - could the CIA provide her with an exit route?If the story sounds familiar, that's because it is - Nikita, anyone? As an action/suspense thriller, Anna is fine, if unoriginal. It is a simple story, needlessly complicated by unnecessary and confusing flashbacks - Five Years Ago, Two weeks Ago, Three Years ago... only a couple of these flashbacks actually need to be flashbacks in that they contain a payoff which would spoil a chronologically subsequent moment.Newcomer Sasha Luss is decorative, deals well with the action, and shoots more people than John Wick. The rest of the cast are reliable, although Luke Evans has an air of feeling miscast.",Anna
9,morrison-dylan-fan,Annabelle.,7,9 July 2019,"Getting back from seeing Toy Story 4 over the weekend with friends,I left YouTube on whilst doing bits round the house. Finding his dips into the fantastical and Cinéma du look cool with The Fifth Element, Angel-A and Nikita, (1990,1997 and 2005-all also reviewed) to be wonderfully creative, I was surprised to find a trailer playing for a upcoming movie from auteur film maker Luc Besson,which led to me meeting Anna.View on the film:Targeting Euro Spy thrills,writer/directing auteur Luc Besson & regular cinematographer Thierry Arbogast take the icy cool colours of Nikita, and burn them into washed whites and bleeding reds, reflecting the drained state of the Soviet Union's final days. Whilst flawed in the technology used for the late 80's/1990 (from Wi-Fi and Memory Sticks to high-speed internet!) Besson overcomes these bumps, in continuing a long time collaboration editor with Julien Rey, Besson loads up the stylisation of Cinéma du look in gripping Action set-pieces, struck by the blunt force gun shots and hand combat being met with slick edits, closing in for bruising close-ups of Anna's battle warrior face.Spying from the late 80's-1990,the screenplay by Besson needlessly complicates things with large jumps back and forth in time, which gets in the way of the nifty twist and turns from playing out Anna's major assassination missions from different perspectives. Loading up right back from Nikita, Besson vividly brings out the themes that run across his credits in the characterization of the disenfranchised, battered and bruised loner Anna, who Besson has intensely entrap all,as Anna finds her inner strength in the spying game. Sent out by Helen Mirren's dead-pan wit KGB head Olga, sexy Sasha Luss peels into the anguish of the spy, which Luss twists into deadly sass as Anna.",Anna
10,phd_travel,Clever story and entertaining action,10,4 October 2019,"Everything you love about Luc Besson movies you get here plus more. A sympathetic heroine played by Sasha Luss as the Russian model assassin. Glamorous locations. Comic and original fight sequences and hilarious love scenes.Brilliant story with a multiple forwards and back structure that actually works. It's quite an achievement that the complex and yet original story with the flashbacks and twists makes sense, comes together, is feel good and leaves no plot holes. As a bonus I really love the tribute to ""Assassin / Point of No Return"" with the getting freedom thing. All that with a sense of humor as well and one liners.Why else would such a top notch supporting cast including Cillian Murphy as a CIA agent, Luke Evans as a KGB agent and Helen Mirren really hams it up as a KGB senior agent.A must watch for Luc Besson fans. Besson is back!",Anna

12,deloudelouvain,Another typical Luc Besson action movie.,8,3 July 2020,"With this movie it isn't too difficult to make up your mind before watching it. If you don't like the style of Luc Besson then you should just skip this movie because that's exactly what you're going to get. If you don't like flamboyant action scenes, the ones where one woman defeats fourty guys, then just skip it. But if you do like Besson's style then this is going to be right up your alley. The action scenes are yes exaggerated but very well shot and choreographed. The cinematography is top notch, like we're used of him. The cast is well chosen, all actors did a great job and all add something to the story. It's an entertaining spy story, nothing to be taken too seriously, just easy entertainment from beginning till end, no dull moments, just a well written action movie, classic Luc Besson.",Anna
13,siderite,"On its own, average, but coming from Besson, awful",6,24 September 2019,"Besson seems to be fixated on this story of the super sexy killer female spy. Anna is the rehash of Nikita, with only minor changes and a lot less style. It's basically the Ocean 11 version of the original, with less realism and cruelty and a higher body count. Just watch the 1990 movie and forget about this. I know everything gets remade after 30 years, but who the hell remakes their own movies?The acting was good, the action scenes were solid, Sasha Luss was beautiful, but I would have much preferred a Rocky/Rambo style sequel with Anne Parillaud than this crap of a film.",Anna
14,FeastMode,surprising and pretty awesome,7,9 November 2019,"I had a great time with this movie. it was suspenseful and pretty crazy, with a few BEASTLY action scenes. the movie overall isn't as clean or neat as it could be, but my love for the lead character makes up for a lot of it. i was very entertained (1 viewing 11/8/19)",Anna
15,Pjtaylor-96-138044,La Femme Atomic Sparrow,5,6 July 2019,"Essentially, 'Anna (2019)' is a clear-cut combination of a few different movies: 'Nikita (1990)', 'Atomic Blonde (2017)' and 'Red Sparrow (2018)' - with a little bit of the 'John Wick (2015)' and 'The Bourne Identity (2002)' series thrown in there, for good measure. Perhaps because it wears its influences on its sleeve, it just comes across as a pale imitation of them. Interestingly, the few movies it's inspired by the most pretty much all have this problem, too. The piece plays out as, ostensibly, a post cold-war cold-war espionage thriller with the occasional bit of fairly out-of-place but decently executed - if a tad 'trailer-like' - 'gun-fu' and a few 'people in suits watching CCTV' scenes shot with a Greengrass-esque handheld style. In concept, I suppose, it doesn't sound like a bad idea. The issue is that none of its elements really mesh all that well and they're all quite derivative, to boot. I guess its biggest departure from the formula is its non-linearity. Basically, the flick will flash backwards or forwards - with an accompanying title-card - in order to explain what's just happened, to elaborate on a recent reveal. The issue is that a reveal that's created simply by, rather clumsily, withholding vital information isn't really a reveal. It doesn't help that most of them aren't surprising - including the final big one - and that the elaborations are, well, overly elaborate and often uninteresting as compared to the forward narrative. These jolts in time get to be fairly frustrating, as they take you out of the experience rather than enhance it, and there's actually a sense that the story itself wasn't meant to be told this way. However, the narrative isn't terrible and there are some enjoyable sequences. It's cliché and predictable but competent and engaging enough. Having said that, there's no real sense of escalation, somewhat annoyingly, and a generally odd pace, which means that the movie ends - or gets to its climactic sequence - without any real warning, if you will. The actual finish isn't abrupt - in fact, it's oddly drawn out - but the final showdown, as it were, almost arises from nowhere and, even though you can identify it while it's happening, isn't alluded to either in the story or in your immediate perception of the structure. This is an even bigger problem than usual for a picture that plays with its structure on the regular. Still, the feature is fairly fun at times and is never terrible, by any means. It's occasionally dull but is relatively compelling and fairly entertaining throughout. I'd say it's Besson's best attempt in years. I'm not quite sure how much that says, though. 5/10",Anna
16,richardchatten,"""Adversity is a Good Teacher""",8,13 September 2021,"After a flaccid opening half-hour, this slick, globe-trotting rehash by Luc Besson of his earlier hit 'Nikita' nostalgically set in the dying days of the Cold War develops an extremely dry sense of humour with the entrance of Helen Mirren (real name Mironoff) having a rare old time in ugly spectacles as the chain-smoking love child of Quasimodo and Rosa Klebb; and the beginning of the killing spree that comprises most of the rest of the film.The violence - as is usual with Besson - is sexier than the sex, and the film manages the odd surprise with the aid of an interesting flashback structure, with Mirren satisfyingly getting the last word.",Anna
17,ThomasDrufke,Besson Pursues Style Over Substance Here,6,8 July 2019,"For a director like Luc Besson, you come to expect greatness from the spy-action-thriller genre, however, with Anna it's far more style over substance. Besson implements a particular directing tactic that got on my nerves from the second it appeared on screen, the ""8 hours earlier"" tactic. Rarely does it work when a director decides to tease a certain event, only to retroactively tie loose ends together by doing a ""previously while you were paying attention to something else"". For awhile, it felt like something done in post production but instead it was more than likely a choice made before filming, thus trying to separate itself from a genre of films that feel all too formulaic and repetitive these days. The action itself is fun and it takes a lot of mistakes for me to dislike a spy-action-crime-thriller, so on that front 'Anna' is worth a watch. Heck, Cillian Murphy always demands my attention, and Luke Evans is certainly getting there, but I think Besson's script is where the film fails. Especially as he tries to convince you of a few romances in the third act between characters who didn't have nearly enough screen time together or development to warrant such a relationship. Perhaps Besson would be best suited taking on scripts from other writers as he's far from the critical darling he used to be.6.1/10",Anna
18,MLDinTN,hot girl spy thriller,6,10 March 2020,"This is one film that uses double crossing to its advantage and the out of time sequences make sense. Anna, a hot Russian girl, is recruited into the KBG. And in a very unbelievable short time span, she becomes one of the top agents. She is sent under cover to Paris as a model and has orders to elimanate bad guys that don't favor the Russians. And some where along the way, she gets made by the CIA. Then the double crossing begins quite a few times. And she has plans at the end to live the free life she has longed for.Action scenes are quite cool. Of course, it's one of those movies that is like how can the one girl shoot everyone, but the other guys always miss. So she escapes some pretty impossible scenarios.FINAL VERDICT: Good spy flick with some twists. Worth watching.",Anna
19,A_Different_Drummer,Before you fall in love with this movie ...or its star,9,28 March 2020,"You need to understand that Besson has done better, but not recently; men will tend to commit to this movie more than women, and the fight scenes are to die for. Negative reviews are from ""critics"" in denial about the fact that no one is making decent spy films anymore, so this is an oasis in a desert.",Anna
20,westsideschl,Kills & Twists,8,10 October 2019,"Anna enters John Wick territory for number of kills by an individual. For our Russian assassin it was ballpark 70. Usually, especially in Asian martial arts movies, the confrontations strain credulity to the point of boring (if such events can be described as boring). But, not with Besson as an intelligent creative producer of action/drama films he keeps you guessing. In this case we are kept off balance by the twists 'n' turns as Anna fights her way to freedom. Like the Matryoshka doll (stackable dolls) w/each Anna exposure we get an unexpected different look. Luss & Mirren's acting as Anna & Olga - quite good.",Anna
21,tabuno,A Near Perfect Miss,8,25 June 2019,"This Luc Besson multi-twist on his classic female assassin thriller 1990s La Femme Nikita which personally was actually improved upon by John Badham's 1993 American version entitled ""Point of No Return"" incorporates among the most twists of any thriller movie. Even more amazing, all the twists really work and the audience is able to easily comprehend each one and so can enjoy the film even more by just sitting and experiencing the delicious sensation of all the new reveals in this somewhat complex movie. Using a multitude of flashbacks which ultimately and surprisingly work, the audience is made aware of the real story behind what seems to be occurring on screen and the audience is led to relive many extended scenes from a different perspective. There are a number of parallels between Anna and La Femme Nikita/Point of No Return. Luc Besson has extended the psychic drama of the female assassin even further in this new version of the female good/bad persona. Besson doesn't spend a lot of time on specialized training as in his original work leaving a lot of room for the many interplays between Russian and American intelligence agencies in the field, with the American's presence actually seemingly dissipating from the movie for awhile but coming back with a vengeance later.Besson at two places in the movie appears to have fallen into the trap of the current violent mayhem fashions of the latest spy movies such as John Wick 3 (2019) or Hitman 47 (2015). Such scenes seem to be a sort of fantastic stylized Kill Bill Vol 1 (2003) and for Anna seems to be a little overkill to be taken seriously. To give credit to Besson, his choreographed fight scenes are deliciously photographed and well prepared, even standing out a bit from the many bloody shoot outs recently seen in other movies including Brian Miller's The Prince (2014) or Edward Zwicks' Jack Reacher: Never Go Back (2016). The plot in some ways takes from the more moody and psychological spy thriller Fred Schepisi's The Russia House (1990) adapted from the spy master novelist John le Carré and then adds it own attempt to create a intricately plotted spy movie but with a lot more sustained action. The more convoluted relational aspects of this movie also provide a more juicy and intriguing set of humanistic circumstances.Overall, this movie is well executed and almost becomes it own classic, almost setting a new bar for espionage movies. Susha Luss as a new refreshing face and performer brings a nice vitality and picturesqueness to her role. Yet there are few shots that either she or the director miss in terms of the sustained, expected professional character of her role even though the movie is supposed to have a renewed focus on an assassin as a human being. Especially problematic is a pivotal scene where she is confronted with the possibility of a point-blank death. And the ending is solid and creative, it just doesn't quite have that amazing, huge breakthrough that would make this movie into a new class of its own.",Anna
22,slightlymad22,Surprisingly Decent,7,17 July 2019,"I just got out of watching Anna.Now I have a real soft spot for Luc Besson, as he made 3 movies in a row, which I absolutely loved (The Big Blue, Nikita and Leon) but I have enjoyed nothing since and have stopped watching his movies altogether.I had no intention of watching this movie, as the trailer looked bad and it didn't interest me at all. But my eldest son asked me to go with him, and he has seen everything else playing, so Anna it was.There were 7 people in, not counting me and my son. And I can't believe I'm going to say this, but it wasn't bad!! It was certainly better than the last few Steven Seagal movies I have watched.I will say this straight off, the movie is sold/marketed wrong. The trailer (which I have seen numerous times on the big screen totally fails to convey what the movie is about, instead it just focuses on the movies two only action set pieces (not counting a car chase) the main one in the restaurant is half an hour in, and the last one is almost at the end. It's a lot more like Red Sparrow than the all out constant action trailer suggests.Don't get me wrong, its violent, you see plenty of people die and it's very bloody, but it really wasn't what I was expecting. It is not straight forward either, it has more time hoping than Highlander, it is set in 1985, 1987, 1990 and 1991, but hops all over the time lines at different points, never following a straight narrative.My son agrees that if it followed a straight narrative line, it would not have been anywhere near as interesting, as it was, it held our attention all the way through and we both enjoyed it.Luke Evans and Cillian Murphy are both fine in their supporting roles and Dame Helen Mirren, simply steals every single scene she is in.But it is Sasha Luss's movie and she does a fine job, I don't think I have seen her in anything before, if I have, she didn't stand out, but she was decent here, she handles all her scene's really well.My only really complaints we're the action scenes were very John Wickish, in that it's just one person in kill mode on a computer game fighting countless, nameless goons.All in all, I was pleasantly surprised.",Anna
23,UniqueParticle,Visionary Luc Besson at it again,8,26 June 2019,"A badass mix of Atomic Blonde, John Wick, and Leon:The Professional! Sasha Luss model extraordinarie and professional spy extravaganza! I wasn't sure what to think at first but I enjoyed this a fair bit. Unbelievable choreography, skills, and beautiful shots. A nice bag of CIA and Spy's both of which are incredible at being discreet. Some of the action sequences are epic and gory; I was surprised by the audience - mostly older people kinda cute, they don't mind this thrill ride - I loved it though!",Anna
24,cruise01,Sasha Luss is the next beautiful action star worth looking out for.,8,28 June 2019,"Anna (4 out of 5 stars).Anna is an action thriller that delivers the gritty action, a plot that feels like an unraveled puzzle, and great talent. The plot follows Anna (Sasha Luss) who is recruited by Alex (Luke Evans) to join the KGB. And become an assassin. Which the CIA Lenny (Cillian Murphy) is on their trail. When Anna was recruited, she was hoping to get out of her hard life and to find her freedom to begin a new life.The plot may be a little convoluted. And all over the place. It all makes sense in the end when every scene is put together. And after you get through several plot twists and turns. The film does jump around with the time jump. One scene jumps several months earlier. Then, there is a jump years later, and another jump earlier. Just for the story to fill you in a plot twist.The action sequences are exciting and fun. Sasha Luss does play a bada** character. That begins with her living with a deadbeat junkie. Until she is recruited by the KGB and they have her go undercover in a modeling tour. I will say she is probably the female version of John Wick in a way. She is beautiful, ruthless, and she is fierce with her fighting skills. Sasha Luss performance is good. Luke Evans is also good as well playing her recruiter. Cillian Murphy playing a CIA operative, who is on the hunt for Anna. Helen Mirren playing Anna's boss is also good as well.Writer/ Director Luc Besson did a well job in directing Anna. The film is kind of similar to several other assassin like films like The Professional, Atomic Blonde, Red Sparrow, and John Wick. The music score by Eric Serra is also stunning. Kind of feels like he is keeping that 1980s music score for those type of action films.Overall, Anna is a good action thriller. If you are into Atomic Blonde or John Wick. This is definitely a film for you. The plot is good if you can get by all the time jumps with the storyline. When you get to the climax with Cillian Murphy's CIA character, Luke Evan's KGB, and Sasha Luss all after one thing from each other and ends with a good payoff. It is entertaining, exciting, and there is a few twists and turns that makes this action film worth seeing.",Anna
25,leonblackwood,Average Nikita type movie! 5/10,5,1 February 2020,"Review:
I'm usually a big fan of Luc Besson's work, but this film just seemed like a Nikita, Leon and Lucy mash-up. The action scenes were far-fetched but well choreographed and the storyline had enough twists to keep the audience intrigued throughout, but my main problem was Sasha Luss (Anna), who showed little emotion from the beginning of the film. I know that she went through a lot as a child, and with her boyfriend but I just couldn't warm to her. With other TV series and movies in this genre, like Killing Eve and Leon, the main character is what made them special, but in this film, it's really Helen Mirren (Olga) who completely stole the limelight. Luke Evans (Alex) and Cillian Murphy (Lenny) also put in decent performances, and the cinematography went will with the plot, but I was really disappointed with the ending and I lost sympathy for the main character, after watching her murder everyone that came in her path. Anyway, Anna, a young Russian beauty who has been the victim of domestic abuse, will do anything to escape the life she is trapped in. In a twist of fate, she reluctantly accepts an offer by KGB affixed Alex. After a year of training, which is not shown in the movie, she is to work as a KGB assassin for five years under a handler named Olga, after which she will be free to continue her life as she pleases. KGB head Vassiliev is not willing to honour this agreement, implying that the only way out of the KGB is death. She goes undercover as a fashion model and is hired to work in Paris. At the same time, she completes various missions and assassinations. When she is found out by the CIA, she agrees to work for them as a double agent with Agent Miller as her handler, in exchange for the promise of immediate retirement and protected life in Hawaii. Miller later tasks her with assassinating Vassiliev, with the CIA hoping that his absence would lead to smoother relations with the KGB. Anna kills Vassiliev and fights her way out of the KGB. She later arranges a meet with Alex and Miller, bartering information she stole from the two agencies in exchange for a six-month reprieve. As she is leaving, she is ambushed by Olga and fatally shot for betrayal. But all is not what it seems! There are so many twists in the film, you really don't know what is true or not. The only problem is that the director shows the outcome before you see what really happens, which was a mistake in my opinion. I would have preferred for the outcome to be a surprise, not the plan beforehand. Anyway, it really didn't do that well at the box office, due to a poor advertising campaign and the fact that it wasn't that great, so it has to go down as a bad day at the office for Luc Besson. It's still a watchable film, but once you know the outcome, and the twists throughout, I can't see it being worth a second watch. Average!Round-Up:
This movie was directed by Luc Besson, who also brought you The Last Battle in 1983, Subway, The Big Blue, Nikita in 1990, Atlantis, Leon in 1994, The Fifth Element, Joan of Arc, Angel-A, Arthur and the Invisibles, Arthur and the Great Adventure, The Extraordinary Adventured of Adele Blanc-Sec, Arthur 3: The War of the Two Worlds, The Lady, The Family, Lucy and Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets. Although he has produced some great movies, most of them have been flops, which is a shame because he has a unique style of directing and storytelling. As he is highly respected in the movie world, it's not hard for him to get established actors to star in his projects, which he should have done for the lead in this film, but I doubt that the poor box office takings will tarnish his reputation.Budget: 30million Euro

26,Tweetienator,Solid Shoot Out,7,16 September 2019,"Well, I don't get all those harsh critics about the lack of realism, for example regarding the fight scenes, I mean, common, of course a killing machine like Anna is an impossibilty, but does anyone complain about the killing capacities of guys like James Bond, John McClane or John Wick!? Those movies any more realistic!?
Anna is simple a nice entertaining action flick with some good fights, a beautiful and well performing actress, but for certain one of the more conventional and simpler movies made by Mr. Besson. All in all a good movie with some twists and fun moments but no masterpiece.",Anna

28,Vartiainen,Formulaic but entertaining,7,9 September 2021,"Luc Besson's latest film visits a trope he's more than well acquainted with. That of a femme fatale. Sasha Luss plays Anna Poliatova, an agent for the KGB whose latest job has her masquerading as a top fashion model in Paris.I've always enjoyed Besson's style and this film is no different. His worlds have that subtle gloss to them, that sprinkle of razzle dazzle that sets them apart from the humdrum of real life without being over the top about it. Everything is just ever so slightly bigger, cooler and more pronounced than it would otherwise be.The film has also attracted some acting talent, from Luke Evans to Helen Mirren to Cillian Murphy. In contrast Luss is a much more of an unknown, but she does credible job acting against these stars. Albeit I have to admit that she was the most boring character by far. But at least half of that is the script.Then again, the actual plot was interesting enough. Formulaic to a point, yes, but told well. Besson keeps you guessing until the very end and expecting the unexpected is probably the wisest move.Nothing groundbreaking and Besson has done better films in the past, but if you're a fan of his style, the film is well worth checking out.",Anna
29,paul-allaer,"Somewhat of a mess, albeit a beautiful mess",5,29 June 2019,"""Anna"" (2019 release from France; 118 min.) brings the story of Anna M., super-model and kick-ass KGB agent. As the movie opens, we are told it is ""Moscow 1985"", when a number of people are rounded up by the KGB and presumably killed. We then go to ""5 Years Later"", when a French guy looking for the next super-model by happenstance runs into Anna at a market, and promptly offers her a modeling job in Paris. Anna is more than happy to accept and escape her bleak existence in Moscow. During her first modeling job, Anna makes the acquaintance of another Russian guy... At this point we are 10 min. into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the latest film from veteran French writer-director Luc Besson, who has quasi-trademarked the action movie with strong female lead genre, all the way back to ""Nikita"" in 1990, yes, almost thirty years ago. Here he once again pairs up with Russian model-turned-actress Sasha Luss (who also starred in Besson's previous movie, the big budget sci-fi ""Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets""). The movie's plot is as confusing as it is basically irrelevant. We watch things unfold without having any idea why (does the KGB really need one of their agents to become a super-model to achieve what they want to achieve? why is the KGB targeting certain people? etc. etc.). It's all about watching Sasha Luss kicking some major butt, and that she does, often, and in style. This is best capsuled in the pivotal restaurant scene 40 min. into the movie (and also featured prominently in the movie's trailer), where Anna needs to take out a guy, but things go wrong and she ends up fighting everyone in the restaurant, and she only has 5 min. before the getaway car will drive off. Sasha Luss is nothing short of a formidable fighting machine, in a highly choreographed ballet-like fight to the death, while of course looking drop-dead gorgeous all along. Frankly, the movie is a mess, but always a beautiful mess. Helen Mirren is wickedly fun as the KGB supervisor. ""Anna"" is another bug budget movie (for European standards) and looks and feels that way, with gorgeous scenery and photography throughout. It is no accident that this movie is set in the 1985-1990 era, as it seems that Besson is doing exactly the same in ""Anna"" that he was doing in 1990's ""Nikita"". Time has stood still, apparently, ""Anna"" is too long a film for its own good (2 hours) and the script is flawed, but I still enjoyed some of the scenes for what they were. In that sense, this movie fits closely the ""John Wick"" mold.""Anna"" opened wide last weekend to so-so critical acclaim and box office. The Friday evening screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati was attended poorly (7 people, including myself), and I don't see this sticking around in theaters much longer. If you like the ""John Wick"" franchise, or enjoyed any of Luc Besson's earlier action flicks, chances are you will enjoy ""Anna"", despite its obvious shortcomings, and I'd readily suggest you check it out, be it in the theater (while you still can), on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion.",Anna
30,subxerogravity,Had my fingers cross this would be a good one. Then I uncrossed them.,7,30 July 2019,"I seen this movie before and I still like it.
La Femme Nikita, Miss Baja. Even a Charlie's Angels Chinese adaption called Char Lai's Angels.
The funny ironic twist is that because there are only a handful of those super hot model chick trained to be a spy movies, they tend to look more alike as a result. That's bad in the case of Anna, cause I like the movie it's trying to copy, but it's a bad copy of that movie.
The action scenes were way better than the trailer let on and they had more than the trailer let on, but not even the fight where she uses the dinner plates to bash her opponents really leaves a lasting impression. Way to much of a waste of time proving how cleaver Anna is cause in the end she was not that cleaver. Should have spent more time kicking ass and taking names.
Anna fumbles the ball too much when it tries to be cleaver.",Anna
31,stevendbeard,Nikita Without Nikita,8,23 June 2019,"I saw ""Anna"", starring Sasha Luss-this is her second movie, with Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets being her first, she was a model before that; Helen Mirren-The Fate of the Furious, Calendar Girls; Luke Evans-The Fate of the Furious, Dracula Untold and Cillian Murphy-The Dark Knight movies, Inception.
This movie is written & directed by one of my favorite film makers, Luc Besson. He wrote or directed the Transporter movies, the Taken movies, Lucy, The Fifth Element and La Femme Nikita to name just a few. And this movie reminds me a lot of a Nikita reboot, only without Nikita. Sasha plays a Russian girl that is brought into the KGB by Luke to become a trained assassin. Helen is her trainer. Sasha becomes one of their best undercover field agents, skilled in hand to hand combat as well as firearms and other spy survival techniques. When she is not on missions for her mother Russia, she is a model. She catches Cillian's attention, who is a C.I.A. agent that had just lost a lot of his field agents to the Russians-before Sasha became an agent-and wants to redeem himself by catching her. There are lots of twists in the story and lots of scenes that show things that have happened earlier in the story but are now seen from a different perspective and you learn new information.
It's rated ""R"" for strong violence, language and sexual content-including nudity-and has a running time of 1 hour & 59 minutes.

This film is being released just in time to reassure any wavering blue collar voters in Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania that Leader Trump (with his INCREDIBLES-like immediate family members) will solve America's ""Putin Problem"" BEFORE the 2020 POTUS re-election. ANNA shows that by feigning to be Commie KGB assets, the extended Trump Clan now has the run of the Kremlin. No doubt genius businessman Trump has skimmed off billions and billions of rubles that the corrupt Russian oligarchs have stolen from their mush-headed subjects, under the guise of ""money laundering."" These would-be masters of Russian collusion probably think that this gives them some sort of leverage over the Trumps. However, ANNA documents the way in which the Trumps are bound to have the proverbial ""last laugh,"" thanks to their superior American brain power.

38,jimbo-53-186511,"Overwritten, uninvolving cold war era espionage - feels like Besson is trying a little too hard here",3,3 April 2021,"Anna is at a really low point in her life when she is approached by Alex Tchenkov and offered a way to clean up and take a step away from her current lifestyle. Over a short period of time Anna is trained by the KGB and becomes one of their top assassins. However, as the body count starts to stack up Anna's activities become of interest to a certain government agency across the pond leaving Anna with some difficult decisions to make...I've got a lot of time for Luc Besson and even though some of his more recent films haven't been up to the same standard as his earlier work they are by and large entertaining, but Anna is probably the first time I've seen a Luc Besson film that I haven't found to be particularly thrilling...The film spans Anna's journey across a number of years and Besson uses flashbacks to jump backwards and forwards in time in order to explain Anna's journey and explains how all the pieces of the puzzle are formed together to complete the jigsaw. There's nothing wrong with this per se as this is a common narrative technique these days, but here it feels overdone almost to the point where Besson is giving no room in the story for the audience to try to fit some of the pieces of the jigsaw together themselves (I'll come back to why this is a problem with an example later). Aside from an overstuffed narrative, Anna also lacks excitement and thrills and the story is rather rote and uninteresting (these things are not helped by a rather bland performance from lead actress Sasha Luss). Even more capable actors like Cillian Murphy and Luke Evans fail to make that much of an impression (different accents are about as much as they bring to the table). The one bright spot from an acting point of view came from Helen Mirren who is suitably cruel whilst still being slightly maternal and respectful towards Anna all the same.I think the main problem with this film is Besson's need to explain everything that is happening in far too much detail at every turn of the story. This leaves very little room for free thought from the viewer making for a fairly predictable viewing experience; an example of this is when Anna uses a body double to escape the hotel at the halfway point in the film and then uses one again when we're supposed to believe that she is dead at the end of the film. Had this not been revealed already at the halfway point in the film then this may have been a semi-good twist, but it's already pretty clear that this was going to be the case when Olga tells her she will guarantee Anna's freedom. This is one example of overwriting and needless to say there are countless other examples dotted throughout the film. Essentially, it robs the film of any sort of suspense or surprise which again wouldn't have been as bad if the film was fast-paced and exciting which it most certainly is not.One other thing I also couldn't understand was how the CIA were able to enter the hotel room where the KGB had installed a camera above the door without anybody noticing and also how did they know where the gun was hidden so that they could replace the real cartridges with blanks? I don't recall this ever been explained???In all honesty, I think Besson concentrated far too much on trying to make the film look clever and not enough time on making it remotely exciting, suspensful and thrilling. As it is Anna is an overwritten, excruciatingly dull film which looks as though it's been made up of bits and pieces that have been left on the cutting room floor by other filmmakers and coming from someone with Luc Besson's talents it is a huge shame.",Anna

41,kluseba,Shallow but enjoyable,7,15 March 2020,"Anna is an entertaining action-thriller in the key of Atomic Blonde, Hanna and Red Sparrow. Directed by veteran Luc Besson, the movie tells the story of a beautiful drug addict who is given the opportunity to work as a KGB spy. After a hard training, she is sent to Paris where she works as a model and is in a relationship with a female French colleague while secretly executing enemies of the state and stealing confidential information. Soon enough, the CIA gets aware of her activities and sets a trap for her. She is forced to kill her own superior in exchange for freedom and a fresh new start in Hawaii. However, Anna starts making her own plans as she knows that she can't rely on anyone but herself.The movie has numerous obvious flaws. The story is too closely inspired by the aforementioned movies, extremely predictable and completely exaggerated. The movie includes numerous unnecessary errors such as people using modern laptops in the mid-eighties. The numerous shifts in the timeline are annoying, confusing and overused.The movie is best enjoyed if you switch your brain off and don't ask yourself any questions. The action sequences are breathtaking. The diversified locations add a lot of atmosphere. Rather unknown lead actress Sasha Luss convinces as unpredictable femme fatale while veteran actress Helen Mirren steals the show as grumpy Soviet handler.Anna isn't a movie that will win many awards or leave significant marks. However, it's enjoyably fast-paced and vividly entertaining. It offers its viewers two vibrant hours to escape from reality and that should be considered good enough in bleak times like these. Grab a few beers, get some snacks and enjoy this film with your family members or friends.",Anna

She's introduced to a Russian partner of the modelling agency, starts a relationship with him and one day executes him. 3 years earlier she was poor in Russia involved with some abusive husband. For the heck of it she applies to the navy. One day her husband and his crew decide to rob a rich guy, but the robbery goes wrong. When she arrives at home desperate a guy is waiting for her at home. He recruits her for the KGB after she tries to kill herself out of hopelessness. But this guy offers some glimps of hope. A 5 year (huh?) stint in the KGB and freedom afterward.3 years later after the killing of the Russian guy she's questioned, not buy French police but by an American CIA guys. He lets her go.6 months earlier we are told she gets trained and does well. Some lady who runs operations reluctantly accepts her. Anna's first major assignment is to kill some guy in a restaurant in 5 minutes. As she approaches the guy she realizes she's got no ammo in her gun. Now she has to fight scores, and I mean, scores of bad guys. Outside the lady and her recruiter wait for her. They give her an extra minute, but she doesn't make it in time. Still, she's forgiven for her delay. And for her next mission she given a bunch of files to learn.At this point we learn that mission was actually to kill the Russian guy and how the KGB set it all so she would be found by this model scout to unwittingly set up her cover as a model. After this succesful operation she meets the KGB boss.She's tired and frustrated with both her jobs. She's involved with her recruiter and with a fellow model as part of her cover. But for no good reason she wants out.One night her mission is to play a prostitute hired by some German guy and she has to get all sorts of stuff from him and then kill him. Again she doesn't complete her mission but has to go back and finish things up. Then she gets a much desired vacation.She keeps modelling and killing. And one day plays chess with the KGB boss and then suddenly shoots him.Well, then there's a revelation. During that German guy mission she was confronted by the CIA guy. They have been all over her of course. He offers her a job. She accepts after he agrees to have her work for a measly year and then give her a new life in Hawaii. She gets involved with this guy as well. Her mission for the Americans is to kill the KGB boss because he was the one who eliminated all those US agents in the intro and the American was in charge at the time so he wants his revenge. Anna of course completes the mission, but again, things don't go smooth. She doesn't make it to the rendezvous with the American so he thinks the Russians have her. He gets a text one day from her to meet her in Paris. Once in Paris the American runs into Anna's KGB recruiter who is also there waiting for her. Anna arrives, kisses both guys, and makes a deal with both for her freedom. They reluctantly agree, but there are more twists and turns.Anna is your usual Luc Besson action movie. There's a lot to like here and some things that don't convince. The concept is an interesting one--and KGB vs CIA spies always makes for a good topic. Sasha Luss is cute and the restaurant fight scene is pretty outstanding. There's also a car chase scene. For once, all the main performances are strong, which is unusual in a Besson movie. Even Cillian Murphy who for some has never convinced me does an outstanding job here. Luke Evans's work is always solid. But as often with Besson movies, sound production is awful. The fight scenes and car chase scenes sound terrible. Then there's the way the story is told. Anna's training and most of her KGB work is quickly glossed over. And yet we are told she lives like a slave who yearns for nothing more than freedom. What kind of KGB/CIA agent works for 5 year or 1 year anyway? So her main motivation for her actions doesn't work at all and it's also the main element of the story. So things are shaky in that regard. As a result, for a good chunk of this movie, there is no development, nothing is at stake. Then suddenly we get all the twists, turns, and surprises and all loose ends are tied up. It's never quite satisfying when the audience is tricked or cheated this way, even when it's done with the best of intentions. The way Besson and Anna put it, this is about Anna as a Matryoshka doll, trying to discover who she really is on the inside. Fine, but they should have found a better way to convey this. With a tighter editing and more focus on action this would have been a better movie. Still as it is, it's very thrilling and entertaining and the great performances make Anna work.",Anna
43,masonfisk,NOT A GAME CHANGER BUT IT'LL HAVE TO DO...!,6,2 July 2019,"Luc Besson's (Lucy/The Fifth Element) latest returns him to the cinematic ground he first mined w/La Femme Nikita back in 1992. With many of the same story beats lifted from its predecessor, we find ourselves in Russia as a girl (Sasha Luss who played a motion capture alien in Valerian) is pulled from obscurity (she has a table in a city bazaar where she hawks knickknacks) to become a fashion model but when we see her befriending a fellow countryman at a party only to end up assassinating him, we know something is afoot. Using a weird time structure, we learn she's actually a hit woman cultivated by the KGB to perform hits on various people of ill repute all in the service of Mother Russia. Hoping her time as a killer is finite (she's constantly harping about the fact that she'll be in for 5 years then out...as if that's ever the case), she continues her missions but when the CIA, in the guise of Cillian Murphy (Scarecrow from the Nolan Batman films), get her under their thumb, a cross/double cross effect ensues whereby we don't know (& maybe she doesn't either!) who she in fact is working for. Competently directed (Besson pretty much has made the best European action films in the last 30 years or so) but ultimately disheartened by the fact he really brings nothing new to the table, this film is passable but forgettable. Ample support on the Russian side by stalwart British vets Helen Mirren & Luke Evans make this schmaltz go down easier & its nice seeing Besson working w/his usual DP Thierry Arbogast & his longtime friend & film composer, Eric Serra, for the first time in many a year.",Anna

Summary: Spy films are always about the character bringing the bang to the buck for me and that requires good acting. Sasha Luss was a great front woman for this type of film, decent balance if dialogue, the carrying of the femme fatale energy, the suaveness, and the layered emotion were executed quite well over the course of the film. Helen Mirren as sort of her mentor/boss, another fine display of the legend's talents to bring so much to the film. The cast of the characters works very well together, fashioning a convoluted band of spies who are complex and untrustworthy, perfect for a movie about spies. Yet amidst the carbon copy roles of the arrogant and monotone spies, Anna actually has a little more to her character hidden in that façade of boredom and eternal calm. As the story unfolds, Anna starts to reveal more of the dolls nestling in this KGB spy, each layer a different element that you weren't expecting, until the grand finale reveals the inner desire nestling within. Impressive to have that sort of buildup in a spy thriller, but welcomed for me. Fortunately she also manages to have some stimulation thrown in to the mix, and Anna's got an impressive amount of gunplay accuracy and some hand to hand combat that rivals Black Widows earlier days that helps liven up the movie. To be honest though, I loved the costumes and wardrobe of the film, with the designers doing a fantastic job of bringing the emotion to the scene through the styles and aliases that Anna wore. It's slick, sexy, and stunning in all form that goes so well with the themes of the movie and the character they are building, plus a few members commented how they found the clothes stunning as well, so that aspect is good too.
Here is the problem though, the pace of this movie is not quite as thrilling as the trailers made it to be. Anna's presentation is slow, utilizing the ideas of executing acts and then going back in a set of flashbacks to explain how it got there. It's unique, but after the third time of doing it, it feels like the Lord of The Rings series of constantly retelling the same tale. These multi-layered plot elements should engage those loving spy complexity, but the average audience might find themselves snoozing or walking out (the former I had to fight). Now while the action I think shows off the girl power motif, the problem for me (no surprise) was the lack of action and more so how stiff the sequences became. Anna's fights are very choreographed, lacking that element of raw action that great sequences hold, and that makes the attempt at injecting suspense a little lacking. Instead the raw passion went into the sexual moments, steamy bouts of animal passion that sort of display the art of seduction to the business at hand. While parts make sense, I would have liked a redirecting of the energy to some other elements that I had hoped Anna could show off. Yet, the attempt at character building puts an awkward love triangle into the mix as well, one that sort of elevates the underlying means of the a tale, but again could have been redirected in a better light. This leads me to probably the source of my limitations, the politics. Spy films are known for the political components they are trying to usurp, but this one took the modern-day political means into a new light and it did not work for me. The blatant statements towards modern issues becomes the central focus and in taking time to craft a character that bluntly states it, the rest of the story components sort of faulted for me.Overall, Anna has the style and suaveness in the character, crafting someone who has the attitude of the girl power movement and a spy with a little more heart nested in the stone-cold shell. While the movie has a lot of great acting to it, it cannot offset the pace and convoluted presentation, nor the stiff action/focus on sex that did little for me. Anna's espionage thriller may have a lot of visual appeal, but it does not quite have the same spy spark that I look for in my spy action thrillers. The lack of bang, and the okay story make this difficult to recommend for a theater visit, but if you are looking to get your spy flick, or want to be impressed by costume visual prowess, then have a go at this one this weekend.My scores are:
Action Thriller: 7.0

48,burlesonjesse5,VIEWS ON FILM review of Anna,7,26 September 2019,"""Which room?"" So says the fixed character of Anna Poliatova before going in for a mission-ed kill. Poliatova changes her downtrodden life by becoming a twenty-something KGB assassin in 2019's Anna (my latest review).Anyway, Anna is a sleek and sterile thriller with a female, John Wick kick to it. It's also another round of Luc Besson, his silencers, his femme fatales, his whipped car chases, and his cinematic, French-y cuisine.So OK, tell me how was this film overlooked? It made only $7.7 million in the US (and $28.4 million worldwide) but heck, after the lousiness that was 2014's Lucy, I kinda dug it.I guess Anna's low box office take might have been attributed to its sparse marketing efforts, its Keanu competition, and its nearly unknown lead in Sasha Luss. Looking like a Russian version of Jennifer Lawrence and having only one other movie credit to her dossier (Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets), Luss meets the physicality requirements of Anna Poliatova as well as the sudden, volatile nature. Move over Jason Statham and Jet Li because the gun-toting Sasha Luss kicks some serious arse.Anna's director, producer, writer, and maker of all things hit-girl, is Frenchman Luc Besson (mentioned earlier). Anna is Besson at his most Besson. It's also intricate, thinking man's Besson. Channeling his inner Rashomon while harboring a Mexican standoff and using his camera like a slithery serpentine on fire, Luc Besson makes Anna virtually recommendable.In conclusion, I liked Anna's various twists and revelations (told through flashbacks), its supporting performances from Helen Mirren and Cillian Murphy, and its groovy, bone-crackling action which ""kicks"" in at about the 40-minute mark (no pun intended). Bottom line: Anna may be familiar in the realms of the existing, button woman genre. Still, it's no ""Fata Mongana"". My rating: 3 stars.",Anna
49,justin-fencsak,Better than Luc Besson's last movie and reminiscent of his early movies,8,22 June 2019,"After the disaster that was Valerian, Luc Besson returned to his roots and created an original story about a lesbian Russian spy on the run. Taking place between the mid 1980's and ending in the early 90s when the Soviet Union collapsed and a new Russia began, this movie is worth seeing despite facing competition from bigger movies like Toy Story 4 and the remake of Child's Play. Sasha Luss , a 27 year old model, makes her first starring debut in a movie as Anna, with Cillian Murphy, known for playing Scarecrow in the Dark Knight series of films, as her boyfriend. Helen Mirren plays the bad momma who monitors Anna's every move. The plot travels back and forth in months and years but can be confusing yet entertaining. There's also lots of scenes in which people speak foreign with subtitles so read them. This movie will do better worldwide when it opens in France next month and on home media, where Luc Besson has found a cult audience raised on Taken and other films by him.",Anna
50,Luigi Di Pilla,Very good,7,14 December 2019,"This is the kind of movie how an action spy thriller has to work. Luc Besson created a great story with outstanding actors on all the lines. My wife and me were really good entertained. Perhaps there was one flashback too much but who cares it delivered all I have expected. Hope there will be a sequel. Check it out. 7/10

51,fntstcplnt,Anna (2019),5,12 April 2020,"Directed by Luc Besson. Starring Sasha Luss, Cillian Murphy, Luke Evans, Helen Mirren, Lera Abova, Nikita Pavlenko, Eric Godon, Alexander Petrov, Anna Kripa. (R)Director Besson reworks the highlight reel for another of his commercial action thrillers, too imitative for its own good. Young Russian Luss is recruited by the KGB to be an assassin, then by the Americans as a double agent, then...you see where this is going. Far-fetched even by the cartoonish standards of these sorts of stylized violent escapism fantasies, with a tendency to present ""shocking"" story developments that are then explained away by jumping to a series of flashbacks--trouble is, without investment in the blank-faced protagonist's feelings or fate, they just feel like awkward plot devices. Besson still knows his way around a preposterous set piece and delivers a couple that might have been real doozies if not for the fact that one copies a setup from ""La Femme Nikita"" and the other overuses the mindless pop-up-enemy arcade technique. In the pantheon of models-turned-actors, Luss is adequate, but far better at the physical aspects of the role than the emotional ones; Mirren and Murphy bring a little more zest than needed to the spy adventure staples they play. Like ""Atomic Blonde"" (a non-Besson flick from which he also borrows), the story is set in the Glasnost era of the late-80s/early-90s even though characters can be spotted using far more modern tech several times.51/100",Anna
52,nancyldraper,I liked it,7,22 February 2020,"I'm glad I didn't read the reviews before I watched this movie because I have a minority opinion, I really liked the movie. What captivated me was Anna, a woman challenged to escape the worlds imposed upon her. She constantly walks a tightrope between oblivion and hope. It is a character driven piece, first and foremost. If you aren't invested in the protagonist you won't like the movie. Sasha Luss brings beauty, strength, vulnerability, intelligence and a dark depth to her character. But, then, Luc Besson adds the bells and whistles: great supporting cast, two great fight scenes and gorgeous locations. Eventually the disjointed timeline becomes a necessity, but the number of these is jarring and they can interfere with the action or the flow of the story telling. I give this film a 7 (good) out of 10. {Character Driven Spy Thriller}",Anna
53,arungeorge13,"A middling actioner with a weak, predictable screenplay! [+44%]",4,1 June 2021,"Anna feels like the last sausage in the damn buffet because it's unevenly cooked and tastes bland. Luc Besson finds himself telling the story of an undercover operative (slash assassin) yet again, this time in uninteresting fragments that frequently jump timelines. The fashion world angle is the most boring bit while the hit jobs (a Besson mainstay) come across as better executed. Somewhere between those bizarre time jumps, there is a story of a drug addict struggling to win her freedom and live without worry. This emotional core rarely takes centre stage and is fleetingly sketched. Sasha Luss definitely looks the part and can wield a gun or two, however, I felt very little emotional connection to her character's vulnerabilities, choices, and decisions. Helen Mirren seems to have had fun in her role, while the leading men (Luke Evans doing a terrible Russian accent, and Cillian Murphy as the uninventive CIA operative) are positioned carefully to be shoved aside at the right moment. Some queerbaiting and zero-chemistry sex to add to that, the film is largely listless.",Anna
54,Abdulxoxo,Anna,7,22 November 2020,"Anna is an entertaining film. The fight sequences are intense and fantastically choreographed, the score, costumes and cinematography are all marvelous. The acting is good, the lead actress is convincing enough, and the supporting casts are unsurprisingly amazing.The 80s setting is sloppy tho, one could've sworn it was set in 2010s, 'cause everything looked so modish. The jumping back and forth with the storyline work at times but after sometime it became hard to follow, and the twists at the end are a bit too much to handle.",Anna
55,martimusross,"Unbelievable Story, But A Great Thriller!",8,11 July 2019,"AnnaThis was a highly stylised movie where the plot was very much subservient to the emotional needs of the drama. It had more than a French movie feel, the concentration on fashion and style, the way the camera moved, the stereotyping of good and bad characters, and then perhaps the reinforced mucho behaviour without apparent criticism explaining this is just the way life it.Anna, played by Sasha Luss, was mesmerising, not only was she devastatingly beautiful her ability to transform herself was beyond fascinating. Her casting in this role was perfection, she brought an intensity, a great emotional palette, a dominating physical presence and totally believable behaviour in a story that really sacrificed any believable reality. Helen Mirren was fabulous as was Luke Evans, the entire ensemble cast was fantastic.We nearly have a new genre that of oppressed Russian woman forced to work for the secret services against their will, Red Sparrow and now this, there are others of course.I loved this movie 8/10",Anna
56,MR_Heraclius,Anna,8,12 February 2020,"What a masterpiece! Absolutely fantastic acting. The sets are beautiful, even the clothing is so well thought out. It catches the eye and mind. The efficiency of the actress, the strong roles she plays. Sublime!",Anna
57,muamba_eats_toast,Great fun,8,18 July 2019,A little predictable at times particularly come the ending where it just went a little to far realism wise but other than that kept you guessing most of the film and felt stylish and tense. Great lead performance by a gritty action with like I said really stylish action scenes. There will be a lot worse spy action films before the end of the year.,Anna
58,saptesh786,Story of Dobule Agent Anna !,7,13 August 2019,"A story about a double agent of KGB and CIA who only want her freedom from them. Kick ass fight sequences and twists are highlighted part of the movie. Main character of Anna is well played by Sasha Luss. She is perfect in role of double agent who finding freedom from spy life. Secondly mentionable actress is her boss, Helen Mirren, you will definitely hate her and feel an sympathy for Anna. Direction is in different style from usual. First you see some scenes in present which you could not understand then story goes in past and starts from its root and reach to present day. Most of the movie goes in this way. This is a unique style catching your interest. End is open there is possibility of sequel. Let's see. Watch for Anna's fight sequences, which are worth to watch.",Anna
59,drjgardner,Besson ala Tarantino,9,22 June 2019,"Luc Besson adapts a time tripping narrative for his latest film, but he doesn't really have the comfort or skill in this area so well done by Quentin Tarrantino. But Besson retains his excellent directorial skills and his ability to write a film with intersecting 3-dimensional characters. Unfortunately he is mutating to the comic-book violence so popular now, but which wasn't a part of his best films (Nikita, Professional). You can never go wrong with a Besson film, and even his flawed films are better than most everyone else's endeavors. The cherry on this one is a great campy performance from Helen Mirren and good supporting jobs by Luke Evans and Cillian Murphy.",Anna
60,rockman182,Anna (2019),6,23 June 2019,"Extremely generic name aside, I was ready to see Luc Besson's newest entry. It looked like a mix of Red Sparrow and Atomic Blonde and its the type of female led badass film that I look forward to. Valerian (Besson's last film) was absolutely abysmal so Besson really needed this to work. There are things I like about Anna, mostly the style and Sasha Luss's portrayal of Anna, but the plot is just all over the place and so ridiculous. I wanted to like this more but Besson messes this up at many stages.The film is about a Russian spy who becomes a model and then starts moving towards her targets. She's very good at what she does but is overworked and has never really found freedom in her life. in the midst of working for the KGB she is contacted by the CIA and must then find out where her allegiance in love and career lie. The film also stars Helen Mirren, Luke Evans, and Cillian Murphy. Sasha Luss is a star though. Obviously, a wonderful looking model but also someone who may have a future in the acting business.The action doesn't really fail and the film is a lot more entertaining because of the lead we have but it never really gets into gear and takes off. First, the jumping timeline really screws with the narrative of the film and it really messy. The film becomes ridiculous when it keeps going back to earlier events and show how it really occurred. Bad twist after twist, we've seen it all before in the lowest quality of spy films. It mostly feels like an uninspired film by Besson who is off the rails recently with his work. The film only needed to be serviceable and it barely does that.Also, I see a trend of Besson getting young hot models in the hopes of showing how badass they are but they are usually sexualized in the film as well. Just my observation. I was fairly hyped for this film because I like this type of venture. I like women led action films but this one isn't something that leaves a good impression or even a general impression at all. Had to role my eyes on how independent they try to make Anna but how she gets held up with the love for two men along the way. Definitely, needed to be better than this.6/10",Anna
61,Holt344,Anna has memorable action sequences and well written characters,8,25 April 2021,"Sasha Luss portrays the title character alongside Luke Evans and Cillian Murphy. While they are terrific in this film, Sasha Luss who have only been in one film before this did a phenomenal job as the assassin. I didn't expect her acting would be good, her performance was one of the film's highlights and I'm certain she did the stunts too.Luc Besson wrote, directed and produced the film. My expectations was quite low but I was surprised in how good the movie was, well written action thriller with some good twists. But the best parts of the film is obviously the action and fight sequences, incredible and the violence is graphic but not extreme. The stunt coordinator did a phenomenal job, and it's one of the main reasons I could re-watch this film. Overall a 7.5 rating but the action sequences is entertaining and spectacular.Anna focuses not only on action but on the main character and the story that revolves around her. Memorable action film.",Anna
62,spookyrat1,This is the Movie Besson Should Have Made Instead of Lucy!,7,20 October 2021,"I have to admit, I wasn't expecting a lot after noting how Luc Besson's Anna was critically mauled and myself remembering how little I liked his last female hero - focused movie Lucy. Toss in as well that I was completely underwhelmed by his 2017 space opera film Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets and you might understand my misgivings. However it's pleasing to be able to report that I was pleasantly surprised with Anna.Yes it is arguably a reworking of his own La Femme Nikita. But seeing that was the original from which just about all other movies about female assassins have sprung, I think that gives Besson the right to tinker and rejig his own template. It ends up being his own take on the Red Sparrow sort of concept and I thought the competing narrative timelines structure of the film really added to the overall dramatic structure. The resulting twists we see played out are fair and reasonably logical, given what we have already seen.As is usual with a Besson film, it is technically well made and the casting, I thought was good. Lead actress Sasha Luss was very convincing as Anna and (What do you know?) Russian to boot. The other standout was Helen Mirran as Olga, who brought just the right tone of dry black comic humour to what ended up being much more than a support role of a prickly spy boss sending Anna out on her jobs.Anna is a stylish, slick, over the top action piece, which despite a certain predictability, will nevertheless keep you entertained throughout its running time. Upon viewing, like me, you may well end up being pleasantly surprised.",Anna

64,MihaiSorinToma,A wonderful experience,10,19 July 2019,"I have to admit that this is one of those movies which took me by surprise, obviously in a good way, judging by the rating I gave it. I was expecting it to be yet another action movie which tries so hard to impress through its fighting or shooting scenes that is forgets to also bring a good story to back it all up. Boy, I was so wrong. The plot it presents is simply astonishing, judging by the way it unfolds, the way it presents its key scenes by alternating between past and present and ultimately by its twists which I found quite satisfying and also hard to predict. It all goes so deep from this last point of view that it had moments when I thought I was watching a different type of movie. The cast it has is very good, interpreting very well each main character involved, while the action is also quite impressive with plenty of shootouts, fighting and chasing scenes, letting little time for less intense or suspenseful moments.I find it quite hard to find flaws when talking about it but I will mention one or two just to take them out of the way. The beginning of the movie was a bit slow. Not boring or something that might lead you away from the cinema, but still noticeable slower than the rest of the flick. Fortunately, it picks up pace pretty quickly, thus not making it a big deal. Another thing to be mentioned here is the quality of a few stunts. They don't look bad or something, but leave the impression that they could have been better done or shot.It's a movie which, as said in the beginning, started with mediocre expectations from my side but provided an excellent time. It's very entertaining, suspenseful and even a bit emotional at times but the best part about it is by far its plot. Together with the numerous action scenes, they are able to produce a movie which left quite an impression, at least as far as I'm concerned. Judging by the fact that the downsides were quite easy to dismiss, I can say that it's a very good movie which I can recommend to anybody which wants to have two hours of great entertainment. Oh, and a small subjective bonus when it comes to the overall experience, it was shot in 2D!",Anna

66,abisio,"A rethink of LA FEMME NIKITA with same director, more violent and as good as the original",9,23 June 2019,"LA FEMME NIKITA (1990) was the movie that made LUC BESSON a must see director. It did not have a great budget but I has three great leads and very interesting story about woman made a killing machine by the government. It also has the outstanding Jean Reno as THE CLEANER perhaps the most memorable thing of the movie (and the one missing here).
ANNA basically rethinks the back story of the woman; as Russian; and put her in the middle of KGB and CIA. Aside from the origin, here she is a very samar, sexually charged, cold blooded killer while in the original she was basically a petty criminal (with hints of being quite good at killing).
There are some script similarities to RED SPARROW; but this one is far more entertaining and action packed.
This time most of the cast is British; Helen Mirren outstanding as always, a very charismatic Luke Evans and a correct Cillian Murphy (his character is no big compared with Mirren or Evans). The big surprise is Sasha Luss as ANNA; she is quite believable and her acting chops are superb. It is not surprise that BESSON can make any actress shine; but her character is far more complex than the one of Anne Parillaud.
Action scenes are quite good and the twists not totally unexpected but smart enough.
In brief; very good entertainment but also a good quality one",Anna
67,silvermistvio,"Cleverness, twists and turns. That's the film I love!",9,14 September 2019,"Anna is a film that is packed with twists and turns. It shows how the main character is clever. I love those films where the main character and supporting characters are so clever. It's like one side of the rope pulled and the other side of it is also pulled back. No one knows who's going to win. That's what made me love this film.To be honest, when I decided to watch this film, I didn't expect it to be this great. And also I didn't know that it was about Russian-American thing. I was surprised to see that it's all about Russian and American. I'm not a fan of Russian and I always avoid those kinds of films. But this time, I watched because I wanted to know what this film was all about.What I don't like of this film is the presentation style. Too many earliers and laters. I feel like I was drawn back to the past and then got pulled back again to the present. That feeling isn't that good. And also throughout the film, that pattern is always the same. Once or twice is still OK. But a lot of times? Well, it's not. So, they should've done a better job with that.Another thing I want to mention is an effect they have made. I know that they were not really firing the real gun. They have done that with some effects in the background. But in the film, the way the bullets hit the body or the head and the way the blood came out after that didn't look like real. Maybe the effects to create this aren't that good. So, they also should have done better than this.All in all, Anna is really a great film to enjoy. There are a lot of unexpected things happened and some twists and turns behind it. I was so amazed to see those twists and turns because I didn't expect there were a lot of stories behind everything. The fighting scenes are also good. The performances of actors and actresses are also OK. Speaking of actors, I can't believe to see Luke Evans as an agent of Russia. He didn't seem like the one, you know? Anyway, conclusion is that if you want to see some twists, I recommend you to watch this film.",Anna

She is sent to Paris as pose as a supermodel and conduct a series of targeted assassinations. She soon finds herself trapped in the lifestyle and is unable to get out.The film is set between 1989-90 at the time of Glasnost, but this all seems to be about the KGB hanging on to its past, respecting of what else was going on in the world. Given that this is a Luc Besson film with its world of assassins, ignores any sense of realism such as international law or any international fall out from these killings other than by different government agencies and instead is about action, betrayal and subterfuge.Helen Mirren has a good scenery chewing role which she seems to enjoy as a James Bond type of Rosa Kleb Russian KGB boss.",Anna
70,Neptune165,"""Nobody is going to see it""",6,9 October 2019,"""Nobody is going to see it"" Yup, that's true. A typical assassin movie filled with a lot of cliches?!! This movie made a fatal mistake coming out around the same time as John wick 3 it just can't compete. Her story starts in 1987 and then you see the protagonist using a laptop to apply for a job on the Internet and later retrieving a cell phone (not a brick phone) in her first mission. And video quality of spy cameras, and the fashion - beanies and ladies motorcycle leather jackets are too advanced for 1990. ATM in USSR in 1987? I think Luc Besson was high when he wrote this. I actually really enjoyed this movie, Anna definitely isn't the most original movie, but I really like the movies it's derived from and I think it did enough things a little differently that it was still a very entertaining movie. the timeline could have been simplified it would have been a little less confusing! The story was good but the flip flops in time were distracting! I didn't knew this movie launched months ago because it launched out of NOWHERE. I never even heard of it, I wonder why the marketing did it so poorly, it's Luc Besson responsibility. the direction was terrible and the ending plot pretty lame like something out of a marvel movie or comic lol
This would be a better plot: It would be a lot better if the only flashback happens after she kill the KGB leader. Revealing all the CIA plot and then returning to the CIA guy waiting for her to exit but never appearing then at the end of the movie you could do the same Anna video when the KGB lady becomes the boss and revealing who was the real mastermind of the murder plot then you could end it there or do some quick flashback (still inside the Anna video scene, no time line jump) of her whit Anna revealing she knows she is working for the CIA because of the handcuffs marks etc then end the movie whit Anna watching the CIA guy in Hawaii from a distance, then she could smile and start walking away disappearing on a multitude of people thats would be great in my opinion",Anna

I'm not one to say the ad reviews are from viewers who didn't understand the film but in this case I must say that is so due to the mass of viewers who had trouble with the plot because of the timeline. It was very simple. And to the viewer who says there weren't cell phones etc back then the first cell phone was produced in79. I had one in 97 and ever since and I was in no means an early user.

Especially after that Well Shot Restaurant Fight Sequence.The plot, the main theme got lost in between transitions and weird choices those characters personally took that made not much sense.As for the performances, The actors have done their job Just decently; Helen Mirren was the better among them.
*As you would normally expect.
Although it's not about the actors themselves but the writing that had gone through on them. Here the Main Protagonist Anna, She's been shown as a merciless, ruthless spy ; who has the capability to Put down 10 times bigger guys than her With so much ease. She seems too powerful to relate! They should have presented her in a more natural, Realistic way ; Just Like Atomic Blonde did with Charlize Theron's Character!And the unnecessary Nude scenes! They were so annoying and Didn't hold much importance in my view. Maybe They all wanna be James Bond'ish' I guess!On the technical side, there were some cool cinematography moments but what I absolutely loath here is the Background Score! It was horrible. It couldn't really compliment those beautifully Shot sequences at all. It felt so Underwhelming and Half-Baked.Enough ranting, Now you may ask.

76,0w0,Massively unrealistic!,5,10 September 2019,"Totally unrealistic. You're telling me a 100pound female supermodel, can carry the weight of a 250pound dead guy? And break a man's neck with her bare hands? NOPE! I mean, in Luc Besson's other movie ""Lucy"", it makes complete sense that the female lead can do what she does, since she is superhuman... but this Anna girl, is just a normal human, yet she throws 250pound guys around like they are marshmallows. Also, MULTIPLE times in the movie, Anna assassinates people by shooting them once in the torso, then walking away... A real assassin will always double-tap, which adds to the unrealisticness of this movie. At one stage in the movie, 5 guys with AK47's are shooting full-auto at Anna, and not a single bullet hits her... I also don't understand why they forced the Anna actress to wear blue contact lenses? It's EXTREMELY distracting, and the actress has very nice naturally grey eyes actually, so why screw with that? It's pointless. OH, and I highly doubt that in the late 1980's laptops had webcams that could record at 720p btw. That's just one of the many time-period mistakes in the movie.",Anna
77,TheTruthofItIs,High fashion model cum Russian assassin,8,16 October 2019,"As others seem to note here, director Luc Besson has a following and much of his work is really good and interesting: La Femme Nikita, The Fifth Element, and Lucy . He wrote/directed this La Femme Nikia-esque action/fantasy tale of a Russian assassin under cover as a high fashion model. Yes, when she single handedly clears a room of armed bodyguards it stretches credulity but the scene is filmed so well and stylishly you can't help but enjoy it. ""Anna"" is full of twists and turns, too, with his using the let's-go-back-and-examine-how-we-got-here technique several times - yes, that can be confusing and may cause the need to re-watch it which isn't a bad thing.",Anna

This film offers nothing new to what Besson previously did but add a sanitized version of ""Red Sparrow"" to the mix. Updated and primarily in English versus French of the original. Some modern elements (i.e. bisexuality) and the multiple nations setting seems to harken to the copying the success of ""Atomic Blond"" as well as some retro era elements.

And kills all sorts of people and targets. With all due respect to Besson, he just keeps making these movies that are all the same: Nikita, Lucy and now Anna. All of them have this common problem - they are repeating themselves. It's the same plot all over again. No game changer, no surprises and no creativity. Even ""Salt"" which is not a Luc Besson film can be compared to this one and there won't be any difference. Just the same movie suffering from all these problems. The acting is fine I guess. You get a few well known actors and a rising star Sasha Luss (as much as you can call her a star). Finally ""Anna"" lacks creativity and falls short, maybe it's time for Besson to upgrade his genre of movies.",Anna

Well directed, beautiful sets and overall a very very good production as is typical with Luc Besson. Also typical of Besson, the action scenes were way way over the top. I think in order to get Hollywood distribution these days action scenes need to be unbelievable. But the film was far better than red sparrow which many people are comparing this to which I thought was just to leaden duck, that was horrible in every way including the star Jennifer Lawrence who is totally unconvincing as the seductress. This film worked, it was light fast, easy to watch and a lot of fun. Helen Mirren was great as was Murphy and our star who stole the movie. Her girlfriend was easy on the eyes too.

Moreover, do not pay attention to the manifold anachronisms: they are so numerous that dating the film becomes a real challenge. Finally, the actress Sasha Luss is too cold and insufficiently facial-expressive for my taste, whereas Anna (2019) globally lacks of inspiration.Personally, at the risk of seeming a grumpy old man, I had preferred Nikita (1990) in its time, which probably explains this disappointment, even if Anna (2019) is objectively entertaining.",Anna

94,stevenrotherforth,Come on movie people! Get more creative with naming your female assassins,7,4 November 2019,"AnnaWe've already had Hanna the movie about a young woman raised to be an assassin and also the excellent Prime Original TV show adaptation.
Come on movie people.
Think of a new name to give your female super spy assassins
There's plenty of names to choose from!
What about Mary, Gladys or even Mable?So now we drop the 'H' and get a new offering from Luc Besson creatively entitled 'Anna'.
This has nothing to do with the movie and TV show named 'Hanna'.
Or that spooky doll with the similar name!
This movie is about a beautiful Government assassin named ( yes you guessed correctly) Anna!
Starring the gorgeous Sasha Luss in her first lead role and with an impressive supporting cast.
This action thriller has more twists than a bowl of Fusilli pasta.Down and out Anna is recruited by the KGB with promise of a brighter future.
It soon becomes clear that Anna has no means of escape.
She just wants her freedom but is forced to
follow orders assassinating anyone who her KGB boss (Helen Mirren) commands her to.
Luc Besson's script is one that jumps back and forth sometimes becoming a little fatiguing but ultimately is a movie that is enjoyable.
This is mainly down to the performance of Sasha Luss.
She is convincing as the Super assassin and pulls off the action scenes along with the movies more tender moments.
Luss looks like a supermodel but still portrays the competent killer to dramatic effect.
It is sad that this film didn't get the publicity it needed to really launch Sasha Luss's career.Luke Evans supports as the man who recruits her.
Cillian Murphy also lends a hand as CIA agent Lenny Miller.
This movie has everything going for it but failed to light up the Box Office.
It's a typical Besson movie but it doesn't shine bright like his earlier work.
'Leon' being his stand out for me.
Still 'Anna' is a solid action thriller and for those who enjoy movies like 'Atomic Blonde' and the 'Bourne' movies', there should be fun to be had with this film.
It's not the best offering the genre has to give but a movie still worthy of your time.",Anna
95,iamjamalwhite,A poor man's ATOMIC BLONDE or RED SPARROW,7,27 June 2019,The first 30 minutes crawl like a made for TV movie. There are 3 seconds of nudity but a few very good fight scenes and a good car chase. It has a strong Russian spy school vibe. There are some good twists. The makers of the PROFESSIONAL cranked it out. You'll enjoy it if you can get through the first act.,Anna
96,Magow-Intermean,Anna Review,8,6 July 2019,"Russian model Sasha Luss is Anna - an intelligent, highly skilled, lethal assassin. The KGB employs Anna under the mentorship of Olga (Helen Mirren). Hired by a modelling agency, Anna has the perfect cover as she stacks up kills, working closely with her comrade Alex (Luke Evans). But as is the case with spy-thrillers, everything is not as it seems. To reveal any more of the plot would take away the element of surprise, and while that's generally avoided in assessing a film, it's a plot device that 'Anna' relies heavily upon. Unfortunately, this becomes detrimental. Don't let her striking beauty fool you. Anna is one of the world's deadliest assassins, and she's on a mission. Luc Besson has made a career out of female-centric films in the past, and he does well to establish Anna as a determined killer. Sasha Luss has ample moments to showcase her acting and fighting skills and is convincing enough in both areas, although the role demands a far more experienced and nuanced performance. Being paired with Helen Mirren certainly helps the newcomer, especially as the veteran actress adds emotional depth to some scenes that serve the film well. Mirren revels in the character as she clearly enjoys playing a tough-as-nails, no-nonsense KGB trainer. Luke Evans and Cillian Murphy put in strong turns as agents at opposite ends. But all their efforts can't salvage a convoluted screenplay.
Initially, 'Anna' effectively uses flashbacks to fill in narrative gaps after throwing one twist after the other. Sadly, there comes a point where they become increasingly far-fetched; cinematic liberties notwithstanding. This also leads to blurry motives. It's hard to pin down what Anna really wants, so when she goes full throttle killing everyone in sight, the action loses some steam. Add to the fact we've seen ample hand-to-hand combat, and gunfights in the recent past to be easily impressed. The action stakes have been raised, and 'Anna' is a couple of years behind on that front. Luc Besson's latest is stylish, yet indulgent in its execution to a fault. Yes, there's some fun to be had in this bonkers spy-thriller led by a tough female protagonist, but the gasps eventually develop into groans as 'Anna' tries to shock you at every turn.",Anna
97,room102,Highly recommended,6,24 July 2019,"Take two Brits to play Russians and an Irish to play an American. What do you get? ""Anna"" - One of the better movies I've seen this year. Luc Besson totally redeemed himself. Good script, good cast, good direction. Helen Mirren is a blast with thick glasses and even thicker Russian accent.",Anna
98,thomasjay-2201,Not much to see here,6,29 August 2019,"Almost forgot that I actually caught this in cinemas and were it not for the return of Peaky Blinders also starring Cillian Murphy I'd have forgot to leave a review. In fairness there's a few decent action sequences and the spy/thriller/espionage side of the film is very slick and effective but that comes at the cost of any real interesting plot, which eventually turns out to be the titular character playing every character against each other and somehow escaping the whole situation intact. Murphy is the standout actor but the cast of other notable faces are a welcome watch and do their best to perform in some manner. Average on the whole it's biggest let down is the constant jump after jump after jump in time which leads so many strands in the air and at times becomes difficult to keep up with. Finally though it's a decent watch for a rainy day",Anna

Repetitive, unfocused, and boring.In this action film, a woman with a troubled past becomes one of the KGB's most feared assassins.If writer/director Luc Besson (""The Professional"", ""The Fifth Element"") wants to continue making action films of this caliber, he'll have to kick it up many notches. Besson's issue is that we continues to make the same film over and over again but with slightly alternate storyline. It's old, been done before and ultimately boring. Who's the star of this film? Helen Mirren; who is incredible in every scene she's in. ""Anna"" has a one or two solid action sequences but beyond that it's nothing special.",Anna
100,ferdmalenfant,Not GREAT but GOOD!,7,13 September 2019,"OK, so it's not Besson's best film to date however, it is solid acting with a solid plot. Sometimes viewers don't like the going back and forth from past and present and there's a lot of that in this movie, the editing could have been better.
I didn't feel like this film failed to deliver. Yes, it is reminiscent of ""la femme Nikita"" (Besson's 1990 award winning film) but it also stands on it's own merits.
I know bad movies, this is not one of them.",Anna
101,DuskShadow,Spy movies are all over the place in the last couple years,5,11 March 2020,"So along comes yet another spy/ assassin film that just exasperates. Yet the actress was good, as were other notables in the film. AND YET...Along the lines of the dramatic world of espionage people have read about in novels for the last 30 years, comes yet ANOTHER tale of the KGB era Russian government taking young women that are vulnerable and desperate, and turning them into remorseless killing machines.
Like other Femme Fatales along the lines of La Femme Nikita, Dark Angel, the Doll House show, Black Widow from Marvel Comics, or Red Sparrow, we are being introduced to a world that is becoming questionably accurate as time goes on. And most of the stories take place right after the cold war ended decades ago.Though I hated Red Sparrow, it wasnt J Lawrence's fault for the crummy writing. The movie at least showed how things got rolling and progressed from point A to Z.But Anna does things with lack of substance and fails at explaining or showing just what the process and no doubt rigorous training was required to make a gal a killer.It just happens. BOOM! Better than 007 James Bond like its nothing. The movie jumps back and forth more than a Tarantino movie on crack. And I like Tarantino's films.
At the least the main actress was enjoyable to an extent, cute, and it was pretty interesting, though outlandishly unbelievable most of the time to see her in action. This young lady must have gone through more training regiments for this role than all the other Hollywood starlets in similar roles over the last few years. Because she really kicks some...tuchus.
A bit predictable, as its dealing with a subject now overly familiar to many viewers, but some might really like the film. As for myself, its a 5.5 out of 10. It just had me shaking my head too often. Helen Mirren rocks though.",Anna

105,thebricks,How does a 60 year old man make so many anachronistic goofs in a movie?,7,16 September 2019,"Good movie, but I've wondered for years if Luc Besson has still been in charge of many of the movies he makes? Anna actually wasn't bad. Some anachronisms aren't terrible if it's not noticeable or within a few years of their appearance. I remember Narcos Season 1 having some absolutely unforgivable anachronisms, rampant cellphone use in the eighties, Mercedes Benz vehicles that were from the late nineties, early 2000s, among other things. If you watch older movies, you can see exactly what tech was available and used.For starters, no one in 1987 USSR used a laptop to apply to the Russian Navy online!!! Especially junkies! I mean, was Luc Besson trolling everyone with that scene? I didn't even notice the USB flash drive used at some point that someone else mentioned. Someone else mentioned server racks, but I'm no expert on that. Cellphone use wasn't that crazy, there was one scene at the end that made me tilt my head sideways though. I was around back then, cellphones really didn't start being a thing until 1994. And they certainly didn't look like what Anna had in 1990!I did have a pretty good laugh at the video Helen Mirren's character received from Anna at the end. Anyone who was around in the nineties knows no one could just email someone an HD video message that would download that quickly! It would have come via the mail with a tape, lol. I don't even think AT&T invented their videophone yet. I think it was a concept released a year later or so, and the quality was definitely not that great!It's really a shame, the anachronisms could easily have been fixed and it would have made the movie so much better. I saw that Besson directed and wrote this movie. I just don't think that's possible. Compare The Professional to this film. Besson would know what tech was or wasn't around back then. There's no way he could have been behind this, but it did feel like one of his movies. Was he just too lazy to fix the script?Don't get me wrong, it's worth watching if you ignore the tech stuff. Some of it is on point, others, laughably no. I don't know if some of the kids working in Hollywood don't understand what people had to do back before smartphones and the internet, but in many situations, you had to forgo calling anyone until you could get to a payphone or a business that would let you use their phone. Just being lazy and writing in cellphones to get the shot is awful.",Anna
106,movieman6-413-929510,Luc Besson seems to copy his own work in a lesser way.,4,20 August 2019,"Anna is a new action thriller directed, written and partly produced by Luc Besson, the director of The Fifth Element, Léon: The Professional and Lucy.In the film, Anna Poliatova (Sasha Luss) is discovered by a model scout, which makes her breakthrough in the international fashion world. In addition to her beauty, Anna also has unique powers and skills that make her one of the
make the world's most feared secret agents. For example, she must use her skills to eliminate criminal who pose a threat.With this film it almost seems as if Luc Besson has made a remake of one of his own older films. This film, for example, looks a lot like his films Nikita and Léon: The Professional only in a modern twist.
Another problem with this film is that, in addition to being original, the story is not told chronologically. Due to the many title cards that indicate that another time leap is made in the story to the past, the future or back to the present, the story remains difficult to follow. With the time jumps in the story he tries to make a point of explaining about, but due to the many time jumps you no longer know exactly what certain events were about.The action scenes are entertaining in this film, but not all action scenes seem equally credible. Some action scenes seem a little too acted and choreographed to her. This is because for Sasha Luss this role is only her first lead in a film. For this she only had a cameo in Luc Besson's film Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets. Furthermore, Sasha Luss has not acted in films in her career and is otherwise only known as a model from Russia.
Better acting work comes from the other cast members. Luke Evans and Cillian Murphy play their roles better, but the unclear story sometimes makes it difficult to keep track of their characters and actions.",Anna

No wonder he demonstrates in his shooting that he is an very experienced spy film director.If you are the viewers who demand everything to be authentic, especially whether the use of computer and phone are actually of the age of the story, and whether a super model could possibly kill whole lots of men alone, I advise you not to see the movie. True, it is unrealistic. For me, however, as long as the storyline is reasonable and it is entertaining, I would not find fault on the movie.The story is entertaining and audience-friendly in the following ways. The actor of Anna is well picked. She is beautiful and stylish. The costume she wears is smart and trendy. Since she likes playing chess, she makes me think of the female lead of the present Netflix heat Queen's Gambit, only that Anna is a much more charming girl. My only complaint on the casting would be choice of her two lovers, who are not handsome enough to be in par with Anna.The fighting choreography is up to standard. I especially like his arrangement to repeat some scenes in order to show the behind scenes. This is friendly to the audience, so we will be always in catching with the intriguing story.I confess that I have not watched many spy movies and I would not compare Anna with the rest heats.

That could have been done in 5-minutes. Sasha Luss is a very good actress and along with Helen Mirren both command the screen. Keep in mind that Olga (Mirren) is always suspicious of Anna. You'll see.What we will see - in time - is a LUCY, NIKITA and shades of JOHN WICK as well. Really excellent choreography in the shootings and hand-to-hand battles. Anna will become a female John Wick so to speak. Ha!What we will also see are some hits that will be replayed exactly as they happened and not as we saw them the first time. So be prepared for that.Anna doesn't like doing what she does, but it is the only way to gain her freedom and she needs to find a way to make sure that happens. Here you might start thinking of a twist.Notables: Lera Above as Maud, Anna's girlfriend, but we see nothing happening between them; Eric Godon as the top KGB General Vassiliev.The story starts to get really good when the CIA confronts Anna and they get her to work for them.

116,PetarNeo,Anna (Léon): The Professional or not?,7,20 June 2019,"After 25 years, we are presented with new insight into Luc's world of action and espionage that will take bumpy rides, maybe not always go as planned but it is a journey worth sticking and giving attention.
Anna, starts as an innocent movie and twists us onto its paths that lead all over and back and forward. It's set in time where KGB and CIA are operating at peak level and hauls our main character Anna into its world. Maybe it will end where you imagined it going or maybe it will go totally different way but you'll have to stick to the end to witness it and there will definitely be different opinions on movie and how it turned out.
Now Anna has a lot to offer some decent choreographed action scenes as far as going to replicate most recent action movies in quiet same fashion but this time putting female protagonist. Anna (Sasha Luss) gives a pretty amazing performance considering this to be her first big movie we may be interested seeing more from her in future. Other leads that follow her like Mr. Evans, Mr. Murphy and Mrs. Mirren are pretty good touch to movie and expose their talents on screen that we may not seen yet.
Idea behind movie looks familiar if you start to compare it to recent action thriller movies and there is question is it necessary to ask yourself, Do we really need another movie like this? As it turns out it has a lot to offer plot wise and as acting goes but when it goes into directing it gets really choppy and there are moment when you wonder is it the same man directing the whole movie. Predictability that lies behind the movie can't be forgotten because you might find yourself in position where you figure a lot stuff before it happens and it can be annoying.
All in all it goes from interesting ride to boring one and then again into interesting which will put you in seat for a ride that will potentially satisfy you at the end. Action scenes are something to appreciate and plot turns and twists that will take you at many places. 2.5/4",Anna
117,LukeCustomer2,At least there was no woke messaging,5,17 April 2020,"But it wasn't a great movie. First there are timeline problems. When a movie cuts back and forth through time so much the audience needs assistance figuring out where we are in time... well... to top that off the movie opens with a large scene of, you might think, something central to Anna's story, but no, in the end it was kind of a minor point. Actually might have worked better if it was only told about, not seen.In addition there is a woke problem in that they have Anna take out a restaurant full of large men. We are talking 30+. That is just straining credulity. Anna is not physically enhanced is she? No she is just a 90 lb model who does not have eyes in the back of her head. I understand the need for bigger and bigger action pieces but we are officially at an end to that. Interest must be found another way. Hollywood stop pretending the laws of physics do not apply.Finally it is another one of those movies that only exists to (about every 45 minutes) tell you what you think was happening -- wasn't -- and then tell you how it was happening. But wait? Was it really happening that way?... dun dun.. God enough. It is just a cheap trick on the audience at this point. The phrase subverting exceptions applies.Finally the main actress it not convincing. To mean every moment on the screen looked as if she was acting. Hard. I never felt like anything got to her... or like there was capable intelligence back there. She was more like a robot who occasionally cried.",Anna
118,Lewis_Heather787,Welcome surprise !,7,27 June 2019,"In recent times there has been some trepidation when you see Luc Besson's name attached to a film, some his latest films haven't been great. Fortunately we can all rest easy because this film was a definite welcome surprise in terms of acting, story and overall entertainment.There are three main positives for me personally that make me give it a positive review on the whole.Sasha Luss who are you? Where on earth did you come from? Until upon watching this film I had not heard of her........off the top of my he'd I'm about 95% certain that I've never seen her in anything before............. (just googled her, she's only done two films including this). However that is all about to change because she was simply fantastic in this film as the titular character of ""Anna"". She does everything you expect from a role like this but she delivers so much more than that. Throughout the film she is a chameleon showing us multiple characters within each other. There is ""Anna"", the woman who is down on her luck and hating life really. Then there is ""Anna"" the young woman who wants nothing else but freedom in her life and will do anything to obtain it. Lastly there is also ""Anna"" the incredibly lethal assassin/spy who will achieve a mission no matter the difficulty. Therefore with that all in mind its actually a more complex role than you first think, Sasha Luss embodies them all perfectly..........simply incredible. Can't wait to see what she does next! Best female lead performance in 2019????The next big positive is the action/stunt work. At last there is a film that can even be mentioned in the same breath as the ""John Wick"" films in terms of action and stunt work. I was really pleased and over the moon at the level of skill and brutality involved in the action scenes. Fast paced, lethal, gory and inventive. Thats the best part is the fact that her weapons of choice could vary from a gun to a plate, genius.The last positive is a mixture because there are parts of the story that I love but I'm not sure in how it was laid out/ presented on screen. The personal story of ""Anna"" herself is really interesting and was hooked onto her character immediately. The ""spying/assassin"" areas of the story are exactly what you want especially when she flips from the KGB to the CIA, nicely done. Overall its interesting, tense and entertaining to watch.However the one negative I have with the film is to do with the story. There are too many shifts in time throughout the film. Now and then it works, like when we first find out Cillian Murphy was tracking Anna all along and recruits her..very well done. Unfortunately it is used a little too much especially at the start of the film, I can completely understand if this puts people off because it could be very confusing.Overall though I really enjoyed the film 75% out of 100 or 7.5 out of 10, a utterly fantastic performance from Sasha Luss in her first real role....how is that possible?? Action/stunt work that can even rival ""John Wick"" and a story that even though can be a bit over complicated it still had me on the edge of my seat. Good spy action entertainment, what a welcome surprise!",Anna

Nothing in this movie makes any sense. This is yet another pathetic attempt of Luc Besson to exorcise his sex fetiches through movie-making. It is clear for anyone with a basic knowledge about 20th century cinema that this guy has made his life-mission to make a woman-fetiche movie even greater than ""Barbarella"". Sadly for him (and for us viewers), he is no Roger Vadim. For the viewer, the only value that can be had is the involuntary comedy: I laughed out loud for more than 75% of the movie's running time. Why? Because this movie is so outrageously ridiculous, the only sane reaction to it is either to laugh or to leave.
The only redeeming quality this movie has is the participation of Hellen Mirren, who is probably the best living actress of our times. It is always a pleasure to see her perform, even in such a pile of crap as this pathetic excuse for a film.",Anna

124,Mivas_Greece,"A very complete espionage film with plenty of action, complicated script with many twists, and a beautiful and tough Luss",7,12 December 2020,"Espionage / action movie. A very well made script with several plot twists until the end, with very good direction, plenty of action and suspense and some experienced actors to support it. The very beautiful and dynamic actress is still in her infancy but she could very well develop into a new Milla Jovovich in the future. A young and smart girl who wants to escape from poverty, misery, but also her aggressive partner, finally finds herself inside the KGB before she realized it. She always seeks for her freedom, but it never comes. She will be among the KGB, CIA, various missions, but also plans of one service for the other. She is brave and very smart, but sometimes events overtake her. A generally complete espionage film with plenty of action, some exaggerations perhaps, but also a complicated script with many twists. A good suggestion for fans of the genre.",Anna
125,somf,Much better than the critics are saying.,8,24 June 2019,"I gave Red Sparrow and Atomic blonde 7s and this an 8. And though all three leads are three of the most beautiful women in the world Sasha Luss is probably the sexiest of the three. She is also the least skilled actress of the three, but fairs by far the best in pulling off the brilliant action scenes choreographed and created by the talented Luc Besson. This is my second favorite film of his next to the Professional.
I have never been into pure martial arts films but I love Asian thrillers like A Bittersweet Life, Oldboy, and The Man from Nowhere, that are known for their great fight scenes. The action scenes in this film reminded me of those films and also the terrifically successful John Wick series. .
Along with the great action is a plot full of clever twists. Unfortunately Besson can only pull the whole story off with a lot of flashbacks and shifts in time that are slightly annoying to follow.
Helen Mirren is fantastic as always and the rest of the cast is uniformly solid. Perfect summer popcorn movie. Why the studio spent about 12 cents in promoting it is beyond me other than the fact that Sasha Luss is no household name. I think it is a film that will be discovered more on cable, which is too bad because the action is best enjoyed on a big screen. Sexy, over the top, extremely violent. Anna is a solid B movie. It is almost certain to develop future Cult status that I hope will elevate the film's success so that Anna 2 is made. Highly recommended.",Anna

She also had enough Charisma to carry the Movie very well as the Title Role.Helen Mirren was also great but in a subdued way, I think this is the best Role I've seen her in Years.

It is so much better than Nikita ,Red Sparrow,Atomic Blonde.
It gives a good backup story to the character, it has really nice fight scenes and a nice plot.
Of course it is not that much believable , I mean this woman besides being a ruthless cold-stoned assassin, she also possesses the strength of 20 men and unbelievable luck (she never gets shot, she never gets tortured) and also she can get away with everything by sleeping with different people.
Also the only thing in the movie that suggests that we are in the Soviet era are the lada cars. That is pretty much it. Everything else shows technology that arrived at least a decade later. And Ismailovsky market is pictured the way it is now. And actually everything.
Ok this is not believable. BUT who decides how believable a movie should be?

With it already being an Espionage Film, It Gave the Movie Even More Gravity as well as a Cool Spy Feel to it.° The Twists were Expected but were Good and I didn't expect a Certain Twist.° Helen Mirren does a Good Job in the Movie.With Espionage films there is only a certain amount of components you can pull from to make a good movie and for what this Movie produced I would say it did really well.",Anna

Oh, and one thing that WAS hard to swallow (and disappointing) - the beautiful military & KGB trained agent twice was handed a pistol for a mission and failed to check the clip & weapon both times.Key with any film is casting of the lead and the otherworldly looking Sasha Luss is an eye magnet for sure but also has screen presence and (in this role) is very good.I did kind of expect a signature Luc Besson rocket launcher scene, but the amazing fight choreography made up for it.

A torn noun to fit any movie any person likes instead of characterising just a few cases where plot, casting, cinematography, soundtrack are perfect.Certainly this one is not the case.Pluses: very realistic scenario and execution. Could easily become a female spy franchise leaving James Bond a man. Nice depiction of 80s and 90s.Minuses: I didn't like the protagonist. Maybe truly fit for the role, but I didn't see her doing any expression except incredible flatness during 2hours. You might say this was why she was the perfect spy, but I still won't like.
Too many flashbacks, more annoying than in Arrow TV series. Director used it to make the big u-turns all the time. Until the end.

150,Wililjam,The unnecessary relationships were unnecessary...,7,14 September 2019,"There were a few good things about this movie, and some really bad ones. Since I'm a quite the pessimist, let's start with the bad things about this movie:The unnecessary relationship. Anna and a model is in a relationship for the whole movie, basically, yet we see no actual scenes that would make us believe that they are in a relationship. They have absolutely ZERO chemistry whatsoever, and it feels extremely forced.Sasha Luss' acting. What didn't make the unnecessary relationships better is the fact that Sasha Luss didn't act like she was even a little bit into it. Her performance was fairly wooden at times, especially in the scenes with the model.The editing. They went back and forth in time too many times. They should've started with Anna being with her boyfriend, and then getting recruited, and then follow the movie as it was. Instead it made a cut in the middle of it all and we follow her backstory a little, to find out how she is where she is etc. But that's just my opinion.Now to the positives I guess:Sasha Luss' fight scenes. They were pretty good actually, almost as good as the John Wick ones. The restaurant fighting scene were particularly good.Helen Mirren. She is always a win in my opinion.The plot twists. Even though I had a few issues with the editing, I was surprised about some of the plot twists, especially in the second act. In the third act it was fairly obvious what was going to happen, but it was good nonetheless.Do I think this is a perfect movie? Of course not. If I could have, I would've given the movie a 6.5/10. However, I did like it. It was good enough to watch. I've seen some people commenting that it's just like 'Nikita', and to be honest, I haven't seen that movie. So maybe that's why I liked it more than some. If you want to watch something and there's nothing on the TV, watch this, or don't.",Anna

It doesn't have long takes but isn't choppy like Jason Bourne. It is very well acted as well. There are few very good not so predictable twists but also few predictable ones.I haven't seen the lead actress Sasha Luss anywhere but she has done wonderful job.

154,AleksandrBelenko,It is a mess,5,30 July 2019,"I want to be fair. From the plot view it is a mediocre movie. First half is a boring sequence, it gets better and the end is really good. I did not like flashbacks. Whole movie consists of acts and then flashbacks with explanations. It could be good once or twice but all the way it is a swing from one point in time to the past and back to present. It annoyed me a lot. I enjoyed seing Russian actors playing Russians, that speak Russian. (I know, a lot of ""Russian"" in one sentence.) But then the main characters, who suppoused to be Russians just speak Wngkish with each other. So why bother showing to the viewers legit Russians then? And finally, modern technology in late 80's? Moreover in USSR? Luc Besson lives in parallell universe, where random Russian dude has Mercedes and laptop? And everyone has mobile phones? Yes, they are old phones, but they appeared post-Soviet era, not during USSR, especially in that country....

155,angiris,Interesting concept ruined by bland character and way too much flashback sequencing.,5,27 June 2019,"Movie summarized:Bland. Very bland.Explanation / analysisFilm's basicically Salt / Red Sparrow mixed together in various ways which could in a way sound interesting except the film decides to show you too much, which has it dragging on with too many flashback sequences that last too long and ultimately make the film feel boring.This is a particular problem because it spends so much time establishing the characters past over...and over, that it ends up taking away from the actual present. Rushing through what could've been interesting action minus 1 scene.The best actors in the film feel underused and ultimately we're just stuck with this... bland ""protagonist"" if you can call her that.Very emotionaless, pale and meh. And I get that its intended, I just find it incredible boring to look at.And thats it. If you're into these kinds of films, more power to you .I personally find it insulting that people are comparing this so blatantly to Nikita who was infinitely more interesting.
I see the Salt plot, I see the Red Sparrow training. I see the total lack of emotion and dreary feel from both.But thats all I see. And it lowers what would've been a 6 out of 10 film to 5 in my book.
Because I genuinely couldn't even be bothered to finish it, due to how bored I was. I felt like I was wasting time.The most criminal part of the film is how it starts. It throws everything at you. Right in your face and then... flashback. After flashback. And overly long sequences of telling you everything that lead up to this moment except its boring.Final thoughtsI like Luc Besson as a director but christ is this one of his weaker works.5 out of 10. Go watch Salt instead. Angelina actually has charm and comes across as convincing in her portrayal as a soviet agent. She has heart, Anna here feels like a rushed version of multiple characters without much soul.And to anyone comparing her to John Wick... Shame on you.",Anna

And the first USB flash drive appeared in late 2000, how come they have a USB dongle in 1990?)Other than that it was a good spy movie with lot of actions, impossible fights and actions but at this point we don't care anymore.8/10 stars for the action movie and negative -5/10 (5 below zero) stars for unbelievable lack of knowledge and not caring about the 80s and 90s tech, we are not stupid!",Anna

163,helenbassett,"Anna Film Review - Luc Besson Directs Spies, Sex, Supermodels And Sisters Doing It For Themselves",9,24 July 2019,"Luc Besson has a track record of using models as actors and in Anna he recruits Russian model Sasha Luss in the starring role. And she can handle a gun just as well as a pair of spike heels.Anna is a story that takes us from the 80's of a ruthless Russia where CIA operatives are forcibly repatriated back to the US by Eric Godon's KGB Head, Vassiliev, to the bright lights of a Paris fashion model agency. And walking the catwalk, after being picked up from a life of drugs and abuse by Luke Evans KGB operative Alex Tchenkov is Anna. Helen Mirren's KGB handler Olga is unsure about the new recruit, but Anna's first result was pretty impressive. And we do like a bit of carefully choreographed mayhem. Although Vassiliev warns Anna the only way out of the KGB is with a gun. Anna understands all too well.The modelling shows the rough end of a glamorous lifestyle but Anna is always dressed to kill. And she makes the most of the opportunity. Bagging a gorgeous girlfriend and although not looking quite as good as Angelina Jolie did in Mr & Mrs Smith, when dressed in her lingerie, no-one ever will!, but good enough, she walks a fine line between catwalk and assassin. And attracting the attention of Cillian Murphy's CIA operative Lenny Miller. It's the way she carried her bag. Lenny is understandably sore over the operatives being returned from Russia under his watch, and he would like to play the Russians at their own game.Of course this is all filmed by Besson in the past to the present and back again, so he keeps us on our toes as to where we are in the plot line. Quite clever actually and we get it.And among the testosterone of our CIA and KGB operatives, Anna can handle herself, bed them both, and check mate them all. To be honest I haven't seen Luc's La Femme Nikita, but Anna zipped along quite happily with a great cast and Anna and Olga getting the job done to their mutual satisfaction. Unlikely sisters doing it for themselves. But always make sure you have a back-up plan.A fun action hook-up.",Anna

167,Exiled_Universe,An OK action and spy movie but still has major problems.,8,25 September 2019,"So when i saw the trailer i thought it was gonna be great and on the same level as john wick and atomic blonde and my expectations were very high. Then i watched some reviews and i heard that there were only 2 action scenes and that really brought my hopes down and i lost pretty much all faith but i kept telling myself you never know with stuff like this. So im here and i just saw it and i dont really know what to say. Let me start off with there was way too many sex scenes and the main character banged at least 7 people and there was like 10 sex scenes with no nudity but still very unnecessary. Also i saw the restaurant fight scene on you tube and it was like 1 minute and 30 seconds but when i saw the movie it was longer than that and it was extended so that made me happy and it was also very cool seeing it on the big screen. The other escape scene near the end was ok and i can say that that part was cool. Other than that there was some shootings here and there but other than that there was just people talking and spy's changing outfits and doing jobs and double agents which is something im not into im just into the action like the restaurant part. But i can respect that thats what the director wanted to do with this movie and there was really only one trailer for this movie and it didn't have much of a boost off the start of the launch but it was OK after all and was very similar to atomic blonde and this movie is basically the daughter of it, a one time watch for sure but you should watch it once as well.",Anna

I would say Riley North of Peppermint for its shear real grittiness 'John Wick' style action. She gets badly beaten up horribly stabbed, does ""Firstblood"" style self repair. The type of person you would not meet with in a dark alley way. Then there's the Atomic Blonde side again good stunts.
There is always this redemption situation.
Anna is like RedSparrow, yet Hannah's the niche between them.Anna is another rehash of Anne Parillaud's Nikita, it's been done and done and done again.

Like Nikita again Anna is deceived by her own boss on her first mission again both in a restaurant. this time no bullets in her gun as opposed to the bricked up escape route in Nikita.
Again she wants to escape her job. But unlike Nikita, Anna is like the terminator 'unstoppable.'
In this movie Anna's life has twists and turns she takes on both the CIA & KGB and plays them making them look foolish. But as we see she still has KGB interests at heart. Good to see that in a movie, rather than always being the USA as the victor like in many movies. The ending was a great twist, it looks left open for a continuation.",Anna

And even in Paris I don't think that in 1988 in even rich hotel they store video data on hard drives looks like my 10 mb hard drive from IBM 286. And its not that Anna can't feel some paper forms... why she even need notebook? Or why they so need to take not less then cell phone from a gangster in Glavpivtorg, when just paper telephone book was okay? Luc Besson have marasmus or something? He don't remember how 1988 year look? And they have bunch of russian actors two, who probably laugh out of their asses, but don't say a word to the creators of film.

Ridiculous fight scenes, so stupid it is not even comical. Skinny nonathletic model as an assassin, really, what a joke! Was there any plot? Complete mess of a film with no pacing as if scenes were randomly glued together with scotch. Boooring crap! Besson should retire, although there are always idiots who love garbage.

Working around limitations, clever is more interesting than brute force, this is why female agents were historically honey traps, instead they take it to the absurd and have her pistol headshot people like a machine gun while taking on squads of male soldiers in arm to arm combat.

Yes, there's plenty of action and yes, the main actress is hot, but where his other movies seem to shine (apart from the action sequences, awesome musical scores and outrageous costume department) is the dialogue and chemistry between the characters. Another reviewer wrote that this movie seems to be directed by more than one person. I totally agree. While there's flashes of Luc Besson's touch here and there, the majority of the movie seems disjointed, as if the directed didn't know where he was going with this movie and decided to let an understudy have the reins for half of it.

The twists and turns throughout made it an enjoyable experience, as well as the action sequences, and the story.
Speaking of the story and the use of mobile phones, why use them at all? And why not substitute the phone she has to take for microfilm or a classified folder, Something believable for the time?

I really like the story and everything who says, it is bad and predictable is just a big liar who can""t imagine new generation watch a movie who get the nikita style in 2020.It is not a bad idea from Luc Besson to redo a fantastic movie 30 years later, this way perhaps the young watcher can identify them self more easily with this one.anyway a good 7/10 for me",Anna

The plot was convoluted with flashback after flashback, but not too confusing that you couldn't follow. It just muddied the story a bit.

Not really.For starter, the story isn't something new. And around the time this movie was released we had similar theme in Atomic Blond or Red Sparrow. You could also say this also feels like John Wick-ish.But overall the story is good, the pacing is good, the action is top notch, the acting are great. Sasha Lush did wonderful job playing as badass spy disguised in model clothing. She's the kind of heroine that you'll support from the beginning to the end.And I can't help but think this should be Black Widow origin story. Secret agent with special skill. How they were trained and how they escape the organization.If you like movie with good twist in the end. Fast pace action with espionage seasoning. This is your movie.

It is a variation of the countless similar representations of the same plot. The difference is the execution. It is clear in this case that the direction relies on the charm of the protagonist, the ""femme fatale"" which leads men left and right, deceives agencies and manipulates events.

247,ronin1138,"Leon, it ain't...",3,10 September 2019,"Luc Besson movies are easy to spot in terms of story and style in that there is much style and only a basic outline of a story / male fantasy. In 1994 Luc made one of the greatest action films ever made in Leon, it is just brilliant. There is not one thing that makes it so great as certainly the story is basic and it is very stylish and does have great actors playing memorable characters. Maybe the reason is its simply better paced, the film takes its time and lets the viewer enjoy it instead of like Anna rushing to action scene after action scene. The story actually had heart to, something that has been lacking in every one of his films since, now he makes films that are pretty but do not engage. I do like his work but god almighty I want the Besson back who made Leon. Sometimes a directors best work is when they have a much smaller budget, just look at James Cameron and Ridley Scott.It seems in this film he is trying to recapture the lightening of Leon but it feels more like a vanity project.

252,Dusan_Indjic-Luigi,Modern (=quick) action for younger,6,11 September 2019,"Unlike many others IMDB reviewers, I'll skip the (in most other reviews mentioned) obvious timing, revamping/redoing, realism, etc. incorrectness, and try to see it from a new generations point of view. Meaning: wouldn't mind the above mentioned (incl. likes of history or politics) aspects - well known (not necessarily) to our older generation. I simply pretend to see this stuff for the first time.
To be concise and skipping the detailed approach, it's generally medium-plus quality production. I give it credit for a few things (as said, seeing it through younger public's eye): quick pace adjusted for just mentioned public and well done approach to that thin border in violent action scenes in between realistic martial arts and fiction. Also, there's this (realistically adjusted, must say) contemporary, rush and global story approach to ever more fast moving ""uni-metered"" geography, with actual (though content-shallow, maybe even for younger) story line and it's twists. Nice scene/photography, colorful eye candy. But certainly not deep, indeed.",Anna
253,luningyuan-23687,"When the whole KGB is speaking English, that's how the Soviet Union failed",5,9 July 2019,"This summer, Luc with his new movie ANNA back to the cinema. After the failure of Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets, which has massive investment and a not optimistic return, this movie will decide Luc's next few years fate of creating.
According to various reviewers' review, apparently that Anna won't be their match. The worst thing is that only 3 shows a day in the cinema where I lived nearby. And that cinema has 15 screens.
Low score and low showing rate are enough to kill a movie. But how is this movie? Really that bad? Actually the whole story is quite fascinating. If you familiar any other Luc's works, you will know his films usually be underestimated. His special French style narrative skills does not very feed the American reviewers' taste, but that can't he is bad at directing or writing.
Anna, this movie with a great story and marvellous camera, every second is beautiful, superb. The nasty thing is the time-shifting structure. Luc used time-shifting to set twists and surprise the audience, makes the audience could not guess what is the next in the film. However, when the whole movie is based on the time-shifting to narrate the story, making unpredictable into predictable. On the one hand, the audience waiting for the next twist, on the other hand, the audience tired of the twist and wish it stop.
Overview of the whole movie, the first half hour of this film is could be too slow, comparing what will happen next, the first three chapters really not fit in this film. Twice in that half hour makes me want to press the forward button. But once you calm down and keep watching it, the next few chapters will WOW you.",Anna
254,e-88714,Surprisingly fresh and entertaining spy's movie,8,17 September 2019,"The story told in the film takes place in an alternative reality (presumably the middle of the 90s). In this world, the Soviet Union has not disappeared from the world map but represents a formidable communist force opposing the United States. KGB agents are used for the dirtiest work - murders of all kinds.The fate of a little girl Anna, who is forced to become a professional killer, may not interest you if you have already read a few negative reviews of this film. But let's be honest. I'm not a big fan of Luke Besson, but I admit that the movie was successful (this is the most modest thing we can say about it).The critics' main claims are related to the presence of laptops and cell phones in the KGB agents in the early 90s. Meanwhile, we have a huge number of films where no one asks such questions. A fresh example concerns the film ""Captain Marvel"" where no one is interested in how a girl can burn a concrete wall with her fist and move spacecraft from one place to another. Okay, I see no reason why I should be worried about ThinkPad laptops and Motorola's cell phones with KGB agents in 1991 if I'm watching an entertaining movie. Let's go back to Anna.Obviously, the movie has failed in the box office for the reasons we've sorted out above, but I swear to you - the 30 million euros spent on this movie is the best investment in entertainment movies I've ever seen. We got a fresh spy action movie with detective elements, in the best traditions of Agatha Christie.If you are prepared for some of the problems of the fantastic spy world that Luke Besson created, I guarantee you will enjoy watching it.",Anna
255,geislekm,Surprisingly strong,9,13 February 2020,"I went to this movie expecting essentially a remake of La Femme Nikita, and although there are some elements that mirror that movie, the acting is quite good, Sasha Luss in particular.

3 month before. 6 moth later. etc.As always a great cast and production team. Including Serra as Score composer. A perfect match since decades.
Luc Besson thrillers are a class of his own and this is one of his best.
Action, Ironie, French slapstick. Suspense. He can write story's, dialogue and frame then into significant pictures.

The joyless have such a need to brag that they've forgotten how to just watch a movie and be entertained for about 90 minutes. Can't blame them, there hasn't been a half-decent vampire or undead movie for a while.
Don't let them ruin this for you.
This latest Besson outing is a good cloak and dagger action feature with a fair dose of humor, twists and flashbacks thrown into the mix.The bodycount is high but without the excess gore and grunting or the gratuitous sex. Female assassins are usually more sophisticated.The most bloody scene was the model Anna M beating up a self-absorbed fashion photographer and frankly, that alone was worth the price of admission.Helen Mirren was her usual class act and if it's any endorsement, she never backs a lemon.Go see this but leave the critic in you at the ticket counter and just enjoy the movie.",Anna

First, when the movie started, I thought oh what a drag.

She turns out to be a highly talented and trained killer caught up between the CIA and the KGB trying to get a way out of it. In order to succeed she needs an extreme cunning plan and a meticulous execution. Brilliant action scenes, nice sex scenes although she never gives a view of the goods.

I don't really see that anything is new, except that younger generations don't look at ""old"" (> 20 years) films. Judging by the cars, this must be set around 2000.That said, the lead was effective, beautiful in a string-bean model way (all legs, boyish body, gorgeous head), and there were solid actors (Mirren, Luke, and Murphy) but the characters were two-dimensional apart from the lead.The fantasy bit comes from the Law of Physics defying action sequences, the invariably accurate shooting of the lead combined with the poor aim of others. At least, the lead's hair and complexion showed some signs of combat after a battle.To me, this is simply a ""milking of a cow"", with the introductions of a gazelle-like actress with at least an ability to go from tortured, depressed young woman to an impassive killers, who can dispatch 25 people in one swoop, yet, is supposed to be the object of the audience's sympathy.",Anna

However what is his fixation with actresses who are told that they are way more beautiful than most women; only to have their personalities distract from anything that they were lucky enough to be born with. I kept hearing every character in this film refer to ANNA as this woman all men want. Really? What is so seducing? Beyond the fact that when she keeps her mouth shut she is not ugly; what is so alluring? Her and the main actress in Valerion are two women I would want to spend zero time with. Let alone two hours in a goofy over the top non realistic spy film.,Anna

But watching those fight scenes makes one wonder if they decided to toss out the laws of physics and replace them with laws of Hollywood Heroins the 90lbs female that can kick the heck out of 50 armed 250lbs men and still walk away.

It was pretty dire, and I've had a stomach full of stoic, Poe faced Russian/american 90 lb super models having the capacity to kill 15 men, whilst armed only with crockery. The wizzing back and fourth of timelines was hugely distracting, and became laughable around the fifth time it happened. It was only when I came on here that I learned this was supposed to be set in the 80's?! Well, you could have fooled me. Perfect cameras and remarkable surveillance footage were obviously available in Russia at that time. This has been done a million times but in the case of Hanna, was done a million times better. This is so similar to that mess that Jennifer Lawrence was in, husky voiced sultry sulky Russian babes that outsmart men, because the ladies can do stuff now.

A rail-thin woman who MAYBE weighs 110 fully clothed, tossing around highly trained male bodyguards is ridiculous. Maybe if it were 1 or 2 she shot, but 10+ being repeatedly thrown around and knocked out cold by a tiny woman..hahaha...nothing else to do but laugh.

All of the supporting cast are not developed characters, just figurines. Helen Mirren is always good and Luke Evans plays a solid role. Today, it's much more difficult to believe that a super skinny chick can take out 10 guys in hand to hand. The least they could have done was have Luss bulk up a little.It's mostly cheap action and bedroom scenes. The action scenes are boring and over-used comic book sequences. We already know she's gonna knock em all down or dead.

292,gpcheng87,"Honeytrapped by Helen, Luke and Cillian, more like.",4,17 November 2019,"Oh, dear.From first glance this looked questionable, but when I saw Helen Mirren, Luke Evans, and Cillian Murphy in the trailer I thought I might be wrong (Luc Besson is less of a solid bet than these 3, in my humble opinion). Other reviews said ""good action"" so, hey, why not.Here's why not: As other watchers have reported in the Goofs section, this movie is rife with lack of attention to detail. The flipping back and forth through time in the begining is lazy storytelling; it doesn't add anything to the story which made it unnecessary and confusing. Opening scene >> 3 years ago >> 3 years later >> 6 months ago... What is this, ""The Time Machine 2: Trapped in the 20th Century""? Next, the script is awful. It's disjointed and unnatural and strange yet predictable. I almost feel sorry for Evans and Murphy - they look pained or bored and resigned every time they open their mouths and I don't blame them. I guess I'm not surprised; dialogue in ""Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets"" also had me rolling my eyes. The pacing is also off, with no character development and huge plot gaps. Men seem to just care for/help Anna, even though she's not supposed to stand out, either as a spy or as one model in a sea of models. The immediate/sudden attraction or fixation she inspires makes every male character in the movie seems either lecherous or naïve, which makes them boring, 2D caricatures we don't care about as an audience. Other parts of the movie ask us to stretch the boundaries of our belief and logic; I audibly groaned when I saw the small square package being delivered to Murphy's character before the main actress even appeared on screen. It was so obviously a head, and so not believable that it would have made it into the building, much less to the desk of a CIA handler/upper management, even in 1985 (one word: x-ray; even something that couldn't be identified would have been opened to be inspected, especially with the mail of a CIA agent working on Russian missions. Russia/the KGB have been suspected of numerous assassinations and attempted assassinations using poison, from powders and acids to radiation before and during the 1980s/when this movie is set). The only believable part was Murphy's reaction - in what hell indeed did this get in here? A beautiful woman covered in blood running into the snowy whitw streets from a busy restaurant isn't spotted by anyone in a city full of cameras? A female chessmaster who can quote plays and speaks 5 languages with a military father and military training doesn't know how to slit her wrist correctly? The only other thing worth mentioning here is that Evans' Russian accent is inescapably bad. Having seen him in many other things I doubt it's his fault; probably not a lot of time or support to prepare, made worse by the foil of an actual native Russian speaking English (main actress Sasha Luss). Evans sounded Scottish or Irish at times, but mostly like himself with an faux-Russian twist in 1/3 of the words in a sentence (again, giving him the benefit of the doubt because he's great at what he does). Dame Mirren's delivery was much more natural, but it also seemed to play/add to this strange underlying trope of the beautiful femme fatale that men find irresistible. As a woman, Mirren is immune to the protagonist's magical charms and subsequently, a more interesting character. Definitely one with more backstory and development than Evans' or Murphy's characters, but that just takes me back to my third point from earlier and since I'm a little time travelled out, I'll stop here.Verdict: Pass.",Anna
293,goudelock,Sasha Luss killing it and Besson knows exactly what he does.,6,19 July 2019,"Despite Anna is like a movie with an old fashioned cinematic style, Luc Besson has the charisma to make beautiful things even if the materials he have in his hands isn't powerful as at Leon the Professional and Nikita.
Sasha Luss is the real superstar of this movie with her simple and cold acting performance that gives what the role asks about.
Besson's screenplay has a lot of problems and one of this is the flashback and time travel thing, but in conclusion Anna gives exactly what it promises and did not deserve at all this bad reviews.",Anna
294,valmont1702,"Anna, badass but layered (as is the whole movie). An unexpected & fun ride, with some very cool action !",8,18 July 2019,"This movie is much more layered and well-crafted than it seems at first sight. Lots of scenes and the way they are shown (during the first 1/3 of the movie, even almost the first half), don't look like a big deal. But the more you walk the meanders of this movie and peel its skin, layer after layer... Then you start to realize, little by little, that it's quite an inceptive mise en abyme ; with clever reveals and cunning twists & turns, offered to our very eyes by a back-and-forth process of successive flashbacks & flashforwards that are skillfully lead (thanks to the directing, screenplay and editing). It's not at all a gratuitous sleight of hand, but the beating heart and vehicle of the whole piece. Because each new sequence (regardless of the time when it takes place) is a new organic (small) step toward the awareness of the how and the why ! And what seemed phoned or weird at first sight, appears to be much more. So, the order in which the informations are revealed gives all the substance to the story. A pretty methodic film in its conception.Now, about the emotion, the acting, and the action ...
There are some really exhilarating and satisfying moments !!
The newcomer Sasha Luss, clearly gives her best dedication in the lead role of Anna, who is haunted by numerous demons and seeks a way out, a ""breath of fresh air"". And you see her fighting (both physically & mentally) all through the trajectory that is pictured in this movie. The supporting roles are excellent : Helen Mirren (evidently) is the standout, she completely disappears inside this cold/deadpan/bitter-tasting but three dimensional character who seems not to be. While Luke Evans & Cillian Murphy both bring us spot-on & in finesse performances.To finish with... The cherry on the cake : The action/fight sequences ...
They are on par with pretty much everything that is done very well in modern movies. In particular, this scene (we had seen a glimpse of it in the trailer) in the restaurant ! It has a great pace, it's creative and very striking. There are some other pretty cool action scenes here and there (like the one that is around the end).Also, I would like to give a very honorable mention to the soundtrack/score. Because there are some excellent pieces of music that bring the precise emotion that's needed in every specific scene ; with a few of them (tracks) that carry you higher emotionally.A tale about a badass (but tormented) femme fatale, like Luc Besson knows so well how to depict ...",Anna
295,snktrss,Pretty decent,7,19 September 2019,"If you've got nothing else to watch and want to be entertained, this is a good flick to take in. It's Nikita and Red Sparrow rolled into one. At first it seemed implausible to me, but why? A model turned actress happens all the time, only this one is playing an assassin. Maggie Q looks no different than her and played Nikita on TV, but since she's Asian it makes sense to most. I enjoyed the jumps in this film because I knew the minute it happened, there's the twist! That excited me. Sasha made me believe she was truly an assassin. I don't know her in anything else, much less modelling...I got to watch her portray this character unbiased. Okay, Luc got the technology, along with some of the materials used in the film for the time period wrong, but that's the only reason this didn't get more stars. Definitely rewatchable.",Anna

I got the feeling it's trying to be smart but overdid those plot twists. But the scenes still flowed and you can follow the story for the most part.Don't expect non-stop action or tense build-up/planning for each action sequence. It's no James Bond or John Wick, but still entertaining. The long fight in the restaurant shown in the trailers is the best fight, one of two major action scenes. There were a few comedic scenes where the movie doesn't take itself too seriously.I didn't care too much about the characters including Anna. She's always shown to be brooding, serious, and just wanting to a peaceful life while being a cold killer doing jobs for what she's promised.

Even the femme fatale fantasy, Atomic Blonde, provided more believable fight scenes. Watching a lightweight and non-muscular KBG agent destroy dozens of Red Army soldiers without receiving even a minor bruise might be humorous, if it wasn't presented with such banal seriousness (the same problem with John Wick 2 & 3).A sad waste of the acting talents of Helen Mirren and Cillian Murphy.",Anna

Even the use of mobile phones was somewhat controversal, since there was no mobile service at that time, but let's accept it was available only for KGB.On the other hand, all KGB facilities were very very authentic. The atmosphere was so well relayed that I could smell the air in it and feel all the analog technology from back then. Fighting sequences were exelent. Much more realistic than almost any chick action flick which appeared recently. What I like most is the wittyness and constant twists.Yes, I know that covering the plot holes would bring even more joy, but for me the acting was on very high level which covered most of them.

As does this one.Yes, Sasha is stunning, there's just something in those Russian genes I guess. Her acting, however, is far less spectacular.

Flashbacks in this film is really unnecessary. It felt more like some scenes are just filler.

It took your average spy movie and threw in so many twists and turns it kept you guessing the entire time. Great writing, casting, directing, producing, and acting by all involved.
My only advice is... make sure you have the time to watch this action packed thriller without interruption. If you pay attention to the entire movie, you will not be let down with the results. I'm hoping they make a sequel. And if you didn't like it, watch it again. Because you missed something along the way.I gave an 8/10 because it was my first time watching it. If I watch it again and enjoy it the same or better, I'll rate 9/10.
And of course there's always the chance that it falls into the 2X or more a year watch list. Only time will tell if this superb movie will follow only a few others on my 10/10 list.
And a little about me.... I'm a HUGE fan of movies and own over 26,000+ blu ray/dvds. And I don't give many reviews. But when I see a movie that's great, and other fans/collectors like myself that I know feel the same way about a certain movie that the BIG movie critics tear down, I feel obligated to give my opinion. There are so many great movies that don't do well at the box office because some critics aren't in the mood for that kind of movie that day, tired, overworked, paid for their opinion, or just just not a true fan of all movies and genres. And because of those critics that have their opinion in print and on tv, many movie goers pass up an opportunity to see a great film on the big screen to find out years later from other fans it was worth the price of admission. And now they can hopefully still see it on their tv at home.I am a MovieFreak!!! Hope you are too!!!",Anna

A pity, but I missed it on the cinemas by the time it was on screens (I just saw it on Amazon Prime). I read some reviews and they were not good at all. I must confide in my instinct more often.

Ugly Pakistani terrorists ? Ben Laden's siblings ? If Lucy had some original material in its script, the one of Anna is as poor as empty. Sasha Luss is pretty. Period. Her character suffers from a total lack of consistency and depth that prevent us to immerse ourselves. Oh! She is not the only problem. The worst is, for sure, Cillian Murphy ! Damned !

318,SenorLengua,Le Femme Anna,7,19 November 2019,"I've been on a femme fetal kick lately, so this was an obvious choice. I really enjoy the woman who kicks ass and takes no names. Atomic Blonde has been a recent multiple times rewatch, Charlize Theron playing a great action hero/spy. Columbiana was also a recent watch, though slightly disappointing and filled with the suspension of disbelief even beyond the great femmes in this category (and the men are not all the better). It is the grit, the rawness, but also the tenderness which I enjoy in these movies, and always have. From Hanna (the Amazon series), which is lacking and Person of Interest (with Shaw, easily a potential stand-alone), to Leon: The Professional, and what I consider the original of this category, La Femme Nikita (the original, not the unfortunate remake staring Bridget Fonda).*Admittedly, I was preparing dinner as I started watching Anna, and had captions turned off. There is quite a bit of Russian, though as I watched it was very obvious the thread from Nikita to Leon to the Fifth Element which made me think it was either a Luc Besson movie, or a very good mimic. If you are familiar with Besson movies, the captions are unnecessary.As for the movie itself, it is fun. Between the spying and action, the movie felt like it was somewhere between an Ian Flemming novel and a John Le Carre novel. There are plenty of twists and turns, but if you are familiar with these types of movies, they are not unexpected and the question is where they will show up. Some were even quite obvious. Still, I did not go into this movie like I did with Red Sparrow, and was not let down by some of the leaps of faith in the story. I also was not expecting Atomic Blonde, and was pleasantly surprised over all. The early fight scene in Anna in the restaurant, though, measures up with the apartment/stairwell fight scene in Atomic Blonde. Not as good to be sure, but still quite inventive if not quite as cohesive. It is enjoyable nonetheless.But this movie really works with the supporting cast of Helen Mirren, Luke Evens and Cillian Murphy, all far more experienced actors than Sasha Luss (Anna). Helen Mirren, of course, is the star playing her part of Anna's handler (Olga) with the excellence we expect of her (though not given enough to be a star). Luke Evans, the Russian (Alex Tchenkov), and Cillian Murphy, the American (Lenny Miller), also hold up their end, with Evans being given more to work with, and doing fairly well with it.All told, this movie is fun and should be taken as serious as The Fifth Element. There are enough twists and thought out moments (I enjoyed that final sit down scene) that anything which is missing (and there is a fair amount) is forgiven.I also must applaud Bessen from avoiding over sexualizing Luss and providing only a brief, silhouetted bare breast. There are a few sex scenes, but the nudity is almost totally absent and had it been there, would have been a distraction.My rating is a 7 based on expectations from the genre and the trailer. It is not an Oscar winning movie, nor is it crap. I recommend for a Friday evening without the kids, with takeout chilling on the couch.* - The martial arts movies of East Asia were deliberately left out.",Anna

I actually slapped my forehead at one moment where she cloned a 21st century hard drive hard drive, wirelessly, in a suitcase from underneath the table!We're used to ludicrous fighting scenes where a reed-thin woman fights her way past tens of huge blokes these days and it's full of nonsense like this too.The more you think about it, the more ridiculous it gets, but it pu;;ls you along just about well enough in the cinema so you don't walk out.Cillian Murphy was good as the CIA agent and there was occasional laughs, and some (hopefully) ironic lines with things like how the Americans are the ""good guys"".All in all, preposterous tosh that if you take your brain out as you enter will keep you entertained.",Anna

That Anna never loved ether Alex Tchenkov or Lenny Miller and that she was actually madly in love with Maude and she should have before CIA bust into hers and Maude's home she should have relieved that she was working for originally KGB and then CIA to assinate Vassiliev. But after Anna gets assurance that her files have been deleted the film should have ended with her and Maude kissing very passionately and then Maude should have reveled that she was British spy working for MI6 and MI6 only intended to step in if Vassilievassassination failed.",Anna

While watching the movie I spent a lot of time petting the cat. This is the only reason I didn't leave the sofa and turned if the movie, that I had a cat to pet.The only good thing about it all was reading the other reweiws and se the lead 'actress' being referd to as 'a noodle' because she is so skinny.

337,CanadianBill,"Not technologically accurate, yet still highly watchable",7,5 August 2021,"In the style of John Wick or Jason Bourne comes Anna, modelesque hand-picked-then-expertly-trained operative, this time on the Soviet side of the international espionage game. The story is immersive, deep and intense, the plot action-filled and with a smattering of sensuality plus a high body count. Anna moves like a steely-eyed cat as she cuts a swath through enemy after enemy, all with the ultimate goal in mind of earning her freedom.If I had to give one main reason why I dropped my rating from an 8 to a 7 it's that while the movie is highly watchable on the story's own merit it is a big ask for the viewer to overlook the numerous instances of use of advanced technology, often years ahead of the time these events supposedly took place.Anna's story deserves an 8, possibly higher. But it is the screenwriter(s) and/or the people responsible for historical accuracy that dropped the ball majorly here.",Anna

You only ruin it for yourself and I think this one was quite enjoyable.",Anna
341,Cosmotron42O,"Decent plot, bad execution and sets.",5,7 April 2021,"Movie was OK. Typical modern low budget flick. The story is actually kind of interesting and gets much better towards the end. The acting is barely good enough to do it justice. Overall, it was actually enjoyable and the concept had a lot of potential. If this was researched better and the sets/costumes were produced better, this would actually be pretty good. As others have pointed out it fails on the ""80s"", and that's pretty much my biggest gripe with it. Out of 10, the story itself would be around an 8, the scripting and acting around a 5, and the set/historical accuracy/production like a 2 at best.Who did their set, costume, and tech design? They should be stabbed like the guy in the movie. As if this movie was made by 16 year olds with zero understanding of history and fashion. In everything from interior design, technology, fashion, behavior it is a joke to market it as an 80s period piece. I suspect they only did this because 80s nostalgia has been around a while now and apparently a good marketing tool. If it only was the 80s. I kind if feel betrayed, lol. Flip phones? Laptops? Orange iMacs? Web video chat? It looks like 2019 with 2019 fashion, except somebody gave them a couple of 1998 iMacs, late 90s flip phones, mid 2000s laptops, and some 2015 clothes. They did get the cars right, though. I don't even know what time period they have recreated! It's literally a cheap, horribly done clusterfu** of visuals and sets. It doesn't know what it is, except for poorly thought out. I couldn't really enjoy it because of this.The fact that it totally blew it visually, there's very little to prop up a cheap plot and scripting. Acting was not the best either, even for a B film, but just sufficient enough for me not to switch it off. I'm glad I didn't, because it actually comes together nicely at the end.. This movie could actually be good if done right, it had good potential in the story. I would recommend it for like a typical worknight movie where you just want to relax and aren't expecting anything super special.",Anna
342,ybissat,Not bad but still not good,5,29 June 2019,"Too much unnecessary love scenes and modelling scenes, you just don't feel connected to any of the characters, everything happens so fast with no character development. Anna kills but we don't know who's the victim or his background, we don't know why she kills most of the time. The actions scenes are fun and not bad, but I still wanted the movie to end fast.",Anna
343,jamayetahmed,Excellent Movie and you should watch this,8,18 September 2019,Before I watch this movie I have seen ratings and I changed my mind not to watch the movie but the trailer made me watch this. After finish the movie I can say it was really a good movie and I loved it. May be its a remake or redo whatever I don't see the original but I really liked it. Many review says its redo and it got bad ratings. I visited most of those profile who gave bad ratings and seen most of the profile gave bad ratings only for this movie and there are no other reviews for any other movie and some are gave very good rating to Hollywood crap movies. Its obvious that most of the bad rating is fake and many movie got so much bad rating though they are really good movies but not made by Hollywood or made by other countries. You know what I mean.,Anna
344,edwardbundy,Just like the others,2,9 August 2020,"No details, no spoilers, just a fact!
Besson is a horrible filmmaker, and knows absolutely nothing about directing actors, or writing believable dialogue.

346,jb-x,Heard it before but definitely not seen it before..,6,2 July 2019,"From the trailer, you may think the Russian Spy concept is a tired one and that this would be a very predictable film. However, the dismantling and rearranging of the narrative gives this film a strong edge over others of this genre and revels lots of intricacies and plot twists along the way, embodying the concept of a Russian Doll. Sasha Luss embodies confidence and female empowerment into the character of Anna, which gives the film that feel good factor that we desire. Not only is there action and suspense, but many unexpected moments of comedy, particularly from Helen Mirren who channels elements of Miranda Priestly from The Devil Wears Prada.
Overall, this is a well constructed film with a tight concept that covers multiple genres. The only criticism is that some of the action combat scenes are elongated and we occasionally lose some of the suspense and momentum that was built up prior.",Anna
347,llsee,"Not Bresson's Best, but Not Bad Either!",6,16 September 2019,"Rule of thumb for this site; ignore ALL 1, 2, 9 & 10 star reviews. These are all written by someone with an ax to grind, or a total fan-boy! This is not a remake of La Femme Nikita, although Bresson injects some similarity. And there seems to be a lot of complaints about historical accuracy. Wow.. just so you know, radio telephones were a thing in the 80's. In fact they existed as far back as the 40's!I personally like Bresson films. While this is not as fresh or original as Nikita or Leon, it has its moments. It is a pretty decent action drama. The flashbacks are not hard to follow or understand, although there are probably a few more than needed. And Bresson seems to have a fondness for leggy blondes in his later films (see also Angel-A). But overall it is worth watching and you won't be bored.",Anna
348,yinkbling,Guess who unleashed the John Wick in her,9,1 July 2019,"This movie really surpassed my expectation. Anna was simply brilliant and the story-line is very well constructed. I must also commend Sasha's acting as she played her role impeccably well. Practically no dull moment for me. In summary, movie was entertaining, straight the point and had several ""Oh wow"" moments. So if you looking to enjoy a pure action flick, Anna is the ideal movie.",Anna

Violence is what people see these for, right? I think Wick movies are vastly overrated, and this wasn't bad. It's nowhere as good as something like Leon The Professional, because that movie had heart, not just violence. Here, just violence (and some sex), some plot twists, who double-crosses who.

352,justincrunden,Another Classic from Mr Besson,9,2 June 2020,"When I first wondered about watching this I must admit I was fairly sceptical. I had the impression it would be a lightweight bugglegum wannabe spy thriller.Oh how wrong was I.This is how all spy films should be made.Hot as hell female lead, tick.Relentless action and intricate plot, tick.Brutal edge of your seat fight sequences, tick.Awesome transfixing acting from the lead and all the supporting actors, tick, tick and tick.This is a top top spy thriller of the highest order with a great story, unbelievable acting, and an awesome soundtrack that fits just right.Sasha Luss is absolutely perfect in the lead role as a battered woman who becomes this awesome ass-kicking assassin/secret agent. That sentence alone seems proposterous and was one of the reasons I was sceptical to start off. But Luc Besson is a genius because he manages to weave this all together into a completely believable tight-knit thrill-ride where you are completely submerged from start to finish.This could be said to be in a similar vein to Leon, another of Besson's masterpieces but that would not do ANNA the justice it deserves.It is original, sexy, dark and light with a tiny splash of humour and a good dose of what makes a top top spy thriller.This film will surely go down as a classic in the same way Leon did.In Sasha Luss, Besson has unearthed an absolute diamond in the rough.She oozes charisma, sex appeal, humour, bravery, honesty and supreme intelligence. A modern day James Bond but miles miles better in my book.If you've got this far into my review and you still haven't hit play, then I seriously cannot help you, this type of film may not be for you.But for everyone else, enjoy the ride, and be prepared for an exillirating two hours of pure unadulterated Besson at his genius best.",Anna

Not only that version of her life was not so fascinating, being a spy also was keeping her to have a life.
I liked the twists, but some scenes shown to explain the twists, could have been added so the audience tries to guess the plan she is carrying out.
Besides that, also shows how we men fail in what we do best, just because there's a tremendous gorgeous girl in it....Good to watch in a flight without any explicit sex scene.",Anna

The script was garbage; the acting was terrible, and the fighting scenes lacked so much logic.The female lead was so stiff, and the love scene between her and Cillian was just a mess.

I don't think it was an ""awful"" movie as some have claimed but it wasn't memorable. I liked the main character and how she played the role.

383,brillig-2,Disappointing Time Travel Movie,5,22 June 2019,"Let me explain my title. This movie jumps forward and backward in time frequently, with titles like ""3 Months Earlier"" separating the scenes. People in the audience I was in started laughing after about 3 of these jumps. They continue through the whole movie. That was very distracting and doesn't help the film at all. Sometimes the same scene is repeated. The first time you see it you don't know what's going on. The second time you see the very same scene, you have some information you didn't have before, so it comes across differently. That's a device that doesn't really work here.Character development was very poor. You're just as likely to jump into a scene without proper development as not. The music sometimes does not mesh well with what's going on on screen.Overall, I got the impression that this movie was a compilation of notes/sketches for what the movie really should be, as if it just passed round one of editing. It needs a lot of work. I think it could be salvaged with a director's cut that rearranges the order of things, improves character development, improves the sound track, and just overall is made more cohesive.Having said all that, the movie has a fairly interesting ending. I won't spoil it, but should you go see the movie and want to leave, don't. You'll miss the best part.",Anna

If you are the kind of person that allows some minor details to completely ruin a movie, especially an action movie which, from what I can tell, in the last 40 years, action packed movies are usually filled with non realistic scenes, stunts, and or minor period piece errors, but that is not the reason anyone is watching them!

Yeh okay the storyline is perhaps not as in depth as Leon or Nikita but that's needless to say that it doesn't have depth because it does.
The character development is brilliant as Anna the main character develops for us to form a relationship with (whether you like her or not)
The in-depth story about her past is exceptional and just enough without leading astray.
Twists and turns I was not expecting as you delve into the story.
Perhaps a gripe but that's with nearly all Hollywood movies is that why chose a British actress for a KGB operative? Though she seems to befit the character really well.
Cillian Murphy and Sasha Luss make the movie just that extra special with amazing talent and script.The choreography is just stunning and pure perfection and should receive an award just on this alone. Sasha Luss performs exquisitely as every tiny detail comes to life to make you believe she is a true assassin.Go see the movie.

I was very surprised at how good all the action scenes were considering I'm sure we were all thinking how is a model built like a noodle supposed to fight and kill all these bad guys? I applaud Sasha for all the training he underwent for this. Now to the storyline. I was pleasantly surprised and how engaged I was in this. Action movies tend to be quite bland in between all the actions scenes but this had so many twists you really start to question everything that's happening. But the twists in this movie were so well done you genuinely are at the edge of your seat wondering who's really who and what's really what. It's hard for me to give a 10 so a 9 is quite high for me especially cause action movies aren't generally my kind of genre. Would definitely pay to see it again!",Anna

No. It is a hacky remake with nothing original and is missing a lot of his signature elements and style. The missing pieces are the best pieces. Just one silly hack moment- her first assassination. Some big dude, not even sure why he was targeted. She kills at least 2-3 obvious body guards. Then! About 26 more body guards come out of woodwork and we have a never ending series of gory and brutal killings. Who travels with 30 body guards for lunch in a restaurant?!? Vladimir Putin? The choreographed action is just non-sensical and becomes video game silly. Then I knew I wasn't watching a real movie; just a recording of killings.The time jumps were not bad. That is the only interesting element to story. May be why Luc B. thought this would fly.(and, yes.

Reciting Russian prose does not add intellect to a movie. If you like trashy Shades of Grey this will be rightupyourstreet.. The editing is really poor. Scenes go from day to night out of sync. It's full of continuity errors. And the messy time jumps don't help. There's some proper hammy acting too but with a script that bad, it's hard to tell if the actors are just on an impossible mission. The overall story is weak .. relying on destructive relationships to get you emotionally involved. I didn't care about any of them. Yeah there were some crazy shoot outs, but again the fight sequences were poorly choreographed and at times ridiculously so. Mr Murphy is a solid actor and easy on my eye but he managed to come across as pretty ordinary in this role. No charisma.As for the attempts at Russian accents from out British actors ..oh dear. Terrible. Mirren went from heavy over the top Russian
to Welsh in one sentence. These kinds of mishaps totally spoil the movie. As soon as you are laughing at a terrible script ..the immersion is lost. To be fair ..

Not even Helen Mirren or Cillian Murphy could redeem this one. Luss has some presence but she's either a poor actor or the direction is lacking (probably a bit of both).Luc Besson is really just laughing at his audience now, as he knows there are enough suckers to fall for his ""style"", and the odd big name actor to give his films a veneer of credibility. Anna isn't even bad in a good way, the kind of Jean Claude Van Damme bad that you might actually be able to sit through if you were desperate for a distraction.I couldn't even finish it.

422,msebold55,The REAL Kick-ass Fem Spy Movie,10,13 April 2020,"I recall three female master spy/action movies that came out between 2017 and 2019: Atomic Blonde, Red Sparrow, and this movie. Anna is by FAR the best of the three. Plot, lead actress, supporting cast, you name it. This is the sleeper hit of female kick-ass spy movies. Start with Russian BOMBSHELL actress Sasha Luss. I didn't know much about Magadan Oblast (where Luss is from) but I really want to go there now. Just a stunning young woman, and a fantastic actress. She obvious is not a classical dramatist, or trained on the British stage. No. She is a Russian woman. And everything she says, and all her mannerisms are dramatically understated. Once you take this into account, her brilliant acting skills become apparent.As Anna, Luss demonstrated the most amazing combination of brains, determination, confidence and vulnerability. I found it sexy as hell. In Luss, Besson was really able to bring the character to life. The supporting cast is also excellent. From Helen Mirren, as her Russian handler, to Cilian Murphy and Luke Evans, spy-versus-spy CIA/Russian opponents, and Anna's love interests, the supporting cast brought out the best in Luss and allowed her to shine.The story is excellent. Anna, a poor abused young woman is offered a Hobson's choice by the KGB. She can escape her current situation only if she will agree become a KGB assassin for five years, a position from which she will likely not emerge alive. The story is told in a series of flashbacks, at the end of which it is discovered how Anna accomplished her remarkable feat.The movie did give a bit of superhero element to Anna, but it did not overplay it or make the movie seem cartoonish. There were two big action scenes. The first was magnificent. Early on Anna takes out 20 bad guys in a restaurant. Luss is wonderfully athletic and agile, the scene was brilliantly choreographed, and Luss's attitude was vicious and agressive to the point of being scary. She was a cold-blooded tigress taking out her prey one by one. This was not some phony Fists of Fury scene. Twenty men were going to die. She knew it the moment she walked in the door and they did too.Because Luss is Russian woman playing a Russian role there were no Academy Award nods. If the movie had been given its due consideration Helen Mirren should have been given a best supporting actress nomination. She was absolutely that good.Okay, perhaps this move did not deserve the full 10-star rating I gave it. Perhaps only an 8 or a 9. I just got tired of seeing so many unjustly low ratings. The movie was absolutely excellent.",Anna

424,Cinema_Kane,"Been there, done that . .",5,4 August 2021,"There's some solid acting here, but the story? Meh. This movie' derivative of ""Nikita"" and ""Point Of No Return"", far superior films also written by Luc Besson in the 90s with a story that felt original and complete, and not another in the ongoing series of imitative, John-Wicksploitation, segue-to-video-game vehicles. And this is definitely not a misogynist-driven criticism of a female in a previously male-dominated genre, because in my opinion the best spy-assassin action thriller of the last decade is ""Atomic Blonde"" with Charlize Theron. Rather, this is an indictment of lazy, unoriginal storytelling from someone who has clearly demonstrated a flair for intriguing action films in the past.

Red sparrow, columbiana and a couple of others, one with Angela Jolie who was a double agent.The great thing about this movie is the Lead actress whom played the assassin was amazing , she looked tough, fast, deadly and beautiful. The script was very cleverly done and the action scenes were perfection.
The way the story unfolds and goes back and forth in time scenes is brilliantly done that make sense as the film moves forward.The film only took 30 million worldwide, this is down to problems of misconduct which led to the marketing not being as good as it should.

So why just 9 stars and not 10? Well, I don't want to sound like I was paid to give a high-star rating.",Anna

444,RyaanKiing,Luc Besson does a Luc Besson,4,15 October 2019,"I can't decide whether giving Luc Besson a decent sized budget to create a film is a good idea or not? He creates a good film then will do like 2-3 super poor movies that flop at the box office. I do have a controversial opinion, I really enjoyed his last film, Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets. There were obvious areas of improvement but all in all, I had a good time and rate it quite highly. I just can't say seem to say the same for ANNA. It didn't surprise me like I was hoping for, it didn't give me that oh so that was awesome instead it just straight-up disappointed me. From this, I don't have much faith in the next film he directs if we follow a one good then a few bad rule.As always, ill start with the things I enjoyed. Yes, believe it or not, I did enjoy something in ANNA, not much but I'll take any enjoyment I can get out of these situations. The part I enjoyed was the fight scenes, the choreography to be more specific. Everything was very fluid and pleasing to watch. It reminded me a lot of the fight scenes from the John Wick films which I guess is what they were aiming for. Shots are taken, shots are fired back, it felt very close to real. There wasn't any invincibility mode shown where the protagonist just cannot be beaten or take any pain at all. So yeah really appreciate that Luc, you did something correctly.Here we go into the negatives, what I didn't like about ANNA. To start off with probably the biggest negative that killed the whole experience for me, this was the acting felt super wooden. Every performance just felt a little off. I'm not saying that the actors/actresses are bad, they are brilliant just not in this. It was almost like they signed up thinking ANNA was going to be something else then when they realized it wasn't and they couldn't get out of their contracts, they put in the bare minimum to pass through. I just couldn't get past the stiff performances, it was driving me nuts throughout. You would have been better off bringing in some upcoming actors/actresses. As they are trying to build their name they will stay with films like this rather than give up. I don't like to see talent wasted but I feel like all were in ANNA.I'm going to bring these next two points together because they are very similar. Firstly, c'mon Luc design a goddamn plot structure and stick with it. That's it. Just think before you start filming. I couldn't see a single part of a plot structure in ANNA, there isn't one at all. The plot is all over the place, especially for a run of the mill action flick which usually has a simple structure. I'm surprised they got it so wrong. You have end fight scenes at the beginning followed by everyday life scenes followed by then starting fight scenes. You are pretty much thrown all over the place. Similarly leading on from this, in ANNA something big will happen that will be a good plot point, however, straight after this you are presented with '2 weeks earlier' or '3 months earlier'. The next scene that follows, will now explain everything away from what you were shown before. THIS HAPPENS SO OFTEN. You begin to feel like everything that happens is just going to change after 2 minutes. I'm not saying this isn't a useful trick to use and can be placed quite well. But this is overused so bad it gets annoying very quickly. I'll be honest in saying that this is what I'll remember from ANNA, the constant unnecessary changes.I don't believe there will be a sequel, if they are thinking about it, they should stop that right now. From the trailer and film description, you would believe that ANNA would be similar to what the Black Widow film will be like. Far from it, very far from it. If Marvel did a film like this, the financial losses would be astronomical. There isn't an after-credits scene, only me running far away from this film.",Anna

Strong performance by Sasha Luss, the action scenes are very well acted.Story switches a lot, so much between years that you lose the track but at the same time it excites you.

455,xmutee,"Come on peeps, can't take a bit of tongue-in-cheek?",9,19 September 2019,"Yes, the tech mash-up was there, but it was obviously deliberate! You reckon Besson is not old enough to remember the 80'? He is! He knows there were no cell phones, no thin laptops, no 21st century Mercedes and H3C Chinese routrers or hard disks as we know them today (back then a hard disk unit was the size of a washing machine and the disk itself was a stack of platters weighing 10 pounds, with a handle on the top and the size of a birthday cake). USB? Forget about it (like Depp said...)! Not just in the USSR, anywhere!But hey, it's OK for Spiderman to do the he does (not possible in our universe), but not OK for Besson to tackle a bit of sarcasm? Or you forgot what that means?Actually, for what it is (a fantasy-action flick) it'a quite enjoyable and entertaining. Direction excellent, acting top notch (yes, the is not only a hot model turned actress, surprisingly she can act too) and the plot is super and airtight (if you care to follow it and not focus on the cell phones and such).If you want historic accuracy, then watch a documentary. This is not for you. But if you're looking for Besson entertainment give it a watch. Worth it! Bet you didn't bash ""Atomic Blonde"" for all the historic innaccurracies cuz it had Bowie soundtrack (yeah, it got to me too...). But from that standpoint, it was just as ""bad"". Or was it?!Get a grip, watch it for what it is and sod the naysayers. No, Besson should not retire, he should keep at it!I give it a solid niner, just because the tenner always belongs to ""Leon"". Yes, another Besson flick, his best ever and a desert island movie.",Anna

460,adrian-martin-am,Incredible Goofs,3,26 July 2019,"As others reviewers have mentioned, Dame Hellen Mirren is trying as Sisyphus to push up the movie up the steep slope of quality... but the burden of the multiple failures within is overwhelming... so we must contend ourselves with the scenes where she is in, a delight for us all...
I wanted to point out the lack of professionalism in the scenes' setting:
A. When Anna enters the bathroom of the hotel suite, where she is with her Russian target, we notice the bathrobes with 'Le Bristol' crests;
B. When the US agent (well played by C.M.) is questioning her - the name of the hotel is Meurice ...at least 2 times this name is mentioned;
C. When the blond double exits the very same hotel, in the surveillance pictures the name Shangri La Paris appears....
It appears that they shot this sub-par movie (euphemistically put) and hastidly kicked it out in the cinemas, without at least a review of the contents?
The only explanation for a hotel having three names simultaneously is over-lapping universes, so a SCI FI thriller... this would explain not only the technology leap of communication, storage, etc. devices - but the deadly fighting skilks of an anorexic model, who after 1-2 years training (!) was able to maim and off cohorts of skilled bodyguards... and the cherry on the top: how is that in French that 'Anna M' means luck, fortune, etc. as the fashion assistant baptises her in the begining... I cannot find any etymological support to this...
I suggest the name of the movie to be ""Anna and the King Besson the 1st - walk of shame Moscow to Paris""
Add on - I usually agree with freedom of choice, but I am sorry to say that those reviewers who noted this move with marks above 8 - are very loose with their exigence, to say the least.
Please read all the reviews noted 1 to 4 - there are pertinent observations, which cannot be discarted easily!
C'mmon, guys, if you really want to review movies, put some brain matter to work!

For me, this film is one of the best action/ spy/ assasin related movie to date. The story is interesting, and easy to swallow. And the acting was very good also, Sasha was very convicing as an assasin / model. The other actor (Mirren, Evans, and Murphy) also very good.

That adds a few surprises, twists and turns. It explains a few things and makes the movie very interesting. They think she is just a drug user. Really? She was in the military academy until her parents were killed. She was raised by a military father who taught her chess a an early age and she was very skilled. The movie start at a low point in her life when she has lost her parents, is with a worthless boyfriend who gets her in trouble. She gets an opportunity to work for the KGB. The model is her cover.

487,dontscrewupp,"A very solid, enjoyable film.",7,22 November 2019,"It's a great movie - very entertaining and highly unpredictable. It's not the most realistic but that's fine, movies of this sort tend to be like that but most people ignore it because the protagonist is a man.'Anna' is exceptionally smart and deadly - a little close to a fault. A lot of people say that she was underplayed by her beauty, which lead to a robotic and one note performance, and I respectfully disagree. First of all, the first people to blame are the directors and the writing, not the actress. She can't have a personality if she's not given or directed to have one. Second of all, throughout the movie we don't learn a lot about her personality, just her background and main motivation - and that's kind of the point isn't it? She's supposed to be a blank page. How emotive does a spy who kills and uses people for a living need to be?My main issue with this film is how it handles it's LGBTQ characters. We are not the joke. We are not walking stereotypes / caricatures.Ana uses 3 different love interests (2 men, 1 women) throughout the movie - yet only the straight white male ones are acknowledged throughout the end of this movie.The female one had a great character - she was caring, loving, affectionate and was really a character of her own. She helped carry the film with her bubbly and excitable personality - total contrast to Anna. Yet Anna never seem to care about her. So I would often ask myself throughout the movie - Why does she care about Anna? Never once in this film did I ever see Anna doing something nice for her. She's being nothing but distant and cold towards her. It's expected me to assume they're closer behind the scenes as she's living with her - but it's unbelievable to me.So just so we clear - this isn't about Anna uses her, as she uses everyone, it's about her being a lot less important and lacking a good closure. I mean, there's closure with her, but it's not really executed well.Those are my own gripes with an otherwise great film. Overall a step in the right direction as to what I want to see in today's cinema.

I hate when people don't do their research - not even a simple ""when was the Nokia cell phone created"", much less copying files by osmosis (Wi-Fi hasn't been invented yet, so I'm assuming it had to be osmosis). Oh, and the KGB and the CIA are not exactly understanding when it comes to a smart mouth or ""in so stressed - I need a vacation"".

498,edmoy,Wannabe Wick with a Russian Doll Blonde,5,13 October 2020,"Movie is watchable. Good Cinematography. Picturesque locations. And a recognizable talented supporting cast.Action choreography for the big restaurant fight scene was on par with some of Luc's other movies.The Biggest Problem is the story seems like a rehash of La Femme Nikita but with a Russian Blonde model assassin as protagonist.It feels like the director and producers were trying to create a mashup of Atomic Blonde, Red Sparrow and John Wick. But this movie is not as much fun as the John Wick movies - and the lead actress here lacks the charisma of a Charlize Theron or Jennifer Lawrence.As for the supporting cast, it must have been a paycheck gig for Mirren, Murphy and Evans. All of whom are barely in the movie as they probably only worked a few days each for the few scenes they're in.There's also a lesbian relationship tossed into the mix as another model, Maude falls in love with Anna who is bisexual (she's banging the Luke Evans and Cillian Murphy spy characters).However, none of Anna's relationships has any weight to them. It all feels forced, boring, shallow and not emotionally engaging. We barely get to know anything about Maude so her relationship with Anna seems like plot contrivances.I think the whole thing would've been a lot more fun if they had just amped the humor.I think the movie wanted to have a Red or Red 2 graphic novel comic dark humor sensibility but falls short.On top of that there are major technical errors. Laptops like the one she used didn't exist around 1985-1990. Also cellphone being used and the surveillance cameras were way too modern in terms of quality for that era.Overall this felt like the director was parodying his previous films and trying to recapture his 1990s prime years.It's surprising that financiers gave Besson multimillions to workout his director's midlife career crisis with this forgettable mess.Kind of reminiscent of how another big name 1990s Director John Woo tried to recapture his prime with the forgettable Manhunt.Meh sums it for me as I was watching this movie. The action fight and shootouts were bland. The sex scenes short and forgettable.There were some twists that seemed rather pedestrian as Anna double crosses the spy handlers.But since the characters were forgettable, I found I didn't really care about them. Nothing stood out to me about them.At least Red and Red 2 or even the Kingsman movies were funny and had memorable action sequences. This movie had none of that.",Anna

Some folks don't like the structure of the story presenting an event and then jumpoing back in time to explain what reallhy happened. This didn't bother me because of the great visual style and this movie knows it's a 3-D comic book and doesn't pretend it's anything else. The last third of the movie is what really makes the first part worth it. I does have something to say about women's independence. Nothing new or deep but it cements the relationship between the lead character and the always excellent Helen Mirren who is low-key, believable. but also manages to take proper bites out of the scenery.",Anna

515,DrewzQuickReviewz,Atomic Bland,4,21 June 2019,"The titular character, our protagonist, is a mystery to everyone in this film and unfortunately to the audience as well. We follow her through scattered time and location jumps that push her through to the end of the film but at no point does the film introduce any personality or meaningful character traits besides the fact that she is good looking. She even at a point becomes a very unlikeable character that's difficult to get behind for the remainder of the story. Her important relationships (if you can call them that) are never actually given proper development besides a line or short sex montage to suggest they've grown close offscreen. What little action there is (two sequences) is bland and boring. Also, the film wastes Helen Mirren and Cillian Murphy. In the end this one is overlong, unfocused and follows an utterly charmless (besides being a great beauty) protagonist through a barebones plot and it lacks the fun and style you want from a proper spy/action film. You can skip this one.",Anna

Zero charisma, zero emotion, zero personality. Without a lead character to work with, the supporting cast appears to almost be in a separate film, one which would probably be far more enjoyable.Mirren, Murphy and Evans would have been more entertaining if they had been simply left to chat together in a bar for a couple of hours.",Anna

557,adame-01862,"This movie is joke, da?",3,10 November 2019,"Who are the people giving this movie ratings of 8 or higher? For this joke?This plotline is getting really repetitive. Attractive down and out young woman is taken in by super-powerful spy agency and turned into a professional killer. Along the way she kills a bunch of people (usually big tough trained bodyguard types who would break her neck in two seconds flat in the real world), has some subversive love interest, has to deal with a butch older female senior spy who makes her life hell for a while, and triumphs despite impossible odds and ridiculous plot twists. (Please note, I didn't watch it to the end, so I have no idea if she really does triumph in the end, but that's the usual storyline so I'm assuming so).The best was the original, La Femme Nikita. Each movie of this genre after that was worse, and more unrealistic, than the one before.I fly long distances for work and will sometimes look for mindless movies to take up some time on the plane when I just don't want to think. I managed to sit through all of Red Sparrow some time ago, even though that movie pretty much sucked. With Anna, however, I couldn't make it through the whole thing, it was just that bad. Aside from the bizarre historical inaccuracies, the laughable plot went from being mindless entertainment to outright insulting the intelligence of anyone past puberty.The only good thing about this movie is that stopping it half way through gave me enough time to watch all of the Asphalt Jungle before the plane landed.Seriously, whoever is giving this POS anything above a 5, I hope you are getting paid to write your positive reviews.",Anna

562,cemil-turun,Nikita revisited after 29 years by its prodigy author/director,9,21 June 2019,"I have watched Anna on the first day of screening in a cool Istanbul cinema. I am a big fan of Luc Besson, knowing full well his great as well as some disastrous works. However, Nikita, Leon also Subway, Big Blue, Fifth Element are among my all time favorite films. Also ""Taken"" character is a creation of Besson! He is very original, a real European prodigy.Anna is a kind of 2019 remake of La Femme Nikita-(1990) with a new and original face (Sasha Luss) who does a decent job of fooling the viewer into different roads during the film. She has a female poker face and smile. I think Besson noticed her ability to deceive viewers earlier in her motion capture role during Valerian (2017) shooting and decided to remake Nikita with her. (Did he also fall in love with her as happened before with Anne Parillaud and Milla Jovovich? I am curious.)Some younger viewers may have a problem with the action scenes: A female lead doing fast action scenes is not so original they would say: Atomic Blonde and Kill Bill for example, had them. However, my younger viewer friends should know that these films owe big time to Nikita and Leon. Maybe for that reason, in Anna, Besson makes fun of both Atomic Blonde and Kill Bill! Her black leather fight costume is a salute to Atomic Blonde and tens of black suited body guards that she kills in a restaurant is a smile to Tarantino. The earliest female hitman, sorry, hitperson was Nikita! She was a very big shock to viewers in 1990 (I had watched it also on the first day). So was Leon. Americans almost couldn't watch that great film due to censorship.Anna the character is: 60% Nikita, 20% Leeloo of Fifth Element and 20% Leon's girl. Character Alex is = 100% Bob (of Nikita).I recommend everyone to go and see Luc Besson's latest ideas and without giving away spoilers it is impossible to write more about this film. I liked it and enjoyed it. 9/10.",Anna
563,goouimatt,Luc Besson - genius at work,7,29 June 2019,"This is not Fifth Element, but it is also not about body count, it has strong character development, a twist and turn plot, with acting that keeps you engaged. The actor's intensity draws you in and the action scenes put you in the edge of your seat. This could have gone deeper and been longer, but I think Luc has a limited budget and knew what he was working with. I recommend this over John Wick and the many kill em all movies out there. This movie has a heart and message. Not for kids, but definitely a date movie and one I will rent to watch again.",Anna

565,tangentsmith,There was a great director Luc Besson once.,1,14 March 2020,"Such a phenomenal piece of anti Russian propaganda from a person whose country is about to blow up of social issues. It is not about USSR or KGB. Red Sparrow, Chernobyl, Anna... They are all the same films with only one idea behind. It is about to paint all the Russians black without any time context. It is all about erasing the border between USSR and modern days Russia.
Director makes it look like it is still a Soviet pre 1991 era while there are laptops, mobile phones, modern cars and many other things that don't belong to that time and for some reason pagers are still used in US what is out of normal person understanding.
All that grayish colors and dirt, half ruined buildings and flats has nothing to do with real life in the Soviet Union in the 80s as the country was on its peak pretty much with all the possible social benefits such as free medicine, free education, free flats, guaranteed holiday trips from employers to the south regions of the country. Guaranteed employment after graduation. Everything was nice and clean and those gray and dirty streets filmed in eastern European countries for such films are part of modern European Union and not the Soviet Union of 80s. What is a biggest thing to think about what is going on in the western world!
Such a shame to see old good directors these days multiplying their names by zero taking part in political and just stupid moneymaking projects that make people hate them all over around the globe.",Anna
566,derekmen-86753,"Low on Action, but still fun!",7,12 July 2019,"Directed by the spotty Luc Besson, Anna follows a woman who becomes a Russian spy to escape her tormented past and start anew. Things get complicated when she realizes that getting out is harder than getting in, and she soon finds herself fighting for her life and her freedom. Anna is a movie that put Luc Besson back in my good graces after the heavily maligned, but successful, Lucy put me off of his projects for some time. Here he seems to be a bit more focused, and knows what story he wants to tell. Anna's experiences in this film help make her a very sympathetic character right from the beginning. We see her struggle, and we see why she chose the path she is on. Then we see her work hard to stay there, until staying there is no longer something that she needs. We go through the emotional rollercoaster associated with these changes along with her, which really helps create tension when she is in situations that are life threatening. We care for her. This coupled with a great performance from newbie Sasha Luss, and you have one of the better written female protagonists in recent memory. The movie is also very fun. It doesn't take itself too seriously, and definitely infuses humor into a scene whenever it can to lighten the mood in an otherwise dark story. I found myself laughing way more than I expected, and I liked that. Helen Mirren is a standout here, consistently funny and mysterious. I'm surprised she didn't have more screen time. The narrative structure of the film helps keeps the viewer invested, since you have to pay close attention to really understand what is actually happening. This helps the fairly simple plot feel consistently fresh, even though the audience may catch on to where certain threads may be heading. The action sequences are by far some of the best you'll see this year. They are expertly crafted and really fun to watch. It just a shame there are really only 2. This film was promoted as being this years Atomic Blonde or Red Sparrow, so a plethora of action scenes was expected. Instead we only got 2, one of which was shown almost entirely in the trailer. This doesn't hurt the film too much, but it was disappointing to realize they held back the action in favor of the story. Overall Anna is a fun popcorn flick with heart. I suggest giving it a watch! Just dont expect a female Bourne film. At least, not yet. I have high hopes for a sequel.",Anna

Having said that, I have to say, this movie was made brilliantly!I do feel that the jumps within the movie, the back and forth makes it a bit fuzzy. And some equipment used in the movie, I really don't think it existed during the time portrayed.But the twists.. The unexpected twists really make it a worthwhile movie to watch.

-Great cast
-beautiful direction

Of course, it's clear that it isn't the best movie I've ever seen : the story seems sometimes a little boring and the acting isn't mindblowing.However, the story is really refreshing : the American action movies I've seen recently have been really too predictable, with a lot of treason. The plot of Anna has really the potential to surprise you, even when you thought you had understood what was going on. This is not the first movie to have that kind of storyline, but it manages the expectations well.As for the acting, I think that Sasha Luss did a good job and I don't understand some critics saying that she "" shows zero promise as a movie star."" (The Hollywood Reporter).So yeah, it's an average movie but it holds well together and it is quite enjoyable and different from the usual american blockbuster, with an interesting end.",Anna

They just have to be interesting !The actor who plays ANNA - ""Sasha Luss"" did a fantastic job and was able to do the core action scenes herself. The acting was not the best but the story is all that matters. The cinematography and the colors were really cool and fited the way the story was told.The only reason I didn't rate it a 10 is because I rewatched it and didn't quite liked it as I liked it the first time.But surely this movie deserves more than a 7.",Anna

Seems like they just wanted to use the KGB so they set it for that time period, but they should have just used a more modern Russian intelligence agency and kept it in modern times. Also all the time jumps, 6 months ago, 3 months ago, 6 months ago, 3 years ago just gets annoying, everything is trying bro be explained too much, how many times to we need to be explained she is good at chess?

This should have been marketed to those audience characteristics that enjoyed the earlier films/HBO series. It was enjoyable, with the only criticism being how it jumped around in its timeline. The whole ""3 months earlier"", ""2 years later"" would have worked better in the timeline was more linear, but maybe they wanted to use that to distinguish it from ""Point of No Return"". Adding a little ""Red Sparrow"" subplot, where the prior Gabriel Byrne character becomes two characters in Anna; one KGB and one CIA, the central motivation is for Anna to be free and not continue living in a ""box"" whether it be the bos her boyfriend made for them , or the box the KGB made for her.

606,alistarb,"Not bad, Not Great",6,17 August 2020,"To me the movie shined when showing Anna's life before she became what she became. I found the realism and intensity and drama of that part of her life could have been applied to the rest of the film to make it a better movie but it wasn't. The way the movie depicts the struggle in her life should have been applied to her career later on. But as the movie progresses her battle scenes begin to look alot like a fake martial artists going through the motion. You know how it is all going to turn out. It is highly orchestrated. Everything gets too easy for her as the story progresses I think. And it gets boring and predictable because of that.
I think a good contrast for excellent action and fighrting with a female lead is the end of Atomic Blonde. If you haven't seen that you should because the fighting seems more realistic, more difficult, there is more of a struggle which makes the her victories in the end, more satisfying.
Still Anna is probably worth watching for entertainment but it just wasn't as good as it could have been.",Anna

Belief had to be suspended for the John Wick like fight scenes where a 116 lbs 5'10"" model takes out dozens of trained soldiers, mafia hitmen or body guards but the scenes were well choreographed and fun to watch.

Not only is there action and suspense, but there are many unexpected moments of comedy. Is way more fun than some of the reviews on here would have you to believe.
That it is not realistic... what can I say, neither is John Wick/Mission Impossible/Bourne/007 movies and nobody is complaining.

Unfortunately, some of us where actually there and remember it as it was.The lack of even a whiff of period correctness ruins everything.Ohhh, and the plot is just a re-hash of La Femme Nikita.

648,antoineruello,A good synthesis of Besson's cinema,7,23 August 2019,"Besson shows us a good movie which off course has defaults but which definitively don't deserves all the hate that it receive
During all the movies, the lovers of Besson's work will be delighted because we can see hundreds of references about the Fifth element, Leon, Lucy or La Femme Nikita. Except one or two scenes which are a bit ridiculous, this movie has his own atmosphere and own brilliant actors. Indeed, the work of Eric Serra is as always essential and give an atmosphere which immerse us in the cold war environment. Moreover, you'll see Helen Miren as you had never seen her before. The actions scenes are really good and it's a job well done (you can compare them to John Wick scenes).
The only drawback in the movie is the character of Cillian Murphy who would have deserved more importance and development.
This movie isn't the best of Besson, it do have some defaults but it is not boring or bad.",Anna

All the twists are predictable and needlessly complicated, also wrong on so many levels (for example at the end when Anna pretended dead she roll out from the screen, but the cameras recording her through this, so if there are not blind agents in KGB and CIA everybody knows already she is not dead. :) The action in this movie is like a John Wick light, very light.

I didn't expect such dramatic facial expressions and clean actions from a new face but she did it all. I think this is the way to shoot storylines of our opponents' countries. At the same time we want to ""win and be proud"" in movies, we want to explore their talents and learn something while entertaining. Sasha went to Cambridge and is on the cover of Vogue hence her talent is recognized by the west. With competition from China, spy stories about China should be shot and should recruit some Chinese talent educated abroad.",Anna

The movie is far too slow at times, far too cheesy with the love triangle (totally unnecessary), far too much dialogue, and far too much sex - totally unnecessary.The lead character is stunning and she carries out the action scenes very well. Very promising. She's one for the future.I can also see how feminists would love this - it seems directors these days are being forced to include some sort of LGBT or feminist pleasing elements for ""today's"" audience.It had great potential but definitely not Luc Besson's best piece of work.",Anna

This movie is to 007 what Chernobyl is to a functioning, modern, American nuclear reactor. I honestly don't know what was worse - the writing, the constant timeline changes, or the terrible twists. One thing is for certain - Luc Besson needs to leave his gloves in the ring and retire to a life of mediocre local theater plays. Anna is one step closer than Lucy to The Room level.

During the end of the movie, big applause from all audiences from the theater. Rare things that happens if the movie wasn't so good. The movie itself just so fresh with lots of back and forth storyline that needs our focus during the whole movie. Luss proved herself that indeed she's a big potential in the movie industry as she act so naturally and just gave this movie a breath of fresh air with her striking beauty. Helen Mirren is a also a stand out in this movie with her experienced acting throughout the years. She proved she's a pro in this field. The storyline shocks you from time to time with jaw-dropping plot twist from start to end with amazing well-choreographed actions.

This includes one that can be seen through the rear window in a scene set in a PARKED car.Look past the unforced errors, and you are left with a thoroughly enjoyable movie, with just enough plot twists to keep things interesting.

Worth watching only because of the actors. The music score does not match the action. It feels more like the score of a nature documentary. Also, INXS' I need you tonight does NOT fit there at all.Plus, it's full of temporal goofs and asynchronisms that make it lose the little credibility it could have.",Anna

Not because I think it's the ''best'' movie ever or something, but because... It's a movie. This is a movie, and a good one. There are no over the top shooting methods, tactics, the acting isn't absolutely perfect nor the choice of actors or even the theme of the movie. Nothing's perfect, it's good. It's very good. It's all a movie should be. There are no special effect distractions from the story and you know why I call this piece the definition of a movie? Because it's full of twists, turns, and surprises. Even the cliche moves ""he's alive after all isn't he?' are made to make you think, and they're done smart. It's a thriller and a spy/crime type of movie with everything you'd expect, in a very special way. I'd like to use the word ""direct"" for the script, the dialogue is very direct and straight forward. ""Do you work for the CIA?"" - ""Yes I do."" instead of ""A rabbit never jumps out of its hole until it's time."" type of crap. This follows throughout the movie, and is very welcome and perhaps even needed, with the a lot of the story being shown in retrospective scenes.TL;DR: No crap, no beating around the bush, straight-forward spy movie with good indirect camera work, direct dialogue, and twists and turns you wouldn't expect. For a spy movie, 8/10 at least.",Anna

First of all, the movie has a subject very interesting with the main actress very beautiful. Music is very well pointed at the correct place and good too. Yes it is true as others are saying, that time of the story is always shifted forward and backwords but this is not to make you tired or not understand, but for playing with your mind and to make you change all the time the final action. If you are enough clever it's not possible to not love this movie. The end of the movie gives you a big surprise, a mixture between power, love and smart.

Even the notebook computer looked like it was a model from 2019 lol...The movie itself is just a rehash of what we've already seen, only with much worse acting and a lousy script.

Also, as noted, the scenes supposedly happening in 1985 or 1990 are so ridiculously wrong (cell phones, laptops) you have to wonder why bother placing it in the distant past. (ah, the Russian villain...)It would have been better to build a different plot around the actress and action.",Anna

Especially the scene in which her junkie boyfriend insults her while seeing her apply for a job in the navy. Apparently she didn't know how to perform the upset feelings, and that makes this scene a total disaster.The same goes other scenes. The story itself is old, cheesy and predictable, but if you only watch this type once a year, probably won't feel that bad.

707,michie_field,kick ass fun,7,25 November 2019,"Being in the wrong place at the wrong time comes back to haunt Anna as she is recruited by some pretty nasty guys who play for keeps. Anna has to walk a razors edge while juggling all the nasty, one wrong move and they all close in for the kill.",Anna

709,rauan-kyrykbayev,The fail of Luc Besson,5,20 September 2019,"It was quite a pain to watch the movie. Poor realism, cliche plot, poorly developed characters and weak thrilling and too twisted end. The most disappointment comes from realizing that it has been shot by not a medium director, but the creator of the Fifth Element.",Anna
710,ranjf2000,No time and technology consistency,1,10 September 2019,"Will not get into too much details, technologies in the movie were not either available or even invented in the time-frame of the movie.",Anna
711,lukek-17-603043,The lead is super hot. Unfortunately that's all this movie has.,2,11 September 2019,Written by a young boy. Story is terrible. Shallow.,Anna
712,asrarkhan-129-242195,Don't bother. Waste of time.,3,20 November 2019,"Horrible acting. Very poor editing with frequent flash backs to explain the twists. The script is quite unengaging with dead pan delivery from the lead. Murphy, Evans and Mirren try their best to save this train wreck though.",Anna
713,nbyloo,I don't think I watched the same move as these negative reviews.,10,12 September 2019,"I read some of these negative reviews and most of the complaints are about technology in the 80s. But if you payed attention, the timeline moves to the 90s as indicated in the subtitle when that happens. So much of the protagonists character and personality are on display from each timeline iteration that it mystifies me how some of the reviews complain about character development. Lastly complaints about the action being luck luster. Did your version not have the restaurant fight sequence as one example? Truly bizarre. This movie was excellent. I loved everything about it without going into any detail, it is best to experience it not having any preconceptions or presuppositions of what you think it is or is supposed to be.",Anna
714,boriomi17,Surprisingly Worth it,8,23 June 2019,I went to watch this soooo last minute I decided to go on a date and it did not disappoint the plot twist were good the action scenes were dope and the ending was unexpected. Love spy movies like this!,Anna
715,katarina-rc,Only good thing about this movie is Cillian Murphy,2,30 December 2019,"This movie is so bad that a had to write my frist review xD
The beauty od Anna is beyond question but come on, skinny girl of 40kg (with bed) killing the whole kgb team? It's okay that one girl is capable to outfight bunch of people (she is killing machine trained for that), but this girl doesnt look that strong. Where are the muscles?! xD Her acting is so lame and boring! She is just pretty girl and that's it. And the whole story is deja vu but a much worse version! I can't belive that this is a Luc Besson! So disappointing!
If you wanna watch good spygirl movie, go watch Red Sparrow with amazing Jennifer Lawrence or even Atomic Blonde is better than this crap",Anna
716,simonkern-272-591848,Brilliant! A new Star is born,10,8 March 2020,"Coupled with a great script, nothing to deep here to slow the fast paced action. At times there is almost a Comedic sense to this movie, Sasha Luss heads the all star cast in another Luc Besson hit movie.This guarantees that you don't take it too seriously and just sit back and enjoy the action. Sasha Luss is a gem and I hope to see more of her soon.I have never rated a movie a ten however this one deserves it.Give it a go, you won't be disappointed!!",Anna
717,ullas-ahuja,Its a 10 in my book.,10,16 June 2020,Better than red sparrow. Way better than Atomic blonde.,Anna
718,gerobinalexa,One of the best espionage movie,10,12 September 2019,"It is a well told story, interesting and action filled. Sasha Luss portrayed the character marvellously and was perfect for Anna. The movie would have been so much improved if it's running time last for 2hours and 30 mins (for other character's development). But either way it turned out a masterpiece.",Anna
719,thomasz69,Anna,9,24 June 2019,"It's a shame that Anna is not being backed and promoted as it deserves, it a good and entertaining movie, well worth going to watch, and Sasha Luss deserves a lot of credit she was amazing.",Anna
720,votemikesummers,Hard to follow.,1,2 August 2021,"The story goes back and forth in time constantly, and pits a pretty girl against the KGB and the CIA in unrealist situation.Rated 1 because I can't give it a zero.10/10 on the ho-hum scale.Avoid at all costs unless you are just dumb as sticks like the morons that rated it 8. Give me a break.",Anna
721,damir-atd,ABSOLUTE CRAP,1,2 November 2019,"The movie is disastrous, poor acting with even poorer scenario, I cannot believe that someone is making this. Story to whom even children of 5-6 years would laugh. Not to mention cell phones, laptop computers and hard disks and cameras which did not exist at that time. Absolute waste of time. Luc Besson is totally out of league.",Anna
722,cassidydmitchell,"I usually like most movies, I'm easily impressed. But this blew.",3,28 June 2019,"I usually like most movies. Especially like these. But I thought Anna was so boring and confusing. The action was great, but there was no action. It was like 5 minutes of the whole movie. I dunno. I usually don't write reviews, but I couldn't stand this movie.",Anna
723,bashekumar,Cellphone on 1990's,3,3 November 2019,"I do like the movie but if the timeline is in early 2000 it will all make sense. How come in 1988-1991 everybody is using cellphone. They even got Nokia 3310 I think in the movie. Then the flash drive, hard drive on cctv, etc. These are just a few tech on display that not even invented yet. What a joke.",Anna
724,michael_tedjokusumo,The best movie 2019 so far,10,8 July 2019,"Perfect movie, salute for all the crew and movie maker! 5 thumbs up",Anna
725,modreanu-sorin,"Close your eyes to a ""few"" details and you will enjoy a fine spy-movie",9,19 September 2019,"First, it's a bonus if you didn't watch Luc's Nikita before watching this one.
Second, if you can skip the inaccuracies related to all of those things that shouldn't be there in the 80-90s, it will be even better.
Three, the lead is a bit annoying with the message it obviously sends, but it ain't hard to ignore.I enjoyed the twists, the majority of which weren't as predictable as some might insinuate, and those much hated flashbacks didn't bother me at all. If you watch it with no expectations you will be very pleased with the result.So, if you match the criteria go enjoy a nice (and i might even add, smart) movie. If not, leave the rest of us enjoy it!",Anna
726,mikexr22,Stop reading metacritics,9,11 September 2019,"One of the movies I had the most fun with in the last 5 years, I liked it better than JWick 3, and yes it is fiction not a documentary about the soviet union in the 90's so all the historical mistakes with the laptops and mobile phones in the plot are irelevant. Thank you Luc Beson for making movies that are fun to watch.",Anna
727,sgtcrunk05,Solid movie,10,26 June 2019,"Fun cool stylish Russian espionage movie. First movie I've seen this actress in and she did great!! Definitely recommend if you like movies like red sparrow, nikkita, haywire",Anna

729,marshallwinterbach,A real Movie,10,27 June 2019,Its been a long time since I've seen such an dramatic entertaining movie.,Anna
730,dmjsearle,So much better than expected.,8,7 November 2021,"I can't quite understand why this film hasn't got a higher rating. It's never going to be a classic, though it is so much better than I was expecting. You could say that realism isn't its strong point, but the characters and story are better and more believable than Nikita or Red Sparrow (and I really like Jennifer Lawrence films). Sasha Luss is impressive and beautiful in the role of Anna.Perhaps some have marked it down because of errors about the technology and lack of appropriate realism as the film is set in the 1980s. Ignore this and you're in for a wild ride. What more do you want from a film like this?",Anna
731,xlii42,OMG...,2,16 May 2021,"I made an account just to complain about this movie.If you're older than 30yo don't watch it, it's just going to frustrate you.Reason being is that none of it makes any sense whatsoever. It's basically parallel reality fantasy where people use mobile phones in Soviet Union in 1985 (we didn't even have colour television back then), there are ATMs in Moscow in 1985. Soviet junkies have laptops and wi-if in 1985.Laptops weren't even invented and think about when you got your wifi installed in your house. USB ports in 1990. Nokia 3210 phones in 1990. Windows 95 in 1990. Soviet citizens can be scouted for modelling work behind iron curtain. American citizens walking around freely in Soviet Moscow without a 10 deep KGB tail. Street lights and neon in Soviet Russia. Russian number plates on Soviet cars. Skinny model girl beating up dozens of KGB agents... ok it's a movie, but still. Hyundai's driving around in 1990 russia. People looking at the camera cos it was filmed like a You Tube video. Lots of unnecessary scenes. Modern everything all the time... in 1990.The timeline doesn't make any sense either. It's all random and scrambled.I could've sworn it was directed by a 15 year old. But turns out it was Luc Besson.Luc Besson, you're dead to me man. You were alive in the 80s you know it doesn't make any sense. How can you not care this much? I just can't forgive you for this.",Anna
732,trungthanhho,Above my expectation. Great enough to my first post here,9,19 September 2019,"I have a deal with a local movie theater. So I selected a movie that within my time schedule. So I went in without lots of expectation for Anna, maybe just another action movie. I was wrong. And the way the director made this movie really adds up the thriller and intense of it. I love it",Anna
733,davidnathanielkatzenbach,Nice Luc Besson job.,10,15 September 2019,"Despite the large number of negative judgments, I finish seeing Anna, and I loved it. While Luc Besson and Lucy's hand is evident, you can't help but notice their masterful work with Sasha Luss, with practically no cinematographic experience.Well thought out, entertaining.David Nathaniel KatzenbachThank you for the suggestion.",Anna
734,farisrazzouk,Good story line and suspenseful lots of action,8,4 October 2021,"Good decent action movie, with great acting and scenery.",Anna
735,raiko-42811,Yet another hot russian girl working as a spy against her will,5,26 December 2019,"I have always found it mildly annoying when a movie goes to 'X months earlier' and says 'Hey, here is the same scene you already watched but oh boy, here's something else that happened that completely changes things'. This one does this a lot.
Also, I'm not sure how many laptops and cell phones were around in the 1990 Soviet Union, but I'm fairly certain that couples living in poverty who spent most of their money on weed didn't have one.
The acting was good, I especially enjoyed Cillian Murphy and Helen Mirren. The action scenes were great as well, although there were like 3 of them.",Anna

737,colinloney,Nikita meets John Wick meets Kill Bill,8,1 April 2020,An action packed ride of a movie with enough twists and turns to keep you on your toes. Some outrageous fight scenes and some poorly researched tech history didnt stop me from being drawn into this movie from the beginning. It won't win any awards but it was definitely one of the better movies I've watched for a while.,Anna

739,yargamelifaro,A Parody which is not really funny.,2,23 September 2019,"Its clear that having anachronisms every 2 minutes of the film only shows that such mistakes were left on purpose, but this isn't a kind of movie where absurd feels really in the right place. 2 stars not 1 only because the general shooting and action are quite ok. Tried to watch this movie only because of respect to Luke Besson and his earlier masterpieces. Couldn't do it to the end this time.",Anna

743,aarnshn,Just Horrible; A True Cliche,3,16 September 2019,"This movie spits in the face of The Americans. It's full of twists just for the sake of twists. It is only pretending to be smart. If KGB actually operated like this, it would not have existed long enough to be the subject of modern spy movies.
One of the worst spy movies out there.
Also, the music simply does not fit the scenes witnessed in this movie, another failure.",Anna

The movie jumps around to different points in time to try and piece together each 'act', so it demands full attention (try not to get distracted texting or you may miss some important plot points). But it all comes together in a very satisfying end. Highly recommended",Anna
750,stineibanez,FUN AND THRILLING!,10,8 May 2020,"Love the strong female leads! I feel represented. It had s much twist and turns it was fun! Good thing I listened to my gut and watched the movie. This is why I never believe pretentious reviews by pretentious people. I don't believe the negative reviews. I believe in my own taste and preference, so I watched it and judged it for myself. I never listen to reviews at all. And you know what? It was fun. It wasn't disappointing at all. In the end, the main character got what she wanted or deserved, but it wouldn't have hurt if she leaned towards Cillian too lol. Cillian was gorgeous here. I'm starting to think this move was better than Red Sparrow.",Anna
751,oliviaavahale,Boring,1,10 September 2019,"I was excited to see this movie when I saw the trailer because it's led by a strong female character but I couldn't finish it. It seems like every scene is the same. The lead actors acting is very bland. The timeline is messy and the fact that she is clearly into men but in a ""lesbian"" relationship for the reason being ""a girl on her arm would keep the predators at bay"" this horrible line is said by the only other female character with a huge importance in the movie. Don't waste your time watching this movie. I would have given a 0/10 but the lowest is 1. Watch something else.",Anna

Obviously it doesn't match Leon, but such movie will never the matched!The plot is quite interesting, with some flashbacks and a lot of conspiracies, but the storyline keeps it all clear and together. Eventually I may consider that they have overdone the twists, but each one of them was quite interesting specially the... to avoid any spoilers, I'll just refer to it as the second twist.Obviously the storyline is not much realistic, but that was never the aim of the movie.For me, the top of all was Helen Mirren's performance!!!",Anna

It's unfortunate that it wasn't promoted due to allegations against Luc Basson. Hopefully the truth comes out and those involved in making/acting in Anna aren't hurt in the process. I hope this movie is a sleeper hit and more people get the chance to enjoy it.,Anna
