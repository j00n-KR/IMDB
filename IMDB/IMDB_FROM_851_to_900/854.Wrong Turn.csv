0,TheLittleSongbird,A worthwhile turn,6,8 December 2017,"Judging from my other reviews, you would not think that horror films would be my thing, especially very gory ones. Actually aim to have a diverse taste in film, so seeing films from all decades and genres with no bias intended. Plus have seen my fair share of horror franchises where at least one film has been good.Found myself surprisingly enjoying 'Wrong Turn' when slowly working my way through the films. Despite the mixed to negative critical reception, to me flaws and all it is the best of the 'Wrong Turn' films by quite some way, was less impressed with the sequels. It doesn't get everything completely right, but it is a long way from a wrong turn and is instead a worthwhile one.'Wrong Turn' is in terms of story simplistic and derivative admittedly. It also has thinly sketched characters, cheesy dialogue and a run-out-of-ideas ending. A longer length would definitely have helped, there were times where the film's duration felt too brief. So those are reasons enough to dislike the film and consider it bad.However, quite a lot is done right in 'Wrong Turn' as well. It has a slick and atmospheric visual look and has a wonderfully mysterious and creepy setting. The make-up is also well done. One of 'Wrong Turn's' biggest stars is the special effects, which send a chill down the spine in how realistically horrifying they are.The music score is suitably eerie and Rob Schmidt adeptly pays tribute to 1970s exploitation cinema. While the story may not be perfect in how it's executed, it really does deliver on the creepy mood, the gruesome shocks and also the fun. There is a lot of gore here but mostly it is not used in a cheap way, there are times where it is not needed but generally the mood isn't compromised.Despite the lack of development for the characters, the acting is not bad at all. Desmond Harrington, Eliza Dushku and Emmanuelle Chriqui in fact give pretty ballsy performances.In conclusion, worthwhile. 6/10 Bethany Cox",Wrong Turn
1,Leofwine_draca,"Straightforward gory horror, spoilt by incessant CGI",5,5 December 2016,"A typical slasher movie that takes John Boorman's DELIVERANCE as its central concept, then delivers tons of action, bloodshed, and virtually no plot for the rest of the ninety-minute running time. It has to be said that WRONG TURN starts off well enough. Two climbers are brutally murdered in the wilderness, then there's a suspenseful car-ride/crash which almost had me bolting from my seat. The film builds in tension as unseen evil stalks our cast, but after the first major gore scene, things go downhill fast. The rest of the film is a chase between our heroes and the cannibal men which lasts right up until the last (gruesome) minute. It's not bad, but something we've seen a hundred times before, so those looking for originality should go looking somewhere else. They won't find any here.One very annoying thing about this film is the reliance on poor CGI effects in scenes you wouldn't expect to see them. In one shot the entire forest is done with CGI, it looks ridiculous, why the heck would they want to do that? In other shots, the cast are supposedly balancing on branches high above the ground, but the CGI influence is obvious again. Finally they climb a watchtower, but is it really a watchtower? Nope, just a CGI animation. I wish film-makers would get out of this annoying habit. When I saw Stan Winston's name in the credits, I thought I would be in for some GREAT make-up like he's done in the past. I was wrong. The mutants in this film have nondescript makeup, which looks very much like makeup. Director Rob Schmidt realises this and keeps their faces hidden as much as he can, but he's wasting his time. It doesn't pay-off, and it looks like Winston's losing his touch. About time he won back some credit – when's your next JURASSIC PARK gonna be, Stan? The cast is so-so. I liked Desmond Harrington's leading man, stern and authoritative throughout, never backing down, never losing his resolve. He's my kind of hero. Eliza Dushku is very pretty as the heroine, and kicks backside too, so you can't lose there. Jeremy Sisto is on hand to supply comic relief and he's great, it's a shame he dies halfway through the film but you can't have everything. The film has routine action but goes over-the-top in the gore effects which reach new heights of sickness. We get to watch heads being axed off (deeply unpleasant) and other implements impale the human body. I used to enjoy gore when I was younger, it seems a little bit too much here, and in bad taste as well. Still, it could be worse I guess. WRONG TURN's best aspect is the isolated forest setting, but even that seems too slick and glossy these days. I preferred the low-budget horrors that came out of the USA years ago, which really WERE filmed out in the wilderness (take RITUALS). That's where the real fear lies.",Wrong Turn
2,SnoopyStyle,Pretty good horror,7,20 February 2014,"It's the Greenbrier Backcountry, West Virginia. Somebody is spiking the roads and killing people. Chris Flynn (Desmond Harrington) is in a rush but runs into a traffic jam. He tries the back roads, and crashes into a vehicle in the middle of the road. The other car had run over spikes left in the road. The other group is Jessie Burlingame (Eliza Dushku), Carly (Emmanuelle Chriqui), Scott (Jeremy Sisto), Evan (Kevin Zegers), and Francine (Lindy Booth). Some of them try to find help, but all of them are hunted by backwoods mountain men.It's 'Deliverance' with mutant men. In fact, one of the characters mentions it. It's pretty standard horror. The actors are good actors. The kills aren't that grotesque, but they're good. Emmanuelle Chriqui and Eliza Dushku are very hot babes. It's nothing original, but it's good for the horror fan in you. I do wish these guys pick up something to fight with.",Wrong Turn
3,claudio_carvalho,"Although Full of Clichés, a Good Horror Movie",7,12 November 2004,"Chris Flynn (Desmond Harrington) is driving his car for a job interview in another city. However, an accident with a trunk transporting chemical products blocks the highway and Chris looks for an alternative route through the mountains of West Virginia to accomplish his schedule. Due to a lack of attention, he crashes another car parked in the middle of the road with flat tires. Chris meets a group of five friends, who intended to camp in the forest, and they decide to leave the couple Francine (Lindy Booth) and Evan (Kevin Zegers) on the place, while Chris, Jessie (Eliza 'Faith' Dushku), Carly (Emmanuelle Chrisqui) and her fiancé Scott (Jeremy 'Billy Six Feet Under' Sisto) tries to find some help. They find a weird cabin in the middle of nowhere, where three violent cannibalistic mountain men with the appearance of monsters live. The two couples try to escape from the mountain men while chased by them. 'Wrong Turn' is a kind of mixture of 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre', 'Deliverance' and 'Jeepers Creepers' plus a collection of clichés of the genre. However, the blending is surprisingly good and hooks the attention of the viewer until the last scene. The great young cast, leaded by the gorgeous Eliza Dushku, is very attractive and performs a great job. I liked this movie a lot. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): 'Pânico na Floresta' ('Panic in the Forest')",Wrong Turn
4,kosmasp,"Extra ""Star"" Power",6,24 November 2009,"The ""Backwoods"" horror movies do get a lot of attention in the naughties. Quite a few have been shot (mostly with hot teenagers in the main roles, though ""Wrong Turn 3"" didn't go that way, but more on that on the WT3 site) and this is the first one of a trilogy ... well I'm pretty sure it wasn't even planned to do one sequel to this, but the success of the first one spawned two other movies (at the time of writing, because I'm pretty sure there will be more ""Wrong Turns"" to take ...) The WT movies as such don't have that much in common actually, even the villains being exchangeable (sort of, like another day another ""killer"" kind of). The movie as such wouldn't have gotten more than 5 stars from me, but because of the fact, that you have Jeremy Sisto and (especially) Eliza Dushku in this one, it get at least one extra star added to the vote! It's nothing special actually, it's pretty violent and gory of course ... which means, it will either excite you or leave you with a bad feeling in your stomach ...",Wrong Turn
5,gavin6942,Not the Modern Classic Many Assume It Is,6,22 February 2009,"A young professional (a doctor, perhaps?) and a group of fun-loving youngsters (including Eliza Dushku and horror regular Jeremy ""Jesus"" Sisto) are stranded on a back road -- the wrong turn -- somewhere in the South. Well, wouldn't you know, this turns into a nightmare where they come across cannibalistic, inbred mountain men.I really don't want to talk bad about this movie. I mean, I love Rob Schmidt's ""Right to Die"" and the action here was good, and the watch tower scene was awesome, and Jeremy Sisto makes me happy. But it's really not as amazing as it is made out to be. First of all, the idea of cannibal hillbillies just doesn't do it for me. It's not much of a variation from ""The Hills Have Eyes"", and Joe Lynch's ""Wrong Turn 2"" is significantly better than the first... of the inbred cannibal movies, this isn't the best. Though, I suppose it beats out ""Bloodlines"".I found the main male character's resilience a bit hard to swallow. Breaks his ankle, still runs, is able to jump twenty feet from a tower into a tree and grab on without slipping or smashing his ribs. I'll let Arnold or Sylvester get away with this... but the average man? I don't think so. The other characters failed to impress. Dushku is presented as the primary heroine, which she is, but really didn't capture me in a way that made me give a hoot. The cannibals could eat them all and I'd be perfectly hunky-dory with it.I have no reason to strongly recommend this film. If you catch it on TV or want to rent it, I say go for it. Owning it? Not so much. I own it, but I don't expect it to get many repeated viewings. And my owning something really says nothing if you consider I now have nearly 400 horror films in my collection, most of which are awful. Check out ""Hills Have Eyes"" (original and remake), check out ""Wrong Turn 2"" (you don't need to see the first for it to make sense)... if your thirst for cannibal rednecks isn't quenched, come back for ""Wrong Turn"". Not Rob Schmidt's best work, though possibly better than ""Alphabet Killer"".",Wrong Turn
6,jboothmillard,Wrong Turn,5,28 November 2005,"I have hardly seen any mutant films, unless you count X-Men, but what I mean is creatures that do not look very nice and are deformed. Basically Chris Flynn (Desmond Harrington) is lost somewhere on the road and on the way takes, ""the wrong turn"" and eventually crashes into a car. They are all lost and looking for help nearby. They include Jessie Burlingame (True Lies' beautiful Eliza Dushku), Carly (Emmanuelle Chriqui), Scott (Jeremy Sisto), Evan (Kevin Zegers) and Francine (Lindy Booth). Basically while looking for help they all get caught in a chase between them and three mutant, maybe human creatures. There is quite a bit of gore, and it is predictable in places, but is worth watching!",Wrong Turn
7,ma-cortes,"Good horror film with suspense, chills and tension",6,25 February 2005,"The plot line deals with a group of couples (Desmond Harrington-Eliza Dushku) ,(Jeremy Sisto-Emmanuelle Chiriqui) and the same couple of ¨Dawn of the dead¨ (Lindy Booth-Kevin Zegers) are going to hick at Virginia mountains. They will find a nutty and murderer family formed by cannibalistic mountain men and utterly disfigured, who will try to track down them into the woods. The protagonists will have to confront the ominous family starving of blood. 
It's a nice horror film , it's realized in fast-moving and isn't tiring, neither boring, but entertaining. From start to finish the grisly suspense and horror action is nonstop. The storyline has got a certain likeness to ¨Texas chainsaw massacre"" , ""Ed Gein"" and ¨House of 1000 corpses"". The movie takes parts of both films. The motion picture mixes terror , creepy and spooky atmosphere , screams and great loads of blood and gore. There isn't a real interpretation because of the actors run, kill and shout, only . However, the cinematography is astounding (here appears wonderful forests landscapes) to difference ¨Texas chainsaw massacre¨ by Tobe Hooper , whose photography was granulated and worn-out .Picture achieved success in boxoffice, in spite of the violence and grisly killings . The movie isn't apt for boys, neither squeamish. The flick will appeal to terror and gore fans. Rating : nice terror film . Well worth watching.",Wrong Turn
8,BA_Harrison,An effective addition to the 'backwoods horror' sub-genre.,8,22 January 2007,"The direct descendant of 70s backwoods horrors The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, The Hills Have Eyes and Deliverance (which even gets a name check at one point in the movie), Wrong Turn sees a group of stranded travellers coming face-to-face with a bunch of cannibalistic redneck inbred mutants.And whilst it may have a bigger budget, an overall glossier sheen, and a script that is perhaps a mite more predictable than its predecessors, this gory offering from director Rob Schmidt has plenty to recommend it. For starters, the cast are easy on the eye: Desmond Herrington and Jeremy Sisto seem to be popular with the girls, whilst those of us who prefer the fairer sex can enjoy the plentiful charms of Lindy Booth, Emmanuelle Chriqui and Eliza Dushku. (unfortunately, all three babes ignore that basic horror ruleget nekkid as often as possiblebut still look great in their skimpy outfits!).The film also scores fairly high in the gore department, with dismembered corpses, axe attacks and impalements aplenty to keep those who enjoy blood 'n' guts more than happy. The effects, courtesy of Stan Winston's crew, are top-notch (and occasionally very graphic).The action moves along at a fairly nippy pace, with a particularly good middle act, which sees the remaining survivors trapped in a deserted watch tower. Of course, there are no prizes for guessing who survives and who dies, or for guessing that not all of the hillbillies are dead at the end (another basic horror ruleleave the possibility for a sequel), but this matters not, for there is so much fun to be had with Wrong Turn that it is easy to be forgiving about such things.",Wrong Turn
9,dbdumonteil,Wrong turn indeed!,1,26 October 2008,"This is the kind of flick the horror movie buff has already seen a hundred times or more.A parboiled cross between ""the Texas chainsaw massacre "" and ""Friday the thirteenth"" and........ (fill in the blank). Good-looking boys and girls meet horrible blood thirsty monsters (shall we call them men?).Can someone tell me why the villains are almost always (very)ugly and the victims are always hunks and babes?One can save ,at a pinch ,a good moment:it happens when the desperate group take refuge on the watchtower (which is at once a refuge and a place from which you can't escape).During these precious minutes,the viewer feels ill-at-ease and can identify with them.As for the rest,as I cannot say something nice....",Wrong Turn
10,Coventry,Not your ordinary high school slasher...,6,25 July 2003,"whei! whei! whei! ...that's about all I've learned so far by reading the reviews on Wrong Turn. Don't get me wrong, not only here at IMDb but also the external reviews from people who are supposed to be ""Professional"" movie critics. Give this movie a break ! It isn't nearly as awful as everyone says it is. It actually is good considering it's a nu-horror film in the post Scream era. Most insults towards this movie are about the fact it's a ripoff from ultimate classics like The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Deliverance and The Hills have Eyes... So ? As far as I'm concerned, Wrong Turn never tried to be unique and original. The director clearly wanted to make an enjoyable movie and maybe even a sort of tribute to the previous mentioned titles. Nothing more nothing less ! I mean, come on people, this movie even refers to the classics. In my opinion, this means they're not ashamed to admit where they searched their inspiration.Wrong Turn does exactly what it has to do. Scare the viewers at the times they don't see it coming. And pretty good, too! I have to admit I was rather negative minded in the beginning as well. I hate the horror movies made after the ( also horrible ) scream trilogy. It's all the same isn't it. A ""mysterious"" killer, mostly in a stupid outfit, goes after good looking teenagers in high school and slashes them. Same story here, except the psychopaths are in fact inbreed cannibals. You don't know anything about them...they only make yummy noises and that they make Jason Vorhees look like Mr. Universe. The music is good and the sound effects leave very less to the imagination. If you see this film with a good dolby surround sound system, you'll have the impression the axes swing by your own ears. All this make this film 90 min of pure entertainment. One last praising word towards leading actress Eliza Dushku...She sure can act and I hope she once will be a great actress respected by everyone. She's amazingly beautiful and she doesn't have to show much of her gorgeous body to be sexy. Oh, and a special word of thanks to the director and crew for not letting romantic crap ( like a final love scene before the hunted get killed for example ) spoil the atmosphere of the movie.",Wrong Turn
11,michaelRokeefe,A traveler's worst nightmare.,7,4 September 2005,"Asking for directions is not always helpful. Jessie(Eliza Dushku)and four of her friends are on their way for a weekend of camping, when their vehicle blows a tire. Chris(Desmond Harrington)happens to be using the same West Virginia back-road, when he swerves to miss road-kill and smashes into the camper's SUV. The accident leaves the group lost and desperate and soon they become prey of cannibalistic, disfigured, in-bred mountain men. The six stranded people split up in hopes of getting out of the woods alive. The discovery of a dilapidated old house is no safe haven...but a waiting room to hell. Gruesome gore and very graphic violence may just turn your stomach and take your breath away. Dushku is impressive that she is not the typical ""girlie-girl"", when it comes to crisis and a deadly chase. She doesn't fall down crying and submitting. She proves able to kick some ass. Oh yes...she is more than an eyeful. Also in the cast are: Kevin Zegers, Lindy Booth, Jeremy Sisto, Ted Clark and Emmanuelle Chriqui. WRONG TURN is not a wrong move.",Wrong Turn
12,hitchcockthelegend,"It fits a certain criteria, but it's really same old same old formula.",5,11 October 2011,"Wrong Turn is directed by Rob Schmidt and primarily written by Alan B. McElroy. It stars Desmond Harrington, Eliza Dushku, Emmanuelle Chriqui and Jeremy Sisto. Plot finds a group of pretty young adults being menaced by inbred critters in West Virginia.Clocking in at under one hour and twenty minutes in length, Wrong Turn doesn't have time to become boring, that is; it doesn't become boring for the easily pleased stalk and slash fan. Film wastes no time in getting to the nitty gritty of its being, no time for character build up, our group of models, excuse me, characters, are stuck in the wilderness and most of them will meet a horrible death. Who will survive? If anyone? Will you care either way come the end? Well it seems many people were happy with what they saw, for although it flopped at the box office, film gained a big fan-base upon its home format release. So much so it has spawned three sequels thus far! Wrong Turn isn't an awful movie, it's just a very unadventurous one. A number of screenwriters were attached to it, and it shows, because it seems that each one plucked out an idea from a favourite horror movie of yesteryear and filled out the running time with formula, Hills Have Eyes: Check, Texas Chain Saw Massacre: Check, Deliverance: Check. Granted there's some good moments of tension, and one particularly excellent kill up in a tree, but the whole thing is distinctly unfresh so as to be annoying. Cast are fine, given the staid direction and dullard screenplay they are working from, though they make laughably bad decisions and do implausible stuff. One sequence involving leaping from a building onto a tree is so bad, particularly Dushku's side on approach, I'm surprised Schmidt wasn't sacked for incompetence!It rounds out about average and is a decent enough time filler for the slasher faithful, but if you are looking for anything new and exciting you best steer down a different road. 5/10",Wrong Turn
13,Hey_Sweden,"""May I remind you of a little movie called 'Deliverance'?""",8,27 April 2013,"""Wrong Turn"" doesn't get any rewards for originality, admittedly; those who have seen ""The Texas Chain Saw Massacre"" and/or ""The Hills Have Eyes"" know what to expect. It's what director Rob Schmidt does with the material that matters. He makes sure that it never stops moving. It's equal parts action-packed and suspenseful, and hopefully you get so caught up in it that you don't stop to think about it until it's over.The set-up is comfortingly familiar for horror fans: six people are stranded in the West Virginia woods (the movie was actually shot in Ontario, Canada) by the local antagonists: a trio of inbred mutated redneck humanoids who are big, ugly, fast, and sadistic. The balance of the movie basically amounts to one intense chase as the freaks try to get their hands (or arrows, or what have you) on our potential victims.Of course, these kinds of movies aren't typically actors' movies, but the performers do what they have to do well enough. Desmond Harrington as Chris is the kind of stoic hero whom we all need in such times of stress, Eliza Dushku looks stunning in her white T shirt and proves herself a strong and capable character, Emmanuelle Chriqui is stuck in the role of the whining, annoying character whose demise the audience eagerly anticipates, and Jeremy Sisto is likable in his part. Lindy Booth and Kevin Zegers likewise are entertaining in their brief time on screen. The guys playing the rednecks are fun: Julian Richings, the janitor from ""Urban Legend"", Garry Robbins, the beast from ""Humongous"", and Ted Clark (""Happy Hell Night"").The makeup effects and gore are courtesy of the Stan Winston Studio; Winston also takes a producer credit. The movie is fairly exciting at times, with such memorable episodes as the one in the watchtower and the subsequent one of the pursuit through the tree tops. The filmmakers make great use out of the various locations, and do their best to give the viewers their moneys' worth.This is a solid, agreeable diversion that should appeal to genre fans. In any event, it's amusing to see this turn into an ongoing franchise, with four sequels to date.Eight out of 10.",Wrong Turn
14,preppy-3,OK for a rainy day,4,14 May 2006,"Chris Flynn (Desmond Harrington) is driving through West Virginia for a job interview. While driving through the woods he (accidentally) runs into a group of friends whose car is broken down. They go for help and find themselves face to face with a group of inbred cannibals...and they're stuck in the middle of nowhere....So-so. The plot has been done MANY times in the past--this turns into a variation of ""The Hills Have Eyes"" (which I didn't like). The acting is OK I guess, but no one is given anything to work with. Harrington and Eliza Dushku try. On the plus side this moves fairly quick (it's only 84 minutes), delivers the goods in terms of gore and violence (one murder made me jump) and Dushku plays a strong intelligent woman who fights back full force. But there's nothing really new here. Worth watching on a rainy afternoon if you have NOTHING else to view. I give it a 4.",Wrong Turn
15,poolandrews,"Decent backwoods horror, better than expected.",8,8 September 2006,"Wrong Turn starts as Chris Flynn (Desmond Harrington) becomes stuck in a large traffic jam somewhere in the isolated wilderness of a West Virginian highway, he needs to be at a meeting so he decides to take a shortcut through the woods. It's a decision that turns out to be a bad move as first he crashes his car into a jeep leaving himself & the jeeps passengers, five teenage friends Jessie (Eliza Dushku), Carly (Emmanuelle Chriqui) & Scott (Jeremy Sisto) plus Evan (Kevin Zegers) & Francine (Lindy Booth) out on a camping trip, stranded in the middle of nowhere with no transport & no reception for their mobile phones. Their misery doesn't end there though, as if that wasn't enough it soon becomes apparent that there is a retarded, inbred family of deformed cannibalistic mutants living in the woods who slaughter & eat anyone they come across. Bummer, sometimes it just isn't your day...This American German co-production was directed by Rob Schmidt & I can vividly remember seeing it when it originally came out a few years ago & not being impressed with it (in fact I gave the DVD to my friend Kelly) but it was on TV last night in a convenient time slot so I decided to give it another go & I have totally changed my mind as this time I really liked it, I don't exactly know what has changed (maybe my expectations were much lower this time) but I now think it's a pretty damn good horror. The script by Alan McElroy moves along like a rocket, almost no screen time is wasted & that makes for a fast paced pretty exciting horror. The character's all have just about enough personality to care for them without us (thankfully) having to know their entire life story. On the negative side the film is very one dimensional & basic, I think you could write the basic premise on the back of a postage stamp & there is virtually no explanation as to who the killers are, why they kill people because if it was purely for meat why not just kill animals, it would be a lot safer wouldn't it? They don't seem to do it for 'sport' either so there really isn't any reason to their actions. To be fair during the opening credits there is a montage of newspaper clippings that talk about inbreeding, genetic mutations & mountain men but when a film plays a main plot device 'under' the opening credits & then never mentions it again you know your not in for a particularly intellectual viewing experience. Still, at least it gets the boring exposition out of the way early on & concentrates on the important stuff like killing people, who needs a story anyway?Director Schmidt does a good job, the film has some cool sequences. There is a nice isolated exploitation atmosphere to the whole thing although there is some silly stuff in it. For instance you cannot fall from a cliff & live, or out of a 30 foot tree & survive. The ending also takes the horror film cliché 'he's not dead yet' to ridiculous levels, I think these guys must be bullet & fireproof. Why does the mutant at the end wait to attack Chris? Why wait until Chris has killed the other one? It doesn't make sense as I'd have thought two inbred cannibalistic mutants are better than one in a fight to the death than one... I have to say I was a bit disappointed with the gore on show, there is a severed ear, a few mutilated dead bodies, an arrow stuck in someones head, an arrow in someones back & the best scene in which someone has half their head sliced off with an axe which is accompanied by a cool camera angle/shot. Overall I was hoping for a little bit more...With a supposed budget of about $10,000,000 Wrong Way has that Hollywood polish about it & is very well made throughout, the special make-up effects are excellent, some of the CGI forest effects less so. The acting was pretty good actually & I have no real complaints here.Wrong Turn is a great horror film, I think it will appeal to modern audiences as it moves along like a rocket, it has the obligatory teenage cast, little in the way of story & some good kill scenes. A good film that I definitely recommend & I was surprised how much I enjoyed it yesterday.",Wrong Turn
16,lastliberal,We are never going into the woods again!,6,12 December 2008,"I loves me a good horror movie, even if it is one that I have seen before with another title. Running through the wood to escape some inbred cretin is so overused, but at least they did this one in West by god Virginny, rather than another in Texas.Do you think that maybe, just maybe the word has gotten out now to stay on the damn highway. Do not go into the wood looking for trees where they hung the devil, or shortcuts, or places to have a nice picnic. Stay on the highway people! Well, they didn't listen again, and they get to pay the price - the ax in the mouth was precious.Eliza Dushku certainly made this worth watching. I would gladly follow her into the woods.

17,zardoz-13,"""Deliverance"" Meets ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre!""",7,17 June 2009,"The reception that three inbred, illiterate, cannibalistic hillbillies prepare for Eliza Duskhu, Desmond Harrington, and Jeremy Sisto in ""Crime and Punishment in Suburbia"" director Rob Schmidt's horror chiller ""Wrong Turn"" probably doesn't illustrate the kind of southern hospitality that the West Virginia Bureau of Tourist wants to see displayed by their citizens to visitors. Six ill-fated white motorists find themselves stranded on a remote back road in rural Greenbriar Country with a trio of murderous, ghoulish-looking, flesh-feasting fiends nipping at their heels. Schmidt openly admits on the DVD director's commentary track that ""Wrong Turn"" represents his homage to John Boorman's ""Deliverance,"" Tobe Hooper's ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre,"" and Wes Craven's ""The Hills Have Eyes."" Further, Schmidt admits he adores those 1970s' horror spinetinglers that are played in a straightforward manner without comic relief. The laughs are far from comical in this above-average, but strictly formulaic shocker. Naturally, Canada substitutes plausibly for the West Virginia woods, and ""Wrong Turn"" boasts an appealing cast, Stan Winston's first-rate effects, and some genuinely atmospheric suspense. The highlight is the death of a law enforcement official from an arrow that skewers his head through his left eye, and a girl hiding in a tree who takes a hatchet in the mouth just as she is about to scream. Eventually, the rest of her body detaches from her head and plummets to the ground below.""Wrong Turn"" opens appropriately enough with two climbers, a twentysomething male and his girlfriend. The guy ascends a rock wall while his girlfriend struggles to join him. Suddenly, he falls down dead and droplets of blood speckle her and she winds up falling to the foot of the rock wall where her unfortunate boyfriend has toppled. When she tries to run for their vehicle, she is tripped up and the rest is left to your vivid imagination. The scene switches to Chris Flynn (Desmond Harrington of ""Ghost Ship"") tooling along the highway to Raleigh for a 7 pm interview. He comes to a halt behind a long line of vehicle that are waiting for the authorities to clear the highway of a tanker wreck. In a hurry to reach Raleigh, Chris reverses and cruises off to an exit to find a detour. He winds up at a dilapidated convenience, reads a map, and drives off onto a dirt road and comes to a fork. He takes Bear Mountain Road. Distracted by a deer carcass on the side of the road, he slams into an SUV parked in the middle of the road. Scott (Jeremy Sisto of ""May""), Carly (Emmanuelle Chriqui of ""Detroit Rock City""), Evan (Kevin Zegers of ""Transamerica""), and Francine (Lindy Booth of ""Nobel Son"") are just as shocked as he is. Chris has torn up his classic Mustang. He asks them why they are parked in the road and Jessie (Eliza Dushku of ""Tru Calling"") makes her entrance with barbed wire in her fists. She informs everybody that barbed wire had been strung across the road to stop them.Scott, Carly, Chris, and Jessie set off on foot to find help. Meanwhile, Francine and Evan remain with the vehicles. Predictably, the cannibals pick them off. Meanwhile, our quartet discovers a large wooden house in the middle of the woods surrounded by the hulks of automobiles. Chris lets himself inside. What they find within the house sickens them and about that time an old tow truck trundles up to the house. Our heroes hide themselves in the house while the inbred, rednecks, Saw-tooth (Garry Robbins of ""Narc""), One-Eye (Ted Clark of ""Turn It Up""), and Three Finger (Julian Richings of ""Saw IV"") carry in Francine's near dead body. Later, after they have feasted on Francine and lay down for a nap, our heroes slip out from under the bed and try to leave without awakening them. Chris seizes the spring that pulls the front screen door shut and tries to suppress the sound, but he is too late. Three Finger awakens and the pursuit begins. Scott tries to lead the hillbillies away from his companions so that they can steal the truck that the threesome has left idling as they approach our protagonists. Three Finger wounds Chris in the leg, but Jessie and Carly help him steal the idling tow truck. Scott leads the rednecks on a chase through the woods and almost reaches Chris, Jessie, and Carly, but Saw-tooth kills him with several arrows.Our survivors spent the rest of them being chased by the killers. At one point, they take refuge in a fire tower, but the villains burn them out. They leap from the flaming tower into the nearby trees. Before they abandon the fire tower, they manage to raise an individual on the radio. The villains murder Carly, but Chris and Jessie elude them. Eventually, a lawman shows up, nearly colliding with Chris in the road. When Chris explains his predicament, Saw-tooth unleashes an arrow and it penetrates the lawman's left eye and protrudes from the back of his head. The rednecks capture Jessie, take her home, and tie her down. Chris climbs up under the lawman's SUV and hangs on as the hillbillies drive it back to their house. Everything concludes in a blaze as Chris appropriates the SUV and crashes it into the house, rescues Jessie, kills two of them, and sets the house on fire.Essentially, Schmidt possesses a solid sense of timing so that ""Wrong Turn"" never makes a wrong turn. Hardcore horror fanatics will savor this low-budget blood opera. ""Wrong Turn"" is neither as bloodthirsty as the ""Saw"" franchise or as sadistic of ""Cannibal Holocaust."" Scenarist Alan B. McElroy, who penned Ballistic: Ecks vs. Sever,"" doesn't deviate from terror. Indeed, the cannibals whittle the six down to two, but the hero and the heroine survive after running a gauntlet. Schmidt and McElroy provide several surprises as well as false alarms through this nimble 84 minute flick that doesn't wear out its welcome.",Wrong Turn
18,grantss,One of the better inbred-hillbilly horror-thrillers (not that this says too much),6,14 May 2016,"Chris Flynn is driving through the backwoods of West Virginia on the way to an interview when he has an accident with a group of five friends, writing off his car. Their car is also damaged, so four of them set off to find help, leaving two behind to watch the cars. One by one they get picked off by a bunch of mutated inbred hillbillies.One of the better inbred-hillbilly horror-thrillers (not that this says too much). While the whole hillbilly-horror genre is incredibly formulaic, unoriginal and predictable (as is the horror genre in general), this has some degree of originality. Yes, there is a large degree of sticking to a formula but it does take turns you don't expect and is not that predictable - it does keep you in suspense, at least.One other indication that this is better than your average horror movie is the cast. Horror movies generally involve no-name actors/actresses that never amount to anything. Cheap B-grade movies are the furthest they'll get. Wrong Turn has three actors - Eliza Dushku, Emmanuelle Chriqui and Desmond Harrington - who went on to bigger and better things. Performances are decent (another turn up for the horror books), especially from those three.Certainly the best of the Wrong Turn movies. Since this movie there have been five more (and counting...) and all of them have been incredibly bad. Pretty much the same plot, over and over, and pretty much your standard hillbilly-horror stuff.

It does nothing too great but also does nothing too bad.You can certainly blame this movie for having a lack of originality in it. It's just one of those movies that has a simple concept, that serve as an excuses to put in some killings and gore. But the killings and gore themselves also really aren't that much special. It would had liked this movie definitely better if it had only not been more original but more creative as well.This movie does basically far too little with its premise. They could had definitely spiced up things a little by putting in some good, originally and creative killings. There is just nothing special now about the 'monsterous' killers and the way they get their victims. It's not really ever tense because the movie doesn't ever surprise. You can say a lot about '80's horror but at least back then they really knew how to kill its characters.This movie is being praised a lot for how gory and shocking it is but quite frankly I just can't agree. As far as the genre goes, this movie really isn't gory enough at all. It has some hints of it in it and it seems that the movie was at times slightly heading toward a torture-porn kind of approach, like for instance movies like ""Saw"" and ""Hostel"" were. It might also be due to the lack of originality and true creative that the gore just didn't worked out for me.But I guess that the movie is still being watchable enough to those who are really into the genre. It's definitely not an horrible movie to watch but I just wished it had some more originality to offer.5/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Wrong Turn

They run around in the woods, chased by aforementioned inbreds. There is not really any surprises in this, it uses the usual shock scares rather than really building up any decent suspense. There is hardly a scene where you can't guess the outcome, if you know the slasher genre. The killers are less scary(to me, at least) than the average slasher killer(s), as they throw and shoot to attack, rather than slashing and stabbing. The ending lacked the usual intensity of usual slashers. The killers are, as expected, unrealistically strong, seemingly impossible to kill, and, something reasonably new to slashers, horribly disfigured. The movie does present an attempt at an explanation for this, but it doesn't make it any more believable. The plot is OK. The acting is substandard, especially Eliza Dushku. The characters are horribly underdeveloped, and half or their actions seem more or less unbelievable. In the end, this is just a standard, not particularly entertaining, teen-horror-slasher movie. I only recommend this to people who really love this type of films. It really is nothing special. 5/10",Wrong Turn

One of the film's better features here is the fact that there's a hugely enjoyable atmospheric touch here provided by the forest setting that makes this one so much fun here. This one really plays up the creepy and foreboding woods right from the outset here as the lush vegetation and dense tree-lines really give this a really beautiful, majestic air that's quite chilling as well. It's a nearly perfect playground for a backwoods-set slasher like this as there's plenty to like about those moments, starting with the tense and rather thrilling house escape chase back into the woods once they've realized the family's there as they go into the woods and stumble upon the deserted car park which is another stellar series of encounters trying to get away. A later attack in the forest as they attempt to get away and another highlight effort where they get trapped in a lookout tower and must fend off their assaults while the killers light the whole effort on fire and forcing them out into the treetops for a fine series of encounters and are able to battle back quite nicely. As well, there's the other really good encounter out on the road where they get ambushed along the roadside and leading to a highly enjoyable brawl where she gets abducted as well as the one rather brutal kill that sets up the finale here as the attempt to reclaim her features a slew of high-end action brawling around their compound leading to the final confrontation in the burning house which is rather exciting as well as adding in some brutal kills along the way. This is also helped rather nicely by the opening walk-through of their abandoned house which gives this a creepy, chilling vibe here with the scattered remnants of their collected items, broken-up belongings and scattered human remains stuck littering the grounds and gives this such a terrifying tone right at the beginning to really make for a dark, brutal slasher. Coupled with the nice gory kills and some imposing villains, there's a lot to really like here as this one has only a single detrimental element bout it. This one is really only hurt by one small fact in that there's a huge missed opportunity in having the group split up as early as they are which really creates an offbeat pace. By keeping the group so small and then killing off that many in the first stages, it causes such a long break between them that there are stretches without tension as they have to escape in order to keep the plot going. Likewise, these kills are all off-screen and then shown the aftermath afterward which is rather disappointing. This here is the only real flaw to this one.Rated R: Graphic Violence and Graphic Language.",Wrong Turn

I can also see why people from West Virginia had a problem with this flick.  Had it merely been set in WV I would have said what is the big deal, but the makers of the film seem to make a point of telling us it occurs in West Virginia.

Then the victims do what all good horror movie victims do, the stupidest things possible to assure they all get killed. They are hiding in the killers' house, and sneak out while the killers are sleeping, our heroes could have easily killed all these guys in their sleep, but they proceed to try and sneak out and of course wake them up.

26,Wuchakk,Worthwhile lost-in-the-woods slasher flick,5,13 March 2014,"2003's ""Wrong Turn"" tells the story of a dude who turns down the wrong dirt road in the backcountry of West Virginia and runs into five other youths (literally). They soon discover they are prey to inbred hillbillies who may be mutant and resistant to pain. Will they get out alive? My wife's response to the film was a disturbed ""I'm never going in the woods again!"" By contrast, I felt it was entertaining and compelling but not scary or horrifying. Why? Because, although the story is presented in a serious, non-campy manner it's not realistic. The reason ""Deliverance"" (1972) was so unsettling is because the story actually COULD happen. ""Wrong Turn"" starts out this way but becomes increasingly unbelievable as the story unravels. Hence, unlike ""Deliverance,"" I could never buy that I was viewing a potential reality.Yet it starts out with enough believability that I was drawn into the story and the characters. By the time the unrealistic stuff starts happening it didn't matter because the film successfully captures and maintains your attention. It's not a great film by any means, but it's decent for what it is, a slasher-in-the-woods flick.I'm not usually a fan of slasher flicks in general, nor am I a gorehound, but I do love the ""Friday the 13th"" movies and films of the same ilk. I enjoy the youthful casts and the deep woods setting. It brings fond memories of my younger years (camping, hiking, etc.). The fact that there's a mad killer(s) on the loose just adds excitement and suspense. However, I never find these films scary. Fun? Yes. A little creepy? Yes. A few shocking moments? Yes. Scary or horrifying? No. But my wife obviously disagrees because, again, she never wants to go in the woods again, lol.""Wrong Turn"" was filmed in Dundas and Uxbridge, Ontario, with additional footage shot in Toronto and Hamilton (which I'm assuming is studio work since there are no urban scenes in the film). This area of Ontario has deep forests but is largely flat as many of the geographical-overlook shots reveal, but there are a couple of shots where you'll see hills in the background (which I'm not sure are authentic or cgi). There's also some nice footage of cliffs and a waterfall at the 1 hour 5 minute mark that I really enjoyed. These locations are fine but it would have been better if they actually filmed in Appalachia (it's only about 500 miles south of Ontario, after all).As far as the cast goes, Desmond Harrington is a great leading male protagonist. He has character and isn't a smart-axx delinquent. He should go on to better things. Eliza Dushku is good as his main companion, not to mention easy on the eyes, although she has no booty (maybe if she ate more). Jeremy Sisto and Emmanuelle Chriqui are also good protagonists. It's just nice to have a group of people you can care about and root for, rather than a bunch of unappealing and crude punks, if you know what I mean.Another good thing about the film is it only runs an hour and 20 minutes before the credits role. Movies like this should't go on too long; it's unnecessary. Speaking of the credits, they feature a really good modern rock/metal song.One other aspect I enjoyed is a 10-15 minute sequence that takes place high up in the trees at night as three of the kids try to evade the hillbillies (which I'm assuming was shot in the studio, but I'm not sure). The sequence isn't believable at all but it is quite original. I wasn't expecting that.GRADE: C+",Wrong Turn

Well, these monstrous in-bred cannibals who are behind it. They don't seem to have any other motive but killing and eating humans. Of course, there are the usual questions about how these humans become inhumane in the first place by inbreeding. They live worse than animals and are cut off from the civilized world according to their living circumstances. I would have liked to know more about the background rather than the gruesomeness of their crimes but of course then it would take the fun out of horror. After all, the movie wouldn't be anything but sheer entertainment. The monsters slowly appear and lack human identity. They sleep and hunt for their meals.

That is exactly what Rob Schmidt's horror film Wrong Turn does. It has its typical side, with the formula and pretty dense characters, but it also has its creative side, showing off impressive camera-work, cinematography, and very amusing effects work. It is, what some might call, a joyous bloody excursion.The story's plot is standard fare; a rushed man (Washington) takes an unexpected detour to avoid heavy traffic and collides with a group of teenagers who are sex-crazed, pot-smoking goofballs who have got a flat tire. There's no signal, no gas station for miles, so some of them inevitably start walking. It is too inevitable that some will stay put and wind up getting hacked to bits by deranged, backwoods lunatics, who play by their own rules. Their own rules involve jumping, screaming, running around senselessly, and shooting anything that moves.One will say that Wrong Turn is just simple horror fluff, resurrected on every horror cliché. In a way, they're not wrong. The film has more going for it than a lot of other modern pieces. It's 2003, and the seventies style of horror seemed dead. Films didn't want to go back to the past to see what made films like The Hills Have Eyes and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre special. Director Rob Schmidt did. He went back and followed a blueprint once used by classic seventies horror. The turnout doesn't involve any audience-winks, pointless sex scenes, or implausible irony. It's sophisticated and sometimes even wholly creepy.I think the main reason for its creepy-vibe is the fact that the film knows the importance of suspense and atmosphere. We get some pretty decent buildup before the inevitable kill, and the delightful unease of the woodsy setting is utilized very well. Similar to how Eli Roth evoked atmosphere and setting to tell his story in Cabin Fever. The only problem was, with that film, the payoff was a little loose and short. Here, Wrong Turn doesn't stop at look, and tries to go the extra mile.If anything, the film is entertaining. Short, dark, entertaining, and interesting. It's too bad the film didn't want to go for the full look of a seventies picture, by adding film grain and dirt to the lens to give the appearance of a cheap Grindhouse film. I could see that intensifying the whole experience, making it scarier than it currently is.

The plot basically follows a guy who takes a different route to get to his destination and ends up crashing into a car, luckily no one was in the car he crashed into and the people stranded team up with him after they find out that psycho hillbilly mutants are trying to catch them kill them and eat them. ""Wrong Turn"" had the right elements to make a great slasher film, the premise was good, even had a decent setting and the killers are down right creepy. But a lot of other factors falls short and it just becomes a generic slasher movie with stereotypical cast for this type of genre. From the annoying chick that drags everyone down with her, to the hero that puts everyone above himself, to the smart chick that kicks butt, to a couple of annoying pot heads. And a lot of them wasn't likable although some may disagree, as a matter of fact at the beginning of the film I was rooting for the mutated hillbilly psychos to quickly wipe out the annoying cast members, in till it was left with the cast that isn't as annoying. Especially the Bono wannabe that doesn't add anything to the film but be annoying and become a whinny little prick, he didn't even add anything to the blood and gore so overall he was a lame character. But the most annoying character of them all was this Indian looking girl, although I don't know her exact ethnicity she was really annoying to the point it gets aggravating. Besides the fact that she makes suggestions that will get everyone killed, she stops in the middle of running to say ""Oh I can't do this, I can't"" and she starts whining and throwing a tantrum like a kid, a spoiled little brat. But do the rest of the people that are trying to survive leave her? No they treat her like a little kid and keep trying to convince her to run. They should have just said ""Okay, stay there and die than"" and that would have shut her up and got her to stop complaining and wouldn't have dragged the rest of them down, but no it does not go that way and they keep encouraging her. Than she goes back to throwing a tantrum and wanting to kill herself, when they are in a watch tower. What they should of done was throw her out the window, cause not only was she dragging down the rest that are trying to survive but she really irritates the heck out of the audiences. These types of characters are okay if they get finished off early, but she actually lasts a while and says stuff like ""Oh God! There no point in trying, we are all going to die!"". Another flaw of this film is that the cast is too small and I usually don't have a problem with this type of scenario, but it just gets way too obvious who is going to live and who is going to die. The characters aren't even well developed and they talk about stupid and uninteresting stuff from the beginning just to drag on the running time of this short film. And although the premise was good, the environment was didn't have a scary atmosphere. Despite some flaws, the film did have some entertaining scenes, even if the murders were pretty sparse, not creative and very quick. The half hour build up was okay, and a predictable ending that comes next after. It might be a gripping film for some that just about any girl or people with weak stomach can handle.6.2/10",Wrong Turn
35,bensonmum2,"""We are never going into the woods again!""",7,26 August 2005,"A group of six young people find themselves stranded in the mountains of West Virginia. When four members of the group leave to find either help or a phone they stumble upon a cabin that at first appears to be deserted. But what they find in the cabin proves that it is actually inhabited and not the place they want to be when the owners return home. Just as they are making their exit, a truck pulls to the front of the house and three inbred mountain men enter the house carrying the dead, butchered bodies of their friends with them.What Works: Inbred Hillbillies. Movies with backwoods murderous inbred hillbillies have always fascinated me. Some of my favorite movies (The Hills Have Eyes, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, The Final Terror, etc.) feature this kind of character. These characters are frightening because you know they're based in reality. There really are people out there who look and, to a lesser extent, act like this. As a bonus, the make-up used on Three Finger, Saw-Tooth, and One-Eye is excellent. It's another argument in favor of traditional quality latex make-up.No Jokes. Other than a few bits of comedy that fit within the framework of the plot, Wrong Turn is played straight. Most movies made today with this many horror clichés would turn into one big self-referential jokefest. I'm glad Schmidt avoided going down this road. There is no attempt to go out of the way to create comedy or fill the movie with inappropriate one-liners that only serve to ruin mood and atmosphere.Scenes of Violence. I found many of the scenes of violence particularly well done. These inbred hillbillies are brutal and savage. They care not for human life. Their methods of killing are primitive but effective. One of my favorite scenes involves a bow, an arrow, and human eye. Nice! What Doesn't Work: It's Not West Virginia. My wife is from West Virginia and I've been there any number of times. I could tell almost immediately that the film wasn't actually made in West Virginia. I wasn't surprised to discover that the actual location was Ontario, Canada. If you're going to film a movie that is set in West Virginia, why not film it in West Virginia? This just bugged me throughout the entire movie.Why doesn't Eliza die? With the exception of Eliza Dushku's character, every other victim the inbreeds run across is immediately slaughtered. So why did they (or better yet, why does the script) treat Eliza differently? Why is she spared long enough to be rescued? Obviously I know the answer, but it's an inconsistency in Wrong Turn that I didn't appreciate.Wrong Turn is a nice throwback to the 70s movies I grew up with. It's vicious, raw, brutal, and a lot of fun. In short, it's my kind of horror movie.

Yep, that's what ""Wrong Turn"" just happens to be. Influences from such 70s survival grindhouse films like; ""The Hill Have Eyes (1977)"", ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974)"" and even ""Deliverance (1972)"" figure very prominently in the story. Sure, the plot's structure is plain derivative, but its not trying to be anything big. Really it just wants to get back to its primitive roots. It's a simple and entertaining stalk 'n' slash device of the old school horror and I thought it does it rather successfully. Although, in the long run its not quite so memorable, but still when it kicks into second gear after the somewhat slow opening, it does deliver the exciting and adrenaline packed goods one could only ask for. One thing you'll notice straight away is that it stays clear away from the self-referential material that was flooding horror pictures around the same time. There's some humorous dialogues, but it mostly plays the horror straight. This is what gives the film a breath of fresh air, but sadly it didn't have much of an impact on the box-office and disappeared rather quickly.FX guru Stan Winston produced this backwoods horror and got debut director Rob Schmidt to bring Alan McElroy's story to the screen.

Stan Winston and his FX crew came up with horrific looking brutes of mountain man, which have certain reality in the deformities and their own fierce personalities. Also some grisly make-up effects are mixed in with a slight dose of digital treatment. The violence isn't filled with explicit splatter, but there's a cruel and a touch of gore amongst the many inventive death scenes. Yeah, the deaths scenes are actually quite original (look at the treetop sequence) and far from easy to detect when they're about to come. The shocks are well integrated into the formulaic story because of such assured direction by Schmidt who's not afraid to get down and dirty with the psychical nature of the story. The interchangeable characters are nothing more then a stereotypical bunch waiting for their turn on the chopping board. Sadly I found the most interesting ones to be the ones to die first. Although the performances aren't too bad with Dushku as the bold, firebrand Jessie and Desmond Harrington's gritty Chris. The only character that annoyed the hell out of me was Emmanuelle Chriqui's whiny ""I can't do it!"" Carly. Now the script they had to work with was kinda flabby and quite leaden, but they did well by not letting it take over. Story wise, there's not much there to hold a story with, as it clocks up just less than 80 minutes. It covers every cliché and has plenty of loose ends, but there is decent bloodletting and a couple of good suspenseful spurts that makes the time go by quick. The film is fluidly shot and very well mounted and the petering score sprung up a belting rhythm.It's not going to win any awards and shake new ground, but it's a well-grounded and meaty horror flick without any pretentious marks.",Wrong Turn
38,bowmanblue,Competent little horror,6,20 December 2016,"'Wrong Turn.' If you're into your horror flicks you've probably heard of it, if not the original then one of the – numerous – lesser sequels it managed to spawn. And, like with so many films, the sequels were all poor imitations of the original. Although 'Wrong Turn' was just about as generic as it could possibly be, it still contains enough charm to make it worth a watch – if you're into your slasher stuff.I'm going to talk about it now and you'll probably think that I hate it, however I don't. For a start, the plot is about as tired as they come – a group of youngsters are stranded and fall foul to the local nutters. The characters are paper-thin and the bad-guys are those clichéd inbred lot you get in so many horror films simply because you can tell they're bonkers just by looking at them. They don't need any form of backstory to explain their villainous behaviour – you just know they're the bad guys and they're going to be notoriously difficult to kill.Our gorgeous set of 'mutant-bait' is headed up by Eliza Dushku ('Faith' from Buffy, but kind of after she was famous) and Desmond Harrington (not yet that well known at the time, but probably most remembered now as 'Joey Quinn' from the Dexter TV series). Anyway, they're about the only two you'll really know. The rest are unknowns and barely have a definable character trait between them.Naturally, not all our heroes make it out alive, but the kills are hardly ingenious – they're okay, but nothing that special and there isn't that much gore either if you're watching for the red stuff.So, all in all, Wrong Turn is nothing that you haven't seen before (assuming you've seen one single slasher film). However, it's short and sweet – and that's something. It never gets bogged down with anything other than the constant chase between prey and hunter. Yes, some parts are unbelievable and it succumbs to almost every horror cliché going, but, if you're into your horror films this one is at least vaguely entertaining enough to warrant the hour and a quarter it takes up. Just don't bother with any of the sequels. Seriously.",Wrong Turn
39,CuriosityKilledShawn,"Nothing new, but does it with style",7,2 May 2006,"Youths being killed one by one, a killer in the woods, stalk and slash, mutated cannibals...it's all been done a hundred times before. But not always as effectively and brutally as Wrong Turn. It's all in the execution folks, quite literally.Chris Flynn (the always intense looking Desmond Harrington) is a Doctor on his way to an appointment across the other side of the country. A chemical spill and crash on the freeway means 2 hours of waiting in traffic and being late. Keen to avoid this, Chris takes a dirt road along Bear Mountain hoping to cut back onto the freeway some miles ahead of the jam. I bet he wishes he didn't.This wrong turn causes him to smash into an already wasted people carrier. The owners are a bunch of mountain bikers who have had their tires shredded by barb-wire lain by apparent hillbillies.Chris and three others (Eliza Dushku, Jeremy Sisto and the very annoying Emmanuelle Chriqui) decide to walk to the nearest phone while a moronic and deserving-to-die boyfriend and girlfriend (Kevin Zegers and Lindy Booth, who also met a similar fate in Dawn of the Dead) stay behind to guard the cars.That couple don't last very long and the only dwelling the quartet stumble upon is the disgusting house of a bunch of ferocious, inbred, cannibalistic mountain men. It's filled with the stolen belongings of people they've already massacred, but no one picks up on this until the men suddenly return.It's clear from the outset who's going to live and who's going to die. Chris is strong-willed and level-headed and responds to intense situations with logic and cunning, while most of the others do stupid things and do all but paint a bullseye on their forehead.Shot and directed with an atmospheric color pallet, a fair amount of tension, some grisly kills and lots of quick, nervous cuts (without turning into confusion), Wrong Turn succeeds where most other wannabe horrors that fall into the same sub-genre fail. In the post-Scream world horror movies were all about irony and smart-ass. Wrong Turn wisely includes neither. Currently horror movies are all about remakes, with one remake coming out every other week. Wrong Turn isn't exactly a remake either, but, like I said it IS a story that's been done almost to death.In the end, it cannot be a great movie. But just a very-well done potboiler that does exactly what it set out to do. So many horror films fail because someone behind the scenes fails to take it seriously, I'm pleased to say that ain't the case with this movie.",Wrong Turn

42,johnnyboyz,"Just fails to be enough to recommend but Wrong Turn offers plenty of gore, suspense and general adventure.",5,2 June 2008,"The hostility that the apparent locales have toward the out of towners makes itself known very early on in Wrong Turn with the first example occurring during a traffic jam on a main road. Chris Flynn (Harrington) asks a truck driver what the problem is and gets a reply somewhere in the region that he should 'go and fix his hair one more time'. But the truck driver cannot be local because he is a long distance driver I'm sure, although one thing he certainly is is from the Southern area of America and omits a certain hostility to the good looking, rich and smart 'other' American. It is a battle that will be fought out over the next 80-odd minutes in a bloody and somewhat disturbing manner reminiscent of all those 1970s survivor/slasher films and possibly with limp implications to the Civil War.Make no mistake that while Wrong Turn was fun for what it was, there was too much familiar ground being re-tread and too many incidences involving the character of Carly (Chriqui) for me to actually stand up and say 'Yeah, this was a pretty decent film'. That's right, the mere inclusion of one character was enough for me to take away a negative opinion of the film because Carly as a whole and any scene involving Carly is just downright awful. In fact she's so bad in saying and doing the exact wrong thing at exactly the wrong time that I actually assumed for the best part that she was included for comic relief  not a good sign. But ignoring her and looking at Wrong Turn as a whole; you have a decent and well made, nicely unfolded film about a group of people that are just simply out of their depth. If Deliverance and The Texas Chain Saw Massacre were the pioneers of putting either mature city folk or immature teenage stoners in the backwater lands of deep south America then Wrong Turn is more of a 'nod' than a step in a new direction. But there's nothing wrong with that if done well.And Wrong Turn is done well, albeit the inclusion of Carly being a major factor in whether or not you can enjoy and appreciate the film fully. It is not like she makes a huge difference to the narrative so the inclusion isn't that necessary but even then, by all means include her but keep her quiet. The film has a strong male lead and a strong female lead in Jessie (Dushku), a girl who wasn't initially going on a camping trip with three of her friends and thus perhaps isn't really a part of those campers circles. But after the sexually active ones have perished and there are a few quick, unpredictable deaths here and there you realise that both Jessie and Chris are good people and you realise you are in danger of actually recognising them as characters  scary stuff for this genre and something that hasn't really been done as effectively in a film of this nature since Wolf Creek.I think Wrong Turn's overall message is 'don't venture of the beaten track'. It doesn't demonise travelling and it will not deter people from going to Virginia in the same way Hostel and Wolf Creek did for Australia and Slovakia, respectively and this is purely down to the uncanny characteristics the antagonist carry. The homicidal, cannibalistic creatures that inhabit the woods are 'things' with names and lives and appetites. They're called Three Finger (Richings); Saw-Tooth (Robbins) and One-Eye (Clark). The interesting thing here is that they represent a stone age version of mankind, a sort of monkey-like character from 2001: A Space Odyssey's prologue as they scuffle and strut around in search for food and fights. It is very much North vs. South in this film but it is also 'people' or things from an ancient world vs. people and things from a post-modern 2003 world.These creatures hunt and kill people for food rather than for the thrill of it (see Hostel and Wolf Creek) and bear strong resemblance to some sort of a tribal group than a bunch of psychos. Check the scene when the gang find the cabin: the creatures have organised piles of sunglasses and collections of car wrecks. But there is also one of those tacky 'prom queen' crowns that has been put with the other kitsch junk that signals the day and age we live in  it has been placed there because the creatures know no other place to put it. I feel this is the 'ancient' world clashing with the post-modern way of decorating oneself to signal hierarchy. But in the cabin the group find more disturbing things such as body remains and such. Upon seeing a jar full of teeth, Carly says 'Ewww(!)' in another example of why she should have been a mute character. Then there is the brilliant line in the watch tower: ""We don't know where we are, but help us(!)"" that was priceless. But Carly is also the sort of character who says she reads current affairs magazines but comes up with sentences like ""Be prepared to run me a bath and give me multiple orgasms!"" I wonder what her definition of a 'current affairs' magazine is.So even though Wrong Turn raises the issues of staying on the right road when in a foreign environment and brings to the party ideas about the ancient vs. the modern, it cannot act as anything more than a series of scenes offering cheap thrills as the heroes battle back and try to win through in the end. Carly says and does some of the most stupid things seen in a film this decade by any character but the director makes good use of his forest location and keeps the thrills and spills flowing. To some that is the most important thing.",Wrong Turn

Agree its nothing original, v already hav seen many like this n some superior ones like Texas chainsaw. ...., Hills hav.... n many other cannibal/inbred/hillbilly films but this film surprised me. It was really good. There is something very scary about lost in the woods n chased by hillbillies with brutal weapons. The director Schmidt kept the tension very high, constantly reminding us of both the isolation and the fact that civilization isn't that far away. The film has decent suspense, some nice tension when they're hiding in the cabin, a couple of nice jump moments and some really cool deaths one involving barb wire, a great tree-top cat and mouse game and a disturbing scene of desolated junkyard with discarded vehicles, most of which have blood splattered all over them and recognisable belongings spilling out of them, climbing ropes, picnic hampers, shoes, sunglasses, a child's doll.

46,insomniac_rod,Delivers more than expected.,7,21 November 2006,"Enjoyable light - exploitation movie that could also be considered a slasher. The premise is VERY well known. We have a group of teens (two males and three hot, very hot women) and another unfortunate traveler who couldn't get on time for a job appointment. A car crash is the event that units both destinations. Soon after this teens join forces, they are followed by a blood thirsty clan of deformed mutants who will torture them if possible. One by one this teens are killed and only two (or one?) of them will fight for his/her life. I really dug the plot of the movie even though it's a mix between ""The Hills Have Eyes"" and obviously ""The Texas Chain Saw Massacre"". The characters were likable; specially Elisa Dushku who portrays a brave, sexy girl. E. Chriqui is extremely beautiful and hot and delivers a decent performance. The male cast is also good.The gore is plenty and great. I didn't expect it to be that good I must admit. My advice is, if you want to get into exploitation, you should watch ""Wrong Turn"" as a beginners course. But if you just want an entertaining gory Horror movie, watch it anyways. I recommend it because it isn't as bad as many people say. Sure, it's slightly overrated but still deserves a watch. Also there's a room for tension because the movie has a dark atmosphere. No room for cheesiness. This is a fast paced violent movie with a big budget. Try it and you might surprise yourself.",Wrong Turn

48,Anonymous_Maxine,"Yes, that's exactly right. VERY wrong turn.",2,9 February 2004,"I am referring, of course, to the script, not necessarily to any choices the characters on screen made, although it would apply in that case as well. Wrong Turn is the latest in the ongoing stream of abysmal teen horror films cranked out by Hollywood since the mid-90s or so. The odd thing is that they chose to focus their plot this time around a man studying to be a doctor, as if there's a single solitary person in their target audience who could relate to this person. Anyone who knew anything about medicine would have a field day with the ridiculously exaggerated rednecks in this movie.Okay, so I realize that we live in the times of massive special effects and the wonders of Stan Winston and other things that lead to the Hulk being cartoonishly exaggerated to the point that the highly anticipated Hulk remake is rendered a camp comedy, but it's not hard to see how much better Wrong Turn could have been if only they had made the villains at least the TINIEST bit believable. It was rather disturbing for me to read through some of the reviews and posts on the IMDb and see how many people out there were considering what it would take for someone to be inbred to the point where they would look like the people in this movie. `Are there really people like that?' And other such nonsense. Let me tell you what it would take for people to get like that - about five hours of make-up every morning before shooting.Take a movie like Deliverance. Granted, Wrong Turn never had a chance in the world to even approach the quality of a serious thriller, even one far below the status of Deliverance. But the point is that the suspense in Deliverance FAR surpassed anything that Wrong Turn ever even gets close to, because the mountain men in Deliverance were just a lot of backwards rednecks, they weren't monsters as they were in this movie. Deliverance went for scares through avenues of twisted, demented people, mysterious and dark woods, and the knowledge of impending violence in a mysterious setting. Wrong Turn takes the wrong turn of going for nothing more than the weak gross-outs.
When Chris Finn finds himself in a rush and faced with a tremendous traffic jam, he turns around and decides to pull off and ask a gas station attendant if there's another way. The gas station attendant, by the way, provided some promise for the rest of the film, as he sits in front of rust pile of a gas station drinking Pepto Bismol with his three teeth and staring into the dust. There ARE people like THIS in the world. But here is the point where the movie does take its wrong turn. Finn decides to take a route that he notices on a map on the wall, and as he drives off, we get a close-up of this charming businessman muttering under his breath about the mistake that he was making. Because he's entering the badlands, as Stephen King might say. This is when the thriller halts and the goofy horror begins. The guy might as well have said something like, `That ain't no good ah-dear, cityboy. We MOUN-tain foke. We ain't liven out here by yall's RULES and all.' I sigh resignedly as my eyes glaze over for the rest of the film.What follows is the typical jigsaw puzzle of a modern horror film. Everything works JUST right for two people and completely wrong for everyone else. Finn slows to about 5mph to look at a dead deer on the side of the dirt road that he's decided to take around the traffic, and within the 1/30 of one second between that shot and the next shot, he has sped up to about 50, fast enough to slam into a big SUV parked right in the middle of the road, completely destroying both vehicles. Sigh. Anyway, the remarkably polite owners of the vehicle, obviously aware that cars could come FLYING THROUGH this particular section of this particular dirt road, are out of the car and in the underbrush, pondering the mystery of the spike strip that they just ran over.So there you have it. A lot of people (two couples, one single girl and now, one single guy) are in the middle of the woods with no phone, no idea where they are, and no idea that there are creations of Stan Winston waiting in the woods to devour them. Speaking of which, let's consider those creations, as they can be described in no other way. What you have are a lot of examples of evolution in reverse. Sure, inbreeding can do some serious damage to both the phenotype and the genotype of anyone odd enough to mate with their family, but generations upon generations of such inbreeding would create nothing even remotely like what you see here. But whatever, this is a horror movie and it's all in fun. The reason I point out these monsters is that their cartoonishly exaggerated nepotism (I'm only about 60% sure that's the right word, by the way, but you get the point) prevented the movie from ever generating any real suspense, although there are plenty of scenes that will challenge your ability to finish your popcorn.It's too bad that they screwed these guys up so badly, because while the movie was going to be pretty bad from the outset, it could have at least been suspenseful. At any rate, my favorite of the monsters in this movie was the little guy, I don't know what his name was but he looked like a question mark with skin. That's some serious inbreeding. I won't go into the various forehead slapping scenes (although I'd love to), but I really liked how the movie stops in its tracks long enough to shove the impending romance down our throats, as if there was a split second since all the characters were introduced that we didn't already know it was coming. And when I say the movie stopped in its tracks, I mean it very literally. Finn and Jessie, the obligatory love interest, pause under a WATERFALL long enough for her to forget that there are mutants chasing them and tell him about how she and her boyfriend broke up. This is ham-handed screenwriting at it's best. Or worst. Whichever is dumber.(spoilers) The rest of the movie, like all that which preceded this ludicrous scene, is an exercise in bringing about the very ending that you knew was coming all along the way. I will admit that there were some death scenes in the movie that were pretty creative (I was going to say pretty GOOD, but that's hardly the right word to describe a depiction of a girl getting beheaded against a tree with an axe through her mouth), although such things are hardly enough to carry the entire film, which has little else to carry it.",Wrong Turn

The negative aspect is the bad acting and some of the illogical scenes which as a normal human being is little difficult to digest.Overall a good slasher movie and can be watched once.",Wrong Turn

My old video was worn out i watched it so much!!! This is a great exciting Horror Thriller that is ridiculously entertaining & fun.
Although this is made like an old school 70's or 80's slasher it's actually made way better as it has a nice budget & is lovingly crafted & had the amazing mutant hillbilly fx created by stan Winston so it's truly a BRILLIANT excellently made movie.
I have to say how excellent & affective the opening montage scene is as we have creepy primal music with images of news paper reports of missing people in the woods & medical pics of deformed inbreds & it's all done really creepy & unsettling.
The atmosphere & music is all perfect as well as the dense lonely Forrest setting all works perfectly & the mutant hillbillies look terrifying & brilliant at the same time!!!
Stan Winston is a genius as he has created so many iconic movie monsters such The Predator, Terminator & the Jurassic park dinos as well as loads more so you know if his name is attached as producer & fx well you're gonna get something very special & excellently created & those mutants are just that!!!The cast is excellent & i mean excellent with really great performances that you don't usually get in a slasher Horror flick, Eliza Dushku is excellent as a tough girl & not a screaming useless typical final girl,she is strong & resourceful & smart!!! The other stand out performance is from the excellent but underrated Desmond Harrington who seems to be a genre regular like the B movie stars of the 70's or 80's like Tom Atkins,Robert forster or Christopher George,Desmond brings that average joe blue collar guy to his role he's quiet & strong & serious & makes a great lead hero especially in survival films like this & Exit Speed (2008) check that out IT'S excellent & he's good in Ghost Ship (2002) he has an intense presence & was making a name for himself in this Genre but all of a sudden disappeared & seems to be doing alot of T.V work at the moment but it's a shame because Desmond is a good lead actor & really suits this Genre!!!
This mutant hillbilly film has some fantastic suspenseful set pieces like the ""in the trees scene"" or the hiding in the cabin scene which is very intense & scary.
Also i have to mention how beautiful this movie looks at times with some stunning images/matt paintings of the huge dense Forrest & sun setting behind the huge trees there's some lovely looking scenes.
Wrong Turn feels like alot of perfect elements came together when making this film i mean legendary make up fx designer Stan Winston & his studio created the mutant hillbillies & stan Winston also produced the movie & the production all round is at the highest as an art form as you could get for a little horror slasher film that most studios couldn't care less about but here it's all made with the love of Horror & Horror history & the most excellent production design like the mutants cabin it's designed beautifully & director Rob Schmidt really lovingly crafted his movie with full love for old school 70's & 80's Horror movies!!! A nice budget & a studio fully behind this film helped create something very special & definitely not just another typical slasher.There's plenty of blood & guts splatter throughout this fast paced Horror Thriller that's not on long at all but that adds to the urgency of the situation of the surviving characters & the hunt is on fast & furious!!!Wrong Turn is a BRILLIANT Survival Slasher Horror that's full of suspense & action that is lovingly crafted from the old school mould of Horror a 10/10 exciting Horror & one I've been watching since video & now onto dvd!!! Love it & so rewatchable, Wrong Turn is not just one of my favourite horror movies it's actually one of my favourite movies too.",Wrong Turn

I re-watched the movie a few days back, and I still enjoy it as much as I did when I first saw it.""Wrong Turn"" starts off with a guy named Chris, who is trying to drive to a job interview and is passing through West Virginia. After a chemical spill on the highway, he takes a back-woods dirt road to cut around the chemical spill. Bad mistake. Chris accidentally crashes into a parked car on the road. The kids who own the car are a group of campers who became stranded after they ran over some barbed wire strung across the road. Chris leaves the crash site to find help with the campers Carly, Jessie, and Scott, while Evan and Francine wait back at the car. The group discovers an old run-down cabin in the woods, and before they know it, the inhabitants of the cabin, who happen to be three inbred cannibals, arrive, and begin to chase down the kids as they flee through the woods to save their lives.""Wrong Turn"" has a pretty common premise - teens stranded in the woods, attacked by psychotic killer(s). But while the plot is fairly clichéd, the film is still an excellent throwback to '70s and '80s style horror films. Take some elements from ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"", toss some young adults into an unfortunate situation, and add 3 inbred-cannibals, and you've got a pretty good horror movie.To sum it up, ""Wrong Turn"" is a fun horror movie with some creative sequences, and a fairly common but entertaining story. It does what it's supposed to do, keeping you on the edge of your seat and entertained all the way through, and it does it very well. If you like modern horror films, check this out, it's better than most. 8/10.",Wrong Turn
61,kluseba,All Along the Watchtower,6,27 February 2021,"Wrong Turn is a brutal horror movie that I watched twice with friends back when I was seventeen years old. I have recently been rediscovering this movie during the ongoing pandemic. My verdict is that this is an entertaining movie for genre fans but not the greatest film in the franchise.The story is quite simple. Six young adults get stranded in the wilderness of West Virginia. We follow a couple of pot-smokers, a more childish but romantic couple as well as a smart young woman recently left by her boyfriend and an outsider who was on his way to North Carolina. The group soon realizes that a group of inbred cannibals are chasing them without mercy. Since they have no cellular network, they plan on contacting authorities from a watchtower.On the positive side, the locations look absolutely stunning here and have been chosen with care. The movie includes some scary moments such as when the lead characters are hiding in the cabin of the cannibals. The scenes involving the watchtower are quite intense and certainly the most memorable ones from the entire film. The final scene also leaves a gripping impact.On the negative side, the movie needs some time to get you on the edge of your seat. The opening half hour or so could have been cut by at least ten minutes to make this film even more intense. The characters aren't particularly fleshed out as the pot-smoking couple remains superficial and the romantic couple simply behaves in the silliest way and gets quite annoying. The plot is filled with horror movie tropes and quite predictable.In the end, I would recommend watching Wrong Turn if you crave a brutal horror movie that doesn't overstay its welcome, has no pretention and is easy to follow from start to finish. The movie is best enjoyed with a couple of friends on Halloween or on your own during the pandemic in the comfort of your living room. While many viewers claim that the first film is the best of the franchise, I think that the two immediate successors are both more brutal and more creative. If you like this film, you should certainly like its sequels as well. Those who criticize this movie for being shallow should be aware that a horror movie doesn't need to have much intellectual depth and should rather focus on bleak atmosphere which this franchise does very well in my opinion.",Wrong Turn
62,davispittman,Not terrible,6,27 February 2016,"Wrong Turn certainly isn't a bad movie, it's just plagued by some mistakes. First of all, good lord, the inbred killers in the film are freaky looking, which is a good thing, they really needed to be, and the chanting and banshee like screaming they do is just the icing on the cake. The violence was a bit too graphic for my personal taste, but it wasn't as bad as some others I've seen. The runtime was pretty short, but it fit this movie, any longer and it would've been dragging. The actors did a pretty good job with their roles, I did enjoy that. The action scenes were pretty good and high octane, running, screaming and wondering if the character is gonna make it through alive. I just didn't like how some of the scenes in the middle sorta drug on a bit, that was probably it's biggest flaw. Overall, I give Wrong Turn a 6/10. Oh and they should've left out that very last part in the middle of the credits, didn't care for that.",Wrong Turn

67,aidanratesmovies,What is with the positive reviews? This movie is Garbage,2,15 June 2021,"Yet another generic white-trash slasher flick from the early 2000's- Wrong Turn proves to be nothing short of a Texas Chainsaw rip off- except with slightly more plot and far less style. It's easy to say I did not enjoy watching this movie. I try to keep an open mind on horror films in general, as many can be quite panned for silly reasons, but honestly I think this one deserves far more crap than it receives. The only good thing I can say about this film is that lead actor and Dexter star Desmond Harrington tries his best in his role. His lines can be written horribly and his character quite generic, but he does truly try throughout the film despite his inescapable character flaws- and is easily the best actor in the films entirety. The other actors vary from being the stereotypical horror cast members and characters we always see, to being annoying little turds that truly just got lucky to be in a film at all. So much of this film is just tedious nonsense, that it was honestly quite hard to sit through. The dialogue is repetitive, each scene is one stupid game of cat and mouse after the next, and none of it is interesting. The cinematography is done incredibly poorly, the look of the film as bland as can be, and the story is almost non-existent. None of it is frightening, very very little of it is amusing, and it's honestly a dud all the way through. It may not be the worst horror movie i've seen, but it is up there.My Rating: 2.1/10.",Wrong Turn
68,Reviews_of_the_Dead,Solid and Enjoyable Modern Slasher,7,24 September 2020,"This is a movie that I have a lot of time for. The first time I saw it was due to my sister getting the DVD. We both liked Eliza Dushku from Bring It On. We also knew Jeremy Sisto from Clueless and Kevin Zegers and Lindy Booth from the Dawn of the Dead remake. This was an interesting one on top of the cast for the fact that we have family from West Virginia, where this is supposed to take place and we like horror films. I did give this a watch with a critical eye thanks to the Podcast Under the Stairs for its Summer Challenge Series of the 2000s, giving me a reason to give this a rewatch. To get into this movie, the synopsis is Chris (Desmond Harrington) and a group of five friends are left stranded deep in the middle of the woods after their cars collide. As they venture deeper into the woods, they face an uncertain and bloodcurdling fate.We start this movie off with a young, college couple as they rock climbing. The guy is Rich (Joel Harris) and his girlfriend Halley (Yvonne Gaudry). He is a bit of a jerk and gets to the top first. Something happens to him though. She thinks he's playing a joke or messing with her, but when she calls out we see something has killed him. She has to cut herself free and she falls. There's something in the woods after her.From this point, I do like that we get newspaper headlines about there possible being 'Mountain Men' in the area. The legend goes that they are super strong, inbred and that this might come with mental disabilities that cause madness. They are also hunting the areas around where this couple disappeared. This of course is something I don't believe, but is it out of the realm of possibility in real life? No, especially with the madness and entitlement that comes with living off of the land like these mountain people do.The movie then shifts us over to Chris Flynn in his car. We get the idea that he's in a hurry. The problem is that there's an accident on the highway. He checks with a truck driver, James Downing, just ahead of him. He relays there was a jack-knife accident that caused a chemical spill. Chris gets back in his car and tries to find another way. We learn he needs to get to Raleigh for a job interview. He finds another road and it leads him to a gas station ran by an old man, Wayne Robson. Chris asks about other possible routes and the old man isn't helpful. There is a map that Chris uses and he believes he's found one. He decides to take it.He seems to be making good time, but when he isn't paying attention, he crashes into another vehicle. Thankfully, no one was in the other at the time. The other vehicle belongs to Francine's (Booth) mother though. With her is her boyfriend of Evan (Zegers). There is also Scott (Sisto), Carly (Emmanuelle Chriqui) and Jessie Burlingame (Dushku). As I said, no one is hurt, but they're stranded now. It appears that the other vehicle is stuck after it ran over barbed wire. They at first think someone just left it, but Jessie believes this was a trap. Chris, Jessie, Carly and Scott set off to find help or a phone.Things take a dark turn though as they head out. Evan and Francine are attacked by something in the woods. The other crew finds a cabin in the woods. They aren't the first ones to fall victims to these traps as it becomes a fight for a survival as they try to get back to civilization while these inbred hill people do what they do best, hunt.Now I'll be honest, I know this isn't the best movie, but I have a lot of fun with it. It really isn't a movie that does anything we haven't seen before in other slasher films. We have our crew that get stranded in the middle of the woods which isn't the first time we seen this. I mean Jason Voorhees, although not inbred, is a boy that is mentally handicapped. I wouldn't necessarily say that this crew is handicapped, but as the headlines stated, they're superhuman. I do think it is funny the names given to them of Three Finger (Julian Richings), Saw-Tooth (Garry Robbins) and One-Eye (Ted Clark).Something that really works for me for this slasher film is that I like the characters. We learn that the group of friends is true in caring for Jessie. Her boyfriend broke up with her so she's sad. Carly rounded up all of their friends to help her get her mind off of it. Francine doesn't even really seem to want to be there, the same could be said for Evan, but like I said, they took her mother's vehicle to come out here. I also don't think it is because they don't care for Jessie, camping just isn't their idea of fun. The one that is a bit weak though is Chris. My issue with him is that Harrington is just a bland actor and doesn't add much. I do like the setting though. Being lost in the woods can be scary and having this group hunting them adds to that. They seem to know their surroundings so much better, like the quickest way to get to a certain location and they also have booby traps set up, plus with their physical attributes, it makes it even scarier.Since I leaned into this a bit, I will shift this over to the acting. Dushku is really good. She really likes to go camping from what we learn so I enjoy that we're establishing that part of her character. Chriqui is more of a city girl, but will do whatever she can to cheer up her friend. She does get whiney, but I think we need that. Sisto is a bit of a hippy, Zegers is a douche and Booth is freaky. I just like that even though we don't get a lot of screen time with some of these characters, I know this much about them. It invests enough from me to and I like that for my slashers. Plus, all of the women are nice to look at, so there's an added bonus. The villains are also good. The make-up they have is solid and I was glad to see Stan Winston's name in the credits. Before going too deep there, Richings is one of my favorite character actors from this era for sure.Since I brought up Winston, I really like what they do with most of the effects. I've already said that the look of the hillbillies is good. From everything I could tell, they went practical there. We get some dead bodies that look realistic. The blood does as well. If there is an issue I have is when they get to a watchtower. When they're climbing up, they use green-screen and it was pretty obvious. They use it again soon after that really just didn't work. The cinematography aside from that is fine I would say. It doesn't necessarily stand out, but any issues.Now with that said, I understand that this isn't a great movie. It is a fun slasher, with a bit of a mean spirit without going too far. I like the group of friends and would say the acting is solid overall. I like the look of the killers and the setting really adds an element as well. The practical effects are good thanks to Winston and his crew. My only glaring issue there is the green-screen. Aside from that, it is really more of a popcorn film that I could just throw on and enjoy, knowing it isn't great.My Rating: 6.5 out of 10",Wrong Turn
69,Samiam3,Quite good for its type,7,23 July 2010,"I'm not particularly partial to this category of horror, but I liked Wrong Turn. I cannot say much for its scary factor, but it may give you goosebumps at least. One thing to say about slasher films, they are pretty tough on rednecks or hillbillies. Sure they may not be the most educated of people, but they are not quite as satanic minded as those in Texas Chainsaw Massacre, the Hills Have Eyes, plus all the followers/rip-offs. Wrong Turn does indeed have its roots in Craven and Hooper's work, but the movie has enough going for it to make it feel more entertaining than derivative.Deep in the Appalachian forests of West Virgina, generations of inbreeding have produced what the press refers to as 'mountain men'. They are cannibals, killing anyone who bothers to drive down Bear Mountain road, something that Dr. Chris Flynn is about to find out. (along with the people whose car he accidentally hits)The first item worth noting about Wrong Turn is evident from shot #1. Director Rob Shmitt places value on making his viewer feel like he/she is in the middle of nowhere. Plenty of Aerial photography using the widest lenses possible present the Appalachian forest in away that makes it look as epic as the Congo. Once you are inside, you ain't getting out. Something else worth noting is the nature of the human beings we are meant to be rooting for. I was expecting to see a handful of whiny hapless teens. These characters are slightly more human. This is in part because they are adult, but more because rather than getting freaky from over-acting, they work together to solve problems, and are even given a chance to exchange some fun banter. Now how about those mountain men. I've decided not to come down too hard on Wrong Turn for it's misportrayal of South Eastern (rural society) Americans, because these people are not so. To call them 'people' would actually be charitable, these guys are monsters. Depending on the camera angle and the quantity of make up, They resemble he Orcs from The Lord of the Rings or the Beast People from The Island of Dr. Moreau. All in all, Wrong Turn does its job. I would've liked to have been a bit more scared or on the edge of my seat, but I'd call the film satisfactory.",Wrong Turn

71,aimless-46,You've Seen It All Before But the Scenery Is Nice,5,25 October 2006,"""Wrong Turn"" is a textbook example of how the industry corrupts a genre by running winning formulas into the ground. The process could be described as CGP (computer generated plot). Simply take all the old elements in the familial horror category and string them together with a few lines of dialogue. Although started by ""Psycho"" back in 1960, the genre did not really get going until the original ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"". It combined the weird family stuff with elements from 'Deliverance"" to portray the backwoods American family as demented in- breds who bring their victims to a home they have turned into a slaughterhouse. ""Wrong Turn does not take the self-parody route, everything is played straight-a strange choice considering the obvious absurdities and the many times a viewer must suspend disbelief- knowing that not even a complete idiot would behave the way these characters do throughout the movie. To a casual observer, ""Wrong Turn"" looks pretty good. It should since so little was spent on the screenplay and the cast that almost all of the $10 Million budget was available to buy the services of competent film production professionals. It's the standard inbred familial horror plot, six young adults: Chris (Desmond Harrington of ""The Hole""), Jessie (Eliza Dushku of ""Buffy"", Carly (Emmanuelle Chriqui of nothing you want to see), Scott (Jeremy Sisto of ""May""), Evan (Kevin Zegers of nothing I want to see) and Francine (Lindy Booth of ""Relic Hunter"") find themselves being systematically exterminated by a trio of absurdly deformed characters in the backwoods of West Virginia. There is the obligatory rundown house with bones, jars of gore, and mementos of a legion of past victims; including a parking lot size field of victim vehicles (yet another detail poorly copied from ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre""). There is less misogyny than usual but the same off-kilter moral force that punishes the cast for engaging in sex and mild drug use. Since this has been done in countless other movies of the genre, you don't blame the producers for copying this stuff, you just can't believe that with a $10 million budget they couldn't do it at least as good as in the original. It is not a bad cast. Sisto and Booth are very talented. Dushku and Zegers are capable. Harrington knows his limitations and does not try to exceed them. Chriqui should get into another line of work but at least knows not to look directly at the camera. The interesting thing is that they are almost killed off in order of talent (from most to least). You understand this with Dushku, she is the only one with an significant fan base and the only one who could be expected to draw paying customers to the theatre. Booth's early exit is especially puzzling. Her fragile look and big eyes make her the perfect terrorized victim, nicely complementing the strong and capable character played (here and elsewhere) by Dushku. You would think that the computer that devised the plot would have insisted on a more prominent role for Booth. Movie directors in the horror genre have considerable power because the audience only knows what the director chooses to show them. Otherwise they are just guessing and the director can structure things to take advantage of everyone's understanding of horror genre conventions. There are two possible ways for a competent director to take the audience for a ride during a suspenseful scene. They can set it up so that the audience is lulled into thinking nothing will happen and is then stunned when the violence comes out of nowhere (suddenly going from a comic moment to a violent one means that a viewer will have to cover a greater emotional distance-this is a good technique). Or a scene can be set up where everything (actions, score, motivation) telegraphs that something bad is about to happen, only to have it not occur. Early on in ""Wrong Turn"" there is a good example of this type of stuff. As Chris is driving along he takes his eyes off Bear Creek Road to reach for a CD on the floor. Everything points to trouble but it doesn't happen, then just as the viewer relaxes he smashes into a van parked in the road. This raised my expectations but nothing else like this was attempted until much later when Chris flags down the state policeman. Too bad there wasn't more of this type of stuff. Another nice touch was the juxtaposition of second unit bucolic scenery shots with tension filled action sequences. And the opening sequence with the titles and the old newspaper chippings is very effective and ties in nicely with items the group finds in the house and the field of cars. The most basic complaint is that so little really happens during the 84 minutes of running time. There is a reasonable amount of action but virtually no characterization is attempted (for neither victims nor villains). No attempt is made to develop any three dimensional characters which makes for no character identification or point-of-view consideration. Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.",Wrong Turn
72,raulfaust,Escape artists never die,7,11 August 2015,"Out of the 2000's trash classics, ""Wrong Turn"" was one of the few I haven't seen, so I gave it a chance last weekend. This film, albeit having a cover à la ""Hannibal"", starts a tendency of utilizing gory tribal groups attacking the medium citizen from America, varying from scary moments to hilarious situations and behaviors. Also, it's easy to notice how 2006's ""House of Wax"", ""The Hills Have Eyes"" and others were inspired by this, proving that it was at least relatively original back when released. The acting, at some points, is a little campy, but that doesn't spoil the film's overall joy. Of course it doesn't move away from the old slaughter against youth American people, but sometimes it feels like it's just inevitable being this way; I mean, what can thrill more an audience than making they think they could be in the place of the stars? Wasn't that what made 1999's ""The Blair Witch Project"" so successful?

Scenes are directly ripped off from ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" (finding the abandoned cars belonging to the previous victims in a field etc.), as they stumble around through the house looking through the killers' belongings in a scene similar to the ending of ""Friday the 13th part 2"", this is rarely believable (the tree top scene) but it's still a little bit of fun, and the fact that top heavy Eliza Dushku is here doesn't hurt either.

Yes, there are some things in here that is creative (a tree sequence, for example) yet it has some every bad things in the movie.One are the clichés. You see them again. Characters doing stupid things to get themselves killed! But there's a new thing: The characters are great! They aren't one dimensional! There is even one character in here that may make my top 10 best horror characters (I don't have one, by the way).Comparing this with ""The Hills Have Eyes"", there are things in here that are better and worse. The kills are definitely creative (not as creative as the ones in ""See No Evil"") and cool. There's a lot of blood but I want to go back to the clichés: If these cannibals killed your friends, and you end up in their house where one of them is sleeping, and you have three other friends of yours there, don't sneak out of the house! Kill that ONE cannibal! You have THREE people on your side to help!ANYWAY, there are some things better and worse than a regular horror movie. Still, this movie doesn't provide anything new. The ending is still opened. The gasoline station still looks like a haunted house. But if you're a horror fan, you'll enjoy this. I enjoyed it.",Wrong Turn

78,rivertam26,A modern classic of sweaty palm inducing suspense,9,8 July 2020,"I've loved this movie since I first saw it in theaters. It came out a little after the chainsaw remake and didn't receive a big release or a lot of publicity. Which is sad because it could have been a hit. It was also the last movie Stan Winston would do before passing. It centers on a young man trying to make an interview and a group of friends who have an accident because of a razor wire trap left in the road. Before you know it they are being hunted by three cannibalistic, inbred brothers who are superhuman, brutal, efficient and very hungry. The film is an electrifying combination of action, horror and sweaty palm inducing suspense. Eliza Dushku is always sultry in the lead, hottie is Desmond Harrington makes for a fine hero and Emmanuel Chirqui and Jeremy Sisto are engaging as a young engaged couple. Kevin Zegers and Lindsay Wallace of the dawn remake also star as a horny couple. The movie is directed confidently by Rob Schmidt of crime and punishment in suburbia and has some of the best, most creative kills of the decade. The cinematography is impressive as well both claustrophobic, innovative and sweeping when it comes to capturing the West Virginia wilderness.Budget: $12.6M

80,Maciste_Brother,These trees were made for walking...,2,4 February 2004,"WRONG TURN is a TERRIBLE flick. Really bad. It tries to be this TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE kind of horror film but fails are every lame attempt. There's no story. Cute young people end up stranded in a middle of a forest where deformed inbred killers live. The killers looks ridiculous. They belong more in Ridley Scott's LEGEND than in a backwoods slasher! The characters of the victims are annoying. None of the actors can act, including Eliza Dushku. The characters behave in really stupid ways. When the group ends up in the killers house, it takes them forever to figure out that they shouldn't be there. The film is filled with an amazing amount of clichés. For instance, at the beginning, when we see the two rock climbers. The man is quickly killed off screen but the attack on the woman climber is drawn-out and violent. The film is only that: women attacked in violent ways while the men are killed off screen or killed in not so graphic ways. But the thing that sinks this turkey is the whole scene where we see three of the young folks walk about in those HUGE trees. I never laughed so much. It is, by far, THE MOST LUDICROUS scene ever conceived in the history of cinema. I've never witnessed anything so stupid, and I've seen a lot of bad movies. Do the producers think that audiences are THAT stupid?!?!Anyway, like so many horror films made these days (JEEPERS CREEPERS, DARKNESS FALLS, etc) WRONG TURN is a totally worthless so-called ""horror"" film.",Wrong Turn

To his dismay , highway has been blocked due to some road accident which makes him turn to different mud- ridden road for which he has to go through deep forest area. His day turns worst when he meets another group of people who are trapped in the jungle and slowly gets hacked to death one by one by bunch of man-eating cannibals. Together , must pave their way out of jungle before they get eaten by the merciless cannibals. Directed by Rob Schmidt , Wrong Turn was released in 2003 and had no big names attached to it. However , this turned out to be a surprise slasher movie that will give a chill running down your spine. Right from the beginning of the film till the end , it grabs your attention in every frame. Some scenes do stand out like the one when Chris and Jessie hide themselves underneath the bed and one of the cannibal is trying to find his bullet dropped from the gun. I like the scene where they jump from the tower into tree and camouflage themselves. Direction is good along with good performances. Screenplay is tight. Cinematography is eye grabbing capturing the essence of the mountain area. Performance by the star cast is nice.

The tense music and atompshere of West Virginia give the film a nice little freaky mood. Desomnd Harringtion and Eliza Dushku are both good in the lead roles and don't really go into standrard horror film cliches. The standrard horror film cliche comes in the form of Emmanuelle Chriqui who plays her role very well and I hope to see her in more horror films.

84,IonicBreezeMachine,"What it lacks in originality, it makes up for in intensity and craft",6,30 July 2021,"In West Virginia, Chris Flynn (Desmond Harrington) takes a forgotten back road called Bear Mountain Road in the hopes of making an appointment in Raleigh. When he collides with a vehicle belonging to a group of hikers consisting of Jessie (Eliza Dushku), Carly (Emmanuelle Chriqui), Scott (Jeremy Sisto), Evan (Kevin Zegers), and Francine (Lindy Booth). When they join up to find help they stumble across a trio of inbred, cannibalistic mountain men and are chased across bear mountain and picked off one by one.Released in 2003, Wrong Turn is an internationally produced independent horror film produced by veteran special effects artist Stan Winston. Intended to be a throwback to 70s era backwoods horror films like Deliverance and Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Winston finds himself in familiar territory having previously helmed the underrated supernatural horror Pumpkinhead which was also noted for its backwoods aesthetics. Wrong Turn was noted for its troubled post production with multiple submissions to the MPAA coming back with an NC-17 rating, and the violence in the film was so intense that Fox had trouble simply getting TV spots and trailers approved (which motivated further entries to be released direct to video unrated). Along side Cabin Fever and Saw, Wrong Turn is also credited with helping define the tropes and trappings of the horror genre (for better worse) that would carry on throughout the early to mid '00s. The movie doesn't break new ground in terms of its influences such as The Hills Have Eyes or Texas Chainsaw Massacre, but while made from familiar parts they're put to good use creating a quick but intense thrill ride.The actors are serviceable with good chemistry and a sense of camaraderie that makes them likable enough that we care about them, there's admittedly not much depth to the characters, but as they are there's no one who annoyed me and for the most part their deaths hit with impact when shown. The villains on the other hand are not as interesting, while the makeup effects on the mountain men are well done there's not much character among the group as they can't speak and they holler, grunt, and breathe heavily when they're not chopping down unsuspecting dead meat. While it wasn't necessary to see the trio speak or anything, I wouldn't have minded seeing a bit more of their behavior so they could give an idea as to who and what they are (like the dinner scene from Texas Chainsaw).The movie's true strengths lie in its production design, effects, and trade craft. The mountain men's shack filled with all manner of trophies, artifacts, and paraphernalia is wonderfully grotesque as you can almost feel and smell the rot and decay that makes up their putrid existence. The scenes where our main characters are chased through the woods are intense with varied locations like scores of abandoned vehicles from every era, abandoned watch towers set alight, and even a chase through interconnected trees are creative and lend themselves well to the movie's intense violence and oppressive atmosphere.Wrong Turn doesn't reinvent the wheel with the ""killbilly"" horror subgenre, but with good actors, a good pace, and strong effects work from f/x veteran Stan Winston, the team polishes this well-trodden ground and spatters it with blood and viscera that'll quell the appetite of many enthusiasts of the genre. The movie lacks any memorable characters or exchanges, but as pure thrill ride entertainment, you'd be hard pressed to find better.",Wrong Turn

The concept with the inbred mountain men may sound mildly intriguing at first, but nothing interesting is done with it here. We just have three guys who look and act like orcs running around with axes and preying on travelers who've strayed into the forest backlands of West Virginia. Stuff we've seen loads of times before, and since.The movie opens with some scenes of scientific journals on inbreeding, but the deformed guys in this movie have very little to do with anything you might find in the real world. Instead, we get just another Friday 13th or Texas Chainsaw Massacre, only with no shred of originality.The acting is not too bad; in fact, apart from the overall dull concept, there isn't much to complain about here - except that the expected romantic/sexual tension between Jessie and Chris never materializes (which, in such a stressful situation, I guess is realistic enough, but I'd still very much have liked to see some more character development). That's a bit annoying, actually, but the movie is still watchable, if not particularly exciting.My rating: 3 out of 10. I dunno how the movie's got as high an IMDb rating as 5.8 - that's unusual for a movie of this sort of quality. I guess this genre must have a lot of fans.

87,mentalcritic,Poor man's Texas Chainsaw Massacre,1,6 November 2004,"Recycling ideas has always been the norm in Hollywood. Around the time that the third Godfather film came out, a spate of Mafia flicks was almost literally shot out of Hollywood's behind. So it seems only fitting that in this brief trend of revising old horror films, that something so underwritten it makes the recent Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake look like a masterpiece should be offered.Everything they get right in The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (the original one, that is), they get wrong here. None of the characters have enough dimensions for the viewer to care about. None of the characters even seem to have any writing behind them other than notes about how they affect the plot, assuming they manage to do this much. In fact, much of the film feels like it was, to quote the problem with the latter two Lord Of The Rings films, a big exercise in payoff without setup.A film about a bunch of inbred hicks living in the mountains seemed like a good basis at the time. The problem is that the film seems to believe that being about what appears to be four or five inbred hicks is enough distinction. Adding to the problem is the seeming superhuman quality of said hicks. The antagonists get up again after being ""killed"" so many times that one has to wonder if the makers intended this to be a celebration or a condemnation of inbreeding. You can't have it both ways.Of course, there is also the obligatory scene in which one of the hicks apparently survives. This is after being shot or stabbed or ruthlessly beaten, in addition to being burned, and I can only guess at how much shrapnel an exploding truck within a house would throw around. There is a line between asking an audience to supsend their disbelief, and insulting that audience's intelligence. Wrong Turn not only crosses that line, but effectively throws up on it about halfway into the running time.I gave Wrong Turn a one out of ten. Eliza Dushku must be running out of agents to fire, and the rest of the cast are such a bunch of nobodies that nobody will recognise or remember them. Unless you count the guy who looks like a poor man's Eric Bogosian, but that just sums up the entire film. Poor man's everything.",Wrong Turn

89,CitizenCaine,Wrong Turn...About Face,5,21 August 2003,"The only reason why I went to see this movie was because Eliza Dushku had a lead role in it. I always wonder why a movie like this, described as having 6 teenagers getting lost in the West Virginia mountains pursued by cannibalistic mountain men with mutant looking faces, has actors in it that are obviously not teenagers. The six actors in question range in age from 19 to 28! At least describe them as college kids for crying out loud. I mean how many high school girls have you seen that look like or (walk like) Eliza Dushku? The usual reason for making these type of movies is to showcase newer, good, young acting talent. However, the six actors featured in the movie have acting credits ranging from 5 to 10 years in movies and television, so what's the point? The plot we've seen numerous times before and the obvious influences are here: Deliverance (minus any great instrumental), The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (which I believe is being remade), and The Hills Have Eyes (minus the claustrophobic setting). The most interesting aspect had the young people fleeing to a watchtower.I was able to predict much of the development of the story before it happened, as will anyone else that has seen a fair share of these type of movies. The climax was disappointing as I felt the camera was whirling around too much. The middle section of the movie did maintain a high level of tension though. The acting was passable at best. In a situation like this, you would expect people to be absolutely hysterical, especially at the end. Otherwise, I was waiting for the adrenalin build up where people let it all out and fight back with strength beyond their or our expectations. It never happened. What really bothered me regarding the credibility of the movie was how on earth could these mountain men be right on their heels all the time, especially at night (besides the fact that it was written in the script that way)? It seems to me the mountains in the movie included a very large area. This was after the young people seemed to drive quite a distance away, several miles at least. The mountain men were following on foot yet! Come on! I would have thought that any young person would have been able to out run any of these lumbering mountain men, especially with each of them all carrying various weapons. Oh I forgot, one of the very first glimpses we had of one of the mountain men showed him wearing what looked like a pair of Chuck Taylor Converse All Star tennis shoes.

Better than average...,7,29 November 2005,"As many people, I was expecting some typical slasher of the trend started by ""Scream"", ""I know what you did the last summer"", ""Urban Legend"", among others; but I was pleasantly surprised by how different and surprisingly entertaining it was.Eliza Dushku is the lead in this horror movie that brings back memories of ""The Texas Chain Saw Massacre"" and ""The Hills Have Eyes"" while mixing it with the few best things about MTV generation's slashers. Sure, this may not be very original, but it's quite unusual in these days to see a horror film that really fulfills it's task: to entertain.Desmond Harrington plays Chriss, a man who on a hurry takes an abandoned road across the forest somewhere in West Virginia, U.S.A., has a car accident that destroys not only his car, but also the one of a group of 5 people who were camping. With both vehicles destroyed and no cellphone communication, they try to find help but instead find themselves hunted by a strange group of people who seems to want them dead.Harrington gives a fine performance, as well as the rest of the cast, particularly Jeremy Sisto; but it's Eliza Dushku who has the chance to shine and to join scream queens like Jamie Lee Curtis and Linnea Quigley in the pantheon of mythical horror heroines.The movie is a good change from the toned down PG-13 and this one earns an R rating. It has awesome make-up in the gory scenes, no surprise that Stan Winston produced it. The whole feeling of the movie is that of those old horror flicks of the 70's & 80's, but with modern technology.Director Rob Schmidt does a great job at keeping the suspense, making the film flow at a good pace. The edition is also outstanding and helps to make the uncertainty of the attacks a lot more intense. The audience feels the despair of the victims and the feeling of uncertainty and isolation is well handled.Even when the script may not be Oscar-worthy, it does a good job in developing the characters enough to make us feel for them, and while it does have it's troubles it still manages to be entertaining.Overall, ""Wrong Turn"" is a good film to spent an afternoon, a reminder of how horror films used to be in those long lost days, and a promise of what is still to come in the future for the genre.7/10",Wrong Turn

Wrong turn is basically about how inbreeding makes mentally and physically abnormal people and I must say that it succeeds in being pretty scary, gritty and original despite being set up rather standard in the beginning. The thing that makes this one a failure in the end though, is the fact that the first ending is unbelievable and that the second one (the 'extra ending') after some credits already rolled onto the screen is plain stupid.

The opening sequence was unusual and eerie but somewhat predictable. The acting was very good for actors who in the past few years have started their careers (Emmanuelle Chriqui, Desmond Harrington) and the acting was believable, it wasn't cheesy or pointless. The movie had lots and lots of gore for example: a girl gets barbed wire jammed across her mouth, and is then pulled off the ground. I think enough has been said. This movie is not for the faint of heart or people with raw stomachs. The film's storyline was brilliant: (A story of a group of people stranded in the forest of West Virgina on a dirt road who discover the home of cannibalistic mountain men disfigured from generations of inbreeding. The group of people than become chased through the woods, trying to get away as the men hunt them down in hope of getting another meal.)

McElroy (that's the guy who wrote BALLISTIC: ECKS VS. SEVER, folks) returns with a far, better movie that his most recent attempt at a film. The plot is pretty much recycled, and the ""cannibalistic inbred"" guys are cliched. In fact, WRONG TURN has cliches up the ass, and that's what is good about it. The plot is traditional. And best of all, it is simple. People get in car accident, creepy guys start killing them. Genious!The main goal of horror movies nowadays is to try to do something that people haven't seen before and to try to make them scared for once. WRONG TURN tries to give the people something we haven't seen a million times over. It is very hard nowadays to make a horror film plot without making it so complicated that most audience members won't even be able to follow along. GHOST SHIP was a great film. But, the plot was twisting consistantly and some people couldn't follow. Same with RESIDENT EVIL which was even more complicated.WRONG TURN has a feel to it about the woods. The woods make the film more creepy. This is obviously a feature that THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT inspired. The trees and the forest at night will scare the hell out of you. Yes, it would. But, WRONG TURN doesn't totally complete the feat of scaring people. WRONG TURN had suspense, but it wasn't enough to make you jump when the actual shock came. Maybe once. But, other than that, the film doesn't have the best of pacing.The film even sometimes drags, but not for very long. The cast is very good looking.

Okay ""Wrong Turn"" isn't perfect and not quite up there with the best, but it's still a decent cannibal slasher flick.The plot a group of friends and another guy gets stranded in the middle of the woods, after their tires are slashed with barbed wire, so they start to wonder off looking for help, then they stumble across a cabin where they encounter a family of inbred deformed cannibals who want nothing more but to kill the group of friends and eat them, and then it becomes a tale of survival as they try escape back to civilisation and avoid the deadly traps.Okay the plot is as old as time, but that's what's fun about it, and it's interesting to see what this type of movie would look like if there's a decent budget and well it does certainly pay off, as the cannibal family are armed with bows and arrows and even guns, which does add tension and makes it more nerve racking and this movie does have genuinely terrifying moments, I mean the deformed mutants are actually very creepy and run fast. The scene where the friends stumble across the graveyard of cars is well shot and does make me feel that it will be almost impossible for any of them to survive. There are some very few minor bad points that does stop this from being a true classic, like there are some tense scenes but they do become very predictable, like I knew who was gonna die and in what order and the dialogue is a bit stilted and can become very dull, and the stupidity of these characters at times is just unbelievable and takes away the realism of the situation and this movie due to the decent production values does look way too glossy and over the top at times trying a bit too much to stylish which takes away the true fear and horror. But the gore and deaths look realistic and cool which is always a plus side in my books.The performances are decent in this movie as well apart from the odd stilted dialogue. Elisha Dushku, who I've always loved from her days in Buffy the Vampire Slayer, and give a stand out performance in this movie, she was definitely the most interesting character in this movie really giving it all and playing to her strengths and why she isn't more famous by now. Desmond Harrington gave a more restrained and laid back but nonetheless very solid and very believable when he steps up to the game and becomes the hero and had great chemistry with Elisha. Emmanuelle Chirqui was beautiful and very likable and overall giving a solid performance. Jeremy Sisto was decent playing the funny guy but did at times become grating but he still did great. Lindy Booth was also stunning but wasn't given much to do and bowed out way too early as did Kevin Zegars whose a decent actor but again like the latter wasn't given hardly any screen time making him pretty forgettable. And a special mention to the cast who played the inbred mutants who each gave stand out and credible performances.All in all ""Wrong Turn"" is a decent tribute to the glory days, and I did give a average review previously, but after some time I have appreciated this movie a lot more, okay maybe a bit too stylish and glossy at times, but overall a great gore flick which spawned a semi successful franchise a few years later.",Wrong Turn
99,DonFishies,"Great makeup, but an all around disappointment otherwise",3,15 October 2009,"Despite having a habit of watching the bigger budgeted horror films, I never managed to watch Wrong Turn until recently. I have always been a fan of Eliza Dushku, but for one reason or another, I just kept putting off watching this one. Turns out, I made a wise decision.Chris Flynn (Desmond Harrington) is late for a job interview, and runs into a pileup on a rural highway. Thinking it wise to take the scenic route, he takes the titular wrong turn, looks away from the road and smacks into a vehicle that has just had its tire ripped to shreds by barbwire. Turns out the group of young people, who were away from their car at the time, were on their way to a camping expedition to help bring up the spirits of the recently dumped Jessie (Dushku). As the group sets out to look for help, they soon realize the rumours of ""inbred mountain men"" who kill all travelers is more truthful than they could imagine.Wrong Turn does not set out to be much of a movie, and does not deliver one either. Storywise, the film does not pull any punches and does not try to do anything unique or special. While it does feature a number of gross-out moments and unbelievably ""suspend your imagination"" style moments, it does not give much else. I wanted the film to end right after the predictable opening credit sequence that gives out the few details the film itself does not want to. It just feels so incredibly lazy at most times that I wonder why Fox thought it was a great idea to produce two direct-to-video sequels to it. Do they really think anyone has any care for these heartless inbred killers? Did the film really do well enough to warrant revisitations? Like nearly every single horror film made before or after it, we are given the requisite group of beautiful young people, and then proceed to watch them get killed over 80-minutes. But while some horror films make a genuine attempt at making at least some of their characters likable, the characters here are really not given much to go on outside of very one-dimensional traits. And sadly, it does not appear that any of the actors really give anything to the proceedings either. They just go through the motions of any typical horror film you can pick from a hat: they are either holding their breath to avoid being noticed, screaming, looking terrified, or running. And while the film is a brisk 84-minutes, it feels much longer because of how routine and by-the-numbers this movie feels.But while the lack of acting and character dimensionality can be fun for someone walking into a film featuring Jason, Freddy or Jigsaw (or any number of his ""apprentices"" since the filmmakers refuse to bring him back to life) and waiting for their greatest hits number of grisly murders, the ""mountain men"" killers here have no personality. They have no finesse, and are barely even scary. They just lumber around, occasionally killing people with the likes of arrows and axes, and chase after the young people stupid enough to have gotten caught in their woods. They have zero development, and serve no real purpose outside of taking out the group of characters in the film one by one. I wanted to root for these villains like I would Jason or Freddy, but they never do anything worth cheering about. I could care less about them even more than the hastily written group of travelers.What the ""mountain men"" do succeed at is having some really incredible makeup. The film was produced by the legendary Stan Winston, and it is clear right from the start that the audience is in for a treat with the special effects used to make these characters look the way they do. While they are frequently hard to see in some cases, the glances we do get at them provide for some of the sickest visuals I have seen in awhile. These three villains are simply disgusting by all counts. They did not necessarily make me want to throw up, but they were clearly created to be rather nightmarish. It is easy to tell exactly where all the emphasis and money went into when the film was created back in the early 2000's.As said previously, the acting is not all too incredible. Harrington is supposed to be the lead here; the hero for the entire film. The direction his character goes in, and his actions, all dictate he is the lead and he should be doing the most work. But he is overshadowed entirely by Dushku. She gives her character what little spunk and attitude she can, and makes her independent of the rest of the cast. She delivers the best performance, but only because her tone and attitude is in the right place. Harrington ends up looking confused most of the time, because she actually does something, while he sticks with everyone else giving the same sad performance. But do not take my praise for Dushku for granted; her acting is just as lousy as everyone else. I was hoping for much more with Emmanuelle Chriqui and the ever reliable Jeremy Sisto, but both proved to be just as disappointing as Harrington and Dushku.Wrong Turn is a disappointment all around. It has some incredible makeup effects for the villains, but not much else. It is a by-the-numbers horror flick that gives nothing to the genre, and asks for nothing back. I guess for its time it can be considered incredibly violent, but six years later, it does not even shock in the least. Unless you count all lazy it all is.3/10.(Portions of this review originally appeared on http://www.dvdfanatic.com).",Wrong Turn
100,moviesleuth2,"Gory, brutal fun!",7,19 May 2010,"When I was growing up, I couldn't stand movies with any gore or extreme violence. Without a doubt, ""Wrong Turn"" is a movie that would have completely traumatized me. Now that I'm older, I've grown to like these movies (the good ones, at least), and I can appreciate what they're trying to do: scare the living hell out of anyone who watches them. ""Wrong Turn"" is no classic, but it delivers the goods!Chris Flynn (Desmond Harrington) is a young doctor on his way to an interview, and he's already running late when a traffic jam will leave him backed up for another few hours. He takes a shortcut and ends up crashing into a car filled with five would-be campers who are sidelined with a flat tire. But when they go looking for a phone, they realize that they're not alone.This is a fun horror movie. It delivers the classic shocks and scares, but it doesn't forget that this is all supposed to be entertaining. There are no jokes or one-liners, but it's also a fun ride. However, it lacks an edge to really push it over the edge. In some ways, it feels like director Rob Schmidt is holding back, and that's a shame. The whole movie feels like it's a little lacking.Maybe part of the reason is that the acting ranges from okay to (in one case) awful. Desmond Harrington is always so serious, but that's more because of how the character is written. Harrington is a pretty decent actor (he gave a good performance in ""Ghost Ship""), and any time he's allowed to display his range, he jumps at the chance; sadly, those moments are few and far between. Likewise, Eliza Dushku is solid as Jessie, but she really isn't given many lines, so it would be rather unfair to grade her performance. Jeremy Sisto gives the best performance in the film as the talkative Scott, but unfortunately he's paired with Emmanuelle Chriqui, who is so irritating that I kept praying that someone would push her out of the car whenever the crew is trying to escape the murderous hillbillies. Lindy Booth and Kevin Zegers are also okay, but not that great.Or possibly the reason why the movie lacks an edge is that there's nothing really unique about the villains. Sure, they're violent murderers and they look like something the cat coughed up, but really, they just seem like three psychos with weird skin (credited to Stan Winston, who also produced the film, but his make up is the worst he's ever done). In the trailer, the hillbillies look monstrous, and inhuman. The film makes them just plain ordinary.One thing the film does have is an amazing soundtrack. The score, credited to Elia Cmiral, is just creepy, and it's guaranteed to get your adrenaline pumping. Cmiral's work saves a lot of the movie's potential scares by setting us on edge.Overall, the film isn't perfect and not especially memorable, but it gets the job done okay.",Wrong Turn

He isn't ever going to get there but that's not important. It's the fact that he took a short cut. And was drink driving. (Yes, I saw the beer he was chugging from in his hand. Not many people notice that). Then crashes into a Range rover because he isn't looking where he's driving. How can a cd be so important that you have to keep driving while you aren't even looking.I'd rather he died right there. He deserved it.Then we meet the people he hit.

Director Schmidt makes the most of the wilderness settings and creates some great moments of action and thrills. The makeup FX are chillingly well-done too!The cast is pretty strong. Desmond Harrington makes for a good leading man/victim. Eliza Dushku does a solid performance as her role of a fellow victim.

Wrong Turn turned out to be a really good movie. It's a refreshing Slasher film that does things slightly differently.The kids get into a car accident that turns out to be a trap set by psychopathic killers. The accident happens early in the movie before we learn much about the characters. The action begins quickly, and I do mean action, as the group of slashers hunt down these kids, who wanted to get out of the woods more badly than any group of young attractive kids ever did, like animals. Eliza Dushku earned her place on the poster. She's not playing a victim at all as she tries to lead her friends out of the woods.

Most of the sequels are bad, cheap and vulgar movies, but also fun, and just... why not. I knew I was going to re-watch the entire franchise when the first news about the 7th installment came out, now known more as a reboot, coming from Alan B. McElroy, the writer of this, the very first part. Seeing as the new trailer came out recently, it's time to start.. To whom its obvious and to whom not, but this is the best film in the franchise. So far.Chris Flynn (Desmond Harrington) is running late for an interview in another city, so he takes the wrong turn... Where he crashes into a car of five unlucky teenagers, featuring the careless horny couple of Evan (Kevin Zegers) and Francine (Lindy Booth), the cute pair of Carly (Emmanuelle Chriqui) and funny man Scott (Jeremy Sisto), and last, but not least, scream queen Jessie, portrayed by Eliza Dushku. Guys have already fallen prey to the inhabitants of the woods, they just don't know it yet... ""Wrong Turn"" is what comes out of the blender, if you mash ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"", ""Friday the 13th"" and ""Deliverance"" in it. A run-down-the-mill backwoods slasher, offering enough cat-and-mouse, gore and ax-wielding kind of jolts. A slasher better than most, but not good enough to often make it into any tops.""Wrong Turn"" also does the good job of not displaying much of comedy, but rather continuously gets down to the brass tacks, like, say, the later ""The Hills Have Eyes"" remake - it had, in my opinion, overall more compelling characters and more effective melodrama, and nastier gore... Anyways, my point is, ""Wrong Turn"" takes itself seriously, and I like that. One-Eye (Ted Clark), Saw-Tooth (Garry Robbins) and the one guy enduring through the franchise - Julian Richings's Three Finger, are the three simplistically awesome villains of ""Wrong Turn"", and what's worse than one maniac chasing You? Three! Or, in the next sequel, the whole family... Visually, ""Wrong Turn"" still feels like a rather high-class slasher, the cinematography's good and solid (and also like it's 2002), action sequences are decent, the good-looking locations are taken advantage of, and FX & gore is going to make any horror fan excited.A straight-forward horror in the best slasher traditions that made it to the hearts of horror fans, then spawned six sequels, each more perverted and shlocky than the previous, and is now being ""fixed"". If you feel like re-watching the whole franchise is not worth it, I assure you, there are a couple good reasons to at least re-visit this first one before receiving the new. My rating: 6/10.",Wrong Turn
111,Danny_G13,Occasion where trailer is vastly inferior to the movie,7,16 April 2005,"Survival horror manages to entertain on just about every level, while also succeeding in creating genuine tension.Having seen the trailer for Wrong Turn some time ago, I was grossly put off the film. The trailer portrayed a dull teen slasher with little imagination, and derivative of just about everything else out there. Safe to say I wasn't inspired to view it. However, after a friend advised that the trailer nowhere near does the full film justice, I thought I'd give it a whirl.The story here is that after generations of inbreeding (Quite why, no one knows), 3 deformed forestfolk have essentially become cannibals and feed by stopping passing cars via planting barbed wire on the road.Much like The Texas Chainsaw Massacre they kill not for killing's sake, but to feed - it's how they survive.However, Wrong Turn takes echoes from Deliverance when a group of teens get stranded via afforementioned method, and find themselves struggling to stay alive after stumbling on the cannibals' den and mistakenly alerting them to their presence.Eliza Dushku and Desmond Harrington star as Jessie and Chris, initial strangers brought together by the nightmare they end up in. Jessie's in a party of 5 including herself, and Chris was on his way to a job interview. After smashing into their stranded car, Chris joins the group searching for a working phone.Needless to say, much slicing and dicing occurs before this one is over.A surprisingly decent job was done with this movie. Sure, it's not going to win any awards for originality, the script's hardly inspired, and the acting is hardly Oscar level, but what it does it does fairly well.The direction in particular is quite excellent. It's fast paced, it's thrilling, and it's extremely smooth. Arguably there's a bit of a missed opportunity with the cinematography as there are chances for epic panoramas which are never taken properly, but aside from this the movie's technically sound.Another major bonus is the surprisingly effective tension created, particularly in the killers' den. Without spoiling anything, they make good villains, and their pursuit of the group works pretty well.Certainly it requires a major suspension of disbelief at many moments, and in fact comes across as downright silly at others, but nevertheless it still entertains, which is what it's supposed to do.The plot's not exactly got a lot going for it, but it doesn't really need to. It's a simple survival horror story which relies on style over substance but succeeds in this not being to its detriment.Decent.",Wrong Turn
112,Bloodwank,"Solid, slickly engaging backwoods horror fun",7,9 October 2011,"I used to disdain Wrong Turn as a hollow derivative of The Hills Have Eyes and for some time actually preferred the sequel, until checking it out again recently and rather changing my tune. It is still derivative of The Hills Have Eyes to an extent, Wrong Turn being among the earliest of the newer rash of inbred cannibal against resourceful prey films and The Hills Have Eyes being if not the earliest then certainly the first definitive entry in the genre. But the two differ crucially, the earlier film comes from a critical eye, a director who has watched society and sentenced it, while Wrong Turn is simply a fun horror film. And its a whole lot of fun, with some rather wonderful traits that do not seem to often appear among later films in the genre or even mainstream horror in general. The key to it all comes in the very first scene as scaling a rock face becomes a terse nightmare for a couple of cannon fodder youths. The girl falls enough to incur broken ribs and likely unconsciousness, maybe even broken legs and back but still manages to get up and keep moving. The entertaining fusion of tension and silliness seen here informs the rest of the film and it really works, especially since things never aim for truly gruelling nastiness, just engagement and fear. Thus the car crash that brings the protagonists together yields less angry recrimination than instead cooperation and good vibes and in the films barmiest moment characters perform feats similar to that which nearly killed Jackie Chan on Armour of God, one of them even with a gunshot wound to the leg. And the inbred villains of the piece can wield a bow and arrow like Robin Hood, as well as climbing trees like the most fearless of gymnasts. Its all thoroughly silly but great fun at the same time, and it never really jars with the more frightening moments (there's one real winner of a suspense sequence here), unlike say The Hills Have Eyes '06 with its ill fitted marriage of brutality and cheesy action. The gore here is almost well judged as the silliness, there isn't a whole lot of grue but whats there is mostly short, sharp and effectively savage without any appearance of trying to make the audience sick with realism. A smidgen more would definitely have been beneficial though, particularly when the villains are buying the farm. Acting is generally reasonable, a stone faced Desmond Harrington bears little charisma, but Emmanuelle Chriqui emotes to good effect, Kevin Zegers and Lindy Booth make for amusing stoners and in the best written part Jeremy Sisto has chilled out but ultimately heroic ball. And Eliza Dushku delivers mondo hotness which is a big plus. The handiest thing about the characters though is that they are all written sympathetic rather than obnoxious and self absorbed or resolutely vapid, there's a sense that the writer cares about them rather than just treating them as cannon fodder and it makes for a much more involving experience. I'm not sure I have any serious complaints about the whole film actually, it really rubbed me the right way. Actually I have one, it needed nudity. In a fun trashy horror film, nudity is virtually an essential and there ain't none here. Still righteous stuff though, strong 7/10 from me.",Wrong Turn

It really misses the mark in comparison with Friday the 13th and Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Both had a reason for portraying the characters and the monsters the way it did. They were great stories. ""Wrong Turn"" - although it does have some splendid scenes, it doesn´t really make sense. There´s absolutely no explanation to the behaviour of the ""Mountain Men"" - other than the vague notion of ""in-breeding"". In both Friday the 13th and Texas Chainsaw we have great stories behind the victimization. Why should the mountain men be so vicious and hungry for human flesh? They seem to have no emotions at all - other than an animality worse than ""Jaws"". Moreover, the reactions from the human characters are not very interesting or credible. One could have hoped for another great movie in the league of ""Friday"" and ""Texas"" but again we must see ourselves ""exploited"" by slasher horror imitating the classics.

116,ExpendableMan,One of the better of the recent horror films,7,19 March 2006,"Given the recent disappointment of Andre Aja's The Hills Have Eyes remake, now is as good a time as any to revisit Wrong Turn which told largely the same story three years previously but did it in a far superior way. As mainstream horror looks more to the bludgeoning 70's classics for inspiration, favouring graphic violence over knowing pop culture references it's easy to forget that this movie was one of the first to do so but overlooking it would be a mistake.For while pick axes to the head and mass facial trauma have become commonplace now, back in 2003 it was a breath of fresh air to see a troupe of very attractive young actors being massacred horrifically with machetes and barb wire. And unlike the aforementioned Wes Craven remake this film had the good sense to make the characters likable before unleashing hell. Sure, Desmond Harrington is little more than a hired chin, but Eliza Dushku is a far more endearing character. She isn't a damsel in distress but she's not exactly an independent ass-kicking hard chick either and has a touch of frailty behind her stubborn survivalist determination. Jeremy Sisto also is given lots of cool lines but unlike most wise cracking horror film actors, he's more willing to put himself on the line and his vocal outbursts are borne more of intelligence than vehemence. Come to think of it, his character is nigh on the voice of reason in what is otherwise a very stupid film; ""May I remind you of a little movie called Deliverance?"" But let's face it, character driven emotional studies aren't exactly what you want with a horror film and the effects team (led by the legendary Stan Winston) certainly don't hold back on the gore. The body count may be low compared to other genre staples but the manner in which our heroes meet their makers is gritty enough to stick in the minds. Plus they're usually the end release of a massive build up of tension, a move that makes them considerably shocking than simply having the inbreds wade in with weapons flailing and blood spraying in terrific arcs for ninety minutes. After all, a few shocking deaths are way more effective than lots of mindless ones with no pre-crafted sense of foreboding.Admittedly, it's not perfect. The usual clichés abound in the shape of gas station attendants who neglect to warn them of the danger in the woods for no discernible reason and as soon as you meet the characters, you can tell who's going to die and in what order almost straight away. Nevertheless Wrong Turn is still an enjoyable romp that delivers plenty of gruesome nastiness but doesn't forget to provide ample finger-nail chewing fodder as well.",Wrong Turn

I really wish I would have this film on Blu-ray, but sadly I don't have it, because it was never on my mind. Because over the years I watched the sequels they were so bad awfull that I stayed away from this franchise. I have not seen Part VI: The Last Resort cause Part 3, 4 and 5 were so god awful specially 4 that I couldn't eat anymore, it was so grussome. I hate the sequels. Wrong Turn the original should be a stand up alone movie not a franchise. There was no need for making a sequels.I love this movie to death!!!! I love Eliza Dushku as Jesse Burlingame the main heroine and I love Desmond Harrington as Chris Flynn a bad ass hero. A remake come out this year and I will watch it soon. As for the movie it has no sex or nudity it is like ""Friday the 13th"" and ""Halloween"" boom of the slashers. I love the songs used in this film: Halloween by Dream Syndicate, You Can't Quit Me Baby by Queens of the Stone Age and Wish I May by Breaking Benjamin great songs.The story talks about Chris Flynn (Desmond Harrington) driving cross country road in West Virgina on his way to a job interview. There is a chemical spill on the road, so being short on time, he decides to take a different route, an abandoned dirt road in the middle of nowhere. Unawhere he makes a wrong turn and accidently hits a car from 5 friends on a camping trip. Now they are all stranded in the road in the forrest in the middle of nowhere. So now group of friends all split. A couple stay back by their car while Chris and other 3 friends are going out on a tour to the road for help. Not knowing someone put a trap on them. Now Chris and his new friends become the target from a trio of cannibalistic mountain men horribly disfigured from years of in-breeding. They are the hunters and Chris and his friends are the prey and they are being hunted down one by one. It reminds me on an 80's slasher films like ""Just Before Dawn"" and ""The Final Terror"". This movie should be consider it a classic.Great slasher and great story and great practical effects. A trooper get's an arrow in the head. One of the friends get's three arrows in the back while running away. There is a tree climbing which I love that. One of the cannibals get's hit by a branch in the head. Climatic finale in a cabin is a bad ass. I love the running chases trough the woods. Jesse is been tied with ropes by cannibals and Chris goes like bad ass he is in a rescue mission. He sets the cabin on fire. Drives a police truck trough the cabin in to a ""One-Eye"" fights him off and stabs him my absolutely favorite scene. Saves Jesse when she has a dog leash in her mouth. Jessie shoots ""Saw-Tooth"" in the back with an arrow another my favorite scene. Eliza Dushku with bow and arrow is much better shooter than Sheri Moon Zombie ""3 From Hell"" I hate that movie and I hate Sheri Moon Zombie she is a god awful actress!Eliza Dushku's best performance she is an awesome heroine as Jesse Burlingame she was in Bring It On, Buffy the Vampire Slayer as Faith and Angel and in Tru Calling I miss the actress. Desmond Harrington is great as Chris his best performance. Julian Richings, Garry Robbins and Ted Clark are great as three cannibal hunter killers.

On a light note, it makes horror really fun and pretty much family-friendly. (There is no more blood in this movie than Lord of the Rings.) On a more harsh note, it's also the reason so many people think horror is a unintelligent cheese genre when what we need is more true horror, punk-gore, original works over another movie that takes The Hills Have Eyes and makes it cute and trite.I guess this is the sort of movie that you could watch with some friends and smile at the kills. If you're looking for anything deeper than that, look elsewhere. For a more original and mature movie that follows this fun formula without stepping into the cute territory, check out Wolf Creek.I understand the well-scored reviews. They're right. But DO NOT expect a gory mature movie like I did. It's best just to wait for this to play on TV around Halloween and watch it with your kids. I simply didn't get the same good feeling from watching this, and I see no reason for it to have been made in the first place.",Wrong Turn

Desmond Harrington and Eliza Dushku are solid as the two leads. Emmanuelle Chriqui and Jeremy Sisto are effective as the supporting characters but they both lack screen time since they're written out rather quickly. Lindy Booth and Kevin Zegers are okay in their brief appearances but (like Chriqui and Sisto)their roles are cut to soon for you to care about them. The action which usually involves the mutated cannibals killing the characters in gruesome ways are well executed and somewhat realistic except for a couple of moments. There is some suspense that doesn't quite pay off but it's not a total disaster either. The mutant cannibals look terrifying and are solid villains who lurk in the wilderness preying on those who dare enter their domain. The opening credits showing newspaper clippings of people going missing was effective which sets the tone of the film before introducing the audience to the main characters who find themselves in a desperate fight for survival. The movie could've developed some of the characters more while amping up the suspense and scares which would've made it better. The trim running time of 84 minutes makes the film feel a little rushed but the good outweighs the bad in this one. Overall Wrong Turn is an effective horror thriller with bloody deaths, some suspense, scary villains, a little humor, and good performances by the cast which is sure to please almost any fan of the genre.",Wrong Turn

125,SyoKennex,One of the better survival horrors of the genre,8,11 October 2017,"Wrong Turn is a film that was released back in 2003, is a survival gore horror film. Spanning on to 6 films, and considered a classic in the survival horror genre, I decided to finally settle down and have a look at what the fuss was about.I was utterly surprised by how well done this film was. There were two things that really struck me as well done; the first being the strong female character of Jessie. Eliza Dushku is absolutely amazing in this film, and I don't think I've ever been as struck with awe as I have watching her character get stronger and stronger as she goes on throughout the film. Her performance was absolutely stunning. She's definitely an actress I enjoyed seeing on screen, and I will definitely be looking at more of her films in the future.The second thing I really enjoyed from this film, was the fact that although it was the overdone trope of inbred hillbillies, but the make up for them was done quite well. It showed them as human, twisted and evil, but human, and that's something not often done in the trope. The special effects of the film were really well done, and enjoyable to watch and view as a make up artist; there were one or two flaws with the effects on the face – sometimes the characters would turn and the nose or mouth would obviously be on show, but for untrained eyes, I don't think this would be too much of a problem. Also, the CGI was good, when it was used and this is probably because it was so long ago in 2003, but I feel like it wasn't done well enough. Where it was used, it was obviously very fake – but again, that's probably just because it was 2003. Back then on release, I can imagine that it wasn't so obvious and a lot of people would have found it amazing and awe striking.The plot line was rather generic, and the usual, someone gets killed off as we go along, don't get attached to any of the characters, nearly everyone is going to die in some way or the other. Although, I did find that the meeting between the main characters at the start of the film was rather unique. I personally haven't seen that at all within survival horror and I think it was a good little plot point that I know I enjoyed.It's also refreshing to see that some of the characters – namely Jessie and Chris. Finally, a survival horror film where the characters don't do the generic, I'm going to fall when running and become victim to this mass murderer. It's so incredibly refreshing that I just cannot explain it. It's wonderful to see a film – that is so well renowned in the horror genre and horror community – not follow the terrible generic tropes of its time, and of horror films in general. It's been a long time since I came across a film like this.I don't think I'll understand why this has such a bad review from critics. Of course, not every critic that watches this is going to be a horror film fan, but this has a lot of merit that most survival horror does not. Maybe it's wishful thinking on my part, and my inability to see most flaws in a film unless they completely ruin it, but this was one of the better films of the genre, in my personal opinion. I would definitely watch this film more than twice, and would definitely recommend this to people new to horror, survival horror, or are just looking for a good thriller to watch.I immensely enjoyed this, and it deserves a lot more credit than it's been given.",Wrong Turn
126,happyendingrocks,"I beg to differ with the title... There's not a whole lot ""Wrong"" here",8,14 April 2011,"Wrong Turn is excellent proof that you don't need to re-imagine (or as I call it, ""ruin"") a classic movie to mine horror's archives for inspiration. Originality may not be this film's strong suit, but when a movie packs in as many good scares and gleefully gory bits into its lean 84-minute running time as Wrong Turn does, it's hard not to conclude that it's okay to reference the past, as long as you make good use of what you borrow.The plot unabashedly relies on the formula laid out in Texas Chainsaw Massacre decades ago, and it would be impossible to watch Wrong Turn without drawing parallels between the backwoods cannibal tribe here and the denizens of that fabled Texas farm house. While this should work against the film, the familiarity here plays out more like an homage, and this tribute is all the more effective for it, especially since Wrong Turn is light years better than any of the dreadful Chainsaw sequels and the ill-advised 21st century remake.The excellent cast helps immeasurably in making this film a memorable experience. Desmond Harrington, Eliza Dushku, and Jeremy Sisto all give great performances, and are among the most likable group of prey you'll find in a slasher film. While some might argue that it doesn't matter if you like the intended victims, since their main purpose in the film is to be slaughtered for our amusement, savvy film-makers have learned that if we actually CARE about what happens to the characters, the suspense and pure horror elements are amped up considerably. Our three leads make largely intelligent choices throughout the course of the film, and as a result the ""gotcha"" moments aren't diluted by telegraphed and cliché-ridden set-ups that serve only to pad the running time between splatter set-pieces. Seeing a heroine as strong and resourceful as Dushku's Jessie is a rarity in horror films, and the movie is unfortunately notable for rarely reducing our main protagonists to braying stereotypes. I couldn't mention Emmanuelle Chriqui's Carly in that last paragraph because she almost single-handedly negates all of the positive attributes showcased by the rest of the characters. Carly falls squarely into the prototypical hysterical mode that far too many female characters are required to adopt in horror films, and her histrionics and repeated displays of stupidity make her such an obvious victim that we can't wait for the cannibals to chop her up and get it over with so that we can dispense with the annoying and contradictory air of helplessness and incompetence she brings to the affair.The murderous band of deformed predators are well-crafted villains who are indelibly gruesome thanks to the excellent makeup work of Stan Winston Studios, yet human enough to add a layer of realism that makes the scenario all the more horrifying, since it never seems out of the realm of possibility that there could be a family just like this tucked away in the barren wilds of West Virginia. Their grisly handiwork is shown frequently and graphically, and fans who like a liberal dose of gore will not be disappointed by the ample displays of it here.The film almost goes off track early on when our primary foursome first wanders into the cannibal clan's dilapidated house. The discerning viewer will have to suspend their disbelief pretty heartily to accept how long the group continues to explore the house, despite stumbling across several grotesque curios that would be more than ample to cause any rational person to flee from the scene immediately. Of course, the tense and ghoulish sequence that follows is one of the most chilling in the film, and from that point on Wrong Turn becomes a relentless barrage of horror, so we end up quickly forgiving that momentary lapse of sensibility.I was a bit disappointed with the film's final frames, which blatantly set Wrong Turn up as a mere launching pad for a franchise. The film-makers wisely dangle enough plot threads along the way to suggest that the deeds of our savage killers could be further explored through subsequent outings, but the last scene seems to force the issue, and the only thing missing from the denouement is an end title card that reads, ""Sequel Coming Soon!"". That being said, there are enough great elements here to interest me in seeing more, and while I have not yet pursued any of the follow-ups, I definitely intend to.Though nowhere near as classic or chilling as the Massacre that spawned it, Wrong Turn is regardless an excellent and exciting horror film with plenty of fantastic ideas and the smarts to adeptly pull them off. Despite its flaws, this one delivers the goods at almost every turn, and genre fans who have been largely disheartened by the state of modern horror will find a real gem here.",Wrong Turn

Two people stay at the car, and another group goes for help, only to find a sinister cabin nestled in the West Virgina woods, that is home to a trio of cannibalistic mountain men horribly disfigured from years of in-breeding. They then make a mad dash for their lives through out the woods, only hoping to make it out alive. But, will the trio let them leave their hunting grounds? This is one of those films which are as cliché as you can get and the plot is predictable all the way through. But still, I did like 'Wrong Turn'. It had more than just the classic kids get lost in the woods and get killed. There was a little spark to it and I loved the fact that the killers were deformed mutated humans who were more closer to real monsters, than the more routine big bad guys. One thing I hated is the fact that the actors are so beautiful and glossed over even when they come out of burning towers, running through the wild and their throats are parched without water.

130,kingofdanerds,Pretty much a run of the mill cannibal slasher film,5,15 June 2021,"When one thinks of cannibal slasher films, chances are you would think of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre as a prime example seeing that it birthed the subgenre. Many films have been released as part of this subgenre and possibly the biggest film series that is associated with the subgenre is the Wrong Turn series. The first film, Wrong Turn, was released in 2003 and was a mild enough of a success to pretty much spawn a whole series of films. Wrong Turn was directed by Rob Schmidt and has a very recognizable cast which includes Eliza Dushku (Buffy the Vampire Slayer), Desmond Harrington, Jeremy Sisto, and Kevin Zegers. Something else that I should note is that special effects legend, Stan Winston, not only works on special effects for this film, but also produced this film as well.Chris Flynn is a good old city boy who is on his way to an important meeting. But, traffic blocks his path and so he must find another way. Once doing so, he meets up with a group of young adults and they are all getting picked off by the inhabitants of the Appalachian Mountains.Wrong Turn is just a fairly mediocre film. It does not appear to be better than any of the films that it takes inspiration from. What we get is a film that does give enough to remain interesting, but only to be ""just enough"". Wrong Turn, while not outright scary, does have this eeriness to it. The setting of the mountains really help. We have not quite seen a film that takes place in the mountains and to have a group of people stuck in a fairly remote area is eerie enough. There are some scenes that do help build suspense where it is mostly needed. The three killers in this film are memorable enough but at times come off as silly but also come off as threatening. Plus, the makeup work used on them is really good. The effects overall are fairly good. The practical effects are good and the CGI is not overused. For people looking for lots of gore, this film gives just enough to suffice. I can probably go out on a limb and just say that this is probably the least goriest film in the original Wrong Turn series. The characters are nothing special. They are bland or the regular stereotypes that are usually present in films of this nature. The performances are not the greatest but people like Jeremy Sisto do make it tolerable. What is interesting is seeing who is all in this film (of whom I stated above). One will notice that this film's running time is 84 minutes which is fairly short. The film's pace is fairly nice and does not slow down one bit. It just gets to what people want most with this film.Wrong Turn is pretty run of the mill here. It gives what people want and it delivers but does nothing new with the subgenre to really be memorable enough.",Wrong Turn

I don't even know any of these actors and I must say they did a great job.I think the design on the Mountain Men where great. They where enjoyable to watch in action as we saw then hacking, shooting and cross bowing their way to try and catch every victim. The Mountain Men also blend in really well with the trees and the rest of the forest like environment, and the characters themselves are just savage monsters. I also think the director did a good job with hiding them throughout the film, only showing quick glimpses of the demented, psychotic bastards. I liked two of them in particular.Overall, this is an excellent Horror Flick which digs out the goods by all means of suspense, frightfulness & scares. Watching Wrong Turn is like going back to the 70's.

138,jrfranklin01,It's Got The Gore,5,25 March 2005,"If you want to see some disgusting scenes involving a bunch of mutated redneck siblings, then this one's for you. ""Wrong Turn"" is the story of six youths that end up stuck out in the wilderness after a car accident. What they don't realize is that they just been stranded in an area renowned for missing persons and a group of mysterious and cannibalistic ""mountain men"".The first thing that might cross your mind is what in the world are they doing in the woods down some dirt road, without a map and any clue in general? Likewise the fact that people are actually choosing outdoor recreation where countless others have turned up missing, presumably dead. I guess you could just blame it on poor local law enforcement. Yeah, right. One scene in particular (the car graveyard) will definitely make you wonder how anyone in this day and age could get away with killing so many people. Now I know that a story involving a bunch of disfigured cannibals sounds outrageous, but for those who can't help to look for some sense in what they see, you're going to have to let it go with this one.As to the gore factor, it's pretty high up there. A few scenes in particular are apt to disgust and shock. But then again, that's probably you're motivation for watching this in the first place. The cast is a list of small stars (Elisha Dushku, Jeremy Sisto, Desmond Harrington) who fit their roles quite well.

There is nothing motivating them other than animal instincts. They did not even keep the victims alive for molesting purposes. There is nothing scary about animals molesting dead people.

That was a very good scene.

Sure it's somewhat a cliche fest but if your gonna do it, do it right and this film does.  It's just your basic backwoods horror premise with homages to Texas Chainsaw Massacre, The hills have eyes, Mother's day and etc. Teens get stranded after a surprising car accident and are hunted by inbred mutant cannibals. thats basically it and whoa is it intense and edge of your seat. this film is completely unrelenting and never lets up. The acting is fare and the death scenes are among some of the goriest and imaginative ever created for the silver screen.  So if you don't like that kind of stuff stay very far away. I only wish Fox would've backed up this hackfest and given it the distrubution it deserved. I dragged 7 people with me to see it who had never heard of it.

142,gtc83,"Pretty enjoyable movie, but it could have been so much more",7,25 September 2006,"Some kids get stranded in the woods and are stalked by a group of inbred cannibals. It took a while for the movie to get going, as it starts out with an overly long sequence where the male lead gets stuck in a traffic jam and tries to take an alternate route through the back roads, but once it gets going it provides a lot of action for the remainder of the film. There are a pretty good variety of stalking sequences and some pretty disgusting gore. I thought they made good use of the beautiful mountain scenery. The only real problem with this film is that the characters didn't have much of any character. Eliza Dushku especially makes it through the entire movie without displaying even a hint of personality. By the end of the film, I had no idea if she was a basically nice person or a complete b****. What a waste. The male lead isn't much better, being as generic a good guy as you can get. Actually the secondary characters are much better developed than the primary ones, even though a couple of them are pretty darned annoying, but at least you felt like they were real people. Even the inbred cannibals aren't nearly as well developed or disturbing as those in that memorable episode of the X-Files, and that was just a TV show.There were a variety of things in this movie that made me chuckle and really took away from its believability. When the kids find the cannibals' decrepit shack in the woods, one of the girls insists that she needs to use the bathroom. Come on, no one in their right mind would want to use the bathroom in this place. Or when they are climbing around in the trees trying to escape the cannibals. It was quite an original and exciting sequence, but again, it wasn't believable because you can't just go walking over limbs from tree to tree high up in the forest canopy. They're not laid out like a scaffolding or something. I also got a kick out of how stupid our college kids were in comparison to their inbred foes. At one point they wanted to steal the cannibal's truck, so they come up with this ridiculous plan for one of them to distract them while the others get the truck. Of course, it's pretty obvious they could have all just snuck through the woods instead. At another point in the film, they climb into a ranger tower and proceed to light a couple of light sticks. Of course, it's just getting dark and this light is visible through the window of the tower, shining like a beacon to any man-eating mountain man within five miles.It may sound like I'm criticizing this a lot, but overall it was quite an exciting movie with plenty of action and scares. It's only too bad the lead characters were so undeveloped. If they were real, likable people, the whole thing would have had much more dramatic impact.",Wrong Turn

It has plenty of action and if your a fan of such movies as Deliverance, Southern comfort and Hunter's blood, then you will certainly enjoy this. If you expect to see a great film with a great plot then don't watch this, but if your looking for a bit of fun and some gory action, then watch it. What you have to remember is that this film wasn't intended to be a Hollywood smash. It's basically a budget movie, not to be taken seriously.

144,Sci-FiHorrorFan,This is an underrated Gem of a horror movie!.,10,26 April 2013,"This film shows you how a horror movie should be done with a good cast good acting and beautiful cinematography. I really enjoyed this film i thought it was very entertaining and the reason this film works is many reasons.1 you have a great location for the story to take place in which is of course deep in the woods miles from civilisation and you get the feeling of dread as the movie goes on which is a good thing in a horror film. 2 the directing and acting are all top notch in my opinion and the music throughout the film is very good. 3 this film has a lot of (likeable Characters) yes that's right LIKEABLE characters and that's one thing i really like in a horror film! i like having characters we actually care about rather than some stupid bimbo characters that don't matter at all. That way when characters get killed you actually feel sorry for them because you liked them to begin with. That's one of the big reasons this film succeeds because you care about almost everyone,there were maybe one or two i didn't care much for but that's only because i knew nothing about them,however our four lead characters are extremely likable and sometimes funny and because of this you want them to survive when they get lost out in the woods. This film also holds a lot of tension which is another reason it works well and the film has quite a dark atmosphere and is a little creepy in places too. I will admit this film does have a couple of problems but they are so minor that you barely notice them and the dark atmosphere and tension the film holds more than makes up for it. The film is about a man who is on his way to a job interview and he gets caught up in traffic so he takes another route to try and get to work faster but he ends up taking a wrong turn and he see's a dead animal in the road and gets distracted by it and he accidentally crashes into this other car with flat tires and that's when he gets out and meets all these other people.they are angry about their car at first but then they decide to help him and they all end up helping each other to try and get back home and they end up becoming friends. People say this movie is cliché and i will admit yes it is a little bit sometimes, like when you have a group of people trapped in the middle of nowhere or when people have no telephone reception or no signal. but those clichés did not bother me because the film was so entertaining and fast paced! and it will make you want to keep watching! and i liked the idea of all these people working together to try and get out of the woods. yes i will admit that it was annoying that their cars had broken down but i understand why that was in the film,they had to put that in the film so the story could go on! otherwise there would be no story!.I liked the lead actor Desmond Harrington i thought he was a very solid likable character and I like Eliza Dushku, her character was also very likable and cool and i wanted her to live. I also really liked Jeremy Sisto's Character Scott i thought he was cool and very funny at times and i also liked the character of his wife i thought she was good in the film too and i really enjoyed her back and forth Dialog with Jeremy Sisto i thought those two were hilarious at times! and they both gave good performances. Those are the sort of characters i like in a horror film they were not stupid or annoying they were fun characters that you like and can have a good laugh with and it made you wan't them to live. of course as the story goes on two people are killed by the hillbillies and our remaining four characters have to try and escape from the woods so they all work together and that's what i liked about the film we had characters that helped each other out so when one person was in trouble another person would help that person out and that's what made them proper characters and that's why they deserved to live and while watching the film you'll wan't them to beat up the hillbillies!. At the end of the film there is a big fight with the hillbillies in their cabin that i thought was very good and exciting. if people want a good suspenseful horror movie that is entertaining then i highly recommend this film because in my eyes this film works! and does everything right! and i thought it was a Great film!.",Wrong Turn

A group of young people are stranded in the remote backwoods and come under attack from deranged, in-bred cannibals.The film zips along with a short running time and plenty of shocks. There's some gore, but not really enough gore or nudity for that matter to make it a real ""guilty pleasure"".  There is also a very attractive cast (particularly Eliza Dushku).One of the main problems with the movie is it's lack of originality.

147,clydestuff,Mountain State Travelogue,3,28 March 2004,"""Almost heaven, West Virginia Blue Ridge Mountains, Shenandoah River Life is old there, older than the trees Younger than the mountains, blowing like a breeze""Whatever positive effect the above lyrics from the late John Denver's ode to West Virginia may or may not have had on tourism, it is totally negated by director Rob Schmidt's nasty little horror film, Wrong Turn. According to screen writer Alan B. McElroy and Schmidt, the old life that is older than the trees is a family of in-bred mutated deranged family members. Think of Sloth from The Goonies, with a little more makeup, a whole lot more ugliness, and you'll be on the right track.  Unlike Sloth though, these family members are far from lovable and among other things practice cannibalism on the good citizens and tourists of West Virginia.  I'm surprised the governor hasn't sued.Over the opening credits of Wrong Turn, we are shown newspaper clips dealing with a boat load of missing people in West Virginia, and other articles dealing with vague headlines of inbred mountain men.  At least the film doesn't hesitate to let us know what's in store for the next 84 minutes, or possibly 82 by the time the opening credits finish so it does give us one last chance to escape.  As usual for these by the numbers horror films we have a kooky melange of teenagers, whom having failed the state proficiency exam, inexplicably serve themselves up as a smorgasbord.  Well, perhaps they're a bit older than that but you get the point.  Medical student Chris Flynn (Desmond Harrington) is in a hurry to get to Raleigh North Carolina for unexplained and probably unimportant reasons.  When the main highway is closed off due to a chemical spill, he goes speeding off onto an old back woods road and promptly plows into the vehicle of the rest of the cast.  For our purposes the rest of the cast are as follows: Jessie (Eliza Dushku), who is in a state of moodiness after having been dumped by her fellow. Scott(Jeremy Sisto), who carries on a continuous early monologue with himself.  I think he does this to drown out his annoying girl friend Carly (Emmanuelle Chriqui).  These films always have to have one member of the party who's grates on our nerves more than the others.  Last and least there's  Evan(Kevin Zegers) and Francine (Lindy Booth)who are here mainly to serve themselves up as appetizers for our deranged killers, Larry, Curly and Moe.  In the film credits they are actually referred to as Three-Finger, Saw-Tooth, and One-Eye.  It doesn't take a pre-med student to figure out why either.Of course, unable to get a connection with a cell phone (Apparently no matter where you are in West Virginia, according to Schmidt there's not much chance of that and never having used a Cell Phone in West Virginia I can't attest to how true this may or may not be)our intrepid explorers must fend for themselves and hike down the road to get help.  Except for poor Evan and Francine of course, who stay behind to help get things going.  From that point on you can write the rest of the script yourself.A lot of what draws screaming teenagers to these films is the amount of gore, bloodletting, torture, and scenes of depravity are contained within the predictable story that they can hoot and holler at.  Those who make films like Wrong Turn see this as a way to make up for the lack of any true suspense, the ineptitude of the characters being lined up for slaughter, and the total idiocy of the whole scenario.  Wrong Turn certainly has it's share of gore, but little else.  We also know that a least one or two of the cast will suddenly develop some initiative in the final frames before the curtain comes down, after having walked through the film with the word stupid tattooed invisibly on their forehead.  I'm not getting any younger, but I still wait for the film where they show a modicum of intelligence from the beginning of the story instead of waiting till the Director is ready to wrap.There is not much point in discussing the acting prowess of anyone associated with Wrong Turn.  The only characters who were the least bit interesting were a toothless guy at a gas station, and Jeremy Sisto's Scott who was kind of quirky and fun for a while.  Scott was almost enough for me to let this film get by with a rating of D, but unfortunately Schmidt gummed up the works by tacking in the obligatory sequel setting scene over the credits.  When you do that, I have no choice but to drop you down a notch or two and give you my grade which for Wrong Turn is an F.",Wrong Turn

And then I amazed by this. Yes, everything in this movie fit all the cliché of the slasher movies should be, but it perfectly in the right track.  It taking inspired from the 70's and 80' slasher, so we cannot blame it if it follow it predecessor. And thankfully it gets the same grace (or more?). It's a damned good homage to those classics.The plot is campy as horror movies does. A bunch of kid got a wrong turn in a wood and everything goes erroneous when they convene with this cannibalistic inbred brothers. A bloody carnage with excessively gore will satisfy the fans of the genre. I cannot claim Wrong Turn as a classic, but with many soap-operatic slashers came out lately, made the genre stuck. Thanks to Jeepers Creepers, now many talented directors think they should back in the root and come with a good result. Yes, I highly recommend this if you're looking for a good and well package slasher. Solid action and scary thrill that will make you chill. Once is not enough.

154,flickershows,Eating Eliza Dushku,5,9 May 2004,"'Wrong Turn' makes a serious effort to scare the pants off its audience. Director Rob Schmidt and producer Stan Winston are clearly trying to get back to horror basics, even though 'Scream' has made us forever self-aware when we're watching fright flicks. There's something retro in seeing the luscious Eliza Dushku run away from the baddies in terror. She's not cracking wise about the genre she's in. So does that earnest approach make this movie worth your time? Well, not really. I was never scared or even grossed out, despite the obvious bloody homages to the original 'Texas Chain Saw Massacre'.It seems that the backwoods area of Virginia houses 3 deformed mountain men who trap (then murder and devour) anyone who dares to enter their turf. Dushku and her 4 forgettable buddies meet up with doctor-to-be Desmond Harrington when he smashes his bitchin' ride into their broken-down truck. Following their Teen Idiot Guidebook, they do everything wrong and---one by one---end up dead. The better-known actors survive longer. Really, you've seen all this before. There are tiny moments of tension, but no real bona fide scares. Okay, there's one cool decapitation up in a tall tree.Winston's F/X team took great pains to create 3 ugly villains. They have no personality and aren't nearly as creepy as past horror icons, but they sure are ugly. Along with their teenaged victims, the trio of weirdos try to give a good performance in spite of a script written purely to get their characters from Point A to Point Z. So if there's nothing truly original and it isn't scary, should you bother renting the DVD? Horror buffs might enjoy seeing 'Wrong Turn' because of its efforts to fit into the large shoes of 'The Exorcist', 'Texas Chain Saw Massacre', and even 'Deliverance'. Unfortunately, it's gore-flecked feet just CAN'T fill those shoes.",Wrong Turn
155,Boggman,A wrong turn done the right way!!!!,10,10 June 2005,"This movie WORKS on many levels. Good actors, a solid storyline that doesn't drag, great make-up and visual affects, and fast paced directing make this movie a must see for the serious horror fan. Wrong Turn is a great throwback to the classic horror movies of the 70's and 80's, with the an excellent production budget which a lot of the older classics simply could not afford to have.Wrong Turn did not disappoint this reviewer, and I really think it's too easy to compare this movie to ""Deliverance"", as other reviewers have. Regardless, I would rather watch these guys chase Eliza Dushku through the woods and up the trees any day than to watch Ned Beatty squeal like a pig! :-) Wrong turn is a truly scary and very creepy horror film. I get the ""willies"" every time I watch it! You really want these characters to make it out alive. Dushku is fantastic in her role as the strong female survivor. She plays it with everything she's got and it shows! The scene in which she is taken back to the cabin and tied to the bed.....well, it's a great piece of acting just as good as any of our beloved scream queens from years past.The rest of the cast also delivers consistently throughout the film. All in all this is a great film and a class apart from what has been released to us horror fans in the last few years. I enjoyed it tremendously, and would recommend this movie to anyone who is a horror film fan!!",Wrong Turn
156,Snake-666,Interesting modern take on 70's exploitation flicks.,6,7 October 2003,"Following a car crash on a desolate stretch of road, Chris (Desmond Harrington), Jessie (Eliza Dusku) and four other teenagers find themselves lost in the woods and under attack by a family of cannibalistic mountain men.'Wrong Turn' is a movie that harks back to the exploitation films of the 1970's, particularly 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre' (1974) and 'The Hills Have Eyes' (1977). Sadly this movie lacks the raw grittiness that made the aforementioned movies so entertaining. That is not to say 'Wrong Turn' is not enjoyable, in fact, I found it a rather interesting modern update of the 70's exploitation flicks. The main problem with 'Wrong Turn' is the typical, over-dramatic, Hollywood style soundtrack. 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre' managed to instil fear in its viewers without feeling the need to increase the volume a few decibels during every `scary' part. 'Wrong Turn' is fairly unnerving in its own right and does not need the loud soundtrack to improve the story. If anything the movie is damaged by the increasingly over-dramatic soundtrack which has very little originality to it anyway.Rob Schmidt directed 'Wrong Turn' and did so with a fairly good degree of competence. From the wonderfully crafted opening scenes, all the way to the dark and eerie ending, Schmidt managed to construct an almost continuously sinister atmosphere featuring some intelligent camerawork and good special effects. 'Wrong Turn' also deserves credit for the lack of CGI, a rare occurrence these days in a movie. Instead of CGI, the filmmakers chose to use the type of gory effects so prevalent in the films 'Wrong Turn' takes influence from. Accompanying the special effects were some fairly well constructed make-up effects for the inbred cannibals, a little unoriginal perhaps, but nonetheless convincing and relatively threatening. 'Wrong Turn' also benefited from some good performances from the cast, particularly Desmond Harrington and Eliza Dushku. Alas, Emmanuelle Chriqui became little more than an annoyance after a while with her constant pathetic squealing.I'd say that 'Wrong Turn' is worth checking out for horror fans. While not being as good, or original, as many of the 70's exploitation flicks it possesses some enthralling scenes and an awareness for the movies that influenced it. There are flaws, but fewer than with most of the Hollywood horror films currently being released. Fans of recent horror should enjoy this movie a lot but I think fans of the older horror films will not be quite as impressed. Enjoyable nonetheless! My rating for 'Wrong Turn' - 7/10.",Wrong Turn

There were a few idiotic moments with some of the characters but it doesn't ruin it.We know the villains are inbreds but the good thing is, it doesn't show any personal rape scenes or incest scenes which I thought was very good thing.The make up effects were excellent and looked very realistic and very freaky. The great thing is, I think it didn't really concentrate on the gore, but on the disturbing and the scares. I thought it was very disturbing and the scare scenes kept my on the edge of my seat.There are some gore scenes but not all the way through the film which is a good thing.

160,mfnmbvp,'Wrong Turn' (2003),6,9 March 2012,"'Wrong Turn' is set up right from the get-go to be our typical classic horror thriller. It's not set to break any new ground or cross any boundaries into a higher territory of filmmaking. The actors are occasionally self-aware, like they know going into the woods is a bad idea, but they do it anyway because they're stranded with no car. Jeremy Sisto is good in this aspect of the film, because he plays off of his self-awareness as if he knows what is in store for all of them. I wish he would become a staple in horror films, just so we could hear him scream and yell and flee in terror more often.The titles of the film give us the gist of what is happening around here, showing us clips of old newspapers. The first one they show us is the name of the newspaper: The West Virginian, but all they show us is the words West Virginia. And then Mountain Men. It's like they were trying to write the synopsis for the back of the DVD case during the titles of the film. Regardless, our actors march off into the woods, leaving Kevin Zegers and his girlfriend to be horribly butchered. Emmanuelle Chriqui's role is expertly annoying, Desmond Harrington is really the only good thing about this movie, Eliza Dushku is slightly attractive, but that doesn't save her character from being dull and lifeless, and just being driven through the film as if she was a puppet on a string. The film was written by Alan McElroy, who is the man that wrote 'Halloween 4' back in 1988. I wonder how long he had this story sitting around collecting dust for. Probably since the inception of the original 'The Texas Chain Saw Massacre', and they finally got around to producing 'Wrong Turn' the same year that Michael Bay decided they were going to go ahead and remake 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre'. Ebert gave 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre' remake zero stars. I tried to find his review for 'Wrong Turn'. He doesn't have one. It's a shame too, because I was really looking forward to hearing him tear this film apart page by page. There are a few nice shots in the movie; the art direction is well-done. The script never lets down, it goes hard until the very end. But it's just so terribly formulaic at this point, that even though 'The Hills Have Eyes' remake wouldn't surface for another three years, people today will just think to themselves, why watch 'Wrong Turn' when I can watch 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre' or 'The Hills Have Eyes' remakes instead?WRONG TURN -----6/10.",Wrong Turn

As I indicated in my subject line, here is another ""who is going to survive to the end movie."" At least the annoying characters were taken care of from the start .. score one, two, three, four, for the genetically and literally bloodthirsty cretins. They were so cool, I almost expected to see a whiskey gin and lurking Revenuers. Now, THAT would have made this film more enjoyable watching the Revenuers get hacked up, but gosh, we'd be rooting for the cretins and we can't have that in Maullywood. The gore in this one was overdone, but admit that the quick clips of it sent me cringing in my seat. The special effects done on the cretins was excellent. As my mind got bored with the storyline and the typical stupidity of ""gee, we best run out of this shack and forget to grab something to defend ourselves, or maybe those car keys in the bowl?"" ... I snickered inside at the thought of the actors traipsing around in their elephant-man-like get ups and can only imagine how they really didn't have to exhibit acting skills at all .. just laugh, laugh, laugh. There comes a point in these movies where the storyline is so bad, you gotta at least see the cretins for your money's worth, or else leave the theater. I'm not a gore or scary movie watcher, but have to say that even with the thin script, this movie did scare me, which lent my relative higher score. Perhaps it scared me more to think there really are lame ditsy people as portrayed in this flick ... and a real horror is that one was portrayed as a doctor .. omigawd! do such doctor's exist? On another note, another wrong-turn type movie, Disappearance, was equally intense to me, but at least it didn't have the gore ... it wasn't necessary to keep me interested to the end. As I said, I'm not much of a horror viewer and notice more of this survivor theme bleeding into television more and more, which is even more frightening that ... YES, there really ARE lame ditzes in real life! So, on that note I gave this movie a 7 for portraying such ditzes getting knocked off! And, my score is higher mostly for the excellent cretin get-ups.

In the traditon of Texas Chainsaw Massacre,Last House on the Left and The Hills Have Eyes...comes Wrong Turn.Leading out the cast is Eliza Dushku(Bring It On)plays the herione in this flick and has a great body while doin it to.Desmond Harrington(Ghost Ship)plays the hero,but in a quiet tone and it makes him look cool blooded.Emmauelle Chriqui(Swimfan)didn't really like her role,not her, just the role.But had SPOLIER...a great death.I mean an ax between the mouth is a sweet death.Jeremy Sisto(May)play his role and yet again made me like him.He's such a to kool for school actor,don't you think.Lindy Booth(The Famous Jett Jackson)had a short role,but looks too fine,when I go to hollywood.I hope she gives me a call.Kevin Zegers(Air Bud)has grown indeed,but still has a small role.Stan Winston(the master of makeup)has done another great job with these brother.My favorite was Three-Fingers.This is one of the best horror film of ever.",Wrong Turn

People getting chopped to pieces. Masked killers. Monsters that won't die.Well ""Wrong turn"" follows that list pretty well, leaving out just a few of all the typical clichés you might expect from a movie like this. But to say this movie is original is to really overestimate it, even though it actually leaves out the whole ""Masked killers"" bit.""Wrong Turn"" is clearly influenced by (or ripping off) ""Deliverence"", ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" and ""The hills have eyes"", obviously the makers of this movie were so proud that they even had one of the characters saying that the situation they were in reminded him a whole lot of ""Deliverence"". But enough of all that about this movie being a rip off now. To be honest this movie actually can stand a bit on it's own. Sure, it's not really scary, it's not original in any way but on the other hand it has OK gore, not too bad atmosphere and some pretty ladies.OK entertainment for a lonely night, but nothing you'll remember for more than a couple of hours.",Wrong Turn
172,Dkish,What's worse than a leather-faced madman chasing you through the bush with a chainsaw? How about three!!,8,30 May 2003,"What's worse than a leather-faced madman chasing you through the bush with a chainsaw? How about three!!`Wrong Turn' stars Desmond Harrington as Chris Finn, a man who is late for a very important interview. Finn takes a back country road to avoid a traffic jam and ends up involved in a car accident with three debutantes (Eliza Dushku, Lindy Booth and Emmanuelle Chriqui) and their boyfriends (Jeremy Sisto and Kevin Zegers). The group splits up as they try to find some help. Unbeknownst to them, they are being stalked by an unspeakable horror. Living in the woods around the crash is a family of cannibalistic mountain men who are overtly grotesque from generations of incest. Before the group knows it, they are in a fight for their very lives.`Wrong Turn' was in one word an utter shock to the system. There hasn't been a film this gory, grotesque and chilling in a very long time. Not since the 1970's `Texas Chainsaw Massacre' has a horror film such as this been made. The best way to describe the experience is that if you took 2001's `Joy Ride' and `Jeepers Creepers' added 1972's `Deliverance' then threw them all in a blender. You may come up with `Wrong Turn'.The tension in this film is harrowing and relentless as it bats you back and forth. You are exhausted and maybe even queasy when you come out of the theatre. But if you love horror films then you probably have an ear to ear grin as well.I really liked some of the early editing of this film by director Rob Schmidt, who allows the scares and shocks to come with brilliant accuracy. I also liked how Schmidt barely shows the mountain men throughout the film. The parts we do see are horrific but the filmmaker relies heavily on the chase and shock than on the gore. Schmidt could have easily dived down the gore shoot to hell but he made a wise choice that works in spades.It's the film's harrowing tension and atmospheric pursuit that overshadows the young stars that make up the cast. Dushku is strong and emulates some of her `Buffy the Vampire Slayer' character, Faith in her portrayal here. Dushku loves to play debutantes with edge and her character here has a lot of it. I wasn't extremely familiar with Desmond Harrington before this film but he plays a good leading man. The rest of the cast play typical generic 20-somethings from the horror film franchises of old. I have always liked Lindy Booth but she has nothing to play with here and the same is goes for Jeremy Sisto. But come on, this isn't exactly an intelligently written and detailed drama.I liked `Wrong Turn' purely because of its shock value and its no holds barred return to classic horror. It is always in your face and it doesn't let go till the credits. This film isn't for the faint of heart. What a rush! (3.5 out of 5) So Says the Soothsayer.",Wrong Turn
173,MoviesReviews101,Verdict: Still Want to go to the Woods?,7,8 November 2014,"Story: We start by seeing two students being taken from the rock climbing exercise followed by the news clippings of all the disappearance over the years. This makes the backstory of the cannibals complete. We then get to follow one of our heroes as he is desperately trying to make his way across country for a big interview, before crashing into five friends who have had a tire blowout. The group split up to try and find help but soon find themselves the latest targets of the cannibals. When this first hit the screens the genre of cannibals was nowhere to be seen, this put everything back on the map. Though the story is very much the same as the whole stuck in the woods idea of previous times. We do get to see the survival attempts mixed in with the fight against an enemy they didn't expect to go up against. It is good that we don't get any silly horror mistakes, with the group trying to stay together; it is also good that we don't see too much detail about how long everything had been going on, though I would have liked to have seen some potential warning ignored by the groups. In the end it is a solid horror story that never really challenges the audience.

174,liodavix,Surprise ... B series clear.,8,13 February 2019,"Wrong Turn, detour to hell is one of those very pleasant surprises that horror cinema gives you from time to time.The story revolves around six young people who, by taking a shortcut through a forest, go to the hands of a kind of tribe of wild men. These savages, cannibals, of monstrous and primitive aspect, and with a particularly violent and sadistic character, will begin to hunt them as if they were simple prey.It is a film, that although it has all the topics of the genre is splendidly directed, with an excellent montage and photography.The characters are defined in their proper measure, with actors that perfectly fulfill each one in their role.Highlight especially the powerful and beautiful Eliza Dushku (Angel, True Calling, Buffy the vampire slayer), a quite correct Jeremy Sisto, (Law and Order, Julio Cesar), and Lindy Booth (Cazatesoros, 4400, CSI), a beautiful redhead that distills authentic morbo everywhere.The scenes of suspense and action are very successful, the sequences like the chase through the treetops or the macabre sequences in the cabin of the savages are made with a great tension and sense of rhythm.A more than remarkable horror film, original, daring and fantastically done, although never, I repeat, never be a B-series film.",Wrong Turn

176,mbworm,good but it needs better effects,7,24 August 2005,"Genuinely scary and at some moments surprisingly unpredictable, ""Wrong Turn"" turns out to be a cut above most of the modern updates of the slasher genre. Director Rob Schmidt brings fresh scares and tension to the table with this must see, fast-paced gorefest.Eliza Dushku leads a cast that, although clichéd in the fact that all of the main stars have major visual appeal, still proves to be of good diversity and play off each other surprisingly well. Among them are well known players Jeremy Sisto (Thirteen), Lindy Booth (Cry Wolf, Dawn of the Dead), Kevin Zegers (Dawn of the Dead) and the equally talented Emanuelle Chriqui and Desmond Harrington.It's your typical backwoods ""stumble upon the insane family"" plot but Schmidt crafts the fast story well. After a car accident, the group of youngsters wanders off to find help and find themselves instead at a hellish cabin full of grisly objects (and other nasty surprises.) And then of course it turns out that three cannibal inbred mountain men live here, and they're just getting in. From here the tension literally never ends and is almost unbearable. As soon as the men discover our stars, who are hiding in various places of the house, a cat and mouse game ensues with a lot of gory twists and nail-biting chase scenes.You really can't predict scenes ahead in this thriller. It keeps you on edge until the highly satisfying ending. A real jolter, but only effective the first time you see it, with loads of gore and screams for avid horror fans.",Wrong Turn

Meh...,7,9 June 2007,"If you've seen ""The Hills Have Eyes"", ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"", ""Hostel"", or ""Turistas"", then this one won't be utterly amazing, but even so, it'll be something to watch on the side, (without falling asleep) when you're bored to tears.I guess I could say that this one is similar to ""The Hills Have Eyes: Part II"". (the older one) It's good, it's creative, and it's mostly original, but it's nothing spectacular. It IS, however, (or it was to me), rather funny that the story revolves around inbred cannibals in the mountains of Virginia, of all places...Anyway, if you're looking for an ""Eh"" B-film, this is a pretty good one.

The first 10 minutes of this film are pretty slow, but once the first murder is committed the pace really picks up and doesn't let up until the very final scene when the main protagonist and his co survivor drive off and escape from the grizzly hell they've just been subjected to. A couple of the camera angles are a bit dodgy, as is some of the acting by one of the supporting actresses in the film, but other than it's scripted quite well, and the main actor/actress do 'being scared' very well. As for the bad guys, well, there all kinda deformed (which to be honest I didn't get), but also quite menacing, and overall convincing in their roles as the local deranged folk killing tourists for seemingly no reason, other than the fact they may have taken the 'Wrong Turn' into their neck of the woods.So to conclude, the film is a great way to spend an hour and half curled up next to a loved one or hiding behind a cushion, either way this film is (fairly) good and does the trick of producing some quite tense moments. 4/10- 2*.",Wrong Turn

We have the sexualised teens that doing also drugs, we have the ""clown"", we have a really dumb girl and of course, the final girl, that you detect from the first minute, because she's very serious. Then we have our protagonist (final guy) that has something like a fling with the final girl, but not really at the same time.So, only from the group, you understand that this film I a typical cliché film in the woods. I knew from the beginning who was going to die. It was very expected the flow of the film, that I knew the order of the victims.A character from the film was suuuper dumb, that I wanted to give her a punch!The cannibals were like caricature. They had cringey laugh. The gore metre was mediocre to high. It's not a splatter film, but I would give a good 7/10 in the gore section.I liked the scene where the sole survivors were hiding in a watchtower and were trying to communicate with the police.P. S.

185,Unicorn-9,Scooby Doo vs the inbred Southern cannibal mutants,2,22 February 2004,"Ok, I did finally get around to watching this movie to the end, but from the 'Seven'-ripoff credits at the start I should have known better. While obviously made to a much higher technical standard than the horror B-movies of the 70s and 80s, it was a stale, predictable, by-the-numbers 'teen' slaughter movie that had nothing of the charm of the movies it's clearly ripping off (most obviously 'Texas Chainsaw Massacre', though at times it also reminded me of 'Motel Hell').The biggest problem is that it's just soulless. It really has no reason to exist other than to gorily kill off a few people, and that's it: beyond that facade there's nothing. I'd say something about the characters, but there really aren't any: just cardboard cutouts straight from 'How to write a horror movie in 24 hours'... and that's the 'good guys'; the 'bad guys' aren't even as solid as cardboard. It's as though it was written as a parody but the director got confused and shot it as a serious movie. Honestly, with all the good movies that could have been made about inbred Southern cannibal mutants, why make this one?Otherwise the story is short and poorly paced, and what about all those 'I've got a helicopter and I'm going to use it' aerial shots? Yes, we know they're in a wood, you don't have to keep showing us... I doubt that even the target audience of twelve year olds are that lacking in attention span that they'd have forgotten so quickly.Best part of the movie was the cleavage shots of the redhead chick... there's not even any decent nudity to make up for the silly script and lack of characterisation. But after about 20 minutes you might as well just switch off, because you've seen the best bits and you'll already have figured out the rest of what passes for a story (even down to the inbred Southern cannibal mutants mysteriously deciding that when they capture our heroine they won't kill her like the others, they'll just tie her up and wait for her to be rescued: I'd list that as a spoiler, but it will be obvious within fifteen minutes of watching the movie). About all that's left are a few gratuitous gore shots, but if you want that then why bother with a second-rater: just watch 'Brain Dead' instead.My final thought, as the end credits rolled, was 'that's the stupidest thing I've ever seen'. With hindsight that's not really true, but it's not far from it: the whole movie is pretty much 'Scooby Doo vs the inbred Southern cannibal mutants', but with less believable characters and a less convincing plot. I'm surprised it didn't end with the inbred Southern cannibal mutants saying 'And we'd have gotten away with it too, if not for those pesky kids!'In fact, had Scooby Doo been in it, it would have been a much, much better movie. Maybe someone should suggest it to James Gunn.",Wrong Turn

WRONG TURN is the story about a group's mission to find help and their fight for survival from a group of unfriendly woodsmen. Desmond Harrington play's Chris, a doctor on his way to a meeting. As he is driving along he comes across a traffic jam. Instead of waiting it out, he turns around and drives down and old dirt road. (The fact that this road isn't paved should be some type of warning sign.) Eliza Dushku, plays Jessie. She is standard with some of her friends after someone placed barbwire on the road. Soon the two cars become close friends and the group is left out in the middle of nowhere. What they thought would be a peaceful walk through the woods soon turns into a fight for their lives.     WRONG TURN is a pretty good horror movie. In fact compared to CABIN FEVER this looks like THE GOD FATHER. There are some surprises and twists that turn this movie into a jaw dropping, heart pounding, adventure. Jeremy Sisto, who resembles Jeff Goldblum in this role, and Emmanuelle Chriqui co-star. The opening sequence is pretty lame; they could have started it out a little better. The acting is good, but like most movies there is always one or two performance that looks like they came from some low budget porn. The makeup on the woodsmen is awesome. (On a side note, does anyone else think that three finger resembles Stephanie from FULL HOUSE?) All in all, this is a pretty good movie. If you're looking for some cheap fun and a few jolts then this is your cup of tea. It's not supposed to be one of the best movies ever made, and it's not trying to be.

The deformed people in the woods were pretty good effects on them(faces and the fact that they can live longer due to the fact that the stuff they drank gives them super-human strength and ability to kill people or act dead for a short while anyway). I mean, those people trying to escape the woods were pretty brave to fight them and live long enough to get back to civilization and never go back to the woods again.

191,BloedEnMelk,Surprisingly entertaining,7,14 March 2011,"The title is chosen well, and from this title it's pretty easy to imagine how our protagonists get into trouble. It all starts out with Chris Flynn (Desmond Harrington, playing Joey Quinn in 'Dexter') who is out for a job interview but ends up in a huge traffic jam, which makes him search for an alternative route. Needless to say that the road he takes is a wrong turn. Driving up a dirt road through mountains and forest, he crashes into an other car. Nobody gets seriously hurt and after the initial shock they split up (of course, after all this is a horror movie). Two stay behind, the other four, including Chris, go to get some help. But they will soon find out that the crash wasn't just an accident, and that there are inbred people living around who's help you really don't want. Do not expect a unique storyline, or an intriguing plot, as you will not find it. It's all basically your typical horror/slasher cliché. But is that always a problem? I would say no. The good thing about Wrong Turn is that it never gets boring. I have seen many horror movies, and though I do definitely prefer a movie with an original storyline, at times it's just really entertaining to see an average story worked out well enough, without any real pretensions. There's a 'pleasant' creepy tension that goes on throughout the film, it had me glued to the screen the whole time. It's not a movie in which people get slaughtered non-stop (though certainly not everyone survives), but what you have is the constant threat that they might get slaughtered any second. Do the characters have much depth? No, not really. We see nothing more than some hints about their lives. But again, does it matter? Nah.... as long as I am entertained enough, I forgive the writers. The actors do a good job in being believable, which I dó find really important. Eliza Dushku plays her part well as a no-bullshit young woman, and though at times I couldn't help but seeing her as the sexy vampire slayer Faith (Buffy the Vampire Slayer), you will not hear me complain about that. Desmond Harrington did a fine job too, and he and Eliza had good chemistry going on. All-in-all, I really liked Wrong Turn. Yes, it has many flaws and lacks originality, but there is nothing wrong with the acting and it has enough creepiness and tension to add a fine movie to it's genre.

In Craven's film, a family gets stuck out in the desert and gets attacked by a family of cannibals. In ""Wrong Turn,"" a group of young people (probably a '90s influence) get stuck in the back woods of West Virginia, and get attacked by a family of cannibals.I love horror movies like ""The Hills Have Eyes"" and ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre,"" so ""Wrong Turn"" was a pleasure to watch.

Obviously, the plot of ""Wrong Turn"" is very simple and cliché, but it still kind of works. In fact, the film is slightly better than most, but not on par with slasher classics such as ""Scream."" The acting is pretty believable and the dialogue is acceptable. The cinematography is pretty good as well, although there is (at least) one CGI shot that is incredibly bad, unnecessary and annoying. If you like horror, you'll enjoy this movie, but you won't love it. If you don't like horror, steer clear. It definitely gives off an X-Files vibe from time to time with ""Deliverance"" and ""The Hills Have Eyes"" thrown in as well. In fact, there is a reference to ""Deliverance"" in the film. The message of the film (if there is one) is a little problematic ethically - It is sad that our society has to immediately assume that someone who is disfigured is an insane murderer. Instead of this, I'd recommend ""The Hills Have Eyes"" or ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning."" They are both better, more complicated, and have more of a message. Plus, they had higher budgets, which resulted in much better effects. 6 out of 10",Wrong Turn

Most likely the best of the affectionately dubbed ""slasher"" genre (definately the best of those I have seen), Wrong Turn features Eliza Dushku (a relatively fine-looking lead actress) and a bevy of other near insignificants in the grand scheme of things.Sure, it features those ridiculously foolish blunders that seemingly all of the existing movies of the slasher genre suffers from-- stupid mistakes made by characters that would only occur in the movies, unbelievable stunts and scenarios (such as the centre of the plot for the latter, and the leap from the burning watch tower for the former), and poor acting by some of the cast (the police are boring and suspiciously dim-witted). However, it also features the most relentless start-to-end action I have witnessed in any of the genre's films.Thus, Wrong Turn ranks as the number one gore-fest in my books.6/10.",Wrong Turn

Cabin Fever the flaws are planned and enhance the movie, Wrong Turn..was there a movie amidst the flaws??  I'm willing to suspend disbelief for a while but come on PU LEEEZE!  I'm no doctor but USUALLY a shotgun wound to the back of the calf keeps someone from hiking, climbing 100 foot tall ladders, maneuvering from pine tree limb to pine tree limb, running, jumping, and all without pain.  In the dark USUALLY you can see 3 large mutants carrying torches from above, while they might have a hard time seeing you.  If you manage to sneak out of a mutant murderer's house, USUALLY you don't slam the screen door and scream on the way out.  If you leave a truck with its lights on all night, USUALLY the battery runs dead.  Usually fires tend to spread especially when you throw three molotov cocktails in the same room.  I'm sorry Eliza I watched this because you were in it and if anything was skewed towards liking this, but I can hear even in your commentary that you're just being nice because the director is there w/ you.

I wasn't expecting much from the previews and from what the plot was, but this movie actually lived up to the many classic horror movies that it was based on. I was on the edge of my seat the whole movie, and my heart pumped like crazy. This movie isn't for the faint of heart. It's very scary and very intense. It is absolutely the best horror film in years! It reminded me of Jeepers Creepers and infact Deliverance (which they reference in the movie!), but it has many twists and turns along the way. Best of all, the ending leaves it open for a sequel, which hopefully will happen! The mutant and canniballistic mountain men were just as scary as Hannibal Lectre or Michael Myers (famous movie monsters), and much scarier than the others (Freddy, Jason, Chucky, ect.). I applaud the director of this film, because he made the terror level high and the script didn't have any brief humor or jokes that most horror movies have. I recommend Wrong turn to all horror fans out there, and even to non horror fans. Your in for the shock of your life!",Wrong Turn
201,pc_dean,The Hills Have Cliches,4,10 June 2003,"Well, the title's accurate, I'll give them that. Wrong Turn feels a little like a movie out of time, a holdover from that period in the late 90s when latter-day horror movies were all the rage.  Those movies took the formula of the slasher movies popular over the previous decade, and injected a hip, self-aware sense of irony into them.  We screamed, we laughed, we found out all about what people did last summer.  As movie after movie tried to cash in on the revival, though, all the cleverness leaked out of the genre, leaving merely re-hashed versions of the old splatter flicks.  As they say, here we go again. You know the story, sing along:  Six photogenic twentysomethings end up stranded in The Middle of Nowhere RFD, where they become prey for a clan of freakish savages who live far from the bounds of civilization (you know this because cell phones won't work).  There's slicing, and dicing, and creepy houses in the woods, and, oh, you know.  That's pretty much it.  Just another iteration of what I like to call the `NRA Plot'; that is, one that would be resolved by the end of the second reel if any of the principal characters had thought to bring a repeating rifle or two.  Or if they had at the very least taken one of the thuddingly obvious opportunities they are given to procure one.Most movies of this type use a rather generic setting, so as to fudge the fact that it's really the Angeles National Forest.  In contrast, Wrong Turn sets its bloodletting in `Greenbriar Back Country', West Virginia, the state that most frequently ends up on the wrong side of Americans' regional elitism.  We are treated to several helicopter shots sweeping over the treetops, as thundering ominous music plays in the background, like some sort of travelogue made by Wes Craven.  Message: we're in scary country, folks.  Like most movies of this type, the heavy subtext of Wrong Turn is all about urbanites' uneasiness about rural areas and the people who live there.  After all, the reasoning goes, if someone chooses not to live in the city, with its all-night delis and trash pickup, well, there must be something WRONG with them, mustn't there?  Naturally, pretty much everyone the protagonists encounter is a toothless, oil-stained stereotype of various degrees of grotesqueness (not too many, though - we don't want to blow the makeup budget).  Don't look for this movie to play too long in Wheeling.  Actually, Wrong Turn was filmed in a very pretty part of Ontario, but we digress. It feels a little unfair to pile on this movie: director Rob Schmidt, who made Crime and Punishment in Suburbia, gives it the old college try (specifically, Shrieking Coed U.)  It's not totally awful, it's at least competently put together, and even provides a decent scare or two.  But it doesn't break any new ground, it doesn't play with the conventions of the genre, it doesn't bring anything fresh. We've seen the `pretty young things get picked off like guests at an Agatha Christie weekend retreat' plot innumerable times before, and the `urban travelers' terror of predatory rural folk' theme in Deliverance, The Hills Have Eyes, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Breakdown, and Southern Comfort, to name just a few.  I'd always thought The Blair Witch Project was over-hyped and overrated, but I have to say it's looking better and better. The young cast turns in serviceable performances, hampered as they are by the hackneyed dialogue.  Desmond Harrington, in particular, makes a good laconic hero, and Eliza Dushku a likable but prickly heroine.  On the other hand, Jeremy Sisto's junior-college Jeff Goldblum schtick becomes wearying very quickly. From its extraneous-characters-get-pureed opening to its painfully obvious `surprise' finale, Wrong Turn is just a heaping plate of the same old same-old. Characters poke around the mandatory spooky cabin, finding enough ominous clues that it would be clear to the functionally brain-dead that YOU ARE IN A BAD PLACE.  GET OUT.  But, these are horror movie characters, people evidently born without whatever gene it is that promotes self-preservation.I suppose it's a matter of taste: if you just can't get enough of this type of plot, by all means, see Wrong Turn.  There are far worse examples out there.  But even by the standards of cheap horror movies (which I admit to a certain fondness for), it's just middling fare, painted entirely by the numbers.  Frankly, it may be childish, but just once I would like to see a movie about a pack of demented hilljack freakshows who run across a van-load of vacationing Green Berets, played by Samuel L. Jackson, Michael Ironside, William Fichtner, and Hugo Weaving.  It'd be a very short movie, but it would at least be a refreshing change of pace, which Wrong Turn is definitely not.",Wrong Turn
202,MadWatch,Almost worth the money,4,23 June 2003,"This movie does not offer anything new that has not been done or seen in a movie before. It looked like it had a low production value (which isn't necessarily a bad thing), so, if the gore level was reduced about half, this could have easily passed for a made for TV movie. If this was the case, Wrong Turn would have been a really good made-for-TV movie. Therefore it was not quite worth actually paying money for in a theater, but I also don't feel as if I lost 2 hours of my life.The plot was super simple, but the acting was very good. The effects were excellent, at least for what was needed because of the simplicity of the plot.If you want to see a generic, gory, 'a bunch of people are lost and get killed one by one' type of movie, then go see Wrong Turn.",Wrong Turn
203,gimili3979,Wrong Turn is an example of a great cult classic horror movie,8,11 March 2021,"Wrong Turn (2003) is an example of how horror movies used to be made. I remember seeing this movie for the first time and never looking at my watch. It is short and gets straight to the point. But what really sets it apart is how realistic it felt. Whenever I have gone hiking in the forest I think about this movie.This is a movie where they do not use sex and violence to make the horror movie work. There are always hints at both, but not like the movies you see today. It is the suspense in this film that keeps you watching. That is the horror and probably why so many people like this movie. And it is also probably why so many people check out the remakes(which I think are all ""sequel"" movies and not very good).They could never rehash the magic from the original film. I think this is because the original had a story that felt true. A med student named Chris Flynn gets stuck in highway traffic. He is in a hurry and cannot afford the time to wait so he decides to try some back roads. And the story goes from there.But the main point of this film is that you can see this happening to you. And that is the magic of this film. The missing person posters, the random car trying a shortcut, the group of friends going for a trip to camp in the woods, it is all believable.Yes, one of the female characters is kind of annoying and whiny. And it is not award winning acting. But Wrong Turn is that rare example of an ""average"" movie that people can relate to because the story feels real and the suspense creates the horror. It is hard to find horror movies ""like"" this anymore.I highly recommend seeing this film.",Wrong Turn

Its not about that. This is something you should know before watching a movie like this. The movie is about excitement and gore. There is no nudity in this one, which it didn't need. This movie is an edge-of-your-seat thrill ride. From the horrors in the inbreds' cabin to the climb through the trees for their lives, you will not be bored.I give this movie a 6 out of 10, which is as high a rating as I can give to such a weak plot. I loved it though, but probably wont see it again. I usually prefer horror movies with good plots, like 'A Nightmare on Elm Street' (All of them), 'The Ring' (My favourite big budget), and 'The House That Screamed II' (My favourite micro budget). For gore hounds, though, this movie is great. I even recommend it for people like me who are big on plots, just for a little excitement to mix things up.

The inbreeding factor that explains their existence while the opening credits are rolling is lifted out of an X-Files episode that is very similar.

209,leorican,"""We are never going into the the woods again""",8,5 November 2005,"""Wrong Turn"" is a slick, good looking, straight ahead throwback to the old ""creeper in the woods"" horror genre. It's setup is simple. A med student on his way to an appointment comes across a traffic jam on the highway and decides to take a detour through a back road in West Virginia. While on this road his attention is drawn to the dead carcass of a deer which causes him to accidentally hit a jeep sitting in the middle of the road. The jeep, carrying five friends who luckily were not in the vehicle when it is hit, had its tires blown out by some barb wire that was lying across the road. Realizing the Jeep's fate was not an accident after finding the wire, three of the friends and the med student decide to go and look for help down the road. What they don't know is that three murderous inbreed siblings live in the surrounding woods and what happens next and what they find down the road is delivered in this movie in shear form of relentless horror with no apologies made. The cast is lead by Eliza Dushku and Desmond Harrington who are perfect in the leads and Jeremy Sisto does a great take on Jeff Goldblum. The siblings are horrifying even when you don't see their faces but only glimpses of the backs and body parts as the creep after and hunt the group. They're are scenes, especially the ones set in the cabin house, which will make you squirm in your seat and there are some sudden shocks that you don't see coming, especially toward the end and they are executed in grand style. Lets just say an ax and arrow are involved. A must see for all you 70's horror fans. A warning though....don't stop watching as soon as the credits start to roll...Movie makers are making it hard to just get up and go these days...because they always have a little something more for you...so sit tight and get ready to scream......And for pete's sake...don't go into the woods!!!",Wrong Turn

Six people with predictable personalities, trapped in the woods, with a monster of choice lurking around waiting to dismember them.This kind of movies usually are fun, even if they are bad. I enjoyed the camera work of ""Wrong Turn"", which included a couple of inspired shots. It failed to create even a remotely suspenseful scene, but maybe I'm just desensitized.The cast doesn't provide much hope. Eliza Dushku is hittable and she finds herself tied to a bed in the last quarter of the movie. Apart from that, it's all expendable meat. Jeremy Sisto is the best one in the bunch, and he gets the only character capable of inspiring some sympathy.There are better, much better movies to spend your time with, but if you favor this type of plot, it's not all that bad.

229,terrors89,"Completely Original, except that it is a rip off of Texas Chainsaw Massacre",1,20 October 2005,"You know, I love the story about how a group of teenagers are hunted by a family of psychopath's hell bent on killing each one of them. As each kid continues to buy it the tension builds and you don't know what's going to happen until the climatic ending. Boy the Texas Chainsaw Massacre was an entertaining movie, but if you want to see a cheap, poorly made, imitation that sucks as much as the female actress breasts bounce in their t-shirts, then by all means, get this movie, because it blows.So this young stud, Chris, played by Desmond Harrington (We Were Soldiers,) is late for a meeting and there is a huge accident on the highway, so he back tracks and goes down this dirt road in bum-f*cked West Virginia where he runs into, literally, a van full of young adults, led by the unexplainable single Jessie, played by Eliza Dushku (True Lies,) looking for sex and fun. So when they discover that the road was booby trapped by someone, four of the six, go looking for help, while the remaining red shirts, I am sorry, I mean teenagers, stay with the cars to both die violently. So then the remaining four discover that they are being hunted by crazed killer and run around trying to escape and end up all dying except the main two characters.This movie is a complete rip-off of TCM. The amazing thing is that this movie came out in the same year that the remake of TCM was released. Movie monster and make-up genius Stan Winston produced this movie and for the life of me I don't know why. There is nothing original about this movie, the mountain men are poor excuses for 'monsters,' the actors, with the exception of Dushku, were bottom of the barrel, obviously collecting a paycheck and getting experience.I have a warm spot for Eliza, she was in one of my favorite TV shows, Buffy The Vampire Slayer, plus she was in a movie with Arnold (that's Schwarzenegger) and she does have some skill. But this was just the wrong movie for her to be in, plus lets face it, she has a beautiful face and a hot body with some athletic skill and that is why she was cast in this movie. Hopefully she will get something better in the future.Director Rob Schmidt was completely over his head in the direction. The lighting was often off and he over-used every scare tactic that was beaten to death by the endless supply of Friday the 13th movies. Since he has done nothing since, lets hope he is a car salesman in Minot, North Dakota.Nothing much more to say, avoid this movie at all costs. I have watched Disney movies that were more thrilling and Jane Austin movies with more suspense. The DVD is even boring and the commentary is so bad, it seemed that the actors and director were bored also. Note to DVD makers, when doing commentary for movies, don't have large gaps of silence in the commentary, it makes bad movies even worse when you can't here it. To punish myself for renting this, I am going to get circumcised by a blind doctor who is shell shocked while playing the 1812 overture in his ear. **This review and others can be read at www.bbmc.dockratent.com**",Wrong Turn
230,Philbs13,Definitely Some Good Horror,8,30 May 2003,"When I first heard about this movie I thought it was going to be disappointing...which is how I feel going into all horror films in the last decade.  But I was genuinely entertained.  The movie begins similarly to The Final Terror (which is a pretty good backwoods horror movie) but quickly turns into the cliche car broke down - Texas Chainsaw Massacre routine. Fortunately, I have seen so much of this pattern and I still enjoy it. But this film actually generates plenty of suspense and some good edge-of-your-seat survival action.  The characters are your standard idiots in the woods and it's very predictable from the get-go just who will die and who will survive, but the main casting was pretty good, namely Eliza Dushku and Desmond Harrington.  Instead of relying on a single, unkillable Bigfoot type killer, the impact is based on three backwoods, inbred, genetically mutated freaks that have some good prosthetic work done to achieve their grotesque appearance.  There's also a decent amount of gore, mostly implied, but enough to make horror fans smile.  There's also a good number of unsuspected death sequences that I almost started clapping.  The orchestral soundtrack also helps to develop a suspenseful atmosphere.The only draw-back, and I may just be picky, is some base dialogue from the lesser likable characters, some blatant cliche ""jump"" moments, the illogical handling of ""police"" (things just don't happen that way, but I don't want to spoil anything), and the tacked-on cliche extended ending.This film may also remind people of the disappointing Jeepers Creepers, but I must say that this film is notches better and never let's up on the suspense.8/10 worth watching, especially with the few good horror films that have been out lately.",Wrong Turn

243,leereddy,Original? No...Scary? Not really...Fun? Quite a bit actually.,6,17 September 2012,"Wrong Turn is a American horror film directed by Rob Schmidt. The first of numerous installments (and the only one with any familiar faces on board)with three sequels, all of which were direct to DVD releases.The story starts as it means to go on - with young, attractive folk being pointlessly and savagely murdered by some hill billy freaks that appear to have nothing better to do.Then, after the opening title sequence, we meet the films main players - yet more gorgeous types, the first of which is redirected en route to a job interview before accidentally happening upon the other characters. Now this may come as a shock but they too are all brimming with youthful exuberance and one or two of them ain't so rough on the peepers, either.And so, for reasons that will become clear, these sassy young ""kids"" end up stuck in the middle of nowhere, armed with little more than their callow world view and a blatant disregard for the first rule of survival - stay where you are and stay together.Anyway, as is the standard with these capers, they're systematically hunted by psychotic and inexplicably cruel archfiends that seem to derive massive amounts of pleasure from killing puerile, innocent people in the most creatively sick fashion possible.Blah, blah, blah - gory stuff, girls screaming, guys acting brave and unfathomably altruistic, some impressive deaths and all the while an inescapable feeling that Wes Craven saw this and said, ""Hey, you stole my movie, grrr!""Pay no mind to my jaded and somewhat facetious tone, this film is good fun, especially of a Sunday afternoon when nursing a vulgar hangover.

244,jefonline,a couple good actors (out of 6),7,30 March 2008,"Another road trip horror. Everything was pretty good except for the character Carly. I could not stand watching this girl throughout the movie. All she could do was complain and criticize everything, just like a certain friend of mine who just happened to recommend this title to me.The rest of the cast was pretty good, Desmond Harrington and Eliza Dushku, especially, both put forth really solid performances and even helped to make up for some of the movie's shortfalls. Carly's character I thought, was nothing short of brutal. For me, that's what sets some of the other road-trip horrors apart from this. The whiny, sulky brunette did little more than whine and complain and even held the rest back when they were fleeing the cannibals. I either would have changed the script around to eliminate some of her lines or replace the actress altogether. Someone had pointed out to me that they wished Carly was the first to bite the biscuit. I couldn't agree more.There are other movies that this reminds me of due to the nature of the plot (The Hills Have Eyes I and II, The Hitcher, Wolf Creek, and Cabin Fever) The only mistake the director made was with the cannibals laughing so much. It was hard to accept this as a really good horror because the cannibals sounded like a bunch of drunken retards on and off throughout the movie.If they had kept it more serious, it would have made for a better effect. I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a bit of a thrill and get set for some Eliza Dushku. She's another reason why this was easy to watch and it's similar to most other road-trip horrors because it seems that each stars at least one beautiful woman (Dushku, Jessica Stroup in THHE II, Vinessa Shaw in THHE I, Sophia Bush in The Hitcher remake). Even the Texas Chainsaw Massacre had Jessica Biel in the first remake and Jordana Brewster in the follow up.The other strength of Wrong Turn was a solid soudtrack.

This film also didn't have any charisma of it's own.  It was simply a twist of TCM.However, it COULD have been so much more.  The first part of the film, with the 2 rock climbers, should have really set the tone of the movie.  Instead, it was a huge disappointment.  Without getting into specifics, this portion of the film could have been horrifying but took the easy way out with killings off screen that had no scare or shock value whatsoever.  Then, unbelievably, they spell out who the killers are immediately via press clippings during the opening credits.  I don't get it.  Very poorly conceived way of telling a horror story. If you ignore the obvious TCM aspects and simply watch the movie, it is watchable and somewhat enjoyable but highly predictable.  I knew the outcome 10 minutes into the movie, including who would get killed and in what order. I will give the director credit though for having three highly attractive women in the movie, especially the short-haired redhead. 
The ending also leaves a lot to be desired.  These killers are simply brutal and kill their victims on the spot.  However, they simply tie up the final woman instead of killing her in the woods.  Why?  Very strange.  Anyway, I give the movie 4 out of 10 stars.  But only 1 star for horror.  This movie is just not scary.",Wrong Turn

There's the campy dialogue, the over use of gore, the dumb as dirt characters, who each define a certain 'character' within a character in a horror film. There's the man who has that mysterious sexy look, the girl tomboy, the girl who's only got sex on her mind. Then, all hell breaks lose, as they meet up with the inbreeds; 'deranged mountain men' call them if you want. 3 of them in fact, which, through generations of inbreeding have become so disfigured, murder is their only choice to do in life. The fact that they're cannibals is one thing of course, and one (And probably the only) disturbing scene in the film shows a plain filled with nearly 3 to 5 dozen vehicles, implying the number of victims to the ""deranged mountain men"", and just how disturbing they are. The film has some interesting scenes, but overall lacks substance. You'll be reminded of a horror film somewhere throughout it (I'm not naming one, but they are films that will come to mind). And, to top it all off, the film tries to throw a surprise ending that...isn't surprising at all. In fact, I laughed at it. 2003 had much better exceptions for thriller/horror, mainly the gritty ""28 Days Later..."" and the spooky ""Identity"". ""Wrong Turn"", however, is lacking something. Maybe it's lacking originality, maybe it's not. What I know is that it should lack the same old formula other campy horror films have done. By dropping the lame dialogue, ultra-gross gore, and the fact that sex isn't needed for a horror film, it just might've pulled off to a better turn.Final Grades * 1/2 (Out Of Four) D (F Being The Lowest, A+ Being The Best) 2 (Out Of IMDB's Rating Of 10)",Wrong Turn

I have relatives from the mountains and basically if that many people had disappeared in that section of the mountains, somebody would have noticed.( Like the local law enforcement.)There was a virtual junk yard of cars that these ""hillbillies"" had captured.

There aren't a lot of deep character moments or groundbreaking takes on the world around us, but it's an incredibly effective horror film that keeps you engrossed throughout.

255,lmcsharry,Not convinced,5,25 April 2006,"Just a short observation - parts of the film were very good, some good special effects, torture scenarios, the interior with it's paraphernalia, the field full of cars were nice touches. Some of the actors did well, although the gang of 6 was maybe a bit too big for you care all that much about everyone. But, and it's a big but, I thought the villains, the deformed ones, were very poorly put together, very plastic and grotesque without being actually frightening. I wanted a jump like in the reveal of Gary Oldman's face in Hannibal (sorry the name escapes me!). The final chase lost a lot of scare-factor cos I just wasn't afraid of them.

Had this film contained even FIVE minutes of genuine exposition about the bad guys (all we're told is that they're cannibalistic and inbred, and that information is departed begrudgingly)perhaps it would have been marginally tolerable. Except for Eliza Dushku, the acting in this ""film"" was either wooden enough to leave splinters or so all-around bad that I almost found myself wishing the bad guys would hurry up and take out the offenders. I think Eliza Dushku is a decent actress, but her character had no more depth than any of the rest of them. There were a few suspenseful moments that might get the average 13-year-old, but frankly I found this film dismally boring.

I didn't expect much, all you really want from these kinds of movies are some good kills and some good jump scares. We get neither. The opening scene tells you right away that this is a low effort rip off.Our lead is the standard stone-faced tough guy with absolutely no depth to his character. We have 2 stoners who aren't in the film long enough to learn their names. The 2 girls who remain are basically just hot, and one happens to be engaged to our only likable character, played by Jeremy Sisto. He's not incredible, but he's somewhat charming and he was the only character I cared for even a little. He's the only person in the movie who has a little something called a ""personality"". So basically, in our cast of 6 characters, we only get one actual character.The rest of the movie is just predictable schlock. Maybe enjoyable with drunk friends but nothing more. There's one somewhat cool kill, but for the most part their either off screen or incredibly bland. Admittedly I'm somewhat impervious to jump scares, but I would say they would be ineffective to most.So basically if you've been considering giving this a watch but haven't gotten around to it yet, just save yourself the time.",Wrong Turn

263,antonioeku2,"Good ""cannibalistic hillbilly"" throwback flick",7,9 October 2007,"In the 70's, it was nothing to run into a big cannibalistic family while getting lost in the middle of nowhere. They were everywhere. On the way through Texas (Texas Chainsaw Massacre) and even in the desert on the way to California (The Hills Have Eyes). During this time, even though people were aware of this going on they still continued their inbreeding ways. This brings us to present day West Virginia, the setting for one of our latest trips into inbred cannibalistic tribesmen, ""Wrong Turn"".Released at the start of 2003's ""Big Horror Boom"" (and available on DVD October 14) ""Wrong Turn"" kind of came and went seemingly unnoticed. The theaters weren't packed yet the movie developed an early cult following, much like it's early predecessors in which the makers of ""Wrong Turn"" never denied trying to mimic. People liked this movie. I, for one, was one of those people.So how does this flick match up to ""The Hills Have Eyes"" and ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" storyline-wise? On his way through the woods via a detour down an old road Chris Finn's (Desmond Harrington) car is sabotaged by a creatively placed booby trap. Now Chris and a group of teenagers who were wrecked just ahead of him which include Jessie (Eliza Dushku), Carly (Emmanuelle Chriqui), and Scott (Jeremy Sisto) are lost, looking for help, getting more lost, and getting stalked by a group of cannibalistic, wild, deformed inbred mountain men all the while. It doesn't get any better (or old school) than this folks! Some don't make it out of this movie alive as if you couldn't figure that out.The look and feel of the film is great. The mountain men are rather creepy looking and look familiar (I'm from Kentucky). The cast plays their rolls really well for this type of film. Once the movie got intense, it kept that pace throughout much to my surprise. I didn't expect this film to be as fun as it was.A lot of folks didn't give ""Wrong Turn"" a chance when they should have. It was definitely a throwback to 70's cannibal horror and did so tastefully (no pun intended) and stylishly. Often slightly compared to ""House of 1000 Corpses"" due to the whole ""taking a wrong turn in the middle of nowhere"" storyline much like ""Hills"" was to ""TCM"" back in the late 70's. I personally enjoyed ""Wrong Turn"" ten fold over House of 1000 corpses. It never really tried to be a dark comedy (yet there was some small comic relief with the hillbillies) and it was overall a much better experience. If you like 70's stranded-stalked-cannibal horror you shouldn't be disappointed by this ""tribute"" to those flicks.",Wrong Turn
264,NoRoadsLeft,Right Turn for a Wrong Turn (SPOILERS),8,4 March 2006,"I heard from a friend, that it scared the sh*t out of his dad, but I had no idea it would be this good. Sure, there are a few cliché's, but it doesn't go over the top. So - lets go to the story.Chris Flynn, a young medical student, is on his way to a very important meeting, and a chemical spill causes Chris to have to take another road to get to his meeting (hence - Wrong Turn). After being sidetracked from the road, he crashes into another car, that had ran over some barbed wire that got caught in the track. Now, with both cars totaled, the group (now of 6) split up - two staying with the car and the other 4 going to get some help. Soon Enough, the first two people that stayed with the cars are killed (Evan and Francine)two bloody deaths. After, the four remaining characters (Scott, Carly, Chris Flynn, and Jessie) find a cabin, and soon see the grisly and terrifying inbred cannibals. Then, its a race to the finish. If you need the order of who dies and how.... it goes .... 1. Evan - died - unknown 2. Francine - barb wire in mouth 3. Scott - shot in back with arrow 4. Carly - head chopped off Eliza Dushkus character Jessie and Desmond Harringtons character Chris end up surviving the attacks while killing off the cannibals! (or so it may seem) and end off with the riding back in a car on the way home scene.This movie was great. It was creepy, scary, thrilling, exciting, and well made - and kind of pays homage to the older movies.

There are no bad points I can actually think about it, a complete surprise. Also very like Wolf Creek but better.

Wrong Turn has an attractive teen cast (most of whom wind up in pieces), but it plays its horror remarkably straight...and remarkably gory...with heads being chopped in half, arrows going through eyeballs, and teen girls being dissected in front of their crying best friends. The backwoods villains are not given ridiculous backstories or wacky habits....we are not assaulted with stupid music video clips to get us into the heads of the characters....these guys are simply inbred freaks who love to kill.

Her dress up in WT may be simple but still she looked hot and gorgeous with the blue jeans and white tops. She played quite a dismal and gloomy character who had no boyfriend.I like the film for Dushku actually. Without her there is nothing left in the film for me. Emmanulle Chriqi's character was irritating but Desmond Harrington has done a good job. The cannibalistic forest guys are horrific and the toothless (1 existing tooth) old man played a nice cameo.8/10,Wrong Turn

As someone else pointed out in a review, the inbreds are so hideous that they are barely human, yet their house is visible from the road, has stolen cars from their victims parked all over the *front yard*, and I'm guessing never have to venture into a populated area for *anything* (wouldn't they need, at some point, gas, clothes, or even some salt to flavor the people they are eating?). And again, as someone else pointed out, they have gone all these years and nobody ever caught on? Come on. (...And you know, I really hope that this was just a movie, but I have to wonder if people in Hollywood actually think there are inbred people like that running around somewhere? If some other stereotype was exploited like that, people would be up in arms. But I guess it is okay to poke fun at white inbreds who look a little funny???).Another thing that really bugged me is that they somehow have the ability to walk 100 yards through the woods in the tops of trees. I can tell you, if you are lucky you might be able to get from one tree to another tree, but the odds are against you even on that. To be able to walk across ten tree tops like that would be next to impossible.All in all, like I said, a 3/10 but Eliza Dushku's presence bumps it up at least three points to a 6/10.",Wrong Turn

I wasn't -- and still am not -- a HUGE fan of those films, but ""Wrong Turn"" clearly is.  Although the film's tech is clearly SOTA, director Rob Schmidt did a great job of recreating the tension and feel of those older movies.Note that the DVD includes a commentary by the director and two leads (including Eliza Dushku).  I dunno about most people, but I MUCH prefer commentaries with the actors to those without, so this was a big plus for me.  The three began to really enjoy themselves at about the midpoint of the commentary track.  I also enjoyed Rob Schmidt's comments more than I usually do a director's; he did a great job explaining choices he made in areas like cinematography.All in all, ""Wrong Turn"" probably deserves it's current IMDb 5.9 AS A MOVIE. But as a HORROR/SLASHER movie, it deserves slightly higher.  I give it a 7, upped to an 8 if you count the DVD's commentary.",Wrong Turn

I am a huge fan of the horror genre and wanted to give it a shot.  WOW- Am I glad I did!  This movie is just what the genre needed!!!  It was dark, scary, and gruesome!! Sure, it isn't hard to tell that it was inspired by movies like TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE... and that's a good thing!!  It's about time Hollywood started TURNing out movies that were inspired by stuff like CHAINSAW instead of SCREAM for a change.  Part of what made it so great is that the writers didn't waste time trying to explain the villains...who they were, where they came from, and why they do the nasty things they do...and this was a smart move, because it was un-necessary to know anyway.  The newspaper clippings of ""Mountain Men"" at the beginning of the film (while the opening credits kicked in) was just the ticket!  It was perfect.  It gave us a little idea of what we were dealing with and not much more... And then when we finally do get to see the Mountain Men (this movie's killer villains), it is only when something VERY SUSPENSEFUL is happening...or something SCARY...or something Gruesome! It keeps them darker and scarier. Two Thumbs up for this pleasant surprise!  I hope people hear the word about this movie and give it a peek!

It is basically a chase movie (I suppose most horror movies are) in which six which quickly turns to four good-looking young people are stalked by some SERIOUSLY deformed backwoods cannibals. It's funny how killers never go after the ugly people in these kinds of movies. Of course, ugly people are never in these kinds of movies, but I digress. So the young people are running for their very lives and you actually want them to make it because besides being cute they are all nice and reasonably smart, but alas, that is never the way it goes. But before they meet their maker they are chased in the woods in the daytime, then in the nighttime, then in the daytime again. Never could get out of them dern woods. Then the movie is over and you can get out from under your seat.I don't know why they made so many references to West Virginia. There are woods in most every state so the state could have been left unnamed. Then the West Virginians wouldn't be so mad. If I lived in West Virginia I'd be mad too. ***SPOILERS ARE COMING UP***
I only gave this movie six out of ten stars because they killed off Jeremy Sisto's character way, way too early. Everyone in the cast was good but Jeremy Sisto rocks. Also this movie made the police look like morons. You hear that there is a killer in the woods knocking people off and you don't bring back up? Or even a partner?? On two separate occasions??

312,captaincats,Poor Horror film with bad makeup and unbelievable plot holes.,1,12 January 2015,"SPOILER ALERTS**** Where to begin... you know you're in trouble when the creatures (mutant hillbillies in this case) are hid from your sight for most of the film's first hour. In a film clocking in at 84 minutes including credits that can't be good. What few shots you get of the monsters are fast, usually moving shots with no lingering of the camera on what appears to be very poor creature makeup effects. The mutant hillbillies almost look to be wearing rubber masks and bad hair wigs from the local secondhand store's Halloween costume isle. There are some major flaws in the teenage victims' character definitions specifically a lack of any depth or background of real note. The acting is pedestrian and given the script all that is needed. Just some teens on a camping weekend and a lost college med student meeting cannibal, mutant hillbillies that grunt more than talk. A major flaw is the young people's behaviour - when one of the teens gets killed the rest stand around waiting for their turn, they're awful slow to react for teenagers or 20 somethings. Most people would run like hell given some crazies want to eat them.The ending is totally unbelievable with the mutants refusing to die even though one gets run over by a speeding truck through a cabin door and blown up (at the end); another gets gutted - an arrow through the head and finally blown up (at the end); and the third falls 30 feet out of a tree - shows up later to get a severe axe wound to the chest area and survives the final massive explosion (with presumably no chest injury) to presumably kill in a future Wrong Turn movie sequel to come. There's no killing these 'hick' monsters - like some endless stupid nightmare void of reason and having no sense of cause and effect. That's Wrong Turn's biggest defect, lack of intelligent plot or characterization.If you like your horror movies on pilot control with no imagination, no thinking required and lame characters with little oomph, then this dud is for you. On the plus side, there are a few gruesome kills and some gross imagery that is horrific when you think about it but overall the acting is lame and the story unimaginative. Kind of like a Z grade ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" wannabe that is sorely wanting in the wannabe department. That's the worst kind of Z grade film. I give it 1 star out of 10. That star goes to the 2 or 3 gory kills/images. Don't pay to see this turkey or to rent it. Save your money for better movies.",Wrong Turn

They are soon hunted down in a predictable fashion by cannibalistic, uber ugly inbreds. (Which is a very bad joke pointed at West Virginia) In every new scene, one young adult is going to die. However, the scenes are fresh. Sure, we've seen a lot of sadistic houses in our movie going lives, but the way the house scene unravels is grade A. What we haven't seen is the junkyard, which shows just how many people have been killed, the watch tower and the tree tops.I would have given this movie a 10 out of 10 for sheer slasher relief, but the last 15 seconds of the movie (which come after a few credits role) was so cliché that I had to knock it down 3 whole points.And as an ""oh by the way"" the three women were absolutely gorgeous.",Wrong Turn

It was actually one of the more better horror movies I have seen in a long time.       People being stalked in the woods like in Friday The 13th, & being chased by absolute reclusive freaks like those of the characters in Texas Chainsaw Massacre, made this movie quite thrilling & kept it going with out being repetative.

And lastly, going on a trip into the woods, & coming across some less than human individuals had this movie being more scary than I had imagined.  Although slightly synonomous with these past films, it still managed to keep a certain element of originality and a great deal of horror.

I asked her what it was about, and she said, ""I can't remember, but it's got crazy mutated hillbillies."" I thought to myself, ""Hmm... that sounds a lot like The Hills Have Eyes."" Boy, was I wrong. This movie isn't a lot like The Hills Have Eyes- it's the exact same movie.Er, well, it takes place in a forest. But aside from that, it's the same movie. It's got the main character(s) looking for a shortcut through the wilderness, the crazy gas station attendant who somehow lets the main character(s) know about a non-existent shortcut, the tires blow out, the crazy hillbillies kill people, steal their cars, and eat them. That's really the whole movie, and that's all there was to The Hills Have Eyes. (The original, AND the remake.) And I have to say the worst part is watching the interviews with the director and cast and hear them talk about how original it was, and the director even mentions, ""It's a mix between Deliverance and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre."" I guess it sort of would have thrown everyone off if he instead said, ""It's really the exact same movie someone made twenty years ago, and will remake in a couple years, but it takes place in a forest.

The thing I liked about it was it didn't try to be anything it wasn't. There were no twists, no famous actors. It was what you expect of this type of horror movie, but my god they did it well. It was properly tense and the demons weren't ruined when you saw them like in that film Creep. There were some really well made, well produced scenes. The props were good, with all the old trucks and murder weapons serving their purpose as creepy. The acting wasn't great but sometimes it isn't important and this was one of those occasions. So what if the film wasn't particularly well made or acted. It's great fun to watch and it is frightening.

I liked it, refreshing.On the downside is the plot itself. Minor issues that I can forgive but it would've have taken some small changes to make it more convincing.*** SPOILER **** The huge amount of cars parked in the open! Why! That would surely be spotted from the air, esp. when there must be 100s of missing persons. How hard would it have been to just have them in the forest? And what about all the missing persons?

I watched this movie on cable, so I can imagine how it would look on the big screen. The first 20 minutes of the film are so gripping that you'd wanna hold back even the loudest call of nature.Rob Schmidt and Alan B. McElroy have done brilliant jobs as Director and Writer, respectively. Considering the fact that it's an Indie film - the production value isn't very high, and you have Eliza Dushku (she is HOT!) hamming like a ham burger, and Desmond Harrington having mainly one expression on his face - Schmidt yet has pulled it off so well, that I could easily say this is one of the finer thrillers/horror flicks made in recent times. The Editor too has contributed so well in maintaining the tempo and 'tightness' of the scenes.The best test - they say - of a scary film is to watch it without sound; if it is as scary or even a little lesser, then it genuinely is a very good piece of direction. Most horror films or thrillers rely heavily on sound effects for creating that moment of thrill. So I tried out this test - muted the TV and watched the 'scary parts'.

We also went to Identity just before seeing that, and for me the twist at the end really stole all the tension and excitement away.  Due to this I was up for a good slasher and that's what I got.  I had heard that it was based on The Hills Have Eyes so I wasn't too hopeful when I went in, as I thought the only good thing about that film was when the dog heroically saved the day.  I was very pleasantly suprised though.  The action started immediately which is what you want when you go to see a slasher, and from the time the four of them got to the house the action barely stopped.  They had just the perfect amount of cliches: the drugs and sex followed by gory death, the not killing them when it really would have been wise to, and that stupid girl bothering everyone!  But for all this expected and fun stuff I think they did manage to be somewhat original with the positions the characters were placed in.  The watch tower was fun (though again you had to know what was coming), and the bit in the house also.  I like a good predictable slasher and that's what this was.

But I watched all that the DVD had to offer,including watching the movie with the commentary and English subtitles on. The man who made the movie was indeed tired of movies like ""Scream"" and ""Scary Movie"", where the audience is no longer able to know what is meant to be funny and what is meant to be scary. This includes the ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"" movies. So he set out to do his spin on movies that scared him, or rather impressed him, from the 1970's. I.e., ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" and ""Cannibal Holocaust"". He combined elements from those two to make ""Wrong Turn"". Hence it is no wonder if it reminds people of movies from that decade. It was intended too. Plus, by the way. It was not only made with mechanical and optical special effects, it was also made with CGI special effects. That you can't tell the difference casually, unless you just happen to be an expert in the field, is a great tribute to the special effects artists and technicians. The cannibals themselves, were inspired by the same ones seen in the ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" remake, in that those were based on real people from the 1970's. Inbred mutants.",Wrong Turn

This movie is very special for me because it did stand out from all the crap that appeared in the 2000'nds. The main characters are actually lovable(most of them at least)and I found myself caring A lot for every one of them. The visuals are pretty good but, the sound design is awesome and the ""Creatures"" or cannibals are really frightening. My personal favourite would be three finger.

So I did, which turned out to be one of the biggest mistakes I've done back then. The movie was and still is one of the biggest craps I've ever seen. Even for a slasher, a b-movie, or whatever it is, is this movie to bad, really bad.The first thing, the runtime. It says 84 minutes . . . yeah if you want to read the credits then you will spend 84 minutes in front of your TV, but without it the movie is only 78 or 79 minutes long ( it's been a while since I saw it ). A movie that is 79 minutes long isn't a movie, it's just a longer episode, maybe like a two episodes of Outer Limits or Twilight Zone, but it's not enough to show a movie.Some people die in the beginning, the first 10 minutes, and the rest of the bunch others runs thought the movie, injured and half death, until some others get killed in the last 10 minutes. This one guy, is really injured and he's losing blood, but hell, yeah he can run, hide, climb and do some stunts even Superman couldn't do. Losing blood and still be able to do such things is a bit, confusing.The girls. Why are girls half naked in such movies. Half naked, with cuts and bruises, wearing small tops that are dirty and bloody. Do people want to please some perverts dirty little fantasies about dirty girls running away from in-breed monsters that can't die . . . ooh yes and all that half naked. Yes, sex sells, but it's not a guarantee for success.O.K. the scenes where those cannibals kill some of the kids, cut off some body parts, hands, heads, etc. are cool, bloody, and really O.K. for a horror"" . . . but the rest. Oh yes, the sick human-eating-weirdos look like Quasimodo on speed, making sounds like a mixture of some wanna be Klingon's and Wookiee's.I give this movie a 2, because of the eeeeeeeerrrrrhhhhhmmm"" scenes in the movies, the ones that are predictable and a bit overdone, and those nice bloody cut scenes, but besides that there is no fun at all when watching this movie.",Wrong Turn

Have them stumble across a house of horrors (Texas Chainsaw Massacre) and you have the heart pounding! On first glance you think - great another Screamesque tribute but this one will have you sitting on the side of your chair yelling to the actors - 'WATCH OUT!' Take some extremely gory death sequences to rival Savini and a very interesting chase scene high up in the tree tops and you have a fantastic horror flick!

In the press before this film was released the creators had described it as a throwback to 70's and 80's style horror, that is exactly what this thing was. This film could have easily been released 15 years ago and fit right in with all the other horror films of that time. I will admit, the plot in this one is pretty standard and it's not too tough to figure out which characters are going to survive but for me the fun was remembering a time in movies when all you cared about was how the characters were going to die, not how they survived.",Wrong Turn
333,Hitch-11,Quite possibly the worst movie of the year...,1,31 May 2003,"I love cheesy slasher flicks. I grew up on them. Give me Re-Animator, Return of the Living Dead...even Jason X. For a horror fan, when a movie like 'Wrong Turn' is released, I have to be there regardless of what I fear is going to happen. I heard it was 'Hills Have Eyes' meets 'Texas Chainsaw Massacre' meets 'Jeepers Creepers'...all great films. What you end up getting is 'Gnome Named Gnorm' (check out Stan Winston's film credits..he actually made this) meets Surviving the Game meets 'The Muppets'. My fears came to life as 'Wrong Turn' didn't. Director Rob Schmidt does not know how to create tension/suspense/horror/ or even general interest. This movie, if I dare refer to it as that, is a complete joke that doesn't intend to be funny. It gives slasher movies of the past a horrible reputation and reveals just how terrible the future of acting really is when we're subjected to watch Eliza Kushdu and Desmond Harrington attempt to carry a film whereupon dropping it in a steaming pile of crap. What does it say about your movie when laughable-cannibal-mutant-muppets become smarter than the human characters of the story? It says everything about 'Wrong Turn'. I hated, hated, hated this movie. The only thing that made the experience mildly enjoyable was doing the Mystery Science Theater thing throughout and listening to other people laugh at how bad this movie is.

334,mugwump,"Title aptly describes pathetic, boring mess.",2,1 June 2003,"This new addition to the grotesque family antics sub-genre, this clumsy, in-bred child of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, is even worst than you could expect. First off, we're greeted with somewhat of an un-exciting, clichéd opening scene featuring an unexpectedly weak female character, her stronger yet stupider male counterpart and an unseen beast or killer. As of now, the mystery surrounding the killer's identity is preserved and, despite this sorry-looking scene, we still are left wondering about what exactly happened and as long as it is true, we can't say that this opening scene is totally worthless.Then the credits roll and subsequently kill the whole following film. I was amazed by how ridiculous it was to actually reveal the identity, origins and specific problems of the killer before we could even start to venture into the woods and ask ourselves. If this isn't bad filmmaking, I don't know what is... The succession of gloomy newspaper articles and textbook exemples of totally unrealistic diseases was downright pathetic, a sorry, and clumsy, attempt at shocking either the youngest or less discriminating members of the audience. It's hard for me to understand that it's not everybody that was completely turned off by the opening credits.Anyway, if you weren't already out of the movie theater, you could have encountered some of the most boring and worthless characters ever to grace a theatrical release. Everything from the music they listen to, their interactions with other characters to their attitudes and actions is bland and tiresome. Those youngsters are not even charismatic or attractive (I mean, it takes much more than wearing a tank top to be attractive...). Anyway, you certainly wouldn't want to go there for the characters...Then, you must consider the initial accident that causes the characters to meet each other and all the subsequent situations. That accident is total bullshit to begin with. Are we actually expected to believe that one second with the eyes off the road could make this conscientious driver miss a half-a-ton truck in the middle of the road? That's exactly the kind of worthless narrative impossibilities that shamelessly robs the horror genre of all of its credibility. After that, we venture more and more into the world of formulaic and systematic horror with clichéd sets and situations much of which are underdeveloped and underplayed. Some boring, predictable, badly handled material.The most outraging problem of this movie does not however concern plot devices, acting or directing but rather its total lack of social justice. Examples of this are numerous. Why is it, first of all, that it is the stoners having sex that get killed off first and in the most brutal way? Stoners are expandable crap : is that it? Maybe it is sex before marriage that is to blame... hum... confusing but nonetheless primordial question, isn't it? What kind of a society would encourage the systematic slaughter of these particular individuals? Not a very liberal one, if you ask me... Then, of course, our hero is the highly valued medical student but that's comprised within the same scheme of thoughts... On to my next point : how is it morally acceptable for the protagonists to kill off the mutants? Why should we cheer for them as they try to burn them down? Why is it okay for our lead girl to shoot an arrow in the back of the mutant's head in a voluntary act of hatred while it is despicable for our mutant to kill off a guy in a psychosis-driven act of natural hunting? Why should we root for the hateful 'normal' ones and not the mis-understood 'freakish' ones? Talk about equity of all people...In conclusion, I understand that you might think that it is irrelevant to get p***ed at such an unsignificant film but I don't agree. I think that horror and sci-fi flicks are really the ones that reflect our society's way of thinking and that's why it's such a good place to begin wondering about it all. I also think that it is our right as paying moviegoers to expect a certain level of quality when attending the release of a big-budgeted 35 mm film. I think that it is despicable to see so little work actually put in making this movie as there was initial material capable of generating genuine feelings or at least, shocks. This movie should never have been released in that state... never.  I know guys that can make more professionnal-looking movies within a week and with a budget of 0 $! 'Wrong Turn' is an insult to both our intelligence and our right to demand social equity. I sincerely hope that the people responsible for this and other past and upcoming atrocities of this ilk will learn some lessons about life and filmmaking from awakened moviegoers that will not accept this kind of crap anymore.My Rating : 2/10",Wrong Turn

This movie was enjoyable because it brings back the days of gore ie. Texas chainsaw massacre, which it will most likely be compared to the most.  There was no need for a big convoluted plot, they left you enough information to figure out why everything happened, there was non stop action, some likeable heros and some that the audience in my showing cheered for when they died.  The villains were vile and unlikeable and yet almost comical at times.

An also very obvious move is that they split up to look for help, Francine and Evan are left behind to look after the cars while Chris, Jessie, Carly and Scott go of into the woods to look for a phone, But what they don't know is that a group of Deformed Cannibals are lurking in the shadows around them.The film itself for me was O.K but didn't really excite me and a lot of the characters were VERY annoying and i was thankful that 4 out of 6 of them were killed. I didn't really have a best bit of the film but if i had to choose it would be when Carly(Emmanuelle Chriqui) was axed straight through the mouth into a tree for the simple fact that she was crying and moaning all throughout the film. The violence wasn't disappointing but in a few parts were not very realistic, my favourite death scene had to be when Francine (Lindy Booth) had barbed wire pulled round her mouth cutting down her cheeks because it was one of the most realistic and because she and her boyfriend were having sex in the woods...

Ahh.. the hillbillies.  Growing up in South Texas must have desensitized me to them or something, but none of them frightened me in the slightest. I've had scarier hillbillies for NEIGHBORS.

351,Timescrew,A mediocre movie.,5,11 January 2004,"What do you get if cross The Blair Witch Project with The Texas Chainsaw Massacre? Well, you get Wrong Turn of course. I tried hard to find something about the movie that I enjoyed, but found the well nearly dry. It is a simple movie, having a simple 70's horror flick plot. They came, they were slaughtered, and two made it out alive to tell the tale. If you are looking for a no-nonsense teen death flick reminiscent of Friday the 13th, then this is the right movie for you. Sadly, I require more from a movie, no matter how one lane the plot is. The acting was on par for this type of movie, with an adequate performance by lead stars Harrington (Chris) and Dushku (Jessie). I did not expect much from them, taking in the concept of the film, but they performed well. The issue I had a problem with was character depth, especially in the case of Jessie.Dushku plays the part well, but seems to be just reprising the role of Faith from the popular TV Series `Buffy: The Vampire Series' and its successful spin off `Angel.' She is crass, takes no bull, and is every bit the athlete. That is all we seem to know about her though. This disappoints me, because I expect to see a character that is more thought out. Perhaps this is all that there should be to the character, as survival becomes her main goal very early in the film. One thing I have noted through Dushku's film history is that she plays a survivor very well. One good thing about this movie is that there are no gratuitous sex scenes! This is far from the usual genre. The cast is small too, like most horror flicks, but the women are not portrayed as sex crazed teases like in most horror/teen thriller movies. Another interesting point in reference to sexuality: even though three of the four females in this movie are wearing low cut or top open shirts/halters, Dushku keeps her breast in check. Perhaps this was the actor's personal choice, or a smart move by the director, but Dushku manages to jump, run, drop, roll and all sorts of other maneuvers without showing an inch of cleavage or even a bra strap. Now, this may sound like I'm a pervert, but again I mentioned it only because most movies of this type make their sales based on the amount of skin the leading girl shows. (SPOILERS BELOW - BEWARE) A couple of points that seemed to sway this movie aside from believability: If I were a lone disfigured inbred psycho living in the woods with two others just like me, I think I would at least try to take advantage of some of the eye-candy that was made available. How else do they reproduce? Oh yeah, inbreeding. Still alone in the woods all that time and all you can think to do is chop her up and eat her? Yeah Here is another: Where did Jessie learn to shoot a bow? It is not as easy as it looks, believe me. But not only does she save the day by plucking one of the bad guys, but she holds the bow horizontally in the act. It is actually harder to shoot the bow this way. However, this goes back to the whole character development I was mentioning earlier. Overall, I liked the acting, I liked the plot and I liked the cinematography. Nevertheless, the directing, storyline, and characters pretty much stank. Rating: 5/10",Wrong Turn

Things soon go from bad to worse as they are being stalked by cannibalistic mountain men grossly disfigured through generations of in-breeding. It soon turns into a cat & mouse game of survival...Wrong Turn harks back to the 1970's and is a cross between Drive-In Horror classics ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" and ""The Hills Have Eyes"" with a drop of ""Deliverance"" thrown in for good measure. The grossly disfigured rednecks look suitably gruesome as you would expect with the make-up effects being overseen by the maestro Stan Winston. Wrong Turn moves along at a decent pace and once the fun and games begin never really lets up until the final credits roll. The characters are pretty two dimensional and while Desmond Harringtons hero lacks charisma Eliza Dushku as ""Jessie"" the gutsy heroine and Jeremy Sisto As ""Scott"" fair better and manage to give their characters a little personality. Wrong Turn isn't a classic by a long way but it does boast some effective scares and doesn't back away from showing a bit of blood and guts when the story allows...OK so the film wears its influences like badges of honour but thats what makes this homage to 1970's horror cinema work.",Wrong Turn

Stan Winston's first, and to many avid fans his most memorable creation were the Gargoyles, and during this era Stan created many other amazing freaks, but I shall skip less recognizable work to works of brilliance which many readers of this review will be sure to recall with complete, and utter admiration of Stan's work. OK, let me start by introducing the robot in the movie Terminator (need I remind the reader how original the robot was at the time?) The next unbelievable, and also my favourite was the extraordinary Alien in the movie Predator - once again the same question applies. Stan went on the create many, many other unforgettable creatures in movies galore; T2, Jurassic Park, The Relic, Edward Scissorhands, AI, and before I start writing Stan's biography, let me share my views about Wrong Turn. From the opening scene of the desperate hiker to the very end, WR is like the line on a graphic equalizer - with high peaks, low's, and off-course a balance. One can argue the balance is sometimes very predictable, unoriginal, lacks suspense, but on the other hand the high's lift the low's to balance out the movie into eighty something minutes of a stable, entertaining horror flick. Not to mention the performances of the leading actors - Eliza Dushku, who plays a strong minded, strong willed, HOT BABE, who after being dumped by her x, travels with her friends into the wilderness upon where they meet Chris Flynn (Desmond Harrington) And, oh boy the meeting isn't your standard office meeting.The next twenty or so minutes concentrates on introduction of the characters, and off-course a brief glimpse of the ever so frightening trio of physically retarded maniacs. Again, this sequence of events is predictable, but the bear trap scene is quite the opposite. Now, the most interesting part of the movie, where the equalizer level is set at high happens when the four unsuspecting adventures stumble across a cabin, and decide to enter in hope of finding a phone. Each of the four travels into various rooms with each individual discovering unique objects, when all of a sudden they hear the roaring engine of a tow truck approaching the house. When they rush across to see what the drama is, they see the tow truck and catch a glimpse of the trio. Panic sinks in striking the cords on each persons own fear. The four are un-able to escape, opting to hide in pairs in two parts of the house. This is what I was talking about before - can you imagine seeing your own sister being mutilated by three freaks of nature, while you're stuck underneath the safest place in the house? I'll allow the people who have yet watched the movie to thoroughly enjoy this sequence of events by moving right along to the scene leading up to the end, which is in my view almost as terrifying as the house scene, but with a little more gore, and spice added to the mix. In this scene the remaining male comes across a police officer, who happened to be the person listening to the distress call made the night before - all seems to be finally about to end, but instead while Chris tries explaining the situation, an arrow comes blazing past Chris striking the officer. Once again this particular killing of the police officer is almost an exact replica of Friday the 13th 4, when Jason uses a spear gun exterminating the victim in one crucial blow to the eye. I purposely left out scenes where originality conquered the setting. I'm sure all horror fans realized why. Rating 7/10",Wrong Turn

You expect to see the same thing over and over again where only a few of them make it out alive but everyone else dies kind of thing. This movie was seen in theaters after my friend begged me to go because she is a big Eliza Dushku fan, so I went. I believe that after watching this movie that it was worth all the while with the gritty horror scenes, a lot of blood, and enough running around. The acting was well enough for the type of genre the film was but don't expect an Oscar nominee for this!I guess I am the kind of person who likes to be scared out of their mind and there has not been a scary movie that has done it yet.

There seems to be an endless stream of bad movies that were never seen in a theater that star next-to-nobody actors and offer nothing by way of plot, directing or originality. Cable offers a wasteland of movies made by a industry that would rather pump out an assembly line of mediocre ""safe bet"" movies or ""skin flicks"" then take a chance on something new and original. (Did you know there was a sequel to Starship Troopers? Of course you didn't, no one did, it's horrible don't bother.) That being said, I really enjoyed stumbling on to Wrong Turn. As a fan of Texas Chainsaw Massacre I'm always down with watching in-bred freaks hunt down teens and this film continues that tradition with some new twists. The acting is good enough for this type of movie; anybody expecting more must not be familiar with the genre. Go watch Silence of the Lambs if you want a cerebral psychological thriller. This film offers some unique thrills in the slasher dept., creative camera work and some freaky characters who's faces, like the masked Jason, are obscured from us so as to let our imaginations do the scaring. If you're doing a late night slasher or fright festival, this movie will fit in nicely.",Wrong Turn

Of course there are killers, conveniently retarded, mutated, and inbred killers. Pretty funny how these killers are unbelievably hideous just because they are inbred. Everyone knows if you scrogg your mom, your kids going to be pretty deformed, but really come on. After watching the film you'll see that it's all too familiar to pretty much every horror movie on the market. I wouldn't recommend unless you want to appreciate other movies more.

It has some awesome death scenes maybe inspired by Friday the 13th or other slasher movies back in the day. This is the kind of movie that I want to see more of today. It seems like a lot of today's horror movies are supernatural. I like real, straight-up horror. It has a lot of parallels to The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Some of the suspense in this movie is almost unbearable.The acting is so-so with Eliza Dushku as the main character. I think she does a great job in this movie, and I think she'll be a good actress in the years to come. Desmond Harrington also does a heck of a job as well.The make-up and special effects are terrific. Those mountain men look as real as can be. Each one has their own physic and personality. Every death scene in this movie is memorable and creative.If you love classic slasher horror movies, then rent this with no questions asked.

VA. then I suppose I might be scared.  But watching a horror movie in a movie theater or in the comfort of my own home just doesn't do it for me.

366,uhavfoundsll,Wrong Turn: Only for horror fans to enjoy.,7,30 May 2003,"Well I just got back from seeing Wrong Turn tonight and I must say I was surprised about this film. With no theatre trailers shown because the MPAA thought the 3 trailers were too intense and for only advertising this film as some sort of ""I know what you did last summer crap fest"" it's amazing this film is even being distributed as large as it is.
However this film delivers, however it only delivers for true horror films who can appreciate what makes a good horror film. Now this film is far from perfect and it has it's problems which happens early on in the film, but when the **** hits the fan things get going and it's a non-stop fight for your life horror film. The film pays homage to Texas Chainsaw Massacre, and you can see a bit of Friday the 13th somewhat, as well as a backdrop atmosphere of Pumpkin Head. This film takes place in the deep dense woods of West Virginia with the typical storyline of 6 college kids stranded out in the middle of no where. There are some shocking scenes in the film which makes the movie worth seeing for horror fans but I'm not going to tell you where they are. You will know it when you see it.Like Texas Chainsaw Massacre this film makes you believe that this could actually happen in real life. The cannibals in this film are ugly and nasty and I couldn't imagine the smell they gave off if I were there. These cannibals are good at what they do and the films shows this beautifully when our college kids come upon their home and later their back yard if you want to call it that.The acting and dialogue is okay and has some cheesy stupid stuff throughout the story but horror films aren't really known for these depts so it doesn't matter. I felt the film held back in a few places but in the end it didn't matter. I enjoyed it and the film doesn't get boring at all. This film is gory in some scenes and there is a few intense scenes which will make you want to look the other way some what but hey it's a horror film.
So in closing my hats off to Stan Winston for creating these designs of the Cannibals and they are terrifying and they are the last thing you would want to meet out in the woods or anywhere for that matter. However I couldn't help but laugh when I heard these things yell and scream or try to talk. So horror fans go and see it. Everyone else it's 50/50. If you don't like horror films then don't waste your time. It's not the best horror film but it certainly does deserve to be seen. 7 out of 10.",Wrong Turn

Alright lets start off the cast is nice they're good looking and they seem really real like the couple in love which is sweet. The acting is nice too but not as good as the deaths which in that time are creative like the girl who's life is cut short with the barb wire. The deaths you can say are gory.

371,sweetleafnib,Wrong Turn,7,11 August 2019,"For what it is, Wrong Turn isn't bad. Much like Saw, this horror film spawned many of sequels, most of which are discredited. Not a whole lot to say about this one but let's get started. Wrong Turn is a lost survivors story where they try to find civilization. The characters are lost in the wilderness, and each one of them is picked off by a group of unknown assailants. It's a simple story, bearing resemblance to films such as The Texas Chainsaw Massacre and The Hills Have Eyes. The main girl, Jessie (Eliza Dushku) is a strong, brave main girl, and characters such as Scott (Jeremy Sisto, he will be in the next review) and Chris (Desmond Harrington) are good enough characters where they don't make you want to punch your TV screen. The mutants are effective in the sense that they're scary beings, and when they chase the characters is suspenseful. The watchtower scene was easily my favorite scene. I loved watching the characters figure out how to escape. The setting is okay, it's the typical forrest scene in most slashers, nothing too special. The gore is surprisingly well done and the kills are varied and special. Overall, it's a simple yet fun horror film to watch, check it out when you're not sure what to watch.

Jeremy Sisto is likable, as usual, with his nice-guy, wise cracker role that he plays well.If any movie, out of the long list of movies that are influenced by TCM and THHE, should be looked at with a smile and a nod that says..""yup, the person who came up with this is an unadulterated horror fan""..this is the one.Not amazing, but some healthy horror-some fun.",Wrong Turn

They then make a mad dash for their lives through out the woods, only hoping to make it out alive.",Wrong Turn
376,OttoBones,Coming soon to home video - Wrong Turn 2 and Wrong Turn 3,6,31 May 2003,"This film probably should have been a straight-to-video release, but thanks to the box office draw of Eliza Dushku, it has found its way onto the big screen.  I enjoyed this movie.  The plot was, of course, ludicrous.  There are crazy, deformed, inbred mountain men in the woods of Virginia that lie in wait for those gullible city folk to wander aimlessly into the woods, so that for reasons unknown, they can kidnap them and cut off their various body parts.  And these crazy mountain men also have super human strength which allow them to survive time and again so their reign of terror can continue throughout the film and hopefully for many sequels to come.The reason I liked this film was because I thought it was pulled off well. The filmmakers get right to the point.  There ain't a whole lot of character development, so the senseless killing can begin.  The frights are genuine. I found myself clenching the armrests at the theater at times, hoping for the narrow escapes of our heroes.  And the bad guys were sufficiently creepy, with reasonably realistic make-up and believable portrayals of crazy inbreds. The other actors did a pretty good job as well.  I thought Desmond Harrington was a great lead.  He has a very strong and serious presence. Not like a B-movie actor at all.  In fact, all of the actors did fairly well.  Jeremy Sisto's dry performance as the newly-engaged Scott was terrific.  Emmanelle Chriqui plays that character that all horror movies have, the whiny one who keeps holding up the group while they try to run. But she does it well.  I didn't find myself wanting her to die.  Eliza Dushku was not as convincing to me.  She starts out playing the strong character that she plays so well in 'Bring it On,' but when she starts to show her 'feminine' side, it doesn't seem natural for her.Overall, if you've got a whole lot of time to waste, and you like horror films, check this one out at the theater.  Otherwise, it's a renter, but if you wait a few years, three at most, you might be able to rent the whole trilogy.  My grade - C",Wrong Turn

Thankfully, what i discovered was notably more enjoyable.Yes, it is true to say that it does follow along the same vein as many other horror movies in that many key aspects of it are quiet predictable. However, in spite of this, a distinct empathy can be felt for the majority of the protagonists, who you really don't want to fail victim to the insane, murderous, mountain psychos. Not alone this, but I feel that it is safe to proclaim, as i'm sure have and will many others, that the atmosphere is one of well created nail biting tension, which lasts throughout the duration of the film.In fact, I found the atmosphere that the movie exuded to be so compelling that I failed to notice certain flaws that would normally aggravate me in a film. I of course will refrain from elaborating on these details so as not to spoil the viewing for those who have yet to see it.What I really liked about this film was that it didn't try what so many other horror movies as of the last seven years or so haave tried- and that is to be ironic. It is just a horror movie, with the distinct and generally successful aim of scaring and entertaining. Its atmosphere undeniably achieves this, however its not alone, it is true to say that this film is not for the squeamish. Several scenes prove to be quite graphic.In this respect, I would have to admit that Wrong Turn doesn't have the makings of changing the world of movies as we know it, but it does however, have the capacity to push you to the edge of your seat.

But I did nearly jump out of my seat a few times.Eliza Dushku is fantastic as Jessie and the rest of the cast did a great job.Overall, I really enjoyed Wrong Turn. It's incredibly fast paced.  The performances were good.  If you like horror movies, it's well worth seeing.",Wrong Turn

When i first seen the previews of this movie on T.V and i said to myself ( Oh just another SCREAM or I Know What you DID LAST SUMMER movie )... Personally before i seen this movie i was getting pretty sick of seeing so called horror movies with a stupid PG-14 rating beside it.. Then out of know where comes this Movie Director with some B*LLS. Now i'm a huge fan of good old 70's horror flicks, but i have not been able to see any of them at a theater cause of my age.  But after last Friday i finally got that chance. I found it quite interesting to sit in a theatre with lots of other people witnessing the same thing as me.  About the movie itself, i started noticing resemblance of THE HILLS HAVE EYES, and The TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE, which got me more into the movie.  I don't want to reveal anything about the movie, but all i can say is ( WOW DID THEY JUST SHOW THAT !!! ) And it just kept going on through the whole movie.

394,KatharineIsabelleFan,"Good Movie, but Uninventive",10,6 December 2003,"LOTS OF SPOILERS!Eliza Dushku, Desmond Harrington, Emmauelle Chriqui, and Jeremy Sisto shine in this film!The story: Jessie (Eliza Dushku), Scott (Jeremy Sisto), Francine (Lindy Booth), Evan (Kevin Zegers), and Carly (Chriqui) blow their tires on barbwire that was left by the three cannibalistic mountain men. Chris Flynn (Harrington) crashes into their SUV on accident and soon he, Carly, Scott, and Jessie are off to look for a road or people, leaving Francine and Evan behind. Evan and Francine look through Chris' car and then Evan is killed offscreen. Francine begins looking for him and finds his ear, ripped off, and then is killed by being garroted with barbwire. Soon after, Jessie, Chris, Scott, and Carly stumble along a cabin and go in, only to be nearly caught by the mountain men bringing Evan and Francine back. Carly and Scott hide in their storage room with Chris and Jessie under a bed. The mountain men bring in Francine, cut her hand and leg off, and eat. They fall asleep. Soon, the group gets out, only to be caught by SawTooth (One of the mountain men) and chased. They find Evan's body in the men's truck. Scott is killed with arrows through his heart later and then eaten. Time passes until Carly is killed with an ax to her mouth and then Jessie is kidnapped, Chris finds a Forest Trooper (who is killed with an arrow through the eye by SawTooth) and then he hides under the truck SawTooth lifts from the trooper. They arrive at the cabin where Jessie is tied up and then they blow the mountain men up. Jessie and Chris drive off to nowhere and then ThreeFinger comes back and kills another trooper.Comments: I love this movie! The actual plot of the film is kinda old, but first-timer Rob Schidmt uses old style 70's-horror-film magic to scare us! Stan Winston also creates grotesque mountain men and they both effectively make inventive deahts (Francine and Carly anyways). They give lots of adrenaline in this great film!

Soon after, lone wolf medical student Chris (Desmond Harrington) accidentally smacks into the back of their 4x4.From then on they are under the threat of being picked off in turn by the locals, who have a taste for city-boy (and girl) flesh.

The bad guys are wonderfully gruesome, I most certainly would not want to meet them in some dark deserted forest some night. There are some good inventive kills with CG kept down to a bare minimum. The acting isn't as dreadful as we've seen in some other horror movies. The two leads, Desmond Harrington and Eliza Dushku play likable characters Chris Flynn and Jessie Burrlingame respectively. Chris is cool under pressure and thinks problems through, which is somewhat refreshing to see in a slasher movie. Jessie isn't the atypical hysterical screaming girl in the usual gore fest, she's athletic, smart, and keeps it together through most of it. There are even 2-3 good jumps in the movie. I liked the tempo of it, they delivered a good mix of scares, then rests to make it a nice little gory scary ride.

I've watched it at least 10 times. Fans of Eliza and Emmanuelle will enjoy this exciting movie. I'm a fan of both these young actresses who are attractive and talented.

403,countspookula,"For what it is, it works.",7,23 May 2015,"The thing about this movie, is that it doesn't try to be something it's not. It doesn't see itself as any better than it is, which is something you have to respect, on some level. Many people dislike this film, and I understand why. But personally, I liked it. It was paced well, and edited brilliantly. The plot is a little paper thin, but it's still good and there never is a boring moment. it constantly keeps you on edge. Compared to a lot of dumb horror films that were released during this era, Wrong Turn very much feels like a trip back to the 70's with it's style. However, that doesn't mean to say that it's a masterpiece. One problem i DO have with this film, is that a lot of these problems could've been solved if the characters had any common sense from the beginning, but no. It bases itself on the characters' mistakes, and I think that's stupid. Go into a creepy cabin in the middle of the deep woods expecting that somehow a PHONE will be in there? Light up a dozen glowsticks in a watchtower to make yourself as visible as possible? Okay.While the characters are alright and somewhat likable, many complain that they're too stupid to even be real. I'm a pushover, but yeah, I get where they're coming from. Sometimes they are too whiny or too bland. They don't have much of a personality. The killers thhemselves are often kept in the shadows, we don't really get much of a good proper look at them, but I like that. Sometimes, it's what we DON'T see that is scary. They're a bit silly, but I guess this situation could really happen. I'd recommend it.",Wrong Turn

In the press before this film was released the creators had described it as a throwback to 70's and 80's style horror, that is exactly what this thing was.  This film could have easily been released 15 years ago and fit right in with all the other horror films of that time.  Now all the studios give us is PG horror with no blood and they think that by using computer effects to create villains that all the kids who come to see their movies will be blown away by the effects and not care about anything else.  Wasn't ""Darkness Falls"" one of the worst movies ever?  It seems to me like that is the only type of movie that studios want to make these days is horror for children.  If you enjoy good quality blood and gore and don't want to think too hard, this is for you.

We perhaps aren't the richest place to live or the busiest tourist attraction but that is no reason to make us look bad.

The police uniform was the wrong color, the trees were not even the correct species, too flat, roads too straight....wish they would do research before just planting a 1-sided insult to our state.

From the very beginning, ""Wrong Turn"" proved to be a suspenseful horror/slasher flick that did not stop till the very end. Not only was there a sufficient amount of gore, but this film also provided enough scares and tense moments that kept me on the edge of my seat for practically the whole film. Set in the woods of West Virginia, (where as the film it was based on ""The Hills Have Eyes"" was set in the desert) ""Wrong Turn"" offers it's audience an intensely creepy vibe and the woods are somewhat reminiscent of ""Deliverance"". The slasher notion of a group of people being chased by knife wielding maniacs was used effectively in this film, and the fact that these maniacs were deformed inbreeds heightened the fear factor for me. 10 out of 10 for ""Wrong Turn"".",Wrong Turn

There are a few chilling moments as well as some originality to the dramatic chase scene (ie. through the trees) , but ultimately I feel this film does not live up to its current rating of 6 as much of the film's horror tactics are predictable and ineffective, not to mention the strong misogynistic tone that I sensed throughout (this is the first horror film, surprisingly, having made me feel that way). This however, is not entirely the case, and as mentioned, there are some creative additions as well as effectively terrorising moments, thus I suggest if you're a horror buff, its worth a watch, but just don't expect any cinematic magic.",Wrong Turn

After walking out of the theater on Friday, I was pleasantly surprised. The reason no one likes this movie is because the plot is simple, but that's not a bad thing. Wrong Turn pays homage back to the good 'ol days like Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Deliverance. The death scenes are also creative and thrilling. Wrong Turn is VERY suspenseful and VERY scary. There are A LOT of pop scares.

446,Fordspeak,Awful movie that represents a much larger problem,1,17 February 2006,"For all of those you wondering how such horrible mine disasters in West Virginia could have happened, this movie clearly represents what the real problem is. West Virginians' lives have absolutely no value in our society. In age of strict political correctness, we still are forced to put up with this nonsense. So let me tell you why this stereotype exists in the first place. Even before WV became a state, absentee ownership was a big deal. As the state was being industrialized, many West Virginians were in a position to benefit off of our natural resources, particularly coal and lumber. However more established companies (particularly in the northeast) began to muscle out our nature entrepreneurs. To add insult to injury, they fabricated the way West Virginians lived the press to justify their actions. For example, take the Hatfields. The feud with the McCoys is really a smokescreen. The typical perception of those uninformed is that this was just an altercation between two hick families. This is not true. The Hatfields were a very astute family (the family patriarch, ""Devil"" Anse Hatfield has a tombstone imported from Italy). Any pictures you see of the Hatfields were all taken at least 15 years after the feud (which itself is misleading) and were all posed. At the time, Hatfield was prominent in the lumber industry in the state. However, his patrons took advantage of this fabrication and called in his loans. So as you can see, the perception of us goes hand in hand with control of our resources.",Wrong Turn

I don't know? But this movie just did not register a blip on the scare-o-meter for me.Like most of the reviewers here, I found myself cheering for the ""bad guys"" and thinking the demise of the ""good guys"" should have come sooner... especially for that clumsy/frantic/I-need-a-good-pistol-whipping Cary character (a big cheer erupted from the cinema audience when she got the axe... so to speak).This movie would really suit audiences who are frightened easily and who are too scared to watch real heart thumping horror flicks.

EVERY ONE of the scarey's got me, even the cheap one. I never thought the industry would outdeliver the original ""Deliverance,"" but if any movie could be called a sequel, it is ""Wrong Turn."" Desmond Harrington and Eliza Dushku are winners! Harrington's acting finally motivated me to register with IMDb just so I could vote for him.

Yes it's like a 70's horror flick, yes it's been done before, but isn't it just recreating the 70's famous horror genre and atmosphere, so that we can watch a good, old fashion horror, the way it was meant to be?The opening scene, is personally, I think, one of the best I have seen for many a year. The characters were likeable, come on you're telling me you didn't root for Jessie when she went treetop luring?Okay so they went into a scary cabin in the middle of nowhere woods, BUT they were warned against it by some of the characters, and they gave good reason, they desperately needed a phone.I'm not convinced by the negative comments I've heard about this film, I would urge anyone to watch it for the first time.

As mentioned by previous reviewers, it does contain the basic ""recipe"" for a contemporary horror movie (kids stranded in the woods); however, this movie is at least a cut above the rest. Very well done, not cheesy. Also, I do believe that there was an opening at the end for a possible sequel. Has anyone heard anything about that possibility (sequel)?

Granted the acting wasn't the best but that's not exactly what I look for in a horror movie. It reminded me of a time when horror movies just were. There were no complicated story lines. You didn't have to figure out anything. It is just about simple entertainment. I get annoyed at movies like Darkness ( Anna Paquin ) and The Ring. I spend so much time trying to figure out the plot I can't enjoy the movie.While I'm here I have to comment on Carly's Character. A lot of people seemed to think she was annoying. I would like to say it was one of the most realistic reactions to watching your fiancé die in front you that I have ever seen. Of course your going to cry. Duh! I actually thought that Chris Flynn was played very emotionless. I can't imagine anyone being so calm about the situationThat being said it was awesome. Great death scenes. Scary Mountain men.

Some pretty cool deaths in the movie, standard 'jumpy' parts and the usual you'd expect from a movie in this genre. The movie has an on going chill of suspense throughout which makes the movie even better. My only problem with the movie is that it didn't touch much on the history of the ""bad guys"".

They've got it all. Throw in the hoopin', hollerin', disfigured rednecks and you've got yourself a movie.I will say that there are some suspenseful scenes and Wrong Turn is better made than many of Wes Craven's more recent attempts. If you're just looking for a little bit of body chopping and a few of those scenes that make you jump, Wrong Turn will do the job. Even then, though, you can probably do better.

Although the story of a group of friends stuck in the middle of nowhere, being stalked by the unknown is nothing new, the solid acting and fine direction set ""Wrong Turn"" aside. Eliza Dushku (from Buffy) does a very good job of making a strong female lead, and manages to run through the entire film without falling over once. The expertise of award winning special effects maestro, Stan Winston (Alien and Predator) adds to the scare factor of a group of four just trying to survive.
