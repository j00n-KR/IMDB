0,MartinHafer,"As long as you know it ain't really ""Star Trek"" and don't mind, you're in for a nice ride.",8,14 October 2013,"As an old fogey of 49, I can't help but love the original ""Star Trek"" series. To me, this is THE ""Star Trek"". I had difficulty with the last Trek movie, the reboot, as it just seemed to violate so much of the original canon. However, given a bit of time, I guess I can turn off my brain and ignore the inconsistencies between the old and the new--even if the notion of an 'alternate universe' where such inconsistencies are accepted is something I still struggle with a bit.Since this film came out several months ago and by now there are 1832934 reviews (more or less), I won't make my review that long and I won't explain the plot. Sure, it's once again inconsistent--with an entirely new beginning story of how Kirk met his nemesis, Khan. And, it's inconsistent in a few other ways. However, it IS exciting to watch--and never really lets up. Plus, a few of the inconsistencies were still nice homages to the original (such as near the end when a DIFFERENT crew member enters the engines to save the ship and then says goodbye). Overall, a lot of action, a few nice explorations of characters and a film that lovers of Simon Pegg will ADORE since Scotty is given a much larger part in this one than in previous Trek films. Well made all around and well worth seeing. I assume they'll be making more of these and I hope to see them as well...unless they suck like ""Star Trek V"".",Star Trek Into Darkness
1,TheLittleSongbird,"Nowhere near greatness, hardly 'Star Trek's' darkest hour either",6,29 July 2017,"While it was not a perfect series (William Shatner's overacting, less than great production values and an iffy Season 3), the original 'Star Trek' series was a genre landmark and hugely influential and ground-breaking, also a mostly great series in its own right especially for the characters, the relationships and Leonard Nimoy's Spock.The films based on the original series were a mixed bag. A few great ones with 'The Wrath of Khan', 'The Voyage Home' and 'The Undiscovered Country', one in-between film with 'The Search for Spock' and disappointments with 'The Motion Picture' and particularly 'The Final Frontier'. There were ten 'Star Trek' films before this 2009 reboot, four being based on the 'Next Generation series where the only outstanding one was 'First Contact'. 'Generations to me was another in-between film and 'Insurrection' and 'Nemesis' were two other particularly problematic ones.Don't think 'Star Trek Into Darkness' is as good as the generally positive critical reception makes out, despite some really impressive elements (more so than those who dislike the film have made out), it is a heavily flawed film and does disappoint as a 'Star Trek' film. At the same time, as a film on its own 'Star Trek Into Darkness' is pretty decent but admittedly it could have been much better. While the disappointment is understandable and personally concur with a lot of the criticisms, it is nowhere near as bad as 'Star Trek' fans who hated it have said, coming from a subjective person this is not a 1/10 film.Visually, the film mostly looks great. The special effects are mainly fantastic and leave one in awe, while there is audacious and suitably moody cinematography and atmospheric lighting.Michael Giacchino delivers another winner of a music score, don't remember ever being disappointed by this man. Sure it is familiar, but it fits very well with the film and its mood and is unmistakable Giacchino, a beautiful score to listen to and has a lot of atmosphere.Where 'Star Trek Into Darkness' scores highly is in the action, it is staged in a way that generates a huge amount of thrilling excitement, tension and suspense. It's well shot too, and JJ Abrams knows how to deliver on the action and spectacle. The sound effects have a lot of authenticity.Regarding the story, 'Star Trek Into Darkness' evoked mixed reactions from me. It is rich in atmosphere and has some thrilling moments and truly exciting action, while the interplay between Kirk and Spock is brilliantly written and makes one feel quite nostalgic. The casting is in crucial parts bang on with some great performances. Chris Pine has garnered mixed reactions, to me he was more relaxed here and has a charisma that commands the screen.Zachary Quinto once again nails it as Spock, with huge shoes to fill, capturing perfectly what was so iconic about the character in the first place. Karl Urban is suitably cantankerous, Zoe Saldana is sexy and fiery and Leonard Nimoy makes a moving cameo. Best of all is Benedict Cumberbatch, who is sensational as Khan and is the best thing about the film, Khan is also the most interesting and most developed character and Cumberbatch gives him menacing intensity and sympathetic melancholy, a character who you fear but in some way understand his point of view.'Star Trek Into Darkness' has a lot of faults though. The script has some clunky moments, has comedy that really doesn't gel and is not very funny and fails to provoke much thought or have much depth, some of it feels dumbed down. Character development, something that 'Star Trek' at its best was particularly good in, is mostly lacking, outside of Khan, most of the cast actually are criminally underused and are very bland in personality (Urban was fine but was too much in the background), Alice Eve is little more than a window dressing plot device that felt incidental to the story and Simon Pegg (who is very funny in other roles) is irritating comic relief.Despite some good moments, the story was very problematic. That it has a lot of inconsistencies and continuity errors is just one problem, more of an issue was that some of it was in need of much more clarity because some of it is convoluted and under-explored, the big reveal is clumsy and far too obvious and the romance is shoe-horned, forced, underdeveloped and completely unnecessary.Although most of the film was well made, a few of the techniques that distracted a lot in 'Star Trek' (2009), especially the lens flares, still distract and look cheap. Abrams does action and spectacle well, but fails on what is a large part of 'Star Trek's' appeal when at its best which is the writing and the characterisation, both problematically executed and robs the film of heart and soul. The film is all big and noisy, but the brains and heart are missing.Overall, nowhere near greatness but hardly the franchise's darkest hour. 6/10 Bethany Cox",Star Trek Into Darkness
2,bkoganbing,Khan has returned,7,24 June 2013,"Zachary Quinto as Mr. Spock shows more emotion in Star Trek Into Darkness than Leonard Nimoy did during the entire run of the series and the various big screen incarnations. Considering the stress that he and Chris Pine as Captain Kirk are under in this one it is understandable.It's hard to tell who the enemy is in this one. We've got a Star Fleet Admiral played by Peter Weller who is sending the Enterprise on one dangerous mission and it seems more and more like its real purpose was to provoke the Klingons into an all out war.Their mission was to essentially assassinate a man named John Harrison who has defected to the Klingon Empire. But the last time such an assassination was ordered it was for either Admiral Yamamoto and for Osama Bin Laden. And the people carrying those missions out did not have the weaponry of the Enterprise.Instead Kirk takes Harrison alive which fouls up the plans of a lot of people. And Harrison whose real name is Khan and is played by Benedict Cumberbatch has really got an agenda all his own.By the name you'll recognize this as kind of a remake of the classic Star Trek, The Wrath Of Khan. But if you think you know then as a good Trekkie what's coming then you're in for a surprise. Important variations are made to the plot.The high standard of good science fiction and characters of idealism and fortitude that all the incarnations of the Enterprise have shown are faithfully retained here. This is truly the next generation of Star Trek.",Star Trek Into Darkness
3,Leofwine_draca,"Straight-up action, thus better than the first",6,9 September 2017,"STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS is the second film in the rebooted STAR TREK series, following on from the lacklustre first. The good news is that this one's a definite improvement, a straight-up action flick with a fast pace that takes your mind off the less-than-impressive moralising and character development of the cast. It starts off very well indeed, with Kirk and co. at the mercy of an unknown mega-villain running rings around Star Fleet, before turning into a typical outer space adventure in the second half.As an ensemble production, few of the cast get a real look-in, with an annoyingly 'heroic' Chris Pine failing to get the viewer on side (he was much better in UNSTOPPABLE) as Kirk and Zachary Quinto a bit stiff as Spock. Simon Pegg is better in his usual comic relief role (the same as his one in the MISSION IMPOSSIBLE franchise) while newcomer Alice Eve is a bit too chipper. It's left to the old pros like Bruce Greenwood and Peter Weller to really excel, although Benedict Cumberbatch is fine too as the villain of the piece, lit to look very much like an alien. Watch out for a great little cameo late on. The rest is a mash-up of heroism, endless CGI spectacle, and ordinary plotting.",Star Trek Into Darkness
4,SnoopyStyle,JJ Abrams reworks Star Trek 2,6,22 October 2013,"Captain Kirk (Chris Pine) ignores the Prime Directive to save Spock (Zachary Quinto) on a mission. Uhura (Zoe Saldana) is relieved. After terrorist attacks killing Adm. Pike, Adm. Macus (Peter Weller) sends Kirk on a mission to kill renegade John Harrison (Benedict Cumberbatch) who has escaped to the Klingon homeworld Kronos. They are joined by weapons specialist Dr. Carol Marcus (Alice Eve) and a new type of photon torpedo despite objections from Scotty (Simon Pegg).I appreciate the idea of reworking Star Trek 2 in this alternate universe. However if we are to compare the two, there are differences that don't shine a favorable light on this one. Whereas the 1982 original was operatic, poetic, and fun. This one is loud, lumbering, and dark. JJ Abrams must have expected the comparisons. This one is definitely flashier, and better looking. The CG sequences are awe inspiring like most of them today. We have advanced quite a ways.The original was one of good versus evil. They were simple sides. This one, we're trying to use Khan, then we're fighting him. It's not as clean of a storyline. There was a lot of minor questionable things like.... Why hide Enterprise in the ocean? Why put the bodies in the photon torpedoes? How did they get back to Earth all of a sudden? They're all minor and ignorable. But it builds an uneasy sense that something's not right. My analogy is that the 1982 movie is a perfectly solved Rubik's Cube. This one JJ Abrams jumbled all the pieces, put glitter all over it, and photoshop the heck out of it.",Star Trek Into Darkness
5,Hitchcoc,Too Many Fistfights but Enjoyable,8,7 June 2013,"As with most my age (mid-sixties), I've been through them all. Every attempt to nuance the regiment of characters that have spanned the realizable galaxy that is the home of the Star Trek conglomerate. I am pleased that there is less self-caricature than previously, less smirking and lame attempt at humor. This is an admirable attempt at a really good adventure. One of the reviewers likened it to ""Raiders"" and its ilk. The problem for me is that while I was taken in once again by a pretty good adventure story with amazing special effects, when I left, I had nothing that stayed with me more than a few hours. One of the problems with the high-tech world and the incredible expense involved is that we slip back to the lowest common denominator, lest we lose a less hip audience. My contention is that we can have highly intelligent science fiction without catering strictly to the nerd element or comic book purists. That involves writing. That involves not having an incredibly complex set of circumstances resolved through a fistfight on some Harold Lloyd, moving girder set. I think the potential is there. How about stretching things a bit more. When ""The City on the Edge of Tomorrow"" appeared lo those many years ago, the arrogant wunderkind Harlan Ellison took the Trek people to a wonderful place by ""writing a really good script."" Since Hollywood can do things it never could before, how about tapping into it and doing something incredible. I thought that our refugee from Sherlock Holmes had a great sinister quality that should have been embraced. So much for that. He is pretty much talk and pretty vulnerable.Again, I think this is well worth seeing, but I think that there is so much potential for something glorious.",Star Trek Into Darkness
6,claudio_carvalho,The Enemy of My Enemy Is My Friend,8,15 September 2013,"After violating the Prime Directive of the Federation interfering with the primitive inhabitants of Planet Nibiru, saving their lives from a volcanic eruption and exposing the Enterprise to them to save Spock (Zachary Quinto), Captain James Kirk (Chris Pine) is summoned by Admiral Christopher Pike (Bruce Greenwood) and loses the command of the Enterprise.Meanwhile, a Starfleet facility in London is bombed and the high-command has a meeting where the identity of the responsible, the former agent John Harrison (Benedict Cumberbatch), is disclosed. However, Harrison attacks the commanders; kills Spike and flees to Kronos, the land of the Klingons. Admiral Alexander Marcus (Peter Weller) assigns Kirk to kill Harrison and brings seventy-two torpedoes to the Enterprise to accomplish the mission. Chief Engineer Montgomery Scotty (Simon Pegg) refuses to receive the weapons and Pavel Chekov (Anton Yelchin) is relocated to his position and Dr. Carol Wallace (Alice Eve), who is a science officer specialized in weapons, joins the Enterprise crew. When they arrive in Kronos, they are attacked by Klingons but out of the blue, Harrison kills the Klingons and surprisingly surrenders to Kirk after knowing that the torpedoes are on board of the Enterprise. Then he discloses that he is Khan, a superhuman that was awakened by Marcus from a cryogenic pod to prepare the star-ships with powerful weapons for a war against the Klingons. When the Enterprise is intercepted by a mysterious starship commanded by Admiral Marcus, Kirk asks Khan to help him to save his crew.""Star Trek into Darkness"" is a great sci-fi with a good story of Kirk and his crew and a powerful villain. The good acting and direction associated to top-notch special effects make a highly entertaining movie. Surprisingly there are bad reviews in IMDb that must be ignored by those that like this franchise. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Star Trek Além da Escuridão"" (""Star Trek beyond the Darkness"")",Star Trek Into Darkness
7,nogodnomasters,We can not fire and we can not flee.,10,13 March 2018,"In order to appreciate this film, one must be familiar with the original series as well as the film series. To talk about the plot is pointless, other than to say Khan is back. Benedict Cumberbatch is a rather boring Khan who lacks the exotic look and class of Ricardo Montalban. Fortunately the cast of regulars can carry the film.The film also introduces Carol Marcus (Alice Eve). In the original film version Carol Marcus was an early conquest of Kirk (Chris Pine). She would have his child, a son who was ultimately killed by Klingons. If you have never seen the Khan film, then the juxtapositions in this film will be meaningless and the genius and enjoyment hindered.Another aspect of the early series is that it was reflective of the era with Klingons representing Russia and Romulans being China. That symbolism is meaningless today, so our writers cleverly use the aspect of terrorism as a way to maintain the original flavor of the series. Likewise the character of James Kirk, who did things on hunches and ""out of the box"" is maintained in this film, perhaps the only real reason we tolerated Shatner in that role in the first place.Dialogue is recycled. Zachary Quinto captures Spock. The role of Uhura has been expanded and Zoe Saldana kicks a lot of women to the curb. Bones (Karl Urban) still throws out the metaphors. Simon Pegg still needs to work on Scotty. John Cho is working hard to fill the big shoes of Sulu, whose stardom has multiplied as an Amazon reviewer. There is mention of Nurse Christine Chapel from the original TV and film series which didn't fit into the plot, perhaps a clue to the next script, or maybe I missed something. Perhaps some nice Trekkie could toss me a bone on this one in the comments section and I can edit this review.Be warned, there is zero character introduction. If you don't know who these characters are, the film will just be a special effects meh. The picture has its light moments, but I thought could use some more. Hopefully the next film we can re-introduce Harry Mudd a Star Trek favorite who made two episode appearances.Parental Guide: No f-bombs, sex, or nudity. A man wakes up in bed with two women. Alice Eve bra/panties.",Star Trek Into Darkness
8,kosmasp,Sci Fi light,8,29 August 2013,"To please the mass fan base is very difficult. And Star Trek and/or any of the spin offs that came from it, has a huge fan base. While I was more aware of the Next Generation TV show than the other shows that exist, I still appreciate what they're doing in recreating something known. I liked the first one (even despite the criticism it got) and thought it was really good.This one continues in the same vain, with great action and superb effects. Quinto and Pine really dug into their roles and the relationship they're having is what makes this movie really good. Having Alice Eve as a new face in it (her character will have people trying to guess what she's up to) also helps. Funnily enough her beautiful body seems to have distressed a few people who thought it was too ""erotic"" for a Star Trek movie. Before I even watched the movie I asked around (in Germany) and no one could pin point a scene that they thought was too risky! After watching it, I still think: ""Too much ado about nothing"".So let that not hinder your viewing experience! Enjoy a really good Science Fiction movie",Star Trek Into Darkness
9,classicsoncall,"""Why is there a man in that torpedo?""",7,19 May 2013,"I suppose the problem seasoned citizens like myself (some would call us old farts) have with re-boots like ""Star Trek Into Darkness"", is that we retain a sense of history and continuity with the original TV series or movies upon which the sequels are based. This wouldn't be a concern for the casual movie-goer or Trek fan, but I have an issue when a canonical character like Captain Christopher Pike (Bruce Greenwood) from the original series chapters ""The Menagerie, Parts I and II"", winds up dying in this film instead of peacefully living out his cerebral life on Talos IV the last time Kirk and Spock left him. And that would have been AFTER the events of this movie. I really wish screen writers wouldn't take it upon themselves to destroy continuity like that, but I know I'm barking up the wrong tree on this.There are other things too that don't blend well with Star Trek lore and history. Admiral Marcus (Peter Weller) going rogue the way he did to force a Klingon war would have been way out of bounds for Starfleet Command, and they would certainly have gotten involved before this movie was over. Kirk (Chris Pine) being de-commissioned and promoted again in the space of I don't know, maybe twenty minutes or so felt almost ludicrous to me. Yeah I know, he's the Captain and all, but how about developing that story line a bit if that's the way we're going.Now there were other things one might expect would have bothered me but didn't, so I'd like to touch on those as well. The young Spock (Zachary Quinto) actually crying real tears would be totally out of character for Leonard Nimoy, but I think the film set that up pretty well with remarks about Spock balancing his Vulcan and Earthly origins. Same thing with Uhura's (Zoe Saldana) flirtations with the First Officer; harking back to the first two episodes of the Sixties series ('The Man Trap' and 'Charlie X'), Nichelle Nichols behaved in a similar manner before the Spock character morphed into a being of pure logic. So I thought those precursors to the original Star Trek was a neat way of bringing ST history right in line with the TV show's stated mission of boldly going where no man had gone before.Besides that, most of the rest was simply action, relentless and galaxy defying destructive action on a grand scale. Personally I would forego some of that for the sake of more character and story line development, but alas, this is apparently a different era. I understand that, and for that reason I refrain from skewering the film too badly. I guess there's a place for it for modern day film fans who want over the top excitement and action in every flick, but I wonder what the reaction would be if a they made a film with as much thought and creativity that went into making 'The Menagerie' or 'Space Seed'. I could just hear Spock giving it his single word movie review - 'Fascinating'.",Star Trek Into Darkness
10,lee_eisenberg,"cool story, but it goes overboard on the action",7,1 October 2013,"I haven't seen the 2009 ""Star Trek"", so I don't fully know the path that the new franchise is supposed to be taking. I will admit that ""Star Trek Into Darkness"" has a neat plot. Unfortunately, the movie goes a little overboard on all the action. The scientific aspect was what always made the franchise enjoyable, and excessive action weakens that. Even so, it's always fun to see the characters do their stuff, namely Spock's hyper-rationality. My favorite scene is the end: it features the opening narration from the original series. In addition to the main cast, there are also appearances by SNL cast member Bill Hader as additional voices, Heather Langenkamp (Nancy in ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"") as Moto, and yes, Leonard Nimoy as Spock Prime. Judging by this movie and ""Super 8"", J.J. Abrams is worth paying attention to as a director.",Star Trek Into Darkness
11,jboothmillard,Star Trek into Darkness,7,9 March 2017,"The first in reboot movie, the prequel to the original TV series, was a big success for fans and ""Trekkies"" alike, so there was big excitement for the sequel, from Lost creator and director J.J. Abrams (Mission: Impossible III, Super 8, Star Wars: The Force Awakens). Basically in the 23rd century, Captain James T. Kirk (Chris Pine) is removed from command of the USS Enterprise for violation, after saving the ship and Commander Spock (Heroes' Zachary Quinto) from a volcanic eruption on the planet Nibiru, exposing the ship to the primitive inhabitants. Admiral Christopher Pike (Bruce Greenwood) is reinstated as commanding officer, while Kirk is demoted and Spock is transferred to another ship. Shortly after, the Section 31 installation in London is bombed, the perpetrator is renegade Starfleet operative John Harrison (Benedict Cumberbatch), he then attacks Starfleet Headquarters, Pike and other senior officers are killed, Kirk tries to stop him, but Harrison escapes transporting to Kronos, the home world of the hostile Klingons. Kirk and Spock are reinstated to the Enterprise by Admiral Alexander Marcus (Peter Weller), they are ordered to kill Harrison, Chief Engineer Montgomery ""Scotty"" Scott (Simon Pegg) resigns in protesting after objecting to untested torpedoes on board the ship, he is replaced by Pavel Chekov (Anton Yelchin). En route to Kronos, the Enterprise's warp capabilities have been disabled, Kirk leads Spock, Lieutenant Nyota Uhura (Zoe Saldana) and a team onto the planet, there they are ambushed by Klingons, dispatched by Harrison, but he surrenders after learning the number of torpedoes aboard the Enterprise. These torpedoes in fact contain humans in stasis, this is discovered after one is opened by Dr. Leonard ""Bones"" McCoy (Karl Urban) and Dr. Carol Marcus (Alice Eve), Marcus's daughter, Harrison reveals his true identity as a genetically engineered superhuman named Khan, he awakened after centuries of suspended animation by Admiral Marcus. Khan also reveals it was Marcus that sabotaged the Enterprise's warp drive, in order for the Klingons to destroy the ship, and to trigger a war, Kirk is given a set of coordinates by Khan, he contacts Scotty to investigate, in his search he finds a covert Starfleet facility near Jupiter. A much larger Federation warship commanded by Admiral Marcus, USS Vengeance, intercepts the Enterprise, Kirk ignores Marcus's demands to deliver Khan, the warp drive is hastily repaired, but Marcus disables the Enterprise near the Moon, Marcus stops attacking when realising Carol is on the ship. But Carol is transported to the Vengeance and Marcus orders the Enterprise be destroyed, he rejects Kirk's offer of himself and Khan to spare his crew, suddenly though the Vengeance loses power, after Scotty sabotages it. Kirk and Khan are forced to work together, with the transporters down they space-jump to the Vengeance, Spock meanwhile contacts his older self (Leonard Nimoy), he warns that Khan is ruthless and untrustworthy, he was only defeated at a terrible cost. Khan manages to overpower Kirk, Scotty and Carol, seizing control of the Vengeance, he eventually transports the three of them back to the Enterprise, but then betrays their agreement by critically damaging the ship, both starships are caught in Earth's gravity and plummet towards the surface. Kirk sacrifices himself, entering the radioactive reactor chamber to repair the warp core, he loses his life in the process, the Enterprise is saved, while the Vengeance crashes into San Francisco, with Khan attempting to destroy Starfleet headquarters, Spock transports down in pursuit. Khan is captured, Bones discovers his blood has regenerative properties, that may save Kirk, in the end Kirk is revived and reinstated as the Enterprise's captain, Khan is arrested and re-frozen, sealed in his cryogenic pod, and the Enterprise crew embarks on a five-year exploratory mission. Also starring John Cho as Lieutenant Hikaru Sulu, Noel Clarke as Thomas Harewood and Heather Langenkamp as Moto. The cast of younger actors playing the well- known characters remain suited to their roles, Cumberbatch is just about as sinister as Ricardo Montalban was, the story has good moments, the special effects are of course fantastic, to create the alien creatures and big explosive action sequences, a terrific sequel to continuing franchise, a worthwhile science- fiction adventure. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Visual Effects, it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Special Visual Effects, and it was nominated the BAFTA Children's Award for Kids Vote - Feature Film. Very good!",Star Trek Into Darkness
12,Tweekums,The return of Khan,9,26 July 2016,"This, the second of JJ Abrams reboot of the franchise, opens with Kirk breaking the Prime Directive in order to save Spock; this leads to him being relieved of his command and Spock being transferred to another ship inevitably events soon prevents this from happening. John Harrison; a renegade Star Fleet operative attacks a Star Fleet facility in London then attacks senior members at Star Fleet headquarters before teleporting to Kronos; the Klingon homeward. Admiral Marcus orders Kirk to take the Enterprise to Kronos and kill Harrison using new undetectable missiles. Scotty objects to having the missiles on board and resigns and Spock questions the order to kill Harrison; a clear breach of Federation law. Kirk ultimately decides to ignore Marcus's order and captures Harrison alive; at this point he learns that Harrison is not who he had been told he is the genetically engineered psychopath Khan! He also learns that Marcus has his own agenda; he wants to militarise Star Fleet and is willing to destroy the Enterprise as part of that plan.This is an impressive film that has plenty of details that should please fans of the original series without distracting from the story for people new to the franchise. The appearance of Khan is the most obvious of course but there are also passing mentions of tribbles, Mudd, Gorn and no doubt some that I missed! The story is impressive and as well as a good plot we get plenty of action. This action is both exciting and varied. The story builds up to a conclusion that nicely mirrors that in 'The Wrath of Khan' without being an exact copy. As one would expect from a Star Trek film the characters and their interactions are at the core of the story; the main cast has a great chemistry making us believe that their characters are real people who have been working together for a while. Benedict Cumberbatch does a fine job as Khan; quietly menacing but not to such a degree that he is obviously evil. Peter Weller is also impressive as the imposing Admiral Marcus. Overall an impressive film that should satisfy both fans of the original and those who joined the franchise in the JJ Abrams era.",Star Trek Into Darkness

Our heroes find an unstoppable force of terror from within their own organization and go out to capture a one-man weapon of mass destruction .This epic story is concentrated on characters as well as thrill-packed action and special effects although there're numerous of that too . The movie has thrills , tension , emotion, suspense and sensational spacial scenarios like is customary development of the franchise . Spectacular, exciting , fast-paced , thrilling this is the description of this new outing of Star Trek , film that reinvents the saga through a perfect pulse narrative that does not give a second of rest to the spectator who is trapped for two hours approx. in a genuine visual spectacle . Idealism ,humor , humanity , several agreeable characters and trademark effects abound and will please the enthusiasts such as the neophyte . As our heroes are propelled into an epic chess game of life and death, love will be challenged, friendships will be torn apart, and sacrifices must be made for the only family Kirk has left: his crew. The nice acting convinces , especially the avenger Benedict Cumberbatch in a super-villain role , Zachary Quinto, and the sympathetic Simon Pegg , while other players also make a fine work . And of course , special appearance of Leonard Nimoy in an emotive and enjoyable intervention. Stirring final amazing the spectator , in which the moving and spectacular scenes create a perfect union that terminates with an ending that leaves you stuck in the armchair facing the formidable spectacle as a privileged witness . Interesting screenplay , as screenwriters Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman explained that the dilemma for the sequel was whether to pit the crew against another villain like in Star Trek (2009), or to have an ""exploration sci-fi plot where the unknown and nature itself is somehow an adversary"", like on Star Trek , the original series (1966). Breathtaking soundtrack by Michael Giacchino , he composes an impressive musical accompaniment to the film . This marks the first time a Star Trek film has shot outside the United States, with shooting in Iceland for special effects sequences. Furthermore , a colorful and evocative cinematography by Daniel Mindel . Paramount Pictures requested that director J.J. Abrams make the film in 3D ; however, Abrams wanted to shoot the two-dimensionally on film using IMAX cameras ; the two compromised, making this the first feature film to be shot in IMAX and converted to 3D in post-production . Suitable for family viewing , it's an entertaining adventure which young and old men will enjoy . Fans of the series will find very amusing and fun . It is fun to watch and Trekkies are sure to love it , resulting to be one of the best science-fiction sequels of all time and the highest grossing film of all the Star Trek movies.",Star Trek Into Darkness
14,paul_haakonsen,Star Trekking across the universe...,6,20 August 2013,"Visually, then ""Star Trek: Into Darkness"" is a real treat; eye-candy if you will. The CGI is really great and the designs are really nice to look at.Storywise, well then ""Star Trek: Into Darkness"" did falter a bit. Sure, it was entertaining and all, lots of drama, thrills and fast paced action. However, the story did seem a little bit like it left things not fully wrapped up. And why re-use a villain from a previous movie, that was simply beyond my comprehension.Given, I have never been a ""Star Trek"" fan, more of a ""Star Wars"" fan, truth be told. But still, I have watched the movies for the fact that they are a big part of the Sci-Fi genre, and they have been entertaining. But there is just something profound missing from the entire Star Trek universe somehow. What it is, I don't know.The people playing the various roles here in ""Star Trek: Into Darkness"" were doing good jobs, both newcomers and those returning from the previous ""Star Trek"" movie from 2009.I am sure that Trekkies around the galaxy will enjoy this movie tremendously. I watched it as a Sci-Fi movie, without a prior attachment to the Star Trek universe, and as such it did provide good entertainment. Sure, there were clichés to be found here and there, and the outcome of the story was predictable. But enjoy the movie for the thrill ride, the action, the journey into space, and boldly go where no one has gone before.In my opinion, then ""Star Trek: Into Darkness"" wasn't fully as enjoyable and entertaining as the 2009 ""Star Trek"" movie, because the 2009 movie had a more solid and thought-through storyline. And as such, this movie is getting a 6 out of 10 stars rating from me.",Star Trek Into Darkness
15,blanche-2,I like my my men like I like my eggs - Benedict,8,24 May 2013,"Up front, I have to admit a few things. The last Star Trek film I saw was with the original TV cast. I have never seen The Next Generation. I went to see this film because I love Benedict Cumberbatch. I wasn't disappointed.I think J.J. Abrams was trying to have something for everyone in ""Star Trek Into Darkness"" - reminders of the TV show (which of course I have seen) and remnants of the very popular movie Star Trek: The Wrath of Khan (which I also saw).I'm not speaking as a die-hard Trekkie. I was glad I saw this in the theater, as the effects were awesome. Chris Pine, Zachary Quinto and the rest of the Star Trek crew were excellent in their roles, and Benedict Cumberbatch was an exquisite villain.Everyone is complaining about Alice Eve's underwear shot. I say give equal time - Benedict had a shower scene that was cut. Also, if her father was played by Peter Weller and he's supposed to be American, why didn't she have an American accent? I can't nitpick like others can. If you're disappointed, I'm sorry, and if I were more familiar with the Star Trek canon, maybe I would be as well. But for pure entertainment, it was excellent.",Star Trek Into Darkness
16,Quinoa1984,(cue shouting iconic name of villain with the word: Reboot),6,18 May 2013,"I actually do recommend the movie, it's good in an overall manner of speaking. The performances never falter, actors like Karl Urban and Simon Pegg never falter when given good lines to say and things to do emotionally in a scene, and Benedict Cumberbatch is fantastic as John Harrison - until his character starts losing interest past things like clear motivations or stakes past 'destroy everything'. The performances aren't the problem. Into Darkness suffers in the sense that I saw with Abrams' own Super 8 (Spielberg movies), as well as Prometheus (Alien(s)), which also was co-scripted by Damon Lindelof (seriously, has he just not been on top of things since Lost?), where there is just a streak, mostly after the halfway mark, of blatant fan-service. By this I mean that the movie starts out with a good premise, and being from a good place to do something different. But there comes a point where the makers lay out their cards, and the film becomes something else, something *too* familiar. I was fine with them actually bringing back Kahn to the world, in a way. This is the 'alternate' time-line (ala, again, Lost), but maybe they could do something new with him, being unthawed and back to reaping what he's after. Maybe there could have been something there. But from the moment 'John Harrison' says who he is, little by little, in a snowballing effect, the Bad Robot group just does not have it in them to let go of Space Seed/Wrath of Khan. Yes, there is not quite the vendetta that Khan had against Kirk. But at the same time that they were trying little things differently, there was always a sense of where the film was going to go. The writers - also Kurtzman and Orci who wrote the first rebooted film in 2009 - try and inject a lot of seemingly mind-blowing twists into the framework. Needless to say I could see almost all of them coming. And it was not as if I was looking out for this; it comes down to some simple screen writing plot-basics crap, which, in theory, should be fine. Kirk's arc is that he doesn't respect authority, does things his own way, and at the start of the film (again, I have to reiterate, the film has a wonderful set-up, especially with a trip to an indigenous alien planet that goes awry with saving Spock and revealing their ship to a race of aliens), it's clear where Kirk has to go. He must prove himself, if not to himself than to his crew or (again, spoiler) the memory of his mentor, Christopher Pike. Sacrifice is the deal here. And guess what - this time the twists and turns, for all of the characters, are... let's just say not quite organic to the film in and of itself. At least entirely.An homage here and there is fine. Hell, they brought back the tribbles for this one. The problem comes where it's just too obvious, and in Into Darkness it becomes too obvious where the makers are taking their material, which is, basically, anything very memorable about Wrath of Khan or parts of the episode Space Seed, all the way down to a death scene (with a reverse I guess, but still to the note) and a famous exclamation against aforementioned villain. It doesn't quite end the same way as its main influence. Maybe that's a good thing. Search for Spock is safe, for now. But at the same time it ultimately leaves the movie, a thrilling ride for parts of it and never exactly boring, into a place where its this: for a film called Into Darkness, it's too safe, and little plants put in by the writers pay off far too easily. Some fun action, an ideal cast still and performing the hell out of material that is familiar. But it's also frustratingly uneven and does a strange thing for the audience - half of the people seeing this, more or less, will be people familiar with the predecessors. The other half may be young people unfamiliar with TOS or WoK. For the former, I suspect, things will just ultimately come off awkward, laughable even, and odd. For the latter it may be fine, though they may not see some of the plot strands left behind (Klingons, seriously, what happened there?) in lieu of stroking off a portion of cinematic history. It makes one look at Tarantino as subtle by comparison of lifting from influences.",Star Trek Into Darkness
17,CinemaSerf,"Less philosophising, more phasers...",7,25 December 2020,"I will own up to actually quite enjoying this. It has less of the holier-than-thou moralism of some of the ""Star Trek"" features and is basically just a sci-fi adventure that pitches Chris Pine (""Kirk"") and his crew against enemies as they say - both foreign and domestic! The dynamic between Pine and ""Spock"" (Zachary Quinto) still doesn't quite work for me; but Karl Urban makes for quite a good ""McCoy"" complete with all his daft metaphors. (The less said about Simon Pegg's ""Scotty"", the better - but fortunately, he features sparingly). The ""Enterprise"" must track down the arch-criminal ""Khan"" (Benedict Cumberbatch) - responsible for a bombing in London and then an attack on Starfleet Command - in dangerous Klingon territory and off they set armed with some distinctly dodgy torpedoes. There's a bit of jovial banter between the unlikely couple of ""Uhura"" and ""Spock"" which raises a smile, and Anton Yeltsin still has trouble with the computer comprehending his ""w's"". It's got plenty of phaser fights, the shirts get ripped quite a few times and the story has a bit of definition to help it move along. The last fifteen minutes do, however, drag out the ending just a bit too much - but hey, if you are looking for some high-end science fiction with a few twists in the plot and a good look to it, then you could do worse than this.",Star Trek Into Darkness
18,writers_reign,Ex Benedict,6,10 May 2013,"I guess I'm closer to the average man in the street than an out-and-out Trekkie. I watched several re-runs of the original - Kirk, Spock, Bones - and the second team - Picard, Data, Crusher, Gordy - on TV but only saw sections of some of the movies before 2009. This one started out badly; an away team were being pursued by matchstick men swathed in bandages, for all the world like Egyptian Mummys who somehow escaped mid-embalming before the hands and legs were bound. This was like an Ed Wood movie made for HALF a stick of gum. Once this was resolved - turns out they were trying to save a primitive planet - and we got back to earth the movie picked up. Most of the 'action' sequences left me cold, just hardware slugging it out with other hardware and destroying cities in the process, but the characters were well drawn and given close to grown-up dialog to speak. The acting was slightly better than you'd expect in this kind of film, like a graduating class at Drama School end of term production. Worth a look",Star Trek Into Darkness
19,zardoz-13,Top-Notch Trek,10,27 May 2013,"Movies have always reflected the concerns of society. Like ""Iron Man 3,"" ""Star Trek Into Darkness"" follows a cold-blooded terrorist through the galaxy who conjures up chaos in this science fiction ""Zero Dark Thirty"" manhunt. Mind you, the filmmakers have refrained from identifying any specific ethnic or religious group in this 23rd century tale. ""Super 8"" director J.J. Abrams' dynamic sequel reassembles virtually the entire cast as well as some minor characters from his 2009 ""Star Trek"" reboot. Remember those cadets who gave Kirk a bloody nose in Iowa? They're back, too. Similarly, Chris Pine returns as Captain James T. Kirk, along with Zachary Quinto as the pointy-eared Mr. Spock, Zoe Saldana as Lieutenant Nyota Uhura, Karl Urban as Dr. Leonard ""Bones"" McCoy, and Simon Pegg as Lieutenant Commander Montgomery ""Scotty"" Scott. Unlike the original Roddenberry film franchise with William Shatner, Leonard Nimoy, and DeForest Kelly, nobody in Abrams' ""Star Trek"" gets cheated out of screen time, particularly peripheral characters like John Cho's Lieutenant Hikaru Sulu and Anton Yelchin's Ensign Pavel Chekov. The performances are uniformly top-notch, with Pine relishing Kirk's action hero impetuosity and Quinto delivering his lines about truth and logic with a straight-faced, impersonality that makes you smile at his subtlety. Incidentally, Mr. Spock learns how to tell a lie without flinching in this outing. Urban gets most of the laughs with his observations about McCoy's shortcomings. Unfortunately, the traditional ""Trek"" villains- those diabolical Klingons—are confined to just one scene while the senior Spock (Leonard Nimoy) appears briefly during a televised conversation between his younger counterpart and himself. Trekkers who hated the 2009 ""Star Trek"" will probably abhor ""Star Trek Into Darkness,"" while more open-minded Trekker will embrace the changes.Every film franchise requires a treacherous villain. Happily, ""Star Trek Into Darkness"" has forged a ferocious foe. Enigmatic Starfleet Commander John Harrison (Benedict Cumberbatch of the BBC's ""Sherlock"") with his glacial stare and warmly uttered words is so thoroughly malignant that you'd probably pummel the gifted British actor who portrays him. Basically, Harrison possesses several advantages over his adversaries that cannot be revealed without spoiling this suspenseful saga. Meanwhile, Harrison has a bomb detonated in downt0wn London during the year 2259.55 that galvanizes Starfleet into swift action. Specifically, Harrison blackmailed an officer assigned to Section 31 of a Starfleet archive to blow it up inside and then takes credit for the catastrophe. Gimlet-eyed Starfleet Admiral Alexander Marcus (Peter Weller of ""RoboCop"") laments the deaths of 42 people in the explosion. As the calculating Harrison, Cumberbatch delivers such a hypnotic performance that he makes you forget anybody else is in the scene. He is the Magneto of the ""Star Trek"" movies. Nonetheless, Weller provides stiff competition despite his considerably shorter screen time. Weller emerges as the equivalent of a hawkish, Strategic Air Command general from the 1964, Stanley Kubrick epic ""Doctor Strangelove"" (1964) who wants to shoot first and forget any questions. Indeed, Admiral Marcus considers the Klingon Empire every bit as wicked as most SAC generals considered the Communist Empire. Marcus wants Harrison dispatched with extreme prejudice, and Kirk wants to personally execute those orders after Harrison launches an audacious attack on the war room with a helicopter-style gunship. This massacre reminded me of a similar scene in the Al Pacino epic ""The Godfather 3."" Afterwards, Harrison goes gallivanting off into forbidden Klingon territory where Starfleet lacks jurisdiction. Kirk resumes command of the Enterprise after violating a prime directive and pursues Harrison with an array of 72, new, photon torpedoes. Neither Mr. Spock nor Scotty approve of the idea of killing Harrison without the due process of a trial.Despite its ominous title, this splendid Paramount Pictures release doesn't hide in the shadows of its stellar predecessor. Actually, Abrams and ""Transformers"" scenarists Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman, abetted by ""Lost"" co-creator Damon Lindelof have taken the franchise farther than the first. You get to see more of San Francisco and the futuristic contraptions that people travel around in. Watching ""Star Trek Into Darkness"" is like—to borrow the cliché—riding a runaway roller-coaster on a figure-eight trestle with flames chasing you. Abrams and company give them a little bit of everything to do except travel in time. One scene has our hero and villain decked out like Buck Rodgers plunging through space This review covers the 2-D, not the 3-D version.. Prepare yourself for surprises galore as the filmmakers, clearly all fans of Gene Roddenberry's ground-breaking science fiction TV series, show you things that you might never have imagined or perhaps tolerated in earlier incarnations. The special effects look impressive, especially the space debris between the USS Enterprise and the USS Vengeance during a taut stand-off scene. Not only does the narrative take place on the Enterprise bridge but also on Earth in San Francisco as well as on a Class M Planet called Nimbus. Technically, although it is sequel, ""Star Trek Into Darkness"" is still a sequel to a prequel, making it a prequel, too. You'll understand the significance of this during the final moments when the crew of the USS Enterprise embark on their upcoming five-year mission. If you're a hardcore ""Star Trek"" who can handle the liberties that Abrams and company have wrought, you'll probably want to see ""Star Trek Into Darkness"" more than once. I grew up watching the original NBC-TV series when it first aired on Thursday nights. After the show's cancellation, I followed the Enterprise crew onto the silver screen and have thoroughly enjoyed the adventurous Abrams' prequels. The casting is as close to perfect as you can imagine. For the record, I've seen ""Star Trek Into Darkness"" three times, and I'm eagerly awaiting its release on home video.

20,grantss,"Fantastic CGI, nonsensical plot, irritating characters",5,5 April 2014,"Fantastic CGI, nonsensical plot, irritating characters. From the outset, I didn't find the movie that great. This was due to the irritating characters. Didn't like Captain Kirk (or at least Chris Pine's maverick portrayal of him) in the first movie, and that didn't change here. Scotty was just so clichéd, and the constant whining in a fake Scottish accent was annoying. Doctor McCoy was the worst of the lot: even more whiny than Scotty, and everything he said was so cheesy. Every line of Dr McCoy's dialogue had me rolling my eyes.Didn't mind Spock, Sulu or Chekov though.Initially, it looked like the plot might pull the movie through. Was intriguing. However, from a point, it takes a bizarre and nonsensical turn. Kirk basically sides with a terrorist against his own fleet. Its as if JJ Abrams was trying to make a political statement, and a very misguided one.After that the plot is pretty random, and the movie never recovers.CGI is great, of course.No standout performances, in keeping with the annoying characters.",Star Trek Into Darkness

Every time I saw clips or reruns of Star Trek it just seemed corny to me. But, I am a Star Wars fanatic and this had a very Star Wars feel to it: hence, I loved it! I'm not saying that Star Trek Into Darkness (STID) was trying to be Star Wars, I don't think that was the case at all, but the story and the space battles were that epic.This movie was awesome from the opening scene. There was drama and action right away. Immediate action aren't enough for a movie to be deemed good, you'd like a decent plot and some decent acting as well. STID had all three. The story was quite good and offered a lot of conflict on different levels throughout. It helped a lot to have Captain Kirk (Chris Pine) and Dr. Spock (Zachary Quinto) almost always at philosophical odds with one another.There was a lot of good dialog and portentous moments. You were not allowed to just sit down and be mindlessly entertained. This movie triggered thought and emotions. STID was a near perfect blend of action, drama, special effects and story.

The action is great, there are surprises, humour, a wonderful performance of depth and menace from mysterious villain Benedict Cumberbatch, and some great riffs on elements from the original continuity.And when you factor in Mickey from Doctor Who and Alice Eve in her skimpies, what more can you ask for?",Star Trek Into Darkness
23,Uriah43,Flawed But Still Good,6,1 January 2014,"This movie essentially picks up where its predecessor leaves off with the main characters having somewhat established themselves in their individual capacities. More or less. In this specific film a terrorist by the name of ""John Harrison"" (Benedict Cumberbatch) has created significant destruction on earth and has fled to safety on an uninhabited part of the Klingon home world of ""Kronos"". Believing that he is about to give top secret information to the Klingons, ""Captain James T. Kirk"" (Chris Pine) and his crew are sent on a top secret mission to seek out and kill John Harrison from a great distance with newly developed long range torpedoes. But things don't go as planned. At any rate, rather than disclosing what happens next and possibly ruining the movie for those who haven't seen it, I will just say that this was an interesting movie for the most part. Overrated but still interesting. As in the last movie the makers of the film choose to take segments from previous Star Trek television shows or movies and completely rearrange people and events to fit their specific story. And the use of good CGI and plentiful action manages to camouflage any discrepancies. At least for the most part. As such modern viewers will probably enjoy the film for what it appears to be-an enjoyable science-fiction movie. Those who grew up watching the original television series or the Star Trek movies from years past will probably notice the disparities and will base their overall judgment of this film accordingly. Personally, I thought it was a good movie. Flawed but still good. I rate it as slightly above average.",Star Trek Into Darkness
24,ferguson-6,The Friends and Family Plan,7,31 May 2013,"Greetings again from the darkness. There is always a bit of uncertainty when discussing or reviewing anything Star Trek related. So many rabid fans are more knowledgeable and keyed in to all the details. I am not. While I enjoyed the Gene Rodenberry TV series, and the subsequent movie versions, obsession never hit me. Because of this, my views will vary from those Trekkies and sci-fi experts.Director JJ Abrams re-invented the franchise in 2009 with stunning results. That ""new"" Enterprise crew returns here: Chris Pine as Kirk, Zachary Quinto as Spock, Karl Urban as Bones, Zoe Saldana as Uhura, John Cho as Sulu, Anton Yelchin as Chekov and Simon Pegg as Scotty. The new addition is Alice Eve as Carol, daughter of Admiral Marcus (played by RoboCop Peter Weller). Abrams is wise enough to know that this story needed a great villain so he revisits Khan and casts a spectacular Benedict Cumberbatch (the sleazy dude from Atonement).This movie works because of the crew's chemistry. We believe they like and respect each other ... even while breaking orders. The film works even better thanks to a villain that establishes a believable threat. Cumberbatch plays a super-human force with a mixture of Shakespeare and Hannibal Lecter. He delivers lines in a way that you have no cause to doubt his intent. This is a nice contrast to the warm fuzzies coming from the crew members.It can't go without mention that there is a shocking display of crystal blue eyes on display. Chris Pine, Peter Weller, Benedict Cumberbatch and Alice Eve all flash baby blues that jump off the screen in 3D. The only reason the sea blue peepers weren't more distracting is because of what I refer to as FXOD ... a special effects overdose. It seems as though each summer blockbuster feels the obligation to go bigger on the visual effects to get noticed. As often happens, the effects are just too much. Luckily, the characters and story are strong enough that it stayed on track.If you are a casual Star Trek fan, this is one that will entertain you. If you are a Trekkie, you have no doubt already seen it twice and have blogged about all the errors. Next up: 2016 for the third entry in the Abrams franchise.",Star Trek Into Darkness

With the new Picard series starting,and the film having sat in my ""to watch"" pile for years (!) I decided it was the right time to at last go into the darkness.View on the film:Falling to wipe away his Twitter history, co-writer/nutter Roberto Orci's ""Truther"" beliefs cast a foul smell across the new frontier. Hitting the opening with a ""blow back"" attack in a script co-written with fellow bumbling hacks Alex ""The Mummy"" Kurtzman and Damon ""Prometheus"" Lindelof (what a talented trio!) the writers set the timer off for Khan's arrival to be the thinnest ""allegorical"" facade for a 9/11 Truther.Entering the ""Deep State"" of Star Fleet keeping Section 31 in a normal looking government office building, the writers push the message hard that Admiral Marcus is the ""puppet-master"", pulling the strings of the savage warrior who did covert missions to help Starfleet prepare for war against the Soviets/"" Klingons"" /now has rebelled and is launching terrorist attacks for his 72 virg,I mean ""72 pod people"" Khan (yep,that's the subtly we're facing here.)Giving everyone on the Enterprise a lobotomy, the writers turn the ship to blindly follow ""Deep State"" Marcus to be used with Khan as a threat of war, leading to a utterly strange/thinly veiled re-enactment of the Gulf of Tonkin, whilst a stand-in for drone strikes takes place.When not indulging nut- job Orci's fight against ""Coincidence Theorists."", (the term he used for people who called him out, until Orci deleted his Twitter account in 2013-on September 11th yes, he really is full Truther)the writers use Spock's fists to pummel all humanism out of Star Trek. Ridding any chance of a discussion between the crew or different opinions on Khan to be express,The writers also decimate the heart/mind/soul dynamic of Bones/Kirk and Spock, by replacing characterisation, for mind-numbing, idiotic violent outbursts, leaving Bones mumbling on the sidelines, Spock seeing fists as the way to get his point across, and Kirk displaying no leadership/ thoughtfulness towards his crew, before he hands out what could be largely avoided violence.Fittingly locked in a glass cell like a second-rate Hannibal Lecter knock-off, Benedict Cumberbatch gives a incredibly poor performance as Khan, destroying the intrigue and calculating intelligence of Khan, in exchange for a naff panto act,where Benny pulls his lips and gurning each time he is meant to appear threatening.Opening by throwing the camera round like a volleyball and stating on The Daily Show ""I made this film for people who hate Star Trek"" (or those with half a brain-clearly)inept director Jar Jar Abrams continues his prat-fall adventures into Sci-Fi franchises, keeping the real ""Khan"" name from being seen on screen,in order to take Trek down to his Mystery Box level. (yo Jar Jar!, that shtick ""Lost"" any value years ago.)Out of his rotting Mystery Box, Jar Jar pulls out his poke 'em in the eye lens flair, thumping the camera on the ground like a basketball with jabbing, distracting flairs of red poking the viewer,and shoddy camera moves floating round with a inability to stop and allow moments for the Enterprise crew to be shown doing actual teamwork, in order for Jar Jar to dump Star Trek into a dark corner.",Star Trek Into Darkness

Abrams / Cast: Chris Pine, Zachary Quinto, Benedict Cumberbatch, Simon Pegg, Karl Urban: Excellent followup to J.J. Abrams's tremendous 2009 reboot. This one regards sacrifice or veering towards death. Captain Kirk is demoted when the Starship Enterprize is seen by a primitive culture on a distant planet. During a Starfleet meeting a traitor enacts an attack, which results in the death of many. Kirk is reunited as Captain with Spock as his first officer with orders to torpedo the Klingon planet where the traitor is hiding. The special effects are a huge payoff especially when the massive Starship Enterprize careens upon a future San Francisco. Chris Pine resembles a young William Shatner as Kirk who makes a big sacrifice for the good of others. Zachary Quinto plays the emotionless Spock who learns of emotions and also lands in a sacrificial position during the volcanic opening. Benedict Cumberbatch plays a great villain set to reunite with his fleet who are encased in these torpedoes. He appears to be somewhat super human and even assists the star fleet in a winning battle against Klingon soldiers. However he is revealed to be Khan and his motives are sinister despite his necessity to the crew during the crucial and rousing climax. Simon Pegg provides comic relief as Scotty who resigns his position but reinstates himself when his technical genius is needed. Karl Urban also reprises his role as medical officer Bones. Strictly entertainment at the highest level that boldly goes where the best Star Trek films have gone before. Score: 9 / 10",Star Trek Into Darkness

The revolter has detonated the fleet and everything it stands for, leaving earth in crisis. With a personal score to settle, Captain Kirk leads a manhunt to Klingon territory, to capture a one man weapon of mass destruction. As the crew are thrown into a game of life and death, loyalty will be challenged, friendships will be torn apart, and sacrifices must be made for the only thing Kirk has left.....The summer blockbusters are coming thick and fast already, and here in the UK, we are getting a little earlier than some countries, and I'm pleased to report its going to be worth waiting that little longer.This review is coming from a Non-Trekker or Trekkie, just a huge fan of film in general, and along with the first movie of the reboot franchise, this keeps up the pace and literally, the action is non-stop from beginning to end, maybe so the writers of the film can hide the plot holes just long enough so the audience can forgive them for a couple of days.To describe this film would be the sequel to the remake of the original, but also a prequel to the sequel of the original. The film is bonkers, granted, but by the time Nimoy comes on screen, you know that they are going back to Wrath territory and it just goes for broke, and succeeds.Pine and Quinto are the main focus a.gain here, and the tension between them is rife, hilarious sometimes, and heart touching in others. The rest of the crew are utilised very little, and Urban and Cho are sidelined somewhat compared to the last movie.Cumberbatch steals the movie though, his Khan is evil through and through, and the opening sequence involving a grieving Clarke, is just the tip of his evil plans.The film looks great, 3D isn't bothersome but makes the lens flare look cool, and the whole thing is just a fun romp, with reference to families, and sacrificing ones self to save the ones you love.And going back to the Wrath of Khan, the final act up until a certain point, mirrors the ending of Wrath, with a role reversal, but its predictable, due to a certain vial of blood being taken.At the end of the day, it is all style over substance, but its so shiny and good looking, you would really have to go out of your Way not to enjoy it.Really recommended.",Star Trek Into Darkness
28,phd_travel,Good story - you get quite a lot of movie,8,22 May 2013,Liked the plot even if didn't get all the twists about who is bad and who is good. The story goes in unexpected and interesting directions. Liked the use of the different characters especially Spock. Liked the futuristic cities that weren't too futuristic. The space battles are well done even if the Enterprise gets too much of a beating.Cumberbatch is usually too weird looking for human roles (Parade's End) and looks quite suitable in this movie as the villain. He makes gibberish sound convincing. Why there is a heavily British accented Alice Eve is a little out of place with the rest of the characters.Couple of things that need were a bit jarring though. Firstly Anton Yelchin's Russian accent is a bit exaggerated. Chris Pine is getting old rather rapidly. Better stay out of the sun and make the sequel soon.This isn't one of those let down sequels.,Star Trek Into Darkness
29,zetes,Extremely exciting,8,19 May 2013,"I had several major problems with J.J. Abrams first Star Trek movie. Just briefly, my big three complaints: it's too action-oriented, where Star Trek is supposed to be a little more philosophical; it moves too fast; they've really screwed up the character of James T. Kirk, and Chris Pine is by far the weakest actor in the movie. The sequel, unfortunately, retains most of those problems. I guess, though, that I've just come to accept that this is what a J.J. Abrams Star Trek movie is going to be like. The fact is, I quite enjoyed this film. The one major improvement is Pine's acting. He definitely seems more comfortable in the role. All the other actors, as with the previous installment, are excellent, particularly Zachary Quinto as Spock. This one also has stronger, more memorable villains than the previous installment (it was Eric Bana, I remember, but I don't recall what his deal was). The pace here is, again, breathless, but, for the most part, it's really well plotted. The action sequences are gripping as Hell, and the character work is so excellent it's all really involving. I definitely recommend this if you're at all interested.",Star Trek Into Darkness

On part of the story, clocking in over 2 hours there's never any boring moment. And the effects are really over the top. Just see the collision of a space ship into San Fransisco.

The first Star Trek had a certain synergy from discovering the new characters. The second instalment lacked the extra spark of the first instalment. What did work and made Into Darkness a good film is: Into the Darkness has great story and character development. Many parts of the film pay homage to earlier instalments with enough of a twist of not repeating the old story lines. If one looks at the script close enough the viewer experience the genius of the Kirk, Klingon war. Why the Kilngon's hate and respect Kirk and the same time is revealed with Into darkness. The introduction of the new Kahn character made for a strong film. Kahn is a true war machine in many ways. The viewer experiences how Kirk makes his own rules for a higher good. Logically, the Spock character provides a logical counter balance to Kirk's rational. The question of ethics, rules and good intentions versa consequences is a great theme for Into Darkness. I like Into Darkness which is an entertaining film. I give the second instalment a seven out of ten.",Star Trek Into Darkness
32,Mr-Fusion,"Abrams, just make a Star Wars movie, already.",3,23 May 2013,"My disappointment comes not from being a disillusioned Trekkie (would I even qualify for that?) but from the nice bit of Summer escapism that never panned out. Abrams' ""Star Trek Into Darkness"" bursts onto the screen, guns blazing. It's a flashy, loud, sensory barrage that never lets up; like a fistful of speed pills on the big screen. Sometimes this attitude works, mostly it doesn't, and I often wished Abrams would stop moving the damn camera (one static shot here or there won't kill you, man). It's dizzying.One of the problems is that there is a staggering amount of story material for one movie. They tease a war with the Klingons, touch on terrorism (9/11, you know it), play with the idea of making the now-non-wheelchair-ridden Admiral Pike the captain of the Enterprise again, there's a lover's quarrel between Spock and Uhura, Kirk learns some hard lessons (or maybe he doesn't, we're not sure), and then there's John Harrison, the terrorist bad guy - no wait, the bad guy's Peter Weller - oh, OK, it's really Harrison. Who's really Khan. Why?The writers of ""Star Trek Into Darkness"" might have had something if they weren't so concerned with ""Star Trek: The Wrath of Khan"". It looms large over everything in this movie. Every repurposed line, every recycled plot point, they're all reminders that I could be watching a much better movie, instead. Orci, Kurtzman and Lindelof are too happy remixing the lore without respecting it. Why the big reveal that Harrison is Khan? Harrison was a good enough bad guy character in his own right, with his own motivation. Better than Nero, and good enough to stand on his own. And why would Spock Prime be consulted on this guy if the Cumberbatch and Montalban characters are apples and oranges? Why kill off Kirk if he's just going to be resurrected before end credits? We already know there's magical blood to fix him; it just cheapens a (well-acted, at least) death scene. I have to stop here, because the list will seem like nitpicks. But it also means that because of these constant callbacks, ""Into Darkness"" never gets the chance to stand as its own movie. It's the uninspired writing that steeps this movie in mediocrity, and that's what's most disappointing. The filmmakers are too interested in reexamining, deconstructing, and rehashing the past, instead of taking us somewhere new. Nod, don't pilfer.I want the imagination back. 3/10",Star Trek Into Darkness
33,siderite,A lot better than I expected,9,19 May 2013,"I really thought it was going to be a shallow macho story with lots of action and no depth. And, in many a respect, it was so. But I didn't hate it. I had fun all the way, liked the characters, liked the casting and Benedict Cumberbatch made a fantastic Khan. The 3D wasn't really impressive and I guess, seen in old fashioned 2D, it would not have lost any of the watching pleasure.If I have to dislike something it is the exaggerated action scenes and the obvious humour. In a world of high technology and science, there is a lot of hand to hand combat, punching and then some silly jokes to lighten the mood. However, that is consistent to the original Star Trek series, so I can't complain too much. I really would have liked Scotty to be a little more serious. Even if Simon Pegg is a comedy actor, I am sure he can do something more than comic relief in an action movie.My conclusion: amazingly fun, but then I went there with low expectations to begin with. I am a bit preoccupied that they are moving away from the ideas of The Next Generation to wallow in the more base concepts of The Original Series, but overall I liked the movie.",Star Trek Into Darkness

35,DKosty123,Crossroads of a Movie Franchise,6,12 September 2013,"After finally watching this one, this movie seems like a cross between Star Wars special effects, Fringe Science, and the original Star Trek Franchise. The most surprising thing is the quick cameo by Lenard Nimoy as he is retired the last I heard but this might have been done before he did. As an original Trekkie, I am distraught in how the story line is getting blurred beyond recognition.The writers appear to like trying to reverse previous scripts too. In more than one sequence they reverse scenes between Spock and Kirk from how the same things were done in previous films. That is more like film flam than actual creative writing. The actor playing the young Spock is by far the most impressive in the cast. The new Kirk seems to be getting away from the original one who always had a answer to worm out of an impossible situation. This one appears to be less the equal of Spock and more the inferior in this script.The new Khan is ruthless and one dimensional fanatic, which is totally different than the original one- dumbed down indeed. Script is without a doubt the problem with the movie.It is entertaining, because of the CGI. The last half hour of the film seems to try and Salute Gene Roddenbury but because of the blurring of the plot line in time and space, Gene would spin in his grave with the writing here. They still express his message but in doing so they lose the complex message he tried to convey.Back to the drawing board might be the best way to term this. Bad Robot indeed but an active robot whose battery has yet to run out, but needs a script writing recharge.",Star Trek Into Darkness
36,lasttimeisaw,Star Trek Into Darkness,7,2 September 2013,"I'm not a trekkie, and my first Star Trek film is the reboot STAR TREK (2009, 7/10), as a momentous pioneer to boost a whole new generation to embrace a revamped Sci-Fi franchise, it did a decent job thanks to J.J. Abrams' cachet in the category and the recurring hyped-up references from the soap sensation THE BIG BANG THEORY. 4 years later, the second installment finally arrives as a leviathan summer blockbuster as its predecessor, the Enterprise's new intergalactic adventure takes off with the entire crew members back under the J.J. Abrams' helm, this time holding the villain name tag is the red-hot Benedict Cumberbatch, sports a dashing windbreaker, frowns while practices his merciless slaughter, hardly a novel creation, but he does invigorate the tension by delivering his spiteful lines with Bardic cadence.Once again, the same bad-guy-(willingly)-being-caught-in-the-middle-of-the-film trope bears the importance as a game-changing twist, then after a spate of nifty but anticipated internal hazards and warp chase, the final battle returns to earth for a bland point-blank hand-to-hand combat. Most obtrusively, Kirk and Spock's bromance has been handily elevated into another Platonic level, the near-death confession scenes overtly suggests it will exist as an unerring theme in the whole running, it is embarrassing to see the almost zero chemistry between Spock and Uhura, even for a dispassionate Vulcan, the innuendo is quite palpable, only Kirk can melt Spock's cold- hearted veneer and illicit his human part of being dramatic, impulsive and vengeful. Sidekicks are the same old story, Simon Pegg is entrusted to assume as the saviors at least twice, apart from his usual levity to induce laughters. Newcomer Alice Eve offers a gratuitous bikini scene in the wink of an eye, which awkwardly belies the rashness to cater to the film's core ticket-or- DVD-buyers (geeky nerds mostly), which is a clumsy and paltry strategy.The visual effect has its glorious achievement in some section, but there is a dearth of awe- inspiring imagination to outdo the ruck of Hollywood tentpoles. Much appreciation should be impute to the polished editing and narrative pace, the film seldom slackens to a dull moment for viewers to think twice about its logical practicality of the deeds involved. If it is not entirely appealing to audiences from all strata, at the minimum, trekkies will not cold-shoulder it and most likely, it is a qualified sequel to spur the vitality for another Star Trek binge in the near future. But an apprehensive concern is that since J.J. Abrams has embarked on to reinstate the more preeminent STAR WARS brand, I sincerely hope a new director will bring a paradigm shift for its third venture, it should not perpetually be overshadowed as a spin-off or a cheaper version of the former (at least the characters are more interesting and dynamic), what's more, it is anything but cheap gauging by its production budget, it has everything to challenge the elephant in the room now!",Star Trek Into Darkness

38,KineticSeoul,Not as satisfying as the first one but still worth seeing on the big screen,7,20 June 2013,"Because of the first one this became one of the most anticipated summer sequel. And for the most part it met my expectation, although a bit flawed. Usually the second installment is the one that really brings out what a movie like this is all about. Since the build up is done with the first installment, now it's about how the good guys utilize what they have to fight against the bad guys. Without much in the way of showing it. Since it's usually the third installment that tries to go grand-scale and sometimes even conclude the story. And a lot of times it has a stand out enemy for the good guys to battle, which this one most definitely has. However despite it having fan service and a lot of cool battles and tactics going for it. I just didn't find it as absorbing as the first one. It's however more focused on the bond between Kirk and Spock, with more strategic battle tactics and a arch-nemesis that is not only smarter intellectually but physically stronger. And is a very difficult opponent even with the whole starship fleet combined. Benedict Cumberbatch is just awesome as Khan who is a real formidable opponent for the whole starship fleet. Overall this is a entertaining and exciting summer sequel that is worth seeing on the big screen despite it having a story that isn't all that well interwoven and just isn't as satisfying as the first one.7.9/10",Star Trek Into Darkness
39,sddavis63,This Just Seemed Off To Me - Really Off,3,14 September 2013,"I love Star Trek. I've watched pretty much every television incarnation of it. Some I've enjoyed more than others, but I've watched them. I've seen all of the movies. I know Star Trek, in other words. This didn't seem like Star Trek. It was off; it was wrong. It was for the most part little more than a pretty standard action movie that tried to pass itself off as Star Trek by using the Star Trek characters. But it wasn't Star Trek. At best, there were times when it seemed to be almost a spoof of Star Trek. It wasn't something I could take seriously, and I'm not sure what those responsible for this movie were really thinking of and trying to accomplish. Frankly, I also can't figure out the title. Into what ""darkness""?I found the plot both pretty standard action fare, and also convoluted and lacking any real direction. There was no philosophical underpinning to this, which is often what made Star Trek worth watching. It's about a criminal/terrorist who attacks Star Fleet headquarters, with the Enterprise being sent off in pursuit, only to discover a massive bit of cover-up and corruption way up at the top. In the end, as the massive ""enemy ship"" readies to collide with Star Fleet headquarters there's a certain 9/11 feel to this. Honestly - couldn't they have done something more original?Khan Noonian Singh? Again? Really? Yes, ""Space Seed"" was one of the best episodes of the original ""Star Trek"" TV series. Yes, ""Star Trek II: The Wrath Of Khan"" was definitely one of the best of the Star Trek franchise of movies to date. But - Khan Noonian Singh? Again? Really? This is kind of the equivalent of ""Next Generation Trek"" milking the Borg way too far for them to be either really interesting or really scary. And did we really need the bit of role reversal as the movie reached its ""climax"" - with dialogue being lifted in some cases word for word from ""Star Trek II"" but the roles of Spock and Kirk interchanged? That all just says to me that no one really put a great deal of thought into this. It was a muddle of things that are already very familiar thrown together (there's even a tribble in this!) with no particular coherence to them. And did we really need Leonard Nimoy? Again? I loved Leonard Nimoy as Mr. Spock. But - really - if you're going to try to keep this going (and there's another movie planned apparently, without J.J. Abrams directing) it's time to move on. You know. To boldly go where no one has gone before. Without Leonard Nimoy. Really. The whole Spock Prime thing serves no purpose whatsoever. Let Nimoy go. He's been honoured sufficiently.I've not much to say about the cast. The movie was so centred on action that the cast didn't stand out. They faded into the background behind the action itself and the special effects.I'll watch the next one. I mean, I watched ""Star Trek VI"" even after the disaster that was ""Star Trek V."" But, please, make it better. Show some thought. Be creative. Do all the things that weren't done for this one. (3/10)",Star Trek Into Darkness
40,Hellmant,The movie delivers almost everything die-hard Trekkies and movie buffs want!,9,17 May 2013,"'STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Current Sci-fi king J.J. Abrams returns to direct the second installment in the 'STAR TREK' reboot/alternate universe series (and twelfth 'STAR TREK' movie) 'INTO DARKNESS'. It's sort of a loose remake of 'STAR TREK II: THE WRATH OF KHAN' but due to the fact that a time traveling Romulan, with a vengeance, changed the entire 'STAR TREK' universe in the last film things of course happen differently this time around. The new Kirk (Chris Pine), Spock (Zachary Quinto) and the rest of the Enterprise crew are back to battle a genetically engineered super being (Benedict Cumberbatch), with a vengeance of course (against all of Starfleet). Other new additions to the cast include Peter Weller (one of my favorite actors) and Alice Eve (of 'SHE'S OUT OF MY LEAGUE' fame). Abrams produced the film with his long time buddy and partner in crime, Damon Lindelof, as well as the first film's writers (and other frequent Abrams conspirators) Robert Orci and Alex Kurtzman. Orci and Kurtzman once again wrote the script, this time with Lindelof (one of the greatest film and TV writers there is) as well. Michael Giacchino (who does the music for all of Abrams' movies and TV shows) once again did a breathtaking score for the film as well. The movie delivers almost everything die-hard Trekkies and movie buffs want; but for me it didn't quite live up to it's predecessor or the original classic ('THE WRATH OF KHAN') it's trying to emulate (it does beat all other films in the series hands down though).After narrowly escaping death and saving the primitive people of the planet Nibiru from extinction Captain James T. Kirk (Pine) returns home to Earth to find he's been demoted for being a hotshot loose cannon, once again, and not following Starfleet's Prime Directives. Admiral Pike (Bruce Greenwood once again) replaces him as captain of the Enterprise and Spock (Quinto) is reassigned to another ship. But when a genetically engineered former member of Starfleet, by the name of John Harrison (Cumberbatch), bombs a Starfleet installation in London and attacks a secret meeting at Starfleet Command Kirk is reassigned to Captain of the Enterprise in order to carry out a revenge attack on Harrison (who they learn is hiding out on the Klingon home planet Kronos). Spock is once again assigned to the Enterprise as well and questions Admiral Marcus's (Weller) motives for giving Kirk 72 torpedoes to kill Harrison with, without a trial. Kirk, Spock and the others soon learn there's much more going on than they originally thought as a possible war with the Klingons could result from their actions and there could be corruption among high ranking Starfleet officials.The movie is brilliant in how it incorporates current politics into it's plot and overall message but that's what 'STAR TREK' has always been well known for. As opposed to 'STAR WARS', 'STAR TREK' has always been thought of as the more thinking man's science fiction (I prefer 'STAR WARS' though and disagree with this assessment; I'm also not a Trekkie). With the films (and especially these last two installments) the franchise has grown more and more towards action and spectacle but the thing that Abrams has always been good at is not losing sight of what's most important (the film's characters, heart and themes). This movie is probably the most action packed and visually stunning one yet but it still does have a lot of character development, drama and political ideas. The drama does feel a little more forced this time around though and while the action is exhilarating the movie is not nearly as much fun as being reintroduced to all these characters was last time around (it's also just not as classic as 'WRATH OF KHAN'). While the movie is still a great action film, and stunning sci-fi enjoyment, it disappoints (just a little) by not living up to the two greatest 'STAR TREK' movies. This was perhaps an impossible feat though and Abrams is still one of hottest directors around (he's now in charge of both of the most popular science fiction franchises in history; being given the opportunity to direct the next 'STAR WARS' film as well). This is still an amazing film and is about as much as one could possibly ask for or expect.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ge23zs5RPrM",Star Trek Into Darkness
41,Buddy-51,Less cerebral than most but with strong action scenes,7,5 November 2013,"Though it lacks the profundity and depth traditionally associated with the brand, ""Star Trek: Into Darkness,"" the twelfth installment in the movie series, has enough rip-roaring adventure and jaw-dropping visual effects to make it a satisfying experience for the action-oriented moviegoer.In this sequel to the prequel that successfully re-booted the series in 2009 (both directed by J.J. Abrams), some initially unknown terrorist (Benedict Cumberbatch) has begun targeting the leaders of Starfleet, and it is up to the Enterprise and her crew to root him out of his hiding place deep inside enemy Klingon territory.Thanks to the screenplay by Roberto Orci, Alex Kurtzman and Damon Lindelof, there's the same spirited verbal jousting between Captain Kirk (Chris Pine) and Commander Spock (Zachary Quinto) over the issue of feelings-vs.-rationality that's been going on for decades now, along with a bit of a discussion about the needs of the individual vs. the greater good, as well as about whether the Enterprise should become involved with military conflict instead of just space exploration. But, for the most part, this is a straight-ahead action movie and, as such, it unquestionably delivers the goods. Indeed, there are some truly astonishing action scenes leading up to one through the skies of a 23rd Century San Francisco that has to be seen to be believed - even if believability is never really the prime factor in films of this type.",Star Trek Into Darkness
42,thesar-2,IIb or Not IIb,6,19 May 2013,"I guess the secret(s) are out. When IMDb reports major film spoilers just in the credits, it's safe to say: few surprises are left with Star Trek Into Darkness.But, that doesn't mean I have to (or will) spoil anything. The fun for me was finding out the few surprises along the way, enjoying some new twists and reminiscing about the Star Trek film franchise's past. Sort of past, that is.The movie looked gorgeous and mercifully, Abrams scaled back tenfold on the lens flares. I'll pause for a minute. I never actually noticed them until I heard a few (dozen) complaints about the overuse of them in the 2009 film. Recently, while getting hyped for this, I revisited that film and I can see now with open eyes. Or sore eyes; there had to be 300 of them! Here, in 2013, he's learned his lesson. For the most part, anyways.Aside from the great cinematography and special effects that went hand-in-hand, the score was rich, though not as great as the 2009 tracks. But, in contrast, the actors really became their roles and were much more fleshed out, with the exception of Uhura, than the previous installment.Unfortunately, the problems I had, though few, were big enough for me not to escape. The plot staggered and never felt completed. The movie seemed to be all over the place at points and left enough black hole sized wrongs that I could not ignore. To state them would be the spoiler I advised I would not share. Also, the pacing was far off at points and the movie certainly went on much longer than it should have. And finally, the villain was just incrediblyblah. I will simply not compare this villain to the one everyone whose seen this knows who I'm referring to, but that other villain was ten times the character that Benedict Cumberbatch played here.Despite the step downs from the ""original"" 2009 near-masterpiece, the movie is a lot of fun and absolutely funny, thanks to Bones and Scotty. The movie also has a huge amount of heart at points, especially one scene towards the (overly long) finale that I couldn't help but choke up at.Jim Kirk has since settled in his role as the Enterprise captain and is trying his best to make sure everyone knows he doesn't follow the rules – any rule, that is, when a new threat emerges in the form of one strong male. Apparently, this one villain can take on the entire Star Fleet without any assistance. But, luckily, we have plenty of disposable and expendable officers to attempt to match this one bad guy.Along the way, we get more depth of the bromance between Kirk and Spock and that's a lot of fun. We get some absolute laugh-out-loud moments, terrific battles, a whole lot of people running all over the place and an unwelcomed/overused cameo.So, as you can tell, from every couple of positives I find, more equally puzzling and negative opinions. That said, it did range above the 5-star dead even average to 6 stars out of 10.I think it's going to be a must-see on BluRay. And repeatedly, until the (hopefully more fleshed out) Part III hits theatres.",Star Trek Into Darkness
43,cherold,"mindless fun, but should have been much better",7,13 September 2013,"While I enjoyed the original Star Trek series, I never had the enthusiasm for it required to really hate this movie. I don't have a problem with anything in the movie based on how it differs from the series, but I do have problems with this movie as a big dumb action flick.First off, this is very much a blow-stuff-up movie. There is very little story and a bare minimum of character development. This is not a movie of ideas. The series took on various issues and explored mankind's place in the world, the movie hasn't a thought in its head.As a dumb action picture, Darkness succeeds pretty well. It's got some exciting action. It also has moments of humor, along with failed moments of pathos.But the movie can't be satisfied with being dumb, but instead insists on being aggressively stupid. For example, Kirk is repeatedly told he is too impetuous, trying crazy, dangerous things. All evidence is that this is true, yet the movie justifies every decision he makes, holding up impetuous recklessness as a higher calling. This is not untrue to the series - Kirk was always ludicrously perfect - but it's dumb.The really dumb stuff turns up at the end. There's a scene that's supposed to be touching (and is apparently a replay of a scene from an older ST movie I barely remember), but it fails, both because the nature of the movie excludes true tragedy and because the character work needed to make the scene work is never done. This is soon followed up by a plot hole so huge and obvious that one has to conclude the writers and director knew it was there and just decided to ignore it, because, HEY LOOK OVER THERE! WE'RE BLOWING STUFF UP!While not as bad as Abrams' Mission Impossible 3, a similarly dumb and explosive film, Darkness is still too CGI-obsessed to be really good. It's a disappointing follow-up to his first, better attempt at Star Trek, but considering its success, I expect Abrams will prove content to blow stuff up and let the money roll in.",Star Trek Into Darkness
44,Robert_duder,Sheer brilliance! Abram's Star Trek might be the best flick of the summer,9,27 May 2013,"When Abram's rebooted Star Trek he had perhaps the most uphill battle ahead of him of any director...ever. Millions of the most die hard, obsessive and fastidious fans ever would be staring at him. For many...he ticked them off there is no doubt. However, for most he knocked it out of the park! The first film was a brilliant sci-fi epic reboot. How would a second outing fare? Well let me tell you...JJ Abrams has set a standard of Sci-Fi action that few others will ever touch. But beyond that the film sets a standard for action films and summer blockbusters. Into Darkness is a riveting, brilliant, adrenaline fuelled masterpiece. The characters that we all love are given such a range and when you think it couldn't leave you on the edge of your seat anymore, it does again and again. The film gives us an incredible villain that is so vital to a film like this. The special effects, much like the first one, were absolutely bang on. CGI can be so tricky and completely overused and even worse done poorly but Into Darkness is breathtaking to look at and the CGI and special effects are very near flawless. Every time you see the Enterprise it is epic and just awe inspiring.Chris Pine returns as the iconic Captain Kirk. He is absolutely a different Captain Kirk than Shatner and that's a good thing. He is a star and his charisma on screen is perfect. His hero is a flawed one and makes many mistakes but is always first there to the rescue. Pine carries the film effortlessly. I'm sure I raved about him in the review for the first film but Zachary Quinto is amazing. As far as I'm concerned this was an Oscar worthy performance from him and I truly mean that. His Spock is so brilliant and captures the essence of the iconic Leonard Nimoy while making his own mark on the character. Spock has such an incredible and emotional arc in this film and Quinto is brilliant at it. The chemistry between him and Pine is near perfect. The whole Enterprise crew returns once again. Its just incredible that Abrams or whomever cast this film was able to find a group of people that work so well together. Not only do they work well together but they completely embody these characters that we were created so long ago and are so iconic. They pay a respectful homage to those original characters and create a whole new persona as well. Zoe Saldana, Karl Urban, Simon Pegg, John Cho and Anton Yelchin are amazing in their roles. The film does a great job at balancing everyone as equally as possible so that everyone can find their favourite character. Bruce Greenwood also returns in a cameo type role as Pike but a very important character and he's great as well. It was a pleasure to see Peter Weller in a major supporting role. He is a terrific adversary to Kirk and the guy just looks villainous. This is certainly one of his best roles in a very long time. Alice Eve is also a new addition to the cast and the one very big downside to this cast. I have said many times before in reviews that Alice Eve is gorgeous...I have a huge crush on the girl, however...she isn't a great actress. She tries hard enough but I have yet to see her in anything impressive. Her character is unnecessary in the film and she sticks out amongst the cast. And finally we have perhaps the best performance hands down is by Benedict Cumberbatch. Now, the spoilers of who he is has been dredged all over the internet and ticked off legions of fans. I won't specifically do that again. But he is a villain and an incredible one at that. His presence on screen is epic and perfect and one of the best villains I've seen in a very long time! Abrams rebooting of this franchise making back to back blockbusters like this makes him one of the best directors in my books. It makes me feel completely confident for Star Wars. In the first film I think he paid a very respectable homage to the original content. This is coming from a non-Trekkie but I am still learning about the little Easter Eggs from that first film. Now with his one, he upped that ante and paid such incredible respect to the original series. The entire scene near the end of the film with Kirk and Spock was done in such an incredibly moving and well done way. Obviously it is hard for people to go into this without astronomical expectations, especially die hard fans but I encourage everyone to go and see this and have fun because this is the type of summer Blockbuster to be thrilled over!! I go with my gut and for me this was near perfectly executed. 9/10",Star Trek Into Darkness
45,Lejink,Fading star,4,9 March 2014,"What I found interesting about this second entry in the relaunch of ""Star Trek"" with the original characters is that it seemed to take us up right to the start of the original TV series, indicating to me that there may be nowhere further for the adventure to go. Of course I'll be proved wrong, but I did find this latest exercise in reheating an old soufflé somewhat unsatisfying.There seemed to be little new here either in terms of characterisation or plot development and for me anyway the appeal of recognising young actors playing their antecedents didn't work a second time. Familiarity breeds contempt as we get the same callow, randy young Kirk from the film before, likewise the crusty, loyal McCoy, mischievous but half-demented Scotty and of course the brave but emotionless Spock. Benedict ""Sherlock"" Cumberbatch is introduced as Khan and while he brings an angular physicality to the part, he lacks the scheming exoticism of Ricardo Montalban's original. While I liked some of the fidelity shown to previous story-lines, in particular the reversal of the dying Kirk with a helpless Spock on the outside contrasting the ""Wrath of Khan"" climax, I just don't get the Spock / Uhuru pairing at all or the reinvention of Kirk's mentor Christopher Pike when we Trekkies know he lived to escape ""The Cage"" rather than meet his end here.Unsurprisingly and disappointingly too, there's some eye candy for the boys thrown in, in the form of the Admiral's pretty blonde daughter who inveigles herself on board and pretty soon afterwards discards her clothes, just to confirm who the real target audience is here. And really, Leonard Nimoy's cameos are becoming as irritating as Stan Lee's in every Marvel movie made.The effects are fine if a bit much at times. The never-ending climactic fight between Khan and Spock seemed unoriginal too with both combatants naturally surviving murderous attacks on the other ad infinitum.I think I've come to the conclusion that this reincarnation of the old Enterprise crew just maybe isn't for me, just as it didn't for ""Star Wars"". These are great characters but the main reason I identify with them is through the original actors and actually consider these lightweight re-interpretations to be no real substitute. The thing is these kids are going where others have gone before and better. Time to beam me up, Scotty!",Star Trek Into Darkness
46,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,Long awaited follow up film that keeps the series floating for a new generation,9,1 June 2013,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningAfter a perilous mission on the planet Niburu, where Captain Kirk (Chris Pine) is reckless in saving the life of Spock (Zachary Quinto), the two once again find themselves at odds when Spock reveals some truths about Kirk's fabrications. But they find themselves thrust back together again when embittered ex Starfleet officer Khan (Benedict Cumberbatch) launches a one man reign of terror.Despite following the current trend of resurrecting an old franchise and making it in to a marketable new series, J.J. Abrams has spaced out (no pun intended) his follow up to his 2009 re-generation of the series, preferring to keep the fans in suspense following that film's critical and commercial success. And he proves that taking one's time and not being too quick to make a quick buck on the back of a winning horse works wonders with this solid, satisfying second instalment that should prove worthwhile to mega fans and more casual trekkers alike.Abrams takes a no dawdling approach, starting as he means to go on with a thrilling chase sequence on the planet Niburu, with Kirk and an associate finding themselves being chased by some scary inhabitants with white, bold heads. From here on in, he maintains a steady pace, never letting things drag on for too long until the next action spectacular. The tone never gets too heavy or serious either, with tongue firmly in cheek most of the time. The 'Into Darkness' suffix feels misplaced, given the film's more light hearted feel compared to the original's dark, brooding style. That's not to say darker, more serious subject matter is not explored, as the film is another modern blockbuster that isn't afraid to tap in to current affairs that have everyone on edge, such as terrorist attacks and concealed intelligence. The film respects the audience's intelligence and expects it to do the same.Performances wise, Pine and Quinto ane still a cracking mismatched buddy buddy act, Pine an eager Martin Riggs to Quinto's Roger Murtaugh, while a support cast including Simon Pegg, Alice Eve and Robocop himself Peter Weller add class. But the stand out personality is Cumberbatch as the villain, effortlessly owning his screen time and chewing the scenery with his dark, foreboding presence as the villain. To top things off, Abrams lets another Brit boy have a crack at the big time, with Noel Clarke in a supporting (but still very noticeable) role as an ill fated man.Abrams has figured out how to make this old franchise appeal to a modern audience, and ensures the length is never a drag and the action never lets up. ****",Star Trek Into Darkness
47,bowmanblue,The posh of Khan,9,3 February 2015,"Star Trek: Into Darkness pretty much continues where the 2009 reboot took off. It's hard to imagine there are too many people watching Into Darkness who don't know what to expect. This film is very 'JJ Abrams,' i.e. it's full of flashy computer special effects and even more flashy lens flares.However, if you can look past the polish then you'll find that there's actually a pretty involving story behind it. The actors - once again - put in excellent performances, imitating their 'older' incarnations perfectly (some even getting better the second time around - Simon Pegg as 'Scotty' being the main improvement). There's plenty of room for character development as the film is over two hours long as Kirk and co take on John Harrison (aka a new British (?) 'Khan') who has sworn to destroy the Federation.You don't actually need to have seen the last big screen outing where Kirk and Khan squared off. However, if you have seen 'Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan' then you'll probably enjoy watching how the 'tangent universe' we're now watching, mirrors the old Star Trek universe.The best thing about both new Star Trek films is that they both retain their 'Star Trek feel,' even with updated special effects. You would probably never confuse these movies with any from the Star Wars franchise. The new Trek movies play to their strengths, rather than try to imitate Star Wars.Perhaps the only criticism may be that 'we've seen this all before.' But that would most likely be from those of us who watched the Star Trek films the first time round. Yes, some bits feel a little too recycled, but there's definitely enough that's original here to make this an excellent, high-budget action movie which should - hopefully - appeal to long-standing and new fans alike.",Star Trek Into Darkness
48,dromasca,the thrill is gone,6,3 June 2015,"J.J. Abrams uses in 'Star Trek: Into Darkness' the prequels formula Reversing the effects of present-past and discovering the causes of the effects we have known in advance have paved the interest for many films. In the first film we already met Captain James T. Kirk as a young rebel, Mr. Spock who already has all the traits of his humano-volcanic character, while doctor Chekhov and technician Scotty play an important role in the plot the second series.The world is again in danger in this series and the main villain Benedict Cumberbatch is played masterfully by an actor that I like enormously and in this film manages to be a 'bad guy' of high quality. Themes popular in the 'Star Trek' series like the moral dilemmas between friendship and duty, love between humans and humanoids from other species of the universe, the principle of non-intervention in exploration, namely the avoidance of disruption of the historical evolution of less developed civilizations, are added to a contemporary theme in this film - that of terrorism. The HQ of the Federation Council which extends the UN replacing or in some way by the Organization of United Civilizations is the victim of a terrorist attack in London of the future, and hence complicates the start and the multiple threads of the main action in the film.What is probably to be criticized in J.J. Abrams and the producers work in this second series 'Star Trek' is the fact that space action is given undue overweight. It is natural for a science fiction film made in 2013 to look very different than a television series conceived in the mid 60s. Cinematic technology progressed, taste of a public that has seen so many in nearly half a century of films changed. Yet it seemed to me that the filmmakers have chosen the superficial entertainment path and personally I missed the thrill of exploring knowledge and that was evident in many of the Star Trek TV series and movies from the past. The focus is too much on graphics (exceptional, actually), the image of the future metropolis, the space battles and chases occupying about half the film. This Star Trek's J.J. Abrams looks too much like Star Wars. Technology of the future imagined by Abrams brings little additional elements to what we knew from previous series - 'transporters', communication systems etc. we are familiar with these, with the sole exception of the levitation beds in hospitals. The atmosphere of 'Star Trek' is found rather in small dialogs between characters who continue to build and define the next generation and become familiar to the public. It is probably one of the reasons the film's success and a good premise for the series that will follow.The journey continues, but the pace is hesitant, and the thrill is gone. Hopefully, only temporarily.",Star Trek Into Darkness
49,ThomasDrufke,Evil Awakens,8,21 July 2016,"Though it feels much more like a Star Wars film than anything Star Trek has ever done, 'Into Darkness' succeeds in most of the areas in sets out to, even if it wasn't the general direction most Trekkies wanted the series to go after a brilliant reboot in 2009.Most of the scrutiny from the film comes from its handling of the character, Spock, and the unnecessary hiding of him for the entire marketing campaign. While the ladder is a fair criticism, it doesn't have anything to do with the quality of the film. Though I can understand a particular third act plot choice that felt like a forced homage to 1982's The Wrath of Khan, this rendition of Khan is still well realized. Most of the credit there should go to the relentless performance from Benedict Cumberbatch. Not as flashy nor as memorable as Ricardo Montalban's Khan, Cumberbatch is far more brutal and deceptive. Even on repeat viewing, I found myself captivated by every scene with Khan, especially those which also involved Kirk and/or Spock. There's something about the dialogue between them that feels vintage good vs evil while also presenting such a tremendous amount of gravitas as well.J.J. Abrams is a genius filmmaker, but I don't think he gets enough credit for what he did with both his Trek films. The series was nearly dead before he came aboard and revamped and refreshed the entire idea of what a Trek film is. Even if it deviates from lore, 'Into Darkness' is a really well made film. The effects have never been better and the way Abrams seamlessly takes us from a CGI or green screen landscape into an integral one on one dialogue battle is very impressive.Though not every key emotional moment feels earned in the third act, it's nice seeing all of the actors start to come into their own as the respected crew members of the Enterprise. Scotty has never been better, Sulu gets more than enough time to shine, Quinto brought a new layer to Spock not seen in 2009, and Chris Pine feels much more like an heir apparent to William Shatner than he did in the first entry. To me, it was much easier to care about the characters this time around.With all this said, there's plenty that I wish the film did differently. The Khan reveal and 3rd act mishandle of the infamous moment are just some of the mishaps that could have been fixed. Or even the entire subplot with the Admirals daughter, but I digress. 'Into Darkness' is a far better film than it probably has a right to be with a fun and exciting direction from Abrams and lively performances from the good and bad side of the coin.+Cumberbatch+Abrams directing style+Great dialogue between Kirk, Khan, and Spock-3rd act mishaps8.2/10",Star Trek Into Darkness
50,g-bodyl,Fantastic Sequel to a Fantastic Reboot!,10,11 September 2014,"When the reboot of Star Trek was released in 2009, I was one of the many who heralded the film. Not being interested in the series at all, I was turned into a fan. Now the sequel has arrived and I went it thinking the director J.J Abrams would not be able to outdo himself. Boy was I ever wrong. Star Trek Into Darkness once again excels by acting as a true sci-fi film that is bound together to the core by the early Star Trek fundamentals, but is action-packed and visually stunning enough to satisfy non-Trekkies and the average movie-goer.Abrams's return to the U.S.S Enterprise is a very successful one as it takes place one year after the events of the reboot. After a terrorist attack by the mysterious John Harrison, Kirk, Spock, and the rest of the crew embark on a mission to the Klingon world in order to return Harrison to Earth. But this mission may dig deeper than everyone would have thought.Most of the cast returns to this film and they are excellent as always. Chris Pine really matures as Kirk, but he is able to maintain his lovable goofball personality. Zachary Quinto is excellent as Spock, who never seems to lighten up. Pine and Quinto show fantastic chemistry and they even have a scene together that touched my heart. Benedict Cumberbatch makes one hell of a villain mainly not because he is menacing, but we can feel some sympathy towards him. The rest of the cast featuring Zoe Saldana, Bruce Greenwood, Simon Pegg, and Karl Urban were very good and truly supplemented the main characters.Overall, Star Trek Into Darkness is one of the rare sequels that is better than the original. It has a slightly darker tone, but that doesn't stop the film from offering up a few jokes from time to time. The action is spectacular and so are the visuals and the production design. The world they were in at the beginning is just a tiny example of the technical mastery of the film. While staying true to the deeper meanings of Star Trek, Abrams created a product that enlightens Trekkies and non-Trekkies alike. I rate this film 10/10.",Star Trek Into Darkness
51,cricketbat,Not as fun as its predecessor,6,21 September 2018,"Star Trek Into Darkness is a fun movie, but not as fun as its predecessor. There are some major flaws in this film, not the least of which is a stubborn pacifistic stance that results in the loss of hundreds of lives. Most of the movie focuses on an eternally immature Kirk and a bland Spock, while skimping on a fantastic villain played by Benedict Cumberbatch. Plus, the movie spends too much time winking at the Trekkies in the audience. Let's hope they've gotten all of that out of their system for the next movie.",Star Trek Into Darkness

56,tabuno,"Durivative, Predictable, and Somewhat Boring",5,17 January 2019,"18 May 2013. Whereas this movie version of the ""iconic"" Star Trek has received mostly positive reviews and insistence that its twists are not to be revealed, perhaps for that reason that this movie depends on such ""surprises"" to make this movie watchable, at least to survive through a first showing. The movie is derivative with little originality in its contents or storyline, and interestingly it is the very nature of the ""secretive"" plot that only reveals how repetitive, predictable, that his movie is essentially a rehash of old plot lines and cliques in its attempt to forge through on its special effects and what eventually becomes nauseating sound bites.The movie begins with the now to be expected old traditional, James Bond movie sequence with its loads of action thrills that are intended to spellbind. The rest of the movie uses the audience psychological sales marketing plot points that began primarily with Jaws (1975) that inserted the requisite emotional and ethical conflict scene, the relational confrontation scene, the rebellion scene and the take pity scene, regret scene, and of course loads of action scenes that are needed to supposedly enhance the 3-D experience which only added mildly to the visceral experience and actually begins to feel like paint by the numbers movie with some of the major technical and logical aspects of both technology and human nature being conveniently ignore for the sake of coming up with a plot line that's already premade in advance.With the requisite spoiler alert warning in place here, the supposedly reintroduction of an old new nemesis from one of the original Star Trek movies seems rather lame and even that movie while deemed one of the best of the Star Trek movies, neither of them captured the richly substantive social, political, and sometimes deeply relational emotive depth that many of the original television series episodes captured back in the nineteen sixties. This supposedly sci-fi movie continues the trends toward small snippets of supposedly lofty important cerebral experiences that are only included for show and symbolic tokenism, leaving the hard-core sci-fi elements behind that made science fiction so forward and innovative in its raw daring fashion in the nineteen fifties, sixties, and seventies. Instead Star Trek Into Darkness in a way as its name suggests is a continuing move into the darkness of blind conformist, mindless popular action thrillers incorporating science fiction elements replacing quality scriptwriting that had a depth of heart, soul, and the former richness of science fiction that went where no man has gone before.",Star Trek Into Darkness
57,ironhorse_iv,To boldly go to see Star Trek: Into Darkness so I can have kick ass adventure in space!!,8,17 May 2013,"I highly anticipated the movie and was not disappointed by it. First thing first, before seeing this movie. People must watch these few things to make sense of the story is trying to tell. The first one is Star Trek: The Original Series 'Space Seed' Season 1, Episode 22 (1967), an episode that has a similar plot to this movie. The second film to watch before this film is Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan, (1982) set fifteen years after ""Space Seed"" and the last one is Star Trek (2009). All three movies are needed for understanding this film. The movie go like this, a terrorist name John Harrison (Benedict Cumberbatch), a former Starfleet agent just bomb London, and flee to Kronos, the Klingons planet. Now Captain James T. Kirk (Chris Pine) and the crew of the Enterprise is called to bring him back to Earth into justice. Without spoiling too much, the movie was a very good sequel to the 2009's Star Trek. The action, the story, the visual was top notch from beginning to end. The twist in the movie wasn't too big of a twist, to any fanboy or trekkie who research the film beforehand, but for anybody who isn't a die-hard fan, might find the movie a bit confusing. Even if you don't get it, the movie does a good job trying to explain it. The only problem is that the movie felt like déjà vu of pieces of old Star Trek movies scenes stitch into a new movie. It felt like the story cheated in a way, because it use the same tactics just changing the characters into reverse roles. Watch the ending to Wrath of Khan for more detail and then watch this movie ending. The audio and visual were decent. The acting was pretty good. I love Benedict Cumberbatch as the villain. His deep voice, and chilling stare is scary. He really did look unstoppable. I enjoyed the Enterprise crew. Everybody did their bits even if their acting seem a bit too much caricature. Still, it's hard to believe that how young everybody on the crew looks, that this James Kirk would be allow to be Captain for so long. Tired of the man-children. In the real world, someone as young, irresponsible and arrogant would not even be a deck officer in the navy, let alone a captain. Also I believe that Star Trek isn't no longer Sci-Fiction, but more like Fantasy in space, so Sci-Fantasy. I think they finally got the picture, seeing how popular Star Wars was, and Director J.J Abrams decide to make it funnier to watch. Sure, Star Trek tries to rely on science more than Star Wars, but let's face it, there's barely anything plausible on some of the Original Star Trek movies, too. Yes, the science in the Sci-Fiction doesn't make sense, but who cares when the story is that damn good. Enjoy the ride. Yes, at first, I thought the first 2009 Star Trek movie was going to be a joke, but I learn to love it. This isn't your TV Show having taken a turn for the worst, this isn't a disappointing climax to your favorite franchise. This is just another interpretation of the Star Trek Films. No one's forcing you to watch. This is turning out to be a great franchise in my opinion. Overall: There are tons of amazing action sequence throughout the movie blew me away. Enjoy it!",Star Trek Into Darkness
58,The-Sarkologist,Enough different to make it not a remake,6,20 May 2013,"It became clear pretty quickly that this film was basically a remake of the 1982 movie The Wrath of Khan, which is not surprising since both movies are the second movie in the series, though as I had debated with some people this reboot of the Star Trek franchise is not necessarily a reboot because all of the older Star Trek films happened, it is just they were rendered completely obsolete when Kirk's father was killed in the previous movie. Thus it is clear that they are attempting to resurrect the Star Trek franchise (which had pretty much died after three and a half series as well as a number of movies – I'm not entirely sure what they are up to now).I must say though that the previous movie was a lot better that the original movie that was made years ago because the original movie pretty much put me to sleep, and still puts me to sleep, which is generally why I don't watch it (but also because I really don't have all that much time to watch them all again, not with the pile of DVDs that I am gradually making my way through as well as the number of movies at the video store that I want to watch but didn't have time or couldn't be bothered watching at the cinema).The original Wrath of Khan movie pretty much resurrected the Star Trek franchise, and spawned all of the above that I have previously mention. I am not sure whether this film will necessarily do the same, though I get the impression from a number of people that they did really like the film. Hey, I am one of those people, but then again I am not really a big Star Trek fan, and in reality Star Gate and Doctor Who (as well as Star Wars) pretty much wipe the floor with Star Trek. Okay, people can love both, but I am not one of them. Mind you, I have written elsewhere quite extensively as to why I don't like Star Trek, so I won't repeat it here. However, I still decided to go an see this film, and I still liked it, however I doubt I will be running off to see it again anytime soon (not that I have time to watch films multiple times in the cinema, with the exception of The Hobbit of course).",Star Trek Into Darkness

60,tomgillespie2002,Enthralling second entry into the new franchise,7,9 September 2013,"After having to wait a surprising amount of time for the sequel - given the success of its predecessor - Star Trek Into Darkness has a lot to live up to. The 'original' did the remarkable job of bringing a fresh audience to what was thought of (by non-Trekkies) as cheesy sci-fi with bad sets and dodgy haircuts. The franchise had been brought back from the dead, opting for less philosophising and more wallop for your money, which although p*****g a few Trekkies off, kept most viewers at least relatively satisfied. So after finding a way to be able to re-tell the story of the Starship Enterprise without having to re-write 'history', returning director J.J. Abrams found himself with an entire universe to explore. Which makes it very strange that Abrams and his frequent collaborators have chosen not to give us something entirely new, and instead chosen to touch the untouchable - ""KHAAAAAAANNNNNNNN!"".Having made his natural progression from the academy to the captain's chair, Jim Kirk (Chris Pine) and his conflicted friend Spock (Zachary Quinto) begin the film by saving a planet from destruction. Though this is seen as a valiant act in his own eyes, Kirk is reprimanded by Captain Pike (Bruce Greenwood) for knowingly disobeying Starfleet orders. Kirk agrees to a demotion and to become Pike's second-in-command, and they are briefed about a terrorist named John Harrison (Benedict Cumberbatch), who has just blown up a Starfleet installation in London. But after the meeting of the Starfleet commanders is also attacked, Kirk is reinstated by Admiral Marcus (Peter Weller), who gives Kirk the Enterprise back and a mission to take out Harrison.Many of the problems that lay with the first film are back again. Abrams often heaps on too much comedy in a bid to keep the audience entertained, sometimes much to the suffering of some of the film's supporting characters. Much of the supporting crew are reduced to a set- piece here or a funny line there, with Uhura (Zoe Saldana) and Sulu (John Cho) suffering most this time. The story is still focused on the growing relationship between Kirk and Spock, who after many misunderstandings last time around, seem well on their path to the great friendship that will be. Newcomer Carol (Alice Eve) does little more that get her kit off in one pointless and much criticised scene, but, unless you're a die-hard Trekkie, you should be too enthralled to care much about it, as Abrams delivers one breathless set-piece after another, backed by some excellent CGI work.The plot often gets unnecessarily convoluted given the relatively basic plot, and there are plot holes a-plenty if you enjoy picking at them. Yet Cumberbatch's excellent performance as the refreshingly multi- dimensional bad guy is the much-needed 'darkness' from the title, and Abrams really pushes the boundaries of the 12A certificate (if you're from the UK). It's been called the worst Star Trek movie ever made by Trekkies, which seems utterly ridiculous to me. It treads much of the same ground as the beloved Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan (1982), but I believe this was an attempt to bond with the hardcore fans, although I feel The Wrath of Khan is grossly overrated. The re-boot doesn't subvert Star Trek, it simply takes it in another direction, which was the whole point of the exercise. Personally, I'll still be tracking this franchise with wide-eyed curiosity, as Abrams boldly takes us where... well, you get the point.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",Star Trek Into Darkness
61,zkonedog,Great Follow-Up To The Stellar Original,9,7 March 2017,"I loved J.J. Abrams' 2009 reboot of the franchise for the way it expertly brought back the characters Trek fans know and love (even roping in a whole new audience in the process). With ""Into Darkness"", Abrams and his crew again craft an exciting adventure, this time echoing some great Trek lore of the past.For a basic plot summary, this film once again sees Captain James Kirk (Chris Pine), First Officer Spock (Zachary Quinto), Leonard ""Bones"" McCoy (Karl Urban), and the rest of the crew manning the Enterprise. When terrorist James Harrison (Benedict Cumberbatch) detonates an explosive device in England, the Enterprise takes the lead in figuring out just exactly what is going on and proposing the best plan to set things straight again.This is a tough film to review because of potential major spoilers, so the above was about as generic of a plot description as one can give (!). Truth be told, it is a very complex film that hearkens back to many themes running through multiple Original Series adventures.From my point of view, though, the biggest reason that I enjoyed this film so much may be because it builds off the character development of the first to great a great stand-alone Trek story. It even uses the alt-Universe conceit put in place in the first one to weave in some ""old friends"" from the Original Series and its own feature films. Basically, the framework set up in the original is expertly built upon here to create a more stand-alone story with a more interesting villain.The visuals are worthy of Trek science fiction, the dialogue is snappy and contains doses of humor at vital points, the acting is spot-on, and the soundtrack (from Michael Giacchino) is a treat.Thus, ""Into Darkness"" continues this franchise in the right direction.

This time, the plot revolves around the first encounter between Kirk and Khan, one of his most powerful and fearsome enemies. Any similarity between the plot of this film and the plot of ""The Wrath of Khan"" (1982 film) is not mere coincidence but rather homage to the previous work, assuming these films as ""heirs"" of their predecessors. Leonard Nimoy's discreet but forceful presence is also an honorable tribute to one who has become one of the most recognizable faces in the ""Star Trek"" universe.The film retains the main core of the previous cast. Chris Pine, Zachary Quinto, Zoe Saldana, Karl Urban, Simon Pegg, John Cho and Anton Yelchin give life to the central characters, with Benedict Cumberbatch embodying the villain. We cannot talk about mistakes from the cast. They worked well. Even CGI was generally better than in the immediate 2009 movie, though some things remain unrealistic and there are certain plot holes that elementary science knowledge could have avoided.

The second Star Trek movie is as good as the first one, with Kerk and Spoke becoming friends and working together to bring down Kahn. Of course the movie didn't get to the interesting point until it reached the middle of it. So the first one was a mess, with the plot getting confusing at some parts and makes you feel like they simply don't know how to handle it. But the second part is way better, with just enough action, just enough drama and just enough thrill. The ending could have been better though. The performances are okay and the costumes are very original, with bright colors being in contrast with the dark space. Though the title did confused me, as it has no relation to the story.

The cast have great chemistry with each other, especially Spock & Kirk who bring wit to the franchise. Kane was played well by Benedict Cumberbatch and the storyline line was thought through and executed well. The budget was also used well, but the blue flair throughout the movie did get on my nerves. It seems like the director, J.J. Abrams, is sticking to the order of the original franchise, which should work up well if he does a good job. In all, this movie has something for everybody and the Trekkies out there won't be disappointed. Enjoyable!Round-Up: I'm glad that this movie made a profit because it didn't blow up at the box office but no one had a bad word to say about it. I'm also glad that the director was able to get the same cast back that he used on the first movie because this film wouldn't have worked without them. On the downside, it is slightly a bit to close to the first movie, but I hope that the director will change it up a bit for the next outing. I do think that they should have used Kane more, like the original movie, but that's just me being picky.Budget: $190million Worldwide Gross: $234millionI recommend this movie to people who are into the Star Trek franchise and who enjoyed the first movie in this franchise. 7/10",Star Trek Into Darkness
65,Movie_Muse_Reviews,Nothing short of ideal blockbuster filmmaking,9,17 May 2013,"Having inherited the keys to ""Star Wars,"" J.J Abrams has seen a rash of outbursts from skeptics in the last few months, picking up steam with this, the release of his second adventure with the crew of the U.S.S. Enterprise. Surely one man cannot control both nerd worlds, right? Well, ""Star Trek Into Darkness"" offers more proof why everyone should just let him try.Abrams has an acute understanding of creating universally enjoyable entertainment not really seen since Steven Spielberg in his heyday. His use of mystery as a tool to pull viewers in creates the sensation of a two-hour thrill ride, which is essentially what we get with ""Into Darkness."" Equal credit goes –of course—to his team, especially writers Roberto Orci, Alex Kurtzman and Damon Lindelof, who each add yet another shining bullet point to their respective resumes. Much of the formula that made the initial ""Star Trek"" reboot a success gets implemented in this script. The pace of the film never lags, delivering persistent action, suspense, mystery or some combination of the three, stopping only for character-developing moments (and usually ending them with a sudden bang). The ace in the hole—and what makes ""Into Darkness"" a better film by a slim margin—is Benedict Cumberbatch as the villain.If you're familiar at all with Cumberbatch's work, particularly in the title role on BBC's ""Sherlock,"" you knew that at some point he would play a significant villain and absolutely nail it. Fortunately for ""Star Trek"" fans, Abrams got the first chance to unleash Cumberbatch on a mass-scale audience. His role allows him to be the perfect combination of a formidable physical and mental threat, and the script has you clawing for the truth from the onset that it only magnifies Cumberbatch's strengths. Eric Bana's Nero in the previous film pales in comparison.""Into Darkness"" continues much of the focus of the earlier film, adding complexity to James Kirk's (Chris Pine) gutsy and arguably reckless decisionmaking, Spock's (Zachary Quinto) inability to feel emotions and the friendship between the two. After the opening scene mission on the planet Nibiru in which Kirk violates Starfleet directives to save Spock, Kirk loses to the Enterprise back to its former captain Pike (Bruce Greenwood), but his probation doesn't last long when Starfleet's own, John Harrison, (Cumberbatch) blows a Starfleet archive in London and essentially declares war with the federation. Running at the chance to catch Harrison, Kirk plunges the Enterprise and its crew right into the middle of a deadly no-win scenario. There's a lot of who's really the bad guy manipulation/mind games on the script's part that doesn't exactly fit together nicely all the time in terms of what's really going on, but the level of danger and urgency never fades and that makes ""Into Darkness"" an ideal blockbuster. Once again, Abrams and co. aren't afraid to pick up the Enterprise like a hyper toddler and shake and smash it and its crew until there seems to be no hope (except for that perfect window to save the day that was set up by some earlier occurrence in the movie).As Abrams has said multiple times in interviews, he was never a fan of ""Star Trek"" growing up, so he aimed to make these films accessible to a wider audience. ""Into Darkness"" definitely is, with plenty of goodies for fans of varying degrees. A sequence on the Klingon home world of Kronos satisfies the hard sci-fi and ""Trek"" fans' curiosity about the extent of Abrams' take on this universe, while also teasing its potential. You're going to want more Klingons after this film.Right there is what ought to give ""Star Wars"" fans some confidence in Abrams: the curiosity factor, the scratching at the surface of the lore that attracts a geek following and appeasing it, while at the same time still delivering a focused, entertaining film that emphasizes the importance of the characters. The biggest problem with the ""Star Wars"" prequels as compared to the original trilogy is the poor quality of the characters and relationships. Just restoring that element to the mix guarantees a certain measure of success with the new ""Star Wars"" films.""Star Trek"" is in a really good place after ""Into Darkness."" The first two films work together in terms of the character relationships and themes, and while there will always be room to test the bounds of Kirk and Spock's friendship, to use an example, the door has been opened for the Enterprise to explore anything and everything Gene Roddenberry's rich universe has to offer.~Steven CThanks for reading!

66,GOWBTW,To boldly go where no movie goer has gone before!,10,18 May 2013,"For all the Star Trek fans, the sequel to the 2009 hit has come! Kirk (Chris Pine), Spock(Zachary Quinto), Ulhura (Zoe Saldana), and the rest of crew have come back to tackle another threat that has come to mind. The ever maverick Kirk, goes to a foreign planet that is so primitive, he lets his crew get discovered. That violation gets him demoted and sent to Starfleet. But a bombing in London gets him back to the Enterprise after the terrorist kills Admiral Pike (Bruce Greenwood). The terrorist is Commander John Harrison (Benedict Cumberbatch) who is later known as Khan! Khan is a superhuman being who is genetically enhanced to withstand the harsh atmostsphere was released by Admiral Marcus (Peter Weller, ""RoboCop"") who is responsible for the mess. His daughter Dr. Carol Marcus (Alice Eve) who helped out Kirk and the Enterprise crew. The photon torpedo that Dr. Marcus and McCoy find didn't have special ammunition, but are used to hold the cryonically placed beings of Khan's people. And the rogue Admiral was responsible for this. Kirk and Spock have been put through the test, and they have return the favors from each mission. Very logical to say the least. This movie was high impact, high quality, and high action. Got to see what the Klingons look like in this version. And it kind of close to the 1980's version of Part II & Part III. This is a real improvement from the first one. It's a must see, 5 stars!",Star Trek Into Darkness
67,Turfseer,"Despite the derivative plot, Reboot #2, far outshines Reboot #1",6,20 June 2013,"I'm happy to report that 'Star Trek Into Darkness' is superior to the ho-hum 2009 initial Reboot. Here you get two villains for the price of one; they manage to be much more fleshed out than the bald Romulan, Nero, in the 2009 film, an unlikeable sadist of a character, who viewers could never warm up to.At least the two villains in 'Into Darkness', Starfleet's Admiral Marcus, and the genetically engineered superhuman, rogue Starfleet agent, John Harrison (aka 'Khan'), operate on the surface, with some sort of (albeit twisted), moral imperative. Marcus is sort of a futuristic Dick Cheney run amok, determined to provoke a war with the Klingons, who he fears will soon destroy the Federation. And Khan, who resorts to terrorism when he blows up a secret Starfleet installation in London, is actually trying to get back at Marcus, who has stashed 72 of his superhuman comrades inside photon torpedoes, which end up on the Enterprise.After Kirk's mentor, Admiral Pike, is killed by Khan, in a direct attack on Starfleet headquarters in San Francisco, Marcus correctly calculates that the impulsive Kirk, will gladly follow his 'shoot to kill' orders, and take out Khan, who has fled to Chronos, the Klingon home world. Kirk's impulsivity is what makes him interesting. Don't ask me why it's necessary for Marcus to place the 72 'pod people' in the photon torpedoes, because after all, Kirk could eventually disobey his orders and they could be discovered, which could mean bad news for Marcus, back at Starfleet. But that's exactly what happens. So why didn't Marcus dispose of Khan's 72 buddies before he orders Kirk to go after Khan? Some internet posters have suggested that Marcus wants to 'stick it to' Khan after he becomes a turncoat. Khan will die with the knowledge that all members of his race will die with him, at the same moment.If Kirk happens to have a little of 'Marcus' in him in his thirst for revenge, it's up to his 'United Nations' crew members, to become more 'balanced' and bring Kirk back into the fold, so he conforms to acceptable behavior, within the context of international (or shall we say, 'universal') law. 'Scotty' is first to sound the trumpet of 'lawful behavior', when he resigns his commission after he's banned from inspecting the torpedoes. And then Spock, Bones and Uhura, who today would make a great team on a Commission of Human Rights, convince Kirk to take Khan alive.'Into Darkness' really picks up in terms of plot, when a series of reversals keep us guessing as what's going to happen next. Marcus attacks the Enterprise and disables it; Kirk offers to give up Khan and the 72 cryogenically frozen ones but before Marcus can kill everyone, Scotty infiltrates Marcus' unmarked Federation starship, the USS Vengeance, and causes a power outage; after Kirk and Khan do a 'space jump' to the Vengeance, Khan manages to kill Marcus and take over the ship. But Spock manages to beam the torpedoes onto the USS Vengeance, explode them, causing the ship to become incapacitated, just like the Enterprise.There's a spectacular scene as Khan crashes the USS Vengeance into Starfleet Academy in San Francisco as well as his apprehension by Spock and Uhura (please rest assured that in the future, there are still cable cars operating in San Francisco!).'Into Darkness' could have been a masterpiece except for the unfortunate fact that it is wholly derivative. Kids who are not familiar with earlier Trek movies, might not realize that when Kirk saves the ship by going into the radiation chamber and has an emotional farewell with Spock, that's almost a direct rip-off from Star Trek 2: Wrath of Khan. Except in the earlier film, the roles are reversed: it's Spock who gets radiated, dies and saves the ship! I know this is supposed to be a tribute to Wrath of Khan, but tributes should not be direct copies. It's an example of LAZY Screen writing.Examples of additional laziness abound in Reboot #2. Consider how easy it is that Kirk is revived when they discover Khan's blood has restorative properties. One unexplored implication is that many people on earth will now be resurrected from death, by simply tapping into the blood supply of the 72 pod people, once they are brought out of suspended animation.There are plenty of more scenes that are copies from earlier Trek incarnations. Take for example, the opening scene, where the Prime Directive is violated. How many times did we see that before? Another group of indigenous peoples, being saved by the noble crew of the Enterprise. Or how about the 'machine gun' attack on Starfleet Headquarters or when Kirk and Khan, do the 'space jump'? You'll just have to ignore In Darkness' lack of originality, if you want to enjoy this film.The story is also enhanced by how the screenwriters give the supporting players, their moment in the sun. I happen to favor Simon Pegg as the best actor in the film and enjoyed how he disabled the ship, in the proud tradition of the original Scotty, James Doohan. Bones is nicely utilized when he helps out arming the torpedoes and saves Kirk; Uhura helps Spock subdue Khan and Chekov has some nifty moments, below deck. Sulu also manages to get in the act by some death-defying piloting.Spare me all the little petty arguments between Kirk and Spock as well as the aforementioned copycat radiation chamber scene. Nonetheless, Chris Pine and Zachary Quintero, are becoming much more comfortable as worthy precursors of Shatner and Nimoy.Now that J.J. Abrams has improved his reboot, it's high time that he steps up his game and comes up with a truly original screenplay for the third installment. Keep the copycat stuff to a minimum. 'In Darkness' passes the testbarely.",Star Trek Into Darkness
68,thinker1691,""" The enemy to be feared is in the Heart of all you cherish """,8,14 September 2013,"This newest film called "" Star Trek into Darkness "" was written by Alex Kurtzman and Roberto Orci and directed by J.J. Abrams. From the beginning, Captain Kirk and Mr. Spock (Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto) are at odds with each other over Kirk's recent life and death decisions. In additions, Kirk is chastised by his commanding officer Christopher Pike (Bruce Greenwood), now an Admiral. Just as Kirk is about to be relegated to a lessor status, Star Fleet H.Q. comes under attack by Khan (Benedict Cumberbatch) an old Nemesis which throws everything into a complete turmoil. As a result, the starship Enterprise and it's crew are placed on a collision course with the Klingon Empire which might end with all out war. Friendships are tested and so too is the Enterprise with it's special cargo brought aboard despite Scotty's objections which could prove disastrous for all concern. The film is incredibly filled with action scenes and much intrigue. Nearly all the characters are in conflict with each other as the director tries to mold the old with the new. Still the script calls for much action to keep this newest offering exciting right through Warp drive. Cast members like Zoe Saldana, Karl Urban, Simon Pegg, John Cho and Anton Yelchin reprise their earlier roles. All in all this newest addition is an action packed sequel to Roddenberrys' original series and it lives up to his standards in every way. Recommended to all Star Trek fans. ****",Star Trek Into Darkness
69,BeneCumb,Good movie... Although with some underused characters,7,8 September 2013,"I am very picky in watching sci-fi movies, they tend to be too ""inward"" (= slow, few lines) or too technological to me. Star Trek series holds a nice balance between them and, therefore, I have seen all on them; without a wow! feeling, but still having a good time. The movie in question had the latter influence on me, I was eager to know how all the space mess created would end. Well, sometimes there were lots of explosions and flashes, but great (Benedict Cumberbatch, Simon Pegg - Brits outperforming Americans again :)) or good (the rest) actors prevented the movie to become a purely technical course of events. Some actors, however, could spend more time on screen (Zachary Quinto, Anton Yelchin) and the character of Dr. Carol Marcus provided no additional value to the movie. As for the main star Chris Pine, I am not a fan of him, he is not a top-A-whatever grade actor to me. On the other hand, he was not annoying, although I would have expected to see his presence less and others' more on screen :) Star Trek Into Darkness is definitely for you if you like space action with versatile characters. Sci-fi fans following the book should probably avoid it as the script is a mix.",Star Trek Into Darkness
70,DarkVulcan29,Better than the first one,10,22 May 2013,"Kirk(Chris Pine) and crew go after a mysterious terrorist named John Harrison(Benedict Cumberbatch) after he attacks Starfleet. They trail him to a forbidden place. But what gonna be discovered is what gonna surprise you the most.This was better than the first, in terms of effects, action, and effects. Chris Pine and Zachery Quinto give amazing performances, so does Zoe Saldana. But Benedict Cumberbatch steals the show. And it never misses the chance at the humorous scenes, which are pretty funny when they do come. Any sci fi adventure film will have some competition, because this one will be very hard to top.",Star Trek Into Darkness
71,dfranzen70,Yes! Better than the first one,9,18 May 2013,"In this second movie in the reboot of the original movies based on the old TV show, Captain James Tiberius Kirk of the Enterprise must face not only the renegade bad guy but also himself. Yes, I know, it's deep. Star Trek Into Darkness is, however, even better than its immediate predecessor, with spellbinding effects that actually look good in 3D, fleshed-out characterizations, and fine acting all around.It's a year after the events in the first movie, and Kirk (Chris Pine) and company have been sent to a remote planet to observe and report. They discover that an active volcano is about to erupt, which would eradicate the indigenous society. Ignoring the Prime Directive, Kirk has Spock (Zachary Quinto) lowered into the volcano via shuttle and line to place and then detonate a nuclear device that would render the volcano inert. But, as they tend to do in ST films, things go wrong and Kirk has to reveal the hidden Enterprise to the society in order to rescue Spock. That's just the leadup. At Starfleet HQ, Commander Pike (Bruce Greenwood) is livid. You see, Kirk's report terms the trip as ""uneventful""; Spock's, however, details everything. The insubordination, the unwillingness to follow the rules, the hubris, and the lack of humility, all add up to Kirk's being stripped of command and demoted, with Spock to be transferred. However, an emergency meeting of top Starfleet brass is convened to discuss the recent bombing of a Starfleet building that housed archives. The meeting itself is attacked by a former Starfleet agent named John Harrison (Benedict Cumberbatch), who then flees to an uninhabited part of the distant Klingon homeworld of Kronos. The Enterprise, with Kirk at the helm - but minus Scotty - takes off after Harrison, armed with 72 long-range missiles; the idea is to park just outside Klingon space, aim the torpedoes at Harrison, and fire away. But things...well, you know the drill. Things ain't what they seem to be.There are plot revelations in this movie in almost every other scene, and certainly I won't go into them here. They all made sense (save for one, which seemed more like a red herring than anything else). But one point you should know going into this movie: a man without peace may desire war, the best way to gain power.Elements of some of the original films are in play here. I think this rebooting is better than, say, redoing the Batman or Superman sagas every so often, because director J.J. Abrams simply grabs some plot points from various iterations of the series and inserts them at rational points. There is a feeling of real progression, that the crew grows with each mission, especially Kirk himself. Their transformations are sometimes excellent foreshadowing and sometimes elegant and subtle.I also feel that the actors playing the crew members are growing into their roles, growing together as a cohesive unit. We no longer see one person doing one job, incapable of helping; they are a team much more like the The Next Generation gang was, less like The Original Series.The acting ranges from adequate to fantastic. Loved Pine and Quinto, who have several difficult, emotional scenes; loved Zoe Saldana as Lt. Uhura, Anton Yelchin as Ensign Chekov, Karl Urban as Dr. McCoy, John Cho as Lt. Sulu, and especially Simon Pegg as Lt. Cmdr. Scotty. None is a liability; all seem well cast and developed. In fact, we o get to know a little more about Uhura, Spock, and Scotty, and I suspect in future ST films we'll get more backstory as needed.Star Trek Into Darkness does contain quite a bit of dazzling effects, and it might be best seen in 3D. Even in 2D, it would be a spectacle to watch. It's one of those rare films that combines visual wizardry with an actual compelling plot and multidimensional characters.It is possible that real Trek fans will be displeased with the movie. Some may have wanted a replica of Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan. Some may have wanted a completely original story. The writers and director knew very well that they couldn't possibly please all mega fans, so they boldly chose a third path. The movie is, above all, a believable entry that is both faithful and original to the Trek universe.",Star Trek Into Darkness

Abrams-Super 8, Star Trek-2009, Mission Impossible 3. Chris plays Kirk, who doesn't always play by the rules. Zachary is Spock, the unemotional logical thinking Vulcan. Peter is Admiral Marcus, in charge of Starfleet command and Alice is his daughter Carol, the newest member on the Enterprise. Benedict is the villain John Harrison, a former Starfleet cadet that has become a terrorist-You know how those disgruntled employees can get. After Benedict attacks Starfleet Headquarters, he escapes to a hidden Klingon planet, where Chris and crew pursue him and try not to start an interplanetary war with the Klingons. Along the way, there is a cameo of an original Star Trek actor, the birth of an alien species-familiar to fans of the t.v. series and the death of a major character. FYI: there is not a scene after the end credits. If you like the Star Trek universe, you should enjoy this one. It has all the necessary elements, including the humor and even some twists on it's own beloved history. It is being shown in regular 2D, 3D & IMAX 3D-that's the one I saw it in. It's rated ""PG-13"" for the intense action and violence and has a running time of 2 hours & 2 minutes. I really enjoyed it and I would buy it on Blu-Ray.",Star Trek Into Darkness
73,JoeB131,The Re-Wrath of Khan!,8,17 May 2013,"Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan was the best of the movies. Nearly every film since then has tried to recreate the formula with a similar scenery-chewing villain, and this film decides, what the heck, let's just bring back Khan.Does it work? Kind of. I found myself intermittently being touched by the nice nods to the classics of Trek and then rolling my eyes at some of the corniness and over the top action scenes.SPOILERS- After a series of terrorists attacks on Star Fleet, Kirk and company are sent to the Klingon home world to hunt down the perpetrator, whom they are told is a renegade Star Fleet office but is in fact Khan. Seems he was resurrected by a renegade admiral who wanted to use his knowledge to prepare for war with the Klingons.They have some subtle commentary on the war on terror and the ends justifying the means. Mostly, though, it's enough plot to hang an okay action movie on. Peter Weller does a great job in his role. The machinations between Kirk and Admiral Marcus and Khan are pretty good.Good stuff? Carol Marcus, a Tribble, Klingons, a ship they seized from Harry Mudd, Section 31, and so much more from a Trek Nerd's wish list.Also, have to say a lot of good things about the characters here. They all disappear into their roles fairly easily, with maybe the exception of Pine, who simply is not invoking Shatner just yet. Karl Urban is great as McCoy, but he's completely underutilized. Quinto is becoming a convincing Spock.The more dubious stuff. The action scenes are a bit much, to the point of eliminating my suspension of disbelief. This is the kind of cartoonish stuff the Star Wars Prequels did. They spent a lot of money on this, and frankly, STII:TWOK got the same emotional impact with cheap sets on a movie they originally planned as a made for TV operation.The actor who played Khan... just didn't work for me. Ricardo Montalban did it a lot better. The Deus Ex Machina they use at the end to save a major character is telegraphed so obviously there's no tension, and after they spend a lot of time creating a thematic bridge between this and the climax of TWOK.Worth watching. Yes.",Star Trek Into Darkness
74,runamokprods,I seem to be going against the trend here...,8,2 February 2014,"As much as I liked Abrams' 2009 re-boot of the Star Trek series, I liked this second installment better. I think that's because there was less of an obligation to fill up back-story, and more ability to go deeper both into plot, and into the emotions of these new, younger versions of the characters we now (re) know. Add to that Benedict Cumberbatch makes a complex and compelling villain, even if the character does borrow from other sources, including Rutger Hauer in ""Blade Runner"". The humor is funny, the emotional scenes have a real impact, the battles are exciting, the acting is excellent, the plot twists are clever, and the more epic 'big' moments are really effective. There are flaws; some plot twists can be seen coming a mile off, there are a few painful cheats or jumps in logic, and a handful of too-easy coincidences. But for a big summer blockbuster this has more smarts, style, punch and humanity than most.",Star Trek Into Darkness
75,drqshadow-reviews,"A Large-Scale, if Action-Drowned, Space Epic",6,21 August 2013,"A skillful space-faring overdose of adrenaline, if not really my idea of a Star Trek film. Into Darkness has the makings of a curvy, complicated red tape thriller, but its predictability, superficiality and outright refusal to go more than five minutes between jump-cut-loaded action scenes halts the germination of that seed relatively early. With the exception of big-bad Benedict Cumberbatch, who manages to be both admirable and despicable in even doses, the film is thoroughly overacted and the touches of fan service that I so relished in the 2009 reboot seem far more forced and unnecessary the second time around. There's also a notable lack of gravitas to the proceedings, in my opinion one of the hallmarks of the series, with an unfamiliar trigger-happy temperament lending the impression of an adult who's regressed into a period of renewed adolescence. That's not to say it isn't enjoyable: the action sets, though frequent, are constantly fresh and exciting, while its daring in even-handedly tackling the subject of a 23rd century terrorist is progressive and topical. I merely found myself wishing for a bit more meat and a smaller serving of kicks, punches and phasers.",Star Trek Into Darkness
76,XweAponX,Standing Ovation from a room full of Trek Fans.,10,27 May 2013,"I have had it up to my Vulcan Ears with the targeted attacks on this new Trek. When negative reviews seem to pile up and all repeat themselves verbatim, they were not written by several different people but in fact ONE person. Targeted Attacks to try to bring down the Rating of a film. As you can see, the overall Rating does not agree with the pompous spouting of a few loud individuals. Most of the people who have seen this film have enjoyed it as much as I did - Even giving it a standing ovation at the end credits -The WHOLE room, all standing up and cheering at the end. This tells a different story than the story told by the 1-star commenter who uses several identities to say the same thing over and over.Stardate -308983.9I walked into the theater never having seen a film made for I-Max, *in* I-Max - This is the best 3D I have never seen.From the start, we see Kirk doing what Kirk is best at doing: Completely Disregarding the Prime Directive and the Chain of Command. This Enterprise as we see it at the beginning of this latest Voyage, is a ship of Squabbling Crewmembers. Kirk is Squabbling with Spock who is Squabbling with Uhura who is squabbling with Sulu and Scotty is absolutely refusing to Obey Kirks Orders.Bookends. The first thing we see is the Enterprise rising from the Ocean on a Planet of Jungle People who would have all died. SPOCK Would have died. If not for Kirk's Disobedience. For all of Kirk's Insubordination, he is rewarded with a big fat kick in the buttocks by Starfleet Command. Reduced in Rank, The Enterprise Given back to it's Former Commander, it appears for a bit that we are back to the way things were before Kirk joined Starfleet: If not for one Christopher Pike.Meanwhile a Starfleet Officer with a dying daughter is seen being confronted by a strange, eerie man. KHAN. Who heals the Officer's ailing daughter - For A High Price. But it was all a ruse, every event that occurs which brings Kirk back into Command of his ship has been designed by this one man. This new KHAN who has been given depth and dimension never afforded the same character we met in ""Space Seed"". In fact, some of the things which occurred in the Prime Universe appear to never have happened at all in this Alternate Universe. This does not need to be explained, this needs to be enjoyed. And we, as a theater, as a whole, enjoyed it.So the Enterprise goes to Qo'nos, armed with some ""new torpedoes""- To Qo'nos, because Khan has used Scotty's Transwarp Transporter to escape there. So for the first time in this Universe, we get to see Klingons and their ships.But we have been tricked, as Kirk has been tricked. We've been looking at the wrong Bad Guy. But have we? It requires a Phone Call to Spock Prime on New Vulcan to get some needed facts about this Khan.The squabbling at the beginning of the film between the primary characters is due to the fact that Spock indeed has emotions, just as he always has had emotions, he is just being Logical in not wanting them to govern his actions. But even this is tested down to the bone in this characterization of Spock.This is an Enterprise Crew which is handed events that would have ripped the Original Series Crew into thousands of bits. It just seems that in these new stories, there is NO TIME- Because something else is always happening or being set up to happen.So we in the theater embraced this rapid-fire Trek which shot off several episodes worth of raw story in Phaser-Rifle succession. I've seen one particular type of complaint saying ""This is a remake of The Wrath of Khan"" or ""Canon was ruined and ignored"" - And this one person who is posting these complaints as many other people is missing the point that this is not the Original Universe, and is not giving his or herself permission to just ENJOY the premise that this *is* an alternate Reality.This is just to say, there is a TIME to keep things the same and a time to move on to new things. For the new Production Team, the same Team that bought us Fringe - To take on this new endeavor is difficult, because it would be easy to get stuck in the same rut that caused Enterprise to close it's ShuttleBay Doors prematurely.And because of that, Gene Roddenberry's hand-picked successor was given the boot by Paramount and the four or five huge storehouses of Trek Props which had been saved since The Original Series were sold to the highest bidders.So A Worthy Successor had to be chosen, and I believe the right guy was given the Job. To me, this is the same as the Klingon Right of Succession for the leader of the High Council.So it is not that Trek references were crammed into a 2-hour film, it was the proper use of them. Spock contacts Spock Prime, and Spock Prime is STILL Spock from The Original Series. This is ESTABLISHED.If you think that Trek has been ruined - Then stick your DVD of ""Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan"" into your DVD player and you can watch that repeatedly for the rest of your life - While the rest of us move on and explore the galaxy with this new Crew. Because Bajor is out there, Cardassia is out there, The Founders are still out there (And Odo). The Prophets are still there, now we can meet them all again in a whole new way - And I can't wait for the next installment of this great franchise.",Star Trek Into Darkness
77,alindsay-al,How to do a sequel right and an absolutely fantastic film,9,12 September 2014,"I think the first JJ Abrams is one of the biggest surprises I have seen in a while for how good it is and this film is just as good as that film. Kirk, Spock and the rest of the crew attempt to capture an ancient warrior threatening them called Khan. Just like the first film this film is co-led by Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto and they both do superb jobs with Kirk being a captain who is relatable and charismatic to lead the crew. Spock is not relatable but a cool character who parallels Kirk really well which creates a good dynamic between the two. The side characters are all great too and this film is stolen by one man and one man only Benedict Cumberbatch as Khan. He is absolutely superb from his look to his voice and dialogue to his action scenes making him the coolest character in Star Trek and I really hope we see him again in the future. Zoe Saldana, Karl Urban and Simon Pegg are also great in their roles returning from the first film as good as then. The story is okay but it can be a bit confusing but there is also some great instances of story telling as well. The script and dialogue between everyone is great with Cumberbatch nailing all of his lines but also everybody else having great lines. Before seeing the film you would know that the style of the film would be great and it is as expected. This is a fantastic film and with Abrams moving to Star Wars it excites me that and also with these two fantastic films I am looking forward to Star Trek 3.",Star Trek Into Darkness
78,MBunge,"So, is this reboot ever going to have a purpose other than making money?",5,18 May 2013,"I thought JJ Abrams' initial reboot of the franchise was fresh, exciting and not really much of a Star Trek movie. Into Darkness is still moderately exciting and slightly more Trekish, though more of the DS9 and Voyager variety than either Classic or Next Gen, but the freshness of Abrams' take expires long before this film is over. The story swaps out stunning scientific illiteracy for a senselessly elaborate plot that feels more like an overstuffed episode of Alias. The interior of the new Enterprise continues to make less sense than the TARDIS. And while the rest of the cast comes a bit closer to matching Karl Urban's great imitation of DeForest Kelley, the fact remains that the only reason any cares about Kirk is William Shatner, the only reason anyone cares about Spock is Leonard Nimoy and the only reason anyone cares about this motion picture is Gene Roddenberry.Into Darkness stays true to the fanfic alt-history approach of Abrams and mashes up the first re-appearances of both Khan and the Klingons with a ""lessons of 9/11"" message that would have been bold 10 years ago but is now positively moldy, especially given that it follows the similarly ""lessons of 9/11"" themed Iron Man 3. There's a whole lot of running around, some decent action and comedy bits and Alice Eve joins the cast, which is good enough to raise anything at least one star on the ratings scale.Remember when fans of the John Carter movie got all defensive over how badly it bombed at the box office? I remember because I was one of those fans and Star Trek: Into Darkness is a great example of why we tried to make so many excuses. This film isn't substantially better than John Carter. It inarguably isn't so much better that is deserves to make a couple hundred million dollars more in ticket sales. The power of the Trek brand, however, will get people into the theater and Abrams provides an adequate diversion for a couple of hours. If Disney hadn't almost entirely abandoned John Carter to the whims of fate, a sequel to that might have been just as unavoidable as this one.There are a host of ""Wait...what?"" moments in this movie. Let me focus on just two of them. Wrath of Khan brilliantly handled the problem of how to credibly defeat an enemy who is smarter than you through the insight that intelligence is not the same as knowledge or wisdom. Classic Kirk and Spock whupped Khan's butt by taking advantage of his inexperience and emotional immaturity. Muppet Babies Spock is victorious because Muppet Babies Khan is an idiot who falls for a pretty obvious trick. And during Into Darkness' most notorious echoing of Star Trek II, can anyone explain what lesson is being learned and who is learning it? I don't think we need to get into the films' respective ""KHAAAAAAN"" screams and how Wrath's made perfect dramatic sense while Abrams' version is melodramatic tripe.I am surely being too critical of this thing. Judged on the awesomely low standards of summer blockbusters, it's definitely above average. I'd just like to know when this rebooted franchise is going to offer something more than Roddenberry's reheated leftovers.",Star Trek Into Darkness

For I have returned to have my vengeance.¨First off I have to say that I loved J.J. Abrams' reboot of the Star Trek franchise in 2009 and I was highly anticipating this sequel. I had my reservations of whether or not Abrams was going to be able to maintain the same level of success he achieved with the prequel since the originality and freshness of the characters was going to be gone. It is much easier to reboot a known franchise and make it fresh with the introduction of new characters and letting us know how everything began (sort of like what Batman Begins did), but it is much more difficult to make a worthy sequel to such a beloved prequel. Somehow I think Abrams managed to pull it off once again by introducing a great villain and maintaining the freshness of the original film with some great chemistry between Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto along with the rest of the crew. At many points during the movie it even felt like a buddy comedy instead of a blockbuster sci-fi action film, but then Abrams managed to mix it all together quite nicely. It may be much lighter than The Dark Knight, but I felt he did something similar to what Christopher Nolan did with his trilogy by giving us a great villain and giving the movie several layers. This sequel may even be better than the prequel although many people may disagree with me. At least I think Abrams was able to maintain the same level of entertainment once again. This is a very fun and engaging movie with some great characters and spectacular visuals. This is the best film I've seen this year and by far the most entertaining one. I was never a big fan of the Star Trek TV series or the original movies, but I was completely hooked with the reboot and Abrams once again teams up with screenwriters: Damon Lindelof, Alex Kurtzman, and Roberto Orci to give us a gripping script with some great twists that Trekkies will probably enjoy. I don't want to give away any spoilers, but if you've seen the film you know what I'm talking about. Star Trek into Darkness is the most fun I've had in theaters this year.The movie takes place one year after the events of the prequel as we follow the crew from the USS Enterprise and their Captain, Kirk (Chris Pine), as they encounter new missions into foreign galaxies. In their latest mission they are trying to save a civilization from a volcano eruption without them knowing of their presence. Kirk and his First Commander, Spock (Zachary Quinto), manage to save the planet, but Kirk does so by breaking some rules. This doesn't go well with Spock who despite being saved doesn't agree with breaking protocol. When they arrive back to Earth, Spock informs their bosses and Kirk is discharged from the fleet. While this is taking place a former member of Starfleet, John Harrison (Benedict Cumberbatch), bombs an installation in London and later attacks a high ranking officers meeting at the Starfleet headquarters before managing to escape. Pike (Bruce Greenwood) is killed during this incident and Admiral Marcus (Peter Weller) reinstates Kirk as Captain of the Enterprise in order for him to hunt down the terrorist. And so the new mission begins with Kirk and Spock back together again with the rest of their crew: Uhura (Zoe Saldana), Bones (Karl Urban), Scotty (Simon Pegg), Sulu (John Cho), and Chekov (Anton Yelchin), all looking for revenge.The relationship between Quinto and Pine's character was probably the highlight in the prequel, and here once again we get to see how their relation has developed over time. The scenes they share together are really entertaining, but the supporting cast is exceptional once again with Simon Pegg and Karl Urban giving the funniest performances and lightening up the mood. Cumberbatch makes for one of the best villains I 've seen this year and his performance is incredible. The twist with his character is really clever and it made me want to go back and watch the original films. The film is so good because it focuses on the characters and their relationships more than on the action and visuals, which are incredible nonetheless. I really look forward to what JJ Abrams and his crew are going to bring to the table in the Star Wars franchise because what they have done here was spectacular by combing comedy and sci-fi action. I am a huge fan of pretty much everything Abrams has done, ranging from what he did with the Lost series to his latest film prior to this one: Super 8. It will be very hard for another summer blockbuster movie to top this one this year. It has really raised the standard and the bar for the upcoming movies. Please go watch this film, you won't regret it.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/",Star Trek Into Darkness
80,iquine,Just Me or is This Rather Brainless?,6,27 August 2019,"(Flash Review)This was a bit of a letdown after the previous one with a weaker and thinner plot that hurt emotional engagement. I am far from a Star Trek guru but this felt more like a super hero story line. The Star Trek crew must stop evil powerful guy with an additional hurdle or two thrown at them. Complete with big CGI action and effects more to dazzle the eye than truly impact the story. Some head scratching moments didn't help such as from the start when the Enterprise emerges after being submerged under water for a significant amount of time and just flies off. That didn't ring true, even in their fictional world that a hyper-sonic spacecraft could do that. I hope the next one had a meatier plot and more memorable.",Star Trek Into Darkness
81,Fluke_Skywalker,This is not your Father's Star Trek,8,17 May 2013,"If 2009's Star Trek straddled the line between reverence and reinvention, then its sequel steps confidently past that line and comes into its own. Those of you who were weened on the original Star Trek TV series and/or its subsequent films will likely find this shift a bit jarring.Featuring a stronger story and more assured performances than its predecessor, Into Darkness is bold, white-knuckle popcorn entertainment at its finest. And while it may lack the depth and thoughtfulness of Rodenberry's original vision, it never the less manages to channel the essence of that spirit into a package that will be appealing and relevant to modern audiences.",Star Trek Into Darkness
82,mattkratz,good entry,9,17 December 2015,"This was a good entry into the ""prequel"" sets of the Star Trek series. Kirk has been assembling the old crew and finds himself doing battles with old enemies, and one in particular. I love the way they set up the character of Khan and the scenes with the Klingons. The allusions to Star Trek II and the scenes with Leonard Nimoy are also well done. I think the cast is excellent and works well together-I especially like Alice Eve as Carol and that allusion to the other movie. This movie works on all levels with action, humor, drama, and combines them perfectly.*** out of ****",Star Trek Into Darkness
83,pixrox1,Star Trek junior still in search of . . .,7,3 July 2013,". . . intelligent life, as the premise behind the carnage done by a HUMAN bad guy--Benedict Cumberbatch as John Harrison, a.k.a. Khan--is thin and unoriginal. Meanwhile, half the crew of the Starship Whatever look like they're ready to audition for HIGH SCHOOL MUSICAL 4. Chris Pine as a young Captain Kirk clearly is the pick of the litter, but in this company that might not be saying much. Experienced movie actor Simon Pegg is adequate in holding down the part of Scottie, but why they heck did the folks planning the story arc for the STAR TREK movie franchise ""reset"" NOT exercise more imagination, and delay some of the key characters from joining the crew for a few installments, taking the opportunity to establish OTHER key characters NOT in previous Trek incarnations (who would, of course, be more easily expendable than Spock, Scottie, Bones, Uhuru, etc.)? Furthermore, just as in G.I. JOE: RETALIATION, INTO DARKNESS begins with the platoon crying in their beers about the deaths of some extras playing colleagues in sister (Star Fleet, here) units, while totally glossing over continents of dead people left by later assaults on humanity in general. This callous disregard for reality (who's to bury all these dead folks??) seriously flaws many of this summer's so-called blockbusters, from OLYMPUS HAS FALLEN and WHITE HOUSE DOWN to IRON MAN 3 and WORLD WAR Z. So it goes.",Star Trek Into Darkness
84,juneebuggy,"Visually stunning, action packed reboot",9,17 June 2015,"Into Darkness was a fantastic movie experience it's visually spectacular and action packed although in all honesty I didn't enjoy it quite as much as the first but its still pretty awesome. Its the kind of movie that Trekkies will love but can also be enjoyed by those just looking for a great action adventure movie.Without getting spoilery I can't talk about my favourite parts but as a Star Trek fan I'll just say that my mind was blown several times. Sure I also had a few niggles (which I won't get into) but all the characters have grown into their roles here and at times I almost forgot that this was a reboot; the comradery between Kirk and Spock feels so familiar, Bones' metaphors, Spock's odds/bedside manner are all brilliantly done. I'm just loving this alternate universe that J.J Abrams has created and can't wait so see where this ""5 year mission"" takes us next.Shout out to Benedict Cumberbatch who steals every scene that he's in, what a great bad guy even if he did feel a bit super-heroish at times, running around kicking ass in his long black hooded coat. Zachery Quinto was also pretty amazing. Special effects have finally caught up to how Star Trek was meant to be seen. 05.13",Star Trek Into Darkness

87,Cristi_Ciopron,The Photonic Torpedoes,10,30 July 2013,"Who is this Abrams? (I had remarked his name on Lost's credits—but regardless. I mean, did you expect something as good as this, from him? Did he make the previous one, too?) Having just seen this newest Star Trek installment, I am still excited by the viewing—a hugely enjoyable movie, and of the best Sci Fi movies ever made—one can make a case for Abrams being an amazing director of genre cinema, established as such by this new Star Trek.I don't know the previous movie, and whether Abrams made that one, too (perhaps that one was the reboot), but this installment is a pinnacle of craftsmanship, eventful, colorful, exciting, galvanizing, the story is good, a Khan movie, and you can see Khan almost taking over, the cast is likable, Spock, Scott, McCoy, Uhura, Sulu, Marcus' daughter, a comic books movie, it reminded a bit of the stylish Alien installment, and Abrams brings a certain finesse, one could say: 'Indiana Jones on Kronos', but I like Abrams better than Spielberg and Lucas, and his take isn't patronizing and mock—referential, he is more assured, more focused on adventure, as opposed to flattering the presumed spleen of the masses; a comic books roller—coaster, Abrams' exquisite taste, an enthralling adventure movie, from a generation who has forgotten, it seems, about the '70s and '80s sense of humor, and the '90s torpor, and it happened with 'Bond', with some superheroes, a shift in the genre cinema, a shift from mindless, say, to finesse—the fistfights are good, all involving Khan: on Kronos, on Marcus's shipboard, and above the city.(Having read a bit about Abrams, I have found out that he directed the previous movie, too.) There is a goofiness in Spielberg or Lucas' genre cinema, something that often comes across as goofy, they like making the action look goofy, or faked—which is patronizing to us, condescending. And when the two play it goofy (to be fair, Lucas less than Spielberg), Abrams plays it straight, as he should; the comparison with I. Allen, the MoD, is useful. Spielberg and Lucas' genuine inferiority to Abrams comes from their goofiness, from what comes across as goofy in their movies, the ironic consciousness, etc..Abrams has sharpness and finesse; also, the score is engrossing, and the sets look great.In Abrams' reboot, Khan makes a great villain, and the fact is that the script and the direction boost him, boost his performance, with his 72 torpedoes; also, I liked Spock, because he's a genuinely likable and interesting actor. So, the thing could be done. At last, a movie without the TV cast! I know the cast of the original series only from the movies, but I found them mainly annoying, Jimbo including; in Abrams' rendering, Chekhov is the only one from the crew to border somewhat on annoying—but even him doesn't quite! The aboriginals who chase the humans in the opening scene seem to have a writing, maybe a papyrus, left hanging from a branch by the hurrying tandem of selfless astronauts dressed like monks, which is a bit unconvincing (but the Maya undertones are delightful, they are in fact very generic aboriginals, with not only American, but African and perhaps Australian, Pacific marks); and why does Khan pick a frock, that only slows his run, when he is chased by Spock? I have read the comment of a discontent, who makes pointless, and by now predictable, objections about the movie's script, style, etc., the now standard chicanery of the discontents—nonsense, rubbish.",Star Trek Into Darkness
88,kluseba,A convincing revamp with outstanding actors,7,18 May 2013,"To set things straight, I'm definitely not a die hard Star Trek fan and I didn't enjoy some of the later movies made in the early nineties as some of these movies were overlong and soulless. I was though rather positively surprised by the reboot and beginning of the new trilogy that came out in 2009. This sequel which is overall already the twelfth Star Trek movie is just as good as its direct predecessor or even slightly better.Let's start with a couple of negative things first. The special and visual effects were decent but not as good as those in other current science-fiction flicks like ""John Carter"" or ""Oblivion"". The soundtrack was decent as well but not outstanding. The story was intriguing enough from the beginning to end and kept my attention high. It will surely please to old and new fans of the series but in my opinion the story was too predictable at some points for many experts of the series. You simply know that the good ones will survive and that the evil guy is truly evil and that's why some parts of the movie lack of suspense.What I really liked about the movie was something else: the acting! I really appreciate the original cast and many nostalgic and closed-minded fans might claim that no actors can equal the originals. In my opinion, this is not true. Chris Pine's version of Kirk is much more diversified, down-to-earth and human than what I recall from the originals. Zachary Quinto's way to take the role of Spock is simply incredible and his acting is simply outstanding throughout the entire movie. Add to this a brilliant over-the-top incarnation of Scotty by Simon Pegg and an obscure and unpredictable main villain like Khan who is very well portrayed by Benedict Cumberbutch. Even the secondary roles were very well cast and I couldn't find any faceless actor or actress in this movie. They all did a very good job which hasn't always been the case in the past of the series.Thanks to this amazing acting and the gripping and very typical story line that makes you rediscover many characters of the original movies, any fan of the series and anyone who is ready to give the fresh revamp trilogy a chance should go to the cinemas and enjoy this movie. It's not groundbreaking and remains somewhat nostalgic of course and I'm normally not a big fan of endless sequels and remakes but this new episode in the Star Trek universe is quite entertaining and addicting. I wouldn't buy the DVD but I will surely watch the third part in the cinemas when the time is right.",Star Trek Into Darkness
89,3xHCCH,"Excellent Action, Excellent Sci-Fi, Excellent Human Drama!",10,16 May 2013,"I am very happy to report that ""Star Trek Into Darkness"" more than lives up to the previous movie, the franchise reboot ""Star Trek"" (2009). In this their second film, the new cast portraying the crew of the Starship Enterprise all really got well and cozy into the skins of their iconic characters. Director JJ Abrams has come up with a movie that will satisfy both old and new fans of this revered franchise. The action and sci-fi sequences are excellent with awesome CGI whatever the setting of the scene, be it in outer space or on land in any planet. The initial sequence alone set in the background of an impending volcanic eruption on a planet with red trees was already breathtaking. And this high level of visual and visceral excellence and excitement would be repeated and maintained throughout the film. The human dimension of the story is also truly executed with excellence. The key scenes between Kirk and Spock were essayed so well by Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto. I enjoyed the interaction and the cooperation among the crew, each with their own talents. Simon Pegg (as Scotty) and Karl Urban (as Dr. Bones) particularly stand out. The antagonist is a super- soldier first known as Harrison, who turns out to be another big character in the Star Trek canon (a name who is in the title of what was arguably the best of the original Star Trek movies). Upcoming actor Benjamin Cumberbatch portrays this super-villain with amazing screen presence. This is a very entertaining, very satisfying movie I heartily recommend to everyone, Star Trek nerd or not. It covers all aspects of the Star Trek that makes it a lasting popular favorite: the team, the adventure, the action, the drama, and yes, the humor, all are still definitely there. The reverence to classic ""Star Trek"" is intact, with cameo appearances by Klingons, Leonard Nimoy and even a Tribble. Yet, there is no stuffy feeling anywhere here, everything is fresh and jumping.I was very surprised that this film did not receive the huge hype that ""Iron Man 3"" did. This excellent film deserves and should make more than just good box office. Anyway, I am glad that it would be steady positive word of mouth that would bring this film its immense success, and not overblown undeserved hype. Highly highly recommended, 10/10!",Star Trek Into Darkness
90,aharmas,Just like playing chess!!,10,19 May 2013,"I had the pleasure of seeing this film a couple of times in the last two days. The first time I was dazzled by its action and adventure, along with the wit we expect from this series. All of the crew is back, from Bones with its biting remarks to Kirk's bravado, but the biggest thrill is seeing how well Quinto embodies Spock, and most impressive is the fact that these people are not afraid to show their feelings.Once again, to the detriment of the purists, the directors/producers/writers go back to the original source and put a twist on it, this time with a little darker tone than the last movie, but the fun is there, and they have excelled in their reenactment of the Khan persona. The actor just steals the show every time he is on the screen, and the rest of the crew just have to try harder to match him, and it does happen a few times.Kirk and the crew find themselves in a middle of a challenging mission, as they have to deal with the personal agenda of their leader, a man who might be looking for more than new civilizations, one of a group of super soldiers with more intelligence than Marcus can imagine, and our Enterprise crew must find a way to stop him and save the Federation from impending doom.The film introduces the new Klingons, continue to raise the bar in their execution of the sound and visual effects, particularly, their pristine 3D. The audience should prepare themselves for a fast ride in the middle of a science fiction universe that has always delighted us with their imagination and humor.Be ready to accept the challenge of imagination and enjoy a thrill time at the movies. This is one is fantastic from beginning to end.",Star Trek Into Darkness
91,adamjohns-42575,Khaaaannnnnn!!!,8,5 October 2021,"Benedict was so wrong as Khannnn!!! I'm so bored of him. He's too Shakespearean, especially in this film. Yes I'm a fan of the originals and yes Ricardo Montalban will always be who I think of when I here the word Khan, so maybe it is hard for me to be objective about it, but for the most part JJ has made things in keeping with the originals and paid homage to them, which is why this casting annoyed me so much.I still like all the other references to the ""Shatnerverse"" that he does put in that most might miss, in particular the new generation of viewers, who don't even know who William Shatner is and they may find this film perfectly fine on its own and Humptycrutch acceptable in this role, but for me, it just taints the whole film a bit as the character seems to have been re-written. When I first watched it I had no idea that it was Khan until he said his name, because he's so far from Ricardo's interpretation.But the film isn't just about him. I like the continued exploration of Kirk and Spock in their early years and the better use of Uhura in a stronger role than her phone answering secretarial counterpart.I'm still gutted about Anton Yelchin's passing. As Chekhov in these films he is such a sweet character and I would have loved to have seen where he went if the films and he had continued.Karl Urban is so good in his role too, that you don't even really notice him. A perfect McCoy.I also have to give credit to Peter Weller, because although he was absolutely terrible in the equally terrible 'Robocop' (1987) film, he fits in here very well.I do wonder if the story as a whole wouldn't have been more suitable as an episode rather than a blockbuster film, but I did still enjoy it, because Roddenberry's universe is such a great place and Abrams generally does it great justice.778.85/1000.",Star Trek Into Darkness
92,Spondonman,Into Direness,7,19 October 2013,"Well, at least this is better than Star Trash from 2009 imho, right from the off it's noisy, eye-catching, even absorbing, and can make you forget about your own mortality for a couple of hours. All good thingshowever! No matter how colourful or action-packed the cartoon is overall it's as vapid and vacuous as the space between us and the Klingon Empire.I didn't really enjoy Wrath Of Khan or any of the other movies either, I'm a confirmed old TOS-er now; why retread old ground adding nothing new but new film technology. Why can't they invent new myths for the younger generations? Baddie Benedict Cumberbatch plays a rather snooty Khan to goodie Chris Pine's rather snotty Kirk – one looking like an old work colleague of mine who had an evil eye the other like an old English soccer millionaire who had glass legs. How humdrum all the characters are though – the baddies aren't enough to frighten us now, cgi special effects have taken their place. And there is some jaw-dropping cartoonery in here, from the first appearance of the Enterprise to the other starship crashing on the city – where will all this ""realism"" end? Pity about the unoriginal story though! Billions and billions of innocent bystanders slaughtered again to the sound of popcorn and ringpulls. It's amazing the bad guy didn't smash into the twin torpedoes of Kirk and Khan as he was being sucked out of the same airlock at the same time – the smash might've created a new particle. All the physical objects, the moving parts, even all the running about people did - another positive for the original Star Trek was that they took teleportation for granted!Flat, dull, stale and unprofitable (to experience). But still, it's a better way to pass two hours than in cryogenic storage, possibly.",Star Trek Into Darkness
93,davidmvining,Poorly told,3,22 November 2019,"I was willing to chalk up a lot of the faults in 2009's Star Trek to the writer's strike that prevented rewrites, but the even larger issues with the follow up are a glaring signal that none of those issues with the previous film would have been fixed without the strike.I haven't seen the movie since it came out in theaters, but I distinctly remember liking it, enjoying it, and defending it to a certain degree over the last few years. However, as the movie started for this rewatch, I began to get a sinking feeling. The opening scene is dizzying and thinly entertaining, but it jumps between breezy fun and super serious really quickly. The super serious stuff feels unsupported and a bit flat. The movie continues on and the further into the movie we get the less important that opening becomes. The planet gets mentioned once more. The moral issue about applying the Prime Directive is gone by the thirty-minute point. The central conflict between Kirk's skirting of the rules and Spock's blind adherence to them is beyond muddled by the halfway point.And the tone never lightens up. One of the great appeals of J.J. Abrams' first Star Trek is its light and breezy tone that jumps from one impossible situation to the other. It makes taking some of its ridiculousness easier because the film wasn't asking us to take it that seriously but as popcorn entertainment. Into Darkness, though, is asking us to take things seriously. Very seriously. It just can't decide what it wants us to take seriously.The Prime Directive? The question of how closely to rules must we operate in order to be a good person? Drone strikes? Executions without due process? The militarization of Starfleet? Ship manifest integrity? Kidnapping frozen men and forcing them to build weapons for you? False flag operations in order to start a war? Literally every idea is there and treated equally, which means that we never get a sense of what this movie wants to say when it so obviously wants to say something.There's a great lesson in this film about showing not telling, the old writing rule of thumb about involving an audience in the actions of the film. Early, Kirk goes to Admiral Marcus after the terrorist we all know is Khan but no one else does has killed a bunch in Starfleet command, and Marcus tells Kirk that a war with the Klingons is inevitable. It's almost a throwaway line, but as the movie enters its third act an hour later, we realize that its central to Marcus' actions. The problem is, in this universe of films, we haven't seen the Klingons yet. They were mentioned a few times in the first movie and this scene in Marcus' office is the first time we've heard of it. If this is a man's motivation to undermine everything he believes in by militarizing an exploratory organization, are we the audience supposed to believe it or not?That display in Marcus' office is largely the level of thought put into every major moral question the movie throws at its characters. It feels like something a fifteen year old would write late into the night and hopped up on Red Bull. ""And then this, and then this, oh! And then this!"" It reminds me a bit of the movie Van Helsing, but that creature feature never thought it was anything other than dumb fun and sort of works because of it. Into Darkness seems to think that it is a very serious movie indeed, and because it can't figure out what to say, the movie ends up feeling really flat.And that flatness really drags the movie down. It could have been fun. I still really liked the cast. Alice Eve is a winning addition as Carol Marcus. Benedict Cumberbatch is very good at chewing the scenery in a big emotional way as Khan. The original cast is largely good, though Chris Pine seems to have some trouble with the more serious things he needs to do. Overall, it's a good cast.The movie also looks great. I genuinely enjoy a few of the action sequences, especially the bit where Kirk and Khan fly from the Enterprise to Marcus' ship through the debris field.I want to end with a quick note about marketing. I'm always surprised at the number of people who hold a movie's marketing against a movie. The King Arthur movie from the mid 00's was billed as the ""real story"", but it's really just a late-Roman telling of Arthur. Maybe it's closer to the idea of who Arthur actually was, but it's still just as fictional as Camelot. The movie itself never mentions the idea, and yet people hold that against the film. Maybe it's an excuse because they have trouble explaining why they don't like movies for specific reasons, but I still find it odd.In this case, Into Darkness's marketing hid the fact that Benedict Cumberbatch was playing Khan. For the first half of the movie he's called John Harrison, and the marketing never broke from that fiction in the first half. Still, hiding Khan's identity from the characters made a certain amount of sense in the film. Khan Noonian Singh was a famous figure from the late 20th century in this universe. Having him interact with people using his own name would have raised flags. It's a fig leaf towards an explanation, though. They really could have just called him Khan and saved us the unintentionally amusing scene where he reveals his true identity to Kirk who then just keeps talking like Khan has said nothing particularly interesting, even though there's a pregnant dramatic pause after the line. I don't think it was a great decision to keep Khan's identity secret (I think the character is actually decently used overall in the film), but it probably should have just been avoided.",Star Trek Into Darkness

95,jadepietro,Boldly Going Forth,9,18 May 2013,"This film is highly recommended.Space...the final frontier. That's our destination and those nasty Klingons are at it again in J.J. Abrams' second installment of the Star Trek series. The Enterprise, with its easily recognized and beloved crew that includes the trustworthy Scotty (Simon Pegg), the seductive but smart Uhura (Zoe Saldana), and the flinty Dr. McCoy (Karl Urban), go to battle to keep the interplanetary peace in Star Trek: Into Darkness. Also on board are Sulu (John Cho) and Chekov (Anton Yelchin) with his forced Russian accent, and of course, their stoic and reckless captain, Jim Kirk (the handsome blue-eyed Chris Pine), and his half-man, half-Vulcan friend, Spock (the immeasurably entertaining Zachary Quinto). Added to the mix is Dr. Carol Marcus (Alice Eve), a perky blonde Starfleet crew member who just may become Kirk's love interest. All are center stage to chart the course to boldly go where no man has gone before.￼Written by Alex Kurtzman, Roberto Orci, and Damon Lindelof, Star Trek: Into Darkness follows the series' idealistic philosophy of racial tolerance and peaceful coexistence while adding more than enough big battles and galactic warfare to show off the film's excellent CGI big budget effects by Industrial Light and Magic. The well-crafted action sequences do go on a bit too long in parts, but one does need to catch their breathe between action set pieces. ￼Without revealing too much of the plot, the Enterprise crew is out to capture a terrorist bomber named John Harrison this time around. Abrams rejuvenates the popular series by resurrecting the next generation of younger actors to fill in for those classic roles and flattery is the highest form of imitation in this case. All of the actors take their coveted roles seriously, with special kudos for this mission going to Pine, Quinto, and Pegg. ￼The screenwriters wisely incorporate numerous battle scenes while still emphasizing the human drama aboard the Enterprise. The simplistic storyline is merely an outline to the barrage of CGI that enliven the film and set up the background for the characters' intimate relationships. Making this particular film so successful is again that tried-and true, if somewhat predictable, winning formula that continues to work for both the television series and the film franchise: the uneasy alliance between Spock and Kirk. Their on-going disagreements and bromance are the most engaging parts of the film as they bond together to fight against those evil forces intent with world annihilation. Evil in Star Trek: Into Darkness is chillingly represented by its villain, played the talented Benedict Cumberbatch. The actor brings with him an intensity and intelligence to his performance, which helps to elevate the level of intrigue and danger.￼Abrams choreographs the action well and has crafted a visually stunning film. The director vividly stages the action sequences with colorful imagery, various aerial shots, and wonderful perspectives to intensify the dramatic elements at play. Production values are all top notch. Stunning photography by Daniel Mindel, detailed set design by Scott Chambliss, and strong film editing from Maryann Brandon and Mary Jo Markey contribute to much of the film's success. The prosthetics and make-up heighten the film's overall impact as does the aforementioned special effects. Michael Giacchino pays fine homage to the theme music and other flourishes he uses to enhance the action on screen. Star Trek: Into Darkness takes its audience for a terrific fantasy ride. Sci-fi fans won't be disappointed and neither will the average moviegoer. With this second addition to their series, Abrams and his able crew continue to make this franchise live long and prosper.

96,Sherazade,Good but could have been better...,7,10 January 2014,"The budget for this film was 190 million???? Seriously??? Why??? I mean I know in order to make a good sci-fi flick (especially with one that already has a strong fan-following and back story which begun decades ago and also revolutionized technology for story lines as such back then) you have to go all out but seriously was spending nearly 200 million necessary? Never mind the fact that this installment of the 'Star Trek' series went so overboard with its grandiose main plots and sub-plots that ten more films and perhaps other franchises could have been spawned from the material used in just this one film. The cast was excellent (as they were in the previous film) and the visuals were remarkable but there were way too many characters fighting for screen time & acknowledgment that the writers/editors should have just stuck to the ""Khan"" story line and fleshed it out instead of the slew of after-thought-like sub-plots which were so clumsily shot and poorly executed, especially towards the climax of the film.",Star Trek Into Darkness
97,burlesonjesse5,VIEWS ON FILM review of Star Trek Into Darkness,8,1 June 2014,"As a kid, I was a huge fan of Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan (1982). It was probably the first movie sequel I ever saw (Jaws 2 doesn't count; I was only 4 years old). At the time, I proclaimed this ""Trek"" gem to be the best darn movie in the world. I also burned it in my brain that hey, sequels just plain rule! Hmmm, how times have changed. I see things differently now. But every once and a while, a glimmer of hope seeps its way through the garbage bin that is movie inferiority. Yes, I'm talking about a few part 2's, a couple part 3's, no 4's though (by the way, Fast & Furious 7 is likely to hit theaters next summer, take heed). Now, if you've read my most recent reviews, it's obvious that I've never been a huge fan of sequels in general. In my mind, they never quite equal the velocity and sheer magnitude of the original. I'm thinking maybe 2% of all them have surpassed the first one in terms of critical acclaim. I mean come on let's face it, not every part II can be The Godfather. So for some spur of the moment reason, I decided to take in the new Star Trek regardless of my beliefs. After all, a critic must review as many movies as possible. It's our job. With popcorn and Diet Coke in hand, I ventured into a wonderful surround sound theater to witness Star Trek Into Darkness. I gotta say it surprised me wholeheartedly. It doesn't try to outdo and outgun the first one (Star Trek (2009) of the re-imagined franchise). Basically, it sticks to that 2009 release in terms of structure and make up from start to finish. J.J. Abrams, a director who has pretty much hit the big time these days, unleashes his signature shiny look to the proceedings and what you get is a fresh, entertaining, and forceful jolt of movie going hysteria that spills itself all over the screen. While viewing the essence of this ""Trek,"" the action sequences reminded me of the swashbuckling gaudiness of Raiders Of The Lost Ark mixed with the sci-fi kinetic motion of Minority Report (Abrams is a big Spielberg fan so there you go). This summer goose bump adventure finds our heroes dealing with a superior villainous specimen who's initial name is Starfleet agent John Harrison. This Harrison later reveals himself to be Khan, a superhuman with uncanny life-recovery mechanisms who's been asleep for 300 years. He awakes from his slumber bent on destroying the enterprise and causing worldwide mass destruction. Khan is played by Benedict Cumberbatch and he's a British actor who's stare could literally cut through glass.I'm gonna turn over a new leaf and not reveal too much so I'll say this, what makes Star Trek Into Darkness such a delight is that there is never a dull moment, never a time when you might look at your watch, and all along you get spine tingling excitement coupled with a feasible, easy to follow script. The actors (Chris Pine, Zoe Saldana, Zachary Quinto for example) make it look effortless and fancy free. They seem to nail their parts and do exactly what's called for. I especially thought Peter Weller as Starfleet Admiral Marcus was a very nice touch as well (I missed you Robocop). As in the previous installment, they replicate the old Star Trek characters from back in the day (you know Spock, Sulu, Scotty, etc.). Most of them do flat out impersonations but that's okay by me (a lot of these guys look like the old characters as well). I'd say they get away with it. But heck, there's not a lot of time to analyze much in the realm of character development because these guys literally get whisked from one exuberant set piece to the next. To put it mildly, fast paced is an understatement when it comes to Star Trek Into Darkness. It's also got a little bit of biting humor as well (the gibber jabber between Captain Kirk and Spock is priceless). Basically, it's a popcorn flick done right and it could satisfy the most defensive of summer moviegoers (I sometimes have my reservations about bloated summer movies that spew hot air so I'm one of these people). So for all you Trekkies and non-Trekkies out there (hey anybody can enjoy this bad boy), I'll leave you with this tag line for any Star Trek adventure: ""to boldly go where no man has gone before."" I'll even throw women in the mix as well. How bout everyone get their shields down and see this sequel. It's one of the few good ones.",Star Trek Into Darkness
98,p-stepien,Boldly falling flat on its nose,3,5 September 2013,"Star Wars is back - force abundant - parading around in Trekkie uniforms and supplanting Wookies with a miniature sidekick Keenser. Any semblance of a cohesive and immersing story has been supplanted by an onslaught of special effects and epic battles, which fail to hit the mark (both logically as well as visually). The flimsy hatchet job script supplied by a trio of vastly overrated scriptwriters Roberto Orci, Alex Kurtzman and Damon Lindelof, flings the Enterprise into a story much bigger than its bite.With the opening sequence the intent is clear: the spectacle itself trumps all. Despite the action being totally illogical the script has the Enterprise resting underwater as part of a reconnaissance mission to a pre-warp civilisation. The idea of the Enterprise emerging from the ocean was just too mouth-watering for Abrams and his crew, but honestly: what happened to waiting quietly off planet and teleporting when necessary? And don't get me started with teleporting... The 'new and improved' Star Trek can teleport people light years away onto vessels moving at warp speed, but can't teleport people off a volcano? Ke? But enough of that for now, as there will be enough banter following regarding the ineptitude of the story. Spock (Zachary Quinto), having almost perished in lava, and Kirk (Chris Pine) return back to Earth, where both are demoted for breaking the cardinal rule of non-intervening into the development of pre-warp species (remember that thing with the Enterprise resting underwater and having to emerge from the ocean? Connect the dots.). The situation however soon changes when the deviously enigmatic terrorist and exceptionally British gentleman Commander John Harrison (Benedict Cumberbatch), bombs an underground facility and then attacks Star Trek command central. This new opponent may yet prove Spock and Kirk biggest foe... and his real name is... da da dam! Guess!Within the framework of script-working gaffes and borrowing of concepts or even entire scenes from previous Star Trek movies, ""Into Darkness"" is a less than enjoyable piece of commercialised Star Trek hogwash. As much as I understand the need for Star Trek to update itself to the modern crowd, dummifying it and amplifying the volume towards a less cerebral Star Wars direction, is clearly a misstep and possibly a damaging hit to the franchise.That said the one thing that works immaculately and offers hope that with a less superficial team of director and scriptwriters the franchise may yet hit warp speed, is the immense cast. Both Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto have immersed into the characters flawlessly, now almost forming their own new legend. The standout character however is Karl Urban as doctor Bones, nailing everything about the character to perfection, with one of the performances of the year. Nonetheless - with detriment to the dynamics of the crew - Bones is underutilised, rarely functioning as the contemplative voice of emotive reason, which made him arguably the best character in all Star Trek history.And naturally there is the baffling revelation: After years of promising that the sequel won't feature Khan Noonien Singh, Benedict Cumberbatch ultimately reveals himself to be the famed Sikh via Mexico (as previously portrayed as Ricardo Montalbán). Naturally true Star Trek fans - to which I do not belong - had cognitive clicks the moment 72 missiles were mentioned, but this big reveal was evident pretty early on. Given the distinctly English features and traits, Cumberbatch must be widely held as a weird actor choice and awkward retcon of the origins of Star Trek's most famous villain, possibly in a vain attempt to deflect suspicions away from Khan as to the true identity of Commander John Harrison. Additionally Khan's more complex motivations, as presented in the original series and film, were supplanted by hints of genocidal warfare, making him a paper-thin villain dedicated solely to mindless destruction and death. What's worse Khan's preference of brain over brawn, as a preferred weapon of choice, gets hijacked.It would have however served a better purpose to just stick with the original Khan or just forgo the notion of using this character at all. Especially if you don't intent to retcon the famous genetic wars of the 1990s (remember those times?). With this superficial usurping of Khan, J.J. Abrams further damages his own reboot, underlined by a ridiculous ""Khaaaannnn!!!"" moment during the final act. Furthermore after the idiotic re-imagination of Star Trek science and the introduction of trans-warp teleportation (which unfortunately was not buried away into oblivion, but actually utilised by Khan to escape from Earth into Klingon territory), Abrams throws in the kitchen sink by giving Khan's blood the power of guaranteeing immortality and resurrecting the dead. Naturally the implications of both 'discoveries' are devastating: What's the point in trekking, if you can teleport yourself across the galaxy within seconds? And where's the drama, if all sickness, death and so forth have been rendered null and void? Whether or not future instalments will somehow manage to avoid falling into the grave dug out by Abrams is questionable, given the only surefire ways of surpassing these problems are either rebooting the reboot or just magnanimously intentionally avoiding any mention of their existence.",Star Trek Into Darkness
99,rannynm,Hits it Out of the Park! Filled with Comedy and Action,10,20 May 2013,"Satirical, Emotional and Epic are the only words to describe the new movie Star Trek Into Darkness. I got a chance to visit the Paramount lot for an exclusive screening of this movie, which left me in awe and thrill. Although this movie is a sequel to the previous Star Trek series, movie goers who are not familiar with the story will understand the plot clearly. The actors portray their characters very well thanks to the director, J.J Abrams. The scenery and set for the futuristic year of 2240 are so vivid and realistic, audience members will forget they are in the year 2013. This movie is also produced for the IMAX 3D, which puts all the explosions and fight scenes in your face. The relationship of all the characters on the iconic Starship Enterprise are deep and meaningful. Captain Kirk (Chris Pine) and Spock (Zachery Quinto) develop a brotherly love through the struggles they conquer. The Villain, Khan (Benedict Cumberpatch) is a scary two-faced character that will leave the audience guessing his fate until the very end. Not only does the main star achieve his role perfectly, but the co-stars also do an superb job. The writers, Roberto Orci, Alex Kurtzman and Damon Lindelof successfully add comedy in the script to bring an emotional roller coaster to the audience. The set ranges from modern skyscrapers to futuristic spaceships. The designers portrayed the theme very well, using many computer generated images to create the year of 2240 in a way that makes it seem so real. The 3D element is an added bonus because it brings the action up close. The beginning scene has lots of running and fighting sequences and yet it is all filmed in such detail that the characters seem like they are going to run off screen.After watching this movie, my passion for Star Trek has been sparked! I rate this movie 5 out of 5 because it balances the comedy and action scenes so well. It has multiple themes taking place but the on-going theme ""the power of friendship can build you or destroy you"" is present throughout. This movie contains a hand-full of violence but is not bloody or graphic. The action sequences, violence and realistic make-up could be scary for younger audience members so, I recommend this for ages 13 to18. This movie has sparked an interest in Star Trek for me and hopefully, it will do the same to you. Reviewed by Patrick N, KIDS FIRST! Film Critic.",Star Trek Into Darkness
100,Rob_Taylor,Star Trek: Into Parody,6,21 August 2013,"Well, I did enjoy it for the most part, but it is a far paler shadow of even its predecessor, much less the old Trek films. Because this movie was at times grimace inducing or caused groans of pain (from me beating my head against the seat in front of me), I cannot in good faith give a serious review of it. And, since it's been a long time since I did one of these, here it comes...Things I learned from this movie which make no sense whatsoever...1. Cold fusion devices really are cold. Cold enough to freeze a volcano!2. Water literally just offshore is more than deep enough to hide an entire starship!3. Old Spock is now the ""We don't know what to do, so we'll call him!"" guy.4. Khan is so skilled at everything that he can manage to design and build super photon torpedoes and then manage to squirrel away his entire crew of frozen supermen inside them, and nobody ever notices the corpsicles are missing from wherever they were being stored!5. The new Klingons are pussies.6. Sound only exists in a vacuum if its dramatically necessary.7. Gigantic crashing starships displace no air as they fall.In addition, here's a handy checklist of previous Trek lore that Abrams felt it was important to include. I can only presume that these were included so that people would remember they were supposedly watching a Star Trek movie and not some hokey sci-fi space actioner riffing on it.1. Old Spock in movie? Check! 2. Destroyed Klingon moon Praxis? Check!3. The needs of the many...yada, yada...? Check! 4. Reference to Harry Mudd? Check! 5. Tribble? Check! 6. KHAAAAAAN!? Check!These items are most important, because otherwise you will wonder whether you are watching a Star Trek movie.You know, I was quite excited when I heard Abrams was doing the new Star Wars movie. But now I'm dreading it. He needs to ditch his Larry, Mo and Curly writing team for a start. Those stooges are seriously dragging him down. I don't think they've had an original idea in years and its painful to watch anything they've written these days. J.J., take a chance on a new scriptwriter, please! The Yuk-yuk brothers aren't doing you any favours.Back to Star Trek Into Darkness...No, it isn't that good. Eye candy and explosions, sometimes hard to see due to the overuse of the trademark Abram's lens-flare. Physics that makes no sense and a plot that was hacked up (furball-like!) in a short time indeed.The only real creativity in this movie are the designs of the CGI artists, prop makers and costume departments.SUMMARY: Give your five year old kid a cup of strong coffee and hand him a model of the Enterprise. I guarantee he'll be more entertaining to watch, but not as manic or hyperactive as this film. Overdone, Under-scripted and weak in comparison to every Star Trek movie before it. Older fans of the franchise might be better off just watching The Wrath of Khan instead. At least there the main complaint is simple overacting.FINAL THOUGHT: If starships can land on planets, what the hell are the shuttlecraft for?",Star Trek Into Darkness
101,Matt_Layden,An entertaining sequel that falls a hair short.,8,20 May 2013,"Kirk is given the task of tracking down John Harrison, the man responsible for the death of hundreds of Starfleet Commanders, but upon capturing him, the crew of the enterprise learns of more sinister evils lurking in the darkness. The film starts off Kirk disobeying direct orders from Starfleet in order to save the life of a crew member. The result of this action has him demoted from captain, yet this subplot only lasts 5 minutes as he is thrust back into the role after a devastating hit from the new villain, played by Benedict Cumberbatch. So the film starts off pretty shaky, having something important happen that ultimate goes nowhere for the story. Once Cumberbatch comes on the screen, the film becomes stronger and more focused. This new Star Trek film dances around revenge, sacrifice and friendship. The relationship between Spock and Kirk is stronger, almost a complete 180 from what we saw in the original film. Despite this new strong friendship, Spock still has trouble conveying emotions and thinks more logically than emotionally. This film tries to be bigger and pose a more dangerous threat to our crew than the original, as most sequels do, but in order for that to happen, a lot of the characters are given the short straw. Zoe Saldana, John Cho and Anton Yelchin get the worst of it. Saldana is belittled to a girlfriend role, Cho only drives the ship and Yelchin is thrown into the back and literally does nothing. Pegg, Quinto and Pine take the front roles and of course Cumberbatch steals the show whenever he's on the screen. I can't help be feel a tad disappointed that most of the crew is given little to do, whereas everyone in the original had a moment to shine. Into Darkness is a good entertaining film, that falls a tad bit short of its predecessor. It's still a great film, but there are too many telegraphed scenes that leave the emotion empty because you know where they writers are going to go with it. Big reveals are not shocking and the predictable ending leaves a bad taste in my mouth. They had a chance to throw a big curveball and make us salivate for the next film, but instead we are treated with the ""Spielberg"" ending, something that I think Abrams is becoming more and more guilty of. Those detractors are not enough to make the film a disappointment. It is highly enjoyable popcorn flair. Those worried about lens flare? He tones it down this time!!! YAY!!!!",Star Trek Into Darkness
102,pc95,By the Numbers Action Flick,5,16 June 2013,"(Spoilers)""Star Trek: Into Darkness"" is even less Star Trekish than it's predecessor movie, and not half as well done either. This movie is a partly rehashed and by-the-numbers Space Action movie populated by characters from the original Star Trek series. Some of the actors try to play it like the original cast some don't. The dialog is sitcomish in a bad way with ""witty"" one-liners, and fairly bad effects. There's a bunch of ""action"" masquerading as filler. A bad attempt falls flat to bring in an old-story-line from the original movie series(Star Trek II), and even another needless cameo. By the end of this overlong bore, I was checking my watch fairly often. Why can't directors and writers venture into original territory. I don't mind that they re-did this franchise, but at least put some thought into making better stories. 5/10 - watch on video.",Star Trek Into Darkness
103,brando647,"A Solid, Exciting Second Adventure; Cumberbatch is Awesome",8,22 November 2013,"It seems 2013 is the year of fan rage, as it seems pretty much every major summer blockbuster became the object of their unmitigated anger. While the others seemed to infuriate fans for changing details, STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS appears to fall on the opposite end of the spectrum. People seem aggravated that the filmmakers were too eager to reference the source material (while at the same time, simplifying it for a wider audience). In the case of just about every major movie released this summer, I feel like I'm in the minority of people who actually enjoyed them, and that includes our second adventure in the new STAR TREK universe. It wasn't as good as the first film but it was a solid, exciting film and one of the best we're bound to get. It begins about a year after the events of the first film with Captain Kirk using his command of the U.S.S. Enterprise to violate just about every rule in Starfleet. When an unsanctioned mission to save a primitive race from extinction brings the wrath of his superiors and puts him at odds with Spock, Kirk nearly loses his command position before it every truly gets started, but a terrorist attack on a Starfleet facility in London leaves him with no time to dwell on it. After suffering a personal loss, Kirk makes it his mission to hunt down this terrorist, a man going by the name John Harrison, and bring him to justice. Pursuing the man deep into enemy territory, Kirk finally confronts him to discover that he's more than he appears to be and he might not be the largest threat on the horizon.I really enjoyed INTO DARKNESS. It's not quite as fun on repeat viewings but there's still a lot I loved about this movie. For better or worse, our new STAR TREK is a more action-oriented franchise and the action is always bigger than life. I swear, J.J. Abrams primary mission in these movies is to put the Enterprise through as much pain and suffering as he can to get the money shots that'll put audiences in the seats. We get the Enterprise falling through an atmosphere, rising out of an ocean, rising above clouds, rocketing out of warp speedevery conceivably cool shot he can imagine, he'll find a way to fit it into the movie. And I can't complain because, frankly, the effects in this movie are so awesome that these shots look absolutely amazing. Of course, there are also plenty of brutal hand-to-hand combat and phaser battles because our new TREK isn't a mission of peace. Once relegated to the occasional away mission, action is the name of the game now. The production design, makeup effects, and visual effects are all top notch as you'd expect from a nearly $200 million budget. No one can argue that this movie doesn't look fantastic. It's one of my favorite things about the new franchise; we get an updated, modernized interpretation of a classic universe. Speaking of classic, this movie manages to shoehorn in Klingons, tribbles, and casual references to Harry Mudd and Nurse Chapel.And here is where it seemed to get a lot of negative chatter. The writers and director have been accused of straight-up ripping off STAR TREK II because (and I refuse to consider this a spoiler seeing as how Benedict Cumberbatch is credited as the character on just about any cast list you find) Khan Noonien Singh returns and the movie makes more than a few loving references to THE WRATH OF KHAN. To give my opinion, no, I am not outraged about all the little homages scattered throughout the movie and I believed the plot was different enough from anything done in WRATH OF KHAN to avoid accusations of laziness. Aside from a major sequence near the end of the film (now THAT is a spoiler and I won't ruin it) that felt a little too on-the-nose and was resolved way, way too simply, I had no complaints in that regard. In fact, I thought Cumberbatch was an awesome Khan. He was sinister, intelligent, and an intimidating presence with his cold, calculating demeanor. He gave the constant impression that Khan was a powerful man and always in control of the situation, even when he shouldn't be. He was not as eccentric in the role as Ricardo Montalban in STAR TREK II, but I think he gives an equally powerful performance. You believe this man would slaughter every man and woman in his path to achieve his goals. Alice Eve is another addition to the cast as a weapons expert who invites herself aboard the Enterprise on its manhunt while hiding her own agenda (dodging some more minor spoilers here), but she doesn't do much. I don't know, maybe next time, I guess.If fans want something to complain about, there're better things to complain about. Despite not having watched any of the series regularly in years, I'm pretty sure the Enterprise isn't capable of flying within an atmosphere (which it does twice here), much less landing and taking off. How does the Enterprise go from Earth orbit to the heart of Klingon space in ridiculously fast time? How did Khan teleport across so many systems? Was another high- speed space jump sequence really necessary? I guess it must've been so popular in the first film they felt the need to do it again and up the ante. How was the construction of a warship kept secret in the middle of a bustling stat system? Why was the Klingon moon already destroyed despite not occurring until STAR TREK VI? Although I guess that last one could be copped up to the whole reimagined timeline bit. Regardless, the new franchise is one of mass appeal and, understanding that we probably won't see a STAR TREK film like the old days, this one's pretty good for what it is.",Star Trek Into Darkness
104,begob,Dumb,6,6 June 2017,"A reckless young battleship commander hunts down the assassin of his mentor, but needs the assassin's help to counter a threat from within.Flashy action story with a confused concept. The opening sequence addresses the clash between the ethics of the organisation and the swashbucklng of our hero, but it makes a mockery of the thoughtful side of Star Trek and doesn't tie in with the rest of the plot. After that we're left with something like Top Gun - a barely disguised homage to American military might without any insight on the responsibilities of power or the potential of human collaboration. There is nothing to explain how the organisation could become so corrupted that it promotes war, and the threat from the villain seems to come from nowhere - I don't know much about the Star Trek universe, so I'm just commenting on the internal logic of the story, but the year 1945 seems to have significance.The drama is limited, with simple-minded relationships, and the actors don't need to do much. Best performances are from the villain, with the usual icy British superiority, and a bit of steam rising from Uhuru's passion.The director fits the pieces together fairly tight and throws in plenty of punch-ups, but there's not much of interest.Overall: nothing to distinguish this from a dumb action movie.",Star Trek Into Darkness
105,bob-rutzel-1,Very Good,8,11 September 2013,"Khan ( Benedict Cumberbatch) makes his appearance known by destroying a library archive and also Starfleet headquarters. It is up to Captain James T. Kirk (Chris Pine) and his crew to hot-wire the Enterprise and run down Khan to finish him off.Okay, folks here we go again. Remember this is a reboot, it's not your father's Star Trek. Yeah, I know: tough getting used to.This was very good despite some criticisms. Actually, too much CGI, and Special Effects, - and they were terrific - but that's the trend these days. We still don't like the relationship between Spock (Zachary Quinto) and Uhura (Zoe Saldana) as it's just too forced and no chemistry comes out of it. Spock's explanations are cookie-cutter spiels that we have heard way too often. Nothing new. And, when there is an emergency at hand he'll go on for 2-minutes of why or why not and quote regulations. Yes, the old Spock (Nimoy) did the same thing, but did it quicker. See? This is the perfect example of why we like Capt Kirk who runs on gut feelings and not many words. Old Mr. Sulu (George Takei) always said, ""Aye, Captain"" but the new Mr Sulu (John Cho) says, ""Yes, sir."" We like ""Aye, Captain"" better. What else did you not like? I did not like that the head of Starfleet Command, Admiral Marcus (Peter Weller), goes rogue. We like having confidence in the men at the top. This was uncalled for. Dr. McCoy um "" Bones"" (Karl Urban) played his part exactly like the old Bones (Deforest Kelley) would have. In other words, he complained about everything, but he needed to be more animated. Next time, okay? One day we'd like to see Bruce Greenwood get more screen time. He played Christopher Pike, the first Captain of the Enterprise.Breaths of fresh air: Scotty (Simon Pegg) who said the same thing the old Scotty (Doohan) would say, but the New Scotty has better facial expressions. The other breath of fresh air was Benedict Clumberbatch. We enjoyed his presence, commanding voice and superior delivery. Great job. If any of you saw the movie: ENEMY MINE, then you will enjoy Captain Kirk partnering up with Khan for a brief mission. Say, what?Still very good, even though we get a lot of redundancy. Hey, let's move on and assume the audience knows the characters in and out. Okay? Stop repeating the same things over and over again.Old Spock (Leonard Nimoy) makes an appearance giving guidance to New Spock. This needs to stop or just bring the old crew back and we'd all be the happier for that. Bringing the Old Spock back was not necessary. Nice to see him, but still: not necessary. Chris Pine is a very good Captain Kirk. And, this is hard to believe, but at times he almost looked like William Shatner. Like I said: hard to believe. And, guess what are back? Tribbles. Yes, you read that correctly, and they play an important part later on. Hard to believe, I know. All in all, this was very good. The plot is a good one when you hear Khan spell it all out for Captain Kirk.I know I have to get over comparing new Apples to old Apples. Hey, I 'm working on it. It's just not easy. These reboots bring out the ""yeah, but "" in me. I'm working on it. .. (8/10)Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: Only the S-word was heard at times.

Director J.J. Abrams' 2009 take on the original science fiction TV series more commonly popular among a niche audience transformed it into fun mainstream fare, producing a box office hit that surpassed all previous outings. Remarkably, most of its success was driven by overseas sales, an achievement considering that Star Trek films are known for not travelling too well beyond American shores.In this 2013 follow-up, we take off with a sprint in middle of a mission on an alien planet. Captain James T. Kirk (Chris Pine) and Dr Leonard ""Bones"" McCoy (Karl Urban) are escaping from an aggressive horde of indigenous beings on the brink of civilization. In the meantime, resident paragon of reason and truth First Officer Spock (Zachary Quinto) is tasked with suppressing an erupting volcano with a freezing device. This prologue will feel like déjà vu for viewers who caught the nine-minute trailer preceding the IMAX screenings of The Hobbit back in December. While Spock navigates the complicated waters of a committed relationship with romantic interest Uhura (Zoe Saldana), Kirk lives it up as a bachelor, bedding and picking up attractive aliens at his convenience. The core dynamic between the two leads is quickly established, playing Kirk's brawn and passionate ""leave no man behind"" approach against Spock's adamant reliance on rules and obligations. What makes a great leader? It may be the unlikely melding of these two extreme perspectives.Despite the overall success of the mission, Kirk's superior / mentor Rear Admiral Christopher Pike (Bruce Greenwood) reprimands him for disobeying direct orders, after Spock submits the mission report without his knowledge. This results in his demotion, but the arrangement turns out to be temporary when the bombing of a secret Starfleet intelligence facility and subsequent acts of terrorism throw the Federation into chaos. The adversary is identified to be a certain ex-officer John Harrison (Benedict Cumberbatch), who has gone into hiding in hostile Klingon territory.An enraged Kirk regains command of his ship, the USS Enterprise, and in typical fashion goes right into the fray on a mission to kill. Armed with 72 undetectable missiles of questionable origin and an entire ship crew advising against the operation, there is every indication that things will take a dangerous turn. With the help of the alluring weapons specialist Dr Carol Marcus (Alice Eve), the crew engage an opponent who's practically the equivalent of Superman. Chronicled on an alternate timeline, Into Darkness is a product of creative tinkering with familiar characters while retaining the spirit of creator Gene Roddenberry's stories. It's easy to draw parallels with today's newspaper headlines and political discourse with its accompanying moral quandaries – Star Trek story lines have traditionally been analogies for real-life current affairs – be it the morality of weapons of mass destruction, what constitutes justice, the costs of revenge or whether the utilitarian reasoning is necessarily the best way forward.Although the motivations of individual characters receive screen time, this doesn't translate to greater clarity. Cumberbatch's character in particular could have used a more compelling and convincing backstory, considering how the entire movie (even the promotional material) apparently revolves around him. While the big reveal was delivered well by the British thespian, more attention could have been paid to fleshing out the trigger points and rationale.Into Darkness is polished to such a high shine that it's almost blinding: Gleaming spaceships calmly sail against a backdrop of black space and the impeccably tailored uniforms are so crisp it's distracting. Perhaps even more distracting are the lens flares reflecting off nearly every frame, which felt artificial when used so liberally, despite fitting the space travel premise by approximating solar glares and connoting ""hi-tech. That said, the action is first- class, with thrilling aerial chases, fight scenes and set pieces of total destruction that justify the price of an IMAX ticket.Scene-stealing star of the movie Cumberbatch is the cool personification of warped morality: empty of empathy, brilliantly manipulative and ruthlessly efficient both mentally and physically. Having bulked up considerably since his last outings in War Horse and Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy, he rises up to the occasion for his numerous action scenes and fully deserves the praise his co-stars have lavished on him. Quinto delicately portrays Spock's emotional growth and journey towards maturity, spurring a few memorable laugh-out-loud scenes. Suitably rough-around-the-edges, Pines' earnestness is put to good use as a leader whose first instinct is to protect the ones he loves despite his heavy responsibilities.As Abrams has shared, the film wasn't designed solely for die-hard Trekkies but targeted to movie fans in general. It establishes itself as a standalone movie or it can interpreted as part of the overall series, ultimately appealing to the mass audience as a whole. One shouldn't let unfamiliarity with the original series hinder a chance to catch this. www.moviexclusive.com",Star Trek Into Darkness
107,TedStixonAKAMaximumMadness,"While it somewhat misses its mark in areas that feel like retreads of prior films, ""Star Trek Into Darkness"" is still another strong win for J.J. Abram's rebooted series.",7,1 December 2013,"Since it's release just over six months ago, J.J. Abram's sequel ""Star Trek Into Darkness"" has been the subject of much debate, scrutiny and back-and-forth's between fans and film-goers. Despite enjoying a very strong critical reception and generally very positive fan reception, there are some who are very critical of the film's merits, themes, storyline and characters.Where do I fall in this debate? Somewhere in the crowd who quite liked the movie, yet also is open and understanding about the common fan complaints, and able to acknowledge that it's not a perfect sequel.This time around, the crew of the Enterprise is sent on a mission of revenge against renegade Starfleet Commander John Harrison (Benedict Cumberbatch) after he murders Admiral Pike (Bruce Greenwood in a small but significant role) and repeatedly attacks Starfleet bases in several terrorist-like attacks. However, various revelations about the nature of the mission will force Captain Kirk (Chris Pine) to question not only who Harrison really is, but also if his Starfleet superiors are even on his side.This is a film of many, many strengths.For starters, the cast is unanimously magnificent. Newcomer Benedict Cumberbatch makes for one heck of a compelling villain, giving Harrison much mystery, emotion and a very threatening nature. He's a phenomena in the film, and is easily the biggest highlight. Other newcomers including Peter Weller and Alice Eve are also fantastic in their supporting roles.And the returning cast is an absolute blast. Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto stand out as Kirk and Spock, our two leads who are the focus of the film. Karl Urban and Simon Pegg also give a nice balance in their slightly lighter-hearted roles of McCoy and Scotty. And John Cho, Zoe Saldana and Anton Yelchin round out the cast, giving admirable performances as Sulu, Uhura and Chekov, although in somewhat smaller roles than the prior film, as the main focus is predominately on Kirk, Spock and Harrison.Abram's visual direction, as in the first film, is a blast and a half. He's one of the only working directors today who has figured out how to properly use the ""shaky cam"" style of camera-work. And his design choices, choice in shot and composition, and visual storytelling are first-class. (Although I will join the crowd in saying his apparent fetish for lens-flares does get old.)The set and costume design is fabulous, and it really feels like an accurate depiction of the future. The effects are absolutely awe- inspiring, from several deep-space battles, to a great sequence where out heroes are forced to drift through space from one ship to another, it's all amazing. And the musical score by Michael Giacchino, as in the first film, is an emotional, memorable masterpiece of sound, and is one of the highlights.The slight problems in the film lay in the strong, but flawed script by Roberto Orci, Alex Kurtzman and Damon Lindelof. Now, I know they are popular guys to hate on due to their other projects, but I do feel these three are talented writers when they are working with good material. They also are (unfortunately) capable of mistakes. But I don't hate their work by any means, and I do think the script for ""Star Trek Into Darkness"" is well-written, tightly paced and generally tells a very good story.However, there is a problem that is very hard to delve into without going into spoiler territory. So I will have to remain vague with this, as I don't like giving away spoilers in my reviews. And that is the fact that this film contains many callbacks and references to a famous ""Trek"" film from the original series. And in fact, it could be argued that this film is almost an unofficial remake of a certain ""Trek"" film from the classic series. And in that sense, this film does pale in comparison, and it unfortunately does negatively impact this film. There's simply no way to watch this without comparing it to this other ""Trek"" film, and it does lower the score of this one a little bit, as it comes off as more unoriginal, less polished and worse written as a result. Just as I may give an official remake a lower score than an original, this film just isn't as good as the original film it is obviously trying to emulate, and thus it deserves a lower score.Still, that fairly major complaint being said (and it is a major complaint, as it is a huge elephant in the room while watching this movie), this is still a fun, solid, well-made sequel to the 2009 reboot. And I do think it's easily well-worth checking out.I give ""Star Trek Into Darkness"" a good 7 out of 10. It's not perfect, but it's a lot of fun, and is an admirable film.",Star Trek Into Darkness
108,mike48128,It's Great but hard-to follow,9,15 June 2013,"No movie is perfect, hence the ""9"". If you want the complete storyline, read one of the other 700 reviews. (I really miss Roger Ebert.)This review is all about an impression of the movie from an avid Star Trek fan.It's one of the best ""Star Trek"" films ever made. More action at breakneck speed and more killer EFX than several old Star Trek movies combined. Never a dull moment, although somewhat hard to follow. The CGI is flawless and everything looks real. Spock is a lot more ""human"" and Kirk acts like the school-boy we always knew he was. Carol Markus is amazing (and cut!) and what about those cat-aliens in bed? (At least they're not green.) Lots of humor. Plot holes abound: How was Khan planing on getting those ""Human Popsicles"" out of the missiles before they all exploded? Why is Khan the only revived superhuman? Why isn't Christopher Pike in a wheelchair? The director provides very little plot exposition about the main characters and assumes you already know everybody. This is both good and bad, but it saves 15 minutes of time, and that's good. As always, there are hundreds of crew members, but you only see a few of them except when the ship is being blown-up in a great ""dogfight"" between starships, in space. I love the alien with the ""glass brain"" in his head! A lot of twists on the old ""Star Trek 2"" plot. Some familiar lines reused (good). In this version, Kirk takes the massive fatal radiation dosage instead of Spock.(O.K.) The way he is revived and cured, with magic ""Khan"" blood via a Tribble, is hokey; but he can't die so early in the series, can he? In this version, Khan is almost a ""Superman""; he's invulnerable, but can't fly. Spock is stronger too, as he chases Khan thru the skies in a fight on what looks like airborne ""garbage trucks"". Please get rid of ""Scotty's annoying alien sidekick"". A far better film than several ""weak"" ones in the original series. (Stay away from whales.) Please, Paramount, reopen a new ""Star Trek"" museum, at a major theme park!",Star Trek Into Darkness
109,Sergeant_Tibbs,It's entertaining but a shame it doesn't touch the bar that the first reached.,6,26 June 2013,"I never watched the original Star Trek and thought I wouldn't be a fan but I ended up really enjoying Abrams' first 2009 offering in the modern reboot. Although it could be convoluted, it's bright, charming and captures the fresh iconography of the show in a very cinematic way. It's a shame that Star Trek Into Darkness doesn't feel so fresh. There's something about the film that feels like it hasn't strived for iconography despite taking on such an iconic part of the mythology. It treads in the previous films footsteps as far as the look and charm goes but it fails to re-involve me into the characters.I remember when I first finished watching the first one in the cinema and being very ready for sequels and all their adventures. Unfortunately, Into Darkness just feels like ""another"" adventure rather than anything bigger. Perhaps its due to the rushed nature of the film. Yes, it has emotional highs and lows with the characters and sometimes they work, but the action is non-stop with either un-assured stakes or too much at stake to be believable. The excitement doesn't hold up and it feels like it skips its climax. However, it's still an entertaining blockbuster and Benedict Cumberbatch is brilliant as the villain. It's just a shame it doesn't touch the bar that the first reached.6/10",Star Trek Into Darkness
110,Terryfan,Into Darkness,8,2 June 2015,"Now as a long time fan of Star Trek, I was looking forward to seeing this film and it was really awesome to watch in theaters.After the success of the 2009 Reboot of Star Trek, you know fans would want a sequel and we got one that boldly goes where no one has gone before, Into Darkness.The cast from the 2009 film reprises their roles Chris Pine as Captain Kirk, Zachary Quinto as Mr.Spock, Zoe Saldana as Uhura, Karl Urban as Dr.McCoy aka Bones, Simon Pegg as Scotty, John Cho as Mr.Sulu, and Anton Yelchin as ChekovWe are introduce to new cast members Alice Eve as Dr.Carol Marcus and her father Marcus played by Peter Weller. The Film main antagonist is John Harrison who is played by Benedict Cumberbatch and his performance is a winner in this film his voice also commanded your attention. Peter's character is also a commanding figure as well.The effects for this film are superb it just proves that Star Trek is one of the true masters of wowing their fans with their special effects and to give them justice you have to watch the film.The acting in the film is well balance as well as the story that is truly like it's subtitle into darkness as Star Trek has done it sometimes but this one you have to watch to understand Also the music again is what you would expect from Star Trek and it is just a well done score to match every bit of this film as you feel many emotions from the music.The only complain about this film I have is that it could have done more but we made do with what we got I still praise the special effects the plot and the performances of the cast. Overall if you enjoy Star Trek and are a long time fan I say give this film a tryI give Star Trek Into Darkness an 8 out of 10",Star Trek Into Darkness
111,OJT,A near perfect 2013 update of the Star Trek Enterprise,9,10 May 2013,"I've always been a trekkie as compared to a Star wars fan. But being quite impressed with JJ Abrams first Star Trek outing in 2009, which currently is number 225 on the IMDb top 250 list, I most certainly can bargain for this one as well. I enjoyed the first one, but THIS IS STAR TREK of 2013.Again, as in the TV series we are introduced to an enemy so strong, routed back to some 300 years ago. A dangerous enemy which should have been extinct, but thanks to old fashioned cryo-technology of which we here today already as discarded as useless, of course.We get the morals of which we love. We get to see Earth as star fleet headquarters in London. We get to see the out of space San Francisco, even the real Spock in a time warp. In a way this is a homage to the old series in a way I found it difficult to manage. And then it's also an update to what it has to show off in 2013 in big budget. Because the TV series was low budget TV, made out of brilliant ideas.This is grand sci-fi. A grand story with everything that is needed. It's a story that stands on it's own feet, as well as giving the right nods to the old series. All of them. The ship. The logos. The ideas. The colors. The beams, warps and shields. The crew. The Star Trek! Enjoy the ride, and wait fore more. This felt like a prequel to all that we loved back then. How many film will we see in the future Star Trek franchise, or should I say enterprise, now when they go out on the five year journey? You can only image! I really start to imagine what JJ Abrams and his staff can do to save the Star Wars enterprise/franchise, because he will! What a relief for those who love the Star Wars! I never really did, and though it got worse and worse. But I think JJ Abrams visions will make Star Wars what it should have been, updated to 2014-15-16 as well. Old Sci-Fi ideas get reborn by JJ Abrams, and so it will with Star Wars. Most guaranteed. JJ Abramns is the one and only sci-fi God for old sci-fi franchises!",Star Trek Into Darkness
112,DJAkin,This movie had me screaming PAIN and SUFFERING!!,1,16 May 2013,"I wanted to like this movie, I really did. Jake has been ranting about it. But instead I hated it. This movie had no darkness it it for being called INTO DARKNESS. It was mostly warm and fuzzy. There was absolutely NO GORE in it. The part where Spock talks to ""Future Spock"" on the computer screen was never explained. And then there is the KLINGONS! They looked cool but only had about 60 seconds of screen time. Why was Kirk's hair always messed up? Doesn't he have a comb?Benedict Cumberbatch plays the role of Khan very well but everyone else is pretty lame, especially Spock who always has his lips pursed together. What I didn't like about Kahn is that he was not as evil seeming as the Ricardo Montablan version. I think this movie is targeted mainly for children. The action sequences look like action figures in space and it's very obvious that it's CG. Every story ever written for TNG, TOS is better than this. J.J. Abrams's version of Star Trek has absolutely NOTHING in common with the ideas and visions of Gene Roddenberry. It has none of the MAGIC. Oh, and having Dr. Carol Marcus change uniforms in a shuttle while Kirk is asked to turn his back, is just a pathetic excuse to see a hot chick in her underwear, and is completely unnecessary to the story. Having Kirk die while saving the ship instead of Spock and having Spock yell KHAN instead of Kirk was laughable and these parts were just swapped from The Wrath of Khan. This drivel doesn't boldly go anywhere, it's a face paced action adventure film without any real star trekking involved. So many things are NOT REALISTIC and silly in this.suck as how they run for miles and never get tired, ignore the Prime Directive, freeze a volcano, get demoted, get repromoted, ooh there's a bad admiral in star fleet (Star Trek VI) blow up, smash, do the Millennium-Falcon-sideways-to-escape-the Klingons, die and come back to life using super- human blood (Battlestar Galactica), jump hundreds of feet and don't brake an ankle. The ending was pulled directly out of The Wrath of Khan, albeit with Kirk and Spock on opposite sides of the radiation screen doors. Then when they are in their formal uniforms they ALL look like Nazi's. Shame on you JJ. I want my two hours back.",Star Trek Into Darkness
113,rivertam26,100% Grade A entertainment!,9,15 May 2013,"I didn't want to see the 2009 reboot but I did and I absolutely loved it. I don't consider myself a trekkie but I've watched my fair share of Star Trek courtesy of my father and friends. So I consider myself to be somewhat decently versed in the source material. I just thought that first film was just absolutely brilliant and despite all the positive buzz and the incredible trailers and TV spots I was pretty sure it just wouldn't be able to, well I'm happy to say I was wrong. Cause Star Trek Into Darkness is a complete blast the best summer movie in years. Smart, addictively engaging, funny, action packed and emotionally resonant. I'm not gonna run down the plot for you but those familiar with the original films are in for some surprises. J.J. Abrams once again adds an intense visual zest with a pacing that just doesn't quit. The film like the first is an absolute roller coaster ride. And it does what good sequels should it expands lightly on the original films mythology and as well as adding new welcome additions and deepens the characters and their relationships. I can't imagine him not doing more of these films especially since they are so perfectly casted and he just executes them so well. Hopefully he will stay in this galaxy instead of taking over another franchise . Because he's stumbled onto real cinematic magic here. Star Trek Into Darkness is 100% grade A entertainment and one of the best films of the year and one of the best summer movies ever! 4.5/5",Star Trek Into Darkness
114,Troy_Campbell,A scintillating blockbuster.,9,24 May 2013,"Kicking off with a frenetic opening scene where Kirk (Chris Pine), now Captain of the U.S.S. Enterprise, breaks regulations to save the life of best pal Spock (Zachary Quinto - again a standout), Into Darkness sets a fast pace from the get go and seldom lets up. The two hour plus runtime flies by with action sequence after action sequence - each one somehow topping the last, all the way to the utterly mind-blowing crashing-spaceship climax - that boasts expert choreography and a sense of real danger paired with flawless CGI and sensational use of the third dimension. The characters and story aren't given short shrift mind you. The testy friendship between polar opposites Kirk and Spock is given ample time to grow; the narrative is intelligent, unpredictable and bold in its choices; and, in this film's biggest improvement on its predecessor, the villain is granted an intriguing backstory and is subsequently explored in great depth. That the mysterious terrorist and one man army John Harrison is so compelling boils down to the phenomenal performance from Benedict Cumberbatch; his vengeful antagonist is physically powerful, dramatically commanding and simply electric, all but stealing the show in the process. It's the merging of all these elements, along with Michael Giacchino's unsurprisingly regal score and the spot-on humour impeccably placed throughout, that ensures this a spellbinding journey from start to finish. The standard of sequel Iron Man 3 was aiming for but couldn't reach, J.J. Abrams' follow up to his 2009 smash hit is the most scintillating blockbuster of the year so far.",Star Trek Into Darkness
115,Pumpkin_Man,A Nerd-gasm for all Trekkie Fans!!!,10,18 May 2013,"This was a great sci-fi movie and a great Star Trek film in general. Lots of action, plenty of humor, surprises, emotion, and a brilliant twist to one of the classic Star Trek Films. One scene actually brought me to tears. After a mission has gone bad, Captain James Kirk is demoted to first officer of the Enterprise, with his predecessor, Admiral Christopher Pike reassuming command. When Starfleet Command is attacked by John Harrison, Kirk and his crew journey to a Klingon planet in search for Harrison. What follows is an all out war with Harrison, the Klingons, and a rogue Admiral. If you're a Trekkie, I highly recommend STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS!!!",Star Trek Into Darkness
116,RNMorton,"Excellent, beats the first",9,18 May 2013,"I am really enjoying the re-revival of cultural stuff from when I was a child of the 60's, particularly Star Trek and most of the Marvel movies. I have always felt a good Star Trek movie is pretty much equal parts characters, plot, dialogue and believable special effects. In the first run of six Star Trek movies - I don't consider Next Generation to be ""Star Trek"" - they got thinner on the plot as the movies went along (sort of like in the original TV series). In its second revival this one is actually better than the first. I think Pine has more range than Shatner as Kirk and also can show a vulnerable side, although for a 60's TV show Shatner's bluster was effective. I can't speak as highly for Quinto, but I don't think there's a man alive who can out-Spock Nimoy. Nimoy WAS Spock so that Quinto acts like Nimoy more than he acts like Spock, if that makes sense. That said, Quinto comes across as too accessible and almost effeminate. They need to show a tougher, quieter side of Spock next time around. No one would ever call Nimoy effeminate. Urban does much better as McCoy than in the last movie. Scotty does very well despite his visual difference from the original, Uhura and Sulu are fine also. This movie starts out a little slow and over-CGI'ed -- a common major problem with current films -- but picks up speed as it goes along. I like the references to the original Star Trek stories but of course they risk credibility each time they do that in terms of series to series continuity. Admiral Marcus could have been played by Robert Lansing but he's been gone for years. Very well done, keep 'em coming!",Star Trek Into Darkness
117,Jeremy_Urquhart,An old review from 2013 I found,7,20 April 2020,"So in one of my latest reviews, I described the recent World War Z as a fairly good summer blockbuster action movie that doesn't really succeed in being much more than that. I would kinda say the same thing about Star Trek Into Darkness, although it is a better movie that World War Z, and I personally got more enjoyment out of it than I did with World War Z. But if you're not a huge Star Trek fan, and you're looking for something that's more than just action, thrills, and pure entertainment, you may come away a little disappointed.
(Spoilers ahead, btw).Now, to say I came into this movie being unfamiliar with the franchise would be an understatement- this was actually the first Star Trek film I've ever watched, so I went in with very little expectations. So I'm really not the kind of guy who can tell you whether fans or non-fans of Star Trek are gonna like this more. On one hand, this is a much faster-paced, more action-packed film than what fans of older Star Trek may be used to (I know enough about Star Trek to know that at least the original series and early movies were fairly low budget affairs with limited sets and special effects, but a strong emphasis on writing, science-y futuristic stuff, and character development). But on the other hand, there were a lot of shout-outs to previous Star Trek-y stuff that I know went over my head- just because I don't know what's being referenced doesn't mean I can't spot a reference being made. Like, I'm someone who knew Cumberbatch's character being revealed to be Khan was a shout-out to the second Star Trek film, but I didn't get why it was such a big deal- apparently it's a big surprise or something, hence the reason I've given out a few spoiler warnings in this review. I actually remember visiting the IMDB page for Into Darkness about a month before the film hit theatres, and Cumbersnatch was listed among the other cast members as playing ""Khan."" This didn't last long though, and soon it was changed to show that he played the blandly named ""John Harrison."" So I don't know, someone screwed up there big time or something. Didn't bother me personally though- I had heard the name Khan before, and was pretty sure he was a bad guy, seeing as the title for Star Trek II implied he was wrathful or something, but I still wasn't very familiar with the character.Cucumberbatch plays a terrorist who Kirk and his crew are asked to take down. He darts around between a few different planets causing havoc before revealing his true motives and helping to reveal a big space conspiracy. Then action, witty banter, and lens flares ensue.This is a very nice movie to watch on as big a screen as possible. The special effects are very impressive, the colour scheme is varied, and the action scenes are fast and exciting. The controversial Abrams lens flare makes its way into this film, and the amount of it can be downright hilarious at times. I think it'd be cool in moderation, but the amount Mr. Abrams insists on using it can get pretty annoying. Well, it's his trademark, so I guess... Whatever. If he's so deadset on using it so much then what's a novice, unpopular blogger like myself going to do to stop him.The rest of his direction is actually really good though. This film does have a great style to it, a little bit gritty but not overtly so, with enough shiny, vivid colours to stop things from getting too dark and depressing. The camerawork is clean and there's pretty much no frustrating use of shaky cam. The actions scenes are well-shot and well-edited. It's a damn good-looking film, and without quite so much lens flare would probably look even better. I'm looking forward to seeing what Abrams will do with his direction of the upcoming Star Wars: Episode 7- I think it's in good hands.I liked the acting and writing too. The crew all have great chemistry together, and I thought all the banter between Spock and Kirk was really well done. These two characters felt surprisingly real, and I enjoyed watching them throughout the film. There were some good supporting performances too- I particularly enjoyed Karl Urban, Simon Pegg, and Peter Weller.Oh yes, Benedict Cabbagepatch needs a mention too. I thought he played a really good villain in this movie. I haven't seen him in anything else yet (I may watch Sherlock eventually- heard nothing but great things about it), but I gotta say, he does creepy really well. He successfully portrays a formidable foe in this movie, and I while I can't quite say he absolutely stole every scene he was in, he did give a very good villainous performance. Due to his recent surge in popularity (which I think has something to do with his awesomely awful name... oh, and the fact he seems like a pretty damn good actor) I think we can expect to see him in a few more Hollywood films in the future; or maybe another Star Trek? After all, they just kinds put Khan into some giant freezer or something at the end of this film.There's a few problems with this movie though, none of which necessarily prevent the film from being really entertaining, but they do kind of stop the movie from achieving much more than just being really really good entertainment.
Thinking about the overly complicated plot will do you no good- this is a roller-coaster ride, with a relentless plot that piles shocking reveal upon shocking reveal, and a few minor plot details don't make a whole lot of sense if you think about them too hard and try to put everything in the movie into context. ""Don't think... Watch.""Too much distracting lens flare- we've been over this already though. Just make sure to tone it down in Star Wars 7 please Mr. Abrams (2020 EDIT: he did!)""KHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAN!!"" Nah, actually this moment kinda worked, but can we seriously stop this thing in movies where the main character is ""killed off"" towards the end of the movie, but then brought make to life like, 6 minutes later? I think it's just such a lazy ass-pull, and it's really getting old. Although this movie didn't do it worse than a certain superhero last year who appeared to make the ultimate sacrifice but somehow escaped in order to keep unstable fan boys from killing themselves... not mentioning any names or anything.The movie kind of shrugging its shoulders and not really giving much attention to the likely tens of thousands of people who would've died when Khan played ten pin bowling at the film's climax, with his gigantic ship serving as the ball and at least a dozen skyscrapers playing the part of the bowling pins. Hollywood films just kind of gloss over the deaths huge sequences of destruction like this would cause, and it kind of bothers me. I haven't seen Man of Steel yet, but apparently there's thousands of implied deaths in that one too thanks to a ton of buildings getting destroyed.But, you know, all those flaws are kind of minor, and very personal (to me) too. This is a good, fun movie that no action or sci-fi fan should pass up seeing. Whether or not you're familiar with Star Trek shouldn't harm your enjoyment of Star Trek Into Darkness too much- it's a light, accessible, thoroughly entertaining film that's well worth your time and money.*Insert well known Star Trek quote here as a way of finishing the review in a stylish and funny manner.*",Star Trek Into Darkness

119,suite92,Abrams' Star Trek; perhaps not Roddenberry's.,6,24 May 2014,"In this second Star Trek film of the Abrams era, Kirk and Spock are still running the Enterprise, and are still doing it in amateurish fashion. However, there is a lot of action, excitement, and relief when difficulties are overcome.In completing the mission in the opening sequence, Kirk violates the prime directive in order to save Spock who was doing the last part of saving a new species of sentient beings. Sigh. Kirk loses command of the Enterprise.Admiral Pike finagles getting Kirk to be his First Officer just before there is an attack on a critical Star Fleet installation. The attack leads to a high level conclave of Star Fleet officers. Kirk figures this out just before the attack, and manages to blunt (but not stop) its effects. There are heavy losses. Kirk gets back the Enterprise, and is ordered to find and kill the perpetrator. His crew is given special weapons to accomplish this.Kirk's quarry is traced to a deserted part of Kronos, the Klingon homeworld. The quarry's real name is Khan who is the maximal result of a eugenics experiment done many years earlier on Earth. Admiral Marcus (Pike's superior) had hoped to use Khan against an array of future enemies, such as the Klingons. Khan and Marcus had a falling out, though, and the whole dynamics of the film is derived from that.For the Federation to be brought back to an even keel, Marcus' vision of endless war has to be put aside, and Khan has to be contained somehow. Just to make things for fun, Carol Marcus, the daughter of the Admiral, stows away on the Enterprise.So, will the Enterprise crew be up for it? -----Scores-----Cinematography: 7/10 For the most part, the blending of CGI with real photography was well done. I saw why there are so many posted complaints about lens flare, however.Sound: 6/10 The often symphonic music seemed an odd choice, and only amplified my misgivings about the film.Acting: 7/10 Good, except for the miscasting of the pivotal character Khan. I liked the performances of Karl Urban, John Cho, Simon Pegg, Anton Yelchin, Bruce Greenwood, and Peter Weller quite a lot.Screenplay: 5/10 Usually, I watch action films in one sitting with no breaks whatsoever. This property took me four days to watch, since it just did not interest me that much, at any stage. The three principals all seemed emotionally childish and short of training for their chosen profession. It seemed utterly unlikely that such incompetence could produce good results in very difficult situations.",Star Trek Into Darkness
120,hnt_dnl,Superb/superior follow-up to a very good reboot!,10,20 April 2014,"I am a monumental fan of Star Trek:TOS, truly one of the most original (no pun intended!) series of all time. But I generally disliked all of the ""sequel"" series that came in the 80s and 90s. None of them engaged me the way TOS did. I can STILL watch the 60s series episodes and be firmly engaged, but you'd have to PAY me to re-watch TNG, DS9, Voyager, or Enterprise! All of them are in their own ways kind of clunky and generic copies of what TOS stood for (although DS9 came the closest to getting it right). And don't EVEN get me started on those atrocious TNG movies, which were just tepid extensions of that overrated, tepid series! I'm a Kirk/Spock/McCoy guy, not a Picard/Data/Sisko/Janeway guy.So when the 2009 Star Trek reboot happened with all my favorite characters, I was highly anticipating it, and overall, I very much liked that movie. That said, I understood the detractors and hardcore Trekkies who felt that it wasn't quite ""Star Trek"". The film, while very fast-paced, exciting, and fun, definitely lacked the deep characterizations from TOS, even though it contained all of the original characters. But where I give that film a pass is that it shows the characters when they were MUCH younger, inexperienced, and just Starfleet cadets, so it made sense that they didn't have the depth of the originals. But I definitely concur that the immediate sequel HAD to up the ante and be deeper, and did it ever! I am glad to say that STAR TREK:INTO DARKNESS (2013) tops it's very good 2009 predecessor by leaps and bounds and one can actually now see these still-young characters will become the deep characters from TOS. I dare say that this film is easily the second best Star Trek film of all time, with ""Wrath of Khan"" of course being top dog (an incredible irony)! My very first kudos must go to Chris Pine's portrayal as Captain James T. Kirk. I personally think that Pine was the true acting standout in this highly engrossing film. While in the first film, Pine's Kirk was a raging, hormonal hellion cadet, in this one, Kirk is actually given layers as the very young Captain of the Starship Enterprise, and we can literally see Kirk evolve throughout the course of the film both personally and professionally. While the first film was almost more of an ensemble, in this one, I felt that Kirk was the star, with everyone else supporting. Back from the first film are the other famous original series characters played by the same actors: Zachary Quinto (as Spock), Karl Urban (as McCoy), Zoe Saldana (as Uhura), John Cho (as Sulu), Anton Yelchin (as Chekov), and in particular Simon Pegg (as Scotty) all fit well into their respective roles and continue to be impressive.The plot of STID starts with a mysterious figure named John Harrison (played with unapologetic coldness by Benedict Cumberbatch) blackmailing a London Starfleet operative into bombing the secret Section 31 facility in exchange for Harrison giving the man the cure that will save his cancer-stricken daughter's life. After the bombing, the head of Starfleet, Admiral Marcus (excellently played by veteran Peter Weller in an overdue welcome back!) convenes all of Starfleets Captains and First Officers into an emergency meeting and reveals that Harrison, a genetically engineered man with high intellect and superhuman strength, was an agent of Section 31, whose purpose was to develop advanced weaponry in anticipation of future conflicts. But then Harrison went rogue. During the meeting, Kirk (recently demoted to First Officer after violating the Prime Directive at the film's outset) tells the re-instated Enterprise leader Admiral Pike (wonderfully reprised by veteran actor Bruce Greenwood) as well as the rest of the convened that he thinks Harrison has set them up, which comes to fruition as Harrison attacks the meeting, and in the process kills Admiral Pike.Admiral Marcus re-instates Kirk as Enterprise Captain and tasks him on an off-the-books mission to pursue Harrison across the neutral zone into an unpopulated location on the Klingon homeworld Kronos where Harrison is hiding out. As part of Kirk's unofficial orders, he is to use 72 torpedoes on Harrison to take him out. For this special mission, The Enterprise also takes on another science officer, the Admiral's daughter Dr. Carol Marcus (winningly played by the sexy Alice Eve), who is a weapons specialist in charge of maintaining and surveying the torpedoes. Long-time Trekkies know exactly who Carol Marcus is destined to be as she and Kirk have instant chemistry! With some goading by Spock, a bloodthirsty and vengeful Kirk opts to spare Harrison and bring him back to face trial for his murderous actions. While prisoner on board the Enterprise, Harrison reveals a couple of major secrets to Kirk: that Admiral Marcus has ulterior motives and of Harrison's true identity, both of which set the stage for an exciting second half! Although this sequel has it's share of exciting action, courtesy of maverick J.J. Abrams, much like the first film, it is all accentuated by deeper, richer characterization and interactions between the principals, especially Pine and Cumberbatch, who play well off each other. While Cumberbatch plays the primary bad guy with relish, Weller makes for a great secondary villain. Younger audiences might not know this, but Weller actually used to play mostly villainous roles in the early 80s in his pre-Robocop days! There are also several wonderful scenes between Pine and Quinto, foreshadowing the complicated and legendary Kirk-Spock friendship from TOS.And although the characterization is key, the film really boasts some eye-popping special effects and several exciting action sequences, including the thrilling underwater sequence that jumpstarts the film, an invigorating space-jump sequence at past the halfway point, and both a dizzying gravity-defying sequence and a pulse-pounding mano-y-mano fight in the climax. Even more so than the first film, this superior sequel makes me yearn for even more Trek!",Star Trek Into Darkness
121,PartialMovieViewer,This Does Need Another Installment,10,30 May 2013,"Phasers on stun! What? NO WAY – this is James T. Kirk – of – the – starship – Enterprise. Place phasers on rip-the-bad-guys-into-atoms, shoot all the stupid photon torpedoes and call me when it is all over! Gotta love the Kirk mantra, 'Shoot first, take their women, and then ask questions.' Chris Prine has, 'James Thaddeus', down so well I would shudder being the 'Red Shirt' on any landing party. Of course, if you happen to be Spock – you will always be safe – and live long and prosper. Speaking of Spock, Zachary Quinto does a fine job impersonating Leonard Nimoy. He is definitely the 'logical' choice for any movies to follow. In all truth (my opinion) I think the entire cast did a very good job at making this an entertaining 'Star Trek.' I know – I know there are some people who do not like how things were directed, or something was out of place, or Scotty just didn't sound Scottish enough – I am not really a 'Trekky' – so I will respect those who saw something out of place. I thought it was well done and worth more than a lot of other flicks at the theaters. I mean, I remember the first - 'Star Trek: The Motion Picture', pardon me for a major sin – but that stank in a galactic way. IT was a very painful movie to sit through. And it was so bad I honestly thought that was the end of the 'voyage' and the crew was 'boldly' kaput for good. Thank the nebula for the second movie. It may not have been the best flick but it definitely rescue the 'Star Trek Saga' from the dilithium trash heap. In my opinion - and this is just an opinion – this movie was a lot of fun and a fine addition. My opinion may not mean anything to someI am only a lowly movie go'er – not a physicianbut for those who are not into peeling away too much of a movie, I think you will really have a blast. Well I must beam the heck out of here.",Star Trek Into Darkness

123,jon.h.ochiai,Greatness Emerges from Into Darkness,10,8 June 2013,"On the shuttle-craft journey to stop the powerful enigmatic John Harrison (menacing charismatic Benedict Cumberbatch), Zachary Quinto's Spock tells his love Uhura (Zoe Saldana) that he chooses not to feel, paradoxically the humane choice. Later in the heart wrenching story arc Chris Pine's Captain Kirk asks Spock, "" How do you choose not to feel?"" Director J.J. Abrams's reinvention of the Star Trek mythology in ""Star Trek Into Darkness"" is awesome. ""Star Trek Into Darkness"" is not just a great Star Trek movie. It is a great movie. Action packed, thought provoking, funny, and unexpectedly touching. Writers Roberto Orci, Alex Kurtzman, and Damon Lindelof are beholding to the saga, twisting the narrative, and boldly going where no one has gone before. Theirs is a Star Trek that is familiar and genesis of a new generation of fans. Michael Giacchino's score is heroic and stellar.Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto are amazing as Kirk and Spock, becoming their own. Pine and Quinto are never caricature, generate from, and are reverent homage. Distinct under Abrams's direction their partnership is punctuated by respect and love-- the leverage point of this provocative context of terrorism and the cost of ""the no win scenario"". This story of terrorism is more poignant than ""Iron Man 3"", and set in the 23rd Century. Qunito is awesome as Spock. He captures Spock defining himself: ironically funny, heroic, torn between his Human emotions and Vulcan logic. And we get to see Spock kick some ass! Pine is amazing. He balances the bravado and self doubt as Kirk, and not nearly so cock sure. In a great scene Kirk says to his crew, ""I'm sorry."" Karl Urban is rock solid and amazing as Bones, Dr. McCoy—the emotional conscience. Kirk asks Bones: What would Spock do? He says, ""He'd let you die."" As my friend Ron reminds: the best Star Trek stories were morality plays. Morality plays have great villains. The powerful villain is rogue Star Fleet Officer, John Harrison played by Cumberbatch. The enigmatic Harrison is ruthless, brilliant, and possessing inhuman strength. In spectacular scene on the Klingon home world Harrison effortlessly dispatches Klingon warriors with martial arts and weapon skills. Cumberbatch is a mesmerizing threat; his Harrison is driven by vengeance, and hides a secret. He asks Kirk ""Is there anything you would not do to save your family?"" Grounded after violating Star Fleet Prime Directive on the primitive planet Nibiru to save his friend Spock, in the stunning visual opening, Kirk (Pine) is discharged from his command of the Enterprise and charged under his mentor Admiral Christopher Pike (courageous and wise Bruce Greenwood). Star Fleet Headquarters was a target of a terrorist bombing. Kirk uncovers Harrison's involvement, and discerns that his motives are not what they seem. After a bloody courageous fire fight Kirk suffers personal tragedy. Now he too, is driven by revenge. Enter maverick Admiral Marcus (hard-nosed Peter Weller), who reinstates Kirk on a mission to kill Harrison. Marcus's daughter Carol Marcus (spirited and beautiful Alice Eve) covertly enrolls in the mission. That name is pivotal for fans.Let the wild ride commence. Visceral physical conflict and dramatic images of the Enterprise in battle thrill. However, it is the war of wills of Kirk, Spock, and Harrison that awe. The rest of the crew has their shining moments, particularly Saldana and John Cho as Sulu. Spock questions the ends justify the means paradigm adopted by benevolent Star Fleet. Later Kirk tells Spock, ""I have no idea what I'm supposed to do! I only know what I can do!"" In Abrams's morality play all is not what it seems. Villains can be heroic. Vengeance consumes. True heroes inspire. I can't wait for the continuing voyages of the Enterprise. May they continue to boldly go where no one has gone before.",Star Trek Into Darkness
124,khanbaliq2,Into Darkness is polished pop cinema that's also one of this summer's best releases.,8,20 July 2013,"Star Trek Into Darkness is an exciting science fiction action film, with more emphasis on action than on science fiction. It's a sequel that's on par with Star Trek (2009). Trekkers may again be disappointed with director J. J. Abrams' work because he replaced much of the intelligence of the old Star Trek with humor, spectacle and, dare I say it, violence. But what else can one expect from summer blockbusters these days? It's a sign of the times, and if you want to know why it is so I recommend reading books by American historian Carroll Quigley. The well-chosen cast remain intact and provide more of that humor and interplay that people liked so much in the previous film. They do a good job. With the direction of Abrams they all deliver good performances. Chris Pine was likable before but he only got better here. I think that Zachary Quinto doesn't play Spock as well as Pine plays James T. Kirk. Quinto is fine in the role, but if you compare his performance to that of Leonard Nimoy it's clear that he's lacking. Anton Yelchin as Pavel Chekov was one of the standouts in the previous film. It was always interesting to see him on screen. Here he's as good as ever but he was given less screen time than before. And it's not just Chekov. It seems that all the secondary characters have less dialogue this time around. More time is spent on the action. Compared to the old Star Trek films this is a difference. But the character relationships are still there. Much of the humor is provided by Karl Urban as Dr. Leonard ""Bones"" McCoy and Simon Pegg as Montgomery ""Scotty"" Scott. The 2009 film lacked the presence of a strong villain. This time writers Roberto Orci, Alex Kurtzman and Damon Lindelof make up for that with an antagonist who's a real challenge for the entire Enterprise crew. Benedict Cumberbatch deserves the praise that he has received. He's determined. He's cunning. He's ruthless. He's sympathetic when he needs to be. The alternate time line that was established allows for some neat changes to the events in the old Star Trek films. The biggest draw, however, is the eye-popping action and the exciting, slick set pieces. These are aided by Dan Mindel's appealing cinematography and Michael Giacchino's bombastic, rousing score. In conclusion, Into Darkness is a bright futuristic adventure. Considering it's high entertainment value it's no surprise that it has become a commercial success. I recommend it.",Star Trek Into Darkness
125,carbuff,Just like the country song goes (at least how I remember it): You just can't find an editor when you need one most.,6,11 May 2015,"So you know where I'm coming from, I'm not a trekkie and I'm not a fanboy. I like sci-fi, but am not crazy about comic books or movies based on them. I grew up on the original Star Trek, but never really watched or cared for the newer versions or spin-offs. My biggest criticism of this film is that while the special effects were pretty spectacular, it seems like Abrams was so enamored with his ability to do cool visual things, that he just couldn't stop making the movie. I would have rated this film much higher if they would have edited out 25-30 minutes, but as it is, it doesn't have the script to merit its length. Also, especially towards the end, the blatant disregard for basic laws of physics and increasingly ridiculous acts of physical ability became so absurd that it was nearly impossible to ""suspend disbelief.""Furthermore, it was a bit grating that all of the aliens in the movie essentially looked like human beings with very serious disfiguring diseases. How come alien life forms from all over the galaxy have bilateral symmetry with two arms, two legs, a single head and neck on their shoulders, two eyes, etc? Certainly it couldn't have been the special effects budget that spawned such biologically impoverished extraterrestrials. Most of all though, this movie suffers from a major case of bloat. I really liked the film through the first half, but kept stopping it in the last half just to see how much was left--I couldn't believe it when I stopped it near the end there was still 21 minutes to go. At that point, I'd had enough and just wanted it to end. Don't they have editors in Hollywood?",Star Trek Into Darkness

Because they all went on to star in a legendary TV show which ran for 3 years and 6 spin-off films. Yep, this is the second prequel flick to the original Star Trek, and it's just as much of a white knuckle ride as part one, with some unexpectedly moving scenes thrown into the bargain, too. All the cast really DO look like younger versions of their older counterparts, and it's their camaraderie which provides many of the best moments. There are those amazing special effects too... But meh, you could have guessed that.I do have a number of small bugbears though... for a start, the climax never seems to end. Forget about pausing for breath, it throw around 5 crisis at us in a row, and by the end of it all you'll probably feel physically drained. And how is it that this superhuman nemesis they're after is able to take out an entire squadron of Klingon warriors almost on his lonesome in hand-to-hand combat, but can't even dispatch Mr Spock in a fistfight towards the end? I'm sure there's a perfectly logical explanation for this. Perhaps Spock could give it to me himself. 7/10",Star Trek Into Darkness

I can't say I'm a huge fan of sci-fi films in general or the Star Trek franchise in particular. I did watch the original Star Trek TV series when I was young and enjoyed it. Never been overly impressed with any of the Star Trek related movies. Having said all of that I have to confess that I was pleasantly surprised with Star Trek into Darkness and enjoyed the movie.I suspect the main reason I enjoyed the film is that it has a very similar tongue in cheek feel that the original Star Trek series had. The plot isn't the greatest, but it ticks all the right boxes. Zachary Quinto as Spock is particularly good and Simon Pegg as Scotty was also going to work out well.

129,swilliky,"Action-packed, cool villain",8,19 July 2016,"The rebooted alternate timeline of Gene Roddenberry's creation continues with the sequel Into Darkness. After the initial film established the main crew of the Starship Enterprise, the second one picks up with Captain James T. Kirk (Chris Pine) in a dire situation with Bones (Karl Urban) as they run from an alien species with a sacred scroll. The tension of the opening scene only rises as we find Spock (Zachary Quinto) and Uhura (Zoe Saldana) in the middle of a volcano.The whole crew returns with Sulu (John Cho), Scotty (Simon Pegg), and Chekov (Anton Yelchin). Even Pike (Bruce Greenwood) returns as an Admiral now, still scolding Kirk for his brash attitude towards intergalactic relationships. A new terrorist rises as John Harrington that is quickly revealed to be the iconic Khan (Benedict Cumberbatch). I was not aware of this character before but found out upon a little research that this casting was another white actor cast into a role previously portrayed by an Indian actor, so that is disappointing. But Khan is portrayed as powerful and evil and it is hard to deny Cumberbatch's acting talent.The special effects looked great as J. J. Abrams returns to director bringing plenty of lens flare in outer space. The action takes the crew out into Klingon space, which is the first appearance of this dangerous aliens in the new universe.

At times it was like watching someone play a video game.It was a really well made waste of time. No insight into the human condition, no thinking necessary, just eye candy and forgettable events.And that's a shame, cos there was some great acting going on here. all the cast delivered well especially Cumberbatch and Quinto, some great looking effects, but why bother?

The important thing was really ""human nature"" the rest was an environment needed for the development.In this case, the best parts are the legendary discussions and smart one liners between Jim Kirk (Pines), Spock (Quinto) and McCoy; with the added bonus of a really funny Scotty (Pegg) and a strong and smart Uhura (Zaldana). This two last characters never got fully developed on the original series.The action and spectacular scenes are very well made, but seeing them in 3D was too much for my eyes (advice see this movie in 2D ).The bad guy has been another well made decision. Cumberbatch has probably more screen time than any other character; and he uses it very well. Even when you know what he will be no good; is able to look trust able.The only real problem (aside from the 3D strain) is the plot. Everything is too predictable and there are a few holes that could have been easily avoided; but Abrams never seemed to care too much about that.In brief; excellent acting and dialogs; spectacular action scenes and a so so story makes this a perfect way to expend two relaxing hours.",Star Trek Into Darkness

When I heard the film name, I've immediately got out from the bed and sat in front of the TV right away and watched it because at that time, I planned to watch it, but never had a chance. That's why I was so eager to see it. Unfortunately, at that time, the film was nearly ended, so, I could only watch the final scene. Lucky for me is that they aired it again at night. So, I watched it. Later, because I love it very much, I tried to get it and yeah, I still have it in my PC.

133,bryank-04844,'Star Trek into Darkness' has tons of twist and turns and is on the highest level of entertainment.,8,23 August 2015,"I must admit that when I walked into the crowded theater to watch J.J. Abrams' second journey into the 'Star Trek' universe, I was a bit apprehensive. The studio didn't hold any press screenings before the film was released on Wednesday. For some reason, the actual press screening was one hour later than the regular screening for paying audiences. Usually, studios do this when they know they have a terrible movie on their hands and don't want negative reviews published before opening day. Would that be the case here, or did Abrams simply want to keep the film's many secrets under wraps until it was released?I'll avoid specific spoilers in this review, and will try to talk more or less in generalities. First and foremost, know that I loved 'Star Trek into Darkness'. Abrams has conjured an action-packed thrill ride of a sequel with just enough heart to appease new fans of the franchise as well as old school Trekkies. I have no doubt that this will be one of the most successful films of the year, and won't be surprised if Paramount announces a third entry in the next few weeks.'Star Trek into Darkness' still takes place in Abrams' alternate 'Trek' timeline, established in his first film, but he continues to link the two continuities here as well. One of the things I love most about this sequel is that it's a story about how Kirk and Spock's friendship evolves. In this reboot of the franchise, we haven't seen Spock and Kirk become the friends that we know they'll be. Kirk is still young, cocky and brave, while Spock struggles with his half-Vulcan and half-human sides. These two Starfleet officers do not mix.Things start out with Kirk, McCoy and Spock on a primitive alien planet as a very large volcano is about to annihilate the entire landscape and its inhabitants. With this intense situation, Kirk does what he does best, by acting rogue and unwilling to follow the rules. Spock, of course, uses logic rather than emotion to accomplish the same task. From this, we see what their relationship is and what it could be. Later, Kirk is relieved of his Captain rank due to his insubordination, and is replaced by Commander Pike, who demotes him to First Officer.Meanwhile, a huge terrorist explosion destroys a bunch of buildings and kills a lot of people on Earth. At a Starfleet meeting led by Admiral Marcus (Peter ""RoboCop"" Weller), we learn that a man named John Harrison (Benedict Cumberbatch) is behind the bombing and has escaped to a far off, supposedly uninhabitable Klingon planet. The Enterprise is sent to capture him. However, there's much more to this story and Harrison than meets the eye.Abrams focuses more directly on the duo of Kirk and Spock this time around. While we have some good moments with other characters, they don't have much screen time and mostly serve for comic relief, which is done flawlessly and works in great references to the original films and TV show. And if you thought that the previous movie had a ton of action sequences and spectacular visual effects, you're in for a treat with this sequel, which turns the action up to Eleven.Cumberbatch really shines here. You never know quite what to think about him, but he's truly a force to be reckoned with. Even though he's roughly the same size as everyone else in the film, he appears larger-than-life and is very terrifying. Quinto and Pine turn in stellar performances as well. This is maybe some of their best work to date, as we see both men struggle with their flaws and their friendship. I believe that the true core of this sequel is almost a love story, but one between two friends who are destined to do great things.Simon Pegg as Scotty has his own separate mission and is a key part of the movie. The humor he brings is much-needed and always welcome. Karl Urban never fails to impress as McCoy, the doctor who's always angry at something. It's amazing to see him flirt with some of the staff on the ship. Anton Yelchin's Checkov doesn't get a lot of screen time, but has a great scene involving his uniform. I believe Sulu (John Cho) will have a bigger role in upcoming films. In his brief time on screen, he demonstrates that he's capable of leading a starship. Zoe Saldana as Uhura serves as more of a comic relief role this time around. And of course Peter Weller puts his all on the table and is ruthless to a tee.I saw the movie in IMAX 3D. If you have the option to see this in IMAX, by all means do so. I truly felt like I was on the bridge of the Enterprise for the whole film. The sound was incredible. The 3D, however, is take-it-or-leave it. I didn't find it to be good or bad, just average. I would have much preferred to see the film in 2D.I can't wait until we have 'Star Trek' films where the Enterprise does what it's meant to do, which is go out into the beyond and explore new planets and life forms – to boldly go where no one has gone before. This isn't that movie, but I expect that the next one will be. 'Star Trek into Darkness' has tons of twist and turns and is on the highest level of entertainment. This is a remarkable sequel and I can't wait to see it again. This might be the most fun I'll have at the theater all year.",Star Trek Into Darkness

They are incredibly good, full of excellent VE, actors are always good, action is almost non stop. What else can you ask from a Star Trek movie? And especially if they go to the Klingon home world. Why? Well, 1992 when we had census in the former Yugoslavia I found Klingons so sexy when they asked me for my nationality (a very important question in that census) I answered that I am a Klingon and my native language is Klingonese. From the moment I watched the original Star Trek series to the newest films I always enjoyed all of that world which Rodenbery invented. What an imagination and brain! The saying: Beam me up Scotty! is a legendary one. We use it whenever something out of ordinary happens, something we cannot comprehend, and we have to admit there are a lot of those moments this rotating Earth gives to us. Didn*t you want to be beamed up if you were a New Yorker during 9/11? Or in any of those incredibly crazy moments we can not comprehend.Which part of the film I like the most?

135,jdkraus,"You can't go wrong in seeing ""Star Trek Into Darkness.""",10,9 June 2013,"J.J. Abrams's first Star Trek picture managed to take the familiar characters that die hard fans have relished for decades and bring them back to life with greatness, as well as present a new twist in the Star Trek universe. With ""Star Trek Into Darkness,"" can Abrams and his team of writers make a sequel that is as good, perhaps even better than its predecessor? The answer is yes. This success is not necessarily just from the reappearance of all the characters from the previous film. Nor is it even from the photo-realistic visual effects and action sequences. Rather, it is revealed from its clever story and one of the best Star Trek villains ever brought back to the big screen...Kahn. The film picks up a year after the events from the prequel. Kirk has botched a mission and is demoted from his position as captain. When a series of events follow suit, including mass destruction and a death of a close friend, Kirk is put back in the captain's chair and sent on a mission to capture Kahn, the man responsible. But like with all J.J. Abram films and TV shows, there is more to it than you would ever anticipate. What is so good about this Stark Trek, is that it is quite unpredictable. Characters die sudden and unexpectedly. The story makes twist and turns, elements that are enough to put me on the edge of my seat at times. There is never a dull moment in this film. What is also so good is the amount of references tied in from other Stark Trek films. Not trying to give much away, but there is a scene re-adapted more or less from ""Wrath of Kahn."" It is a beautiful and poignant scene that many past Star Trek fans will find amusing and touching. English actor Benedict Cumberbatch takes the mantle as Kahn. For those of you who remember Ricardo Montalban in Wrath of Kahn, an old man with bad make up and a fake chest and biceps, well, Kahn is not like this anymore. His intelligence and strength are strong enough to make him more than a formidable enemy for Kirk and the Starship Enterprise's crew. His performance, loaded with blank facial expressions and lifeless eyes almost remind me of a young Anthony Hopkins playing Hannibal Lector. It would be interesting to see the two play a game of chess.J.J. Abrams has out done himself again with his new installment of his Star Trek series. It is blockbuster success in terms of fun, entertainment, action, humor, story, and above all a great villain. You can't go wrong in seeing ""Star Trek Into Darkness.""",Star Trek Into Darkness
136,Prichards12345,Star Trek The Rip Off Of Khan,5,1 January 2014,"Entertaining? Yes, certainly. Brainless popcorn fodder? Yep. Anything to do with the philosophy of the classic Trek? You got to be kidding.Like it's reboot predecessor Into Darkness is basically just another loud, cgi-infested Hollywood action movie. These films are becoming very generic indeed. In both The Avengers and Skyfall the master villain gives himself up to further his master plan, and yep, that's exactly what Khan does here. The writers, including Damon Lindeloff - he who helped to turn Prometheus into a total travesty - steal countless stuff from the earlier franchise movies. It's not original to substitute Kirk for Spock in the radiation chamber. Nor is it original to pinch from the Star Wars prequel trilogy, either.Into Darkness is like about 90% of Hollywood summer blockbusters these days - aimed at 11 year-olds, with minimal story logic, little character development, and headache-inducing editing in case someone gets bored in row 35 of the multiplex. I avoided this till blue ray - the only Star Trek film I've ever missed at the cinema. I knew from the original reboot what to expect, so felt I'd better appreciate it at home.Don't get me wrong; this is not a terrible film, far from it. It's fun and often exciting. So is shooting aliens in Space Invaders. At least for a while. What about character? It's hard to care about Spock, McCoy and Kirk after only two films with these actors. When Nimoy died in Wrath of Khan it was shattering. When Pine dies here it has no emotional impact because at the end of the day it's just an enjoyable forgettable action movie. Still, compared to Lindeloff's script for Prometheus it's like 2001 in comparison. At least he and the other writers have stolen effectively here.If you don't know anything about Trek as it was in the past you can add 2 stars to this review. If you do just be like me, enjoy it for what it is, and don't treat it as canon.",Star Trek Into Darkness
137,Carycomic,I just got back from seeing this.,5,17 May 2013,"It was a lot better than the previous movie (hereafter referred to as STAR TREK: THE NEEDLESS REBOOT). But, that being said, there is still way too much room for improvement. For one thing; the Klingons have been revamped yet again! From guys with bluish-gray skin and curly hair, to burly guys with bumpy foreheads and hippie-length hair, we now go to guys who look like rip-offs (oops! I mean, ""pastiches"") of Lou Gossett Junior's character from ENEMY MINE.If that's going back too far for those of you under 25, then imagine the space-lizards from V. Only with lobster-red skin.The only reason I give this five stars is the cameo by Leonard Nimoy, as the older (a.k.a. one true) Spock from the alternate 24th century. That; plus the admittedly poignant death scene that serves as a surprisingly legitimate homage to the similar scene in WRATH OF KHAN.In short; this sequel is alright. But, it's still got more than a few yawn-worthy scenes. Which is a few too many for my peace of mind.",Star Trek Into Darkness
138,jessegehrig,Ripping off Wrath Of Khan is not the same thing as actually writing,4,21 May 2014,"Not good but not total crap. Here is the debate: You can have Star Trek with more action but a stupider plot or you can have Star Trek that's boring but is in no way stupid. J.J. Abrams chose action over plot, the result is a Star Trek that is fast moving and action packed, but its also a Star Trek that is stupid. Star Trek has always been that guy at the party who is a little boring to talk to but knows what he is talking about, and now J.J Abrams has giving Star Trek a big boost of charisma but at such a high price, sacrificed wit. If you are not a Trek fan or a mild Trek fan you will have no problem with J.J. Abrams style Trek, if on the other hand you like that Star Trek always has to be a bit boring so as to tell a smarter story, then welcome to the new suck.",Star Trek Into Darkness
139,ersinkdotcom,'Star Trek Into Darkness' keeps frenzied pace of first movie; adds social commentary creator Rodenberry insisted on,9,20 May 2013,"Remember that excited feeling you had when seeing ""The Empire Strikes Back"" for the first time ever? How about that stunned feeling you felt when Darth Vader tells Luke Skywalker he's his father? That's the sort of feelings I walked away with after watching ""Star Trek Into Darkness."" I'm so happy I avoided all spoilers for it. I walked into the movie blindly and was so thrilled I couldn't stop smiling through the entire thing. After a terrorist attack on the Federation council, James T. Kirk sets out with the crew of the Enterprise in search of the man. The terrorist, John Harrison, has fled into Klingon territory. Kirk is ordered to take him out through the use of a torpedo. Kirk disobeys orders and travels into Klingon space to capture the terrorist and bring him back to Earth where he will stand trial for his crimes. However, a rogue Starfleet officer wants to take justice into his own hands and only Kirk and the Enterprise stand in his way.I've read a few of the reviews floating around out there and must say I agree with some of them. ""Into Darkness"" is a true ""Star Trek"" film. While the 2009 film was full of action and humor, it didn't have the social commentary Trekkies came to expect from earlier entries. That's not the case with ""Into Darkness."" What we get here is the best of both worlds. The action aspect of ""Star Wars"" is still present, but it's coupled with the smarts ""Star Trek"" is known for.There are so many fun little tributes to the original series in ""Star Trek Into Darkness."" What's crazy is none of them feel desperately forced into the story. Writers Roberto Orci, Alex Kurtzman, and Damon Lindelof peppered the homages throughout an already exciting storyline, which helped long-time ""Trek"" lovers find something familiar to latch on to. At the same time, the references wouldn't leave someone new to the franchise wondering what's happening.My only real complaint with ""Star Trek Into Darkness"" is the handling of the McCoy character. Writers took a funny habit the good doctor had in the original TV series and drove it into the ground. Every time we see McCoy, he uses some sort of metaphor to describe the situation. It starts to feel like the stale joke your buddy tells every time you see him. After the first ten times, it's just not funny anymore. How many different plays on, ""Dammit, Jim! I'm a doctor not a speed boat captain!"" can you laugh at before it gets old?I was impressed with the CGI and special effects in the film. The movie looks beautiful and the actors meld seamlessly with their artificial backgrounds. There are times where the Enterprise looks a bit animated, but it's nothing to complain about.""Star Trek Into Darkness"" is the movie die-hard Trekkies wanted to see in 2009. All the elements creator Gene Rodenberry wanted the show to have are present. However, it comes wrapped in a package that will appeal to a broader audience.",Star Trek Into Darkness
140,Likes_Ninjas90,The Enterprise is starting to travel in circles,6,8 May 2013,"In 1966 Gene Roddenberry created Star Trek as a TV series and coincidentally this was the same year that director J.J. Abrams was born. The show was pitched as a space Western in the vein of Wagon Train, which was a Western mystery show set on the Frontier. Star Trek converged with the start of the Vietnam War. Roddenberry had already seen action as a fighter pilot in World War II. To counter Vietnam, his version of Earth was a society without conflict and in space there were galactic truces, race relations and a sense of unity aboard the ship the Enterprise. As with any good Western, there was moral code of ethics between men, no matter how pointy their ears might have been. Roddenberry believed in a disciplined society that could be unaffected by war or religion. Spock for example was said to be modelled on a police Chief he knew when he was part of the LAPD.After many years as a TV show and dozens of films, someone decided Star Trek should be reinvented yet again and Abrams was hired to transform it into a glossy action film. As a filmmaker J.J. Abrams is somewhat of an enigma. One of his heroes growing up was Steven Spielberg. When he was a boy he was hired to repair some old film footage for him. Spielberg would later produce Abrams most personal film Super 8, a movie that typifies the director's career. Part of the film is a loving tribute to home movies and geek culture, while the other is a bombastic, overblown blockbuster, short of any personal imprint. He's a slick filmmaker, I enjoyed his TV show Alias until it became ridiculous, but he struggles to find the balance his idol has between action and character. Into Darkness is a better film than the messy 2009 film though. The best scenes overcome the generic, simplification of the action genre by retreating back towards the essence of the original show: a morally ambiguous grey zone, where the values of the characters and their races are tested. However, the characters are still bound by a rigid story structure, where at least ten elaborate set pieces take full precedence over the human and Vulcan drama. The most interesting aspects of the plot are when Spock (Zachary Quinto) and Kirk (Chris Pine) butt heads over their different beliefs. Kirk is tasked with tracking down a rogue agent named John Harrison (Benedict Cumberbatch), who is now essentially a terrorist bomber, causing havoc in London by using desperate people to do his bidding. This leaves a chilling, lasting impression, particularly when the film adds a layer of complexity, with Spock insisting that Harrison should be captured and trialled first. He's at odds with the order of the mission and Kirk, who wants revenge for the death of a colleague. Cumberbatch is frighteningly good in the film, a massive improvement over Eric Bana's villain in the first movie. The tension he brings through his menace, his arrogance but also his ability to cast doubts in the minds of the protagonists about who the baddies really are, is a magnetic quality that is hard to prepare for prior to seeing the film. What a terrific find he's become over the last few years. However, by ingraining itself in the structure of an action film, a lot of this ambiguity is undone. Whereas action and moral ethics fought and overlapped persistently in The Dark Knight, Into Darkness' rhythm is too discrete and foreseeable. The action is timed acutely to follow a stretch of exposition, dividing itself between moments of ideology and combat, and the emphasis on set pieces means the lines between good and evil become transparent again and remove the crucial shades of grey. Abrams also seems more interested in choreographing lavish action sequences than exploring the personal side of the drama. His imagination in the set pieces is limitless. He employs an array of frenzied techniques, including rapid cutting, tilting cameras, overhead shots and quick pans, to breeze through the action. Yet when the characters stop to face one another and talk his direction has none of the same flair or creativity. The actors sit or stand still, with the camera perched on their shoulders for dull reverse angle shots that don't heighten the tension. Rarely do we ever see these characters in their downtime either. Without any inner life they become ciphers for voicing conflicting moral ideas, like instinct against logic or law and these conflicts are often resolved within a scene of one another. After watching Star Trek II: Wrath of Khan recently, which Into Darkness borrow from, it's also fascinating that Kirk is viewed as an ageing man who has to start thinking about death and his legacy. In this film he's more on par with Tony Stark, able to bed two alien girls with tails at once. That amplifies where they're aiming this film at, in spite of the occasionally intriguing layering of the story. For a franchise that prides itself on going where no man has gone before, the Enterprise is starting to travel in circles.",Star Trek Into Darkness
141,Christian_Dimartino,The first one was wonderful. The sequel is a near miracle.,10,27 May 2013,"When J.J. Abrams's last Star Trek movie came out, everyone was excited but me. I was not a Trekkie, I didn't want to be a Trekkie. I thought it was for freaks. Then I saw it, and I understood. The film was a wonderful introduction to the characters, and it made stars out of Chis Pine, Zachary Quinto, Zoe Saldana, and the rest of the unknowns in the cast. I loved the movie, it made a Trekkie out of me. I eagerly awaited a sequel. Four years have passed now, and it has finally arrived. Now only does it arrive, it soars.Where the first one wonderfully introduced us to these characters, Star Trek Into Darkness goes deeper into them. We grew to love them the last time, but now we feel as if we actually know them. The actors, in particular, Pine and Quinto, have sunken into these roles, and that is a good thing. They are perfect at them.The film takes place sometime after its predecessor. Captain James T. Kirk (Pine) is now the captain of the starship Enterprise. Spock (Quinto) and Kirk are friends. Spock and Uhura (Saldana) are a couple, but she doesn't exactly like how Spock feels nothing towards everything, which is sort of a re-occurring topic throughout the film. But the foundation of the Enterprise gets shaken with the arrival of a mysterious terrorist (played superbly by Benedict Cumberbatch). Kirk and the Enterprise set off to find him and hunt him down. But if you have any idea who this guy is, it isn't going to be easy.The special effects are a knockout. The cast is terrific. Cumberbatch plays one of the more fascinating villains in recent movies. I love the friendship between Spock and Kirk. There isn't a boring second in the entire film, and the last half hour is powerful. Into Darkness accomplishes just what the previous film did, but it takes it a step further. They take the characters that have already been developed, and it digs deeper. I have always been fascinated by Spock's character, and it was nice to see the writer's go further.Star Trek Into Darkness is the best movie of the summer so far. It is a smart, occasionally funny, visually arresting, and over-satisfying sequel that will either leave some Trekkie's irritated or dying and going to heaven. The reason why I say that is because it may or may not tamper with the Star Trek storyline. There is an obvious reference to another Star Trek movie in there, and only Trekkie's will catch it. They will either love the reference, or loathe it. I personally loved it. But that said, nothing can really sway me from this movie.Abrams has done a fantastic job with these films, and I can't wait to see him take a stab at the next Star Wars movie. But my question is this: Will he make a third part? God I hope so. He has proved himself to be a terrific filmmaker. He is the heart and soul of them, and the fate of the series truly rests in his hands. If not, then we still have this film to remember him by. If this his last journey with the Enterprise, it was a great one.A",Star Trek Into Darkness

143,timdalton007,Looking To The Past While Boldly Going Forward,7,21 June 2013,"Following on the successful reboot of Star Trek in 2009, the question was where the series would go next. After four years of waiting the answer has finally arrived with Star Trek Into Darkness. So how does this new film stand up? The film's cast is strong, especially with its supporting cast. If 2009's film established the new versions of Kirk, Spock, McCoy etc. than this is the film that cements them. Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto in particular are given the chance to go further in their roles of Kirk and Spock and their sometimes fractious friendship. Most of the main Enterprise crew is put to go use as well including Zoe Saldana as Uhura and Simon Pegg's Scotty who is given a much welcomed larger role in this film. There's a strong supporting cast including Bruce Greenwood's welcome return as Admiral Pike, Peter Weller as Admiral Marcus and Alice Eve as Carol as well as those in smaller roles such as Noel Clarke who has a small but pivotal role early in the film. The real star of the film though isn't any of them.That would be Benedict Cumberbatch as the film's villain. With him the film brings us the most fleshed out Trek villain we've had in some time which, given who it turns out to be, might not come as a surprise. What is a surprise is that Cumberbatch brings to this villain something that villains of any type are so often lacking of: unpredictability. Cumberbatch is anything but predictable in his choices as he goes from what the publicity has called ""a one man weapon of mass destruction"" to the point of even managing to get the audience's sympathy at one point. While the film as a whole works, it shines at its brightest when Cumberbatch is on screen.Though it doesn't have the galaxy hopping locations of its immediate predecessor, Into Darkness is blessed with some strong production values. The mainly earthbound locations of 23rd century London and San Francisco are well realized with their mix of iconic locations of the past and modern day with more futuristic architecture. The film also gives us our first glimpse of the alternate universe Klingons, who are used sparingly, and their homeworld of Kronos. The film is also dependent upon CGI for much of its special effects and the film has its share of impressive moments involving the Enterprise in all its glory that really need to be seen on the big screen to be truly appreciated. While it may lack some of the scale of the preceding film, it is nevertheless an impressive piece of work from a visual stand point.Then there's the script. Star Trek in the past has proved that it can be at its best when focusing on its characters and by reflecting our present day world into its futuristic setting and Into Darkness does both. As mentioned earlier, the film develops the friendship between Kirk and Spock along with the friendships and relationships between them and the other crew members of the Enterprise. Like Star Trek VI reflected upon the end of the Cold War, Into Darkness reflects the post-9/11 world into Star Trek's 23rd century setting, something which there has been some talk about elsewhere. As part of the background that makes the films plot, it works quite well though I can't help but wonder if the point of it has been lost on some (Does the film's villain secretly being used to help in a Cold War style situation against the Klingons before turning against his former ally and giving its militaristic elements the context for a war sound familiar to anyone?). If you notice that it adds an extra layer to the film but if you don't notice it then it is just part of plot and you can enjoy it anyways.The film also continues the trend set by its predecessor of making use of already existing elements from the Trek universe. They range from possibly obscure references to characters (some perhaps more obvious than others) and plot points. Just how successful they are will likely depend upon how much you know of Trek going into the film, especially when it comes to the films last act which is either an incredibly good homage or a downright shameful rip off of one of Trek's best endings. Which of those it is I can't quite decide myself but I do think that this film perhaps over relies on it and, combined with something quite predictable, does undermine the film somewhat. Yet the mixing of old with new works for the most part, as it did in the last film, and shows that the filmmakers are looking to what came before as much as they are looking to the future.For some of its flaws, Star Trek Into Darkness' successful continuation of the franchise has proved that 2009's film wasn't a fluke either creatively or financially. While the alternate timeline still has its detractors for some of the changes it has brought about, the film works because of its mix of old with new as it looks to the past while still boldly going forward. As a result, there can be no doubt that the franchise will continue on for the foreseeable future. The only question is, to quote a line from the film itself, ""Where should we go?""",Star Trek Into Darkness
144,roedyg,not a real Star Trek Movie,5,28 October 2014,"This is the most disappointing Star Trek film I have seen.The first problem is it is a prequel with all new actors, none of whom look like or sound like or even act like the originals. The ship is inexplicably now ten times larger and more complex. The warp drive and transporter technology are different than they should be. The bridge looks like it were designed by Klaus Lagerfeld, completely unrecognisable as the Spartan original. It takes getting used to the new characters and completely different sets. Someone seeing is as their first Star Trek movie would not have these difficulties.The next problem is this not really a Star Trek film. In a normal Star Trek film, you encounter some alien civilisation with odd customs and get to explore the ramifications of that difference. Instead, this film is about warring egos with fist fights and gun fights to settle the matter. Boring!There is no subtlety, other than trying to figure out whom it is safe to trust. You spend an extreme percentage of the film watching CGI of things blowing up. Boring!There is just the briefest, but intriguing scene where Captain Kirk seduces two ladies who have slithering tiger tails.Star Trek is not known for its plausibility. There is a lovely bit of dialogue poking fun at that characteristic when Kirk gets a dressing down. However, it strained my credulity past the breaking point when they would show the ship with huge gaping holes blasted into it, then show inside shots of people screaming ""we lost all power"", then showing everyone running about with full lighting having no problems breathing.An annoying goof: Everyone screams ""the gravity system has failed"". Instead of floating about, everyone starts either sliding or falling.People do various leaps that would be implausible even in a video game.The villains Khan and Marcus keep us guessing what their motives are and whether they are telling the truth. This is pretty sophisticated stuff for the movies.Kirk goes into the core of a reactor and kicks it to get it going, almost killing himself with radiation in the process. This is just too stupid for words.Did I say that most of the film is just a series of explosions and ray gun fights? boring boring boring.",Star Trek Into Darkness
145,sashank_kini-1,"Into Darkness Is Brightened Up In Impressive 3-D. But Its Plot Conventions Are Predictable, Which Weakens The Surprises and Makes The Film Ultimately A Disappointment.",5,13 May 2013,"The problem with science fiction/superhero movies is that the moment you understand the schema of its plot, the surprises hardly matter to you. So it wasn't hard for me to predict how the story ultimately led to the triumph of good versus evil; revealing the moment I'm referring to would be a plot spoiler but what I can say is that Into Darkness almost gets rid off one of its lead characters. I stress the word 'almost' here because we all know that a mainstream blockbuster film can never take a risk like this and make itself too 'depressing'. So then comes a turning point, taken from an earlier scene that's hardly explored during the film to come as the vital, life-saving moment. Heroes can't die right, because if they do they won't be cool anymore, right? Wrong.I really wish films like Star Trek Into Darkness do away with trickery, a mockery of the reality of life, death and mortality. It's like having a funeral for one's grandmother where the funeral rites are performed only for the grandmother to jump out of coffin and scream ""I was playing with ya'll!"" – what about all the tears that were shed in losing her? Into Darkness could've taken the chance, but it doesn't and gets formulaic like most other superhero films. The movie begins impressively, getting straight to action with starship enterprise captain James T Kirk and Lieutenant Commander Bones escaping Planet Nibiru, a distant planet inhabited by a primitive tribe and on verge of a volcanic eruption. Kirk's commander Spock risks his life to rescue them and enters the volcanic mountain, but Kirk and Bones reach the Enterprise safely before Spock can rescue them.The volcano ruthlessly rises up and Spock finds himself trapped and the only way for Enterprise to save him is to expose the starship to the primitive tribes. Here is where, as those like me who've watched the exciting prequel know, attitudes clash as Spock's stubborn insistence to obey the principle directive thereby sacrificing himself in the fire goes against Kirk's heady impulsiveness to flout directives whenever necessary thereby to expose the starship and save Spock. We know who wins here and we also know who faces the consequences; Kirk is demoted to First Officer by Admiral Pike after Spock, who can't lie, notifies Enterprise's rule-breaking much to Kirk's dismay – he calls Spock 'pointy' in the scene where they're summoned for an explanation (Spock has pointy ears). Later we see a devastated couple whose daughter is in comatose and has little chances of survival, until Starfleet agent John Harrison promises the girl's father a cure for his child. In return, however, he instructs him to blow up Section 31 installation in London, which the desperate man obliges to. After Pike gets killed in another attack, this time a direct assault on Starfleet officers, Kirk urges Fleet Admiral Marcus to reappoint him as Enterprise's Captain to find Harrison, who hides in Kronos, an enemy territory ruled by Klingons, and take him down. Admiral Marcus approves his request, and dispatches seventy-two torpedoes for this purpose. Much later do we find that Harrison isn't exactly whom everyone expected him to be, and there's a deeper and far sinister secret withheld by Admiral Marcus, carefully stored in the seventy-two torpedoes he supplied the Enterprise.I saw a similarity between the themes of Into Darkness and another blockbuster, Iron Man 3. Both the films deal with danger of excess of power, Into Darkness having John Harrison and Iron Man 3 having Aldrich Killian as the super-strong nemesis. And I sensed while watching both these average films that they inherently criticized America's (and the world's) untrammeled technological advancements, especially those which could potentially threaten human existence. Even these observations did not make Star Trek Into Darkness a fully satisfying watch, because what I'm seeing are the usual science fiction conventions albeit presented in 3-D with highly elaborate special effects. What also put me off was that we could hardly see the action from the villain's point of view, his plans, schemes and tactics, and only could get watch the heroes continuously defending themselves against the attacks. Remember how in the Harry Potter series we could alternatively watch the action from Harry's and Voldemort's sides – hardly do we get that battle here. And it doesn't help either that Chris Pine can't emote worth a damn during any of the intense moments in this film. In the end, what you get is a great 3-D experience and a chance to catch Benedict Cumberbatch doing his version of Angelina Jolie's Salt. What you also get to see sadly is a mediocre film that's being unnecessarily hyped without reason.More on sashankkini.wordpress.com/",Star Trek Into Darkness
146,griffolyon12,A Spoiler-Free Review of an Awesome Movie,9,16 May 2013,"I am going to do something different than I normally do when I review a movie. I am not going to give any specifics as to the plot of the movie, for this is a movie best experienced as spoiler free as possible.Director J.J. Abrams' follow-up to his 2009 Star Trek reboot, Star Trek Into Darkness, is Abrams and company's equivalent of The Empire Strikes Back, or The Wrath of Khan, as you will. Like the two aforementioned films, Star Trek Into Darkness is not without wit, charm, and humor, but by the very nature of the life-and-death stakes of the story, it is far darker than its predecessor, but also more emotionally rewarding.This film has Bad Robot's DNA all over it. J.J. Abrams' production outfit, Bad Robot, has produced a film that is as full of twists and breakneck turns as their TV shows. Suffice to say, if you are a fan of Bad Robot productions, in particular Lost, Fringe, and the first Star Trek from four years ago, then you will be right at home here and will love everything about this film. This is a sequel that maintains the character relationships that made the first film work so well, and deepens them even further in this film, to where you are actively engaged in the fates of each and every character.While I would say the first film had more energy and bigger Summer thrills, this film has more character and more emotion, making the two impossible to compare. It's like trying to compare the original Star Wars to The Empire Strikes Back. They're two completely separate types of films, both are adventure films, but one is more lighthearted and one is the most moving Star Trek film I have ever seen.Actor Chris Pine delivers a hero's performance as Captain James T. Kirk that is every bit as charming and soulful as Harrison Ford in Raiders of the Lost Ark. Then there's Zachary Quinto as Spock, who continues to make you ask, ""Leonard Nimoy-who?"" I actually believe that I am liking this crew of the Enterprise more and more than any other incarnation of Star Trek. I don't think there has ever been this good of chemistry between the actors as there is in this series of Star Trek films, and it shows in every single frame of this film.

It's got space battles, weird alien species, trials and tribulations, strife between the crew of the ship... everything you'd want in a Star Trek movie. But it's also got several plot-holes throughout the film which could have been avoided. I'm rating it a 7, instead of a 8.5 due to the plot-holes.",Star Trek Into Darkness
148,Imdbidia,"Utterly entertaining action movie, but an odd Star Trek",7,23 January 2017,"The last Start Trek movie I watched was about 15 years ago or so, so I watched this one as a stand-alone movie, without knowing what the previous new generation Star Trek films were about or the story was coming from. Well, surprise surprise, the movie was utterly entertaining and engaging. It was so enjoyable that I didn't even check my phone once.Overall, the story is a deviation from what Star Trek used to be, more a galactic battle than an exploratory trip. The philosophical exploration is almost absent from this film, nothing that makes me ponder, wonder or reflect. And the little thing there, is nothing new, original or worth noting. I didn't mind it because I truly enjoy action Sci-Fi films, and this is a good example of the genre. I liked that there is some sort of exploration of Mr Spok's character, his motives and inner life.It was great to see a few familiar faces that I always love to see on the screen: 'Robocop' Weller, 'Hot-Fuzz' Pegg, 'Sherlock' Cumberbatch, and all-round-actor Greenwood. Pegg is hilarious as Scotty, and adds the humour and wit that the movie needs. Cumberbatch is perhaps the best of the lot, as the ice-cold intriguing Khan. Zachary Quinto is also good as the robotic not so robotic Mr Spok, and the rest of the cast are all right in their respective roles. There is a great cameo that you don't want to miss if you are a hardcore Star Trek fan.The production is great regarding interior design, city landscaping, robotics and special effects. Very sleek overall. However, it failed to me in two fronts: the dressing of some of the Enterprise crew, who seemed to be wearing active-wear more than any futuristic clothing. The second, some of the alien characters looked pathetic, like humans wearing rubber masks not real aliens.There a few things that really annoy me in Science Fiction, because if they are there, I don't think the director, producers or writers are taking the viewers seriously. Science-fiction is fiction, for sure, but there are things that cannot change because, basically, that is impossible, those are the laws of Nature and of the Universe. One of those things is going to a planet called Kronos, which is not in our Galaxy, with a different atmosphere and environment to Planet Earth, and see the characters going out of the spaceship breathing normally. The other is thinking that a person who is exposed, unprotected, to humongous levels of radiation would come alive or could be revived using whatever.If you don't take the story too seriously, this is a terrific action film with an entertaining story, great wit and visually spectacular.",Star Trek Into Darkness
149,Laakbaar,"Enjoyable and with great special effects, but too hectic and lacking in character development and the original Star Trek spirit",7,19 May 2013,"This is a fast-paced, action-filled Star Trek movie roughly based on the Kahn story. Special effects are a big part of this movie, and they are truly spectacular.The second great thing about this movie is that the TOS characters have been brought back to life as their younger selves. All of the actors (including Pine) have done a marvelous job with this.I enjoyed the first half of this movie more than the second half. The film more or less fell apart for me when the villain was introduced. I was surprised and dismayed that Abrams had decided to revive Khan, which in my view has been done to death. Also, I didn't really like this particular villain. (He reminded me a little of the ridiculous Bane character in The Dark Knight Rises.) The story line involving this character was too far-fetched and complicated.Also, I still have a hard time accepting Pine's Kirk. This is an interesting Kirk, but it is a Kirk who has no gravitas, no military bearing, no judgment, no leadership. He commands zero respect. He could not command a rowboat, never mind a star ship. And yet we're expected to believe that Star Fleet (not to mention his highly trained crew) would allow him to do all these things. Sorry, it's just not believable. In TOS, one of the issues was that Kirk was constantly beaming away from his ship rather than sending other people to do the exploring. Abrams and his writers ignore this problem. As discussed extensively for decades by Star Trek fans, a captain should be with this ship. This Kirk is never with his ship. He seems to have no relationship with his ship at all. He gives the impression of not being an explorer at all. I think a mistake has been made in not developing the characters more fully. The three-way dynamic between this new Kirk, this new Spock and and this new McCoy should be given time to develop. In TOS, the various characters developed slowly, and were revealed to the television-viewing audience, as the episodes progressed.Another issue is that the quirks of each character were, well, just quirks. Kirk's bad-boy side, Spock's internal struggle with his emotional side, Spock's annoying reliance on logic and regulations, Bones's orneriness and contrariness, Scotty's overprotectiveness of the ship – well, these aspects were not what these characters were all about. Abrams and his writers have turned these quirks into personalities. It's like their personalities have been warped out of shape by these quirks. It's not realistic, and somehow disrespectful of the original show. You can't have a captain who is always a bad boy, an engineer that quits whenever his ship is threatened, a ship bay's doctor who argues and complains about every single damn thing.The same applies to the relationship issues between Spock and Kirk, between Spock and Bones, and so on. These relationships are merely side issues in the lives of these space explorers. It's overdone in the movie. Besides, these characters are too young to have grown into these relationships.For the love of Pete, Spock is supposed to be a Vulcan. Stop obsessing about his emotional side. Let the new Spock develop his character as a proper Vulcan. Right now I don't know what to make of him. He hardly seems Vulcan at all.I recognized and appreciated the various references in the movie to the TOS episodes. However, some of them were annoyingly not consistent with the Star Trek universe. Also, it is generally dissatisfying to see earlier episodes and movies redone. I hope Abrams abandons that approach. I want to see new, original ideas. I do not particularly want to see TOS incidents and episodes rehashed. The minute I knew this was a Khan remake, I knew he would either end up in stasis again or be deported to an isolated world with the other supermen. If Abrams wishes to make Star Trek relevant to a new generation, he should do it without hollowing out old TOS plots.It bothered me that Abrams dragged Nimoy back into this. I actually groaned aloud when he appeared. Is new Spock now going to contact old Spock every time he gets into a pickle? Finally, this movie was too hectic. Star Trek is not primarily about action, space hardware, chases and shootouts. Nor is Star Trek about special effects. Star Trek is thought-provoking, idea-based science fiction set in a future when want, war and money have been eliminated and the Federation is exploring the galaxy. Star Trek does not have to be about conflict and action. I hope Abrams and his team can see that. I'm not really into action movies, and I'm certainly not into shootout and chase movies. It would be a shame for the franchise to go in this direction.There were a number of other things in the movie that didn't work for me, but it seems petty to list them in detail.Sure, I enjoyed it well enough, but it did not blow me away and it left me with a bad feeling about where this is going. They may be destroying the spirit of the franchise to make money from a generation of viewers. The sad part is that these moviegoers will think that this is what Star Trek is all about. I know it will be hard to ignite the imaginations of a modern, jaded, cynical, internet-and-video-game-addicted audience. There are already many action and superhero movies out there. Star Trek should go in a different direction.",Star Trek Into Darkness
150,billygoat1071,A Nostalgic Ride,8,16 May 2013,"At first glance, Star Trek Into Darkness looks like it's going to follow a recent trend that highlights its villain who is plotting an ultimate destruction and serve some deep and compelling villainy speeches. Though, Star Trek already did that with The Wrath of Khan and it seems like they are doing it again but with the tone of a modern pretentious blockbuster. Surprisingly, it's a promotional trick and we instead get the same magic of its predecessor. Star Trek Into Darkness is as exciting as the last film. It also takes a lot of references to one of the series' classics which manifests nostalgia. But for some reason, it troubles finding enough innovations for the ones who've already seen that movie. Despite of that, it's still one of the most enjoyable blockbuster you'll see this year.The 2009 film wasn't as smart as a Star Trek film would ask, but the real reason why it's so good is it has the heart of bringing everything back to life while using blockbuster elements. Noticeably, non-fans(or yet to be fans) of the series enjoyed it even more, mostly because it is more focused on the mainstream storytelling than science. It's easy to forgive that since it's just a re-introduction of its universe. Now in this sequel, they are trying to be actually Star Trek. The plot is basically like The Wrath of Khan but with bigger thrills and less Genesis. The film adds some clever ideas to the plot, but the result is barely innovating. Even though it's fun to point out the references, the film seems to be better when it shows something new.The overall experience is nostalgic to both versions of Star Trek. Other than the references, it never abandons its own tone. The journey is full of life and the characters possess genuine soul. The performances are slightly the same from the last film. Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto however made the friendship between Kirk and Spock much compelling than before. Karl Urban provides more humanity to his Bones. Simon Pegg seems to mimic James Doohan this time but he still manages to play his own Scotty in some parts. As expected, Benedict Cumberbatch delivers his lines in an utterly terrifying way, makes his little dimensioned character a nerve shattering villain.J.J. Abrams made it a total cinematic ride. The entire journey is perfectly big, letting the audience feel the thrill throughout the experience. In an era of over CG-ed blockbusters, this is probably the rare one that has the most impressive looking special effects. The CGI looks convincing enough in many details, even if you're seeing it in high definition. The action aims more to the fun. Unlike most blockbusters, this one lets the momentum and the camera do the best work while the effects are nothing more than just a background.If Star Trek Into Darkness is not that fresh then it's nostalgic for recapturing the best moments of the 1982 film, but we still get to see some new ideas. The introduction of the film kind of summed it up, the very first sequence takes place in an intriguing Mayan-esque planet while Spock mentions one of his remarkable dialogues. If you can't be bothered by the similarities then it's a pure entertainment with real suspense. There is no denying how electrifying this sequel is. The scale looks grander than any recent ""big"" movie. It's amazing in craft and fortitude, and the characters are still a joy to watch. It's generally not perfect. There are potentials that didn't live up that much, but if you can get over it then it's absorbingly fun.",Star Trek Into Darkness
151,dilipbts,Star trek into darkness,9,30 June 2020,"As someone who has grown up with the franchise, watched every show and every movie (I've watched the entire DS9 series at least twice!), suffered through characters/actors who I didn't care for (Tasha Yar, seriously?), I realize we all have opinions about what makes Gene Roddenberry's vision so lasting.That being said? I LOVED this movie. I even capitalized it I loved it so much. The play between the characters, the more human version of Spock, the absolutely delightful ""Scotty"" (although his sidekick is one of those throwaway characters I dislike) as well as a much better crafted plot this time made for a completely enjoyable movie. The action is intense, the friendship deepened between the characters, the twists and turns are a bit predictable at times, but that is reminiscent of the franchise as a whole. I am already excited for the next movie. I tremendously respected and appreciated the ties in this movie to the elements that make Star Trek great - strong story line, deep connection to the characters and a philosophical element. In some of the older Star Trek episodes the moral/philosophical element can be oppressively heavy handed. No so in the new Trek movie. The ideas of friendship, family and humanity are woven through this movie with subtly and I will outright admit I more than teared up during the climactic scene in the engine room. EVEN though I had already figured out what was going to happen, I have already come to care about, respect and enjoy the new actors in their iconic roles.So yes, ten out of ten. And let the haters, hate. Those who can not embrace change can go sit and watch old Star Trek reruns and bemoan the 'good old days' and spout off all the reasons why 'Star Trek ain't what it used to be'!!!!I, on the other hand, will boldly go and embrace the new with a continued reverence for the old.

And I see a lot of movies.",10,21 May 2013,"Rating: 4.9/5 Reviewed by Dare Devil Kid (DDK)The Star Trek franchise is truly revitalized, alive, well, and kicking thanks to J.J. Abrams. Not just is it the best Trek film ever, but its also a sci-fi classic, right up there with the best in the genre. J.J. Abrams might not be the next Steven Spielberg....yet....but he surely has the potential to get there. Just look at his already sterling repertoire - 'MI: 3"", the ""Star Trek"" reboot, and now its sequel. I am now feeling a bit relieved about the ""Star Wars"" sequels being hemmed by him.This movie checks a lot of boxes below that are required to classify a film of this magnitude as an instant classic:Great performances by the entire cast (especially Chris Pine, Benedict Cumberbatch, and Simon Pegg). - CheckThe quintessential amalgamation of CGI, action, plot, drama, suspense, thrill, and emotions in a sci-fi movie. - CheckGreat suspense, intrigue, and mystery in the plot to keep the audience guessing and hooked till the very end. - CheckA tight screenplay with good one-liners and some shocking twists that leave you more stunned than dazed - CheckAn awe-inspiring background score (but to be fair the score was already composed for the equally brilliant first film) - CheckEdge of the seat scenes and clap your hands moments - CheckStunning cinematography and production design - CheckMeticulously detailed makeup, costumes, and hair styling - CheckEqually enjoyable by avid, hardcore fans of the franchise and rookie viewers as well (read Trekkies and non-Trekkies) - CheckA sinking feeling when you know the journey through this great film is about to end and an absolutely overwhelming feeling exiting the theater - Check, Check, Check!Films like ""Star Trek Into Darkness"" is the reason why we buy movie tickets.

So, the only thing settings this movie apart from Star Trek (2009) is the ambitious performance of Benedict Cumberbatch as Kahn.Otherwise, the atmosphere is joyful and laced with action sequences in the vein of the predecessor.

156,TheSquiss,"Fun, enjoyable and colourful but missing something integral.",6,14 May 2013,"The Star Trek universe didn't really excite me. I enjoyed the original series reruns as a boy and watched several of the films before deciding The Wrath of Khan was probably as good as it was going to get and that I couldn't deal with watching the wrinklies staggering across the screen in roll-neck jumpers any more. Then along came 2009's Star Trek with a Batman Begins jumpstart.It was a moment (well, 127 minutes) of eye-opening reassessment. J.J. Abrams had cleverly, spectacularly reinvented the franchise for the fanboys and the jaded alike, and the USS Enterprise was back in some fashion! So, naturally, expectations were very high for Star Trek Into Darkness. How could the wizard who conjured it back to life not succeed? Well No, it's not fair to go as far as to say Abrams has failed. He hasn't. Far from it. Star Trek Into Darkness is a fun film, has plenty of spectacular moments, countless visual feasts to consume and lots to enjoy, but it just doesn't touch his first effort. I departed feeling unsatisfied. It should have been so much more and it felt incomplete despite being rammed full of effects, action, dramaStar Trek Into Darkness is a new take on a familiar story with a villain (Benedict Cumberbatch – I'm not sure if there'll be cries of ""Plot spoiler!"" if I reveal his character) on a mission of destruction and revenge; roles are swapped, action ramped up, emotions toyed with and, rather than feeling tired, it gives a sense of comfort. We're with old friends here, both in terms of storyline and characters, but there's a danger of complacency and a real presence of flippancy. Far too often drama or tension gives way to a quip and the positioning of a tongue deeply in a cheek. I didn't buy 'funny', I bought spectacle, but too often the magnificence is diluted by frivolity.There are moments when it works, like the first couple of interactions with Scotty (Simon Pegg) and his pet, Keenser (Deep Roy who, strangely, isn't worthy of a credit on IMDb), but after a while it just becomes tiresome. That said, Pegg slips into the character more convincingly this time around; or maybe it's just that Abrams trusts him with more screen time.There's sufficient on screen to keep the fanboys happy with numerous references to the Star Trek canon, peripheral characters that mean little to most viewers and the obligatory nod to previous incarnations (both with actors and model spaceships lined up) and, visually at least, there are plenty of scenes of pure CG magic. The digital and physical sets are beautiful and the opening scenes, though a little too Indiana Jones to be taken seriously, are an exquisite blend of striking reds, bold yellows, stark whites and, finally, as the sea enters the frame, startling blue. It's a visually gorgeous sequence that feels a little tainted by cheap dialogue.There are periods where Star Trek Into Darkness feels confused. No, not confused, cluttered, as if too much has been stirred into the soup with no real idea of what the overriding flavor should be. We are given a two-hour game of musical chairs with the captain's seat in which every characteristic gets a shot at being in charge of something or just watches longingly from the sidelines: sexy Carol (Alice Eve), priggish Spock (Zachary Quinto), nervous Chekov (Anton Yelchin), grumpy Bones (Karl Urban), supercilious Uhura (Zoe Saldana), dependable Captain Pine (Bruce Greenwood) and, of course, rascally liability Kirk (Chris Pine). It's like watching a weird recasting of the seven dwarfs all vying for attention when they should be doing their jobs.Despite this being the second film in the reboot, Star Trek Into Darkness spends too much time introducing us to characters rather than allowing them to progress the story. We know who they are, so why does it need to be spelt out again so precisely? And why, oh why, does Abram still insist on Chekov mispronouncing his Vs as Ws? Yelchin is Russian, so surely he knows better. Admittedly, I don't have a lot of Russian names in my address book but I've not met one yet who actually drank wodka, other than in unimaginatively stereotypical movies.On a positive note, Cumberbatch makes a very dependable villain. He relishes the opportunity to exude power and menace and emerges the prominent star, or at least the most memorable performance, of the film. Strangely, though Kirk should be the hero of the piece, he is almost lost in the mayhem and his standout scenes are memorable largely for the presence of others: Carol removing most of her kit, Spock being stoically cantankerous or Pine just having the screen presence to swat Kirk aside.Not that it matters. Star Trek Into Darkness is fun. It's worth wasting a couple of hours over. It's just that it feels like the 'difficult second album' after a huge hit. Let's just hope Star Trek 3 is back on track.For more reviews from The Squiss, subscribe to my blog and like the Facebook page.",Star Trek Into Darkness
157,RevRonster,Pretty awesome...and that's coming from a guy who hates Star Trek,8,6 September 2013,"I'm not a Trekkie--I don't even have a curious interest in Star Trek. I just could never get into the characters or stories. I'm a Star Wars guy! I gave the reboot a shot and didn't care for it but this one had Benedict Cumberbatch playing the villain all Trekkies will tell you is the greatest bad guy in existence (and I'll be honest, I don't understand why) so I gave the film a shot and I loved it! The story is decent, the action is fist-pumpingly awesome and the special effects will make your eyes bleed rainbows because they are so stellar. The film did, however, have some issues. There's plot holes that will drive the pretentious viewer and Trek purist insane with anger and the cast of characters felt way too big for me as most of the characters end up being haphazardly placed in the story and feeling completely out of place like the writers quickly wrote scenes for them so they don't go to waste.However, the complaints are minor in my opinion as the film is fun to watch and just plain exciting thanks to its action and Benedict Cumberbatch making a villain I once held firm was all hype and his lameness being painfully obvious and watching him turn that character into something cold, calculating and cool.

We who are ready know these characters and know what they would do and did aren't supposed to pay money to see this ridiculous rendition of the classic, unforgettable Star Trek with Shatner, Nimoy and Kelley. And yet this movie dovetails itself into everything thing people like me know about the old show. They say that imitation is the greatest form of flattery well this movie imitates a lot but does flatter anyone. In fact there was so much imitation that there's no movie at all just an endless series of ""Oh we're going to die moments"" sandwiched in between bad dialog and dumb over the top acting.

159,cultfilmfreaksdotcom,Muscle With Brain,7,16 May 2013,"The Starship Federation often gets in the way of the intensely intrepid and equally stubborn James T. Kirk. He's the Captain of a Starship, sure, but as a risk taker he tends to land himself, and his crew, in loads of trouble. So now he's really in his element as the Enterprise winds up on a declassified mission that has nothing to do with Federation rules or having to stick by them.First we begin with another mission – one gone completely haywire. Thrust into a perilous situation, director J.J. Abrams lets us know this won't be anything short of a roller-coaster ride. Thankfully there are enough cerebral elements further along that... reminiscent of the original series that relied more on chess match precision than adventurous gusto brings us back into an old school aura including prosthetic aliens and various references to other characters from times past – or in this case, presentWhere Kirk, after putting the Prime Directive (to not interfere with the internal development of alien civilizations) in jeopardy... and following an act of domestic terrorism... the Enterprise ventures to a planet to find the culprit, a mysterious superhuman named Harrison, who did undercover work for the Federation – Marcus (Peter Weller) in particular, the man responsible for bringing Kirk's mentor, the endearingly lecturing Admiral Pike, into the Federation.The second half roars with unbridled energy: a resilient Enterprise shuttle lands on a planet replete with the usually combative Klingons. Yet these fallback foes mean little to our story: it's Harrison – who we eventually learn is the infamous warrior Khan – holding most of the cards... Within this constantly shuffled deck are twists and turns (while another important antagonist lurks in the shadows) that shouldn't be spoiled. And the way all secrets are revealed gel smoothly with the action sequences, each pivotal to the story and with little downtime in-between.While not entirely flawless... The awkward post-romantic banter between Spock and Uhura feels contrived; one particular scene is way too similar to a past TREK movie; and Kirk eventually becomes a brooding Marvel style superhero Thankfully the other crew members, especially Spock... tempted to follow his human emotions and Scotty, given his own subplot that ties loose ends together has important footing in this sequel to a reboot of a franchise that hasn't neglected its primal roots and doesn't completely adhere to a video game generation.

160,CinematicInceptions,"Okay, but very overrated.",6,19 August 2015,"I'll clear up the all important question of Star Trek knowledge now and confess that this is the only Star Trek anything I've ever absorbed. So I apologize if I get some facts heinously wrong or lack appreciation for this reboot. I do know that it has parallels to the old Wrath of Kahn, and I like the idea of Spock sacrificing himself at the end rather than Kirk, not because I'd rather have Spock die but because it involves true loss for Kirk. In this movie, he sacrifices himself, but gets lucky: Yet Again. Despite that, I thought the scene was well put together. If you are familiar with Christopher Paolini's Inheritance Cycle, but aren't familiar with ST, Jim Kirk is basically Roran with two times the luck and arrogance and half the leadership skills (I know that sounds biased, but I think it's accurate).If you love predicting how a movie will turn out as your watching it, you'll likely be disappointed here. There are some dramatic turns, but you can't really predict them because the turns don't draw on anything from prior information. The plot is of minor importance and involves a number of technicalities about tensions with the Klingons and stuff like that. After Kirk captures John Harrison/Kahn, it becomes very character driven. This is usually a plus, but I felt like it detracted because some characters motives didn't really fit with their personalities.The two main examples of this were Jim Kirk and Carol Marcus. Captain Kirk has a very headstrong personality (along with an arsenal of good luck charms it seems) and puts the safety of his crew as a top priority. However, many of the gambles he takes put his crew in serious danger, which is why I don't really buy that he cares about them. Carol Marcus has a different problem because she has very little personality but very strong views. So whenever she takes a stand of some kind, it comes out of nowhere. Kahn comes off pretty well and makes a good antagonistic force especially because he has a cause that is worthy of some degree of sympathy. Spock has next to no personality, as expected, but they somehow manage to give him depth. Dr. Bones serves as a secondary adviser to Kirk, but usually ends up getting shown up by Kirk's audacity. Uhura gets minimal screen time, and the majority of it involves her relationship with Spock. Scotty plays the typical Simon Pegg comic relief role, and ends up having some pertinence to the plot. Admiral Marcus becomes the main antagonist in his desire to wage war on the Klingons. His actions are a little ironic because they are really a microcosm to the whole premise of Star Trek. The main duty of the Enterprise and all of Starfleet is to be explorers, but they always seem to end up in a battle zone, and Admiral Marcus ends up providing exactly that. The rest of the characters consist of Pike and the minor Enterprise crew members, most notably Sulu.The spfx are very prominent in almost every second of the movie from the queer space creatures to the outer space settings to the high-tech environment of the Enterprise and Vengeance. The acting was pretty solid, something you wouldn't necessarily expect from an action flick. Benedict Cumberpatch had what I felt was the best performance as the cold and menacing Kahn. I wasn't too fond of the script, though. Most of it was incredibly generic for a sci-fi movie, where the lower-ranking people have that very official tone even when they're in an extremely dangerous situation. The lines that were supposed to be funny really killed it for me. They all came off as annoying, even the Simon Pegg material. And now that Interstellar has shown us that it is possible to have comic relief in a space setting without being annoying, I have only a little tolerance for it.It's possible to understand the movie without any prior knowledge, but I would recommend watching the trailer first. There aren't too many foreign terms like some sci-fi universes. If you can, watch it in a quiet environment. My final recommendation is to lower your expectations. The high ratings are kind of misleading. Not to say that it's poorly done, but there's nothing about it apart from the huge fanbase that should give it as high a rating as it has. Overall Rating: 7.2/10.",Star Trek Into Darkness
161,dfle3,Saturday matinée action movie 75+,8,28 May 2013,"A visceral follow up to the reboot of a few years back (it actually does seem too long a break for a franchise like this), this is an action packed movie well suited to gourmet popcorn. There is a plot...but only having walked out of the theatre just over two hours ago, I'm stuffed if I can coherently describe what the drama is all about. In other words, I suspect that Mr. Spock would have a field day with the logic of this movie. In any case, the crew of the U.S.S. Enterprise must travel to enemy territory in order to capture a human villain responsible for the destruction of a Starfleet building in London. Things do not go to plan, as the saying goes. No doubt the seeds of subsequent sequels are sown in this movie.As far as Star Trek movies go, this one is entertaining but I'm not sure how much repeat viewing it has due to its confusing narrative...or at least I don't think it would be repeated viewing in a small space of time. Of the original cast Star Trek movies, I most enjoyed the one about saving whales (whatever that one was called). I'm guessing this movie will also serve as the grounds for a reboot of a critically acclaimed original cast Star Trek movie. However, that one seemed to presuppose knowledge of the original cast TV series (which was before my time and I've yet to see)...and that won't be the case for the reboot...which is good.Any criticisms of this movie I have are minor...it's boy's own adventure material...absurd action scenes where you really could imagine Mr. Spock saying ""That's not safe!""...if he wasn't doing such derring do himself...which he does! For the reboot, I do remember Leonard Nimoy making an appearance in that...as he does in this sequel...which makes me wonder about the mechanics of his character's appearances and interaction with the rebooted crew. The villain of this movie also seems fancifully overpowered. And I worked out how an unfortunate outcome could be reversed before you got the visual clue. Lastly, Chris Pine's Captain Kirk seems a bit too young for mind, given his brashness and swagger. Be interesting to see if the sequel to this movie will be so long in coming out. The events of this movie make me wonder if consequences will follow for actions taken in this movie by the crew of the U.S.S. Enterprise.",Star Trek Into Darkness
162,Al_The_Strange,"""No ship should go down without her captain!""",9,17 May 2013,"In 2009, Star Trek was ""rebooted"", successfully remixing aspects of the classic Trek universe and making it all fresh, new, and exciting again. At the same time, it remained true to the classic characters and the spirit of the franchise. In the film's first sequel, Into Darkness sets forth to do the same thing most other sequels do: introduce more characters, raise the stakes, and take the audience on a (hopefully bigger and ""better"") thrill ride.This film definitely retains the thrill ride aspects; like its predecessor, it still has some great action scenes, some jaw-dropping special effects, and the occasional bits of humor (which has been toned down from the last film). The film does its best to present scenes that are bigger in scope and scale; the action setpieces are pretty massive. More importantly, however, it's the emotional scope and scale that's blown up: the film tries harder to tug at some heartstrings, and to make the characters count.Therein lies the film's most interesting and redeeming values: where the characters stand at this point. The first film introduced the Enterprise crew in a fresh new light, using Kirk's flirtation with death as a thematic pillar. In this film, the theme is expanded tremendously, pitting Kirk against death in a twisting series of events that constantly calls for him to make the hard choices. At multiple moments, everybody is called upon to question the value of human life, the value of the mission, and the morality of self-sacrifice. Oh yes, fans of the classic films will recognize these same aspects from The Wrath of Khan and The Search for Spock, because Into Darkness takes the same aspects and remixes them in interesting new ways. Some might call it a retread, but it does give the characters a strong emotional depth, and it helps to reinforce the themes of facing death.That being said, this Trek adventure does suffer a little from feeling like more of the same. Parts of it are predictable. Parts of it play it safe. Parts of it are clearly ripped straight from other Trek films (there are even some aspects that reminded me of Star Trek: Nemesis). Despite the plot twists and the emotional depth, the film still doesn't take any really bold moves. The ultimate climax felt really short and small in scale, and afterwards, the movie ends abruptly. In the end, I didn't feel that Into Darkness was any better or worse than the 2009 film; it's just more of the same. That's not to say it's bad, but I was hoping for more.In spite of that, the film continues to exhibit some jittery camera-work and plenty of lens flares, which will irk many viewers. Some of the camera movements are pretty brilliant though. Acting is the same as before: Chris Pine, Zachary Quinto, Zoe Saldana, Karl Urban, Anton Yelchin, John Cho, and Simon Pegg all inhabit their characters comfortably, and are a joy to watch. Bruce Greenwood is still good, Alice Eve is quite appealing, and I felt that Peter Weller's role is appropriate. The biggest draw to this film will be Benedict Cumberbatch as the villain; the man definitely establishes the proper screen presence and gives his character plenty of nuance. Writing for this film is pretty decent. As before, the film uses some clever camera trickery and unique settings to give the film a unique and authentic-looking edge. All the sets, props, costumes, and special effects are good. The music score offers much of the same as from the first film, but with unique new variations.4.5/5 (Entertainment: Very Good | Story: Very Good | Film: Very Good)",Star Trek Into Darkness

Like Syndrome said in ""The Incredibles"" when ""everyone is super, then no one is super."" The ""Team of Rivals"" logic falls apart, why then do you even need Kirk when Spock can negotiate with Khan and later beat the stuffing out of him on a futurist garbage truck? (So in the future garbage trucks fly but Kirk still uses an alarm clock to wake up between the alien women?). If Abraham doesn't stick enough to the logic, some of the actors stick too closely to the past especially Karl Urban who essentially does a comic's impression of DeForest Kelley. Simon Pegg flirts with the same problem with his ""Scotty"" but just narrowly avoids turning it into a caricature. Chris Pine does ""Kirk"" without Shatner's cheese factor but Jeremy Renner could have taken the character in a more interesting direction. Otherwise the actors make the characters their own particularly Zoe Saldana who brings a re-imagining to the originally flat Uhura character. For Abrahams, the Enterprise crew clock in as stock players in the service of his superstar Benedict Cumberbatch. JJ actually films his introductory scene with a standing applause break lingering on his excellent cheekbones to the point of communicability. From there the camera never really moves off him and he enjoys several bouts of evil super-villain monologue-ing as the rest of the cast looks on admiringly. Maybe re-reboot the franchise and make Kahn and his crew of augments the good guy next time? The plot remains familiar to fans and the action engages and entertains even when it makes little sense: the heavily damaged Enterprise loses engines and weapons but not artificial gravity, the Enterprise needs a huge crew of engineers but the ship one model more advanced can be full operated by one aging Star Fleet admiral, Kahn Rambo's an entire Klingon patrol with air support but...Anyway, enough decent action and writing exist to carry the popcorn adventure through its running time. In short, it may be where many man have gone before but might be worth another visit.",Star Trek Into Darkness
164,AvidClimber,Star Trek Into Darkness — Plunge further into its modern incarnation,8,30 May 2013,"Star Trek Into Darkness is the second adventure of the USS Enterprise since the reset of the series, and it follows its older Star Trek (review still to come) brother in style while accommodating the originals a little bit more.The good. Lots of very funny moments. Slick presentation and dialogs. Interesting scenario. Superb special effects. Nice work with the 3D. Excellent choice of cast making the crew pretty incredible.The actors. My favorites, in order of preference starting with my most favorite, are: Simon Pegg as Scotty, Anton Yelchin as Chekov, Zoe Saldana as Uhura, Zachary Quinto as Spock, Chris Pine as Kirk, John Cho as Sulu, and Karl Urban as Bones.The bad. The revival lost some of its originality by incorporating a lot more Star Trek lore into its core, but that's forgivable. 3D was totally unnecessary. The show I saw had some blurry scenes because the theater did a bad job with the 3D. 3D is still definitively a gimmick.The ugly. In a scene, a crew member asks dextrous help, yet end up easily yanking everything out: weak. At the end, they went for high drama, yet totally screwed it up afterward.The result. An excellent sci-fi movie with a lot to please the real trekkies. If you like the previous chapter, you'll like this one too.",Star Trek Into Darkness
165,artpf,It's OK,5,3 October 2013,"At the very start of the film there is the suggestion that Spock will die in a volcano. Only it creates zero drama cuz we all know this is the young Spock and if he dies there is no later series!Dumb script move.The script seems to lean on effects and not on characters.Characters is what made the original great.The movie is decent, but like the first, you wont want to see it twice and isn't that the measure of a great movie?So it falls way shortLong on style short on substance. That's fairly typical for Abrams.",Star Trek Into Darkness

167,diac228,A Good Ol' Fashioned Superior Blockbuster Sequel,8,17 May 2013,"In every good blockbuster sequel, the stakes have to be higher, the conflict must be bigger, and there must be an added depth of darkness. Ever since Empire Strikes Back, this has become the go-to formula for all big sequels: start big, and then aim higher. You walk with the original, you dash with the sequel. Star Trek Into Darkness does a superb job following this technique and delivers an extremely exhilarating thrill ride that ramps up on an intensity level I have never before witnessed with anything associated with Star Trek---especially, especially on the final act.Without spoiling too much (After all, with J.J. Abrams, you can never just give a synopsis to any of his work) the cast of the Enterprise get to experience a new threat that started from within the fleet and has practically begun to stage a war against the entire organization. Captain Kirk (Chris Pine) must face his greatest challenges while at the same time trying to maintain his stability as Captain. Alright, that's pretty much all I can give you: plus a couple new characters, a new villain (Benedict Cumberpatch) entering the mix of the rebooted franchise.With a writing team that has worked extensively with Abrams before (Lost, Fringe, Alias, Star Trek 09) this movie contains plenty of content, and plenty of grandiose themes about family and sacrifice. This summer movie isn't shallow, it makes you care for the characters, feel for the more sentimental moments, and root for the team to survive one of their seemingly dozens of close calls. While I really couldn't have cared less for one of the new characters (She might be blonde and might be the only one shown in a bra) the rest of the cast was back and fun to watch—especially Simon Pegg as Scotty.After it was announced that Star Wars 7 was being helmed by Abrams, I treated this as kind of an audition as to how far he has progressed since his Felicity days and if he's worthy of attempting Star Wars (I take that brand extremely seriously). Abrams definitely did not disappoint as he mixes heavy emotion with plenty of action, a slight pitch of comedy, and an abundance of twists and surprises. Lastly, there are so many nods to previous Star Trek movies that it nearly makes Into Darkness a bit predictable—which will be forgiven except by the thickest of true Trekkies.Star Trek Into Darkness will please fans, will please non-fans, will please newcomers, will please fans of special effects (Which were phenomenal), and ultimately will please those looking for the great blockbuster. This movie improves upon the original reboot in many facets and doesn't pull any punches. J.J. Abrams has taken Star Trek and has evolved it into more of a cult franchise, but one that is more inviting to newcomers and non-believers. Once the shock and thrills of the final act leaves the bloodstream, you will realize just how good a package Into Darkness truly is.",Star Trek Into Darkness
168,p-jonsson,"Better than I feared, actually quite good",8,18 October 2013,"I have to say that this movie was better than I feared it would be and that it was actually quite good. With the first movie I was not overly thrilled with the concept of the reboot and the alternate timeline. I still am not too thrilled about that even though I can understand the motivation for doing it since it certainly gives more creative freedom.One thing that sets this movie apart from the movies in the original timeline is that it is much more of an action movie. Many of the movies in the original timeline was downright slow. The little fighting they contained was over in a matter of minutes and they often went to extreme lengths to talk themselves out of everything. This one is much more of a roller-coaster ride and Captain Kirk is much more gung-ho and impulsive. To me this is a very positive thing and the main point that makes this movie a good one.There are of course other things making this movie worthwhile to watch. The special effects are quite enjoyable. Especially combined with the fast pace and plentiful action. I think Chris Pine as well as the other actors where performing quite well in their respective roles. I quite liked Benedict Cumberbatch as Khan although I have to say that I did not like the Khan element itself. It just felt cheap to try and ride on one of the most popular of the original movies. They could easily have made the plot, or at least a quite similar one, work without the bad guy being Khan.Another thing that disturbed me was that they just had to wreck the Enterpriseagain. Not only that but it really became ridiculous how much they could wreck on that ship and she would still hold together. In some of the original movies it went overboard in the other direction. One shot and weapons, shields, warp drive and everything else useful would go off-line. In this one they make Swiss cheese of her and she still flies. While we are at it, the scene where Kirk realigns the warp core by kicking at it is fairly ridiculous as well.In general I think this is an enjoyable movie. Maybe not 10 out of 10 but definitely high up on the scale. I hope they continue to make Star Trek movies with this amount of action in them. Certain reviews that I have read states that this movie is dumbing down Star Trek or ""Star Trek for morons"". I must say that I disagree totally. It is not any dumber than many of the previous movies and it has a fast pace and level of action that many of the others lacked.",Star Trek Into Darkness

I am no Star Trek fan, nor am I a Star Wars fan, and maybe that makes it a bit easier with this one. Because I really liked it. I liked the first one, and I liked this. It is just so well made and so entertaining. It's crisp, looks pretty, actors do a good job. You know, it's just a good movie.Eye candy all around, and lens flares up the wazoo! Which I don't mind, by the way.This was the first time I really noticed Mr. Cumberbatch too. I had heard his name, and probably seen him too, but I wasn't aware of him before this. He is pretty cool, I have to say. He looks super strange (that's just how he looks), and that really fits in this role.Star Trek Into Darkness has plenty of cool action scenes, the story works very well and pulled me in. Like I mentioned, I am initially no big fan of Star Trek, so this is very objective. Well, when it comes to the old Star Trek vs the new, vs Generations and all that stuff. I am not really especially a fan of Sci-fi in general, but I swallowed up this some'thin real good.Both the new Star Trek movies are entertaining fun, I think.",Star Trek Into Darkness
170,rooee,Superior sophomore star-hopping,7,9 May 2013,"J. J. Abrams' 2009 reboot was a blast of pure photon energy, replete with wicked flirty banter between Kirk (the rubber-faced Chris Pine) and Spock (Zachary Quinto), and some truly memorable action set-pieces. This time around, the snappy dialogue remains, the set-pieces are less memorable, and the plotting is heavier. Overall, it avoids the tricky second album syndrome - which, as Quantum of Solace showed us, can be most pronounced after a successful reboot. The plot this time around is suitably preposterous. After a galactic terrorist named John Harrison (Benedict Cumberbatch) attacks Starfleet, Kirk and crew are tasked with assassinating him at his hideout upon the Klingon home world. They end up capturing Harrison. A series of satisfying plot twists demand that Kirk and Harrison team up, even though Kirk knows he's aiding the enemy. Broadly the storyline is a means of humbling Kirk - as Commander Pike (Bruce Greenwood) observes, what Kirk really lacks is humility. I'll go straight to the film's main flaw, as I see it. Without wishing to risk spoilers, there seemed to be a point at which the film came to a definite conclusion. We know there will be a sequel (the plan is for a trilogy), so it would have been an interesting place to leave proceedings. But returning writers Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman, along with Damon Lindelof (Prometheus... *shivers*) apparently felt the need to wrap everything in a perfect bow again. A missed opportunity for a bold conclusion. But otherwise, the film is a riot, possessing the same screwball energy as the first film, and once again appealing to the sci-fi hardcore and the mainstream moviegoer without pandering unduly to either. As before, the scenes involving the Kirk-Spock love story are the best, their dynamic bristling with outspoken frustration and unspoken need. Simon Pegg's Scotty has a stronger role this time out, proving himself to be more than comic relief. Uhura (Zoe Saldana) is more of a damp rag, but thankfully there's powerful female support in the form of newcomer Carol (the anime-pretty Alice Eve). Star Trek Into Darkness is a worthy sequel to a film that somehow made Star Trek cool again overnight. In that regard, it may lack the same impact, but it has plenty of new ideas. If it's the filling of a three- part Abrams sandwich then it's very tasty indeed.",Star Trek Into Darkness

Star Trek Into Darkness gets better with each viewing from a non-Trekkie point of view. There are scientific theories (and therefore elongated explanations) to pacify one half and some kick-ass action for those too tired to think. It worked for Batman and Bond franchises and I have yet to tire from the focused Christopher Pine, Zachary Quinto, Zoe Saldana, Karl Urban and Simon Pegg . Quite the opposite!",Star Trek Into Darkness

Plus we have the addition of Admiral Marcus's daughter, Dr. Carol Marcus (Alice Eve), who manages to bluff her way onto the ship. Everyone did a great job, although I wasn't too sure about Scotty's accent, with Benedict Cumberbatch, Chris Pine, Zachary Quinto and Peter Weller taking top honours (for me anyway).Beautifully shot with much of the trademark lens flaring that is becoming synonymous with the films of J.J. Abrams. It really doesn't bother me as much as it seems to others. I'm really glad I saw it on the big screen (in 2D by the way) because it's one of those that definitely benefits from it. I can't imagine it having anything like the impact on a small screen. It's an epic plot that draws on elements from earlier iterations of these characters but totally turned on its head.

173,in1984,A Prequel back to the Original Space Fantasy,7,23 August 2013,"7.25 of 10. This is more of a Star Trek for the hardcore fans of the old series. Unfortunately, it holds on to some of the elements too much, not upgrading the science and technology. It's disappointing in that it doesn't boldly go to an entirely new crew, planets, and aliens. Fortunately, it feels like a 1-time step back to explore some of the unanswered mysteries of the story's origins. I'll be disappointed if it tries to become a series.It does boldly explore the pre-mission lives of the original Star Trek characters, giving them new dimension and a solid foundation. It makes you want to watch the old series from the start, but not a sequel.There are also some exceptional story and plot developments to make this unique and a good story in itself, villains that are much more complex than the simple alien adversaries of past stories. About the only place for this to go is a prequel of the prequel.",Star Trek Into Darkness

175,jackasstrange,"Flawed Masterpiece? Well, it's great for sure",9,23 November 2013,"I kinda like Star Trek: Into the Darkness. It's a complete film overall, because i mean, it's very entertaining, the story is indeed good, it has really very cool scenes, as a surprisingly almost touching dialog between Spocky and Kirk, near the end of the film, and also very beautiful shots of the space, however the special effects in the spaceships were not cool at all(a crime, if you consider the amount of money spent on the film just for that subject). The work on cinematography is good for sure, with some J.J Abrams frenetic 'single shot scenes' trademark in it. It has a few logic problems for sure, but nothing that really prejudiced the flow of the story. A quick example would be the fact that Kirk never listens to Spocky always right advices. This is really an idiotic and annoying fact, and if you not suspend your disbelief you really tend to not enter in the film at all. Apart from that, i really liked this film. It's so entertaining that the 130 minutes looked more as a half hour film. Some people have complaints about Khan being portrayed by a white dude(for those who don't knows, Khan is an Indian in the original Star Trek series). Well, i didn't mind for that little fact, 1) because i haven't watched the original Star Trek series, so i don't know if this 'race detail' is important for the build-up of the character or not. And 2), because i don't give a dawn about races 'truthful' portrayal in films or that kind of stuff. So, if you have an open mind and a bit suspension of disbelief, Star Trek may turn into a good film for you. Personally, recommended. 8.8/10",Star Trek Into Darkness

I'm not a big, huge fan of Star Trek but this was a fun ride. The crew of the Enterprise is hunting a notorious criminal. But who is the real enemy here? That will be revealed when and if you watch the film. As a reboot film, it worked for me, and the younger versions of the crew really worked, especially Zachary Quinto and Anton Yelchin (may he rest in peace!) as Spock and Chekov respectively. But if you're into deeper meanings like in the original shows, you may want to look elsewhere. This is just an action film in space. The special effects were good too.

177,renegadeviking-271-528568,It lives up the ideals and themes that fans expect from Star Trek,8,7 January 2020,"Star Trek Into Darkness has a lot to live up to. For some fans, it needs to redeem itself from a lackluster first movie. On the flip side, other fans don't see how this film could reach the same heights of Star Trek '09. Into Darkness is a thrill ride from the beginning that builds on the themes and characters from '09 and ramps them up to new levels, giving fans and the general movie audience something worth cheering for. Spoiler Warning.Manning Up:""Is there anything you would not do for your family?"" - John HarrisonThis movie is very much a Kirk story. In the first film, fans and general moviegoers alike scoffed at the idea that Cadet Kirk would be sitting in the captain's chair by the end of the film. Kurtzman and Orci took that criticism and turned it into a major theme in this film. Kirk may have been given the ""Big Chair"" for being a wunderkind, but in this film, he earns it.Kirk begins the movie brash as ever, buffeting the rules at his leisure. He cannot hear anyone elses advice or criticism of his decisions. Pike tells him that he is going to get everyone under his command killed because of his reckless disregard for the rules, and Starfleet actually takes the Enterprise away from Kirk.The theme of fatherhood comes up strong in this film, just as it did in Star Trek 2009. Pike is the only father figure that Kirk has left in his life, and he is everything that Kirk needs. Pike is a disciplinarian, yet at the same time lifts Kirk up. As Kirk deals with the loss of his command, Pike says, ""I believe in you. If anyone deserves a second chance, it's Jim Kirk.""gallery_06Throughout the film, Kirk learns what it means to be a man and a true leader. Kirk begins listening to his superiors and subordinates, and takes what they say to heart. He changes in light of the criticism he receives while discerning the wisest course of action at the same time, even if it does mean going against orders in the end. Kirk may still break the rules when he sees that as the best option, but his path to doing so changes drastically.Unlike Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan, it is Kirk who learns firsthand what it means to give his life for the needs of the many. This reversal works perfectly for Kirk's arc; he learns humility and fallibility the hard way, yet by the end, the change in Kirk is evident. He is not just a savant with an ego to match. He is tempered by fire and forged into the leader that Pike always knew he could be.War on Terrible Choices:The purpose is to experience fear. Fear in the face of certain death. To accept that fear, and maintain control of oneself and one's crew. This is a quality expected in every Starfleet captain. - SpockAnother major theme in the film is fear and how it drives our actions. Since the incursion of Nero in the first film, Starfleet has put itself on high alert. It even turned to Section 31, a rogue agency that acts in the interest of the Federation by protecting it at all costs. This film was dedicated to the memory of all those who gave their lives on 9/11 and in its aftermath. It is in that memory that sparks this question: How do we face fear of the unknown and respond to terror when it strikes at the heart of our cities, our countries and our very way of life?The film helps us look at ourselves through the lens of Admiral Marcus. His goal is to protect the Federation and its way of life, but at the cost of the very things he stands for: freedom and liberty. Benjamin Franklin said it best: ""Those who would give up essential liberty to purchase a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety."" Marcus' militarization of Starfleet along with his willingness to sacrifice the values of the Federation mirrors our world, leaving us with difficult questions. The movie shows us it is always better to do what is right even when it is difficult, even if it costs us our lives, it keeps us from becoming the very thing that we are fighting against.Family Ties:I am a great believer in found families and I'm not a great believer in blood. - Joss Whedongallery_19-1This movie is very much about family and finding it, even if it has been taken away. Kirk has no father and his surrogate is killed when John Harrison attacks a high level Starfleet meeting. Spock learns what it means to be a part of a family that is dominated by humans, as well as deal with the immense pain of losing his home planet in the first film. John Harrison fights to save his family, while Carol Marcus deals with the shame that comes from having a family member betray everything she thought he stood for.The crew of the Enterprise deals with severe growing pains in this film. One of the most interesting things is watching how each officer learns from one other, influencing and complementing each other's skills. Trust and faith in the gifts of each member of the family clearly shines through. At center stage of this are Spock and Kirk. Each of them leans on the other's strength, and doing so cements their friendship forever.Spock finally comes to terms with the immensity of his feelings for the loss of Vulcan. The loss is so great that it has wounded him to the core of his being. As a result, he has drawn even further inward, causing to him to repress his typhoon-like emotions, alienating his friends and his paramour Uhura even more in the process. Spock learns the valuable lesson that withdrawing from community and cutting off emotions will not help him heal; he must grieve and process the loss, just like anyone who has experienced an important loss, and doing so is better with a support system of friends.star-trek-into-darkness-2In our world, found families are becoming increasingly more important in place of the once-dominant nuclear family. Community is a key ingredient to the success of individuals, as the old song says, ""Lean on me, when you're not strong,"" and this is a message the film speaks loudly. We need each other to remind us of who we are at our best and help us find our way back when we lose perspective. In this film, the crew of the Enterprise becomes a family that is dedicated to a mission that transcends themselves, and it is one that lies at the very heart of Star Trek: to seek out new life and new civilizations for the betterment of all of humanity while being committed to its values and morality.Conclusion:""Space, the final frontier...."" - Captain KirkThis is a great brilliant Star Trek film. It lives up the ideals and themes that fans expect from Trek, while at the same time, takes the audience on a wild ride. Some fans may complain about using plot ideas from the original series, but they are used to full effect here. What results is a story that furthers the characters and challenges the viewers. Many will mistake this as a retelling, yet it is not. Kutrzman, Orci and Abrams have taken pieces from previous Trek and re-engineered them into a new tale that is both compelling and contemporary. Personally, I think that this is a better movie that the first. There is no burden of the ""origin story,"" allowing us to dive right into the narrative from scene one, which lends itself to much more character development in this JJ-verse. Into Darkness uses most of the characters well (Sulu may be the one with the least to do, but he does get a taste of the big chair), and gives them all shining moments, creating a sense of urgency as we eagerly anticipate the next voyage of the starship Enterprise.",Star Trek Into Darkness
178,troyputland,Into the Darkness We Go,9,10 April 2015,"J.J. Abrams takes this new brand of Star Trek to the next level. It reaches greater heights that XI could not, starting with a hard-edged villain in the shape of Benedict Cumberbatch. He's a largely physical presence, saying little and conveying power through a stare or his baritone voice. He's more than a match for Chris Pine's Captain Kirk and the crew of the Enterprise; after a devastating attack on earth, they spend most of their time one step behind him. The alternate reality/new time-line from the previous film has now branched off like a tributary, opening up possibilities for familiar characters with different stories. Into Darkness, rather than choosing to go further afield, stays close to home, looking no further than the Academy. Cumberbatch's space-terrorist is a member of the organisation, so trust is limited for Kirk and company. Pine, Quinto and the rest are as engaging as ever, but it's Cumberbatch that hogs the spotlight. The story is even more epic than the last, and the ending boldly goes where no man has gone before. This might be a slight exaggeration, but it's a significant improvement on the first (eleventh) film.",Star Trek Into Darkness

But after hearing some very favorable reviews I decided to rent the first one. I thought it was pretty good, but when I saw the trailers for Into Darkness, I thought ""This looks amazing! I should go see it."" I have to say, it was a lot better than I expected. I caught some of the references to Tribbles and the Wrath of Khan movie, which I hadn't seen but had heard the infamous ""KHAAAAAN!"" scream enough to get the reference in this film. (I've seen Wrath of Khan now, thanks to the miracle of Netflix.) Plus, one of my friends is a HUGE Trekkie, so I was able to follow the plot pretty well. This is one of J.J. Abrams's best films.

180,cosmic_quest,It gave me an adequate Trek fix!,7,8 May 2013,"I've been a Trek fan since the age of ten and it was the show that ultimately opened to door to the world of science fiction (and geekiness!) for me. So I do hold strong feelings for this franchise and that is why I swiver over my feelings for Abrams' films.The film opens with Kirk extensively breaking the Prime Directive and, while he does so with good intentions, he is portrayed to be much more devil-may-care and arrogant (perhaps, even adolescent) than Shatner's Kirk. But before he can suffer Starfleet's disciplinary action, Earth is attacked by a terrorist John Harrison. Determined to bring him to justice, Kirk and his crew set out after him only to discover nothing is what it seems.Benedict Camberbatch did a good job as the ruthless Harrison but, through no fault of his, the actual character portrayal within the story meant he never quite had the same complexity of the Joker or even Loki from the Marvel-verse. Not to ruin the film too much but I do think this is the result of this franchise being restricted to two films compared with the original films, which had a whole series to build upon. I can't complain about the Enterprise characters as I do think they all do their roles justice and are worthy successors (I can complain, however, that there just was not enough McCoy- give him more scenes in the next film!).In terms of the actual plot, it makes for a great popcorn flick that will appeal to general cinema goers who have no clue about Star Trek as well as being entertaining enough for Trek fans who do tolerate Abrams' films. As I said, it did lack some of the emotional appeal because the characters just do not have the history and level of deep friendship that we saw in the original films (and how can they when there is only meant to be a year between this film and the first one?). I also wish they would do more to recreate the Kirk/Spock/McCoy friendship that was such a part of the original series. McCoy barely has screen time here and I think that even despite being biased about my favourite character.In all, I do think it's worth a look. It's not fantastic nor does it compare to 'Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan' but it is an entertaining film that moves along well from what was established in the first film. I hope it doesn't take them as long as four years to produce a third film. One thing though, see it in 2D if possible. The 3D is pointless and a waste of money for those of us who have to fork out extra for 3D tickets. It's time Hollywood relegated 3D to kiddie films and cartoons.",Star Trek Into Darkness

I had hopes for Enterprise The First Explanatory mission with the Star from Quantum leap but the acting never sunk in...maybe I saw reruns of the original between 5-9 and that just stuck with me. In addition many of the original episodes had a Twilight Zone feeling feeling to it.
Granted I was 10 when I saw Wrath of Kahn, and though today I watch and laugh like a Roger Moore Bond film...with Ricardo's indisputable over dramatized Kahn....and the famous Shatner ""KAHN!!!!!!"" and the what was the end of a 20 year bromance with Spock's death. In this film I had no problem with a Kahn revival, Kahn's awakening, the paranoid Klingon hating Admiral it was flowing well. Even working and getting stabbed in the back by Kahn was done well.
Till that point I was ready to say this was better than the first...but then the Enterprise is dead...a sacrifice must be made...then a farcical tribute or mockery of Wrath of Kahn's Spock death scene turned me off completely not only because it didn't feel right (these aren't friends for decades, you knew Kirk wasn't dead...or would be resuscitated with Kahn Blood, and then just a horrible cry from Spock ""Kahn!!!!!!!!""

It turned my 9 into a nose dive. Not a bad film but the scene was pure SUPER HACK.... and that's just irritating and not necessary to this film, nor was it humorous.
Even after this I was looking forward to 5-7 more films with this cast..but JJ decided it was more lucrative to hack Star Wars and all three were total hack jobs with less substance than Episode IV,V & VI...with exception of IX being better than VI(not that goal was a hard accomplishment).",Star Trek Into Darkness
182,jb_campo,Excellent follow up to Star Trek Reboot,8,11 March 2015,"JJ Abrams returns in this sequel to the Star Trek reboot movies. Chris Pine, Zachary Quinto, Zoe Saldana and the new cast return. Kirk uses his discretion around a Prime Directive and his command is threatened. Suddenly a new bad guy surfaces and starts reeking havoc on Star Fleet. who is this guy - seems like a super human.Well only Kirk can go after this bad guy named Harrison, rogue ex-Star Fleet staff. Venturing into Klingon territory, we learn the truth about Harrison. We also learn the truth about some factions in Star Fleet. Kirk again needs to decide if he can do the right thing in face of tremendous pressure, as does Spock. A fine battle takes place between good and bad, with a surprise ending that long time trekkies will appreciate. Even tribbles play a key role.The movie is fast paced again. The acting and portrayal against the original characters once again is spot on, particularly Dr McCoy and Scotty. You gotta love these guys - you can see the cast is having a blast with this. You will too. I can't wait for the next installment in these new Star Treks. Enjoy.",Star Trek Into Darkness
183,badajoz-1,Abrams' Monumental Ego on show rather than a 'Star Trek' film!,3,5 June 2013,"The film bounds along, and that's all the good news! The film is just an arrogant aside from director JJ Abrams, who thinks he is untouchable and can get away with anything on screen, which includes giving the 'v' to both SciFi fans and 'Star Trek' devotees, as well as producing a lazy action flick in which he has lifted and plagiarised so much it is a positive embarrassment. Some of the CGI and action is OK, but we get a repeat of the spacesuit flying sequence from the first reboot by Abrams - run out of inspiration already? The plot is a repeat of several old Star Treks, except they did it better. Holes are all over the place - the worst when Benedict Cumberbatch manages to hide 72 of his mates inside photon torpedoes rather than revive them from their cryogenic state! Incredible and terrible all in one! The dialogue and characters have already run their course - anymore Spock and Kirk immature spats and I will scream! And as for snogging on the main deck - not even William Shatner's ego was that big! But the major central problem is that the villain is none other than old foe KHAN, played by that well known Asian actor Benedict Cumberbatch. He has no back story except he is a genetically engineered criminal mastermind like Lex Luthor - lazy or what! It would appear that the only villains allowed in Hollywood are English actors and North Koreans - certainly not BRICs! In a cameo, Leonard Nimoy even gives the character his full Asian sub-continent name - Othello can only be played by a black actor but Khan!!!??? No, the original episode on TV had far more heft and intellectual credibility than this sloppy popcorn ( and that's an insult to popcorn!) movie. But there was one moment of originality, bringing in Alice Eve as a scientist, like that original episode, dangled the possibility of a repeat of the brave New World and 'Botany Bay', but instead we find out that in the 23rd century women still wear 1980s black bra and panties! No, being an auteur has responsibilities, Mr Abrams, and you do not take them seriously. God help, Star Wars 7.",Star Trek Into Darkness
184,martinrobertson300482,Beam Scotty up!,6,15 May 2013,"I personally hated the last ""Star trek"" movie. It forgot about 40 years of history to make a cheesy, over the top ""Star wars"" rip-off, and did it with a ""Dawson's Creek"" style cast. Not that I'm a huge fan, but being well aware of the odd/even (odd numbered movies bad - even numbered movies good) rule, and with promise of this 12th instalment being ""into darkness,"" made me just about interested in giving the series all another chance.Now that I've seen it, I can see ""Star trek into darkness"" dividing audiences. I actually can't fault it this time around, because I enjoyed the most important part. Its story. The Plot is actually pretty damn clever. Throwing in new ideas, while reinventing old ones, and sometimes tying them in with the last movie in a way that actually works. Those who enjoyed the last film as a reboot may not like the hints toward the old movies as much (True, it does go a bit overboard with them) but to me, I was glad to see that this knows what it is, and isn't trying to be that other Space set series as much. Despite plenty of cool modern action.The Villain is the main draw of the movie though, and Benedict c*mberbatch Is awesome in the part. Even if the twist with his character may also divide audiences. Chris Pine is growing on me as Kirk, but not as much as Zachary Quinto Is as Spock. Both are given moments to shine in roles that still belong to William Shatner and Leonard Nemoy too most.What ruins the movie though is Simon Pegg as Scotty. I've given other actors the benefit of the doubt taking over their roles, but Pegg pretending to be Scottish is just embarrassing (and yes, that's because I'm Scottish). Scotty was always a stereotype. I'm not overly offended by this, more embarrassed because I usually love Pegg, but in these movies he just IS'NT FUNNY! They even make out like he's going to leave at one point too (Yay!) but that's only so he can get his own little side story (Sigh!)",Star Trek Into Darkness
185,ghost_dog86,No Ceti eel larvae?!,6,17 May 2013,"A disclaimer before I begin: I am not going to waste time during this review comparing ""Star Trek Into Darkness"" to 1982's ""Star Trek 2: Wrath of Khan"", because aside from the fact that ""Wrath of Khan"" is a substantially better film, these are two different movies, with two differing story lines and vastly differing villains (even if they do share the same name). In fact, if you hadn't noticed from the 2009 lens flare riddled installment, director J.J. Abrams has chosen to take the Star Trek series down a different path, instead of re-treading like so many remakes tend to do. And while they may hold some similarities, ""Into Darkness"" should not be considered a remake of ""Wrath of Khan"", but more so a re-imagining. Hence, this review will not be a comparative one. I won't talk about the fact that there are few men who can match the flamboyant cartoonishness of Ricardo Montalban's Khan, and Benedict Cumberbatch isn't one of them. I won't talk about the interestingly restructured, but very family friendly cop-out ending which is tacked on to this installment. And I won't even mention how unlike William Shatner, Captain Kirk is likely to be the only watchable role actor Chris Pine will play during his hopefully short lived career. I won't talk about any of that. This will be a straight up critique of ""Star Trek Into Darkness"" based on its own merits. Now, onto my review: After an act of terrorism on earth, Captain Kirk and the crew of the Enterprise must venture out into enemy territory to pursue a man, whom they suspect to be a rogue officer. But when they finally come face to face with him, he turns out to be a one man weapon of mass destruction. And his name happens to be Khan. If that means nothing to you, then stop reading now.While J.J. Abrams' direction is as flashy as expected, his constant need to explore every off-the-wall camera angle possible doesn't really do anything to propel the movie into warp speed (see what I did there?). What does work, is the reprisal of Zachary Quinto's magnificently dry depiction of Spock, who, along with a lively supporting cast which includes, Simon Pegg as Scotty, John Cho as Sulu, Karl Urban as Bones, Anton Yelchin as Chekov, Zoe Saldana as Uhura and a surprisingly ultra-comedic script, are the only reasons as to why ""Star Trek Into Darkness"" is entertaining at all.Benedict Cumberbatch as Khan: I am a huge Cumberbatch fan (just to get that out of the way) but his performance here honestly left me of cold. Let me rephrase that. The way Cumberbatch was utilized within the confines of this storyline was what left me cold. ""Star Trek Into Darkness"" contains one of the most underutilized villains in any science fiction film to date. During the first half of this movie, Khan is seen and described to be a superhuman-like being, who is touted to be nearly indestructible. But when Cumberbatch finally gets some heavy screen time, all Khan does is spend a few scenes speaking with a stern inflection and then a few more scenes punching people and getting punched, and then it's over. What a letdown.Even though the comedic moments in ""Star Trek Into Darkness"" move this two hour plus movie forward, sadly this ""action film"" contains only a few action sequences (and by that, I mean two) which were memorable or made me lean forward in my seat. And therein lies the main issue at hand. I don't want to say that anything visually about this film was poorly constructed, because it wasn't. This is also not a Michael Bay movie which contains an annoying overload of explosions. All of the action sequences here have their respective place. There are even moments (during the last hour) when Abrams creates an atmosphere of suspense, which promises potential, but (even with its highly eventful score) soon recedes into another bland or simply shrug inducing action sequence. I guess what I'm trying to say is, not much in ""Star Trek Into Darkness"" was all that impressive. And I am including the final battle sequence in that discussion.Final Thought: ""Star Trek Into Darkness"" is the type of movie which lives and dies on its audience's expectations. While ""Into Darkness"" is big budget, looks nice and is all and all a fine movie, the fact that it never became as engaging as I (along with a room full of men wearing Spock ears) expected it to be, is a problem. So, even though this is not a Sci-Fi film which will be scoffed at during upcoming episodes of ""The Big Bang Theory"", if you aren't a Star Trek fan, ""Star Trek Into Darkness"" isn't the movie that will convert you. In fact, for you the weighted melodrama within this film, may become far too irritating to stand after a while. And if you are a Trekkie, then chances are you've stopped reading a while back, upon noticing that this wasn't a five star review. In short, if you're a fan of Star Trek, then you're going to see ""Star Trek Into Darkness"" regardless of what I have to say.Written by Markus Robinson, Edited by Nicole I.

187,galahad58-1,Space Seed/Wrath of Khan Dumbed Down,6,23 May 2013,"To understand this review you may have to decide whether you are the kind of science fiction fan that enjoys a more cerebral show or a mindless eye candy fest. The original Star Trek had gaudy outfits,cheap special effects and a low budget; but it was filled with great characters and stories that mattered and addressed issues of our culture (race, greed, etc). Star Trek was more cerebral than most shows on television and that translated well to the movies. While the first Star Trek film was a complete bust, the franchise rebounded with The Wrath of Khan, The Voyage Home and The Undiscovered Country. Khan dealt with a madman intent on revenge while covering the main characters dealing with issues of growing older, finding out about their past and dealing with loss. Shatner showed the acting ability that garnished him stage roles prior to Star Trek. Some folks did not like Star Trek because it had a more cerebral approach and it was directed more at characterization and story over eye candy. Star Wars, on the other hand, was a complete mind-numbing juvenile series of movies that relied on eye candy because there was no acting and no storyline worth mentioning. This is what seems to appeal to the masses though. Now comes Abrams who turns Star Trek into a mindless fusion of Star Wars meets Transformers. The story lines are bad, very bad, and lack cohesiveness on every level. The movies have little to no character development and actually steal lines from the original to ""try"" and bring some sense of character to the film. Like The Transformers the movie is all about death, destruction on a mass scale and eye candy special effects.So what is good about this version of Star Trek? Karl Urban does a great job as McCoy and would do Deforest Kelley proud in his translation of the McCoy character; Zach Quinto does a nice job as Spock with the limited screenplay he has to work with; and Zoe Saldana fleshes out Uhura with more substance than the character has had before. Chris Pine is dreadful as Kirk and his portrayal (and the writings) kind of exhibit a dislike towards the Kirk character. Or it is an attack on Shatner. Kirk was not this wild, irresponsible, clueless, lack of leadership captain. In fact, Kirk was the kind of officer that service men would have wanted to serve under because he was fair, made good choices, cared for his crew and was a model leader.Your view of the movie will be dictated by how you view science fiction: if you are more cerebral and like the original Star Trek, Firefly, Farscape and shows on that level of existence you may find this movie to be cluttered junk. If you are a Star Wars, TV Stargate type of cardboard character, eye candy junkie than this is the movie for you.",Star Trek Into Darkness
188,Chalice_Of_Evil,A Star Trek film that even non-Trekkies can enjoy...,8,8 May 2013,"I will say upfront that I am not a Trekkie. Nor had I really watched anything Star Trek related before the 2009 reboot. Folks running around in different coloured shirts and one dude in a chair giving others orders never interested me. Same deal with ST09. I eventually hired it on DVD out of curiosity. I found it alright, but didn't see the big deal everyone was making out of it. So what compelled me to see the sequel at the theatre? Well, for starters, after having re-watched the first film on TV again leading up to the new film's release, I came to find myself liking the film a bit more than I had originally. I still wouldn't praise it as much us everyone else seems to, but I think I was more on board with it second time around. Before this, however, I'd had no intention of seeing Star Trek Into Darkness at the theatre. However, with my newfound appreciation for the first film, not to mention the new one including actors I'm a fan of (Alice Eve and Benedict Cumberbatch), Into Darkness drew my attention where ST09 originally didn't. I know very little about the Trek franchise other than the basics, but it seems these new films have taken into account those who might not be familiar with all that has come previously, and therefore they cater to new fans and old fans alike.Since all the introduction stuff to the universe/characters/etc was taken care of in ST09, Into Darkness is free to build upon that. Starting with Chris Pine as Captain James T. Kirk (or 'Captain James Tiberius Perfect-Hair', as Scotty calls him). I was put off by Captain Jerk in the first film (especially his treatment of Rachel Nichols' character. Just look at the deleted scenes on the DVD for further evidence), rolled my eyes at how easy things came to him and his overall attitude/the all-too-familiar type of character he seemed to be. While he still has some of that left in him here, he has also grown somewhat. Yes, he still breaks the rules, argues with Spock and gets into fistfights - but he has reason to (especially when it comes to not seeing eye to eye with Spock). The clash of personalities between Kirk and ""Pointy"" is where the heart of these movies lies. Pine and Zachary Quinto play off each other really well, and at times you can understand Kirk's frustration with the Vulcan. Quinto continues to do a good job playing Spock, even getting to show some actual emotion this time around. Actually...there's quite a LOT of emotional outpouring. Multiple characters shed a tear or two at different points in the film, verging on somewhat of a cry-fest (although most of it is warranted).Also warranted? That scream from Dr. Carol Marcus (Alice Eve) that everyone seemed to make a big deal of when the trailer was released. She just witnessed something head-crushingly horrific, so I'd say she was justified in her reaction. The other complaint I've heard about her character is regarding the scene of her in her underwear. It lasts for about 5 seconds, people! And I don't recall anyone complaining about Kirk watching Uhura undress in the first film, so why the outcry here? Carol is more than just a blonde bombshell in a Starfleet mini- skirt. While there is clearly the beginnings of something being set up between her and Kirk here, and she doesn't go unnoticed by Bones either (who can blame him?), she also helps save Dr. McCoy, displays smarts and attempts to save everyone else as well. I liked the dynamics set up between her & Kirk, her & Spock, and her & Bones. On the whole, she's a welcome new addition to the cast.Getting back to the villain. Cumberbatch, who most people would know from his excellent portrayal of Sherlock Holmes in the BBC series, makes up for the rather lacking villain in the first movie. He lends gravity to this film with his performance. Underwritten, underdeveloped, under-motivated? I didn't think so. I found there to be enough reasoning behind his actions, considering he's the villain (more than we get for some villains, anyway). Cumberbatch is utterly captivating whenever he's on screen. Those of us who've seen him in other things would expect no less.The rest of the characters all have their individual moments. Apart from the aforementioned dynamic with Dr. Carol Marcus, McCoy also has his amusing metaphors and constant fretting, Chekov and his accent get their moment of heroics (however hard it may be to believe), Sulu gets to sit in the chair for a brief period, and Scotty gets a serious increase in screen time from the first film. Uhura and Spock's relationship woes still hold no interest for me. And apart from fighting with him, she doesn't get to do much else. Although she does put her special knowledge of other languages to good use when she has a face-to-face chat with those of the bumpy-headed kind. She, Spock and Bones also prove pivotal near the end. Kirk, meanwhile, gets to show just how much he's grown as a person.Lens flares are in full swing, as to be expected from J.J. Abrams (even when there's really no point to them when someone's simply standing still, talking). He knows how to shoot action, though, and the scale of the film/effects on display are quite epic. But what it all boils down to in the end is the characters. If you don't care about them, then the film falls apart. I'm happy to say that you *do* grow to care about them, if you didn't already. Throw in what I imagine to be some nods to classic Trek lore for the fans, and you've got yourself a pretty enjoyable sequel.",Star Trek Into Darkness
189,daniewhite-1,Star Trek into Flash Gordon,2,14 November 2019,"When Star Trek reaches this point, there's only one conclusion: there is no point.At least in the hands of the people responsible for making the creative decisions on this film: there is no point.Stop making these Star Trek films. Stop making remakes!!! I sincerely believe that the lame and lacklustre, awfully constructed follow on 'Beyond' Star Trek film suffered it's box office disappointment, in part, in the dirty air that was this films trailing wake.In terms of technical credits this film sounds unlike Star Trek. In the character dialogue this film sounds unlike Star Trek. In the production design this film looks unlike Star Trek. In the character actions, motivations, reasonings, this film looks unlike Star Trek!So, if you are going to make a remake, at least make it Star Trek!! If you want to tell new stories, take new creative decisions, follow new directions with these films DONT MAKE REMAKES!!!In fact don't:
1) GO ""BACK"" IN TIME (to young Kirk and crew) of something that informed fans know with familial familiarity if you want to flex your creative muscle2) DONT MAKE REMAKES and especially not remakes that are terrible due to misunderstanding the film that's being remade.So really, don't make this film; if the intention is to milk Star Trek milk it properly: if the intention is to be creative BE creative.I can not give this film more than a couple of stars out of ten.....even the visual flair that marked the '09 'Star Trek' reboot has diminished; even the panache with which actors interpreted or impersonated the original cast characters in that film has dissipated.The remaining film is an awfully conceived Flash Gordon esque treatment due to its being a badly considered remake of a film, the source of which clearly wasn't understood.",Star Trek Into Darkness
190,Bruce722,Good but not as good as the first.,8,10 February 2015,"While Star Trek: Into Darkness was still a really good sci-fi film, it unfortunately failed to either live up to or exceed the standard set by the first film in this newly rebooted franchise. The acting by the entire cast, including additions Benedict Cumberbatch and Alice Eve, was fantastic and the special effects continued to be on par with the best in the business. I also thought Abrams did a good job continuing the development of the characters from the first film, making these movies really feel like they connect well. The only negatives with the film, in my opinion, stem from them not branching away from the original series. I didn't love that in the first film but I thought the ""alternate universe"" concept was an interesting way to stay true to the franchise source material while still allowing the writers a certain level of artistic freedom. That is no longer the case and Abrams' insistent on staying attached at the hip to the original was a weak point for me. While it felt like an interesting concept in the first film, it felt like lazy writing in this one. I really do hope they continue to build this story with more films because I love the universe and the cast but hopefully in future endeavors they leave Leonard Nimoy off of the cast list.",Star Trek Into Darkness

But at least they tended to be presented in a disciplined and thoughtful way.In this pile of dung we get lots of sound, lots of flash, and lots of energy -but it is like firework that falls over and fizzes instead of shooting spectacularly in to the air.Kirk is a shadow of the man from the 2009 movie. Bones is portrayed well but has no meaningful dialogue; just a series of clichéd outbursts.The last third of the movie is a pointless waste of time. despite having Kirk, Spock, McCoy and Bones this is not Star Trek.

His Star Trek movies are much faster, exciting, comparable with movies from Nolan and Snyder, but still I won't wear Spock pajamas in bed. I'm just not that geeky enough.One thing I don't like about prequels is that you know who just won't die. Spock and Kirk cannot die in J.J. Abrams' movies. But that did not make this movie less interesting or exciting, and that's a big plus. The movie gives you everything you don't expect and it never gets you bored.

193,Dragonsouls,"Different sort of Trek, but worthy of the brand.",8,15 September 2013,"Into Darkness shares a lot with the original, after all, it is a re-make, or better yet, a re-imagination of Wrath of Khan. When I first saw Into Darkness, I was a bit miffed at the fact that it felt smaller than Star Trek 2009. Less extras, no cool looking aliens, less sets, BUT, it had more CGI. That doesn't make the film feel...Epic! Nevertheless, Into Darkness was well directed, acted, and scripted...yes, scripted. The plot was simple, no different than the plot in Wrath of Khan. Both films were very different than the previous ones. The Motion Picture (1979) cannot be compared to Wrath of Khan...and Into Darkness cannot be compared to most Trek films either.With that said, I really enjoyed the character driven elements. Loved the Spock/Uhura relationship, the psycho-analysis of Spock and his logic, his conflicting feelings, due to being a human/alien hybrid. It was deep stuff and after the 2nd viewing, I said to myself--it's action heavy, and CGI heavy! So what!? The CGI was fantastic, seeing the enterprise zip around in brand new ILM fashion was a joy. At least the story was engaging enough not to consider it a CGI crap-fest! Overall, worthy of the Star Trek name, even without the Techno-babble, and philosophy.",Star Trek Into Darkness
194,Christopher_Reid,"Entertaining but flawed, enjoyable overall",6,29 March 2015,"I was actually kind of excited about this movie. As a kid I'd loved the Star Wars movies and knew them well but had never seen anything to do with the Star Trek universe. It's always been a mysterious world to me. Of course I've seen plenty of little snippets from the TV show, but only enough to know the very basics. The new Star Trek reboot seemed to be getting a lot of praise and I did find the previous film pretty enjoyable with lots of potential for good sequels.Into Darkness was very disappointing at first. It tries too hard to be dramatic and funny at the same time. It's paper-thin. I never liked J.J. Abrams' style - I thought Lost was awful and avoided it as much as possible although my family watched it. His characters are always arguing, staring at each other, sweating. They're always emotional, frustrated, flawed. The problem is they're always dumb. They don't think or solve problems. Or if they do, they do it in a very controlled way that is dictated by the script. It's hard to describe but everything he does seems far too controlled. I can't believe they're letting him reboot Star Wars as well, I think it's one of the worst movie-related decisions I've ever heard of but then that's another story...Once the actual plot of Into Darkness got going, I was more interested. At least it doesn't hold back much. It's like a kid playing with their toys - the good guys are nearly going to die but then something happens and they make a comeback and the bad guys escape and so on. Everything is done at the very last second. Everything is on the line, nothing is halfway. Spaceships can appear out of nowhere, chases can go on from one location to another, people can change sides or reveal secrets that change the situation.But also, the physics is what a 6-year-old might expect to happen in space. We hear the spaceships. As soon as a spaceship's power goes out, it immediately starts falling towards the nearest planet regardless of whether it's in orbit or not. Kirk tries to kick something into place but he keeps kicking it at the wrong angle which had me nearly yelling at the screen. There is warp speed travel and after an early, unexpected stop, the heroes are a whole 300 thousand kilometres away from their destination. That's a tiny distance in terms of space, it only takes light one second to travel that far. So really, they're right on top of their destination and probably should have actually exited warp even earlier. These are obvious, huge plot flaws. They are distracting because they are easy to get right. Especially when films like Interstellar are being made, we have a right to expect less stupidity and more ingenuity. The universe is an amazing place and we barely get any cool insight from these awfully dumb movies.Benedict Cumberbatch is the best part of the movie. He's intense and interesting to watch. His character has an air of mystery about him. He's powerful and his motives are unclear. He makes a very satisfying antagonist. The special effects are satisfying overall and most of the action is reasonably well directed. There were a few funny moments. The chase scenes were a bit exciting but often laughable as well.However, it's pathetic how much the film-makers tie themselves down to the original series. It feels like there are more references than new ideas. Just make your movie! Create something new! Take what you like from earlier movies and episodes and use that merely as your jumping off point! Being too big a fan of something really limits you as an artist and that seems to happen here. They're afraid to step out of expectations. There is not enough boldness or originality. Abrams makes formulaic stuff that ""pushes the boundaries"" in a very safe, PC, conventional way and this movie is no exception.",Star Trek Into Darkness

The sequel has all the good part of first one and adds new characters and drama with ease. Chemistry between Kirk and Spock remain electrifying. The visuals remain with you especially if you have watched it in 3D. Dialogues are filled with humor. The movie starts in 5th gear and then pace never drops.

197,TheOny13,As I grew older I started to enjoy this movie less and less,7,1 September 2020,"The first time I watched this movie was in 2013 when it was released and back then I liked it... a lot! But as I matured and began appreciating movies for their storytelling and their characters and themes not only for their action and pseudo-philosophical intelectuality, I started disliking this movie more and more.The Good: Benedict Cumberbatch was great as Khan. He was strong, fearless and brutal. About his intellect, that was just enough showed for me but he wasn't a genius or something. The action was good and intense at times. The soundtrack was amazing and that may be the only part that stayed the same for me. Giacchino does an incredible job again in this soundtrack as well as he did for other projects either before or after this one.And that is pretty much all the good about this movie that stayed with me.The bad: As time went by and I started to think about this movie many and many things started to not make sense anymore. Entire fleets are sent after a single person because... reason. People loose things in this movies but later everything happens so that they get them back without any struggle or without having to prove themselves to be up for them. People die but then they are revived so their sacrifice mean nothing and is made just for the sake of the action. People reveal themselves as if any of the characters should know that when they don't but the audience knows that. Motivations of the main characters are so contrived and illogical, that I wonder the writters only made the script as they went along. That has bugged me in a way ever since I've seen this movie.Overall I still enjoy somewhat this movie but it's not the same as it was years ago. Sometimes maturity means more clarity and for me this movie is not so good anymore, realizing now that this movie was begining to push plolitical propaganda in a franchise that I haven't seen at that time. I still haven't seen it now, but back then I was very rezilient of watching or respecting old franchises. Now I'm not anymore, and maybe that's why this movie is now worse than it was when I was watched it first, when btw I liked it. 7/10",Star Trek Into Darkness
198,JaydoDre,Greatly overrated but good looking and the action is nice,7,3 May 2014,"Ugh...The dialogue sucks. It has a ton of needless exposition and introduction. It is sometimes out of sync with what is going on, badly timed, odd, often nonsensical. Random example: there is a scene when Zulu is making a threat as part of the plan and his colleague Leonard says, ""Remind me never to p*ss you off"". That sentence is not applicable here because Zulu is executing a plan Leonard is partaking in. That sort of odd thing keeps breaking the immersion. I am surprised that so many people did not notice or did not have a problem with the wording in this movie.The screenplay has a few arguably useless scenes, but the situation improves as the movie picks up pace. Oh, it still very much has plot holes, but the film starts moving fast enough that you do not think about them too much. The best times are when the action kicks in. It is exciting and the new generation of computer effects look great, even when real items are placed against the computer generated ones, which in so many other movies makes the CGI look fake by contrast. Some of the more distracting scenes in the movie are that ones that involve fan-pondering because it is unnecessary and just does not work. A good movie reference is dropped discretely, perhaps as part of the background, and not as whole phrases or scenes taken from the old Star Trek movies. That just fits awkwardly. Though If you haven't seen the old Star Trek movies, this probably won't bother you.As for the actors, Chris Pine as main protagonist is rather generic. Yes, he expresses emotions when he is supposed to, but it doesn't feel like he has a distinct character, not even the one that the exposition of the movie keeps insisting he has. Simon Pegg makes for an excellent Scotty though. I'm glad he gets a lot of screen time here. Also, Benedict Cumberbatch does an excellent Hannibal Lector impression. If only the stuff he had to say was a little smarter then he could have totally pulled it off. To compensate for the less than great dialogue, he kicks ass physically. In fact, considering his coolness and considering his motivations, the movie does a bad job at making him appear evil. But I guess a good villain needs believable relatable motivations. As for the females, it feels like they are mostly there for mandatory eye candy. At least the film knows its audience. While the script is questionable, I do really like the art style and sound design of this film. The clean cool look of bright buildings and textured uniforms contrasts against the old stone and dark fiery destruction. Yes, there are too many lens flares, as many have pointed out, but it fits the style of the film and was not distracting to me.In short, Into Darkness is good looking, has great action but the drama in between the action is lacking quality. For the first time I really feel like IMDb should have a score available between 6 and 7.",Star Trek Into Darkness

The characters are caricatures of caricatures, the plot is totally at the mercy of the action requirements. A genius acts the fool one moment displays near invincibly on demand only to run in fear when some plot twist needs it to be so. Oh it's pointless even writing this.

200,JohnWelles,Boldly Going Where We've Been Before.,7,14 June 2013,"""Star Trek Into Darkness"" (2013), directed by J. J. Abrams, is the second in the rejuvenated Star Trek franchise, following on from the similarly-directed Abrams 2009 entry ""Star Trek"". The decision to start afresh was a wise decision. Paramount Studios allows new audiences to become enticed with a series that was struggling under the weight of continuity and limp direction.However, if Abrams seemed like a gust of fresh air in 2009, in 2013 his approach has been disappointingly safe. Instead of striking out for new ways of dealing with Star Trek, he has here relied too much on the tried and tested. Even the exhilarating opening sequence that encompasses fantastic art direction and costume design is actually reminiscent of one of the opening action scenes from Steven Spielberg's ""Indiana Jones"" series. The cinematography too, by Dan Mindel is excellent, the primary colours of the planet and the multitudes of flashing lights in the otherwise stark interior of the U.S.S. Enterprise stands out beautifully. The striking reds and whites of the opening sequence also help make this one of the best looking major studio films of the year so far.Yet Abrams handling of characterisation and dialogue is as assured as ever, revealing his training in American television. Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto as Captain James T. Kirk and Commander Spock respectively, enjoy an easy chemistry and banter that the rest of the crew, including Simon Pegg as Scotty and Karl Urban as Bones share. It is these character moments, chiefly in the first half of the film, that are the true highlights. Yet the film, like many other Hollywood blockbusters, is scared to be character-led, and opts for a generic revenge plot that tires itself with actions scenes that quickly lose their vitality and excitement.Still, Peter Weller is very good in an underwritten role, as is rising star Benedict Cumberbatch as Harrison.The main problem then, is the script, written by Roberto Orci, Alex Kurtzman and Damon Lindelof. Not the dialogue, which builds an engaging repartee, but the plot. Action films build towards a climax through constant reversals of fortunes for the protagonists, but here it is all deplorably linear, subplots done away with presumably by the logic it would complicate the film too much. The opposite effect instead occurring: it becomes very simple and straightforward, there being only one genuinely unexpected revelation, which is too little for a movie over two hours long.Still, ""Star Trek Into Darkness"" is entertaining, and made with a great deal of professionalism, in particular the special effects by Industrial Light and Magic, and is consistently well-acted and directed. It is just the recurring problem of today's mainstream Hollywood films that most refuse to take chances.",Star Trek Into Darkness
201,kunalkhandwala,Exhilarating fun in the final frontier,9,24 May 2013,"In the universe created by J.J. Abrams, the cultures of the past Trek genre define the actions the characters take against contemporary adversities and issues. Adroitly, he satisfies both the Trekkie in us as well as the ignorant big summer movie-goer. With his action-packed, thrilling homage to the series, Abrams takes The Enterprise boldly to where no man has gone before. 'Star Trek Into Darkness' is an immensely enjoyable summer movie that yet has the brain and heart for those who expect a journey onto the final frontier. James Kirk (Chris Pine) continues to be driven by his motivated instinct while being the rough-edged, rule defying Captain of Starship Enterprise. Against all his righteousness, he is always challenged by Spock (Zachary Quinto)'s logical and bookish persuasions that lead to some tongue-in-cheek conflict. After saving an endangered species from an impending volcanic eruption, Enterprise returns home to Star Fleet headquarters to the news of a terror attack on their London offices. The Mastermind is a rogue officer John Harrison (Benedict Cumberbatch) who subsequently attacks the emergency meeting of Officers. Thus begins the game of chess where Kirk and his crew have to outsmart, outmaneuver and outmatch Harrison and bring him to justice. But in their journey, they will encounter betrayal, vulnerability, a test of nerves and some Klingons. Scotty (Simon Pegg) has quit because he doesn't trust the torpedoes aboard the ship, Chekov is challenged with the ship's mechanical failures, Spock and Uhura (Zoe Saldana) are having a troubled relationship, Bones (Karl Urban) is ever tensed about Kirk's health and the mission's health and Admiral Marcus (Peter Weller) has cruel intentions for the Enterprise. In this scenario, Kirk will have to make some bold decisions while considering Spock's logical and moral notions if they have to overcome the unstoppable super-soldier and emerge unscathed from such adversity. Abrams' team of writers have a topical script that sets contemporary threats in a futuristic wartime. Action explodes in a frenzy as the script propels at warp speed, thus providing wholesome entertainment. Meanwhile, the strengths and idiosyncrasies of the Enterprise crew members are well exposed to lay the foundation for this franchise to expand. Chekov's charming lines such as 'Captain on the bridge!' set a new tone while Scotty's brilliance in the ship's engine room assures us of its longevity. Sulu is competent and finds occasional comfort in the Captain's chair and Bones adds a more humane and caring element. Uhura's audacity and dedication to the fleet are laudable whereas the new girl Carol (Alice Eve) looks to be a promising eye candy if nothing else. Thus, the supporting cast have chunkier roles with more emphasis on laying the foundation for their characters while justifying their purpose on the bridge. Quinto excels as Spock, whose half human-half Vulcan sensibilities can often times be perceived as cold heartedness. His matter-of-fact mannerisms are not always well received by Kirk or Uhura but as he exposes his reasoning, we witness Quinto's excellence in embodying the character. His fist fight with Harrison in the climax is ridiculously old schoolish compared to what we witness throughout the movie but that blame rests upon Abrams only. Chris Pine carries the burden of credibility very well. As the Captain, he may be reckless but he portrays focus, composure and wit in every situation. Pine depicts the multitude of emotions convincingly and establishes his presence in the company of Quinto and Cumberbatch.Benedict Cumberbatch proves why he is such a prized actor. Arguably the best Sherlock ever, Benedict has the power to express emotions in mild and serious situations in exemplary manner. It takes a long time to figure out if Harrison is truly evil or is he a pawn in a bigger war and therefore, his multi-dimensional character offered variety and depth for Benedict to portray and he did it brilliantly. As a mastermind who becomes a force to reckon with for the entire Star Fleet, Benedict leaves us admiring evil. J.J. Abrams has perhaps made the funniest and wittiest Star Trek and has also directed it into darkness. The evil is far superior for an ordinary captain and his crew to counter and it does take each of the characters to break away from their mould to overcome this threat. Abrams has brought the characters together as a team that we can get accustomed to while building those bonds through often quirky dialogue exchanges or heated confrontations. On the other hand, he depicts Starship Enterprise in all its grandeur in the scenes when it emerges from the ocean, as it frequently goes into warp and as it suffers damage in battles. Just like that, he connects the audience to the ship and its crew for the many journeys that are in store. Abrams did not redefine a genre here. Instead, he opened up a genre to the general movie-goer by keeping it entertaining enough for a big summer movie. Hardcore trekkies may find few flaws in the story-line but they will appreciate the subtle references to the plots and characters of the previous films and TV shows. The visual effects team will leave the creators of 'Oblivion' applauding for them at the award ceremonies with the stunning work in creating the future San Francisco and London while depicting other worlds and the beauty of space as Enterprise leaves its Warp trails. Into Darkness is a solid followup to 2009's 'Star Trek' and it paves the way for journeys into the final frontier with Starship Enterprise while satisfying geeks and alluring mere mortals. With a talented team of writers who assisted in 'Lost', a visual effects team that sets a pretty high bar and some dedicated, versatile actors who could enliven their characters, J.J. Abrams provides a rich, vivid and thrilling escape into space that has loads of entertainment to be a summer blockbuster. Beam yourself down to the nearest theater....9.102 on a scale of 1-10.",Star Trek Into Darkness
202,fredschaefer-406-623204,A Star Trek for the 21st Century.,9,31 May 2013,"I have seen every episode of the original Star Trek series multiple times and every single movie thereafter, but I do not and never have considered myself a Trekker or Trekkie or whatever the hell they call themselves; I am simply a fan of good storytelling and great adventure.And I must say that STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS is up there with the best of them for the following reasons:The cast, which takes these iconic characters and makes the roles their own by echoing the original actors, but never stooping to an imitation. Chris Pine's Captain Kirk is brash, and reckless, while Zachary Quinto's Spock is a Vulcan to the core with a repressed human side that is always just under the surface. We stop comparing them to Shatner and Nimoy (who makes a pertinent cameo)and let them fully inhabit their characters. The same for Karl Urban (McCoy); Zoe Saldana (Uhura); Simon Pegg (Scotty); John Cho (Sulu); and Anton Yelchin (Chekov). With STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS the characters from the Trek universe take a huge step toward ascending to the level of Gulliver, Victor Frankenstein, James Bond and Sherlock Holmes.Which brings me to the second great thing about the film: The villain. In Benedict Cumberbatch's ""John Harrison"" the crew of the Enterprise is given an epic foe equal to the story's great heroes. Of course anyone familiar with the Trek canon will quickly figure out ""Harrison's"" true identity. The casting of Cumberbatch is spot on and a another great example of how an iconic character can be made fresh and new again. It also proves how it is not always necessary to cast a big star in the villain role; just get an actor who is perfect in the part i.e. Gert Frobe as Goldfinger.The third great thing about STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS is the way it takes WRATH OF KHAN and turns it on its head, rewriting the original and keeping the most memorable moments, while at the same time making it all seem fresh and original. The final thing that makes INTO DARKNESS so great is J.J. Abrams's direction, which pulls off the difficult feat of making a big budget science fiction epic that never allows its characters to be overwhelmed by the special effects, which are always there to serve the story and not the other way around. Of course there are some gaping logic holes in the script (Why are children still getting ill if a potential cure has been around for three hundred years?). Let it be reiterated: the science of the Star Trek universe was never meant to be factually sound. And does every movie have to be a comment on the War on Terror?Still, Abrams has done the legacy of Gene Roddenberry proud; let's hope he does the same by George Lucas. No, let's hope he improves on the legacy of George Lucas.",Star Trek Into Darkness
203,seaview1,The Brilliance of STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS,9,27 May 2013,"J. J. Abrams (Super 8, Alias, Fringe, Lost) has excelled in television and movies particularly resurrecting Star Trek by reinventing its essence for new audiences while respecting its origins. In Star Trek Into Darkness, he expands on keys characters and continues his mastery of plot and non-stop action. As summer entertainment, it is a class act and sends the science fiction/adventure series on a spectacular trajectory. It is also the best Star Trek movie since The Wrath of Khan.Captain Kirk (Chris Pine) and Dr. McCoy (Karl Urban) are pursued by a primitive tribe on an alien planet as Mr. Spock (Zachary Quinto) attempts to prevent a catastrophic volcanic explosion from within. Their activities call into the question The Prime Directive where nothing should alter a civilization from without. In fact, Kirk's outrageous, rule-breaking behavior gets him in hot water with mentor, Captain Pike (Bruce Greenwood) and Starfleet. At the same time, a horrifying explosion in London reveals the presence of a mysterious man (Benedict Cumberbatch) named John Harrison, who exhibits a remarkable intellect and physical prowess. The cryptic Harrison is pursued to Kronos, home planet to the warrior race of Klingons and the threat of all out war. Overseeing the mission directive is Admiral Marcus (Peter Weller) whose presence is felt in unexpected ways. It all leads to a revelation that threatens not only the Enterprise, but Starfleet and Earth.As the original TV series often dealt with contemporary issues, there are strong parallels with current headlines in the form of terrorism. In fact much of the film has a grim, dark tone as the crew must face a superior, ruthless adversary, and a couple scenes of mass destruction have a 9/11 feel. There are a number of references to the old TV series and original Trek films as names, locales, music, and even dialogue are lifted and cleverly interjected. Tribbles, anyone? And you've got to love those retro uniforms especially Saldana's! Pike and Kirk have what amounts to a father-son relationship, and this is tested in a pivotal moment. We witness this relatively new crew as it becomes more cohesive under duress, and that is part of the fun as we watch McCoy's character and the beginnings of his amusing, trademark gripes. There are plenty of heroics from our stars, and Scotty (Simon Pegg) and Uhura (Zoe Saldana) shine in key moments. You only wish to see if the classic trio (Kirk, Spock, and McCoy) could mix it up more, but you do see the core beginnings of their dynamic bond. There are strong, recurring themes of loyalty and sacrifice for the good of the majority, or in other words, ""the needs of the many"" Cumberbatch, (TVs current Sherlock Holmes) is outstanding as a powerful adversary. Weller is particularly effective as the imposing Admiral with a hidden agenda.The visual effects are impressively on display when the starship Enterprise explodes into warp speed and when devastating terrorist acts decimate a major city. The pacing is quite good, so don't think too hard on credibility gaps. Where does Harrison come from? Anybody check his blood type? Why is Starfleet headquarters virtually unguarded? And what's the deal on those torpedoes? Abrams is a master showman and he knows how to engineer cliffhangers upon cliffhangers. The film has a memorable climax that will ring déjà vu with a twist, but is nonetheless quite emotional. It solidifies the Kirk-Spock relationship forever and could have served as one of the best endings in Trekdom, but the filmmakers chose to springboard to another exciting moment which leaves the door open for future adventures of the five year kind. To say any more would spoil things. A third film in this installment would be hard pressed to surpass the energy and sheer acumen he demonstrates in this sequel, but Abrams has proved he can followup a directing gig by remaining the producer with another talented director taking the reigns and still achieve spectacular results (see Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol). For the man who has been chosen to take over Star Wars franchise, the sky's the limit.",Star Trek Into Darkness
204,achyutaghosh,Utterly familiar yet exceptionally original- 9/10,9,11 May 2013,"2009's Star Trek is the best remake of a franchise ever, while 1982's Wrath of Khan was perhaps the best movie in the original franchise, credited with saving Star Trek as we know it, after the debacle that was the 1979 Star Trek movie. So what do you get when you marry the creative team of the 2009 re-imagining and folklore from the 1982 classic? A cerebral thrill ride that is action packed, dramatic, funny at the same time staying true to the TV series and films, along with restoring the one weakness of the 2009 movie- the lack of a grand villain. The film picks up from around the point the earlier one ended. The team is no longer greenhorn but Kirk and trouble continue to go hand in hand. So right at the outset we are plunged into chaotic urgency, when Spock dives into a volcano to save a primitive culture from annihilation, Kirk and Bones escape spears that rather come whizzing straight at us in 3D and the Enterprise rises out of the sea to both- play god and save the day. But the Prime Directive of not to interfere with a planet's culture is broken even though Spock and the planet is saved, and Kirk is set to lose command of the Enterprise. But surprise attacks on Starfleet by a supremely gifted terrorist- John Harrison leaves the earth in turmoil. Kirk regains the Enterprise and is tasked by Starfleet commander Marcus (Peter Weller) to assassinate Harrison who has taken refuge in a Klingon planet. Harrison later on reveals himself to be Khan- a genetically enhanced being who was being used by Marcus to develop advanced weaponry so as to eradicate the Klingons once and for all. Khan is potentially unstoppable, a superhuman, capable of singlehandedly taking out battalions and is faster, stronger and smarter than the best humans have to offer. How does the crew of the Enterprise stop him? In the end though, justice is served, and the battle won, but not before San Francisco takes one for the team. The returning actors slip onto their roles with minimal fuss. While Oblivion was driven by cinematography, and Downey completely owned Iron Man 3, the entire Star Trek team are stars here. Friendship, heroism, and sacrifice- all the ideals of Star Trek are happily on display, often from unexpected quarters. The heart of Star Trek has always been the relationship between the brash and instinctive Kirk and the logical, cautionary Spock. Rivalry and comradeship both are exhibited, and towards the end they kind of reverse the roles- Kirk does what Spock would have done because it would have been logical, and Spock in turn takes out a page from his captain's book. It is a hyper active, energetic ride, filled with character based gags and clever one liners. JJ Abrams has ensured Star Trek into Darkness matches up to its predecessor in every way, but out-punches it in one crucial round- the villain. Benedict Cumberbatch is menacing and sinister as Harrison/Khan. People familiar with BBC's Sherlock know that he has a magnetic personality- here he is scene stealing as a complex and ruthless nemesis who believes in his villainy, and executes it with style and grandeur. The 3D effects are a bit inconsistent, but the action is intense and creative throughout, whether it is simple fisticuffs or giant spaceships blowing each other to smithereens. In short Star Trek Into Darkness it is utterly familiar AND exceptionally original. Do Trekkies and other mortal beings need anything more? The sci-fi world has long been divided among Trekkies and Star Wars. It is now public that the same team that infused new life into the Star Trek series will work on the reboot of the Star War series too. So the popcorn does not end here, folks- come 2015, the Star War fans will have their day. Till then venture into this breathlessly paced darkness and come out energized! 9/10",Star Trek Into Darkness
205,Come-and-Review,ah trekkies just nerdily insulting this,10,24 November 2014,"Again a movie that is badly considered by franchise fans, what is wrong with you people!?!Many Star Trek Classic fans hate this, cause it goes too dark and is different from the original series. Too much action, too much changes.What is wrong with these people? We're 40 years later the original star trek, it's mathematical this is different. I must say I don't like the old series, not mainly because of the storyline, but mostly because it ruined even the image people have of star wars, confusing themselves between the two franchises. THat is unacceptable, Star wars is way superior to star trek in most of its points.This movie has action, great FX, smart story, real emotions (that mostly were absent in the old series), and great acting. I really see no reason to hate this, except for the only half- gory scene and the huge amount of bad-words.Overall, liked really much this movie, and think this reboot actually didn't ruin the franchise, but saved it: most of nowadays people don't like that slow-movie with awful effects thing like star trek, even worse, mistakingly consider it star wars, this way underrating Lucas' series, and this is exactly what new audiences (including me) like.",Star Trek Into Darkness
206,mgruebel,Devolution into Darkness,5,21 December 2013,"It is interesting how a concept finally evolves, or devolves, to adapt to changing times. The original Star Trek TV series was built on the premise that humans would solve their problems at home and then explore the universe, that racial equality, lack of need for monetary currencies, and the US and Russians being buddies would be the norm. It also dissected a human mind's emoting-reasoning-deciding process into the open, making each a separate character in the McCoy-Spock-Kirk trio. It was sheer joy to watch Kirk listen to his emotions and to his logic, and then act decisively. Star Trek was ahead of its time (as the best sf is), a cultural spearhead of the mid-60s to 90s.Abrams clearly does not understand any of this, and serves up a particularly mindless action and special effects concoction, in keeping with the times. In previous installments, the Khan antagonist's motivation was conquest of the universe, or revenge against Kirk. Here it seems to be revenge against a secondary character whose motives are revealed in passing towards the end of the film! And the secondary character is a high-up in the Federation, so much for humanity solving its problems and exploring the universe. The talents of Benedict Cumberbatch (think of a film like ""The Imitation Game""!) are sadly wasted here.The movie treads no new ground, everything from aerial car chases, to the buddy-I-can-see-but-not-touch death scene has been done better elsewhere, either in previous installments of the franchise, or in other films.Sadly, the film does not bring Star Trek to a new generation of moviegoers. It brings sf/action du jour, borrowing a few names and the general shape of a starship from Roddenberry's vision, but nothing else, to a new generation of moviegoers.",Star Trek Into Darkness
207,axlrhodes,"You might feel like you've been here before, but a worthwhile trek.",8,24 May 2013,"Surprisingly, it's been four years since we first met J.J Abrams' sexy, rebooted crew of the U.S.S Enterprise. In that time, you might be forgiven for not fully being able to recall exactly what happened first time around. The good news is, that doesn't really mattermuch.Without wasting a second or pausing for breath, 'Into Darkness' hurls us head-first into the chaos in a scene that owes a huge debt to Spielberg's 'Raiders of the Lost Ark'. From then on, it's time to get reacquainted with our old/new friends as the plot centre's on a terrorist attack in future London -spot the Gherkin.What's pleasing about Into Darkness is that it's fun. Lots of fun. Abrams continues where he left off last time by keeping his film accessible and quick witted. For the die-hard Trekkie, the tone might still be too much brawn and not enough brain but given the track record of the odd/even numbered cinematic Trek's, it's a relief to finally get some consistency into the universe. In terms of character development, Chris Pine's Captian Kirk is 'as you were'. Arrogant and still with an eye for the ladies, Pine lacks the out-and-out charisma of William Shatner's iconic turn, but leads the line firmly in a physically demanding role.The truth is, Star Trek isn't trying to be 'The Empire Strikes Back', no- it's intention is to engage warp speed and visually thrill your pants off and for the most part, it succeeds. If there's a show stealer here though – and there is – it's in Benedict Cumberbatch's good old fashioned bad guy, John Harrison. The British actor revels in the role and brings a gravity to outer space that takes the film to a higher level whenever he's on screen. From the delivery of the lines, to the sheer presence and physicality of the performance, Cumberbatch is a joy throughout. Also, and once again Zachary Quinto's Spock is the pick of the Enterprise bunch. It's been said before, but if ever an actor were born to play a roleGetting full value out of Into Darkness, beneath the surface of it's light hearted, lens flared and colourful exterior might require a Star Trek history lesson. There are important things that happened in older movies that many younger viewers will never have seen, but for them, there's the fun of the discovery later down the line and for those of us who need no introduction, there's a sense of satisfaction that this alternate universe Trek is working out a lot better than anyone dared dream.",Star Trek Into Darkness

The only way the dumb and random title makes sense if the ""writers"" mean the deliberate departure from the bright light that Star Trek used to be, not to mention pure drivel penned by two awful 9/11 truthers and this nonsens has that conspiracy slobbered all over it.This did not need to exists and its existence at best does not take away value from culture as a whole, but who are we kidding? This drivel chips away at minds everywhere.Not that I'd wish that people took their lives lessons from TV shows, even if they are sometimes deep and profound, but why this?

209,budmassey,"Stunningly, startlingly brilliant.",10,21 May 2013,"The Star Trek franchise has been mined for decades practically to depletion. And while little would be gained from endlessly resuscitating the canon version, it seemed nevertheless a courageous, almost dangerous act to so completely reboot a body of work that has worked through ten movies and six series and wipe the slate clean as Abrams did with this film's predecessor. For a true Star Trek fan, it was a hard pill to swallow at first, but only at first.J.J. Abrams' courage gave us almost everything we love most about Star Trek, with the inevitable exception of those things we could not have – the original cast. The characters remain in place, gamely reimagined at the beginning of their careers, rather than, as we eventually came to know them, at the end. Of course, it would have been easy to expect a new and improved telling of the canon, complete with new and improved visual effects. Instead, we got a stunning opportunity to see our beloved comrades explore new adventures without the necessity, or tedium, of a simple retelling.In this sequel, however, Abrams constructs delicately, almost lovingly, a story where familiar elements are unavoidable, but one where they are weaved into a thoroughly satisfying and viscerally thrilling path to endless years of new delight for Trekkers everywhere.The cast are learning to occupy their roles, with one notable exception. Zachary Quinto is positively delightful as Spock, a role he clearly shows the ability to wear comfortably and expand in surprising new directions. Simon Pegg is Scotty on Steroids – funnier, crankier, and vastly more entertaining. Perhaps most impressive is Karl Urban as McCoy. He is spot on perfect, almost disturbingly so, portraying McCoy just was we would have expected, while at the same time compensating for some of the thespian shortcomings of DeForest Kelly.The glaring disappointment is Chris Pine as Kirk. Pine lacks even a hint of the powerful machismo of William Shatner, depending instead on simple unwarranted bravado. He comes across less as a hero and more of a simple jerk, and his wanton womanizing is less romantic than simply debauched. It is perhaps ironic that Shatner, long lambasted for his acting, ends up being the most difficult actor to replace convincingly.To be fair, a fully satisfying replacement was probably not possible, as Shatner, for all his limitations, has, after decades of accretion, evolved into a once in a lifetime commodity. Still, it is difficult not to see Pine as miscast. But then, who? Channing Tatum? Chris Hemsworth? Most likely unavailable, so we have Pine.The story is pure gold, pure Star Trek. It draws upon familiar themes and characters and casts them in brilliant directions. At times, this film seems almost a tribute to the legacy Abrams seemed to be totally rejecting in the prequel. Stunningly, startlingly brilliant and persuasive evidence that Abrams is the only man with whom fans can entrust, not only our beloved Star Trek, but, it turns out, the other crown jewel of Sci-Fi fandom – Star Wars, the new episode of which Abrams will also direct.I wondered during the movie whether those less familiar with the Star Trek canon would appreciate the many subtle inside jokes and references. To be sure, there were many that were not so subtle, but it seems obvious that people who are relatively uninitiated with get less out of the movie than hard core fans.I'm not even going to discuss the plot details. Suffice it to say that nobody should leave the theatre disappointed, no matter what they were expecting. As for me, I left feeling as though all my years of devotion to Star Trek were fully rewarded, and renewed by this, one of the most magnificent achievements in the series' nearly half a century of delighting fans of all ages.",Star Trek Into Darkness
210,Jakealope,"It is not a bad movie, but it sucks anyways",3,9 October 2013,"Star Trek spawned many feature films starring the crews from the original series, Kirk, Spock, etc and Next Generation, Picard, Worf, etc TV series & one with a mix of the two. Honestly, most of those movies were schlock, far worse than this one many levels. But they were the real ST deal, since they had the real actors and Roddenberry's guidance behind them.The three following TV series, while having their faults, continued the ST tradition. Even the retro last one, Enterprise, did okay until it degenerated into mindless alien fights like the one with time traveling alien baddies where they all went back to alt reality Earth 1944 to fight Nazis & aliens. Any sci fi that needs a Nazi plot should pack it up!This movie, while very competently made, is a fake. Abrahms is good at characters, but the characters from the Original Series have been etched into our collective consciousness for decades so imitating them is no big deal, I am sorry. They did a good job of trying, but it just flopped. Pine is not Shatner, and lacked the level of genial pomposity and arrogance that Shatner used to make Kirk. Not can Quinto hold a candle to Nimoy. And bringing Nimoy on board as Old Spock, a double Spock trick, via time travel was really grasping at plot straws. The Khan character substitute just sucked & redoing an old TV show then movie plot line reeked of desperation. Star Trek is supposed to explore new planets, new civilizations, new life forms. Okay, some of that was corny like the Chicago Roaring 20s gangster world, but even that was fun. But all Abrahm's two reboots did was recycle the same old characters, planets & species. For instance the opening scene where they saved the stone age inhabitants of the red planet while visusally arresting, missed the mark. Kirk & McCoy were obviously observing, possibly interacting with the aliens before it started with them being chased. But did Abrahms ""bore"" us with the previous interactions with the primitives or why were the duo walking on the surface near them to begin with? Nope, they were just there to be chased then the two jump off a cliff into the water, yadda yaddaIt is an epoch failure since it missed the whole ethos of Star Trek in favor of Bondian Star Wars action and slapstick",Star Trek Into Darkness
211,Ar_Pharazon_the_golden,Somewhat disappointing,6,20 July 2013,"Star Trek into Darkness does not boldly go where no one has gone before. It's a decent film, very close in spirit to Star Trek history and lore, but offers no surprises. The plot is predictable all the way through, the messages are clean-cut and straightforward, the secondary characters transparent. Most irritating, for me, was the writers' scientific illiteracy. Yes, large scale science fiction can't usually be very accurate in its science, and lots of things here are the series' legacy, so they're untouchable. But Spock's volcano freezing device at the start of the film, for example, or the c-movie resurrection via blood transfusion after a casual stroll in a nuclear reactor core at the end, are pushing it a little too far. Especially the latter is as cliché a plot device, as it is a bad one. Another, minor, point of criticism, is that there is little in the visual sector - alien planets, space, etc. But since the Enterprise hasn't yet embarked on its mission, this is logical.On the other hand, despite my criticism, this is still a more enjoyable film than the majority of sci-fi blockbusters (I'm looking at you, After Earth). The action scenes are excellent, the cast is very good as a whole, even when they're just imitating the original series (though I think Chekov's heavy accent has aged badly as a character trait), and of course, Benedict Cumberbatch is an excellent choice for the villain. Again, however, while I find the praise for his performance justified, I think his role was much smaller than it ought to have been to make him one of the all-time great villains.All in all, it feels like JJ Abrams is navigating the Enterprise without taking any risk - he doesn't want to crash it, so he does everything by the book. In that sense he is most unlike Cpt. Kirk.",Star Trek Into Darkness
212,Tehmeh,Oh boy.,6,13 November 2013,"This is a hard film to review. I still don't know exactly how I feel about it. I understand how this is a film so many have problems with and yet so many love it.I was never a die hard Trekkie, but I did enjoy much of the series (original and NG) and some of the movies. I kind of liked the 2009 Star Trek reboot movie. I gave it an 8, mostly because I liked the casting and it was good to see a Trek movie again. This, however, seems to be harder to swallow. The same things that make it good for some, make it worse for others. Two sides of the coin.These are the things I like: 1) The cast is still very solid, and adding the characters of Benedict Cumberbatch along with Peter Weller just screams casting quality.2) It's not boring, not for a second. It's paced like many films nowadays: plenty of action, humor and grand happenings.3) It looks really good.4) The overall story is good enough if you don't stop to think about it too much.--------------- These are the things I didn't like (the other side of the coin): 1) Casting aside, the main characters are written as simplified versions of the originals and to act a little out of character at times. This wouldn't bother me so much, if much of it wouldn't be cliché-ridden filler. It is true that the 2009 movie had simplified characters as well, but it's harder to forgive second time around.2) Even though the film isn't boring, it feels like it just pushes forward with haste, not giving the story/characters enough room to breathe and taking away from the dramatic potential the story had. Sometimes I felt I was watching a modern action-packed computer game. All of this takes away from the deeper layers of the story and there's really some stupid stuff crammed into the movie - ""just because"".3) While the movie looks good, I couldn't get over the lens flares. They're everywhere. Almost in every scene, tons of them. I don't even feel like I'm nitpicking, since this was clearly deliberate. Enough is enough.4) While the story is decent, there's a lot of stuff that's ripping off ""Wrath of Khan"". We already knew that, and it probably wouldn't be a problem if the rest of the story wouldn't feel lazy and cheap, much of which is recycled from the 2009 movie too. When you really think about the main plot and motivations/actions of certain characters, it stops making much sense. Lazy writing for a SciFi movie, decent writing for an action movie.That's it. I did somewhat enjoy the experience and I'll rate this a 6/10, but I also feel the waste of potential. The first movie surprised me 4 years ago. This on the other hand...while it's not bad, it feels disappointing, recycled, unintelligent and more of an action film where details do not matter than a movie worthy of the title ""Star Trek"". This is an action movie that happens to take place in space, not a SciFi movie at its heart. I don't consider myself to be a fanboy and I can often forgive many flaws in a movie (I gave ""Prometheus"" an 8), but when the ""flaws"" are products of deliberate choices from the production team and a side effect of modernizing every franchise into the same kind of pretty, expensive and easy mess, I'm certainly going to cry about it on the internet like a fanboy. Just like now!",Star Trek Into Darkness
213,CMTiago,Stakes are high as Kirk fights for his family,7,19 January 2014,"Not being a huge Trekkie, I wasn't particularly interested in watching this sequel to the rebooted franchise. But given its obvious box office success and consequent Oscar nomination, it climbed in my watch list and I experienced STID. I believe that the first Star Trek from Abrahams is a bit overrated, as I find it to be a welcomed adventure film but not worthy of the rating it scores. Having said that I would probably put this entry in a similar spot as its predecessor. It offers a wide variety of thrills and uncertainties, while presenting us with emotional sides to most of the main characters. As any Star Trek fan would agree, Kirk, Spock and Khan are the most highlighted characters in the film and they all are played with the right kind of charisma. Pine once again offers determination and leadership as James Kirk, a irreverent man who will do anything to keep his crew (family) safe. Quinto is spot on as Spock, a Vulcan that's calculating but also influenced by his human half to not only serve Kirk in the right manner, but also to connect affectionately with Uhura. Finally the MVP of the movie is clearly Benedict Cumberbatch, who is superb as Khan, a ruthless villain that shows a huge psychological advantage throughout the film, until he meets his ultimate demise.Star Trek Into Darkness is a fun and great movie experience. Some fans may complain about its lack of greatness and its detachment from Trek themes, but since I am not a die hard fan, I don't feel there's anything to bicker about.Rating 7/10",Star Trek Into Darkness
214,jmillerdp,"The End of ""Star Trek""",1,31 May 2013,"There are many valid reasons why the most passionate ""Trek"" fans consider ""Into Darkness"" the worst of the ""Star Trek"" movies. To me, it is all about there being no ""Star Trek"" in ""Into Darkness."" The screenwriters, who ""wrote"" the first two ""Transformer"" movies here just use the ""Star Trek"" characters and settings as pieces on a game board to move around as needed so they can get to big explosions and mindless action.You hear from ardent fans often about ""canon."" That is, what is official, true to the storyline material, and what isn't. Well, for me ""Star Trek"" movie canon ended when Gene Roddenberry's involvement did, after 1979's ""Star Trek: The Motion Picture."" He was never involved in the ""Trek"" films after that. He was listed as ""Executive Consultant,"" but had no input I know of. So, from ""Wrath of Khan"" on, I consider it all like I would fan fiction. It's just stuff made up by people who were never involved in the original ""Star Trek.""At least there were moments from some of those secondary films that felt kind of like ""Star Trek."" But here, screenwriters Orci and Kurtzman chuck it all for good by not caring at all. Orci's gone after any critics, saying he's ""The Decider"" about ""Star Trek."" The fact that he used the same identifier that George W. Bush did should tell you all you need to know!What makes the script even worse is the involvement of Damon Lindelof, who famously trashed ""Prometheus,"" then got angry at those who dared criticize that disaster.The most troubling aspect is having director J.J. Abrams at the helm. He's been given the reins to ""Star Wars."" And, judging by his complete inability to recognize an awful script casts some serious doubt on his taking over a franchise that still has the potential that ""Star Wars"" does.Orci, Kurtzman and Lindelof basically try to cram two plots into one movie: You have the Federation conspiracy plot with Peter Weller, and the Khan plot. I personally think they should have gone with one or the other. Because trying to have both turns the movie into a complete jumble!What knocks this movie out, and sends it on a one-way trip to the canvas, is when the ""Star Trek II"" references keep on coming, until the final one that had me wanting to crawl under my seat! Except for the Visual Effects, most everything else is workman like, at best. Michael Giacchino pretty much replays his lackluster score from 2009's first ""Trek."" Cinematographer Daniel Mindel primarily has the task of getting Abrams' rightly-joked-about lens flares in. The acting is okay, but pretty straight forward, with the exception, of course, of Cumberbatch as Khan. He is great, but there is only so much he is given to do. That is why it could have been better to go with an all-Khan script instead of messing around with the Weller conspiracy stuff.The post-conversion 3-D by Stereo D is excellent! This movie is completely unwatchable without the 3-D. The one entertaining part of seeing the movie in 3-D is how the Stereo D folks had to deal with the seemingly-endless lens flare! It is basically at the forward of the frame, with the action behind it.Orci and Kurtzman are already onboard to ""write"" the third ""Trek."" So, like the unfortunately upcoming ""Man of Steel"" sequel, ""Trek"" 3 should already be avoided with extreme prejudice, without a single frame yet being shot.** (2 Out of 10 Stars)",Star Trek Into Darkness
215,grumpy-3,Better than the first one,9,4 May 2013,"Well its been 4 years, and here it is, saw it last night, with much anticipation, because of the title i really thought that this was going to be Nolanised, and disappoint me as the two dark knight films had. silly title really as its not dark at all. the breezy humour between the characters is still there, JJ signature len's flare is still there and it rattles along at 300 miles an hour. the two hour plus running time just flew by, and no sooner had we sat down, the film had come to a brilliant, moving and satisfying end. i am not going to disclose any of the plot or who is who, just to say that they have certainly built on and taken the characters further, they have also brilliantly referenced star trek lore, bridging the past with this great new time line. the 3d once again was utterly pointless i will be hoping to see it again if i can find a big screen that will be showing it in 2d, they have got to stop this 3d nonsense, if you are going to use 3d them make the 3d count and give us scenes of things coming at you. 3D MAKES THE SCREEN AND EVERYONE AND EVERYTHING IN IT SMALLER. NOTE TO ALL FUTURE SPECTATORS TAKE YOUR GLASSES OFF Occasionally AND YOU WILL SEE THE DIFFERENCE. anyway still did not ruin a great film and a great time.",Star Trek Into Darkness
216,jephtha,"Feels more like an extended TV episode, which is the mark of a lesser installment",6,11 May 2016,"One of the many eternally pointless disputes of the last few decades is the rivalry between the Star Trek and Star Wars franchises. It's a topic I prefer to avoid because there really is little to discuss beyond a few points. Aside from the obvious difference in objectives and style, both franchises have a different dominant medium; it is utter folly to compare a television series to film. However, purely as a film series, Star Wars is the clear winner. Despite varying opinions on the quality of the individual Lucas-helmed movies, the Star Trek film series' episodic nature prevents it from achieving the scope and flow of its rival. Most of the individual movies don't complement each other, leaving half of them feeling more like bloated episodes of the television series' than big theatrical events. Why do I start on this brief point? I was originally let down by the fact that ""Into Darkness"" doesn't lend itself to a larger tale, but have since come to accept that that's a given with these movies. What really cements this potential problem is that the plot lacks the momentum of a feature length production. The first half is too splintered, shamelessly dropping in elements that weren't present in the previous movie and not exploring them fully. Wouldn't the big machination by Admiral Marcus have had greater impact if we had gotten to know this guy earlier, or actually explored the nature of the Klingons from this timeline? Because so many things are shortchanged (like the Spock/Uhura relationship), the movie feels like it's scrambling about to find its footing, until the second half that features a drawn out jaunt into space. For a better example of this type of narrative, watch ""Godzilla X Mechagodzilla: Tokyo S.O.S."". The second big problem with ""Into Darkness"" is that it is premature. Clearly, it was intended to be the ""Empire Strikes Back"" in its own line, with everyone thrown into a desperate hour. But we haven't become sufficiently familiar with this group for such an event to have weight, nor is anyone's personal journey taken in a direction of particular interest (success in the latter is one of the reasons ""The Dark Knight"" and ""Spider-Man 2"" are excellent sequels). The lack of scope, an established threat and sense of consequences doesn't help. All things considered, the affair has all the symptoms of acting significant when it clearly isn't. The promising ending didn't necessitate anything that preceded it. It's a shame that all the focus on the stagnant story detracts from the cast of characters. As was the case in the previous movie, Kirk and Spock receive the lion's share of attention; no other member of the crew ever amounts to more than a prop for the story. Unfortunately, some of this is rushed in context, adding to the premature or hollow feel. Kirk temporarily loses command of his ship even though we've hardly witnessed his exploits as captain, Scotty's dismissal is virtually impossible to care about for similar reasons, while Pike's death, though well shot and acted, comes too early into the proceedings. Spock's concerns with fear and death are criminally underutilized, and one of the few elements that carry over from the previous movie. Benedict Cumberbatch is the sole standout as this timeline's version of Khan, and the only true reason to watch the movie; the confrontations between him and Spock are intense and vastly more interesting than those between the former and Kirk. As with its predecessor, the style favors action over protracted philosophical commentaries. But, as has been made very clear before, the Star Trek franchise does not lend itself very well to this sort of thing (and I'm sick of those phasers). Too much of the running length concerns multiple parties talking each other down, sizing each other up or SLOWLY progressing towards critical points with minimal payoff. The abundance of scenes within the Enterprise grow stale very quickly, and those lens flares reach a new level of irritating. Subtitling the movie ""Into Darkness"" was very deliberate, since there is an exorbitant amount of shaded scenes, but this makes everything less pleasant to look at rather than infusing them with a somber quality; just another example of trying too hard for a dark tone. The best fight in the movie is Khan's ground skirmish with a bunch of Klingons, which, in addition to boasting several unique weapons, is a good mix of armed and unarmed combat. For all these issues, I cannot in good conscience label ""Into Darkness"" a bad movie. The acting remains above par for a blockbuster and there are a few moments of genuine poignancy. But with a story too small for a feature length film, it's more a random chapter than a significant leap forward, not exactly the best way to further the reinvigoration of a venerated franchise.",Star Trek Into Darkness
217,caseynicholson,An Extremely Strong Sequel for This Franchise Reboot,9,6 August 2016,"The 2009 reboot of the ""Star Trek"" franchise is one of my favorite movies, and probably my favorite rendition of all things Star Trek. This film, 2013's ""Into Darkness"" is a similarly strong film, and one that continues to impress. Director J.J. Abrams shines on both of these amazing films, turning out a quality movie in both cases.Whereas the first of the series provided an origin story for the franchises's familiar characters, ""Into Darkness"" tells a complex tale of treachery and intergalactic terrorism, and introduces one of the franchise's most notorious villains, Kahn. That character, played by Benedict Cumberbatch, receives a somewhat detailed origin story, and provides for a thoroughly entertaining antagonist for the crew of the Starship Enterprise. I've given this film 9/10 stars, whereas I gave its predecessor 10/10. Like the first movie, ""Into Darkness"" continues in the line of thoroughly entertaining ""Star Trek"" movies, and this one is good enough that I toyed with giving it ten stars--but I decided to take a star away based purely on the fact that I find the first movie to simply be more likable overall, and therefore better than the sequel. Still, there's very little not to like about ""Into Darkness"". If you haven't seen the first in the series, definitely watch it first, and then check out this movie. You should love it!",Star Trek Into Darkness
218,cdjh-81125,The Greatest of The Star Trek Franchise,10,27 October 2016,Star Trek is one of the most beloved franchises of all time yet the rebooted trilogy are easily the series most divisive instalments. But this film and the 2009 original made me the Star Trek fan that I am today and this is in my (unpopular) opinion the franchises greatest instalment. The new cast of these films fit right into there roles and I could not imagine better replacements for some of the best cast characters of all time. Chris Pine really impressed me in this film he's still very entertaining and funny but he's also really good at portraying the rage filled Kirk that begins to emerge throughout this film and is a great arc for the character that would continue to be explored in Beyond. Zachary Quinto is also fantastic he once again is amazing at conveying the inner struggles that take place in his character and when he fails to keep that hold it allows Quinto to really show is acting chops. The relationship trouble between Spock and Uhura is not some meaningless sub plot it's a fantastic way to show the progression of these characters and how their continued service and past experiences have begun to effect and change them. But my God Benedict Cumberbatch was absolutely phenomenal as the Villain in this film not only is he incredibly menacing and physically imposing but also very heartfelt when you begin to more understand his motivations. He's also got some Incrediblely terrifying scenes where you legitimately start to fear for the life of the crew because you believe that he poses a real threat to them. The special effects are of course fantastic there seamless and look nothing less than amazing. Now I know that the biggest and most common complaint about this film are the comparisons to Wrath of Khan but honestly I think it worked for this film it allows the characters to be pushed to the edge of their abilities like the cast were in WOK and it gives us another chance at seeing one of the most beloved sci-fi villains of all time played by an amazing actor. The way they set up the five year mission was perfect it feels like the cast at this point have earned it and leaves you excited to see what they'll do next. I think Star Trek Into Darkness has developed a lot of unwarranted hate I thinks it's a masterful edition to the franchise that I will always love. A+/100%,Star Trek Into Darkness
219,azanti0029,"All the ingredients were there, but it didn't totally gel - still a film worth seeing though.",7,9 June 2013,"Having heard mixed reports about the film I approached it with a worry that I was going to hate, which I was relieved to say I didn't.I liked the re-boot of the franchise, the casting is good and everyone is slipping nicely into their roles, all be it that some get to do a great deal more than others which is inevitable in a film of this type.The plot as it stands is okay. With the shadow of a war with the Klingons looming, an ex StarFleet Officer, John Harrison (The superb Benedict Cumberbatch) hatches a plot to blow up a Starfleet weapons base and then wipe out many of its key fleet Captains. Losing a friend in the process Kirk begs to stop him and so the hunt is on, but not everything is as it seems.Spoiler Alert.Up until this point, despite a rather silly but fun opening sequence the film works well. Snappy dialogue is abound, everyone looks like their having fun and your quite happy to sit back a go along for the ride. The problem here is Hollywood doesn't know when to stop. Harrison as a villain is way too one dimensional, and once revealed as Khan, he just seems to be played as pure evil, yet he has a totally justified cause in wishing to free his crew. The previous Khan, was a man scorned by Kirk, he wasn't completely evil. I am guessing this is the direction the actor was given but I think he could have been more interesting and this would have made Kirks dilemma less free of moral consequences. My other gripe is that in the time line, technology wise, we seem to be jumping around a bit. I mean the enterprise was only just commissioned last movie wasn't it? Now we have a dreadnought style vessel, just put on screen to look big and powerful, to be honest, it just looks stupid, out of place and makes any battles with it totally devoid of tension, as it seems to fire weapons like alien vessels from independence day, and not like those from a Trek movie. Having gone at such great pains to take us back to the origins and done such a good job of doing so, do we have to immediately go for bigger and bigger ships for our bad guys, and immediately resort to 'Michael Bay' style gunfire in the action sequences, which rapidly makes them very uninteresting to watch. The naval style feel of the space combat is totally loss here and makes it really boring. My ship is bigger than your ship, it can destroy you.... yes it can.... yawn.That aside, I really enjoyed the movie, it was sprinkled with great lines and jokes, the characters felt familiar, but not too familiar but I think it really should be allowed to create its own way now, and not fall back into old links from the show, sure the references should be there, but don't make it a major plot point. I didn't care that Kirk constantly ignores his orders and that the prime directive seems to exist more on paper than anything else, its fantasy after all.The ship is now starting its five year mission, this will get it away from earth and allow for some really interesting ideas for new films. Let's hope we see them.",Star Trek Into Darkness
220,craig-hopton,Mediocre I'm afraid,5,3 January 2014,"I really enjoyed the first Star Trek re-make, but I'm afraid Into Darkness didn't do it for me. It felt like just more of the same. In some senses, that's OK. The characters were played well and were completely believable as younger versions of the original Star Trek cast. And the sets and special effects were top notch. That's great.But there's so much in this movie which is second rate. The storyline is insufferably dull and predictable. The bad guy, played by Benedict Cumberbatch, isn't half as sinister as he should be. The 'love interest', if there is a love interest, in Alice Eve, barely features. And the last minute 'save the world' climax is a parody of a decent disaster movie. All in all there's too much wrong with Into Darkness and I'm afraid it ends up being rather mediocre.",Star Trek Into Darkness

It this version, although many obvious questions are raised by the plot (that many reviewers raise), and without the ending the movie would have been lost, but the ending is powerful. Additionally, although you might have seen some of this story told before, you will still be surprised and riveted emotionally, by a surprise twist to it, that helps make it better than the prior version.Let's just say, when you get to the end of the movie keep your focus on Spock.",Star Trek Into Darkness

The plot holes are horridly visible and science has been pretty much thrown out the window. These are no sci-fi movies, they are pure fantasy with spaceships. You might as well have magic and pointy eared elves...er wait...Anyway, as a stand alone movie it was OK. Lots of action, none of it believable even in its own context, and some horrendous dialog which made me want to kill both Kirk and Spock as painfully as imaginably possible. Don't get me wrong, the acting was fine, but the story was just poorly executed. I really didn't care about the character (good or evil) nor the plot. I saw Iron Man just a night ago and felt the same about that movie. They are both just hollow soulless movies with action thrown in and some big pretty girls here and there. I liked this a little more than Iron Man but not by much. I still didn't care what happens in the end nor did I care to see it. If the movie were to stop 10 minutes before the end I wouldn't have cared to watch it later and see the ending... I suppose that says everything. Rent it.",Star Trek Into Darkness

As a friend of the original series it is delightful to watch this movie when it discreetly follows the original series. Even the new Star Trek is full of action it somehow feels familiar. Humor lightens the action. Movie looks magnificent even the 3D feels a little futile. There is a lot of similarities to a original movie series. Enterprise has set beautifully and largely which allows camera to move with the action. It feels like you are really inside of a spaceship. Movie works fine with it's two hour length. It will be interesting to see what mr. Abrams do with the Star Wars. I enjoyed the whole film.",Star Trek Into Darkness

J.J. Abrahms is totally bored with this stuff. It doesn't matter that he's not a Star Trek fan, but he doesn't give two sh**s for a single character in the movie. You don't have to be a Wrath of Khan fan to see what is wrong here. In that movie the plot is simple. Kirk was revealed in the opening simulation to take short cuts, but in the end, his best friend - and later his son - paid the price for his recklessness. Kirk had to learnthere were no easy ways out. Only hard truths and impossible sacrifices. There was a justice to the arc of Kirk. Into Darkness is just a Kanye West style sample remix. It's boomy, but ain't music. Now when anybody dies in the Star Trek sequels, there's no excuse for them stealing more blood from all those torpedo tube people to keep them alive.Thank you, writers of Transformers, Damon Lindelof and that short guy who creates all those TV shows that go nowhere.",Star Trek Into Darkness

No officer would pull this kind of nonsense as seen at the beginning, and certainly not one in charge of a major ship. (Think navy - seriously, this nonsense wouldn't happen.) Also, the immature ghetto rules of expecting others to violate their oaths in order to support a lie - that's not believable. But then this is a movie by millennials who never had to deal with real world life and death stuff.And what's with the changing of klingons into what ammoints to a completely different species? (And what's with ST Discovery carrying this forward?)Whatever. If you are totally new to Star Trek and have a gang mentality, I guess this is a good film.

231,IndustriousAngel,Not really what I want from a Star Trek film,5,1 July 2013,"I saw this in 2D (my son saw it in 3D a few days earlier and said it gave him a headache with all the fast action and pans). I'm not impressed, mainly with the script. The acting is OK - Cumberbatch excellent as expected, Chris Pine and Karl Urban stand out among crew; I still don't think Zachary Quinto is the right guy for his iconic role. Production values are superb - but the story is weak, forced and full of plot holes I'll not itemise, save that the federation's transporters seems to work (or not work) less on physical principles than on script requirements. The worst thing from my POV was how much of the story depended on pure action, starting with the Bond/Indy-like intro sequence and ending with the ground/air chase on Earth. Gone are the days when Star Trek stood for a type of SF that had intellectual (I use that in a very broad sense, but there it is) appeal. And the Carol Marcus character was underused to a criminal degree, they would not have let that happen in the Original Series.In some review there was mentioned how this film with its potentially sombre tones came a little to early for the yet young crew of the Enterprise, and I tend to agree. A more light-hearted, and maybe more interesting, adventure, with less explosion-action, more inter-action and a straightforward story might have been the better choice.",Star Trek Into Darkness
232,1bilbo,CGI does not a story make,3,25 June 2014,"This plot made little sense and unlike ""The Wrath of Khan"" neither do the main characters.CGI does not a story make, if this film wasn't a part of a franchise which has devoted fans it would have passed by unnoticed.There is little attention to detail or what would really occur – especially with Kirk. When a crew member is confronted by a senior officer he does not answer back or interrupt his superior – Kirk is presented as a smart-mouth but in a real situation would have been in a glass house for 30 days for insubordination.Instead of a respectful crew this Enterprise bunch behaved like a crowd of school mates who are really good at running around shouting.It is a pity that the plug was pulled on the Enterprise series as this had real characters And genuine story lines.Sadly, it is because Star Trek has fans with the same devotion as football fans that there is little objectivity and the film company can be assured of a profit no matter what drivel it produces.",Star Trek Into Darkness
233,The_Dead_See,Completely misses the tone of the enlightened future that Roddenberry envisioned...,5,20 May 2013,"So it seems JJ Abrams has traded in too many lens flares for too many closeups. The working title of Star Trek Into Darkness could probably have been ""Chris Pine's Facial Pores"". Seriously JJ - there is such a thing as long and middle shots too you know, and what's more - if you use them - when you *do* use a closeup, it has more dramatic effect, just sayin'...Anyway, directorial style flaws aside, my big gripe with STID is that it's ""just another"" sci-fi movie. What always set Trek apart was that Roddenberry created an enlightened future, a refreshing change of pace to most sci-fi, and the conflict therefore had to come from cleverer places. But with this reboot every character is constantly bickering, I frankly left the theater with a headache as if I'd just been to a teenage kids birthday party. I can get bickering, and grit, and violence from *any* sci-fi feature, and sadly now it seems like Trek has followed suit and lost its original edge. It's not until the very final minute where a little bit of the original Trek feel is re-established, but for me that was far too little, far too late.There's some giant plot holes too, if you're actually thinking about what's going on. It seems like Abrams hoped that if he put enough glitz and dazzle on the screen, most people would entirely miss the fact that they are there. I guess his gamble was correct, since the film is currently standing at an 8.4 IMDb score.It's not all bad. Benedict Cumberbatch is an incredible, intense villain and the film is worth seeing for his performance alone. And as with the first, the rest of the cast is exceptional. There's nothing wrong with the acting, music, or look of this film... just a lot wrong with the script and the tone of the whole thing. If you're not a Star Trek fan, you'll likely enjoy it... it's big, frenetic, popcorn munching silliness. But if you are a Trek fan, particularly of the quieter explorations of the human condition that TNG did so well, then you might be pretty disappointed.",Star Trek Into Darkness
234,bgaiv,Unwatchable crap,2,30 December 2020,"I shouldn't be so harsh, I actually did watch this all the way through, but this director's style is to throw endless action at the screen while parodying the earlier material. Spock screaming ""KHAAAAAN!"" ... omg. That's JJ inadvertently making a mockery of Star Trek II because he spent five minutes trying to understand this material. I do give props to Paramount for chucking this horrible un-Roddenberry crap faux storyline.It was quite cute how JJ lied for years and made the whole cast lie about who this mysterious George Harrison character was. I, like 95% of Trek fans, guessed in 2 seconds it was KHAAAN.We could live with that, but JJ wasted a huge opportunity- considering the third party here (Admiral Marcus), they had a wonderful chance to have Kirk and Khan work together. And they did that- for all of about two minutes.And in a clear demonstration that JJ thinks Trek viewers are idiots, he has young Spock call old Spock (while on the bridge, no less) to ask about Khan, and of course Old Spock tells young Spock that, oh yes, Khan is pure evil. Except, uh, the original Khan had history with original Kirk and company, and quite a personal motive.JJ made a clueless parody of Trek, about like a 2 year old throwing crayons and poop at a screen.JJ is literally the only director I have on my ""never watch"" list.",Star Trek Into Darkness
235,patsworld,Into The Darkness Soars Into Excellence!,9,25 May 2013,"I am amazed and surprised at how much I like this new series of Star Trek. I was an enormous fan of the original Star Trek. Didn't care at all for the Second Generation stuff. But this set? Wow! I liked the first one in 2009 but I really like this second one – Into the Darkness. Who would have thought they could possibly come up with a set of actors who resemble the original crew enough to satisfy us die-hard fans and yet who impart their own take on the characters? Chris Pine has the charm, audacity, and humor that William Shatner displayed – and yet there is that fresh difference. Zachary Quinto cast as Spock was a brilliant decision. He is amazing. Karl Urban as Bones, is excellent. His, ""Damn it, I'm a doctor, not a ."" is enough to get a great laugh from the audience. Simon Pegg as Scotty couldn't be better and John Cho as Sula is perfection. In this film, Benedict Cumbatch as Kahn was also a fantastic bit of casting. Well, I could go on. The casting, directing – everything was terrific. All in all, I'd say this is one fine movie. Plenty of action and enough small tie-ins from the original Star Trek showing up to thrill all of us Star Trek fans. Just a whole lot of action and fun. Don't miss this one. It's great!",Star Trek Into Darkness
236,EmmaDinkins,Chix Chat on Film review: Keep on Trekking baby,10,19 May 2013,"This second film in the reimagined Star Trek movie franchise has everything that a Trekker could ever want and more. For someone like me who grew up with the original television series and then went where no (wo)man has gone before with the feature films, I never expected that the stories would evolve into something with such 'wow' factor as J.J. Abrams and team have crafted. Once again my assertion that Mr. Abrams is my favorite and the best contemporary director has been proved to be well deserved. But he obviously has a deep insight into how to translate the dialogue from Orci and Denioff into a spectacular vision. This film has the perfect mix of action, adventure, comedy, romance, drama, and suspense. To balance out all of the emotions that were experienced in this story and create a film with an engaging plot and stunning visuals is a major feat. I was surprised to learn who the primary antagonist was, and the manner in which the story was woven around him made the story even more intriguing. I was thrilled that Uhura (Zoe Saldana) had an opportunity to really showcase her linguistics and as Catt said, it was time the Klingon's came into the picture. I've been a bit tainted when it comes to away missions because of Galaxy Quest I always consider crewman six's inevitable doom. Prior to now I did not feel as if the scale of the Enterprise or the hardware like the warp core were appropriately conveyed. Seeing the scale of engineering and the other areas of the enterprise left me awe stricken, because after all, the ship is as much a star of the franchise as the characters. My only complaint with this film was the scoring, in some of the sequences the theme music was just too over the top and made me feel like I needed to find the volume knob so that I could turn it down and refocus on the film. I get it that the music gets louder so the audience recognizes how intense the situation is, but that little trick wasn't necessary since the action scenes were full throttle and none of the excitement would have been lost if the music had been at a moderate tone. I have anxiously waited four years for this film and was utterly thrilled with the end result. I give it a green light",Star Trek Into Darkness

238,themissingpatient,Not Nearly as Bad as J.J. Abrams first Star Trek,5,31 August 2013,"J.J. Abrams returns with a sequel to his over-celebrated re-boot of the original Star Trek film series with a re-imagining of Star Trek 2: Wrath of Khan.Most audiences know J.J. Abrams as a new acclaimed film director that everybody loves and is thought of as a young Steven Spielberg. He gets credited as the creator of the hit television series Lost and the visionary director of Cloverfield, Super 8 and the man behind making Star Trek more accessible to a wider audience. Not all of this is true. Originally known as Jeffrey Abrams, he began his career as a screenwriter and producer in the early 90's. He co-wrote the James Belushi comedy Taking Care of Business and was both the writer and co-producer of the tearjerker, Regarding Henry. In 1992 he wrote and executive produced a science-fiction romantic drama, Forever Young, which starred Mel Gibson and introduced the world to Elijah Wood. Forever Young is actually quite a perfect example of Abrams writing, an ambitious story that begins quite interesting but ends horribly. The name Jeffrey Abrams died in 1997 after co-writing the embarrassingly bad comedy, Gone Fishing. The birth of J.J. Abrams came as the co-writer of Michael Bay's Armageddon. Armageddon is easily one of the most terribly written, acted and directed films ever made. This same year J.J. made the move to television, where bad writing is acceptable, with Felicity, a series he created and produced. In 2004 he created Lost, writing, directing and executive producing the pilot, which he has been reaping the benefits of ever since. In 2006 he tried returning to feature films with co-writing and directing Mission Impossible 3, only to fail horribly. He continued to have major success in television and in 2008 produced Cloverfield (not directed, produced). Cloverfield was widely popular simply because of an extremely clever marketing campaign and J.J. was again trusted in the world of film.J.J. Abrams first Star Trek film watered down the franchise by taking away the intelligence and wit it was famous for and replacing it with the non-stop action Star Wars fans crave. James Kirk was now a completely unlikeable brainless daredevil locked in an epic ego battle with a completely unrelatable version of Spock. Worse of all the film was guilty of containing the most boring villain ever put to screen. On-top of all of these atrocities, Abrams felt the need to fill every frame with annoying lens flares, constantly reminding us, as an audience, that we are only watching a film. Of course the special effects and music were as good as they got for their time, so everyone fell in-love with the film anyway.Now we have Star Trek Into Darkness. Though Into Darkness begins with an opening scene proving that Kirk has not learned anything from the events of the previous film, the visuals are stunning. Once the first scene is done with and the opening credits fade from the screen, the film actual begins to get quite interesting. We are introduced to a mysterious villain, played by Benedict Cumberbatch. Both Kirk and Spock actually mature through some much needed character development, making them both likable and relatable. While the film is still more of a battle of fists than wits, it is highly entertaining and perfectly paced with some emotional depth. Even the over-bearing lens flares die down as the film continues to get better as the tension rises higher.Star Trek Into Darkness is surprisingly a decent blockbuster with extremely high entertainment value despite a silly opening scene and a cop-out of an ending.",Star Trek Into Darkness

240,TheEtherWalk,The JJ Abrams syndrome,3,18 November 2013,"Everything this man does has the same problems. He simply has no idea how to properly tell a story. He just comes up with some ridiculously complicated plots that somehow seem to go absolutely nowhere and then simply end. He has no finesse for pacing and his obnoxious multi-million dollar CGI visual style doesn't suit Star Trek at all. I'm worried to see what he'll do with Star Wars... This movie simply has nothing going for it apart from some pretty visuals and a nicely menacing performance by Benedict Cumberbatch. Just like with Super 8, the character development sucks, the plot line is stupid and the ending just made me go ""Seriously? That's it?"" Up until that point it was okay. I liked the plot of the people in the missiles and the attack on the Klingon. It was a bit confusing but I think it made sense. However some of the techonological aspects of the film are really silly. For one thing, the Enterprise is seen taking massive amounts of damage even though the shields are still up. Scotty somehow disables their weapons from within the bowels of the ship, and not only does nobody go down there to try to turn them back on, nobody really does anything. It's a huge plot convieniency when the Enterprise is always seconds away from being annihilated, and then the enemy's weapons get disabled. This happens twice in a row. The missile detonation inside the Admiral's ship just happens to destroy their weapons. Then the whole Kirk sacrificing himself in the reactor thing was supposed to be moving but since you know he's probably going to get resurrected pretty quickly (Hint: Khan's blood can resurrect people"") there's no emotional weight to it whatsoever. Also how did the warp core get out of alignment anyways? And how did Khan's ship only start falling from the sky AFTER the Enterprise was saved? And why crash the ship and take off on foot to attack Starfleet command? (Which would have been cool but never ended up happening.) Why not crash the ship and initiate a warp core breach to destroy basically the whole city? That would have been cool. The movie should definitely have been longer and had more gravity in it's climax. Instead we get Spock chasing Khan for about 10 minutes, Uhura stuns him, and Spock somehow knocks him out with an uppercut even though he's basically invulnerable. Khan gets frozen and stowed away somewhere. Kirk gets resurrected and they fly off into space. LAME. I want to see more of Khan!!! KHAAAAAAAAAAAANNN!!!! Oh yeah that line made the reactor scene that much lamer.",Star Trek Into Darkness
241,tubby1,Master of Emotion,8,9 September 2013,"Into Darkness is a thrilling and affecting sequel. It shifts from the youthful and cheeky beginnings of the re-boot to what I consider to be a more mature and sophisticated piece of film-making. It masters the emotional turmoil, and character relationships but is less rigorous to the needs of story-telling.The shift of tone is welcome and Into Darkness moves ably through two-thirds of its running time, in an absorbing, tumultuous and thrilling cocktail of character arcs, suspense, and a non too over the top infusion of light relief. Scotty, although somewhat still an irritant, has markedly toned down his rhetoric to match the more sombre affair. In fact, Into Darkness strength is the emotional sweep of the film, the blooming relationship between Kirk and Spock the finest example.It is a shame that when Into the Darkness is at is apex of tension it fails to sure up the plot. We are left bemused as to the magnitude of Khan's potential as we are never fully appraised of Khan's pre-cryo sleep life. I am still not sure of how the 72 torpedoes came about, and how they got where they did, and why. Nor is it fully understood where Admiral Marcus's concern of all out war with the Klingon Empire manifested? Is he a military hawk out to provoke war or a man with inside knowledge only wishing to keep the peace? The introduction of Alice Eve seems forced upon us, and the Enterprise accept her presence matter of factly. We discover later that her family connections save the Enterprise from imminent destruction, this is a little too fortuitous. Lastly, and most pointedly the death of Captain Kirk, (which was highly affecting) in a sequel, seemed somewhat pretentious on the writers part. It felt like the grand end of Star Trek not the very beginnings.Into Darkness is a feast for the eyes and hugely entertaining. The emotional turmoil is engrossing and it cannot but wet your appetite for the voyages before it. Although Into Darkness fails to tie-up some loose ends it is gorgeous to watch.",Star Trek Into Darkness
242,PassPopcorn,Pass the Popcorn review,8,12 May 2013,"Four years after the successful J.J. Abrams' Star Trek reboot came out, we finally have a sequel – Star Trek Into Darkness. To be honest, I was never big on the whole Star Trek franchise, but I was rather entertained by the 2009 reboot. Combine that with the superb trailers and promotional material for the sequel, and it's safe to say my expectations for this movie were pretty high. Overall, I wasn't disappointed. Of course, the sequel had some problems here and there but, ultimately, it's on par with the 2009 movie. The only noticeable difference between these two movie is that, in the latter, J.J. Abrams significantly decreased the use of lens flares. That doesn't mean that there are none, mind you.Set some time after the events of the first movie, this one opens with Captain Kirk (Chris Pine) and his Enterprise crew, who save a planet inhabited with a somewhat primitive species from imminent destruction. This sort of interfering with life on other planets is against the Federation's regulations and Kirk must face consequences because of that. This opening isn't that vital to the whole story, but it serves as a device to further develop the already complicated relationship between Kirk and Mr. Spock (Zachary Quinto). However, what is vital to the story is that a man named John Harrison – played by Benedict Cumberbatch – decides to destroy the Federation from the inside by performing acts of terrorism. Kirk takes on a dangerous mission to go and capture Khan so they can bring him to justice.The story isn't overly complicated nor very original, but the story in this modern take on the Star Trek franchise was never the most important movie aspect. The characters were always in the first place in these two movies, and their relationships, interactions and back stories were what made my viewing experiences so enjoyable. Like I said in the previous paragraph, Stark Trek Into Darkness takes a further step in developing its characters, analyzing their complicated relationships. And that really works – the characters are likable and developed enough for the audience to care about them when they face danger. The character Khan, who is a new character, stands out the most in the movie. Benedict Cumberbatch's cold portrayal of a mad man seeking revenge is top notch. It's important to say that Khan is a much better villain than the Romulan guy Nero in the first movie. Unfortunately, some of the plot points regarding characters didn't really lead anywhere and felt useless – especially the ones with Alice Eve's character Dr. Carol Marcus, whose famous underwear scene was nothing more than pathetic fan service. Also, towards the third act, there was something we may call – a sudden new villain introduction. That's another thing that didn't serve any real purpose, but, due to its short length, it didn't particularly affect my opinion of the movie.Besides the story, which is fairly simple but strong enough, and the characters, most of which are well written and excellently portrayed, there isn't much more in Star Trek Into Darkness. Of course, there are the visuals, which are – just like in every modern Sci-Fi movie – amazing. This time you'll even see some scenes on the Klingon homeworld of Kronos, that was visually interesting. There aren't any other popular alien races shown in the movie. There is the primitive alien race shown at the very beginning, and there are numerous 'cameos' of alien races on the Enterprise. I liked these cameos since they don't take much of the movie's screen time and still effectively illustrate the Federation and the Enterprise as a futuristic multiracial society. As far as modern Sci-Fi movies go, Star Trek Into Darkness will surely leave you thoroughly entertained. Considering what J.J. Abrams has done with this franchise so far, I think the future Star Wars movies and the possible Star Trek sequels are in good hands.Rating: 8/10 Read more at http://passpopcorn.wordpress.com/",Star Trek Into Darkness
243,caseymoviemania,Casey's Movie Mania: STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS (2013),10,11 May 2013,"Brimming with enough excitement, wit and engaging character-driven drama, STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS is a summer-movie masterpiece and one of the best sequels ever made in recent years.J.J Abrams' 2009 reboot had certainly gave a much-needed boost to a brand new STAR TREK franchise. Even though that movie was flawed, it had its genuine moments. But now J.J. Abrams and his returning crew have outdone themselves with a much-improved sequel of STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS.Roberto Orci, Alex Kurtzman and Damon Lindelof's screenplay with the recurring theme of friendship, responsibility and unity is as vibrant as ever. Its well-paced structure is a breathlessly cinematic experience from start till finish. Characters development are ace and all the returning cast are pitch-perfect, especially the striking friendship between Chris Pine's Kirk and Zachary Quinto's Spock. Up-and-coming Benedict Cumberbatch gives one of the most memorable screen villains in recent memory as the mysterious John Harrison. He's certainly a great actor to look out for in the future, with his hypnotic screen presence and terrific speech pattern that reminds me of the great Alan Rickman (best known for his Snape role in HARRY POTTER series and as Hans Gruber in DIE HARD). Action sequences are significantly improved from the first movie as they are more coherent and genuinely entertaining. J.J. Abrams' direction is meticulous as he makes every frame counts.http://caseymoviemania.blogspot.com",Star Trek Into Darkness

So the only things in common with the original are the names and characters; nothing about the script belongs to Star trek. Actually the characters like the Doctor and captain Kirk look more like cartoonish versions. Star trek is not an action story ""per se"" is more in the psychological human factors hand on hand with the advances of the technologies and the curiosity of what could be up there in the outer space saga. Sharing and learn stuff with other civilizations. In this episode is all about militarization, cold war; egotists, explosions and fist fights! lots of them! Incredible. The reactions of the characters are too simple and basic human responses. Kirk acts as a silly teenager couple of times.. Also the approach is ""too North American"" too ""gringo"" A very ugly San Francisco by the way. Could be choose to recreate a new city..-Remember the big notice and commotion about the NY twin towers incident well, here you ll see half of S Francisco smashed by a giant space ship with thousands or millions of people dying and immersed in the ultimate horror in a devastated city...or dozens of the crew members (of course NEVER EVER an important character) dying in the outer space flying away from the Enterprise...nothing of that seem important; material that you can make several stories and movies about it but all was taken SO light.The special effects are OK, so there s no over use or abuse of its. The Enterprise inside etc looks pretty good. The customs are pretty good. The pace of the movie is right regarding an action movie. The main actor does not look right for the kirk character is for me like this actor that does the character of James Bond in the lasts 007 movies.",Star Trek Into Darkness

246,rebecca-ry,Great Follow-Up,5,23 May 2013,"'Star Trek: Into Darkness' is the follow-up to J.J. Abrams' 'Star Trek' in 2009. It follows the crew as they face a deadly ex-member of their own organisation who is out for vengeance.The story isn't very different from the previous instalment; the relationship between Spock and Kirk is slightly different and of course there is a different villain. The dialogue between the characters was a lot better in this film however, it was very funny but it was also very dark as well.The darkness is brought by Benedict Cumberbatch with a creepy voice and outbursts of extreme violence – all of this hidden under a façade of courteous English manners. He definitely steals the show here and it would be great to see more of him in sequels. Chris Pine, Zachary Quinto and Simon Pegg are all back and do a great job here; they all work really well together.Like the first one, the film works for both fans of 'Star Trek' and those who have never seen it – there's lots of little references to the series and films and a few major ones as well that fans will enjoy. Aside from this, there is a great amount of action, great funny scenes and this film is very entertaining overall ease up on those lens flares though, they make some of the action scenes a bit difficult to follow.",Star Trek Into Darkness
247,goolizap,Twizard Rating: 99,10,3 August 2016,"The fact that it doesn't have the unique reboot premise of its predecessor almost alone makes Star Trek Into Darkness just as impressive.It doesn't have time travel, but it does have ridiculously awesome action sequences and a lot of jaw dropping visuals.This time around, Captain Kirk, Spock, and the crew must face the killing machine, Khan, played by the always-macabre, Benedict Cumberbatch.What's at stake here may not be as catastrophic as the 2009 film either, but you wouldn't know otherwise. It provides an interesting and detailed story without a complicated or convoluted narrative--sucking us right in.The jokes are kept appropriate to the situations. They're never forced or too comic-booky. The film is fun without ever resorting to silliness, which is common among this reboot franchise. It tends to avoid the Avengers route. The quips are delivered with conviction and the banter usually comes from a place of stress, providing just the right amount of levity.2009's Star Trek mostly blind-sided us. Fanboys were shocked at how awesome it was, and non-fans were surprised at how much they loved it. This one didn't have as much to prove, but it delivered regardless, giving us 132 minutes of gripping story, compelling characters, and near-perfect pacing. I'd say it did just fine.Twizard Rating: 99",Star Trek Into Darkness
248,drew_atreides,One heck of a ride!,9,21 May 2013,"..just got back from seeing Star Trek: Into Darkness in IMAX 3D (which, by the way, this movie is TOTALLY worth seeing in true IMAX 3D. Really gorgeous to look at.)I was a big fan of JJ Abrams first Star Trek flick, and went into this one as my most eagerly anticipated film of the summer. I am so gosh- darned happy to report that it did NOT disappoint. In fact it nearly shattered all of my expectations.The crew of the first film is back and in fine form. Tremendous chemistry and witty banter abound in the midst of chaotic action. The stand-outs here are Chris Pine's Kirk, Zach Quinto's Spock and Simon Pegg's Scotty. The burgeoning friendship of Spock and Kirk is on display here with more intensity and sincerity then i think has ever been shown before in any version of Trek. And I would be remiss if I did not mention the incredible performance from Benedict Cumberbatch. His villain (or...is he?) was just tremendous fun to watch. The plot has more plot twists then you can shake a stick at, and I must say this movie went places i never expected it too. My only real complaint is the predictability of the final act. Once we started paying homage to a certain-previous Trek film it became painfully obvious where it was headed. But the first 3/4's of this flick are a real solid and keep you guessing.So far this is the best film of the Summer.",Star Trek Into Darkness
249,raphaklopper,"""Into Darkness"" is the Dark Knight of Star Trek and Abrams the young American Nolan!",9,16 June 2013,"After the great success of critics and winning the love of thousands of fans that was the ""Star Trek"" from J.J. Abrams, a sequel was promised. Usually when a sequel to a blockbuster don't usually work well, being simply being horrible or don't even reach the foots, as the first one. But J.J. Abrams hits his hand on the table and imposes its place in management and his great talent as a director and doing a FANTASTIC work.""Into Darkness"" is another proof that a sequel can be gigantic while overcoming the predecessor in many details. Without belittling the first one that is fantastic but ""Into Darkness"" is also very different from the first but keeps the same pace of entertainment and loyalty to the original saga.The story begins a year after the events of the first movie with Kirk (Chris Pine) and Spock (Zachary Quinto) along-side with the crew of the Enterprise (with all the cast from the first film) continue on their missions throughout the galaxy to do justice find uninhabited planets. After a ""successful"" mission all are called back home where they are faced with an enormous terror taking place on all the cities of their world due to several terrorist attacks within the organization. Now Kirk and the Enterprise crew embark on a manhunt after the unknown terrorist (Benedict Cumberbatch) who seems to be a renegade from the organization. A mission that will take them to a desolate planet where war reigns, behind one man's weapon of mass destruction, a mission where Kirk and Spock will meet all their worst fears and danger plaguing closely to them and their only family, the crew.The story follows a different rhythm from the first film that was part remake and part prequel, ""Into Darkness"" it also is but also carries the job of a sequel, but nothing is lost. While the film keeps very loyal to the first one, it also remains faithful to the original saga and thanks to the screenplay really well written and structured by Roberto Orci, Alex Kurtzman and Damon Lindelof that manages to carry with it many influences from the old movies (scenes and even dialogs) mixing everything with a simply brilliant originality.Not only overcomes the first one on writing, but also the direction of Abrams also improves in many details. Keeping the same of pace entertainment and giving superb action sequences also bringing the franchise to a whole new level. Everything in the film looks bigger, since the gigantic scenarios shot in the greatest perfection and reality giving a rate of galactic adventure and action.The cast also excels all greatly improved in their performances and their characters explored more. Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto continues to deliver a incredible chemistry in their characters further deepening the friendship of Kirk and Spock with superb performances. But the performance that surprised everyone and even more his character was Benedict Cumberbatch and his villain.... (I can't mention the name without spoilers) with a fantastic performance, superbly embodying his character showing cruelty and intelligence, someone not to be overestimated. And once again overcoming the first one that didn't have a strong villain as as Cumberbatch.In my opinion ""Into Darkness"" overcame the 1st fantastically, all thanks to stunning visual effects; superb writing and direction; a good pace of time with snapping breathtaking action sequences along-side with fantastic performances. ""Into Darkness"" not only can be one of the best works of the ""Star Trek's saga"" but also be one of the best sequels and sci-fis ever made.",Star Trek Into Darkness
250,Caps Fan,Not really a Star Trek film,6,11 May 2013,"As a Star Trek fan of long standing, I went to see the 2009 reboot of the film franchise with some trepidation. But in fact I thoroughly enjoyed it, partly because it held a surprise and had the guts to stick with it.And so, to this year's effort. There are many things to like about it. The performances are mostly good. Benedict Cumberbatch is a striking villain, while Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto do a good job of the reversed Spock/Kirk death scene. It is not slow or boring, and the script has some fun moments.Special effects were good, but that's a given these days. I saw it in 3D, but that didn't seem to add much.I don't remember much about the music, so it was presumably neither good nor bad.But the film just isn't Star Trek, when all is said and done. It is, rather, an action film a la Total Recall with some Star Trek characters and overtones bolted on. It would have been just as possible to make this film with a wholly non-ST cast and a different spaceship.I enjoyed it on that action-film level, but, as a Star Trek film, it is a disappointment.

Too bad JJ decided to rip off the entire plot of Wrath of Khan, because the terrorist manhunt theme during the first hour was actually kind of fascinating. What would happen if there was a terrorist in the peaceful Federation? Interesting thing to think about. But instead JJ lapses back in his whole plot-hole logic and creative bankruptcy, and even though the results are not as egregious as his Star Wars movies, it's really too bad. This movie looks like a billion dollars, the cast is actually quite good, and you can feel JJ straining to make a Klingon war. He really shouldn't have jumped ship. It just made everything worse for him.",Star Trek Into Darkness

All the dates are in May of 13 so I'm not sure how that plays out. I'm guessing that many of those who were really blown away by the movie saw it in a theater where they really got into the special effects, where maybe the others were watching it a home like I did and wasn't so dazzled by the effects.....Where the movie has to stand on it's over all merit. In that case it really does come up short. In that case it comes across as a poor attempt, and often a bit silly because there's not much meat on the bone without the special effects.",Star Trek Into Darkness

Just about sums it up for me. Just another Sci-Fi movie, not a Star Trek movie. I hope Mr. Abrams got his money's worth. Not many true Trekkies did. So many copies of scenes from other movies... just made me want to see the original movies again, because everything was better - the scripts, the acting, the logic of the plot.I can't stop thinking about Cap'n Kirk trying to climb up to the warp core to kick it into place... It was such a struggle dragging his poor old body up to the warp core... oh! hang on a minute! Wasn't the Enterprise in free fall then? With no artificial gravity working? So why wasn't he just floating his way up? Oh dear, another plot hole. Never mind. There were lots of explosions and holes being blown in the ship (as well as the plot), so I guess it was all worth watching.Well, actually it wasn't.",Star Trek Into Darkness
256,ewaf58,Enjoyable film,8,9 May 2013,Just back form the 3D presentation and I did really enjoy the film.The effects were great and the acting very good although I wish some of the 'original' crew had been given more screen time. I have read some of the Luke warm reviews and they do make some good points.My own feelings are that they should take more risks with the next film and explore the real unknown.Think Corbomite Manaeuver and The Devil in the Dark.Perhaps also the sound track could be a little quieter so we can hear what our favourite characters are saying.Do go see and enjoy.,Star Trek Into Darkness
257,ukproject,Do not call me a Trekkie,10,5 January 2019,"I'm definitely in the Star Trek camp. I not a fan of Star Wars. My favourite is still the original Wrath of Khan, I still watch repeats of any Star Trek series that appears on TV and I even like the first Star Trek movie as well as the dreaded ST Nemesis.There! Now I've got that out of the way you're probably wondering why I haven't given this movie a 1/10 rating or why I'm not trashing 'Into Darkness'.The reason being that unlike most hard core Trekkies I am not a total moron. If you simply can't enjoy a movie for what it is and end up crying all over your Star Trek posters in your bedroom while wailing 'Roddenberry must be turning in his grave', you need to get a life.ST Into Darkness has action, humour, and above all the chemistry that existed between characters of the original series. Yes there were some let downs, plot holes etc, but in no way does this movie deserve a 1/10.",Star Trek Into Darkness
258,cattjones,Live Long and Prosper J.J.,9,17 May 2013,"J. J. Abrams must go to a lot of Star Trek conventions; either that or he has a library full of the original series and films. He really hit it out of the park (or out of this world) with this installation of the franchise. I see a lot more of this series in his future and the possibilities are endless. I like this film because it has a lot of action and the story is told very well; but more than that I also like the fact that this film was also about the relationships between the crew. Also, after the first film I was asking myself where the heck are the Klingons? Well, lo and behold they finally make an appearance in this film. There has always been that tension between the Federation and the Klingons so I am glad that they got that storyline started. Chris Pines (James Kirk) is evolving more and more into the William Shatner Kirk of the 60s. He is even starting to look like him a little (although Shatner was not as emotional as this upgraded version). Zachary Quinto (Spock) is as logical as ever, but in this film he even manages to rationalize how he processes his emotion (which I found quite interesting and profound). Zoe Saldana (Uhura) gets to display a more sensitive side and reacts to situations the way that most of us (women) would with our significant other. Once again (as in the 1st film) my favorite portrayal was done by Simon Pegg (Scotty). He was most definitely the comic relief that kept this film balanced. As for Benedict Cumberbatch (Khan), you really didn't know if he was a good guy or bad guy until Spock Prime shows up and gives the crew the down low. Of course being a Trekkie, I knew he was bad, but new comers will not know. The addition of Alice Eve (Carol) to the crew will no doubt create some interesting story lines going forward. I saw this film in 3D and there were a few things that jumped out at you, but all in all I think you should save the extra dollars. I think that you will be just as impressed without the 3D effects. This film was pretty long, but I did not notice because it was so well paced. This film is definitely one that you have to see on the big screen. Live long and prosper!!! I give this film a glaring green light.",Star Trek Into Darkness
259,marthawilcox1831,Noel Clarke in Hollywood,2,28 February 2014,"Someone must like Noel Clarke to put him in this film because it was a nothing cameo part that added nothing to the film. Benedict Cumberbatch's performance was good. Simon Pegg is well cast as Scotty. The Thandie Newton lookalike (Zoe Saldana) as Uhura was visually interesting, but I didn't believe she was in love with Spock. Surely Uhura kissed Captain Kirk in the original series? Alice Eve's character, Carol, looks like Sally Kellermann's character in an episode from the original series titled 'Where No Man Has Gone Before'. The scene where she is undressing is good, but maybe there should have been more romantic interest. John Cho's performance was uninspired and the dialogue is tacky. The film is dull as a whole, but there are some good performances to showcase talent.",Star Trek Into Darkness
260,TheGreatMarkukini,What happens when a superb dish is served with a delay,7,27 February 2020,"Following the amazing start the second chapter took its time to appear before our eyes. Four years is quite a gap that needs to be justified by something very good or was it just a masterful plan to make us forget how great was the first movie?Such a long break might imply the change of the cast, however, we are lucky to have every familiar face back with some pleasant additions on top of that. I say 'pleasant' because somehow I cannot figure out my feelings towards Benedict Cumberbatch. No doubt he is a fascinating actor, although there is a subtle repetitiveness in his behavior each and every time he takes a role.Anyhow, the plot is not letting us down. The scale grows, more and more undiscovered locations, species and dangers come up on the radar. Bulldozing through extremes the team leave you no choice but gasp at new trick they have stored up their sleeves.It is fascinating how close you begin to follow every member of U.S.S. enterprise. The levels of empathy are just hitting the ceiling. A slightest worry on the screen doubles at your side. Same happens to the team that became as close as friends can get.I can say that the sequel did good comparing to the first part, but four years of waiting might have built a bit of expectations. Together with a bunch of stupid moments it slightly damages the impression still leaving cool memories.",Star Trek Into Darkness
261,jdhb-768-61234,A pile of tripe.,1,15 July 2018,"As a long standing fan of 'Star Trek' I've watched it develop and change over the years but 'Star Trek : Into Darkness' is by far the worst of the genre.This film has nothing of the original Star Trek left. There is none of the moral compass and none of the humour; in fact, there is very little of anything except noise, flashing images, shouting, more noise, impossible 'action', more noise and a quite incomprehensible story line. The characters are paper thin, the acting non-existent and the dialogue nearly so; all has been sacrificed on the altar of cgi, no doubt in order to attract modern audiences who seem to prefer the never-ending 'crash bank wallop' that this allows to anything which is remotely realistic. Kirk, Spock and the rest rush around doing who-knows-what and the whole thing adds up to a pile of nonsensical tripe. Benedict Cumberbatch resurrected as the great villain Khan is a joke; the gung-ho behaviour of Kirk, and even Spock, betrays their original characters and Simon Pegg's Scotty defies description. There is no subtlety, only brashness and violence. I repeat - this is tripe.",Star Trek Into Darkness
262,eve_dolluk,Its a reboot/remake,8,9 May 2013,"I really enjoyed the first Star Trek reboot, the entire time travel thing changing the course of history makes it easy to start a new story and keep the Trekkies happy. I must admit I have never really been a trekkie but I did enjoy the original show and the next generation series but didn't really watch the others so much. The prior Films were hit and miss, some were good and some were average and others were just dull. One of the original films I did like however was the Wrath of Khan and this film is a new way of introducing that character. The plot is pretty solid with some twists along the way but is easy to understand so it makes a great popcorn flick without just being all action and no story. Pine makes a great Kirk, hot headed and a ladies man which is exactly how I remember the original Kirk played by Shatner, Zachary Quinto makes a great Spock also and it is he that takes on board much of the action in this film. Scotty played by Simon Pegg once again provides the obviously funny moments but some of the funniest moments do actually involve Pine. There is some good comedy dialogue in the film as well as parts that reveal the characters a little deeper but mainly the main characters as we find out little about Checkov and Sulu in terms of back story or character although they do feature in the film a decent amount. Now if you are not a Star Trek fan or familiar with the original films then it doesn't matter at all but if you are then you will enjoy the references to the earlier films and series, some are very obvious and some are very subtle but they generally make you chuckle. The FX were excellent and we get some great shots of the Enterprise throughout the film as well as Earth in its future state and a brand new spacecraft that looks cool. The open world scenes are often breathtaking on Earth and on other Planets which always makes for a visual treat. There were a few moments that for me were not executed as well as they should have been when certain grandiose speeches were a bit out of sorts but none of them came from Cumberbatch, he was flawless in his delivery and execution and portrayed the villain to perfection always cold but you never knew if you could trust him. Pine when needed also has some great moments but most of his parts are on the cheesy side and at times he still looks like he is settling into the role of captain and you often think there are better people for the job but his actions and bravery have got him to the top rather than his merits or intelligence as sometimes he comes across as a bit dumb.Alice Eve is a new character ( I am not sure for how long ) who plays Dr Marcus and she adds a new female element but is mainly there for plot purposes I think. Peter Weller also comes in as and Admiral of Star Fleet and he did a good job on the whole but for me there was a part of the film where it came across a bit hammy and it let the scene down for me but he plays a small part generally. Karl Urban has little to do here except be Bones, he again hams it up but for all the right reasons and is often hilarious without saying anything particularly funny but that may be only if you are fluent with the original Bones. Overall it was a good experience and I am already wanting to find out what the crew of the Enterprise will be up to in the next instalment, its a space action/drama at its finest without being too serious or intense, it may not be meaty enough for the major Sci Fi fans out there ( and I am one of them ) but there is still enough to keep most people happy. 8/10 from me which I think is the same as I gave the previous film. I will definitely watch this film again in the future, maybe even on Imax 3D next week as I only watched the 2D tonight.",Star Trek Into Darkness
263,scott-sw,Great Star Trek Movie,9,5 January 2014,"While the previous Star Trek gave the franchise a desperately needed shot of adrenaline, Star Trek Into Darkness resurrects the franchise into full force. Kirk and Spock are on a planet where they must save the alien race from certain doom. Both violate the prime directive so many times, it is enough for Pike to yank both of them off the Enterprise, or at least out of the captain's chair. Then, things turn dark. A mysterious federation officer has staged a terrorist act against the Federation. Kirk's job now is to track down this man and kill him under the order of Admiral Marcus. Kirk, though, captures the fugitive and discovers his secret: he is Kahn, a ruthless 21st century genetically altered human. He wants Marcus killed for a sinister betrayal. Ironically, Kirk cannot trust either Marcus or Kahn. This movie has a few strikes against it. The idea of reusing Kahn for a nemesis was a good idea, but terribly marketed. Abrams denied it was Kahn for a long time. However, that is marketing. The cinematic problem was a movie a bit too long, and one that desperately wanted to play homage to the original Star Trek Kahn movie. I laughed at Spock's ""Kaaaaaaaahhhhhhhn."" It was forced and downright stupid. Finally, because of this plot piece, it drags the movie out a little too long. Another gripe is that, just like the previous installment, Dr. McCoy is not used well. My biggest issue was that JJ. Abrams makes the galaxy much smaller with the warp drive - which makes planets that should be days or possibly weeks away a mere three or four hour jaunt. Adding to that silliness was the new transporter technology makes it capable to beam hundreds or thousands of light-years across the galaxy. On the other hand, it has a lot going for it. The Kirk/Spock relationship is the core of the movie. The characters also have to learn and grow. Scotty becomes alienated because of the secrecy and sinister nature of the assignment. The space battles are epic, and we get something we have always wanted to see: a star ship falling through the atmosphere. This is a good movie providing some good, epic, battles and stories for a new generation of Star Trek fans to enjoy.",Star Trek Into Darkness
264,drawlife,Did anyone actually think Cumberbatch wasn't the villain we all guessed it'd be?,9,17 September 2014,"Even better a second time around. Let me begin by saying this film is worth seeing Benedict Cumberbatch's performance alone. As Khan, Cumberbatch is a force to be reckon with. His portrayal is just as, and might I say, in my opinion even more sinister and than Ricardo Montalban's portrayal. Cumberbatch totally holds his own, going head to toe with Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto. Unlike the first film, the villain here does not suffer from any lack of character development. In just a few dialogs delivered by Cumberbatch, we know who he is, what he wants, who he hates, and why he's doing what he's doing. All played out and executed in a short amount of time with no tedious origin story. Every time Cumberbatch is on screen he brings such a presence and a commanding force with his deep voice and his villainous aura. Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto are terrific again and their friendship are taken to the next, more complex level, rather than re-hashing their bickering in the first film. We see a natural progression of their relationship as Spock is always calculating and using logic over anything else, while Kirk does what he feels is right. It's very well displayed when Kirk saves Spock from an erupting volcano, disobeying protocol and allowing an un-advanced alien species to see a star-ship rise above the ocean. They both have a very emotional scene as Kirk sacrifices himself to revitalize the warp core of the ship. Both actors display their fine acting chops in this particular scene, that you can't help but choke up a little. The rest of cast is great as always, Saldana has an awesome moment with the Klingons speaking their language. Cho as Sulu also has a great moment on the captain's chair, Yelchin as Chekov is promoted to engineer as Scotty, portrayed by Pegg is relieved. Speaking of Simon Pegg, he does a lot more here than he did in the first film. Karl Urban again channels DeForest Kelly very well and brings out the best witty one-liners with a lot of metaphors. Peter Weller who plays Admiral Marcus, ends up being the main villain, which to me was a great surprise. It only makes Khan, in some way justifiable for his actions. Alice Eve is a welcome addition as Carol Marcus, Kirk's future love interest. This time around, there is much more tension and more escalation. Every action beat makes you tense up and anticipate the overall result. Again the visuals look great, and the warp scenes were fantastic this time around. Watching this film in IMAX 3D was visually stimulating. Gorgeously shot, and felt very grand and immersive. Star Trek Into Darkness works very well as a sequel, give credit to J.J. Abrams and the writers Kurtzman, Orci, and Lindelof, as references to Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan is present, but they are aware of the line between re-imagined homage and direct ripoff.The only problem I had with this film is that when it ends it tries to wrap everything up so quickly that the ending feels very abrupt. Nevertheless, Benedict Cumberbatch kills it as Khan, I think everyone who's seen this film can agree to that. 9.2/10",Star Trek Into Darkness
265,s_campanale,Galaxy Quest II - The Wrath of Fans,6,13 May 2013,"I am a life-long Star Trek fan. Not a ""Trekkie"", but someone who grew up with the series and later the films, both of which left a definite mark on me into maturity. The original I loved because it had wonderful characters played by wonderful actors, and clever, inventive worlds and possibilities, as well as often spine chilling horror (to a 7 yr old at least!) which still occasionally appears in my nightmares, but most of all I loved it because what was beneath all that. The use of Sci-fi to do what Swift and Voltaire, Wells and Verne, Bradbury and Clarke used it for – A Mirror to our own world in which to ask questions about ourselves and offer answers which were not always pleasant to hear. Here choices were hard, nothing was black and white and decisions and actions had tragic and emotionally crushing consequences. I remember being so moved by the series that even today I feel a lump in my throat and even a tear in the eye whenever I hear the famous theme tune that played out the latest emotionally exhausting Star Trek into Darkness once a week.Everything must change of course, but recently we have been getting reboots which are praised as being ""brilliant reinventions"" but which are simple substitutions using established names and situations to tell pretty generic stories deprived of everything that made the originals so special. Now James Bond has become a dull manic depressive engaged in boring battles against feeble opponents and his own demons, Doctor Who has become a 45 minute parade of laser blasts and half-baked PC nonsense, and Star Trek has become a wham-bam-thank you mam testosterone filled shoot-em-up deprived of even the minimum vestige of its former self.2009's ""Star Trek"" signalled the start of the ""reinvention"" which paved the way for the new style, and in its wake there was much speculation on what the sequel would contain. ""Wrath of Khan"", number II of the original series, was used as some sort of bar on which to judge its modern counterpart. Abrams and Lindof must have been listening because they've basically fashioned their own version of the story here, knowing of course that it would be judged against the original as a result.Everyone will have to make their own mind up. Being a passionate lover of ""ST2WOK"" for a variety of reasons, many personal, I found the retake not just inferior but insulting, especially since this was ""canon"", and also cheap and unoriginal. Blowing your nose (not to mention any other bodily function) on a masterpiece doesn't improve it not make you a creative genius.The story (spoilers) happens in the ""alternate universe"" of movie 1, and here Noonan Singh Khan, Indian warlord and genetically engineered superman/war criminal from 21st century Earth and his crew are picked up years earlier by militant Starfleet Admiral Marcus (Peter Weller) who wants to use Khans military mind-set to prepare a militarised arm of Star Fleet to fend off the growing Klingon threat, only for it to backfire in his face when Khan shows his true colours. Interestingly, that colour is white, since the Indian Khan, formerly played as an Indian in the usual Latin-Desi racial pass by Mexican Ricardo Montalban, is still Indian but now played by the ultra-white Anglo Brit actor Benedict Cumberbatch. How and why is never explained. Dr Carol Marcus (Here Alice Eve), Kirk's great love and future mother of his estranged son David, is here a sexy bob haired cheerleader who strips to her underwear for the sake of publicity since it's in every trailer and advert.Khan starts out as villain, then becomes a sort of ally as Admiral Marcus suddenly becomes Dick Dastardly for the unforgivable sin of trying to make Star Fleet a credible defence against the Klingon threat (Anti-militarism is so cool you know, as well as so 2003) then Marcus becomes a goody and Khan becomes a villain again. Then there's the most idiotic thing ever, which is that Kirk virtually replays Spock's sacrifice in ST2 point for point, seemingly without irony, concluding with the mirror-imaged Radiation door scene and Spock shouting ""Khhhaaaaaan!"" into the air (Oh that is SO clever and deconstructionist!) Both ships crash into San Francisco, probably killing thousands of unacknowledged extras, followed by the new most idiotic thing ever, Rambo Spock and Khan having an endless beat down on, appropriately enough, flying garbage trucks until the inevitable happy ending occurs as ST3's rejuvenating planet gets condensed into something else that cures death. Of course when ST2 came out, NOBODY knew there was going to be a ST3 – That was the end of Spock and that's what made it so powerful. Here we know the series doesn't end this way, so it is all smoke and mirrors with an appropriate lack of stakes or real emotion. Everything stops and starts again every 35-40 minutes like most other Abrams works (MI3 and Super 8 come to mind)fashioning a loose patchwork rather than an cohesive single narrative.The opening is also quite goofy, with The Enterprise underwater (?) and a bid to stop a planet from being destroyed by its active Volcano, which leads to twin themes of Kirk defying the rules (The Kobiashi Maru mindset) and of self-sacrifice, both, like the rest of the movie, nosing back to ST2.The special effects are good, as are the designs and the 3D. Acting is OK, with everyone doing a passable imitation of the originals save Pine, who is still playing Kirk as a wild cowboy douche.Exciting and interesting enough on its own, it nonetheless grievously disrespects the original, which it blatantly hijacks for its own ends. How you will feel about this depends on how you felt about the original film and indeed the original Rodenberry incarnation.",Star Trek Into Darkness

The (Star Trek) world has moved on. Times have changed and so has Star Trek. If you want the old Star Trek starring William Shatner then watch Series one. This is the new, and as per the events of movie one, reinvented Star Trek. This movie builds on all the previous Star Trek movies, cleverly using past characters, villains and heroes. Once again, the viewer is set on a roller coaster of special effects, fight scenes and lots of things being blown up. I loved it. The writers should be awarded by the academy for firstly keeping a sequel to the same, if not a higher standard than the first, and secondly for showing so much respect for the Star Trek universe. The special effects are awesome, and for the first time in ages I just about jumped out of my skin (my 7.1 system was set at high) as i guess was meant to be the case at a certain section near the start.This is entertainment, not an exact copy of a TV series.

268,andrewmerritt-31652,"Feels like Star Trek, but doesn't.",6,8 January 2020,"Star Trek Into Darkness stars Chris Pine, Zachary Quinto, Zoe Saldana and Benedict Cumberbatch. Its also the sequel to the 2009 Star Trek and is directed by J.J. Abrams. In this sequel Kirk and his crew must face off against the evil Khan who wants to create mass destruction. Now, I'm not an avid Star Trek fan, but as for this movie, it was a hit and miss for me. This film is inspired by the original Star Trek episode ""Space Seed"", and Star Trek II Wrath of Khan. And while it had potential, it didn't have a lot to offer. Almost as if the movie was confused on whether or not to pay homage to the episode or Wrath of Khan. Its as if the script was left on the cutting room floor for so long, that it was almost forgotten and they tried to aim for an original idea for the sequel, but couldn't quite hit the target. And what J.J. Abrams did in the first Star Trek was great, but this one feels repetitive, and it doesn't have anything new to offer to the audience. And the cast from the first one, gave good performance as they did in the previous Star Trek. And they added a new female character to the Star Trek family, but I felt she was in there to look attractive, and hopped on the franchise-blockbuster-train just to earn a paycheck. But the cast member that stands out is Benedict Cumberbatch who brings a new intimidating version of Khan, that I completely forgot about the rest of the cast. So in conclusion, while I think that this may not be as good as the 2009 film, its still a entertaining sequel nonetheless.",Star Trek Into Darkness
269,Foxbarking,Star Trek Wars or Star Wars Trek?,6,23 May 2013,"I consider myself a Star Trek fan, but not as loyal as some and not as aloof as others. I enjoy the original series, Star Trek the Next Generation, Deep Space 9, all original series movies minus 1 and 5, and all the Next Generation movies other than the last. I think Voyager and Enterprise and Nemesis were terrible and I would prefer to assume they do not exist. In the spectrum of Trek fans, I am not sure where that puts me.When the 2009 Star Trek movie came out, I really had no expectations for it. It was hard to be disappointed if I did not expect much. And I did enjoy the movie, but it wasn't a Star Trek movie. It was an action film and Star Trek is not an action series. They could have changed the names of the characters and the look of the ship and it would have very little in common with the Star Trek concept.The same thing can be said for this second chapter in the Trek reboot. This movie was an interesting story, but it was not a Star Trek movie. It was an awkward action film with the names of Star Trek characters superimposed on other characters. The movie made attempts at character development, but each try came across as a cheap attempt to connect this movie with the original Star Trek universe. These attempts seemed forced.I think JJ Abrams is doing here a very similar mistake as to what George Lucas did when he made the second Star Wars trilogy. I do not want to lower the Star Wars series by referring to them only as action films. They were much more than that. Still, the action sequences and the special effects were one of the major attractions of these movies. In the second trilogy they were there, but George Lucas tried (and in my opinion failed) to integrate commentary along with action and effects. He turned an action franchise into something else.Star Trek is not a series that is reliant on special effects and actions. Yes, they play a part in the series and the movies, but they are rarely the focus. Star Trek is a character development based franchise. The main focus in the original series was Spock and Kirk. Once they graduated to the movies, the Star Trek franchise became focused on the friendship between Kirk, Spock and McCoy. The Next Generation movies focuses on the development of Picard.These new movies are not character based. Pine's Kirk is not James T. Kirk. There is no relationship between Kirk and Spock that makes sense. In the previous movie, Spock casts Kirk off into outer space and Kirk pushes him to the brink of murder. Their relationship in this movie is tense at first. In ""Wrath of Khan,"" I come to tears at the point where Spock dies every time I have seen it. When Kirk dies in the new movie, it makes no sense as to why Spock is as upset as he is. Until the moment where Kirk dies, there is not an establishment of friendship that explains how Spock could lose his cool as easily as he did. When his mom died, he had to be severely pushed into the deep end, but when a man he has known for little more than a year and never seems to get along with him dies, he loses his mind? It doesn't make sense.The other problem lies with Khan. Other than having Khan's back story, this character was not Khan. Cumberbatch's Khan lacked the depth that Ricardo Montalban's Khan had. The emotion he had for his crew did not seem genuine. He did not have any of the fire and the drive and the hatred that Montalban's Khan had. The other issue I had with the movie was the Admiral's ship. It just awkwardly appears out of nowhere even if Marcus was the head of Starfleet, he would not have had the resources to hide the construction of such a ship from the Federation.In the end, this was an enjoyable action movie. I saw it on Imax in 3D and visually, it was engrossing. But the characters lacked the soul of the original series. ""Wrath of Khan"" was a great movie because it told a story that the writers and actors wanted to tell. It is the story of a man who lives for exploration having his entire life stripped from him. Shatner's Kirk loses his command when he is promoted. He lost his son for that command. He lost his identity when he took a job that wasn't his purpose in life. And when he fights back for all of that, he loses one of his best friends. James T. Kirk is a man in ""Wrath of Khan"" who is cursed in a way that each time he gains anything, he loses something bigger in response. Khan is a man who has lost everything too. He lost 200 years of his life, he lost the world he commanded, he lost his wife and many of his people. Khan and Kirk are two men who have lost everything, and they are fighting each other to take something back. It is a basic primal struggle between two deeply passionate men.Pine's Kirk is driven by one thing in this movie: revenge because Khan is responsible for the death of Pike. Khan wants revenge on Admiral Marcus for using him. Spock wants revenge on Khan for being responsible for the death of Kirk. These characters are motivated solely by the desire for never ending vengeance. While it is a great motivator, it does not inspire love or concern for any of them. What is left is a weak action movie that should not have the name ""Star Trek"" attached to it.",Star Trek Into Darkness
270,YJLcool,A great sci-fi action adventure that shouldn't be missed!!,8,11 May 2013,"Star Trek Into Darkness is a blast to watch that's filled with spectacular visuals, fast-paced action sequences, plot twists and emotional moments. There's one particular scene between Spock and Kirk, actually brought me to tears. It's fun to watch the occasionally humorous character interactions that eventually further develops the relationships between the crew members in the film.(especially the 'logic VS impulsiveness' arguments between Spock & Kirk and Scotty as well) However, many Trekkie fans might be disappointed and possibly say it's another alternate retelling of Wrath of Khan. (the best film of the old Star Trek series) But for most casual moviegoers, it is one of the best films this year has to offer, possibly the best sci-fi action adventure of the year. Once again, it is proved that with a smart script, great actors, solid plot and good direction will certainly produce great films that exceed expectations.",Star Trek Into Darkness
271,tord-1,"Good space opera, less brilliant 3D",7,10 May 2013,"Just seen the latest Star Trek movie, which had wonderful 3D when the camera was close to the actors, combined with a lot of computer game style sequences with debris flying all over the place, not my cup of tea, and sometimes the bandwidth wasn't enough, so the picture stuttered a bit, pitifully, I'd say.The leading actors were good, very good, and the base story quite OK, the comic relief, a Scotsman called Scotty (inventive scriptwriters, eh?!), why not a Swede called Swede, or ....??? Quite a bit of the film was decidedly made to become computer game material, and a few other details, like going into warp while still in the dock (if not any longer secured to it) gives me technical headaches.Worst were the, that to me are, cinematographic errors, like showing things close to the camera, say a table in front of the camera, out of focus, as that is not how we see the world. With the help of our stereoscopic viewing, and heavy signal processing, we just don't see things in front of someone we talk to, we see them, and maybe a little of the background, but that isn't how you see a movie, no matter if it is 3D or not. So to be realistic you have to clear the foreground of out-of-focus crap.The scenes that didn't have the foreground problems worked beautifully, so why not stick to that?! Another thing: I can't honestly see any reason for all that crap (bits of spacecraft, mostly) the clever CG guys throw at the audience, ragged and out of focus, just to show we can do it. Not a way to make widely 3D accepted, I can tell you that! Quite often the foreground was 3D, and the background very much 2D, as if they ran out of money for doing believable backgrounds, and used some sprayed backgrounds. The guys behind this movie could learn a lot from 'Life of Pi'- ought to be compulsory viewing, for director and cinematographer, not the least!",Star Trek Into Darkness
272,jljacobi,"Good, but not as good as the the first",7,10 June 2013,"This is a good movie, but only because the cast have so faithfully recreated the appealing characters of the original cast. The rest of the actors also do quite well. But it gets caught up occasionally in a secondary plot and a political message and loses its focus.I also had what I like to call a ""Titanic"" moment. I know a lot of people loved that movie, but when I saw the leads dancing around in the freezing Atlantic waters which apparently had been warmed to bath temperature by flooding into the ship, any suspension of disbelief I'd had came crashing down. And that was a real event! This wasn't quite as bad, and I won't mention the STID moment that hit me like that to spoil it for anyone who reads this, but it was rather large. The science in ST is always a little fantastic, but this was sophomoric. Hint: it has to do with gravity.Also, there should be someone with a ruler ready to whack JJ on the head for the next movie and say ""You did that in the last one!"" I also missed the slightly skewed ego maniacal strut that another actor once gave a certain bad guy. Speaking of which... Any movie only needs one of those, not two.I don't want to complain too much because all in all, the movie is enjoyable. I'm not sorry I spent the money, and will definitely watch it again when it hits Blu-ray.With every movie I see, I always listen to the crowd leaving the theater to see how much they enjoyed it. They were buzzing in delight after the first one, not this one. The cast lifted this one a full two points in my opinion.",Star Trek Into Darkness

274,moviescoundrel,"Not as Dark as it Could Have Been, but a Worthy Follow-Up",8,17 May 2013,"J.J. Abrams brings a visual flair and storytelling experience not equal to most other directors. He has a forte for character development, instilling empathy for the characters, visual style, intense action scenes, suspense, etc. This style + Star Trek = Very Good Star Trek Movies. I attended a double feature so was able to watch ""Star Trek"" and then ""Star Trek Into Darkness"". When watching the first one again, I was reminded how good this movie actually is. As I said before, I've never really been a Star Trek fan, I dislike the style and shape of the Enterprise, and the phasers always looked lame to me. Those two things still being true, ""Star Trek"" is absolutely awesome, and the phasers and ship are as cool as they could ever be in this adaptation. The intro and back stories to Kirk and Spock are brilliant and I can't imagine much more of a perfect cast for the entire crew.The plot (POSSIBLE PLOT SPOILER): The Enterprise crew is on a mission to help avenge and apprehend a mysterious perpetrator who is responsible for mass casualties and damage to Starfleet.The review: The second movie doesn't start with backstories or insights to character's pasts. It starts with a bang, and we find a couple characters in a scene reminiscent of ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"". Bones (Urban) and Kirk (Pine) are outrunning a tribe of aliens after they stole something sacred from their temple to try and create a diversion so that Spock (Quinto) and company can stop a volcano from decimating the alien's homeland. After this series of events, Kirk and Spock have some relationship and personality issues to deal with such as overconfidence, friendship and other human and moral characteristics.Some acts of violence against Starfleet and some significant leaders occur next, and the perpetrator is a mystery man. The search and apprehension for this villain is the basic plot of the rest of the movie. There are some intense action sequences, some good character development, and many scenes of the crew trying to keep the Enterprise afloat as usual. Also on par as usual is Bad Robot Production's consistent rocking soundtrack/score that drives the film, even when there is no dialogue you can feel the emotion in the sound. Without giving too much away, the ending of the film has a scene with Kirk (Pine) which felt very much like the finale of ""Lost"" where Matthew Fox selflessly helps his friends, awesome on ""Lost"", awesome here as well.see full review at www.moviescoundrel.com",Star Trek Into Darkness

The characters play off each other beautifully, Burt Cumberbatch makes a great villain, the script inverts (subverts?) things in surprising & satisfying ways and there is just the right amount of sly humor to go with your popcorn.I was most surprised by how heavy & philosophical this movie got at times. Star Trek has never tried to hide its humanistic beliefs. That's what has helped make this such a viable & potent franchise over ALL of these years & virtually forced its resurrections by it fan base.

276,brent_or,"Fun Action Film, Bad Star Trek Film",4,6 December 2014,"With Star Trek Into Darkness, there is quite a divide between those who enjoy it for its entertainment value, and those who despise it for its abandonment of classic Star Trek principles. Honestly, I can relate to both camps. It simply comes down to what one values as a viewer, and it should not be difficult to understand those with opposing perspectives. That being said, when viewed as part of the Star Trek franchise, this film is very much a disappointment.What Stark Trek Into Darkness has going for it is that it is an exciting, fast-paced, visually attractive action film with a great cast. It is easy to watch and beautiful to look at. One must admit that some of the Star Trek films of the past, whatever their virtues may have been, were extremely boring. That is no longer the case, and in and of itself, the engaging style of these new films is not a bad thing. The franchise needed to be refreshed, and made more accessible to general audiences. The problem with STID is that the story itself has been give the lowest of all priorities, and that is why it is not a good Star Trek film.The opening sequence serves as a microcosm of the larger film. It is comprised of a series of narratively-nonsensical set-pieces that exist for no other reason than to look cool. And they do look cool, no argument there. But something like the Enterprise ""hiding"" underwater is just purely ludicrous. Yes, we get a fantastic visual of a starship rising from the ocean, but it makes not a lick of sense either within the science of the Star Trek universe, or within the story line at hand. Not every viewer will be bothered by such things, of course, but it should be simple enough to acknowledge the issue.From there, the story unfolds more or less accordingly, with pseudoscientific (within Star Trek) plot twists holding together a narrative that is deeply conflicted. The conflict is between the good story idea that begins with Benedict Cumberbatch's character's introduction and ends with the same character's destruction. Somewhere within the murky husk of Star Trek Into Darkness is a good film about terrorism, militarization and the end of innocence. Unfortunately, the film's defining characteristic is its ill-advised homage to a set of classic scenes from another, much better Star Trek film that was made thirty years ago.John Harrison is a good new character. The idea that he is actually Khan Noonien Singh does not make sense. It is completely contrived. However, the greater problem is the winking recycling of what is arguably the most iconic scene from the most iconic film in the franchise, Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan. From my subjective standpoint, it is offensively ill-conceived, not to mention poorly executed. A small moment in a long film, perhaps, but for this longtime Star Trek fan, an exceedingly hard pill to swallow.Again, from the perspective of someone who is simply looking for an exciting space action film, none of that may matter. There have been Star Trek films that were bad films, period. This one is not a bad film; it is just a bad Star Trek film. This franchise, as other reviewers have noted, is supposed to be about thoughtful commentary on society (which requires a well-written story) and exploration of new frontiers (which requires a plot that is not focused on making nods to the past).To suggest, as the front-page user review here in IMDb does, that one should ""ignore the critics,"" is to over-simplify the situation here. By all means, do not let anyone else's subjective opinion dampen your enjoyment of something. But by the same token, try to understand that Star Trek is a deeply meaningful thing to many people, and that this film sacrifices much of its core attributes in order to be more accessible to the average viewer.The tragedy is that there is no reason why a Star Trek film cannot be both thoughtful and exciting, well-written and visually stimulating. It simply takes the right people being involved in the production. I do not want another Star Trek Into Darkness, but neither do I want another Star Trek: Insurrection. There can be a balance, and hopefully in the future, there will be a film that finds it.",Star Trek Into Darkness

This superlative sequel proved me wrong. Kudos to the writers for a character-driven action screenplay that is laced with smart humor. Director J.J. Abrams nicely balances the action, suspense and drama without losing any steam in the middle but with regular edge-of-the-seat moments. The cast is a fine ensemble, but Chris Pine's standout performance as Captain Kirk confirms him as one of the finest actors of his generation. Also adding to the movie's attributes are the special visual effects, well-choreographed fight sequences and the sublime music score. A truly spectacular effort that exceeds expectations.",Star Trek Into Darkness
278,Dandy_Desmond,I canny handle it ...its going doon captain!,5,8 September 2013,"It seems to have polarised opinions. In one corner the Star Trek devotees who wanted a more pure Gene Roddenberry vision based on the Star Trek legacy and values and in the other corner, the teenage 100mph video game generation, senses so obliterated by technology that attention spans are severely limited, who want CGI sp*nkfests, loud, fast and violent films like Transformers & Pacific Rim.Well thats the simplified version based on Internet chatter I've read.I could not give a monkeys chuff about that. The hard truth is from a neutral perspective Star Trek Into Darkness is not very good. It started well, for half an hour or so it seemed interesting but gradually the story revealed itself to be wafer thin, then gave in to all out action and CGI set pieces and eventually refused to end. There are two main problems with this film, first of all there is too much action in it. Is that a fault? I think so as in the end character interaction, and the building up of tension is replaced by an assault of impressive computer generated explosions, lazers, lens flares, fighting, running, screaming, shouting, running, fighting, explosions..... Also it did not seem to want to end, which indicates to me the makers have really tried to throw everything but the kitchen sink at this film to really entertain. Entertain the masses that is - not the fan base. Short term the studio will think it kicks ass, however long term as a quality film its forgettable and will quickly disappear. Secondly, the whole Khan thing. I'm afraid Its been done before but better, it just didn't work and the copying of scenes and dialogue and reversing the Spock/Kirk death scene was not clever it was stupid for two reasons. 1. You know Kirk will not die - so whats the point of it? And two as they have no real relationship there is no emotion from the viewer. At this point I was really thinking just give him the damn magic blood so he can pop back to life and lets finish this turkey. What I liked about the first film was it was quite original and fresh, this isn't. I don't hate it, I just find myself sighing and shrugging my shoulders. I would file it alongside Transformers, Pacific Rim and all the other CGI heavy nonsense I will watch once and never visit again. As a little end note, Simon Pegg recently told fans who voted this the worst ever ST film to F off! Its ironic that I found Scotty in this movie to be the Jar Jar Binks type character, meaning to be comic relief but turns out plain irritating. How strange Simon does not mind ripping George Lucas apart for the Star Wars prequels but now the shoe is on the other foot he becomes a little touchy. How ironic.",Star Trek Into Darkness
279,JamesIan2021,Perfect Sci-Fi,8,14 May 2015,"Star Trek Into Darkness is contender for best film of 2013. I've got a few favourites this year: Gangster Squad, Oblivion and Hansel and Gretel Witch Hunters, and now Into Darkness is in my top favourites. I've never felt so immersed and involved in a sci-fi movie this much since last year's Total Recall, every location in space and on futuristic Earth looks real and each part of the Enterprise is convincing. The beautiful 3D gets you in on the action even more as every object shoots out at you with ferocity, the depth effects are astounding as locations disappear into the background and flakes of dust and sparks hover off the screen, this is the most active and alive 3D of the year! Chris Pine's performance is brilliant as Kirk, I once thought he was a typical actor who only did silly rom coms but damn he's good, he proves he can act in a diverse range of movies. Kirk still disobeys the rules and his ignorance costs him dearly, this is true character development, same goes to the rest of the cast who are equally gripping to watch, and best of all it's great to see every cast member get it on the action, and Saldana is back and better than before. Benedict Cumberbatch is fierce and merciless, his deep bass filled voice echoes sending chills down your spine as he utters every piece of dialogue, ""I will walk over your cold corpses, and then I will recover my crew. . .Now, shall we begin?"" I love the story, which constantly unfolds across different planets and then ends up with one of the best action packed finales since Transformers Dark of The Moon, where the Vengeance obliterates downtown San Francisco, then Khan and Spock battle it out on a hover-jet, the special effects here are utterly jaw dropping. I find this sequel far more entertaining than the first movie, don't get me wrong the first is truly amazing, but Into Darkness lives up to it's sinister title delivering moments of shocking tension and brutality alongside blistering action in stunning 3D.",Star Trek Into Darkness
280,RolloTomasi,Star Trek ripping its own self off,6,30 May 2013,"Knowing I was going to be seeing this in the near future I (re)watched Star Trek II: Wrath of Khan. Aside from the superior special effects, I can't say that Into Darkness is better.Weirdly, it's like someone took this pre-production script for Wrath of Khan, pulled out its best concepts, and cobbled it together into a different film, using some of its identical scenes, sometimes giving its same lines to different actors.What makes it weirder is that there are indications in Into Darkness that this is set in the same universe as the 6 original Star Trek films (of the 80s and 90s). If that's so, then how is the same stuff happening before it happens again? The crew of the Enterprise is doomed to repeat its own history, I guess.What Into Darkness felt like to me was a big, loud, Star Trek knock off that was kind of okay. It hits the same beats that Wrath of Khan managed to pull off so much better, somehow, in the early 80s. I guess I wanted to see a totally original Star Trek tale, not one that borrows so heavily from a previous one. J.J. Abrams leans too heavily on fan love for Wrath of Khan.Hate to say it, but thinking about it makes me want to re-watch the Star Trek tribute/parody Galaxy Quest.

The time when we are blown away by grand demonstrations of digital artists, loud and booming explosions, and silly excuses for characters and story thrown into the mix. It's a summer movie cliché; one that is fun, yet unfulfilling. You could be easily skeptical of the sequel to one of 2009's best films, Star Trek, but have no fear...JJ Abrams is back in action.Into Darkness has come early in the summer movie season, but I'm sure it is going to be a favorite pick for most movie goers and also Trek fans. For me, it's definitely going to be one of the 2013 summer blockbusters to judge all others, simply because it does nearly everything right.Returning with a phenomenal cast, Into Darkness goes for a more character driven piece this time, which succeeds in almost every way. The whole cast, from Kirk to Spock (Pine and Quinto), Scotty to Chekov (Pegg and Yelchin), I could go on and on...the whole cast rocks. Dashes of great humor and stupendous writing are the strong points here, with each and every character having their shining ""moment."" Cumberbatch, our villain this time around, is also fantastic, featuring an intense and believable performance that doesn't feel cliché or silly. Above all else one of my favorites, Scotty, gets plenty of screen time and steals the show in nearly every scene. It's only some of the newer faces on the Enterprise are simply ""there"", but it's cool to see so many different characters get a chance in the limelight. The character driven story could've fallen apart, but gladly the characters are written even better this time around and are heroes you'll want to root for.The story of Into Darkness is nothing ""new"", but it's far from boring and dull. Featuring some interesting twists and incredible action set pieces, the story told is one that could've easily been rudimentary but is instead smart and exciting. While the plot of the original is a little ""thrown in there"", the plot here is more essential to the experience, it's just a little less original. There are a couple of plot holes, mainly when getting closer to the ending, but it doesn't distract...it simply (and sadly) mars an incredible experience. The visual effects wizards that Abrams commands are also back, with some incredibly delicious results. Ships look gorgeous, phasers and guns look vibrant and cool, and the action sequences are FANTASTIC. Abrams trademark style shines here too, with some sequences that are pretty simple but are shot in such fantastically cool ways that it's impossible not to be glued to your seat. There are also some simply gorgeous shots, from great use of rack focusing and quick zooms to create a sense of realism in even the most CGI enhanced scenes. The soundtrack (composed by the wonderful Michael Giacchino) is perfect. The theme is incredible, Khan's theme is excellent, and the booming percussion will get your blood pumping. The sound effects are loud and in your face, but you also never lose the intimacy of an important dialogue moment. It's edited to perfection (in theaters).It's only a couple of plot holes and the lack of ""freshness"" that made the original so incredible that keeps Into Darkness just shy of greatness. It's the characters and thrilling story that keeps you glued to your chair, which arguably is more important and thus makes Into Darkness the superior entry in the series. As for now, Into Darkness is a truly spectacular 2nd act for the Enterprise and crew, one that takes their relationships to the breaking point and truly tests both the cast and Abrams once again to return and try top themselves once again. Into Darkness doesn't boldly go where no film has gone before, but it is surely one of the most solid sequels that Hollywood has dished out in recent memory. But I'll stand by this: What a fantastic way to begin the summer movie season.9.25/10",Star Trek Into Darkness
283,culmo80,Entertaining...but not perfect,7,21 August 2013,"The thing I didn't like about the first film (by JJ Abrams) was that I felt like I was missing out on a lot of jokes because all the Trekkies in the theater were laughing at various points of the movie that didn't seem funny at all to me. I'm not a Trekkie; I've seen the older movies and a few TV episodes, so I felt like I was witnessing a bunch of inside jokes, which seemed to be much of the first film.This time around was much better. Abrams is done introducing his version of the new universe and gets down to storytelling, albeit not as effectively as he could have done.From the original films, my favorite was Star Trek II. I loved Khan as a villain and I loved the sacrifice of Spock and I loved the space battles between the Enterprise and Reliant. So I was looking forward to this film.I wasn't sure how Khan would do, played by a scrawny British guy, but Benedict does a fine job playing a more brains vs brawn Khan. The problem with the film comes when you think about the plot too much... From the bombing in London onward, everything seems to happen simply as a plot device and without any real rationale behind it. I'm willing to believe that Khan couldn't get into the secret labs and had to coerce someone else to go in there and blow it up. But why would he personally attack the meeting and risk being killed or captured? Wouldn't history's smartest psychopath find a way to eliminate all those individuals in a more efficient way other than in a hovercar with laser cannons? Why would he teleport to the Klingon homeworld? Wouldn't he want to continue his war against Admiral Marcus...who was on earth? Again, this seemed like just a plot device so they could introduce the 72 special torpedoes and then the USS Vengeance. I was hoping for a good space battle, but you'll notice that the Enterprise fires exactly ZERO phasers or torpedoes in this film. It just gets rocked by the Vengeance. It would have been more satisfying to see the two ships duke it out.Anyway, plot holes and blatant plot devices aside, the film is good and does manage to make you care about the main characters and you do enjoy watching Khan really dominate his adversaries.I just wish Abrams was a better storeteller. So much of this film depended on convenient plot devices that really aren't explained. For instance...Marcus could have had Khan doing covert operations on the Klingon homeworld or something, which would explain why he went there. You get the idea.I also wish he would use regular filming techniques over the lens flare and the zoom-in blur effect...if I wanted to watch a home movie...I'd do just that.This is a film worth seeing and paying money for.",Star Trek Into Darkness
284,WKYanks,"JJ listened, the writers not so much",6,31 May 2013,"Seems one need qualify themselves here so here I go. I'm a 40+ year Trek fan that fell in love with the series watching reruns on our black & white TV. I've since purchased and watched everything Trek, been on multiple message boards discussing everything Trek again and again and I have worshiped at the altar of Gene Roddenberry (Vegas Star Trek Con). ""Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan"" (TWoK) has always been my favorite movie. I know my Trek as well as if not better than most.This is a difficult one, many highs and lows. I'll start with the cast. Once again this is the highlight of our new 'Trek'. Chris Pine gives his best acting performance ever. All of the actors understand their characters and work amazingly well with one another. The only question mark I might have is Alice Eve, and she hasn't been given enough yet to make a sound judgment. I do have some issues with how a couple of these characters are being written, but that's not the actors fault. Cumberbatch not being a ""man of color"" is not a problem. He played the part brilliantly. Kirks development in 2 short movies is outstanding. Peter Weller (John Frederick Paxton not Robo-Cop) is also outstanding. While I understand the need for Pike to die to aid in the development of Kirk, I'm sad to see him go. Bruce Greenwood's Pike was truly outstanding.The plot: I've read probably 100 reviews here and at Rotten Tomatoes. It's obvious to me that folks don't understand the plot (or don't want to). This is probably a result of the fast pace ""shoot'em up"" theme in the movie (which most seem to dislike). I had to see it twice to follow it, but it is there and it's strong. Only in a JJ Trek movie does the plot get criticized because it aptly addresses current political issues. In all other Trek, those episodes and movies are considered 'Trek at its finest.' The hypocrisy I read from fellow Trekkies here is disheartening. Look past all the 'window dressing' you don't like and listen to the plot. It speaks loudly concerning current drone policy, GTMO detainees, 9/11, family, the ""War on Terror"" and gives us things to contemplate which is very Trek.Now this Trekkie noticed lots to be upset about in this movie, but the plot shouldn't be one of them. The resurrection of a classic Trek character, Khan's reveal, after masquerading as John Harrison about 2/3'rds of the way through the movie, was meaningless to those unfamiliar with ""Space Seed"" and TWoK and didn't do anything for the Trekkies either - aside from getting under their skin. But OK, Khan's awakening does follow Trek canon and I'm OK with using him (now). What REALLY fires up this Trekkie was the complete lack of original thinking (writing) and using a rip- off-reversal of one of Trek's classic, revered and most iconic moments (Spock's death in TWoK). They actually thought Kirk entering the warp core, dying and saving the Enterprise and her crew was good writing e- gads oh, they also thought having Spock ""loose it"" and scream ""KHAAAAN!"" like Kirk did in TWoK was somehow in character for Spock (in either timeline). nuSpock didn't act like this when his planet was destroyed AND he lost his mother. Whatever made them think that losing his ""friend"" who he's known for about a year and who he's been at odds with for about half that time would provoke such a un-Vulcan response. Double ""e-gads"". All Harrison needed to be was an augment.Some technical Trekkie stuff that makes one slap their forehead you ask? How about Kirk speaking to Scotty in a bar light-years away from Enterprise on his communicator or Harri-Khan's briefcase sized trans- warp thingy or rocket thrusters on the bottom of 1701 or the SSN-1701 or no radiation suit in engineering or why not give Kirk some anti- radiation meds after the interior door was shut or cold fusion stopping a frakin volcano? There, now you know I'm a Trekkie. (This nit-picking has been done to every single Trek movie and episode BTW. It's a labor of love) JJ did listen to the fans. He reduced the shaky cams, lens- flares and we now have a warp core that looks like something from the future rather than a beer distillery. (Thank you.) The problem is the writers didn't listen or just don't get it. They played the standard reboot theme of taking literary license with past production to the point of ""WTF"". Spock is still Spock. Nero's incursion shouldn't change that. Uhura shouldn't change that. (Oh, if it's not painfully obvious now, the Spock/Uhura thing needs to stop.) I understand the need to give Uhura more, but please don't do it at the expense of McCoy. He's too important here. Star Trek isn't Batman, or The Hulk, or Star Wars. It's not a place to ""play"". Star Trek has always been more than those. I hope the writers for the next installment take that to heart a little more than they've shown in the first two. The crew is assembled. They've been through hell a couple times. Let's use our imagination and create something fresh and new, something we can dream about, something positive. Pop-corn block-buster with lots of action - sure. But it also has to be a ""Star Trek"" movie. Make it ""Trek"" and you will be heralded. I want to take my kids to the next movie and I want them to learn something about life without seeing someone squeeze someone's head until it bursts.How do I rate this visually epic, beautifully scored, Trek challenged movie? 6 of 10 I think. Trek is at home on TV, so this Trekkie will demonstrate some IDIC here and welcome this movie into the community.I highly recommend ""Star Trek Into Darkness"". 9/10 had they not defined plagiarism with the ending.",Star Trek Into Darkness
285,hkauteur,HK Auteur Review - Star Trek Into Darkness,9,21 May 2013,"The crew of the USS Enterprise meets an unstoppable force of terror from within Starfleet, Captain Kirk leads a manhunt to capture a one man weapon of mass destruction.The central relationship between Kirk and Spock is the most compelling element out of the entire Star Trek canon. My peers frequently debate me about Star Trek: The Next Generation but my viewing experience of TNG has only been the movies. Unfortunately I missed it as a television series. For my money, there's been nothing nearly as compelling and iconic as Kirk's hot-blooded brash instinct versus Spock's cold logic and the temperamental humane Dr. McCoy caught between them. I love what they each represent and their eternal triangular quarrel. They want to work together to solve grandiose problems but they all see different on the approach. Never does one of them ever solve the solution completely with their own philosophy and often it's a varying combination of all three that saves the day. It's about hearing people out, being unassuming and adapting to new ideas. When Star Trek: The Original Series debuted in the mid-60's, Gene Roddenberry intended the original show to have a major political agenda and aimed to present an optimistic version of what man can be at their very best.Much of the essence from Star Trek: The Original Series remains in Star Trek Into Darkness, it contains themes about colonialism, political intervention, foreign policy and terrorism. But it is there only if you want to read it. These themes are expressed in a muted fashion as the thematic discussions are always running parallel to major action set pieces. As if the material was like a shark that had to keep moving at breakneck speed or it will risk dying of boredom. Personally, I never minded those thematic discussions in the previous Star Trek films. A few more quiet moments wouldn't have been bad either. Just saying. Now that J.J. Abrams is helming the next Star Wars movie, the ""Star Wars vs. Star Trek"" geek war that existed when I was a teenager might very well be over now. A Star Wars influence is present in the film and I ponder what elements Abrams will bring over.The script is workshopped to an inch of its life. Heck, it's indicative in the film's ""no colon"" title. The fact that the writers have been quoted stating that ""There's no word that comes after the colon after Star Trek that's cool."" has been clearly spent way too much time pulling their hair psychotically, obsessing over every detail and perfecting the story over coffee-spilled paper. Seriously, is there really a group of people out there that feels negative about colons after the movie title? Does that really justify warping (yes, pun intended) English grammar? This sounds like ranting but I really mean this as a compliment to their supposed geek madness.The cast delivers as they did in the previous installment. I do think having watched the previous installment helps immensely as there are not a lot of character building moments for everybody. But the actors are all well casted in their roles and fortunately every crew member still has something to do. Zachary Quinto shines as Spock and his friendship with Chris Pine's Kirk is a believable one. Their friendship is the heart of the movie. Simon Pegg gets to do something new as Scotty. Benedict Cumberbatch is a great villain. He owns the audience. One minute he is savagely evil, the next minute we slightly sympathize with him and then he shifts again. On that note, I can't wait for Sherlock season 3.This is a very ambitious film that has a lot of things to accomplish. It's trying to deliver a story with multiple characters, please both the non-fans and the fans, go to new territory but also honor the spirit of the original series. The film essentially wants to have its cake and eat it too but it accomplishes it really well. If J.J. Abrams' gave any more pop culture nods as he does in this film, his head would fall off. I cheered at the spectacle of the action scenes, laughed at the in-jokes, and almost cried at the film's climax. It doesn't go to new territory as much as the first one and I hope they do go somewhere new for the next installment.I want to see it again and look forward to the third installment. Hopefully it won't take as long as this one.For more reviews, please visit my blog @ http://hkauteur.wordpress.com/",Star Trek Into Darkness
286,jaguiar313,"Fun and action packed sequel, though not quite trek 09",7,16 May 2013,"t's been a 4 year mission to wait for a sequel to J.J. Abrams' awesome Star Trek reboot but, finally Star Trek Into Darkness has arrived. And while it's not quite up to the 2009 blockbuster, it is still a really entertaining 2 hours at the movies. The film opens with Kirk (Chris Pine) disobeying Starfleet's Prime Directive to save a primitive alien race and his Vulcan first officer, Spock (Zachary Quinto). When the Enterprise reaches Earth, instead of being handed the much coveted 5 year mission, Kirk is handed a demotion and Pike resumes command of the good ole NCC 1701. But, this speed-bump in Kirk's career doesn't last as a mysterious rogue Starfleet agent by the name of John Harrison (Benedict Cumberbatch) launches deadly terroristic attacks against Starfleet and it's personnel. His actions put Kirk once again in the captain's chair with orders to hunt this dangerous fugitive down, on the Klingon home world of Kronos to where he's fled, and eliminate him. But, Kirk is not comfortable being an assassin and he and his and crew find that once they enter Klingon space and retrieve their quarry, that ""John Harrison"" is not who they think he is and they may be pawns in a greater conspiracy involving a Starfleet Admiral (Peter Weller) with a monstrous warship and his own agenda. Star Trek Into Darkness is a fun and fast paced action adventure that's only real problem is that it moves a little too fast and we'd like a little more time to allow the emotions of the events witnessed to resonate. Kirk's demotion is a good example as he is back in command in about 10 minutes of screen time and we really don't get a chance to appreciate this blow to the character's career and ego. Once the plot starts to unfold, the film is all too eager to get to the explosions and fisticuffs then to give us a few minutes to properly absorb the dramatic effects of what occurs. But, I would be lying if I said that what action Abrams delivers is not exciting and fun because, it is. This is especially true during an exhilarating last act which made up for some of the lack of real emotional depth earlier on. The script from Roberto Orci, Alex Kurtzman and Damon Lindelof has it weaknesses but, ultimately I did like their twist on a familiar Trek character and how the new time line effected his involvement in Trek history. The cast is once again top notch and it is the involvement between characters that really helps keep this movie on target during some of the weaker bits. The combination of Abrams' direction, the script's character interaction and the cast, really give this film it's strength despite all the awesome action and eye popping SPFX. All the crew return from Trek 09 and are all really good, once again, at making these classic characters their own yet, still familiar. Trek's bad guy is played with relish by Benedict Cumberbatch, giving a strong performance as the main villain, though I just wish his character had a bit more screen time to be developed a bit more, to really appreciate and give the character more weight. And it's great to see Peter Wellar back on the big screen as Admiral Marcus, the Starfleet officer whose visions of war with the Klingon Empire have caused him to act against the very things he seeks to defend. And pretty Alice Eve is fine as Carol Marcus, the admiral's daughter and future Kirk love interest. The character has little to do for the most part but, Eve does well when Miss Marcus does become important to the plot. So in conclusion, I had a fun time watching this Trek sequel and while I wish it had a little more emotional depth in the first two acts and a little more development of some of the new characters, their is plenty of warp speed action to entertain and the film really delivers in the final act where it counts. Beam me up for Trek 3!",Star Trek Into Darkness
287,alexcomputerkid,A very fine piece that could live on forever.,8,11 July 2013,"In 2009, J.J. Abrams made one of the biggest and riskiest moves a film director could make. He put out a reboot of a famous series with a large and loyal fan following when he made Star Trek. Surprisingly, it was an absolutely great film that earned it's money and put every actor's career who was in it on track. In a different way, a sequel was going to be more difficult to pull off. You would have to put in a new villain, put in a new plot and work with the same cast again. Well after seeing Star Trek Into Darkness, I see it as a very fine piece that could live on forever.With similar feel of the the terrorist acts which are happening in our world today, there is a bombing of a secret Section 31 installation in London. This was masterminded by former Starfleet agent John Harrison (Benedict Cumberbatch) who is on run with the Enterprise and it's crew in pursuit so to capture him.The plot seems simple but once put into the bigger picture, it is much deeper. The character, John Harrison is no doubt the main highlight of this film. His performance more than matches the villain, Nero from the 2009 movie including a great Klingon fight and he fits neatly into the Star Trek world.The third act is the most interesting part of this film. This is where everything comes together and also shows the San Fransisco of the future but it this is also where the main problem comes in. It drags and involves the death of Captain Kirk but with a plot twist on that and it seems that Abrams just didn't want to end this.The movie does have the same main cast as the previous movie. Characters are more developed with performances that fit into each character. Zoe Saldana plays Uhura and is in the first act and only in some of the second. Anton Yelchin as Checkoff is in and out of scenes. The surprise of the film is Simon Pegg as Scotty who has a larger role than the previous movie and closes the film well. The cast plays out differently than the previous movie and I think they fit into the plot well.As he does with the previous movie, Abrams nails the little points of this film. There is a new setting and the special effects are better than the last one. The costumes of each character are also pretty fun to look at and will help make the movie memorable.I don't know what is next for this series. For now, I like where this series is. I do have a lot of confidence in Abrams and would not mind maybe five more of these and I bet he could do it as he has proved himself with this film and the last one.",Star Trek Into Darkness
288,Tyson14,One of the best Star Trek movies of all time.,9,29 July 2014,"A good portion of Trekkies (or Trekkers, depending on one's level of Star Trek obsession) have special affection for episodes of the original TV series that related to Earth and other- Earth cultures visited by the crew of the Enterprise, version 1.0. Some of the shows unfolded in distorted forms of the past, some in the present day of Star Trek's future reality. Director J.J. Abrams recognised the importance of this relationship in his origin- story reboot of the franchise in 2009, and in Star Trek Into Darkness he has made it an even greater touchstone to the roots of Star Trek creator Gene Roddenberry's defining philosophy from nearly 50 years ago. The human home world is key to the plot of this spectacularly bold leap into Star Trek lore, which cleverly continues along the alternate path that was established as separate from the ""original"" Star Trek universe in Abrams's first whiz-bang crack at advancing the mythology. But it's not just Earth that is cool and imperiled in this rendering of adventure in the 23rd century; Into Darkness also plays with the original conceit that Earthlings were member to a multi-species United Federation of Planets ruled by a ""Prime Directive"" of noninterference with other civilisations. The conflict comes when rogue elements in the Earth-based Starfleet Command hunger to shift focus from peaceful exploration to militarisation, a concept that is anathema to the crew of the Enterprise and her ongoing mission. The new cast is again inventively reunited, each of them further investing their characters with traits that reveal novel acting choices while staying true to the caricatures that are ingrained in our popular culture. The interplay between Chris Pine as Kirk and Zachary Quinto as Spock is deeper, and Zoe Saldana as Uhura is a solid third in their relationship. John Cho (Sulu), Simon Pegg (Scotty), Anton Yelchin (Chekov), and Karl Urban (McCoy) all have standout roles in the overall ensemble mystique as well as the plot-heavy machinations of this incarnation's narrative. Fortunately, the burdens of the story are well served by some important additions to the cast. Benedict Cumberbatch's Shakespearean aura, ferociously imperious gaze, and graceful athleticism make him a formidable villain as the mysterious Starfleet operative John Harrison. Harrison has initiated a campaign of terror on Earth before leading the Enterprise to even greater dangers in the enemy territory of Klingon-controlled space. That his background may make dedicated Trekkies/Trekkers gasp is just one acknowledgment of the substantial and ingrained legacy Star Trek has borne. There are many references, nods and winks to those with deep reverence for the folklore (some of them perhaps a little too close to being inside- baseball), though the fantastical and continually exciting story stands as an expertly crafted tale for complete neophytes. Another new face is Peter Weller--iconically famous in sci-fi-dom as RoboCop--here playing a steely, authoritative Starfleet bigwig who may also be following a hidden agenda. Not only is he running a covert operation, he's also at the helm of a fearsome secret starship that looms over the Enterprise like a shark poised to devour its prey. Which brings us to the awesome CGI effects driving the dazzling visual style of Into Darkness and the endlessly fascinating cosmos it makes real. The wow factor extends from the opening set piece on an alien world of primitive humanoids, garish vegetation, and a roiling volcano to the finale of destruction in a future San Francisco that is elegantly outfitted with gleaming-spired skyscrapers and all manner of flying vehicles. (London also gets a breathtaking 23rd-century makeover). With a coolness that glistens in every immaculately composed shot, the movie never forgets that humanism and creativity make the myriad design details and hyper-technology pop out as much more than eye candy. The biggest achievement of Star Trek Into Darkness is that it hews to the highest standard of a highly celebrated tradition. Though Kirk and co. may bend it a little, the Prime Directive remains unbroken.",Star Trek Into Darkness
289,aldri-feb,Fully entertaining and great watching experience,8,11 May 2013,"I watched it at midnight show yesterday and didn't expect too much after seeing early rough reviews from the critics, but after the movie ended I felt nothing wrong with this and truly far from disappointment. Once again J.J.Abrams shows his directing ability and continuing to amaze audience after what he had already done in 2009 with a solid piece of work. 'Into Darkness' is one of the most entertaining and satisfying action movie I've seen this year. It's fun, thrilling and spectacular at some scenes especially last 45 minutes of the film. The acting from their three main casts (Chris Pine, Benedict Cumberbatch and Zachary Quinto) also can't be taken lightly. Especially for Zachary Quinto, his character here has a lot improvement and he has done his challenge incredible. There's no doubt about the visual, it's been outstanding and stunning, you couldn't ask more than this. The IMAX visual is also amazing and worth to see.Besides that, 'Into Darkness' has less complex story. Character of the villain is not introduced clearly and appeared too sudden. The thing is probably because 2009 'Star Trek' has already been too perfect, J.J.Abrams had made high standard in the first franchise that even himself hardly to level it. I think J.J.Abrams has pulled out all of his idea in first 'Star Trek' reboot that makes this movie not that special and feels repeatable. The storyline in 'Into Darkness' isn't as complicated as the first movie so don't worry if audiences haven't watched the previous movie, they still could enjoy this. Afterall, 'Into Darkness' is a great action package and something you shouldn't miss. It might be not as good as the first franchise but it's still one of the coolest movie you'll ever experience. It may be too early to say that it's the best summer blockbuster movie this year, but it could be the great one. I personally love 'Into Darkness' and wouldn't mind to see it again.",Star Trek Into Darkness
290,velvoofell,"Blame or Credit the ""Parallel Universe""?",6,11 May 2013,"Eric Bana's renegade, time-warping Romulan Nero has a lot to answer for. Not only, in the first film, did his 'A Sound Of Thunder' style time-messing change Kirk's physiognomy, but also that of Chekov. Brunettes became Aryan Adonises. Olive-skinned Hispanic television actors became high-cheek boned, dyed-black-redhead English TV ones.Why fuss over racial casting? Why moan over the choice of the brilliant Benedict Cumberbatch in a role he makes his own (he looks more like a 1960s TV baddie than Ricardo Montalban at any rate)?Well, Gene Roddenberry created a well-paced series with a cast whose very presence on screen broke barriers. Khan (for it is he played by Cumberbatch here) was a landmark role for Hispanic icon Ricardo Montalban and it is strange that one of his fellows was not cast here. Benicio Del Toro would have been magnificent.Why keep tribbles as lumps of faun wool when the grandeur, flawed glory and warped codes of the Klingons are dispensed with in favour of turning them into disposable LOTR orcs acting like the stormtroopers from 'Star Wars'?My rambling has a point. Abrams has all the ingredients of exciting and funny space opera yet his batch of flash-bang gumbo, with odd, sleight-of-hand emotional wringers and wiki'd-in-a-day nods to Trek-lore tastes bland compared to the sometimes cheesily overcooked banquet Roddenberry bequeathed.That Trek lore and history - even aesthetic - is so drastically altered, apparently by that attack on the Kelvin by Eric Bana all those years before - leaves less of a blank cheque to rewrite than JJ Abrams has a right to cash.An entertainingly thrilling film - but an unsettling watch all the same for anyone remotely familiar with Trek in all its TV incarnations - where diplomacy and philosophy were merely flanked - and for solid plot-motivating reasons - by phasers and torpedoes.Whatever any viewer's reaction may be, Karl Urban's uncanny channeling of DeForest Kelly is, as in the first film, worth the price of admission alone and his is the most memorable performance in the whole interstellar jambalaya.",Star Trek Into Darkness
291,DubhDoo,J.J. Abrams sets his phasers to stunning,7,14 May 2013,"In 2009, J.J. Abrams successfully reinvigorated a flailing franchise in a manner that few saw coming. 'Star Trek' was an unexpected triumph and one of the best films of 2009. However, can lighting strike twice? Well, 'Star Trek Into Darkness' is superb evidence that it can, because not only is it a great movie, but also one of those rare cases where the sequel betters the already good predecessor.The film finds Captain Kirk (Chris Pine) and the Enterprise crew begin to fracture as their most powerful enemy yet, a terrorist within Starfleet, John Harrison (Benedict Cumberbatch) declares a one-man war on the organisation. After a number of terrorist attacks, Kirk decides to embark on a manhunt to stop this ruthless villain. 'Star Trek Into Darkness' opens with a blistering action sequence that sees the Kirk and 'Bones' McCoy (Karl Urban) fleeing from a tribe of fierce natives, while Spock (Zachary Quinto) descends into an erupting volcano. Brilliantly, the pace doesn't let up, it rattles along at the speed of a freight train (or more appropriately, a starship at warp speed). If anything, this sci-fi sequel confirms J.J. Abrams as a master of pacing – no scene is too long, too short or drags in any way. The action setpieces – from a gunfight in a maze of ruins to a chase through San Francisco – are truly breathtaking.But with so much action, is much space allotted for the ensemble cast? The answer, thankfully, is yes. The Kirk/Spock dynamic (passionate hot- head and impassionate man of logic) has always been at the very core of Star Trek's appeal and here, it is at its very best. Much of this is down to top-notch performances from Pine and Quinto, who continue to work wonderfully together, and also separately. The other cast members all get their moments to shine, whether it's Scotty (Simon Pegg) drunk or Bones' cracking one liners (""Jim, you don't leave a heist when the runaway car has a flat tire!"")A shining standout though, is Benedict Cumberbatch as the villainous Harrison. In the previous Trek instalment, Eric Bana's Nero made for a solid, if unremarkable foe; however such is not the case with Harrison. Cumberbatch is a formidably intimidating villain, made all the more menacing by his cold and calculating manner along with a sense of there being method to his madness. One of the best things about 'Star Trek Into Darkness' is the perfect balance it strikes between being one for the fans and also a film that newcomers can readily enjoy. For the Trekkers, there are clever and often funny nods to the franchise (Tribbles! Gorns! Red Shirts!), but for people who've never seen anything Trek-related before, this is just as accessible – ""The aim was to make a movie that could stand on its own terms"", Abrams outlined. This is a non-stop thrill-ride of a movie with three-dimensional characters, humour, rug-pulls, heart and plenty of lens flare. This isn't just a great sequel or a great 'Star Trek' movie; this is a great movie fullstop. 'Star Wars VII' is in very safe hands indeed.",Star Trek Into Darkness
292,arnieiam,I would be lying if I told you I wasn't impressed,10,21 May 2013,"J.J. Abrams to me has now become sort of interchangeable with Joss Whedon. Both filmmakers made good television shows, wrote mediocre scripts in the 90s and now directed really good films which are immersed in fan fiction.Now I am a Star Wars fan, so I never really was into Rodenberry's... stuff. So yeah I prefer light sabers over phasers. I know bits and pieces but not anything like the Klingon language.I do know that the even numbered films are way better than their odd numbered counterparts and this still makes the case. The first film was OK, but it was mostly set up and the villain was a generic Romulan.Here the villain was, and lets be honest here they weren't fooling anyone, is Khan played by elongated faced British man. A white Khan, but nonetheless Khan. However its a more densely layered story, so there is another villain played by RoboCop who wants to start a war with the Klingons. And Iron Man 3 should take notes. What they did with the two villains was brilliant, with Khan initially forming a loose alliance with Kirk and then ascending as the main bad ass. So instead of lame cop outs, you have one take out the other and go hard.And I was completely blown away by Spock. In the third act, he actually showed emotion! And he was able to match himself mentally and physically against Khan, and I would be lying if I said that I didn't get overjoyed when he used his Vulcan death grip. But sadly he wasn't able to pull off that classic line by Shatner: ""KHAAAAAAN!"".Now this film had some things that weren't necessary. The prologue sequence didn't really drive the plot, it was meant for purely for some establishment of characters. The conclusion was also very abrupt. There was constant use of pans, Dutch angles and lens flares. And that gratuitous scene of the blonde chick in her lingerie, really? Are you that desperate to get prepubescent teens? That still is very well compensated by a really well paced film and a very great plot in which only a percent of the elements are contrived for fan pleasing. It's now guaranteed that Abrams will make an awesome Star Wars installment.",Star Trek Into Darkness
293,a_sad_cow,Give the franchise back to Frakes and Berman,7,25 September 2013,"First off, die hard fan, every episode of every series, and every movie. I was excited when Abrams got the 2009 reboot and he definitely brought some very positive things to the franchise. The cast is outstanding with most of the character development tweaks being a positive thing. The problem is being so overly focused on character development that it kills the plot. This was clearly evident in 2009 and didn't get too much better here. It certainly seemed like every time they wrote themselves into a hole, some character made a dramatic emotional plea to another character. It's a plot device severely overused in the franchise which hopefully does not appear in the 3rd movie.2 movies don't really make a trend but I have little faith a 3rd movie with Abrams directing will be a significant improvement from where we are. In order to do better, Frakes and Berman should take an already outstanding cast, set and special effects team, and give them the plot they deserve.I also sincerely hope they don't use this movie as a kill to the eugenics thread. I know it wasn't completely wrapped up but there's still plenty to explore. They only hit the tip of the iceberg in Enterprise Season 4 and there's so much to do. Mayhaps for the 4th movie in the reboot franchise? Certainly doesn't have to be the next movie, but it's a good thread to follow.I don't mean this as a slant against Abrams but he's done what he can do and, really, Star Wars needs all the love he can give. I'm still very excited for the sequel trilogy and have every confidence he will give it the majesty it deserves.",Star Trek Into Darkness
294,patlightfoot,This great movie is a collectors item too.,10,19 September 2013,"I thought this was a great follow on from the first movie, and I hope JJ decides to give us a further sequel. The four or five main actors to me were well picked as their characters seem to fit in well with the older known actors of Kirk, Spock, Scotty, Chekov, Bones and having Benedict as Khan did not alarm me one bit. We have to forget that the Star Trek adventures of the TV series is now been changed or the future has been changed, that leads us into a new reality for the crew of Enterprise. I'm a fan of Benedict from his modern day Sherlock Holmes mini series. He is a brilliant actor and fitted the character I had of Khan, the man mad on developing super men and women, and eliminating anyone he considered inferior. So did Hitler remember. I did note and it did not turn out as I thought, when Kirk was dieing from radiation, and he placed his hand on the glass with Spock's, I was hoping he wouldn't copy what the original Spock said ',.The needs of the many out way the needs of the few?...""

The wrath Khan brings is no more modernly attuned to a social commentary as opposed to Star Trek : the Wrath of Khan (1982) , Where Khan was more representative of individualism.The only controversy that exists in this film is the acceptance of its viewing audience. Times change and with it, so do the movies we see in such times. The people in control of this franchise are not from the generation that founded it. What speaks to the certain masterwork that Gene Roddenberry created is, this movie proves something we all knew. Star Trek will be relevant and meaningful in both film history and as a concept of literature for many generations to come.Four stars(of 5.)",Star Trek Into Darkness
296,slicedbread117,An enthralling sci-fi epic makes its case for best picture of 2013.,9,27 August 2013,"I never got into Star Trek like I did Star Wars. Sure I have seen a few of the old TV series episodes and a couple of the movies, including Wrath of Kahn, but still that epic adventure was in a galaxy far far away for me. And then in 2009, J.J. Abrams changed all of that with the more-than-stellar reboot of the franchise which left me wanting more. Enter Star Trek: Into Darkness, a true sci-fi epic that had me wanting even more than the first time.When you're put in charge of creating a major motion picture for a franchise that has one of the largest followings in the world, the pressure can be immense. For J.J. Abrams, it was no problem. Right from the start of the movie I could tell that I was going to be treated to an action-packed movie filled with intense moments and solid humor throughout. I was not disappointed.Eventually we get to revisit one of the most iconic star ships of all- time, the USS Enterprise and it's wonderfully talented crew. The acting from the cast in the film was superb. Chris Pine, Zachary Quinto, Zoe Saldana, Karl Urban, Simon Pegg and John Cho among others nail their respective roles of Kirk, Spock, Uhura, Bones, Scotty and Sulu. Each character is developed well and you come to care for each one in their own way. Now let's get to business. Without going into spoilers, the movie's story was wonderful. It provided a great sense of action, emotion, fantasy, and mystery, and paid homage to an old Star Trek classic, that will have Trekkies screaming like little girls at a Justin Bieber concert. The action throughout the movie could be summed up in one simple if overused word: EPIC. Spectacular CG effects are on full display here and add to some wonderfully penned action sequences to create intense and exciting action scenes. Entire worlds are brought to life and the movie delivers a sense of scale few franchises can match.I won't say too much about the movie's main antagonist due to spoilers, but I will say that John Harrison (Benedict Cumberbatch) is a wonderful villain who is dark, mysterious and very dangerous. He his a villain you love to hate, and again, will have the Trekkies loving him even more by the end credits.On a little unrelated note, another thing this movie provided for me personally was security in J.J. Abrams. As most know, Abrams as been tasked with directing the other major ""Star"" franchise in the upcoming Star Wars: Episode VII. I know it seems like it has nothing to do with Into Darkness but it does, a lot actually. What I'm basically doing is praising J.J. Abrams for his work, showing me that I don't need to worry about Episode 7 after this masterpiece. Into Darkness is a fantastic sci-fi epic and after all, that's what Star Wars is as well. So this section of the review was really to applaud Abrams for his work and talents. I hope you bring your magic over to Star Wars.Now back to Star Trek. In conclusion, the Star Trek franchise has garnered my interest more than I thought it ever would thanks to its last two films. Into Darkness was in short, a spectacular movie. Full of talented acting that provides characters you care about and want to root for, exhilarating and immersing action supported by tremendous CGI, a sense of adventure and fantasy, fun humor that gives you a break from all the chaos, a very well paced and written story with a plot twist that fan boys will love, and all in all, it gives the Star Trek universe the movie it deserves. Star Trek: Into Darkness is a truly spectacular sci-fi adventure that has given me a new reason to become a Trekkie, and given me faith in another iconic franchise.9/10",Star Trek Into Darkness
297,cmv32261,I read the official Star Trek Into Darkness Spoiler FAQ,1,24 May 2013,"You had the person providing details to basically every primary scene of the move, every twist and turn in the plot. The movie was nothing more than poppy cock and balder dash, I would say hilarious if it were not for the fact completel unbelievable, pure fantasy in no way true Sci-Fi.. Khan cooperating with a Star Fleet Admiral, freezing lava with a Cold Fusion bomb, ha!, cold fusion bombs do not create cold. Super humans in torpedoes, yet again retarded, super star ship, Enterprise getting the crap beat out of it, after Scotty plugged up all the toilets of Death Star ship , can not recall what he did but creating massive pressure to build until it exploded. The idiot who in his review said he loved this movie must love the way wet cow manure sticks to anything you throw it at, no taste for cinema art whatsoever. Forgot to mention I also loved the part about Bones injecting a dead Tribble with Khan's blood and it coming back to life, and used the same technique to bring Kirk back to life. None of this movie was based on science in any essence of the word, merely bunk, junk, garbage, to quote Johnny 5: ""Shiat, where you see shiat"", I'll tell you where, watching J.J. Abrams mangled, twisted, bastardized versions of Star Trek.",Star Trek Into Darkness
298,Lost_In_Translation_,Did I watch the same movie as everyone else?,3,10 June 2019,"I saw 2009's Star Trek as someone unfamiliar with the series as a whole. It was a really fun and well made take on the series that has been around for 50 years now. Afterwards I watched most of the original series, which hasn't aged well, but I still enjoyed it.There were rumors for months that Khan was going to be the villain. As someone who never watched any of the movies, I only knew that he was revered as one of the best baddies in the Trek universe and in what was considered the best Trek movie until 2009. So the eventual reveal was meaningless to me, but it was just so weird why they needed to hide and deny it so much, when it is essentially a meaningless addition to the plot.Besides that, this one just was missing all of the charm of the first movie. That and the plot beats it decides to take really just aren't that enthralling at all. Klingons are added in an inconsequential scene, just for fan service. Khan's reveal is also some useless fan service. The Star Fleet Admiral that ends up being the baddie is lame and the subplot with him using Khan's people as rockets was just stupid.Going back on a few things from the ending of the 2009 movie are just annoying and question why they did them in the first place. Kirk became a captain at the end of the 2009 one, but it gets taken away right away after a botched mission. The Enterprises journey gets cancelled, and we're back at square one after a movie where we just got everything to that point and ready. Everything established in the first movie just gets undone to subvert expectations, but it just ruins the movie.I'm not a fanboy of Trek, but the whole Kirk and Spock role swap of the infamous ""KHAAAN"" scene was just really stupid. And then of course there's a plot device that allows Kirk to come back right away. It would have been cooler if it ended like ""Wrath"" and Kirk was gone for part of the next movie. The final ""action"" climax is also one of the most boring I've seen in a movie.It goes to show that Damon Lindelof is screenplay cancer as every film he has written ends up having the same feeling of disappointment when watching them. They all end up being a mixture of too many aspects that don't work and made unnecessarily complex to seem deep, when it ends up being inept, uneven storytelling.It's a shame the 4th movie is in limbo for now. Star Trek Beyond was a fun return to form and Lindelof not touching it showed that there are people out there who can write a neat adventure of the crew of the Enterprise, the one that this 2nd movie should have been!",Star Trek Into Darkness
299,dinalt10,Good - but not perfect,7,7 September 2013,"There are a lot of negative reviews out there, and while I wouldn't say the film's perfect, I think a lot of the criticism is unjustified.I also think some people haven't seen the first in the reboot series, as comments saying how could Khan teleport to Chronos overlook the fact that future Spock gave the formula to Scotty in the first film.I enjoyed the film. People will either love or hate reboots - personally I grew up on Sci-Fi, and I've seen remakes/reboots of many of my old favourites - Blakes 7 (new audio adventures), Dr Who, Lost In Space, Battlestar Galactica.........and the myriad of Star Trek spin off series.The film itself is again beautifully filmed, and the cast generally work well together.But there are some areas I didn't like.Karl Urban seemed very much underused - which is a shame, as he's a great actor. But his role seemed diminished to just uttering the odd clichéd line, the old 'I'm a Doctor not a (insert subject) has been done to death. If there's a third instalment, I hope they pad the character out and make McCoy more than a token character.Why reintroduce Khan as one of the main enemies ? The original Star Trek 2 (Wrath Of Khan) is still aired regularly in the UK - and while Benedict Cumberbatch did a great job, it seemed like a copout to have the same villain in both second Star Trek movies.And while Khans obviously genetically engineered, why does his blood now seem to have miraculous properties ? It can heal the sick and even raise the dead!! If his genetic structure is that perfect, then surely that means Khan himself would never age and never die.And reversing the death roles between Spock and Kirk seemed pointless at the end. Not only because the original death scene conveyed so much (Kirk & Spocks friendship over many years), but also because it was obvious that Khans blood would be the key to bringing him back from the dead.That said, I enjoyed it - but as the title says, it's not perfect.",Star Trek Into Darkness
300,donuthaters12,Ambitious And Thematically Deeper,9,29 November 2013,"4 years after the reboot of the popular franchise directed by J.J Abrams has now returned with a sequel. Star Trek Into Darkness is definitely a much anticipated sequel due to the first film being successful commercially and critically. This sequel have been argued whether or not this is an improvement over it's predecessor, but there is one thing I can guarantee and is that this film is definitely a well made Science Fiction Action film.Star Trek Into Darkness was written by Alex Kurtzman, Damon Lindelof & Roberto Orci, and all three acts as screenwriters and producers of this film and it's predecessor. The sequels of the franchise is usually the best opportunity for the writers to dish out the best stories for the franchise as they are not restricted in having to explain the characters back stories and having to define the relationship between characters. Star Trek Into Darkness can truly be a film of it's own. The writers have definitely written something I found enjoyable with a plot that is intriguing and a villain that is so mesmerizing to watch that we wouldn't mind if the film focused on him even more. The film's screenplay is definitely thematically deeper than the first film. The film explores themes of friendship, death, sacrifice, and family. This did impress me in comparison to other blockbuster films released this year and it's something that I will definitely come back to over and over again and it would still not lose it's steam.J. J. Abrams comes back to direct this sequel of his successful Star Trek reboot. Abrams have definitely crafted something much better than it's predecessor as this may be due to a much better understanding and connection to the source material. Abrams have crafted something that is different from the other Star Trek films released but able to relate and throwback elements from the classics. Abrams have made something deep and entertaining. It may not be as in your face and pretentious as other films that touches the same themes as it still retains it's action packed entertainment approach which I don't mind either as long as it is executed with flourish, and Abrams has executed with such flourish. Abrams were able to sneak in some still and heartbreaking moments that surprisingly made me care about the characters, which is something I usually dismiss in films like this. This does give me more faith with Abrams future films, as he has disappointed me before like Mission Impossible 3. I hope he does return for a sequel to this film as he definitely revived a franchise to a new generation and hopefully for future ones.Daniel Mindel comes back as the director of photography for this film. Mindel is more known as an action director and he is a frequent collaborator with Abrams, aside from Super 8. Mindel and Abrams have brought back the beautiful photography that was present on the first film. The visual effects in this film do look impressive and improves the already fascinating effects from the first film. The lens flare in this film is much more toned down, or maybe it just seemed less distracting due to the improved technique in photographing this film. The shots that Abrams and Mindel uses for this film, especially within the ship, are filled with panning and this is due to the great blocking that Abrams employs in his shots allowing the film to be constantly in motion but without relying on the shaking effect of hand-held camera. As the film does contain certain intimate moments, I felt that they were shot fantastically and adds on to the tension or emotion that Abrams wants to convey or bring out from us.Michael Giacchino is responsible for the film's score. When the film's theme song plays, it gives me the chills as it just makes me think that we are coming into a special film. Giacchino has brought the good areas from his score of the first film and improved upon that with this film feeling much more ambitious and heavy. Though the moment at the start of the film with the sick child contains a beautiful piece driven by a piano. Giacchino definitely knows how to suck us in with his scores, just listen to his work on the Pixar films like Up and Ratatouille.The actors in this film is more focused solely on their interaction with one another rather than a separate entity of it's own like the first film, due to the first film focusing on their backstory and how that connects to the way these characters are. I can definitely say that these actors work well together and more moments show their acting range. Pine and Quinto banter and acting, particularly in scenes where their relationship and feelings towards one another are being discussed and explored, have definitely grabbed on to me; making me care about the decisions of these characters and empathise with them. A stand out performance from Benedict Cumberbatch is definitely something that needs to be noted when praising this film. Great and scene stealing villains are not something unique in films nowadays but his is something that cannot be ignored. If I am to nitpick, I am still a little disappointed with Karl Urban's character being a source of one liners, the character is also written quite campy which does become a distraction for me. All in all the actors did a great job and hopefully the next film will allow more screen time to flesh out both the actors and the characters they play.Star Trek Into Darkness is ambitious and thematically deeper than it's predecessor. It is also more entertaining and features a villain that we won't forget. I hope that Abrams come back for a third installment and somehow improve on a film that is definitely one of the best blockbuster films of 2013.",Star Trek Into Darkness
301,andrewnmiller,A nearly perfect sequel to an already great film.,7,3 December 2016,"After seeing the first Star Trek film and loving it, I was excited to see Star Trek: Into Darkness and after watching it, I can say that while it does have problems, I still loved this film just as much as the first one due to the tone, visual effects, acting, and action.The film opens with Captain Kirk and Dr. Bones escaping hostile natives on the planet Nibiru, but they give away their presence to the natives and as a result, Kirk is removed from command of the Enterprise and Admiral Pike is put in command instead with Kirk being reduced to a commander and Spock is relocated to another ship. Afterwards, a Starfleet turncoat named John Harrison attacks the Section 31 building in London and soon after attacks Starfleet headquarters, killing Pike and several high-ranking officers. Admiral Alexander Marcus recalls Kirk and Spock to the Enterprise with orders to find and kill Harrison only to find out that Harrison is more than what he seems.When it comes to making a tentpole summer blockbuster like this, it doesn't need to have a lot of mind-numbing, grating trash; something Abrams, the writers and everyone else involved strived to give us a film that much like the first film feels renewed and persistently thrilling, but doesn't deviate from the story and characters. The Star Trek series has a wonderful legacy for the past 50 years and as a result, has had a massive impact on the science fiction genre and to just throw all that history and legacy away for something with all flash and no soul would be seen as a crime of sorts, but with Star Trek: Into Darkness; that is clearly not the case. Sure, once the film starts, there seems to be hardly any time to stop and slow down, but when it does take time to slow down just enough time for us to dig deeper into the characters' personas and what is happening aboard the Enterprise, making it easy to remain invested throughout the 2-hour run time which moves so much more quicker.The story does allow time for emotional things like the relationships between the characters such as Spock and Uhura, and the willingness to sacrifice one's life in order to save others. As with the first film, there is a fair amount of character development especially with Kirk learning to be more humble and what being a hero is all about and Spock is still battling with his human and Vulcan sides, but as the film progresses, he learns to be more in touch with his emotions and he and Kirk grow to appreciate each other better with Kirk learning how to obey and follow orders and Spock learns how to be expressive and reckless.The film also delves into the topic of the perils of a military leader with too much power, the dishonesty and clandestineness used by said leader, the extent he is willing to go, giving raise to the likelihood of a military dictator. The similarities between the state of the world today and what is presented in this movie makes for an interesting study such as the scene where Harrison is awakened or when Scotty protests the usage of unapproved torpedoes and accused of defying orders and although the viewer can concur that Scotty is right in his actions to provide aid in deterring the events of the film as they progress, even though he is aware that he will be arrested for disloyalty for his actions which raises the question of is there ever a time when betrayal is appropriate? Much like the first one, the visual and sound effects are fantastic with the same sounds the original 60s show used like the beaming effect and the sound of the warp drive while the visual effects give a far greater scoop to the world of Star Trek and showcases a variety of different planets that all differ in technology and culture and the effects really show that here. JJ adds more lens flares which add a nice dash of style to the final film.Of course, this film would be nothing without its actors and they all deliver here. Chris Pine once again nails it as Captain Kirk by coming into his own as a leader and yet retraining the womanizing, hot-headed, arrogant attitude that we have come to expect and love and has made the role of Captain Kirk his own. Zachary Quinto continues to knock it out of the park as Spock by being the ground for Kirk to stand upon and the interactions between Pine and Quinto is just perfect. Karl Urban is once again fantastic as Bones, channeling DeForest Kelly's habits and persona so perfectly as well as having some great one-liners. Anton Yelchin is wonderful as Chekov, John Cho continues to impress as Sulu, Zoe Saldana rocks it as Uhura and Simon Pegg has never been better as Scotty. Peter Weller puts in a great performance as Admiral Marcus and Alice Eve plays Carol Marcus very well. Of course, the true star of the movie is Benedict Cumberbatch as John Harrison/Khan and it goes without saying that he delivers in this movie. Cumberbatch is such an enthralling actor who recognizes how much screen time to chew up without coming across as silly and his cleverness and physical power make him more than a match for the Enterprise crew and his performance of vacant expressions and motionless eyes make for a truly chilling performance.Now, the movie does have its share of problems like at times, it does rip off Wrath of Khan in a few scenes and it really didn't make sense to just kill Kirk off and bring him back a scene later, but in spite of all that, I really did love this movie. It's certainly worth watching even you're not a fan of Star Trek.",Star Trek Into Darkness
302,dutchs-1,Not the Wrath of Khan,8,27 June 2013,"The only other time I've seen Benedict Cumberbatch was in Amazing Grace, and there he put his icy upper class British arrogance to good use as William Pitt, working behind the scenes to end the slave trade. This time he's the villain, still icy, arrogant and British, and he lays it on with a trowel. (Hero or villain, dang, I like this guy) In the original Star Trek episode, Khan and his followers had been put in suspended animation and unwittingly revived. They tried to take over the Enterprise, were defeated, and marooned on a planet with the intent of allowing them to colonize it. In The Wrath of Khan, a Federation expedition unknowingly lands on the planet (apparently they didn't keep records very well), allowing Khan to escape again and try to resume his career of conquest.Since it takes place before the split in the Star Trek timeline, Khan's back story must remain intact. But having the villain named Khan and having him try to take over the Enterprise is about as far as the similarities go. In this version, he's revived by a war-hungry Federation admiral who's hankering to have a war with the Klingons. Khan blows up a secret Federation think tank, tries to take out the Federation High Command, and escapes to the Klingon home world. Kirk goes after him and the rest is an intricate web of scheming, double-crossing and sabotage between Kirk, Khan, and the Admiral. If you see the Wrath of Khan on DVD and then watch this film, there will be no spoilers whatsoever.For all the ferocious criticism it's gotten, Alice Eve's bra and panties scene lasts only about one second. Blink and you'd miss it. Frankly I'm amazed they were even able to get a clear frame grab to post on all the discussion sites.The first half of the film does a nice job of delineating the characters in more detail without being heavy-handed about it. The middle third has a lot of action and plot twists. The finale, where Khan crashes his ship into San Francisco, and then Spock and Khan slug it out on top of flying whatchamacallits, is a bit drawn out, not to mention clichéd. The movie ends with Khan and his crew safely back in cryo-storage, ready to be unthawed for future villainy.I do have to mention the preposterous beginning. Kirk tries to save a primitive race from a catastrophic volcanic eruption. They do this with a ""cold fusion"" device, which apparently the script writers think has something to do with refrigeration. The device freezes the lava and stops the eruption, and nobody seems to suspect that the pressures under the volcano are still building, setting the stage for an even more catastrophic eruption in the future.",Star Trek Into Darkness
303,hifiman-62270,Best star trek movie,10,30 April 2021,Great acting. Stunning visuals. Great fun. Not sure the hate from Fanboys..of which I'm one. It's the most successful trek movie for a reason....,Star Trek Into Darkness
304,guenterfmang,Quite mediocre for a Blockbuster SciFi Movie,6,12 March 2021,I guess you have to be a Trekkie to find this interesting,Star Trek Into Darkness
305,RyanEberhart,Excellent!,10,22 September 2013,"For the Star Trek purists out there Star Trek Into Darkness must have been a slap in the face. I call it a masterful rework of a classic in which one of the evilest characters to come out of the Star Trek universe, ever, was once again matched up against the Enterprise crew and her captain. J.J. Abrams outdid his work in the first movie of this new series when he reworked the script of Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan to create Star Trek Into Darkness.As this is a movie that came out this year I will not tell you how it ended. But, what I will tell you is that if you watched The Wrath of Khan and then you watch Into Darkness, you will either be pleasantly surprised at some of the reversals in what happens to some of the characters, or you will be angered beyond compare. I doubt there is any in between.What I will do is tell you about three scenes from the beginning of the movie up to about the half way point. I liked that the same cast from the first movie was back with some additions that were pretty good as well as visually appealing, I'll explain that later.The first scene I liked was when Dr. ""Bones"" McCoy (Karl Urban) and Captain James T. Kirk (Chris Pine) are supposed to be observing a primitive alien species. Unfortunately, a volcano threatens to destroy the planet and it is decided to ""freeze"" the lava before it can do it's job. In the process of stopping the volcano Spock (Zachary Quinto) is trapped inside the volcano. After escaping the indigenous peoples of the planet Kirk violates the Prime Directive by directly affecting the development of the civilization when he reveals his ship to them. The primitive aliens abandon their religion and begin to worship the Enterprise. This is pretty funny. Spock says the line ""The needs of the many out weigh the needs of the few."" This line was said by Leonard Nimoy as Spock in Wrath of Khan, and Leonard Nimoy said it again in The Transformers Dark of the Moon as Sentinel Prime.Another scene I liked was when Spock mind-melded with Admiral Pike (Bruce Greenwood) as Pike lay dying. Pike had been wounded by John Harrison (Benedict Cumberbatch), who turned out to be Khan. Later it is revealed that when Spock did his mind-meld with Spock he felt fear, anger, confusion, loneliness and that he had felt these emotions before when Vulcan was destroyed. He vowed never to feel these emotions again which is why he couldn't comprehend why Nyoto Uhura (Zoe Saldana) was upset with him for taking the risk he did to stop the volcano.Another scene I liked is when McCoy and Dr. Carol Marcus (Eve Alice) attempt to see what is so special about the photon torpedoes they were given to launch at Khan to destroy him. I won't tell what was so special, just know that this was a nice twist. At the same time, I think it was amazing what Kirk sent Scotty (Simon Pegg) to investigate. Again I won't give away what he found.Eve Alice is what I meant by visually pleasing. She was the lead actress in one of my favorite comedy movies, She's Out Of My League. Very funny. She is very attractive and in my opinion an underrated actress because of her attractiveness.Again J.J. Abrams brings amazing graphics and rewrites a script to make a masterful epic movie.I give Star Trek Into Darkness 10 stars out of 10 stars.",Star Trek Into Darkness
306,amexspam,Where was the whale?,6,14 June 2013,"I'm beginning to think that studios pay people to deluge sites like this to give 10 ratings when they know it is a mediocre or lousy movie. It's the only way films like this could possibly get an 8.2 average rating. The first movie was very good, it was well re-imagined and the cast did an incredible job of capturing the original characters. Any sequel had to be worse because the big surprise of character recapture had already been accomplished. However, with the trekkie base as long as it didn't stink, you have a success. On that basis, this movie was a success. It was an okay movie and I'll watch it again when it hits TV. However, the script seems like the writers spent most of their time going ""I got nuthin"" so they simply recycled old plots, old emotions, and even old script lines from past Star Trek movies, with most emphasis of one of them. I understand the plot of the next sequel is that since Earth is out of dolphins, that the crew goes back in time to 2013 Oakland to find some.",Star Trek Into Darkness

308,Jalea,I Liked it Very Much,9,27 May 2013,"I cannot say I LOVED it, but I did LIKE it, very much. It is a 21st Century reboot of a beloved series. Let me first say that there is no way the any director or group of actors can recapture the magic of the original Star Trek series of the 1960s. Mr. Spock's subtly sarcastic and thinly veiled elitist tone played by Mr. Nimoy is untouchable. The egotistical yet fiercely caring and loyal, calculatingly yet impulsive, Captain Kirk played William Shatner was done brilliantly with a figurative *wink* at the audience. Therefore, it would be utterly ridiculous to even attempt to duplicate the magic of William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy. And, the story lines were also fantastic, considering the limited time and budget the writers/producers had to work with. I think that is why they keep rehashing them, because they were so well written and thought out in the first place. If you check all of the Star Trek series, many of the stories of the 1960s were redone in some shape or form in each of the series of the 1980s on, including the movies.However, JJ Abrams and the actors have managed to capture the essence of Star Trek; good acting, action with some humor thrown in. I do like the new Spock and Captain Kirk. I like the fact that they are still the major players, because that is true to the series. I like the fact that the key to their teamwork is their friendship and eventually mutual respect. Zachary Quinto has managed to emote some of the sarcastic tone of the original Mr. Spock as well as his inner struggle. Mr. Quinto does have a hard act to follow, as does Chris Pine as Captain Kirk. But, he does have the charm, good looks, wicked humor to pull it off. And yes, Kirk for the most part gets every girl, except Lt. Uhura. Benedict Cumberbach looks nothing like Richardo Montalban who played Khan in the series and movie. Yet, he managed to make the role his own; the commanding, fierce ruthlessness and physical presence. Lithe, lean yet muscular enough to convince us of his physicality. Eloquent, elitist, dismissive of others, his body language and facial expressions appropriately communicate his attitude of superiority.The special effects were fantastic. I saw it in 3D and I must say the visual effects people had a field day. But, there was still enough focus on the story so that you did not feel like the whole movie an orgy of explosions and CGI. There was some creative license taken with the story line, so if you are a purist, it will upset you. However, if you listen carefully, there are hints and allusions (details) in the story that only hardcore trekkies would recognize, which I won't give away (the movie has just been released less than two weeks ago after all). I do not think that Star Trek has lost its way, the essence of Star Trek is still there -- if you look closely enough. I could not give this movie a ten because of the changes to the original story line surrounding some of the characters.",Star Trek Into Darkness
309,andrew-huggett,Don't sit too close to the (IMAX 3-D) screen!,8,14 May 2013,"This is an excellent follow-up to the first film in the re-booted series – essentially, the story is a re-imagining of the Khan story in the alternate reality created in the previous film. There are some stunning action sequences and a detailed imagining of London and San Francisco in the 23rd Century. Unfortunately, we were only able to book seats 3 rows up from the front and were too close to the screen. I look forward to seeing this again with more space between me and the screen so that I can enjoy the detail and better cope with the very fast action sequences. It would be nice to see a TV series now come out of this (which would allow smaller scale drama / hard science fiction without the need for so much epic-level action) but with the same high production values, same principal actors and use of the same film sets – as the crew now go on their 5 year mission. Perhaps such a TV series could be inter-leaved with one or two more big budget movies  Excellent but spoilt for me by the 3-D IMAX presentation.

310,watchtiger1,One of the worst Star Treks of the franchise,2,5 June 2013,"The only thing good was the explosions that is why I give it 2 stars.The acting is mediocre at best, this movie is 3 HOURS long that's 1 hour too long. After the ""secret"" is revealed the movie becomes overly predictable even the switch up of the ""Spock"" and ""Kirk"" roles of the past in another former Star Trek movie. There are script problems with this movie and story problems as well, Roddenberry is spinning around earth (his ashen remains were shot into space a few years after his death) p.o.ed at this incarnation of the film. Acting is not smooth. This actors are just too young and do not fit the parts they were given. I realize Paramount wanted younger actors so the could get a number of films out of them with out a change but they went too young. It is because it's unbelievable that the Chirs Pike; J.T. Kirk is old enough to be a captain of a star ship. It just doesn't work as a movie. I hope J.J. Abrams doesn't ruin Star Wars as he did with this Star Trek Movie.",Star Trek Into Darkness
311,feritciva,Phil Collins' Star Trek!,8,23 June 2013,"Now if you're not a real music fan, you probably will not follow this review, but history of Genesis (rock-band) splits into two distinct parts. Genesis was a progressive rock group in 70's - one of the best we can say. All the songs are perfect, all lyrics are crazy, the shows were theatrical and amazing. That was Peter Gabriel's Genesis.Then after Gabriel leaves, Phil Collins takes control and turns the band into a pop-group in 80's. Old skool Genesis fans still remember Invisible touch and especially I Cant Dance with pain. This is Phil Collins' Genesis. It is always criticized as being shallow, lifeless, dumb version of 70's progressive Genesis.Now these old skool critics tend to forget that there was no place for a progressive group who makes 22 minutes of complex songs in 80's music. 80's were about fun, new wave & light party music. And you know what, Phil Collins just made this passage for Genesis very cleverly and fine. Just listen to Tonight, Tonight, Tonight or Land of Confusion. These are great 80's songs. To be honest although one of my all time favorite groups is 70's Genesis, I also really love 80's Genesis.Aaand at last coming back to Star Trek Into Darkness, this is Phil Collins' Star Trek. Old timers (progressive trekkers) will possibly hate it - but if you're a hardcore sci-fi fan, you'll really enjoy this movie.

They've deliberately hijacked the characters, made them into a terrorist sleeper cell now activated in our midst to bring us explosions, Star Fleet on steroids, Spock jumping from the roof of one in-flight vehicle to another to show us he's not really that intellectual wuss Hollywoood hates-- he's a tough street fighter--get ,im, Spock!All 3D and action clichés, no ideas or vision, cartoon characters not worth...no wait, this is no accident or lazy business.

Whilst all of that is true, its still a good story, albeit a bit long.

To control him? A guy who can transport across light years isn't controllable. His vision to militarize Starfleet doesn't resonate for the audience because we don't know why he wants this nor are we made to care.Khan: why put his own people into the admiral's warheads? Does he know that the admiral will get the Enterprise to fire them at him on Qo'Nos? Are they supposed to land gently on the surface so he can revive them then? If he has access to them in the first place, revive them and be on your merry way.The admiral KNOWS Khan put his people in the warheads, I just don't understand what anybody's motives are in this movie.That nonsense in the beginning with the volcano: why submerge the Enterprise when you don't have to? ""They (the natives) saw the Enterprise!"" They were going to eventually unless you planned to keep it underwater forever, it has to come up at some time! The scene with Kirk, Spock and Uhura felt real and I actually really liked it and found it touching but Kirk's death was phoned in.

318,The_Other_Snowman,A Parody with No Jokes,4,7 June 2014,"Have a look at the IMDb message boards for ""Star Trek Into Darkness"" and you'll see that most of the criticism from serious Trek fans focuses either on the film's plot holes or on the many ways director JJ Abrams and his writers have altered canonical Star Trek. Yes, there are plenty of plot holes worthy of nitpicking: transwarp beaming, life-saving blood transfusions, and characters with inconsistent motives. There are obviously all kinds of differences from old Trek, like the heroes' ages and accents and the size of the Starship Enterprise.But really, none of that matters, because ""Star Trek Into Darkness"" is little more than an average summer action extravaganza, with spaceships instead of superheroes and aliens instead of orcs. There's a bad guy who wants to blow stuff up, and good guys who have to stop him, and there's an endless parade of chases, fights, explosions, and punch-ups. So what makes this a Star Trek movie? Not much.Watching the film as a Trek fan is an odd experience, because even though it has Captain Kirk, Mr. Spock, the Enterprise, the colorful uniforms, Klingons, and tribbles, they all feel completely out of place, like obscure cultural references randomly grafted onto a generic plot skeleton in an effort to distinguish it from every other summer blockbuster. Zachary Quinto shouting ""Khaaan!"" sounds more like a joke than an homage -- the sort of line you'd expect to hear dropped into the middle of a cartoon farce. The production design combines totalitarian militarism with Brutalist architecture and shiny modern interiors, while the cast charges through the breathless action sequences with barely a spark of life in them.The pacing seems to have been designed to help numb the audience into mindless acceptance of the script's scatterbrained plot. For about 90% of the movie, the characters are running, shouting, or fighting, with lots of falling, jumping, and flying through the vacuum of space in rocket-powered spacesuits. Even when they're sitting still, the camera never stops manically whizzing around them, inducing motion sickness in any audience members who lack the intestinal fortitude of a fighter pilot. When the shooting starts, it's quite impossible to tell what's going on -- the dim lighting, bludgeoning sound, and frenetic camera-work create a jumble of images all jostling each other for our attention, and all losing.This is the standard approach to special effects films: bigger, faster, louder. The idea behind them is to generate a sort of mental and cognitive vacuum in which the audience can wallow for about 132 minutes. Movies like this don't inspire us to think or feel, because if we do we'll realize that nothing we've been watching makes the least bit of sense. ""Into Darkness"" is a parody of Star Trek, an earnest TV show that, despite campy effects and clunky writing, always tried to make us think.",Star Trek Into Darkness
319,mistabobdobolina,"Better than the first ""reboot"" film, but that isn't saying much",5,20 May 2013,"Viacom/Paramount made a calculated gamble in giving the Trek franchise to J.J. Abrams. The gamble was that his being an intellectually unsophisticated director known best for empty cleverness and slick visuals -- and who additionally didn't give a sh*t about the original Trek material -- could work in their favor. With a slick enough coat of paint, he could make it look like he was ""reviving"" the franchise instead of hollowing it out into a witless, mediocre version of its former self.With the first movie, the gamble worked: even many a dedicated fanboy poured drool over that plot less and mostly-insulting mess because they were thrilled about how new it all looked. I'm heartened to see that at least some of these have started to get wise to the empty trickery that's being offered up to them under the wrapping of the Trek franchise.Ironically, this has the effect of creating a harsher reaction to what is actually much the better of the two Abrams films. Abrams' Trek is still ridiculous, mind you: its technology and universe inhabiting rubber rules that break suspension of disbelief routinely, its Starfleet still cartoonish and laughable, its cocktail of references to the old films and series serving as reminders of how little its creators ""get"" any of that material (and that's before we get to ""Khan""). It is still Trek for people who never gave a sh*t about Trek -- it's no accident that half of those raving about it usually preface it with ""I never really was into Trek, but"" -- and just as with the first installment has decided to sacrifice the franchise's unique aspects to make it a contender in the brainless-actioner market. Apparently not understanding that the ""I never really was into Trek"" audience won't have any more loyalty to this series of brainless actioners than any other.Having said that: at least ""Into Darkness"" *had* a plot. Its pieces fit together logically in a way that just can't be managed with its predecessor. Granted, much of that plot was cadged from the far better film ""The Wrath of Khan"" -- but there was at least fleeting entertainment to be had in watching them reverse the old ""beautiful death scene"" from that film, and I actually quite enjoyed Quinto's call- out to the old ""KHHAAAN!"" yell. Of course all the action could have come from any other action franchise (like the ""Millennium Falcon"" chase on the surface of Kronos) and the wearily-inevitable Leonard Nimoy cameo can go die in a fire along with Scotty's rock-monster sidekick, and the action is unfocused and frenetic and poorly-paced and fades even a performance as good as Cumberbatch's into the background... but what was anyone expecting? We know by now that the Abrams version of the franchise is the Fast and the Furious in Space.The really great strength of the Abrams films has been not the effects, but the cast. Everyone -- even Yelchin, this time -- does their absolute best with their screen time and with the uninspiring material they're given to work with. These people can act, and clearly love their roles and clearly try to make some emotional impact; it's not their fault that the scripting and pacing is so mediocre. One keeps seeing flashes of what could have been in the hands of a better directing and writing team: like the power Cumberbatch could have brought to his *own* villain role instead of being forced to serve up a retreading of Khan in minimal screen time. Oh yeah: the effects are great, and the action set-pieces are visually spectacular. But we know it takes more than either of those things to make a movie, right?",Star Trek Into Darkness

But then, Captain Kirk gives the order to fly the Enterprise to the volcano and rescue Spock, even if it means exposing the starship to the people of the planet, who still live in the stone ages. That's against the rules and Kirk gets punished for it back on earth -- he's relieved of his command. But's that's just the first ten minutes of this terrific movie, where the pace never lets up.

Star Trek 2009 was without question one of the best movies released that summer, it had great acting, some really good action, it looked gorgeous, and it had a good plot to go with it. Star Trek Into Darkness has the crew of the Enterprise going after a terrorist named John Harrison, who was once one of the Federation's top agents. The plot may sound really generic, but believe me when I say that it isn't. It goes to some places that really caught me off guard. And as for the villain: Best villain since Darth Vader. Believe me when I say this: Benedict Cumberpatch is an incredible actor, he truly steals the show whenever he comes on screen. And he is without a doubt the best villain in the franchise's long history. Everybody else in the cast gives great performances as well. And as for Spock and Kirk, it is still such a joy to see them work together, and their banter is truly great. The action set pieces are awesome, as the movie whisk you from one incredible action scene to the next you will barely have time to catch your breath.There is however some minor problems I have with the film: The constant need of the film to reference previous entries is kind of irritating, and the ending is pretty predictable.

325,haosstoposto,Too much which becomes too little,7,22 May 2013,"After a long wait, a disappointing movie. Or probably the hype was too great after superb trailers. The first part was way better because we were in an uncharted territory where anything can happen, and it did - for example the destruction of planet Vulkan. Now in this movie we have by-the-numbers action and a very thin plot with a couple of not so great plot twists. The creators of the movie have managed to keep the identity of the mail villain secret and after so much speculation from the fans it has become irrelevant who he is, at least for me. The creators of the movie have played on this single card and the rest of the movie suffers greatly because of that. The main problem of this movie is, to be honest, a paper-thin plot. All that happens in the movie is as follows: a terrorist manages to eradicate half the starfleet captains and then teleports (!) to the Klingon homeworld Kronos, Kirk&Crew receive orders to find-him-and-kill-him"", Kirk than decides to capture him instead, the terrorist kills couple of Klingons and then he surrenders and reveals himself as Khan (no further explanation necessary), then arrives the second villain of the movie-an admiral who wants to start a war with the Klingons and he has a brand new ship (like USS Excelsior from the original time line), there is a undramatic and chaotic space battle, some gun- and fistfights and then Khan takes over admirals ship, then follows a chase on Earth and a happy end. This plot points do not last much longer on screen, everything happens too quickly, not allowing for the suspense to build. But there are some redeeming points as well. Spock is brilliant in this movie and steals every scene he is in. I love his reasoning and his adamant moral. The new Klingons are very cool. We see that they have managed to destroy their moon Praxis and their homeworld ahead of time. And this time they did not have chancellor Gorkon to make peace with the Federation. I hope we will have relentless enemies in them for the future movies. Space battles between Enterprise and Admiral's new ship are pretty underwhelming. Enterprise is a sitting duck and keeps receiving punishment in every battle, which becomes boring after a while. Great final battle in The Undiscovered Country"" is something the director could have drew an inspiration from. And of course we have Kirks sacrifice at the end so his ship and crew would live. It is a copy of Spock's death from The Wrath of Khan"" and sadly it is a missed opportunity. The scene fails to be dramatic or sad or significant. In the moment where Kirk enters a radioactive warp core, I knew how he will be cured. To be honest I had hoped that Spock would try to enter this warp core and that the old Spock"" would take his place, but that was an ordinary wishful thinking of an old ST fan. Benedikt Cumberbatch is superb as a villain Khan but the emotional connection between him and Kirk is absent in this movie, which makes sense because they met for the first time in this time line. Nevertheless, the screen dynamic between Khan and Kirk from The Wrath of Khan"" was better. I hope that the creators of this new Star Trek will avoid similar mistakes for the future movies, because this new reboot of the series has great potential because all bets are off. Good luck next time.",Star Trek Into Darkness

It was also really nice to see Peter Weller again and I think Karl Urban was inspired casting, although I hear, sadly, he won't be playing any more roles as 'Bones'.

His camera work and set pieces are well composed. He manages to balance great humor with a lot of emotional and dramatic depth. I, in particular, really like how every character is showcased well. They don't just take the back seat to Kirk and Spock. Action sequences are well choreographed and really gets the blood pumping. There are so many moments where I am legitimately worried about the faith of a character.The characters are great and retain a lot of what we love about them from the first movie. Kirk, Chris Pine, in particular shows a lot of growth. He slowly turns from an arrogant captain to an actual leader. Spock's dedication to Kirk is commendable and he has some really great moments near the end of the film. Zachery Quinto is amazing as this character to a point where he matches even surpasses the original. Benedict Cumberbatch as Khan is great. His portrayal is menacing and he even has moments where we feel sorry for him.Overall ""Star Trek Into Darkness"" is a really great movie with lots of great action, a compelling story, and characters that are incredibly likable. Michael Giacchino's score is fantastic and comes in at the right time to where everything just becomes better. His score has a layer of mystery and adventure in it that just absorbs the audience into the film. The one problem I had with this film is towards the end. It had me scratching my head, but it has to do something with Khan and his blood. However, that's just a minor nitpick in a fantastic movie.

329,jjgooner,Just Another Predictable Action Film,5,6 July 2013,"Star Trek Into Darkness** (out of 4)132 mins/ 12Cast: Chris Pine, Zachary Quinto, Zoe Saldana, Karl Urban, Simon Pegg, John Cho, Benedict Cumberbatch, Anton Yelchin, Bruce Greenwood, Peter Weller, Alice Eve, Noel Clarke, Leonard NimoyDirector: J.J AbramsPlot: Captain leads a mission to capture the mysterious John Harrison who has started a one- man massacre of the Federation's cities and people. JJ's Verdict: After the 5-star reboot that J.J Abrams gave us in 2009, I was expecting a 5-star follow-up. This is part of the problem. Star Trek was something brilliant, and completely more than just an action film. Star Trek Into Darkness, however, 'is' just an action film. The strange thing is that the opening scenes of Into Darkness lead you to believe it is going to brilliant. We jump straight into the action as Kirk and McCoy are being chased by an alien species and Spock is forced to stop a volcano exploding by jumping into it. These opening scenes are beautifully paced, full of exciting action and of course, contain those much-required human elements. Once we actually get into the film, the main plot is very interesting and leaves you thinking you are about to witness something great. The plot centres on a fugitive, John Harrison, who has taken refuge on a Klingon planet after blowing up Federation buildings and killing many Starfleet officials. From here, Captain Kirk and his Enterprise crew are of course sent to capture him and bring him back to Earth. They eventually do but of course he finds a way to escape and disaster ensues. This disaster I'm talking about actually has two meanings. One is that this Harrison is actually the famous Khan and goes on to try and destroy the crew; and the other is the rest of the film. The film presents us with Khan's master plan, which is actually, one of the most predictable I've ever seen. Because the second half of the film is solely focused on defeating him, you know each move he will make and exactly what the outcome will be. This causes all the action to be meaningless and the dialogue scenes just a distraction. When the best part of your action film is actually your characters bickering among themselves, you know you've got a problem.Of course, on top of the opening sequence, there are some good elements in this film. Like any film of its genre, the visuals are great and as previously mentioned, the character interaction is great. The acting is solid overall with the exception of Simon Pegg who manages to steal every single one of his scenes – even if he only says one line! Like the 2009 film, his comedic timing is perfect. Bruce Greenwood, who reprises his role as Christopher Pike, is the film's bright spark when it comes to serious acting and the only other positive acting is in Karl Urban and the legendary Leonard Nimoy who are dreadfully under-used. The film's only stumbling block in the characters is in Alice Eve, who's posh, edginess fail to fit the film's style, and surprisingly, Benedict Cumberbatch. Apart from the fact that he is miscast as a character supposedly Indian, the British actor portrays his character very one-dimensionally in the first half, and then very awkwardly over-dramatic in the second half. Another problem with Star Trek Into Darkness is that it feels very much like a remake of The Wrath of Khan in 1982. The characters background is told in a way that the filmmakers want you to think of him as a new character. But anyone who has previously seen the older Star Treks will struggle to do so. My most awful and cringing moment of the film, however, was a recreation of Spock's final scene in The Wrath of Khan. This time it is Kirk in the glass and Spock on the outside. I haven't compared them but I'm pretty sure they say roughly the same thing, which it very boring and you know the outcome. It fails to pack the emotional punch it was trying to make. To make matters worse and to plunge this thing in to darkness, Spock screams KHAN! Just totally cringing.",Star Trek Into Darkness

The special effects were incredible and it just simply worked!If you want an entertaining couple of hours I urge you to watch this. You shouldn't be bored for even a second. It really is that good. Whether you're a stargeek or a cool person that wont admit they watch Star Trek you WILL LIKE THIS FILM.P.S. Oh and for us stargeeks out there, this one DID have Star Trek Canon in it when it had a small model of the Enterprise from the ST:ENT series in the Admirals office. As we all know Enterprise was a prequel to Kirk's enterprise so everything that happened in ENT happened in this same alternate Star Trek Universe so that was a nice addition for us geeks.

331,TimMeade,Enjoyable Hokum,8,3 June 2013,"Does this sound at all familiar? Captain Kirk is insubordinate, disobeys orders and is demoted from his command. An emergency then manifests itself; Kirk is reinstated to his former office and sent on a dangerous mission with his loyal crew only too happy to have him back. There are then a series of adventures, setbacks and plot-twists as the film-makers toy with the audience, keeping them in suspense as to who might be the real baddies and who are the good guys.This is a romping and thoroughly enjoyable action film which is full-on in its run of over 2 hours and never allows any lull in proceedings. This is augmented by terrific CGI special effects, as you would expect. Don't expect to be bored at any stage of this visually spectacular film.But it fails to make the transition to 'classic of its genre'. The film's main weakness is the casting of Chris Pine as Captain Kirk. That he is easy on the eye is pretty much beyond dispute, but therein lies the problem. He does not convey the inner gravitas for the role he plays here. You can't understand how he could have risen to command in the first place, let alone been considered worthy of reinstatement following being stripped of that status. It's not helped either that were he to get in a fisticuffs with Justin Bieber, you'd be hard-pressed to know who you'd put your money on. The producers clearly want him to develop a Butch and Sundance style partnership with offsider Spock – the highly effective Zachary Quinto. But it's not working. I have no wish to be unnecessarily harsh on him – he has previously acted well, convincing as the feckless son in Bottle Shock. I just feel he needs a few grey hairs and some laughter lines, an indication that he's lived life and known disappointment.Benedict Cumberbatch has a clear run as the arch-villain John Harrison/Khan. He is flawless in his portrayal of an evil man seeking to wreck the world and stamp ruthlessly on anyone who prevents him from getting his own way. Still, Benedict went to Harrow School so I imagine that he was given the perfect education for such a role. (Yes I know that's a little unfair – Churchill went there too). Simon Pegg returns as Scotty and is given a series of one-liners which were a little over-laboured and failed in the cinema I attended to raise much of a laugh. Zoe Saldana also returns as the headstrong Lieutenant Uhura and interacts well with Spock with whom she is romantically involved.Take a couple of glasses of wine into the cinema when you go and see this film and you should enjoy it greatly.",Star Trek Into Darkness
332,dukevega,Beyond Darkness Lies...Nothing,3,20 May 2013,"Those who know me have heard umpteen times my saying about original ideas in the movies. This is particularly true when doing a reboot/remake/sequel; you have a universe that has already been set up, now how do you give the audience something different while still playing within the limits of that universe? The Star Trek reboot I thought was one that got it right, and if that wasn't enough, they reset the universe in such a way that they could pretty much do whatever they wanted.And what did they do with this opportunity? They lamely ripped off a previous entry in the franchise, threw in some glaring logic holes and a preachy message, while producer/director J.J. Abrams forced some hammy overacting out of the villain.LAME RIP-OFFSThe previous entry they ripped off was ""Star Trek II: Wrath of Khan"", and they ripped off the ending, but only swapped the roles between Kirk and Spock, and if that wasn't enough, Spock screams Khan's name after Kirk dies, just Kirk did when Khan taunted him in the original.LOGIC ERRORSHow does an armed ship fly up to Starfleet Headquarters and proceed to blow away a meeting of admirals? Where's security (especially since it occurred right after a ""terrorist"" attack)?How does Scotty manage to fly into an enemy base by pulling the old ""Let's Blend in with the Drones"" trick? Where's their security?THEME PROBLEMSThe ""terrorist attack"" clearly parallels the terrorist situation of today and so we're clubbed over the head with a debate on how to respond to them. I know this debate will never end, and I can see both sides of this issue, but did the writers have to be so blatant about it? This was the reason I hated ""Avatar"" so much, but at least this movie only hit us over the head twice.HAMMY OVERACTINGBefore this movie, I had never heard of Benedict Cumberbatch, the actor playing the villain. I then saw him in a BBC TV series ""Sherlock"" (an example of a reboot done right), and could see he was the right man for the job. In the trailers, he oozed menace out of the simplest lines like ""Now, shall we begin?"". That was clearly his best line, because the rest of his deliveries were so hammy I was waiting for some eggs to show up.RECOMMENDATIONSAs I previously mentioned, BBC's ""Sherlock"", a modern-day update of the one-man CSI lab, is an example of a remake done right. Benedict owns the role, and the writers really challenged the character while still staying faithful to the spirit of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.Another good remake was ""Assassination of a High School President"", which took a well-known noir film and remade it into a teen film (it's good, trust me).",Star Trek Into Darkness
333,regula1,"Good Sci-fi movie, Okay Star Trek movie...from a purist.",8,24 May 2013,"When I say that I am a purist, I mean that I am a bigger fan of Star Trek before JJ Abrams, aka the 5 series and 10 movies that came before. When Star Trek (2009) came out, I saw potential to re-imagine the series while still continuing the legacy built by its predecessors.With Into Darkness, though, it seemed like they have gone a bit too far away from Star Trek's roots. True, there are several instances where true Trekkers like myself can see a connection to previous series and movies and get the context behind it. For example, there is a line of models that show the line of Enterprises up to the re-imagined NCC-1701.However, the main reason why I feel that this movie falls too far from its roots is its fairly dark themes that tend to contradict the base premise of Gene Roddenberry's Star Trek. If anyone has seen the documentary ""How William Shatner Changed the World"", they argue that Star Trek started to 'die' in the early 2000s because it had gone too far away from the Utopian image that was presented in The Original Series that gave so many people hope for the future. In my opinion, this is what has happened with Into Darkness.That being said, as a sci-fi action film it does stellar. JJ Abrams and his team have successfully translated the futuristic feel of Star Trek into somewhat plausibility with respect to the technology shown, and the action sequences are epic. I recommend anyone seeing this watch Star Trek II, III, VI, and Insurrection before or after. It will enhance the experience.",Star Trek Into Darkness
334,jmoney-2,Enjoyable but ultimately misguided,6,18 May 2013,"Star Trek Into Darkness The second installment of J.J. Abrams' alternate universe Star Trek series is the most action-packed in the history of the franchise but it may also turn out to be one of the most divisive. While ""Star Trek Into Darkness"" is well made, well acted, well written and enjoyable, it is also ultimately misguided.As the film opens, the young James T. Kirk (Chris Pine) is still experiencing growing pains when it comes to commanding a starship. Kirk will do anything to protect his space-faring family, even if it means sometimes violating sacred Starfleet rules and lying on official reports. He's proud of the fact he hasn't lost a single member of his crew. But what Kirk doesn't understand is, he can't truly become the leader he needs to be until he's ready to face death.The plot kicks into motion when a terrorist (the terrific Benedict Cumberbatch) attacks Starfleet installations in London and San Francisco (this episode spends so much time on the home planet that it could almost be called ""Earth Trek""). Kirk and the rest of the crew of the U.S.S. Enterprise are sent to track down the terrorist and take him out with long range, unmanned weapons. (Sound familiar?) But these drones, uh, I mean torpedoes, are not what they seem – nor is the terrorist they are aimed at. It is difficult to say much more about the plot without giving too much away, but the story leads to a showdown with one of the greatest enemies the Enterprise ever faced. While the events of Abrams' Trek movies occur in an alternate time-line, it seems certain events are predetermined to occur – certain foes are destined to be faced – though not in the same way, and not with the same outcomes.The movie is visually dazzling and has many fun moments. A sequence involving a high-speed spacewalk through a debris field looks amazing in IMAX 3D. But in the end, the movie is too derivative. The last film satisfied a thirst by returning the characters we loved, but at the same time, sent them on a new adventure. This movie takes the characters we are very familiar with and runs them through a plot we've mostly seen before, albeit with some clever twists. If we want to see the old characters in an old story – we can pop in an old DVD and watch the original cast do it better. Next time, I hope the new versions of old crew boldly go somewhere their characters haven't been before.",Star Trek Into Darkness
335,aldebaran68,The humour and personality of ST:TOS conspicuously absent...,4,12 May 2020,"I'm 65. I grew up with ST;TOS. I grew up with Bill Shatner as J. T. Kirk, Leonard Nimoy as Spock and Deforest Kelly as Bones McCoy...
I also grew up with the, yes, dodgy sets and strangely amateur Special Effects of the era. mid 60s, i think. I still have all the original series + movies on DVD.
I thought I'd try out the 'modern version'. The Prequel. On Netflix. Why not?
Ok, the cast are different. Well, they would have to be wouldn't they? The Special Effects are more in evidence and CGI'd. OK I can accept that...
So, why 4/10? The first thing i didn't like was the Romulans. Yes they are the baddies, but in the 60s/70s they were comic strip, laughable baddies. OTT baddies who looked ridiculous and were fun to 'boo and hiss' at. These Romulans look like they came out of Alcatraz or maybe Bosnia 90s, or maybe S. American drug syndicates. I wouldn't want to watch any movie where the baddies are so grim and vicious/evil/nasty looking. Quite horrendous, and off-putting.
2nd thing. There Is No Humour...Anywhere. Why Not? Despite the dodgy sets and SE of TOS, the chemistry and interactions between Kirk, Spock, and McCoy were priceless. The subtle humour, the innuendos, the wisecracking... It was glorious! The best interaction on TV. Then Scotty would join in. It was the greatest fun entertainment and it was enlightening.
Now, there is not a trace of humour anywhere. Nothing. It's all run at the speed of the 100 metres race. Everything is shouted at top speed and top volume. why? What is the point?
After 50 mins of this I gave up. For me this bears abs No resemblance to the beloved ST:TOS of the 60s to 90s. It's a frenetic mindless depersonalised screen event created for a 21C generation that apparently knows no better.
Such a shame that they couldn't do ST:TOS the honour of keeping its soul intact. But ten maybe the 21C has forgotten soul in its quest to become cyborged... This ST; Into darkness is just one outcome of that trend.I shall keep to my ST:TOS DVDs. Thank you.",Star Trek Into Darkness
336,sedativchunk,"Wonderful Star Trek movie that any fan, old or new, should watch!",9,17 May 2013,"I felt the need to write an honest (spoiler-free) review for this movie as I see a lot of hate for it. I'm a fan of yesterdays Trek; Shater/Nimoy, Picard, Voyager, DS9, Enterprise I absolutely love the old Star Trek universe. Coming into the first film in 2009 I was very open minded about it as I am a true Star Trek fan (I even went to my first convention this year in Philadelphia) and will watch the films regardless of them replacing the original actors. Although the 2009 film was a pretty good film and I agreed with the new cast, it did not satisfy my liking in rebooting the franchise. I wasn't crazy about the storyline and overall the film just fell a bit short of what I thought it should have been. Despite the negatives, I still enjoyed the 2009 film. With that being said, I absolutely had to see the sequel ""Into Darkness"". Today I went on to the U.S. release of ST:ID. I have to say, the entire movie was extremely engaging from beginning to end! There is not one second where I ever sat back and was disgusted or bored with any part of the movie. J.J. Abrams stepped up his game and delivered a true Star Trek movie this time around that should please fans both old and new!ST:ID takes place in the near future after the events of the 2009 film. Captain Kirk is now commanding the Enterprise and adventuring when a new enemy threatens the entire existence of Starfleet Command. I have to say as a fan there is not enough good things I can say about this film. The storyline, characters, even the sound effects on the bridge, it pays great homage to the Star Trek of yesterday while still being a fresh, new film. From beginning to end, we see plenty of Star Trek goodness. Lot's of starfleet command, meetings with admirals, a scene where a tribble is involved in some medical experiments, and even a very awesome scene where we see models of the first warp-capable ship from ""Star Trek: First Contact"" and the NX- 01 Enterprise from ""Star Trek Enterprise"" (a wonderful Easter egg/cameo for any real Star Trek fan). Also, not a spoiler, but we get a brief scene with the legendary one and only Leonard Nimoy reprising his role as Spock again! Lastly we see some other nice background stories finally started/told as well, like Carol Marcus, Kirks former lover from ""The Wrath of Khan"". One thing I absolutely loved about this film was the fact that it is going back to the ""story telling"" roots of Star Trek. This movie has almost the perfect blend of stunning CGI while still having those classic one on one conversations between characters. J.J. Abrams camera work was also much better. Less moving/wobbling camera effects, less off-centered camera angles, and dare I say... much less lens flares! The villain was also much better this time. Instead of a ridiculous looking, angry, tattooed Romulan (that I have sadly say poorly tied in with the Star Trek universe), we get a very sinister, mysterious, and menacing villain. Without spoiling the movie I will say old school Star Trek fans will be pleased to know who he is! This is easily in the top two best Star Trek films of all time. One of the very few, very minor pet peeves I had with this film which is why I didn't give it a 10 star rating is this. Mr. Scott and Chekov (among others) had relatively awkward/strange roles in the film that I won't spoil. To put it in other words, there was just a very strange balance of on-screen time for characters at times which is why I docked one star from this review. My second main reason is, although the story was good, I think it borrowed just a bit too much from another classic Star Trek movie who's name I will not say. These minor pet peeves of mine, however, are very small and easily tolerated. The rest of the film was excellent and definitely worth the price of admission.Overall this was an excellent Star Trek film. Whether you are a newcomer to Star Trek, an old schooler, or something in between, I think this movie has something to make everyone happy. Without getting into details, many old school fans who claim they are ""true fans"" of ST bash this movie greatly. I will say as a fan myself there is absolutely nothing wrong with J.J. Abrams, the new Star Trek universe, or any other parts of it. This is a great film and if you give the new cast a chance and sit back and enjoy the film, I promise you will like it!",Star Trek Into Darkness

339,stephenrtod,Connoiseurs May Relish This Trek,9,21 May 2013,"Connoisseurs of ""Star Trek"" may fall in love again with tribbles and Khan Noonian-Singh. Those not familiar with Star Trek will still enjoy this stand-alone story which doesn't even require the audience to recall the first of J. Abrams' resurrections, with much the same acting crew, in 2009.I first watched James Tiberius Kirk, Mr. Spock, Dr. Bones McCoy, Scotty, Lt. Uhura, Mr. Sulu and Chekhov, go where no man or woman had gone before, back in 1966. I get as much of a kick out of this movie.The pilot of the first Star Trek series, a two-part episode entitled ""The Menagerie,"" starred Jeffrey Hunter as Captain Christopher Pike. With his sapphire-blue eyes and charismatic personality, Hunter had been successful earlier playing Jesus Christ in ""King of Kings."" Bruce Greenwood fleshes out what Commander Pike was truly like before his injury depicted 47 years ago in Roddenberry's first stab at creating the Federation.William Shatner was an up-and-coming young actor who had achieved considerable fame in Stratford Ontario, acting in quite an array of the Bard's histories, comedies, tragedies and romances. Shatner had been impressive in such films as ""Judgment at Nuremburg,"" ""The Brothers Karamazov"" and ""The World of Suzi Wong."" Christopher Pike in the current reboot has to be Kirk, believably, without being Shatner.Even to attempt to recapture the imagery, the cadence and the poignancy of those early shows would be very daunting. For director Abrams to meld numerous fan-favorite characters, themes and scenes, producing one of the best Star Trek films I have seen, is truly admirable.Karl Urban's tone, pace, his Southern accent, even his body language and timing, channel DeForrest Kelly's Dr. McCoy, right down to the doctor's paranoia about technology, especially the idea of his molecules being discorporated, then recorporated, when he is asked to ""beam down."" The Chief Engineer doing most of the beaming down, Commander Montgomery Scott, is re-imagined by Simon Pegg, who takes Scott where James Doohan, the original Scotty, had not gone before, making Scott just as important in several scenes as any of the principal characters. Both Scott and Uhura figure prominently into the resolution of the many tangled webs in the plot in ways that Doohan and Nichelle Nichols, the original Uhura, would be proud, and maybe even more than a little envious, of.Zachary Quinto's interpretation of the young Mr. Spock is breathtakingly like the Spock that Trekkies know and love, yet Quinto makes that character his own, as well, newly-minted. The brief impressive cameo by Leonard Nimoy, himself, is tantamount to a Vulcan mind-meld between the older and younger actor. Quinto's acting skills somehow both recapitulate and reinvent those of his predecessor.Chris Pine is not William Shatner. Somehow, however, Pine manages to act more headstrong, more impulsive, and even more of an outrageous maverick who seems to think that rules are like candy canes to be crunched and swallowed or spat out, before reinventing new procedures that defy the Prime Directive to solve thorny galactic conundrums.This movie cranks. With a running time of about two hours, there is no lull, no dead space, no time for your adrenalin to abate even a little. At several points, the suspense was almost unbearable, when I could not imagine how the entire crew might escape certain death.Abrams, who has also produced ""Lost"" and ""Super 8,"" is at the top of his form.The cinematography is extraordinary, accentuating, amplifying and delineating scenes and moments like a Greek chorus.Generally speaking, the Academy Award Committee turns a blind eye toward science fiction films, but it is just possible that they may make an exception in terms of the way this movie was filmed.The great scientist, Sir Arthur C. Clark, warned 53 years ago in ""Profiles in the Future,"" that ""Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic."" That's how I felt watching this movie. These professional pretenders produced one believable illusion after another. Cognizant of brilliant benchmarks that went before, movies like ""Alien,"" Abrams has created a movie that can stand up to the great ones.Most amazingly, Abrams has created a Star Trek movie that does not require its audience to remember Ricardo Montalban in ""Space Seed,"" or Roddenberry's ""Star Trek III,"" both of which this movie powerfully alludes to.The suspense and excitement actually accelerate as the movie flows along. That is rare. Abrams and crew are to be praised as artists who care about their craft and their legacy. In Hollywood, that is extremely rare. To attempt to enrapture Trekkies, Trekkers, and the uninitiated -takes guts.",Star Trek Into Darkness

341,tfc,Star Trek into sadness. This reboot crashed my Isolinear systems and how to fix it.,7,25 March 2016,"*Spoiler Alert*
I finally got around to this review after three years because several items still have not really been addressed by other reviews. Originally I saw STID as a good film with fixable flaws but as time has passed, I now watch STID with ever deepening sadness which dampens my enjoyment of other Star Trek productions knowing that anything can be hijacked and taken to the chop shop. In short I expected more and believe that 90% of STID flaws and extra overhead boils down to sledge hammering ""Khan Noonien Singh"" as the villain into the ""the plot"". The reason for this overturning of nearly 50 years of Trek cannon makes me wonder if anyone was really in control because there should have been some issues raised but others can debate this ad nauseam. My fix for STID is a product recall. Admit there are problems and reedit STID to better fit Trek cannon and the series genre as a whole thus making STID better (IMMHO). It should also be ""cheap"" to do a recall since they are making another Trek movie and they could shoot a few new scenes to add to STID. Not only that, the sales of the revamped movie should probably be profitable since every Trek fan would want to see the changes and buy a copy. We could also have endless fun discussions about who shot whom first (Star Wars).Suggested changes to STID:Several other IMDb reviews have repeatedly made numerous suggestions that would greatly improve STID and so will not be rehashed here.Harrison: Drop the Khan bit and just keep the Seymour ""John"" Harrison character. Harrison should be just a 300 year old augment uber engineer who was the head engineer for Khan Noonien Singh (i.e. Albert Speer in WWII, Khan's ""Scotty""). 300 years ago when Khan and his management team were launched into space (i.e. Space Seeds) Harrison and his engineering crew of 72 decided to stay on earth and sleep until Khan's return. As a side plot you could have Harrison claiming to be ""Khan"" as to hide from Kirk the fact that his crew of engineers launched Khan into deep space and want to cover their tracks by claiming to be the feared augment leadership (just a thought). The reason Harrison and his crew were covertly awakened by Section 31 was to develop prohibited weapons and immoral tactics that no modern ethical Starfleet engineer would come within a light year of creating. Section 31 had an untraceable augment engineering crew who would do as they pleased and would not let ""Starfleet principles"" slow their pace preparing for the coming war. The problem started when the projects were finishing up, Section 31 started to refreeze Harrison's team but Harrison had plans to usurp Section 31 and continue the augment master plan (Khan's plan). This is when he made his break, blew up the labs, and took off. Despite all the evidence that augments have more strength, speed, and drive, he still is lacking something and this drives Harrison even more to drive a Mac truck through everything.Dr. Leonard McCoy: Once Bones finds out that Harrison is a 300 year old augment, he gleefully goes out of his way to let Harrison know what backwards inhuman freaks of nature the augments are. Harrison loathes Bones after the several times Bones turned Harrison into a pile of mush using modern childhood illnesses or medical tests to prove that augments are not superior. Bones then modernizes Harrison's weird immune system so Harrison can function outside the lab (Section 31 used this weakness to keep Harrison and his crew on a short leash). Along the way Bones creates a novel way to tweak the augment's stem cells to repair illnesses in others although modern medicine uses synthetic versions. Harrison is Bone's plaything and Harrison would like to pitch bone's head off if he didn't need him... for now.Scotty: Scotty looks at Harrison's work and laughs. All Harrison's engineering crew did was made things bigger and meaner but not stable enough for Starfleet standards (sloppy and amateurish). This instability allowed Scotty to quickly turn the Dreadnaught in to a pile of quivering mush with a ""small screwdriver"". Harrison learns quickly why certain weapons were not developed by Starfleet engineering.Spock: Spock looks at Harrison like he is a primitive Vulcan. Harrison picks up that he is still ""merely a human and found wanting"" and Spock's sister (if he had one) hits harder. Spock would demonstrate that the augment's penchant for aggression to solve problems does not well work in Vulcan games. Augments cannot build ships in a bottle or do anything slow. The fact that Spock armed the photon torpedoes and had them beamed on to the Dreadnaught showed Harrison who was really in control.Spock Prime: Still cannot see the need for him, but with a few tweaks this scene could still ""work"".Kirk: I would leave him alone and continue to serve as Harrison's punching bag.That's about it for the major plot points the rest could fill additional pages and since this is likely a moot exercise, ends here.",Star Trek Into Darkness
342,SerpentMage,Split Opinion...,5,27 May 2013,"Let's remove the title of this movie and just call it Into Darkness. And let's say that there is a captain, first officer and they are in space. If you do that, this movie is a 10. However, it is a movie in the sign of the times like a Transformer movie. Don't get me wrong I enjoy a Transformer movie like the rest. However, the problem is that this movie is like Miami Vice of the 80's. Namely cool at the time, and looking back a bit douchy.This movie is not a Magnum PI type of movie. I have asked many people, even young people who never grew up on Magnum PI when it was released. And they all tell me, Magnum is pretty cool. What makes Magnum different, and some parts of Star Trek past, is its ability to be timeless.Here is a little bit of Trivia. When William Shatner took on the role of Star Trek captain how old was he? Don't read further! When Chris Pine took on the role of Star Trek captain how old was he? Answer Shatner was 34 and Pine was 28. YET even now Pine looks like a college boy, and not as a man as a captain should be. Most people when they do the math do not realize that Shatner was only 34 years old as people tend to believe he was in his 40's.Therein lies the entire difference of this Star Trek movie. The captain is a college boy and not a man. So therefore if you don't care about the Star Trek ideals then yeah this movie like Miami Vice is actually pretty cool. But if you want Magnum PI you are not going to get it, and therein lies my reason for this rating. I wanted Magnum, not Miami Vice. I can get Miami Vice from the Transformers.",Star Trek Into Darkness

Why even try to recreate Kahn? Ricardo Montalbans villain portrayal is one of the best in movie history. It's kinda like a band covering a #1 hit song. You can't do it any better than the original or expect it to be better than #1. Why even try? The special effects where great and the movie was somewhat entertaining, but I hate it when Hollywood takes a series and twists it around and doesn't stick to the original knowns.

344,anderbilt,A Fine Movie among a selection of Fine Movies in Star Trek,7,20 May 2013,"I write this as a fan from the first wave of Star Trek fans, who first thrilled to the teaser commercials NBC ran on TV in the summer of 1966. Back in that day we could not have imagined what was in store for us in that tantalizing bit of sci-fi with a quick Enterprise flyby, Shatner leaping with his phaser, and Gary Lockwood's glowing visage taking a direct blast. I write this: WHAT A SPECTACLE OF A MOVIE. Outstanding. Engaging characters, a vicious villain and a real sense of peril. I won't post spoilers, but I will advise any fan of Star Trek to see the movie. I'm a constant lover and fan of all the Star Trek TV franchises, and I've been mildly to moderately annoyed with every one of the movies, but for the same general reasons; that movies by their nature are subject to complex and flawed assembly and writing, overly simplistic and broad performance, and sad to say a constant sense that what you see is so over-calculated for effect, rather than springing naturally from an engaging story. Against this presumption, Star Trek Into Darkness does not fail more, and in fact succeeds much more, than the previous Star Trek movies as an interesting and watchable film. I would post instead my general list of annoyances, for what they're worth. 1. Comment for JJ Abrams - too much borrowing from existing ST and past movies ... the promise was for something new to emerge from the reboot 2. Another comment for JJ Abrams - too much reliance on Star Wars sci-fi parlance and imagery, and perhaps not enough attention to what basic conventions specific to Star Trek should survive and apply past a sweeping time-incursion reboot of the franchise. I wouldn't be the first to advise Mr Abrams of the zero-sum net effect of discarding expected conventions up front, only to borrow from past story lines anyway. I think the vast demographic appeal-demands of the movie medium makes it a harder place to try and tell a story with sufficient nuance and complexity. The previous movie series presumed the conventions of the TV series, but glossed over it for the movie-viewer and casual fan.

For non fans it explains the relationship between Kirk and Spock, and it shows how the smart farm boy matures into Captain Kirk.

My advise to fans is not to read reviews, and see it and live it. To non fans, welcome aboard. This is a ride you will not want to get off of. And this is a good way to rediscover this classic.

347,bobcolganrac,"Brilliant At Times, Overblown At Others",7,17 May 2013,"It seems the people associated with the legacy of Gene Roddenberry can never find the power themselves ""to go where no man has gone before"" (which sounds awfully sexist even as I write it)....Many of the Star Treks are only rehashes of previous Star Trek shows, or rehashes of Star Trek movies, or rehashes of rehashes of either----a common theme to Star Trek movie scripts. This one's no different. And, it's not only a rehash of previous Star Treks, but it also rips off key plot from another movie, K-19 The Widowmaker.I truly loved 2009's Star Trek movie (NOTE: perhaps the one true exception to the lack of novelty which afflicts the ST genre) which introduced us to the young persona of the TV show cast. It was an excellent movie, though there were times when it stretched credibility. One thing that a movie, even a fantasy sci-fi, ought to respect is biological limitations: when we see a person in a serious fight receiving numerous blows from objects, fists, feet, elbows----and then we see them with virtually NOTHING showing as damaged (no bruises, cuts, scrapes, swelling, etc)...it loses me. I really want some verisimilitude here. Any movie which involves physical harm should show the induced harm and unless there is some form of accelerated healing ---which is part of the cover story Star Trekkers will advance--- the sequelae of the fight ought to be as realistic as possible. Jack Nicholson's character had his nose cut in ""Chinatown"" and wore a misfitting face bandage for quite a while. It was appropriate, and it engendered more of a sympathy for his kindred humanity. The more we can identify with the sufferings of characters, the more we can feel for their travails....the more we can project ourselves vicariously into their travails.But ---when there is a terribly violent fight....and the person suddenly stands up and dusts themselves off and looks unscathed....the reality has been compromised at a very visceral level.I have two primary objections to this movie and both involve the extremely unrealistic nature of recovery after battle damage, both to the characters and to the vessels they occupy.I refuse to ever give out details that would constitute spoiler for those who haven't seen a movie, and I find myself constrained here to not say more than generalization. Which is too bad. It would be nice to take the real key scenes to which I most object and detail why they so offend. But I won't.On the very plus side we have some excellent acting. It is difficult to fault any of the acting in this movie, it's that good. Camera work is at times gorgeously beautiful. The opening sequence itself I thought glorious. The city scapes are the stuff of an architect's wet dreams. The CGI digital sequences flawlessly and seamlessly flow. I love the 3D for movies like this.Overall, what I felt was that the movie started very very well, moved to some very nice plot complications and maintained a high level of tension effectively for the viewer, but ended somewhat weakly-------had they been able to keep that same strength throughout the entirety of the movie I would have given it a 9....but because of the failure to observe simple biological boundaries, and because the plot attenuated toward the end I could only give it a 7. Liked it a lot, but didn't love it. Vastly preferred Star Trek (2010).",Star Trek Into Darkness

Which is ironic as the ""reboot"" had the advantage in every category. While the actors of Wrath are good, they were in reality, TV show actors with little film experience, while the stars of Darkness were mostly accomplished and recognized big name movie stars. Special effects had three decades to improve but while the effects of Wrath had a huge impact on the audience despite their limited budget, Darkness effects, with their vastly superior budget, feel flat and don't really add much to the story. The script of the original is no masterpiece and takes many liberties with science, but is at least believable. I forgot the plot to Darkness minutes after watching it. In the end I believe the problem lies with the director, Abrams, after all , he wrote Armageddon, nuff said.",Star Trek Into Darkness
349,gillies,A decent effort but needs more work.,4,22 June 2013,"This movie's storyline is not as tight as the storyline in Star Trek 10. There are serious flaws in the storyline that you could drive a Mack Truck through. In the original movie, the flaws were minor things, like forgetting your phasers when you space-jump onto an enemy platform with self-destruct orders. This movie violates the Star Trek Universe to a much greater extent (example : an alien space is penetrated deeply and with not even a trifle of an explanation as to how.)Star Trek movies always had a message, and Roddenbury was patient enough to hammer the message into the viewer's head, by having the main characters act dumb and ask questions until the viewer understood what was at stake. The original series also discussed the implications of the problem they were trying to solve, and they made it very clear.In this movie, the message gets lost in all the phaser battles, jumps from high places, blown up ships, death and destruction, etc.The only cute thing in this movie is that it has a different meaning if you're old enough to have seen the original source material upon which it is based. That is mildly interesting. But Star Trek movies are for the boomers and 50-65 year old set any more; they're for the kids, and even my kids noticed the flaws in this movie, ""Daddy, it wasn't as good as Iron Man"".Also, the important inter-relationship between Kirk, Spock, and McCoy is not played up as much as in Star Treks 1-10, or in any of the original series's episodes. Again, that's because too many things were being blown up, or people were having too many fistfights, and these things consumed nearly all of the screen time.",Star Trek Into Darkness
350,magicsinglez,Closer to Gene Roddenberry's original vision? This movie has a heart.,8,6 June 2013,"The title Star Trek Into Darkness is misleading. The trailer, too, leads one to believe this is a tale of revenge. And this film features Khan. The film Star Trek II is dedicated to Khan's obsession with revenge. In one scene, released to the public before the movies premier, Captain Pike tells Captain Kirk something like, ""The Federation isn't about personal vendettas"". Captain Kirk replies, ""Maybe it should be"".Instead what Captain Kirk learns, pretty much on his own, perhaps as a continuation of the end of the first film Star Trek 2009, is that justice is not about revenge. Human life isn't his to take. At least not in cold blood. Leonard Nimoy appears again in this film and he also provides a firm sense of moral grounding. Nimoy's performance here is not solely about bringing Vulcan sensibilities to the part? Surely we are seeing something of the real Leonard Nimoy in his performance. Nimoy would title his second autobiography, ""I am Spock"". Bringing something of his real character and morals to his performance in Into Darkness is why it's so meaningful, it's real. In the previous film, the Romulan Captain Nero destroys Spock's home world, in a quest for revenge of a sort. All the elder Spock can say about Nero, after pausing to think about it, is that Nero is 'troubled' as if he's concerned about Nero. The ending of this film, at least Kirk's medical recovery, leads one to wonder if perhaps Khan might return.As other reviewers have noted, this film sails closer to Gene Roddenberry's 'humanistic vision'. Whether it's been made under the influence of Roddenberry or not, this film has a proverbial heart.We also learn that friendship is more important than truth. For Spock, who cannot tell a lie, this is something he will learn, or be corrupted by, over a lifetimes worth of experience. When captain Kirk falsifies a report to Star Fleet, I was kind of hoping the lesson to be learned would be one about the importance of being truthful, but instead we're learning about the importance of friendship. And also that friends believe different things than we do and sometimes live in different ways than we do, but we should still be committed to them. It's what gives life meaning?In a Star Trek episode from the original series, 'The Enterprise Incident', Spock does lie, convincing a Roluman Captain that he's defecting from Star Fleet. He's actually on a spy mission. He uses the fact that it's known Vulcan's cannot lie against this female captain. When she discovers the deception, Spock confesses that, ""I was not unmoved"" by this woman's advances. In one of the more famous episodes from the original serious, 'Mirror, Mirror' the crew are errantly beamed aboard an Enterprise that exists in an alternate universe where the Federation is an 'Empire' that rules by maintaining terror. When captain Kirk is talking to his concubine on the evil ship, a woman who's figured out something is wrong, captain Kirk tells her, ""you're the captains woman until he says you're not"". He plans on finding his way back to his own Enterprise.I think I enjoyed the first film more, Star Trek 2009. Perhaps it was the joy of seeing these characters in action once again, because that movie had a, pardon the phrase, illogical plot. There was more dialog, I think, especially between the characters, in the film 2009. This new film has a heart.",Star Trek Into Darkness

I haven't escaped the feeling that the new folks aren't acting like actors of the original TV series. Another feeling that bothers me is the attempt to make these new movies slick and dramatic when the original was far-out and cheesy. Anyways, the actual movie was an enjoyable story. A little terrorism, twists and turns. Sacrifice must be made, real emotions and conflict for Kirk and the gang. Very nice. The incorporation of the old cast movie story lines was also a very nice tip of the cap to die hard trekies. J.J. is truly a fan and I think that shows in this work.A bit much with the explosions and dangling from this saucer and that cliff and beaming at the last moment and opening the door just in time so we don't smash into it when sky diving through outer space into a garbage shoot and stopping the bomb before it blows, etc...

This was the happiest I've been with the franchise since the first Wrath of Khan! The cast has settled in nicely for a WILD ride. Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto, as Kirk and Spock, respectively, are far more nuanced this go-around. The look of the film is excellent and all supporting cast passable to very good. I know the action wasn't REALLY nonstop, but it seemed to be. The writing - the old switcheroo in the script - was massively clever. My only disappointment was that Benedict Cumberbatch didn't have more screen time. He is mesmerizing every time he's on.

Incredible lack of imagination on show here, not that I could see much beyond the flares going off (Seriously, no one would be able to work on that bridge without sunnies). Perhaps either Spock could explain the logic of ripping off scenes that fans adore and will be annoyed by, just to show the same things to a bunch of people who couldn't care less? Certain story lines work because they are handled with care and because audiences have invested time in the characters. This crew, as yet, mean nothing to me. I've never had a chance to care for them because they spend most of the time running or jumping long distances. The emotions only work if you think back to the original films and that bridge is too wide. You can't tear up what went before and then expect to trade on the pieces. Aside from the names involved this iteration shares almost none of the DNA or ideals of the original series, and just sticking in a few references to the Prime Directive does not change that. And just how crap was the Peter Weller character? He might as well have started talking slang. P.S. Don't be surprised to find out Chewbacca is a wookiesexual and 3PO turns out to have been infused with the Emporer's DNA in Ep. 7.

Really, I can't believe they took on this story, they could have ended this series here & now but it's so Entertaining & well structured that even a Star Trek fan like me can only applaud the audacity of playing out this story.It's Fun with a capital F...brilliantly paced with some truly gorgeous shots of the USS Enterprise. There's some interesting twists & surprises and it features a super villain :-) in the form of Benedict Cumberbatch.A wonderfully political film with sensational action set-pieces (the likes of which ""A Good Day to Die Hard"" can only dream of)The picture starts of with a brilliant James Bond type pre-title sequence with a nice fun nod to ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" and I love the resolution to this early encounter & what the aliens inhabitants scrawl in the sand...Kirk was always disobeying the prime directive (do not interfere with other civilisations...yeah right!) Then comes the set-up for the film with a dying girl...after this it's wonderful scenes of fun, action & political discussion / tactics.A well known race shows up (looking a little different but I liked 'em) after Kirk & co try try set up a meeting with them but which ends up in a fun space chase (JJ's gonna love playing with the Millienium Falcon, although I still think the Enterprise is the better looking ship)We have a terrorist attack on Starfleet, a space suit flight that is thrilling & an interesting Space Battle / Stand-Off resulting in some truly epic shots of the Enterprise in trouble and we have Spock sprinting through the streets phaser drawn...this sounds simple and it is but it's thrilling.I love we got to hear Alexander Courage's TV theme at the end of the film setting up the 5 year mission to boldly go where no one has gone before.There will always be JJ haters (the lens flares are nearly always mentioned but it's pretty much his signature now, although i'm hoping we get just the 1 or 2 in the new Star Wars film & we know what they should be right? a light-saber suddenly appearing perhaps being wielded by someone surprising? and a bright sun suddenly glaring due to the Millienium Falcon flying out from it with Han on his way to save the day)Star Trek: Into Darkness is a very well made film that Entertains all the way.This cast is just Brilliant...An adventure like this every 2 or 3 years is OK with me.Chris Pine is Kirk (I never thought Shatner could be surpassed) Zachary Quinto is spock Karl Urban is Dr McCoy (great quips here but it would be nice to set the 3 of them interact more like in the TV series) Simon Pegg is scotty (and he's brilliant & fun here) Zoe Saldana is Uhura (and sorry but that tight fitting costume she's wearing early on in the film is just sensational) John Cho is Sulu (superb moments piloting the shuttle early on & then taking the Captain's chair) Anton Yelchin is Checkov and IS the guy who says ""Keptain on the Bridge""Alice Eve well you'll see, she's gorgeous & sensational & will be a fine addition to the crews future adventures.A mention should also go to Peter Weller who's brilliant.It was mentioned years ago that Star Trek might go the young Starfleet Academy route but I wasn't convinced, instead we've got a younger Kirk, McCoy & Spock and co heading into their 5 Year mission on the Big Screen and that thrills me. Yes it's not the Trek we all really remember on the TV screens & you may not like JJ's choices but cinematically it works perfectly.JJ will do well to get a cast this good for the next Star Wars.Paramount should sign them ALL up for at least another 3 more films as they are PERFECT together.BTW Just heard that the new Star Wars will be filmed in 35mm & that they are going old school with model sfx...done right, this is gonna be a nostalgic triumph!Another Super ""Star Trek"" film with an up up & away rating of 9/10.JJ Abrahams two Star Trek movies might not be as the original TV Series but boy do they make for GREAT & ENTERTAINING Movies.UPDATE: I've updated this review and changed the summary above to honour a young guy (a wonderful cast member of these JJ Trek films) ANTON YELCHIN who so sadly died yesterday. He was a GREAT, FUN 'Checkov' & I loved how he raced to save Kirk by using the transporter.He was brilliantly cast...they ALL have been brilliantly cast, they are the NEW CREW of the STARSHIP ENTERPRISE and I for one will dearly miss seeing him on the BIG screen engaging on more Missions (I really hope STAR TREK : BEYOND is a good 'un)",Star Trek Into Darkness
355,ivern-326-711636,Finally Stark Trek Has a Soul!,8,5 June 2013,"Star Trek: Into Darkness is the sequel to the overrated Stark Trek reboot from 2009. It's about how the Enterprise is sent on a mission to kill a terrorist who's been causing havoc in the city of London.To be honest, I wasn't even planning on seeing this movie in theaters. But the critics praised it, calling it the best movie of the year so far. Skeptical as I was, I still gave it a chance.Before I start rambling about Into Darkness, let's talk about the previous film. The previous film was a good movie with some likable characters and a good set-up. What it lacked, however, was a compelling story and an interesting villain.Is Star Trek: Into Darkness an improvement over the original? Hell yeah it is! This is hands down the best movie of the year so far! I was worried it'd be the same as The Dark Knight craze; fanboys blinded by the overly serious plot, but Star Trek: Into Darkness has enough humor to make it fun and enough drama to make you care about the characters.The writing in this movie is ten times better than the original. It's a lot faster-paced than the first movie, and the plot is actually interesting. On the surface, it's a very simple good vs. evil plot. But it's the characters that make this movie truly interesting. There's a lot more energy here than there was in the previous movie, and that makes the whole thing much more entertaining.Probably the biggest improvement from the first movie is the villain. I won't spoil too much about this guy. All I'm gonna say is he is so good. Sometimes he's a bit too over-the-top, but the moral dilemma he brings up makes him a believable villain, and not just some bad guy who does bad things.The main characters are much better this time around. Chris Pine as Kirk I've always liked, and he's just as good, if not better in this movie. Spock was a whiny and unlikable jerk in the first movie, but in this one he's a much better character who develops over-time. The rest of the characters have also seen improvements, and are all much more likable.Overall, Star Trek: Into Darkness is a great movie. If you're a filmmaker looking for inspiration to make a sequel, this is one of the movies you should take notes from. I'm not necessarily calling it one of the best sequels ever, but I am calling it one of the most improved sequels ever. If you are a Star Trek fan, chances are you'll LOVE this movie to death.

Most would say that this last two movie have to fit the story-line of the young Cpt. Kirk, but I would rather say this is an alternative beginning and an even better one that leads to a more heroic character.I believe that this is a whole new beginning for the Start Trek movies since they abandon the predictable and dull path that were revealed to us in the past. Fans may disagree, but you know what, ""change"" is good and it give way for a new type of fans to become part of this style.I give this movie 10/10 just because it has all the needed elements to make it great and make you wait for the next part of the voyage.",Star Trek Into Darkness

The spoiler being that no one is to know that Khan is the villain until the second half of the movie, and most Sci-fi fans knew the identity of the enemy from the previews. Judging this film on the poor characterization of two of the best villains in Sci-fi history, however, would be giving a half-billion dollar production a pass.No, this is a film that likes Kligons for their looks, and Khan for his action moves. How closely the Federation's actions are to the Kligons is never debated. What the implications of the Genetics War were to a new war mongering society were also swept under the rug. But again, that's back to old Star Trek...What does this film have to offer to the Sci-Fi genre? Not much. Most of the scenes revolve around hair raising events, and how risky they are to the human body - such as the volcano sequence in the first part of the film. This is a good beginning. Too many times, all films show these daring do stunts that no human can survive. But instead of delving into a situation in which science is used to upgrade the human body, the filmmakers instead just bring in Khan as the answer. Never do any of the War capable Federation members ask if this creation could save federation soldiers lives as they fight however many wars they fight. They just think this will be a great distraction for Kligons?(Also, this alternate universe was supposed to have been created 28 years prior to this film, whereas the Botany Bay - Khan's ship - was supposed to have set sail about 280 years prior, and was to be in unexplored space. The film never mentions how the Federation was supposed to have picked up his ship.) It's obvious the film maker doesn't have any feel for these stories. It might have been interesting to blow up Vulcan, or make Kirk a problem child, but science fiction actually has to have some science dilemma. Remake Die Hard, Walking Tall or The Bourne series.

I must say, it's quite interesting that it too that long to bring forth a follow up, but were the four years worth the wait to see the further adventures of James T. Kirk and the crew of the USS Enterprise? You bet your bottom dollar! I personally think this sequel was superior to the first and delivered some of the finest moments in all of Star Trek. This film also paid homage to the Star Trek of yesteryear and revamped one of the franchise's most famous adversaries, the tyrannical superhuman Khan Noonien Singh. But we don't find out he is Khan until about half way through the film.

It is also revealed that Khan's blood has enhanced platelets that can cure almost any illness, foil any ailment or revive dead tissue. I loved the way Benedict Cumberbatch portrayed Khan, paying homage to the great Ricardo Montalban on several occasions but also bringing something new to the famous Trek baddie. He also has a magnificent, overpowering voice that's very reminiscent to Patrick Stewart, adding a bit of sinisterness and malevolence to an already malevolent villain. ""No ship should go down without her captain!""Returning from the previous film are of course Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto as Kirk and Spock respectively. The other crew members of the Enterprise also return and a new blondie named Carol Marcus joins the band, but Kirk and Spock are front and center and are the film's main focus. The relationship between the two is the film's best element. The relationship between Kirk and Spock is the highlight of any Star Trek episode or movie, but in this film, you can really see how these two characters relate to one another or get at each other's throats in certain perils. Kirk is also annoyed by Spock's logical statements and beliefs, giving the film a teaspoon of comic relief and humor only available through human and Vulcan association. Speaking of comic relief, Mccoy, Scotty and Chekov get a lot of funny moments in the film. Uhura of course shows off her skills as communications officer while chatting with a Klingon and Sulu shows off his gallant command skills while hunting down Khan. And once Khan is aboard the Enterprise, he relentlessly taunts Kirk about killing his crew and how he is better at ""everything"". I love the way Khan sees right through Kirk and knows what will bring Kirk to his knees. He surely knew what would take Kirk down in The Wrath of Khan, which is one of the many reasons why it is many Trekkies' favorite Star Trek flick. I should also mention the great performance of Peter Weller (aka Robocop) as the secondary villain, Admiral Marcus, who comes off as a pompous string puller who believes a war is coming and that all should be prepared for it's consequences. The plot of the film is different from most Trek flicks, but it still has that Star Trek feeling if you ask me and brings in a lot of elements from the movies, TV shows and even the animated series to make a slushy of awesomeness. I do believe Star Trek Into Darkness is my favorite of the 12 Star Trek films, from it's Indiana Jones inspired opening to it's Wrath of Khan inspired ending. I hope JJ can crank out one more Star Trek flick before setting his coordinates to Star Wars Episode 7, but one can never be too sure. Into Darkness was certainly a sequel worth waiting for and a great love letter to Roddenberry's brainchild.It also has a spectacular cameo by Leonard Nimoy. That alone makes the film worth going to see at warp speed.",Star Trek Into Darkness
362,Josh_The_Third,"Good actors, not-so-good writing",5,13 June 2013,"Before I get to the bad news, let me say that the cast in this movie is good. As in the last movie, the Spock and Kirk characters are convincing, and so is Khan A.K.A Benedict Cumberbatch. Anybody who has seen the modern Sherlock Holmes series knows he is a superb actor.However..the dialogue and plot of this movie don't let Cumberbatch and the other guys really do anything interesting. The script is VERY cliché' but also neurotically fast-paced.Between all the chases and ""unpredictable"" twists, it feels like there's no ""flesh"", no intellect to ""Into Darkness"". The last movie was sort of light-weight too but this time around, the audience expected to find new depths to the characters. Instead of that happening, they all turn into caricatures which you won't care about once the credits roll.This is quite a shame, especially considering the intelligence of the original Star Trek series. Also, Cumberbatch's talent is much broader than what you see in this movie. The problem is, absolutely NO character here is given center stage! So neither Kirk or Khan get the chance to ""steal the show"". It's not the actors fault really. They did then best they could with the mediocre lines and plot they were given.",Star Trek Into Darkness
363,dellamorte-44869,Worst Trek film to date,1,15 September 2018,WoK lite. The best way to describe this film to a true Trek fan. It is uncreative drivel that is boarding plagiarism!

364,Critomaton,Watch it in 2D - You'll be 33% less disappointed,3,19 May 2013,"They should have called this ""Star Trek: The Wrath of Yawn"".This movie single-handedly takes the trifecta of bad filmmaking. It is simultaneously: 1) An uninspired sequel, 2) an unnecessary remake of a classic, and 3) a 3D mess. So I'm giving it a 3 out of 10.I liked the first J.J. Abrams Star Trek movie, even though I couldn't really follow the plot. This time, I followed the plot just fine, because I've seen it dozens of times on cable in the past 30 years.The witty repartee between crew members is well done, but everything else falls short. As with Iron Man 3, it's very obvious that most of the action scenes are intended to exploit 3D, which means that clarity and visual coherence mean nothing - all that matters is that a bunch of stuff comes flying at you.This makes it impossible to appreciate the effects or immerse yourself in the story. Most of the spaceships look uninspired on the outside and preposterously cavernous and complex on the inside.There was an audible groan when people in the audience realized this was just a rehash of Wrath of Khan.There are a lot of things wrong with this movie, so you have to dig deep to find the worst one:Forget that Kirk got his command back about five minutes after he lost it, following a scene pulled straight from Godfather III (not to mention dozens of space-based video games).Forget the preposterous chase of a Millennium Falcon rip-off through a rebuilt-Death-Star-like maze.Forget that Scotty somehow single-handedly sabotaged a double-size, weaponized Enterprise rip-off (oh yeah, it was automated for a skeleton crew, that explains it).Forget that Nimoy Spock made a pointless cameo that broke the fourth wall by practically saying ""Here's what we did in the original movie...""No, the worst part of this movie is the whole Khan backstory and motivation. In Star Trek II, it was very clear why Khan was so ticked off, and it was possible to empathize a bit with him after he and his crew were left abandoned and forgotten on Ceti Alpha V. This time around, Khan was thawed out just so they could get a super-genius's opinion on how to start a war. Say what?And Khan is a ruthless, cold-blooded murderer, but he's only doing it to expose RoboCop as a ruthless, cold-blooded murderer, so he's sort of a good guy? And the whole chain of events is started by a StarFleet employee who is willing to kill himself and dozens of other people just to cure his daughter from a terminal disease. Who does that? There are no cool Khan pectorals on display here - real or otherwise. No flowing Fabio hair. No quotes from Herman Melville. Or maybe there are, I don't know. No cool hippie/groupie crew for Khan to interact with. No rich, Corinthian leather. Everything that made Khan's wrath great is absent from this film.I was really looking forward to this movie. Now I'll be completely uninterested in the next one. It's clear they're out of ideas.",Star Trek Into Darkness
365,paulsrobinson,A blisteringly paced action film,8,14 May 2013,"""Damn it Jim, I'm a doctor, not a torpedo technician!""The much hyped sequel to J. J. Abrams reboot is here, and it does not disappoint. Star Trek Into Darkness is an exhilarating fast paced action extravaganza.When a terrorist declares a one man war against the Federation, Captain KirK and the Enterprise crew, are charged with tracking him down. All of the cast from the first film return, with Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto continuing to impress in the roles of Kirk and Spock respectively. With a good supporting cast well suited to their roles. Except and it really pains me to say, the exception is Simon Pegg who is a lesser copy and essentially a caricature of the original. As originally stated the film does move at an exhilarating pace moving the story along, keeping the adrenaline high, and providing plenty of entertaining action. The best addition to the franchise is the introduction of Benedict Cumberbatch as terrorist John Harrison. Having recently just caught up with the BBC show Sherlock i knew Cumberbatch would excel at the psychological side of being a threat to the Federation. But i was not so sure about a physical threat but he does across as a definite bad-ass. Especially shown in a scene once the Enterprise track him down to the planet he is hiding on. In the end providing a very real threat to the crew and Federation.Regarding the shooting style of J.J. Abrams, i have liked everyone of his movie so far, especially Super 8. But does anyone else get a bit fed up of the lens flares he uses on the film way to much. Also the film moves at such a blistering pace, it does sometimes make it hard to fully invest into the story. For anyone who like Abrams first jaunt into the Star Trek universe should like this, and i hope to see some more adventures of the Starship USS Enterprise in the future. Also going off this the Stars Wars universe seems to be in safe hands.",Star Trek Into Darkness
366,S_Craig_Zahler,Stupidly Goes Exactly Where Everyone Went Before: Into Dumbness,3,18 May 2013,"Star Trek is one of the only television successes to contain some actual science fiction concepts, especially from 3rd season forward in Next Generation, but this movie, like it's crappy reboot predecessor is an action movie with spaceships. Into Darkness has about as much science fiction and boldly going as the recent James Bond, Skyfall, which is to say ... sadly ... none.This terrible writing team (the guy who couldn't figure out what to do with the show Lost or the movie Prometheus and the idiots behind Transformers) has contrived a tapestry of action with artificial amped-up crisis after crisis--- the entire movie is essentially action scenes with a couple of pauses for clichéd dramatic beats--- ""You're a loose cannon!"" ""This time ... it's personal!"" ""Vulcans should be more emotional.""Most of the cast is terrible cartoon caricature (Scotty & Bones are abysmal Saturday Night Live sketch performances), except Greenwood as Pike (this actor is directorproof, great in Exotica) and Kirk and Spock are good enough to keep me interested at a level of almost a 4. The things lifted from Wrath of Khan are numerous and embarrassing and exemplify everything that is wrong with Hollywood and the remake/reboot machine: No CREATIVITY anywhere. Too much attempt to please the crowd, without any thought, challenge or boldly going anywhere.Looks like JJ Abrams is well set up to continue making Star Wars movies exactly as cluttered and contrived and silly as The Phantom Menace. Cluttered Action Sequences + Thievery (aka ""homages"") + Caricatures = Into DarknessIt's sad that an innovative franchise is now a dumb, loud and thoughtless lowest common denominator junk. Sci-fi should make you think, but this pile of noise shuts down the thinking process.",Star Trek Into Darkness
367,bdl7431,"Some positives, some negatives",7,19 July 2014,"OK, let me be up-front with this - I am a Star Trek fan. Nonetheless, I was expecting something more or different with the re-boot.SPOILER ALERTI understand the Star Trek reboot makes a lot of wink-wink/nudge-nudge references to the original series - for example, when Spock is being rescued from the volcano, McCoy/Bones tells him over the communicator ""Shut up Spock, we're saving you!"". This is similar to the classic line in ""The Immunity Syndrome"". For Trek fans, this is enjoyable.The problem I had with the film was that towards the end it became a redo of ""Wrath of Khan"". We have a character yelling ""KHAN!"" - although it is Spock, not Kirk this time - and a character gets killed saving the ship by fixing the engines at the last second - except it is Kirk, not Spock. The scene in the air lock between Spock and Kirk is extremely reminiscent of the same scene in ""Wrath of Khan"". For people who remember ""Wrath of Khan"" - admittedly, Wrath is over 30 years old - this is somewhat disappointing since it makes the road the film is taking familiar.This is not to say the film is not without merits. Benedict Cumberbatch is WONDERFUL as Khan, easily rivaling and surpassing Ricardo Montalban's performance in Wrath of Khan. The acting from Chris Pine (Kirk) and Zachery Quinto (Spock) are also quite good, as the film does center around them; the remaining actors, to be honest with you, can pretty much be average in their performances without affecting the move much. The special effects are quite good as well without overpowering the film or making it look stupid. And there is some good old fashion Star Trek moralizing - except this time it is about the use of drones to kill folks without a trail. But the familiar/predictable end of the film that knocks what could of been a great film into simply good.",Star Trek Into Darkness

All the cast were great especially the cameo form Leonard Nimoy , also the visual effects were stunning & the pace of the film , humor & action were all put together brilliantly .

369,BharatSamra,Benedict CumberBOSS,7,15 June 2013,"Star Trek Into Darkness is a superior sequel in every way compared to its 2009 predecessor. J. J. Abrams' second effort in the franchise travels galaxies further in action, characters and overall storytelling which makes the sequel overall, indisputably an enjoyable experience.Cats would be all over my tongue if I attempted to approach Star Trek Into Darkness from the perspective of a Trek fan due to my unfamiliarity with the Star Trek universe that fans hold dear. Rather, this 2013 instalment is a much more approachable story than Star Trek (2009), and this mass appeal may discourage some loyal fans to the series, though I am unable to confirm such a claim. What I can say is that the film simply entertains and certainly makes Paramount's profuse marketing worth the effort. Even more so than the lavish yet appropriate CG effects, the character interactions emerge victorious in the quest for cinematic supremacy. The experience is only heightened by the trekmendous cast, particularly Chris Pine, Zachary Quinto andBenedict Cumberbatch (Yes, he is that good he deserves his own paragraph). The Sherlock actor absolutely dominates each and every second of screen time through voice, actions, persona and the intentions of his character John Harrison. He is so spectacularly, ostentatiously gracious is where he takes the character, and that destination will almost undoubtedly flourish over time, into one of the most memorable motion picture villains of the early 21st century. Each time his scenes conclude or the camera cuts away from him, inside you feel a little disappointed ""ohhh, ahhh"" hoping for his return soon due to Cumberbatch's franchise-defining performance. If you fail to take much away from Star Trek Into Darkness, I can almost assure you that the iconic, villainous portrayal by Cumberbatch will be imprinted into your mind for a long time to come.While Cumberbatch's performance remains isolated from the film's other elements in its magnificence, the interdependent relationship between James. T Kirk (Chris Pine) and Spock (Zachary Quinto) prospers so greatly as their relationship develops, and feels more genuine than their previous collaboration four years ago. They share such a magical dialogue between one another, filled with wit, rhythm and even emotional chemistry, which is most explicitly examined during the unexpectedly heartfelt climax of the film. The writers (Roberto Orci, Alex Kurtzman and Damon Lindelof) warrant an enormous amount of credit for displaying how films that are primarily action based, can in fact posses scenes of characters verbally interacting with one another and still remain as strong blockbuster fun.Of course, Star Trek Into Darkness wouldn't achieve its blockbuster status by having its array of adored characters talking for two hours. No, the film requires an enormous amount of visual effects in order to achieve its title, and fortunately, the action is actually quite remarkably enjoyable. Dazzling images of majestic terror, colourful settings and of course explosions captivate your gaze for 132 minutes as they make you feel you are drifting through space for the first time, surrounded by unknown sights to behold. All the while, Star Trek Into Darkness manages to stay on course and not allow itself to divert into overlong and frustrating routes of action.The film is certainly not without its conveniences to presumably satisfy its audience; though ironically by doing this it dissatisfies the viewer as the level of predictability increases throughout and the story's resolution irritatingly pounces on an opportunity to conclude itself 'happily' and keep the narrative self-contained. This is primarily frustrating due to the manner in which the film could have ended: as an emotionally investing, sacrificial and unpredictable satisfying film. Instead, the plot's direction puts the clutch into reverse and ends up going back on itself due to its level of predictability as equilibrium is restored.If you are able to forgive the film's weaker elements and preserve judgement for the highly enjoyable experience that surrounds the characters and action, then Star Trek Into Darkness is likely to fulfil everything that it has promised. Even if in six months the four words Star, Trek, Into and Darkness fail to mean anything to you, be warned that the wrath of Cumberbatch's prevailing performance will likely remain prevalent amongst the mind's of us cinema-goers when considering who the greatest cinematic villains of recent history are.",Star Trek Into Darkness
370,sasikanth20,A good watch!,8,20 January 2014,"Though the script is a little more complicated than the first movie, J.J. Abrams did a decent job with it. The direction is pretty neat, and the screenplay is decent. Chris Pine does a very good as Kirk, while Zachary Quinto does a brilliant job as Spock. Benedict Cumberbatch is equally good as Khan. The rest of the cast did a good job. On technical front, the visuals are excellent. Most of the IMAX shots were graphic works, but good. The rendered 3D work was excellent, but shooting with 3D cameras would have made it even better. Nevertheless, I loved the effects. Music by Michael Giacchino is good, while cinematography by Daniel Mindel is perfect.

I am familiar with the movies and to be honest, Wrath of Khan and Search for Spock were movies I remember watching and liked. I consider myself a sci-fi fan, a fan of just science fiction. Trek, Star Wars, and whatnot, I don't care. Anyway, when going into seeing this movie, for some reason, Wrath of Khan was stuck in my head. As the movie went on, I awed and laughed. The story was good, the cast did a phenomenal job, the effects were good and practically everything else was just solid. Of course, then came the moments where it finally dawned on me that this like a pseudo remake of Wrath of Khan. I was a little upset but putting that aside, this movie was in my opinion just as good as the other. Abrams did a phenomenal job of creating a stellar movie to add to the Star Trek Franchise. It is by far better than TNG saga (Generations, Insurrection, First Contact and Nemesis). Replay value is slightly above average if I want to see this again in theaters or wait until DVD release.

372,maddog-50,Again: This is NOT Star Trek!,1,8 May 2013,"First let me say that i expect a ridiculous high rating at IMDb (right now, higher than Gandhi, Ben-Hur, Rocky, etc., because all these movies only have a tiny fraction of the awesomeness THIS brilliant masterpiece of epic filmmaking has...*cough*) for this one as well because most of the 'awesome beyond believe' - reviews were done by payed rating agencies!J.J. Abrams' v(er)(i)sion of Star Trek has absolutely NOTHING in common with the ideas and visions of Gene Roddenberry. Abrams' abilities of story telling are based on two recipes: 1. luring the audience with questions but never giving the answer, 2. it stops after 40 min.. According to the motto, one fool can ask more questions than seven wise men can ever answer, Abrams' stories are therefore the pure exploitation of the curiosity of the audience, leaving you disappointed and empty, because all you got was a patchwork of 40 min pieces, connected by stunningly dumb and unrealistic cliffhangers without any satisfying end. I know that there are many Abrams fan boys out there who like Abrams' 'Lost'- style of storytelling, but folks, it's NOT always like it was for you at school: if you don't understand something, it doesn't mean automatically, that there's something meaningful going on! If there are plot holes, inconsistencies, stupid dialogs, too much pretty people doing too much stupid things and too much action & lens flares in your eyes, then, sometimes, the movie is just plain bad, and nobody understands what's going on, believe me! Into Darkness is visually (CGI) intriguing which might be the only reason for the targeted audience (8-16 y.o.m) to score that flick as awesome. BTW, Abrams' put some new lenses in his cameras, (almost) no flares anymore... The character development is reduced to action figures in space with every thinkable cliché (dudes can be categorized as cool, cute, nerdy, romantic, tough, chicks are hot, dudes outnumber the chicks which causes some rivalry anyway...) which looks like a cast for a boy/girl group thing. As you might expect then, all there is about equipment, wardrobe, technical details was not designed to be appropriate or functional, but rather to look good & cool somehow. Every story ever written for TNG, TOS is by far more ambitious than this crap from the 'wouldn't it be cool if'-department here.I do not understand why Paramount decided to reboot the franchise in that way. At least it must have been obvious to them that you can't make a TV series with this reboot and Jar Jar Abrams, which literally would have been 'Lost' in Space. Let's hope that this reboot thing will only last a couple of movies with 3-4 years intervals AND let's hope that someone at Paramount has enough brains to make another Star Trek series in the sense of Roddenberry and all the true Star Trek fans out there...",Star Trek Into Darkness
373,bm2759,Good follow up,7,30 May 2013,"As a scfi fan quite excited to see this film I unfortunately left disappoint a little. JJ Abrams said this is a stand-alone film where the audience does not need to have seen prior Star Trek films to enjoy. This is true to a certain extent where you realise it references and reuses much Star Trek history. I thought this is a good and bad aspect of the film. The reason is because whilst it is unoriginal to a degree it enables old fans to be acknowledged and new fans to enjoy the film. Old fans might also see the crew, besides Kirk and Spock, have minimal screen time. I was also disappointed with this because they almost disappeared. However those who know the history of this franchise will enjoy it more because of these references to past star trek works.From the beginning of the film action occurs regularly and at varied scales. Any fan of action films will be awed by the large set piece sequences unfolding before them with satisfying SFX, great art designs, and sound. Visuals clearly are one of the strong aspects that most, including me, immediately are impressed by (especially the warp battle scene). Also seeing a futuristic Earth is great and I really wanted to see more of it than we did however what you do see is great.Acting from all was just fine. Not one line of dialogue was out of place.The story itself is good but as said earlier reuses and references too much Star Trek history to be praised for originality. I know this is an alternative universe where events only up to a certain point are changed but the reasons for everything that occurs is largely one persons imagination, i.e. we don't see events which generate the supposedly perpetuated fear. I believe that 'Into Darkness' is an incorrectly chosen title because there isn't much darkness in this film.In critiquing the story think the antagonist's action are too extreme for what he aims to achieve; he is experienced in war, has a calm demeanour, is methodical and is strategic. Somehow despite his motivations for his actions the collateral damage incurred doesn't fit. This makes no sense to me because we find out who his target is all along. If he is very skilled and capable then why kill so many others when one person is your target. Friends have said 'he is a complex bad guy' whereas my impression is his character doesn't match his actions.You shouldn't be surprised that with little screen time the crew of the Enterprise hardly develop as characters, except for Sulu, Kirk and Spock. They do get their screen time but we see no growth or change in the characters. Hence the crew become backdrops to transport Kirk and Spock around to have a swash-buckling adventure.If you are interested in seeing this film please do. You will be entertained and escape from reality for a few hours. Whilst you will have some enjoyment you might leave a little disappointed like I did. The reason is because the story reuses and references too much past material, the antagonist's character and actions are a mis-fit; and the Enterprise crew (besides Kirk and Spock) are minor characters.",Star Trek Into Darkness
374,andre_rox99,A Space Voyage filled with Mind-Blowing Visual Effects & GREAT Acting!,9,6 June 2013,"STAR TREK: INTO DARKNESS is the sequel to 2009's STAR TREK, directed by J.J. Abrams, starring Chris Pine, Zachary Quinto, Zoe Saldana & Simon Pegg.The film shows Kirk (Chris Pine) as Captain of Star Fleet, and how he deals with mass terrorism caused by Khan (Benedict Cumberbatch) who has killed people as well as his closest relatives, along with Commander Spock (Zachary Quinto).The trailer of Star Trek: Into Darkness was extremely impressive; it didn't reveal any of the plot and kept the element of surprise for many, which was greatly appreciated. The movie provided everything anyone expects from a sci-fi flick- action, suspense, thrills and emotion, and J.J. Abrams has managed to show this in extreme finesse surrounded with spectacular visual effects.Note to anyone who wants to watch this- STAR TREK: INTO DARKNESS can be watched by anyone; whether Star Trek fan or not. Neither do you have to see the first film to understand anything, as Into Darkness manages to start off a fresh page after Kirk is made Captain.The acting is GREAT. Chris Pine as Captain Kirk is always fun to watch. I loved Zachary Quinto as Spock; he managed to do it in his robotic way as usual Star Trek fans would expect. His role as a robotic, smart, law- abiding person paired with a care-free, large-hearted person (Kirk) proved to be a good friendship when played by Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto. Zoe Saldana didn't offer anything SPECTACULAR, however, she did do a good job.Benedict Cumberbatch is becoming an even better actor with every role he does. He, first, had his break-through in Sherlock and has managed to probe he is much better after Star Trek: Into Darkness. His role as a villain is flawless; he is managed to show that shrewd, threatening person that Khan is. He has even managed to show his audience the combat skills he has. Other than Spock, Cumberbatch is one of the best things of this movie.Overall, I would say that STAR TREK: INTO DARKNESS is a GREAT way to start off the summer holidays. It's got all the elements for a summer sci-flick and it manages to deliver. The only thing that keeps it short from getting a full 10 is the fact that after a few hours, you quite forget a bit of the film, but upon viewing it again, it remains sharp in your memory; the visual effects and acting fails to leave you.STAR TREK: INTO DARKNESS- 9.5/10",Star Trek Into Darkness

I still don't like that the ""explorer"" and ""new worlds"" ideals of the original Star Trek have basically been thrown into the garbage, but the character studies of the central characters got a whole lot better in this ""episode.""Karl Urban, in particular, deserves a huge bonus/raise for interpreting the personality of the McCoy character far better than any other actor in the Reboot. His caustic, emotional interpretation is simultaneously hilarious and poignant.I also like the development of the Chekov and Uhura characters. That was rarely attempted in the original series.Benedict Cumberbatch has really made his mark playing the sullen anti-hero in many films lately.

377,danielloe,Great cast and effects make up for plot holes,8,20 July 2015,"*WARNING CONTAINS HEAVY SPOILERS* So after the first Star Trek movie which I really loved, there was a very long wait, and then finally, in 2013, after four whole years between movies, Star Trek Into Darkness came out, and, I was not one bit disappointed. That's not to say it's the equal of J.J. Abrams's original master piece, which showed the entire crew coming together and their first meetings and the start of the friendship between Kirk and Spock, but this does give us something else. A great villain. Benedict Cumberbatch plays that villain, and that villain is: Khan. And to be 100% honest, Cumberbatch has to be one of the best Star Trek villains of all time, he was just a very menacing and very memorable villain. Watching him just wipe out about twenty Klingon warrior single-handedly was a very entertaining action scene, and what makes it even better is that Khan just surrenders to Kirk, and then Kirk just starts wailing away on him, to which Khan stands there placidly, while Kirk keeps hitting him. That was a great scene. It's hard to get more menacing than just showing that the hero can do nothing to hurt you. I also like the parallels between Kirk and Khan, which was a nice touch. Of course the old cast is back, and they're all great. I liked the new dynamic between Kirk and Spock, where, you can tell they're friends, but they both have such different viewpoints, that there is a lot of conflict, and while Kirk is in control of a ship and more responsible, he's still the same guy as in the first one. I also liked that despite all the time they spent telling us how irresponsible Kirk is that by the end of the film, he finally comes to accept his responsibility as Captain, and is willing to sacrifice himself to save the ship. Bones isn't as good in this one, he barely has anything to do, but Karl Urban was still good. Carol Marcus is a nice addition to the cast, as is her father, Admiral Marcus, who makes for a good villain as well. I also think the tone of this movie was really great, it's dark, and you can tell things are dangerous for our heroes, but it's still a fun ride, it's not just all gloom and doom. The terrorist stories they've introduced in the more recent Star Trek stories is a good touch, since Star Trek's whole thing is dealing with current social issues. However, there were some things that were not good, and one of those is the pacing. I'm not sure if that's the right term, but this was a glaring issue later in the film. Okay, so first of all, Scotty disables the Vengeance, and Admiral Marcus sends security to deal with him , Kirk and Khan. Those guys get wiped out in like five seconds, and then... in the entire time it takes the heroes to reach the bridge, Marcus and his crew are still just sitting there, doing nothing. Or, later in the film, when Spock damages the Vengeance and Khan is going down with it, there's like ten minutes with the crew trying to save the Enterprise, and then, we finally get back to Khan and the Vengeance. It's like they just forgot about him, and then just shoved him in there to set up for the finale. And then there are the plot-holes. You can beam someone down to Earth, but you can't beam someone back up? Huh? Or, why Can't Bones just use one of the other Augment's blood to save Jim, does it have to be Khan? There are also numerous shout-outs to Wrath of Khan, some work, others feel too goofy. Kirk's sacrifice, that works, Spock yelling, ""KHAAAAAN!"", that felt pretty silly. Still, they were a nice touch, and I thought this film was a worthy successor to the original Star Trek, and I'm looking forward to where these movies go next.",Star Trek Into Darkness
378,ajrcvr,A continuation of the Star Trek legend that captivates once more,9,16 June 2016,"Not often does a sequel, especially the sequel to a remake, do as good a job at enthralling its viewers as the original. This one did and might have even exceeded it. The 'Star Trek' characters continue to be wonderful & engaging, an absolute pleasure to watch, while Kirk & Spock's relationship deepens and becomes a very moving element of the storyline, which, in this franchise, absolutely has to happen. The story once again grabs you and pulls you in, particularly with the addition of Benedict Cumberbatch, a simply marvelous actor, who does a wonderful job as the new Khan, and almost single-handedly steals the whole show, and in many places actually does! The action is great, captivating, and fun to watch, the relationships poignant and intriguing, and overall it's like an old friend with a new twist pleasing you all over again.",Star Trek Into Darkness
379,DrLex,As if they hollowed out someone's head and put popcorn inside,5,15 October 2013,"This will not be a review that pinpoints all kinds of technical details that this film violates regarding the original franchise. I will not require spoilers to explain what is wrong with Star Trek Into Darkness. I am not a Trekkie by far. Only very recently I watched through the original series. It was an interesting experience. Many episodes were obviously outdated but it was surprising to see how modern some of the ideas and how well- written the scripts were. The series managed to be interesting with a low budget and a spartan look.Star Trek Into Darkness is the opposite. It is a complete overload of special effects and visual design, wrapped around a simple story filled with clichés and predictability, and devoid of any depth. Every scene is filled with over-designed crap all the time. There is too much stuff on the screen, really. There is so much to look at that nothing stands out. Any good director will focus attention on what is truly important by toning down redundant details in the rest of the image. This film however is 90% redundant details and 10% relevance. The duration of the end credits (I estimate some 12 minutes) illustrates this. Of course they had to include every person who made one of the gazillion 3D models featured in this film.Imagine someone smart. Someone who is famous for being thoughtful, intelligent, maybe boring at times but always interesting in the end. That is the original Star Trek.Now imagine opening up this person's skull, scooping out the brains, and putting popcorn in place. Then seal it back up, apply loads of extra cosmetic surgery, and polish it up real good. That is Star Trek Into Darkness.They took a franchise and mimicked all its superficial appearances like the names, characters, and some plot devices. But they removed all the substance. They even tried hard to find actors who look like plausible young versions of their counterparts in the original series (especially Karl Urban and Simon Pegg are right on the spot). But that is where the similarities end. This is a staple of many a contemporary ""reboot"" or ""remake"": focus on superficial similarities with the original, and total disregard for the essence. Why even bother trying to disguise it as a remake of something old? They should have given it a new name so nobody is being fooled.In the end, STID is just a bog standard contemporary action movie with a whiff of Star Trek flavor. If you long for two hours of visual effects, explosions, and noise, then by all means indulge yourself. But if you want to watch something that has any of the depth that was characteristic for the Star Trek TV series, stay away.",Star Trek Into Darkness
380,svr-2200,"Star Trek Into Darkness is a visually epic, thrilling, stylish film with spectacular and stunning sequences.",8,25 September 2017,"Star Trek Into Darkness: Movie Review. Star Trek Into Darkness is an exciting and intriguing science fiction action film with cinematic story telling, along with gripping visuals. character design and dazzling effects. The direction is good and the performances are great. Benedict Cumberbatch and Chris Pine, both are excellent in their respective characters and for me,especially Benedict Cumberbatch totally nailed it. Benedict Cumberbatch is one my most favourite actor it was like a treat to me to see him in a negative characterization. And the scene in the film and one of the best and most awesome character moments in the film when he says: Quote:""Kirk: Who the hell are you? Khan: A remnant of a time long past. Genetically engineered to be superior so as to lead others to peace in a world at war.and John Harrison: I am better. Kirk: At what? John Harrison: Everything.""These moments gives me chills every time I see the film. Rest of the cast and characters are also good in their respective roles and their characterization.The movie has some unnecessary scenes and the feels little rushed at certain points. There is lack of emotional depth and intensity in some dramatic scenes and some supporting characters are sidelined. But, all over Star Trek Into Darkness is a fantastic film. (Please Note: That This Review represent only my professional point of view and my personal honest opinion about the film, and does not represent others. Thank You).",Star Trek Into Darkness
381,buiredintime,Into darkness where only the bold will go,9,15 May 2013,"Man what a few years of waiting can do to a person. Since Star Trek was rebooted to fun fan reaction and impressive box office numbers, we've waited for sometime 4 years to be exact to get a sequel. Well not only do we get a fully engaging sequel that manages to outpace and out excite the original, but we also get a movie that feels straight on like a Star Trek movie.Star Trek Into Darkness tells the tale of James Kirk (Chris Pine), a man who feels that the rules of starfleet are and can be broken if it comes in the effort to keep his crew alive. When his last mission causes his immediate dismissal of his command of the Enterprise thanks to a report by Spock (Zachary Quinto), it sets into motion the idea of the basis of the story which ask ""What would you be willing if confronted with your own end and how far would you go to protect your crew?"".This question plays off on the main story revolving around John Harrison (Bernedict Cumberbatch), who has as it seems on the surface taken an all out single war against the federation and with the echoes of 9/11 and the Boston Bombings hits closer to home with a lot of us.What comes from there is a trek to the Klingon world of Kronos to apprehend Harrison after one of Kirks inspiration is killed. Form the moment Harrison is captured, the game is on.This is a movie to me that does it all, it excites, it causes emotion and is one heck of a pretty looking movie (thanks to really well done CGI, thanks in part to ILM). It's the kind of movie that you go into knowing it looks good and then realizing that it delivers in spades thanks to all the cogs working together.I give props to J.J. Abrams and the Writers for upping the ante and giving nods to earlier trek movies. This is a movie of the highest order and one of the best of the year.",Star Trek Into Darkness
382,moviesrme10,"Not as good as first film, it's still pretty decent",7,24 June 2013,"This review has been deleted 2 times, so i'm just going to start my review with the dang negatives, and say this film has been a slight disappointment based on the fact that it is one of my highly anticipated list of the year and my most anticipated film of the summer. Now i most say the negatives include, lack of tension, poor opening, lack of screen time for villain, and the length. Now to start this review off by saying that the film began with action, instead of starting off the same way the first film started, and starting off slow and building momentum leading up to action then starting over again. By starting with action, i was still trying to comprehend what the hell was going on, and when spock almost got killed, i should have been at the edge of my seat. Was i? No, i still was trying to understand what was happening. And the action never stopped, for a long enough chunk of time for me to feel tension, and emotion at what was happening, this film just didn't build up. I just was never able to feel anything during the spectacular action sequences. There was just to dang much. Thats why i criticize the opening, which featured Kirk running threw a forest of red trees. That scene should have been cut out of the film, or shortened, so we could include more story development, and more screen time for our villain,, which leads me into my next argument which is of the amount of screen presence of our villain. Our villain should have had a lot more time on screen then he received he should have caused a lot more destruction before fleeing to another planet and being captured by Kirk. I felt he was well enough characterized but he should have received more time to do his evil stunts, and to add to why he is a bad ass villain. As well as more screen time for Kirk and Spock interacting before space. This film should have been hobbit sized, and 3 Hours. That leads me into my complaint of the length. This film just had too short of a length too accommodate all of it's needed materials, as i have already explained to you all. I suggest cutting, or trimming the opening which featured Spock in a volcano, and Kirk running from wild animal creatures. This scene to me felt un - necessary. Now that we have discussed the issues of the film, lets move onto the positive side of the film. That includes the acting, casting of the villain, special effects, humor, screen- play, costumes, and direction. The acting in this film, is spot on. It's all very realistic and well toned. Zachary Quinto as Spock is once again excellently acted, and performed, i believe his seriousness and he is an emotional draw. Benedict Cumberbatch, is another splendid actor, who gave his soul to this film, he played a believable villain, and seemed very much sinister and scary. He is a very impressive villain, and one of the best actors of the now. Other actors to mention include newbie Alice Eve, and Chris Pine who both perform a bit above standards. The special effects of the film are spot on, and realistic too the point of believing they are really there. They make this film glimmer, and shine, and polish this beautiful film. This film is very humorous, which plays very well to this mostly serious film. This lightens the story and makes it less dark, and more fun to watch, which has worked very well with this particular film i must say. Now as for the screen play other then the lack of more screen time for the villain and some un necessary scenes, the script is pretty good ta making suitable lines for the film, this was pretty good, and was not cheesy at all. The costumes in this film are very original, and very well detailed to the point where they seem like they had come off of the actual t.v show. They were well designed , and pretty cool to look at for me, i want one. And finally, we close this with a dedicated thank you to the director, for bringing us another winner in the end- J.J Abrams. He has accomplished himself, as a very excellent director of science fiction films, and has earned a place with James Cameron and Steven Spielberg among my favorite directors. Without him helming this film, i think this film would have fell over and died just like that 2003 Hulk movie, which failed because of choosing the wrong director for the job, Ang Lee, while he is a fantastic director super hero films are not his thing and it shows in the film. Well All an All, Star Trek Into Darkness may not be anywhere close to being as good as the first film, it does make it into the fresh list, with the help of a solid addition to the cast, Benedict Cumberbatch, excellent visuals, and great direction this Star Trek sequel holds up to expectations.

383,JolinKnight,A continue of a new Star Trek era,8,24 September 2013,"I can see that the Star Trek series will get their pride back. Since the early 70's last century Star Trek has already brought us a lot of fun. Although I have to admit that it can not compare with Star War in the last century, it has already beat Star War in this new era. If you ask me to recommend a movie talking about space war or adventure, definitely I will name these two. By the way, Serenity 2005 is also pretty attractive for uni-fans.This is the second one in the new Star Trek series, there are some connection between the new era master piece and the old ones. For example, the memory about Khan will be taken back, instead of the old ugly Khan, this is a handsome vivid Khan. Also continuing the story line, some actions keep the relationship with the last episode making the series consistent rather than once a story which is sort of boring.The story is also awesome, as it not very easy to tell who is the real bad guy, at least don't worry it is not our heroes. That makes the story meaningful and attractive, and if you are a movie junkie it is impossible for you to feel tired or something else negative during the movie. The proof to support me separating the recent two episodes from the previous ones is in the end. It is also a struggling and heart pulling ending. But the hero this time is no more other species but human ourselves, it seems that the director has realised that it is only human ourselves can solve the problem perplex ourselves.",Star Trek Into Darkness

385,darth_timon,Into Greatness,8,10 May 2013,"So, JJ Abrams sequel to the 2009 Star Trek film is finally here. I saw it last night, and now I offer up my thoughts and opinions. Be warned, this page contains MAJOR SPOILERS! I've tried to avoid doing so, but I make no promises, so if you don't want to know the juicy details, stop reading.... round about now.OK, so on with the review. First impressions? Great film. The title is a little misleading- the film has darker moments than the first installment, but it's still quite lively and exciting. The story moves a long at quite a fast pace, and by the time you're done getting over one particularly dramatic moment, there's another.Kirk and Spock's relationship, as well as Kirk's relationship with Starfleet at large and even his other senior officers, is strained at times in this film. He is eager to prove himself after a knock-back, keen to avenge the death of his mentor, and believes the rules and regulations are an impediment to his progress. He learns that his recklessness can prove costly- having not lost a single member going into the film, this soon changes as his mission and personal quest takes him deep into the heart of Klingon space, and then takes him back to face an enemy nestled within the heart of Starfleet- an enemy playing Kirk off against another enemy.The villain? Well, lets state the obvious- it's Khan, and Cumberbatch plays the role brilliantly. He is ruthless, cold and determined, and steals the show.There are some unexpected cameos- Leonard Nimoy reprises his role as Spock Prime for a nice little moment, and we get some interesting role reversals- not to mention a rehash of the epic cry 'Khaaaaan!' It's a tad cheesy but certainly entertaining! The action sequences are amazing. The Enterprise falling from space toward earth has to be seen to be believed, and the 'fight' between the Klingons and Khan is very impressive. Visually the film is a feast. One I would certainly watch again, and I eagerly await the DVD!",Star Trek Into Darkness
386,jgeorge4,"It was great, but....",7,26 May 2013,"Yes, ""Into Darkness"" was a very entertaining movie. But of course it was. When you have this terrific cast (including the menacing Cumberbatch), the directing talents of JJ Abrahms, the ""Star Trek"" franchise at your disposal, and a $100 zillion budget, then you darn well better make a great movie.And the movie was great. It was visually superb, and this cast has achieved a riveting synergy among each other. But by the end, the genuine fan must have walked away slightly disappointed. The point of the first installment of the movie was a complete reboot of the franchise, meaning they can do anything plot-wise and character-wise. And yet, here we are reliving a Star Trek saga I feel like we've seen a hundred times.TOTAL SPOILERS AHEAD Who could not see the ""let's bring Kirk back to life with the super-duper blood"" shtick coming? How many times do we have to watch a decimated Enterprise come crashing down upon a planet? Why do we even need to revamp Khan to begin with? Hasn't it been done enough? Oh well. Bottom line, pay your money, buy your popcorn and enjoy the impressive sci-fi scenery and superb performances.",Star Trek Into Darkness
387,kjruk,Indiana Jones disguised as Star Trek,7,1 September 2013,"I agree with the critics of this film. It could be any run of the mill Sci Fi actioneer. It is. If you didn't know what it should be you can enjoy it for what it is. All the scenes, all the action is very familiar and seems to me to be copied from other films - like Indiana Jones. There is humour - Scotty in particular. The villain is believable. But lots of the action isn't. There are lots of plot holes. What it lacks is anything new. Even the idea of the future is ordinary. So basically its just a sequence of bangs and explosions and fights and far too many ""we have 30 seconds till we all die"" countdown events.

390,vandykeu,"I really wanted to like it, but....",4,11 May 2013,"I really wanted to like ""into darkness"". I'm not a die-hard trekkie, but I like original series/movies well enough, and I really enjoyed the entire original Khan storyline. As soon as I heard the Khan rumors, I was both excited and anxious. Unfortunately, I think the anxious side won out.Don't get me wrong. It's a solid action flick, and the acting by pretty much everyone is fine, and Cumberbatch is amazing. But it's not star trek, and it especially is not wrath of khan, no matter how much it wants to be. Other reviews have focused on the good, so I'm going to focus on the bad (as I see it).First, in the originals, Khan is from central Asia and was played by a Mexican. In this movie, Khan is as English as the queen herself. Cumberbatch's excellent performance notwithstanding, why is he called ""Khan Noonien Singh"" if he's Engilish? The time travel event in the first movie would not have caused a fundamental change in Khan's race, accent, etc. It's a minor point, I know, but it really dragged me out of the movie.Second, key parts of the plot are uncomfortably repetitive of the original, with special effects added for the sake of hyperbole and all of the thoughtfulness of the original removed for simplicity. Though Kirk's journey into maturity is obviously meant to be introspective, it couldn't have been less subtle with a sledgehammer, particularly at certain key points in the plot. Parts of London and San Francisco are destroyed just to make the effects and reinforce what a bad guy Khan is, but the consequences of the horror go unrealized. Khan himself is the mechanism of a really cheesy reincarnation that follows a really cheesy exploitation of the original film.Third, although the acting by the crew is fine, the dialogue is sophomoric and obvious. McCoy is meant to be the conscience of the crew, the thoughtful one holding everyone back from rash decisions. Here, Karl Urban is given nothing but shoddy one-liners. Simon Pegg and Anton Yelchin are similarly disused.Abrams thankfully doesn't use as much camera shake as last time, but there are still plenty of lens flares, fast zooms, and weird angles, as well as nods to star wars. They're cheap, hack, and do nothing to advance the story. As a fan of both franchises, I hate that they will all soon suffer from these faults. Cut the redundancy and hack cinematography and try to come up with some creative original plots, JJ!",Star Trek Into Darkness
391,smg242,I was expecting it to be better...,8,3 April 2014,"Well, the first Star Trek film makes it pretty obvious that this one has some pretty big shoes to fill. It was brilliant in literally every way. However, there seems to be a trend in movies, that in a trilogy, the second movie is generally the best. For example, The Empire Strikes Back, Spider-Man 2, The Two Towers, and most recognizably, The Dark Knight. Even the new Captain America: The Winter Soldier is better than the first. This one, however, pulls an Iron Man 2.Yes, Star Trek Into Darkness is noticeably better than most other sci-fi action flicks you'll ever see. Seriously, it puts the Star Wars prequel trilogy to shame. But it's still not better than the first film. The formula is all right: an obviously darker plot and more developed characters. Kirk, Spock and the whole crew of the Enterprise are a bit more mature, and are now used to their voyages.However, what this film lacks is the spirit and the CLEVER plot of the first. I can understand that it's more of a 'story before plot' thing, which is pretty normal for second acts. But, the first film was just way too good. Also, it was an ORIGIN story. The first film introduces you to all these new characters and aspects of Star Trek, and ever so smoothly. Also, the first film had a pretty clever plot, with some twists. This one sacrifices a clever plot for a pretty interesting mystery, and improved action.As for visual effects, this film is quite a few notches better than the first film. As noted before, the action sequences have also improved. To be honest, this film really does tell a nice story, even though it lacks in plot. Also, the acting, which was brilliant in the first film, is much, MUCH better in this film. This is probably some of the best acting you'll ever see in a sci-fi flick. Benedict Cumberbatch as the villain STEALS any thunder that comes his way. His performance and his character shall stay in sci-fi history, as one of the best.So, overall, this film may not be better than the first, but it definitely deserves a watch. It's another solid science fiction spectacle from J.J. Abrams, whose direction has, in fact, improved from the first film as well.It's sort of sad that he won't be returning for the third Star Trek film, with Star Wars and all for him to accomplish. Hope they get a good director for Star Trek 3...",Star Trek Into Darkness
392,starsteamer,Keeping Star Trek Alive,8,5 October 2013,"Having just watched this film I am actually shocked at the amount of negative reviews it has! I have just happily sat back and congratulated Abrams on keeping these films very much in keeping with the tone, mood and general world of the original. Those who have written these reviews seem to have watched only the series and not the films. They have forgotten that nearly all the films in this franchise were full of action, special effects and an antagonist. In fact, I suggest to them to rematch the older films then comment on this one! In actuality, the morality, humanity, politics and inter cast relationships have been lifted exactly from the original Star Trek film world. Abrams has really done his homework in regards to characterisation and setting. If you genuinely enjoyed the past Star Trek movies, you wil enjoy this one. If, however, your Star Trek universe only exists within the world of the series, then there will be too much action so go and watch the Next Generation reruns on TV instead.",Star Trek Into Darkness
393,jamesl2061-683-328126,Arguably the best Star Trek movie yet,10,12 May 2013,"There were concerns over having Abrams at the helm of this much awaited sequel to the last movie instalment. Then there was the script. We've seen the mixed bag of new generation sequels that followed the first series of original cast movies. They ranged from okay to bland and forgettable. The bar was finally raised with the last movie but with the vast fan base and hordes of Roddenberry faithful, yet another prequel presented a bigger challenge than arguably any other movie franchise, sci-fi or drama. I'd be lying if I said I didn't attend the screening with some concerns. Curiosity had, as always had got the better of me. At best, it would entertain without detracting and at worst, it would be at least a reasonable feast of CG on a big screen. As the tale unfolded however, my concerns evaporated. If you've never seen Trek movie before, you will enjoy this movie. Rich in plot, well-paced, good script and superb action. If you seen a few Trek movies, you will soon realise that this one surpasses those that came before. If you are a fan and have seen the previous movies and TV series, you will appreciate the way the plot intertwines with known story lines and characters, both past and present. The added twists are a bonus. In a nutshell, I thoroughly enjoyed this Star Trek movie. No spoilers, just go see it, then wait awhile and see it again.",Star Trek Into Darkness
394,FSfilmblog,JJ Strikes Back,9,14 May 2013,"The 2nd instalment of the new generation cast to cement their feet into the shoes of well established characters, settings and the famous ship, the Starship Enterprise. In the hands of JJ Abrams, the franchise is on the right course to expand and attract new fans. There will always be the die hard fans (and I'm not talking about the Bruce Willis films here guys!) who will object to their beloved characters and universe going in a different direction or in a particular style.This is a reboot, get over it. If people are so objectionable over the way the Star Trek mythology is handled you can go back to your Star Trek: The Motion Picture and your Star Trek Insurrection's and remember how dull and awfully slow they were. Those films will never be able to convert non fans to the franchise but this one and the previous chapter will, I for one, am on board and can not wait to see how things continue you develop. The sequel opens up with a bang as the crew (and the audience) are hurtled straight into danger. Kirk and co, are on a planet trying to save it's alien inhabitants from an erupting volcano. When things call for a drastic and immediate decision, Kirk disobeys Star Fleet code of ethics and saves the day. Unfortunately his superiors (and Spock) do not agree. Believing he will be assigned to a 5year exploration of deep space, he is instead call up to be reprimanded and loses his captaincy of the ship. Meanwhile in London, we are introduced to the mysterious John Harrison (Benedict Cumberbatch) who coerces a Star Fleet Officer with a promise to save his dying daughter for an exchange of a favour...I could go on with the plot, but it's safe to say it's up to the crew to stop Harrison's plot and there are plenty of twist and turns which will keep the viewers on their seat. All the cast return and put on their best impersonation of these well loved (and known) characters, some getting more screen time (Scotty) while others are reduces to little dialogue and actions (Sulu, Chekov and Bones) but that isn't really a criticism. If the characters were all given the same or more things to do, the film's run time would easily exceed 3+ hours. As it is, most of them are reduced to what their designated status and skill sets are to progress the plot's natural progression.The main leads do perform an admirable display and imbue their characters with a lot of depth and emotion. There is a genuine connection that the audience can feel between Kirk and Spock. Benedict Cumberbatch's villain is a great deal more than a maniacal menace. There is a reason for his vengeance against Star Fleet and there is a great deal of control to his performance which is never over the top and provides the viewer with sympathy to his cause.There are nods and winks to the Star Trek lore, (with the most apparent coming near the end) and there is an utter respect to the old films and series. Things which both old and new fans can both enjoy and appreciate. What is totally different is the pacing of theses films. There isn't many scenes where some explosion or action sequence is on show, but that is punctuated with very talky, science fiction dialogue as it cuts back and forth between action and drama. It works very well.Is this a better film than the previous effort. No. It's a continuation to the series which opens up many doors for it's characters and world to go into. It's a solid encounter for the crew of the Enterprise with a very polished finish (lens flair still intact!). It's an entertaining ride with some great touches of humour and dramatic performances, with plenty on offer for everyone.",Star Trek Into Darkness
395,houghtonetet,Intelligent blockbuster,10,17 May 2013,"JJ Abrams does not disappoint with this highly impressive sequel to his 2009 ""franchise reboot."" He is clearly a keen fan of Gene Roddenberry's 60s TV series, with many references to it. There was, apparently, long discussions as to whether this movie should be an adventure of discovery, somewhat like the 60s TV series, or another battle against a villain. I think the right choice was made, there is obviously a great deal of life to come yet in this franchise and some loose ends were wrapped up in this movie quite neatly.Abrams gives us a thriller which effortlessly leaps from one astonishing CGI set-piece to another, allied to a sharp script, some impressive acting, fast pacing, and always with a little humour here and there. He also builds up Kirk's character quite considerably this time. Chris Pine doesn't simply play ""Kirk the Jerk"" but shows more emotion and a greater range of acting. Ben Cumberbatch plays a deliciously icy villain who it is possible to feel sympathy for, if you think about his character, and there is good support from the usual gang. Simon Pegg gets a lot more screen time this time round, but Anton Yeltsin is sidelined a little, I thought. Karl Urban's Bones frets a lot, John Cho's Sulu gets a taste of command, and Zoe Saldana gets to continue her relationship with Spock and prove to be pivotal in one key scene. Zachary Quinto's Spock towers over the whole film, he was born to play this character and never puts a foot or a heartbeat wrong, he was quite simply amazing, stealing every scene he was in.If I could be incredibly picky I would say the only disappointment was the physical appearance of the Klingons, who I prefer as the swarthy pirate-types seen in the TV series rather than the Yorkshire-pudding heads they later became, but that is a detail.Credit to Abrams for providing a plot deep with messages about loyalty and comradeship, of the need to reign in recklessness and obey regulations, (and my daughter now has her heart set on owning a tribble!)Two hours slipped by in a few moments, do try and see this movie, it will be time and money well spent.10/10",Star Trek Into Darkness
396,jhuni_x,A major disappointment,1,26 May 2014,"This movie started out so promising. Captain Kirk makes the mistake of risking his first officers life to stop an erupting volcano. In order to save his first officers life he then sends his ship near the volcano to beam Spock aboard his ship, violating the prime directive in the process. Expecting a promotion for his actions, Kirk then goes to meet admiral Pike at Starfleet headquarters. Rather then receiving praise, Kirk receives criticism for his actions. Pike rightfully points out that Kirk thinks the rules do not apply to him and they he should not have risked his first officers life in the first place. He then goes on to point out that he will be demoted from captain to first officer under him until he is ready to be a captain again. This scene was perfect.But this scene ultimately does not matter at all. We then hear that Kirk is going to lose his command and then a minute later we hear that he is going to get his command back. Quite frankly this is an insulting sequence of events. Its like the creators of this movie do not want their viewers to be thinking well watching this. They just want their viewers to eat their popcorn and marvel at the special effects without actually thinking about anything that is being shown to them. By the ending of this movie admiral Pike dies leaving us with characters like Kirk that do not receive any consequences for their actions. As a result, unlike with the previous movie, I am no longer looking forward to seeing what happens in the next movie in this series.",Star Trek Into Darkness
397,jeddjong,Abrams' Trek Journeys Into Greatness,10,7 May 2013,"With 2009's Star Trek, director J. J. Abrams had set a course for the future of the series with a film that thoroughly invigorated what was, up to that point, largely seen as a flagging franchise. Love it or hate it, Star Trek '09 made the series accessible to the masses and perhaps the sexy young cast, the action sequences and the lens flares were just a way of helping the movie-going public at large let down their collective guards and learn to appreciate this cornerstone of science fiction through new eyes. Following a misadventurous opening sequence set on the planet Nibiru, Kirk and company return to Starfleet Headquarters in San Francisco, where the higher-ups are none too happy about the recklessness they displayed on Nibiru. This is interrupted by a new threat: an unstoppable one-man terror cell who goes by the name of ""John Harrison"" (Cumberbatch). Kirk leads the crew of the Enterprise in pursuit of Harrison, armed with 72 photon torpedoes and with newbie Dr Carol Marcus (Eve), daughter of Starfleet head Admiral Marcus (Weller), on board. Chief Engineer Scotty (Pegg) is suspicious of the contents of said weapons but his concern is initially unheeded. What follows is a dangerous quest that takes our heroes to the Klingon homeworld of Kronos, leading them to the discovery of the torpedoes' secret payload and the truth behind John Harrison's beef with Starfleet. Now, this is how you make a summer blockbuster. A tentpole sci- fi action flick doesn't have to be two hours of mind-numbing, cacophonous dross. Abrams, along with writers Roberto Orci, Alex Kurtzman, Damon Lindelof and the countless others involved have brought us a film that is fresh, relentlessly exciting and overflowing with white-knuckle action, and none of this at the expense of a compelling story or well-drawn characters. From the very first minute, this reviewer was yanked right into this fantastical world. Abrams all but announces ""buckle up, because it's going to be one hell of a ride"" – and what a ride Star Trek Into Darkness is. The Star Trek series has a magnificent legacy and has had an immeasurable impact on the genre, and to chuck all that away for all flash and no substance would be something of a crime. That's not the case here. Sure, there seems to be barely a minute to stop and catch one's breath, but that's probably preferable to a film that drags on and on any day of the week. The film has no shortage of pizazz in the form of stunning visual effects work, witty banter and edge-of-your seat near misses galore. Despite having ""darkness"" in its title, this flick is far from dour or depressing. References, homages and shout-outs are skilfully weaved into the fabric of the story and some may disagree, but this reviewer feels this iteration of Trek actually is very respectful of what went before – just not slavishly so. In this movie, Captain Kirk truly comes into his own as leader of a starship crew and father to his men, Pine further proving there's more to him than just his handsome mug. Sure, Kirk's still the brash, womanising guy we all love (we catch him in bed with two be-tailed alien sisters) but there is character growth to be had. The ever-uneasy friendship between Kirk and Spock also gets a fair amount of play, and there are some great moments between the two, ranging from casual brickbats to a pretty dramatic bit near the end of the film. Quinto conveys Spock's struggle to get in touch with his human side, his resistance to emotion driving a wedge between him and Uhura, but never hits us over the head with this. Just as in the earlier film, everyone gets a chance to strut his or her stuff – for example, Sulu even gets to be acting captain. Simon Pegg as Scotty and Karl Urban as Bones in particular stand out in this one, both bringing different brands of comic relief to the proceedings while functioning as far more than merely ""the funny guys"". Bones mentions that he once performed a Caesarean on a Gorn and delivered octuplets. It's a funny bit that's also a nice nod to the original series. Speaking of alien species, there's a tribble which turns out to be integral to the plot. This is also brilliant. Of course, the attention is square on Benedict Cumberbatch as the villain of the piece. Suffice it to say that fangirls of his will not be disappointed. The guy is a riveting actor, one who knows when to chew just the right amount of scenery in order to not come off as silly. There has been a spate of more ""intellectual"" villains in blockbuster movies as of late, but Cumberbatch does enough to differentiate himself from the bunch and Harrison isn't just all brains and no brawn – he single-handedly takes on a Klingon patrol in one action sequence. Star Trek Into Darkness is such a thrill that this reviewer left the theatre kind of breathless, but also really pumped. It's a big, big movie, but not the kind that's an extravagant insult to the intellects of audiences everywhere. Abrams has crafted a sequel that ups the game and elicits cheers, laughter, goosebumps, excited fist-pumping and even a tear or two at all the right moments. And isn't that warp effect just so sparklingly beautiful?Written for F*** Magazine",Star Trek Into Darkness

400,SforSmile,Hypergalactically Awesome in Warp Terms.,8,15 May 2013,"I belong to the people who believe in love on first sight and this movie managed to captivate me almost immediately and keep me enthralled until the very end, so that I can nothing but recommend it not only to the die-hard Trekkies but also to everybody else out there looking for two hours of intelligently made, action packed, visually stunning movie-entertainment that comes along with a - albeit slightly timid - yet powerful enough message.What became a fresh new, juvenile beginning (reboot) of a long since dusted franchise as the eleventh Star Trek movie entered the theaters in 2009, now found its worthy, and more mature, follow up that both builds a bridge to the first movies of the early 1980's and paves the way for a modern and more contemporary reinterpretation of the canon; having a somehow more complex (deeper) storyline compared to the previous one as well as a definite plus over its immediate predecessor which is: David Cumberbatch's nuanced portrayal of the main antagonist Khan whose enhanced voice and ice-blue eyes are likely to ""send shivers upon you!"" While not everyone of the crew impressed me equally - Simon Pegg e.g. whom I couldn't stand in MI: 4, was again quite chatty in a silly fashion in his role as Scotty (I hope he'll find the punch-line in the future productions) and baby-face Chris Pine couldn't live up to William Shetner's charismatic performance as the Captain - I like to point out Zachary Quinto's sophisticated personification of Mr. Spock, whose often disputatious friendship to the Captain contributes much to the dynamics of the entire movie. The other members, especially Karl Urban as the Doc and surprisingly Alice Eve as Carol, could also shine in their roles.The plot, although rather simple with minor exaggerations, was well balanced in terms of the necessity to provide action and excitement with big emotions without dismissing Gene Roddenberry's vision to present an alternative future scenario where the human race is devoted to moral and justice instead of greed and power longing to discover, not destroy. Therefore, I gladly acknowledged Mr. Spock's moral disapproval of having a terrorist killed at the touch of a button without proper trail whereas at the same time in the real world, a ""certain President"" can give a command and automatically, thousands of kilometers away in the desert, a convoy filled with people is getting struck by deadly missiles. I would have wished for more of such bold statements in a sci-fi flick like this reaching out for such a huge viewer-ship, unfortunately this moments of true relevance were rather rare. I hope that in the sequels to come, there will be more room for philosophical and ethical thoughts in the spirit of its original creator: Gene Roddenberry.Finally, what is left to say is that J.J Abram's visionary reviving of such a venerable science fiction saga cannot be valued more, now that he is leaving this engagement; he's done a great job and I'm looking forward to watching the next Star Trek adventure.",Star Trek Into Darkness
401,etherdog,Dreadful direction,5,27 May 2013,"Star Trek has always been a franchise of intellect over action, not that action hasn't been a necessary element in storytelling. I fault JJ Abrams directly for this disappointing, and least effective, addition to the TREK pantheon. The cast was wasted on a storyline that had been told twice before--Khan and his ubermenschen--and a total waste of the great Benedict Cumberbatch. If this movie had been cut to 1 hour 30 minutes, it would have been much better. For instance, the airlock-to-airlock sequence went on far too long with the dodging of debris and the faux tension that they wouldn't make it, let alone the cuts to Scotty (Simon Pegg) on the hangar deck; the gratuitous lingerie scene between Kirk and Carol Marcus; the race to realign the reactor and subsequent saccharin dying scene stolen from a previous film; all of these signs of a lazy director. Fie on you JJ. I had thought perhaps you would elevate the Star Wars movie you were directing, but no, you demeaned TREK. You damaged the franchise, and it will be difficult for it to regain credibility after your disastrous mismanagement of ""Into Darkness"". I should have been so much better, it had the cast and elements of the script that could have made it so. This was a clichéd POS, and only because it is Star Trek do I give it a rating as high as 5.",Star Trek Into Darkness
402,drakula2005,Cooler in every Aspect,8,10 May 2013,"As a non Star Trek fan, i might say i found the film staying as far as possible from that universe, without spoiling all the joy to the followers.J.J. Abrams has a way of doing this and i'm sure he'll do it again with Star Wars, although it is a little strange for one person to be doing probably the most iconic sci-fi movies for two of the most devoted fractions of fan groups, despite the fact they don't like each other-the hardcore fans especially-not one bit.So, on with the film-i must confess i found the first film to be nothing special.Yes, some special effects thrown into it were indeed, spectacular, but the story itself was quite linear and straightforward.No intensity, no tension, only technicalities and quite the strange unit to be honest.It definitely had more for the fans, since it was basically an origins story, and that bugged me as well, because all i wanted was action, clever twists, some wit in the mix, and last, but not least-a great villain (which, albeit an A-lister, Eric Bana sadly isn't).But for god's sake-Benedict Cumberbatch is!The story was quite interesting, more than the first time for sure, some clever writing was involved and finally we get to see Kirk (Pine) and Spock (Quinto) actually act, you know-with real emotions and tears in their eyes.This time the action was more and even more impressive, some of the scenes were real space opera, a poetry of Kubrickan proportions.The tie-ins, as one friend, who's quite the Trekkie said, were quite a few, but this time around more delicately added and that also put a smile on my face.I recommend it to everyone and anyone who loves a good space adventure, even if he/she is not a fan of the series-because of that sole reason alone.Now, the script is more elaborate, more twists are involved and, ahem, John Harrison (Cumberbatch) is probably the best written villain of recent memory.Worthy of a mention are his scene-stealing appearances on the Enterprise as he was locked on the ship.Sherlock just makes acting look a child's play.The film itself is darker as promised, and i will see it again, because so much is happening at once, because it has it's flaws (everyone are superhuman, for instance, jumping back and forth through outer space looks like i can do it tied-handed and blindfolded).But it's moral dilemmas are overwhelming, and some moments are, in that respect, quite unforgettable and special.And for a film who wants to achieve much, greatness even, i believe this is the most important part indeed.It is a)-special, b)- harder to forget and c)just look at Cumberbatch, seriously, look at him.They say good actors are those, who can stay stone cold in one scene, and weep in the next-but he does both things.At once.In a single shot.And also i cannot say i remember anything from Kirk and Spock's first outing back in 2009.Only the technicalities on their ship pre-flight, the multinational flight squad, Anton Yelchin speaking weird (he does it again, but not as irritating) and some scene with a giant fire ray coming over from a planet (which i think , no disrespect, was destroyed- it even might've been Spock's planet, but it made no difference whatsoever, because i was not feeling it, because they were not feeling it).That's all can remember.But now they do, it all looks better emotional-wise and i'm grateful to all of the cast for that.Because of that, this time around, i won't be having the trouble remembering at all!An almost great, independent (from the old-school Star Trek universe) and original film.My rate 8.2/10",Star Trek Into Darkness

For me it is all about the look and feel of the film. If it feels like Star Trek, if it looks like Star Trek, if the Enterprise is completely believable, that's pretty much all I need. I grew up with the original Star Trek so the Enterprise has a very fond place in my heart. I just absolutely love the latest versions of the ship and the CGI is just so utterly fantastic that it's hard to describe. It's so real I want to go sign-up with the Starfleet Academy, but I can't seem to find the address anywhere. The movie itself was fine. Revisiting the old arch enemy was OK.

404,trepessa,"Action, Mystery, Suspense",10,29 September 2014,"I have to say that people seem to want to bash J.J. Abrams and they are totally off the mark. He has the best take on anything Roddenberry. Maybe some didn't watch Earth Final Conflict because what some are saying about his vision isn't entirely true. This movie was not a remake of Khan. It merely had the character as part of the story. I have been a Star Trek fan since it came on the television in the 60s and I watched all the episodes. It didn't last long because it was ahead of its time and didn't get good ratings. I was skeptical about the new cast until I saw the movie prior. This was cast wonderfully and both movies have been great and they are very definitely in the flavor of Mr. Roddenberry. The only movie I didn't like prior to the new cast was Star Trek: The Motion Picture. All the rest were very good. People need to realize movie making has grown. These characters set off as explorers and they would run into all sorts of problems in space. We have a lot of technological advances and this shows up in the two newest versions of Star Trek. They have moved the characters and the shows to a new level. Generations in the 21st Century will not be interested in stories that are totally philosophical. For these movies to do well, we need action and adventure and a modicum of humor for them to make a box office profit. This movie was fabulous and I look forward to more and anyone clearly criticizing them doesn't understand Star Trek and the legacy it has brought to the world. People should quit looking for flaws and live the Star Trek experience that Roddenberry wanted and that was pure entertainment. There was never anything overly different in the shows except likable characters, good actors, and interesting stories. Everything was included in this movie. Mr. Cumberbatch's performance was exemplary and the chemistry between all the reoccurring actors are totally reminiscent of the original series.",Star Trek Into Darkness
405,Forgotten_Conscience_Productions,Star Trek Into Darkness: How far into Darkness can they go?,8,6 June 2013,"The thing about the first Star Trek movie, as made by J.J. Abrams, was that it had some big shoes to fill. Star Trek's legacy has lasted nearly 50 years. From it's very beginnings in the 1960s and the constant threat of near cancellation, through 4 consecutive spinoffs, 3 of which lasted 7 years in length. It already had 6 movies with the original cast and 4 with the Next Generation cast. Not to mention all the various video games, books and other content that's out there for people to absorb. Big shoes to fill might be a massive understatement given the circumstances.Yet J.J. Abrams managed to succeed in giving old and new fans exactly what they want. A film that both respects the legacy of the previous shows, not to mention the one it's based on, and still manages to bring something to it that doesn't require new fans to understand everything about the previous version to enjoy it. J.J. Abrams has often said about the new Star Trek movies that he wanted to bring a sense of Star Wars to the Star Trek universe (a statement that some consider controversial, particularly now that he has been hired to helm the new Star Wars movies) and I think he succeeded on a certain level while maintaining what was great about Star Trek.Personally, I've always been more of a Star Trek fan then a Star Wars fan. I enjoyed both but what attracted me to Star Trek was the sense of morality that was inherent to the way the shows worked. In the 60s, Star Trek was most often about the morality of race relations and the sense of threat that nuclear weapons posed in the face of the Cold War. With Star Trek: TNG, it focused a lot on the post-Cold War mentality, with DS9 there was talk of religious conflict and uncertainty, Voyager was most often about maintaining ideals without the structure to keep them in place, and Enterprise was about where that type of morality begins.The first J.J. Abrams Star Trek movie never really had that moral compass behind it that I recall. I watched it again recently and I wasn't able to figure that part of it out. Thankfully, Star Trek Into Darkness didn't have that problem. It had a clear message of morality to it that was the beating heart of the story. Much like the first one however, it kept that sense of adventure and simplicity to it that made the first one a joy to watch regardless of the level of knowledge you have about the characters and the history that it comes from. It also manages to maintain a sense of humor about itself and that history which long time fans will absolutely love.Particularly when it comes to one aspect of the story which I will not ruin for you and maintain your reason for going to see it if you're a long time Star Trek fan. Suffice to say there are expectations that people have about this film no matter what your level of interest in Star Trek is which are both met and in my opinion exceeded. For the second time J.J. Abrams has created a film that is funny, smart, action packed and emotionally honest. He understands the audience he's catering to and he's not afraid to give them what they want, but he's also not afraid to do the unexpected. He flips some expectations on their head and within the context of the story he's telling it's the best thing he could do.I was concerned that given the title that they were going to take the story into a dark place and shift things to a place where the things I liked about Star Trek don't really apply. With the exception of a noticeable reduction in lens flairs, they haven't done it and thank god for that. There's a reason why J.J. Abrams is one of the hottest directors in Hollywood right now and Star Trek Into Darkness is proof of exactly why.How far into Darkness can they go?

407,colinbarnard-1,"From TOS to POS, Part Duh.... OR.... ""I AM Your Daddy, and This Isn't Trek''",3,21 September 2013,"You get three stars for the fine production values, and Chris Pine's acting, and that's it!So, JJ Abrahms was on 'The Daily Show' on 13 May. He made a number of comments that brought back to me why his first Trek directorial effort was so infuriating for me. And why, thank god, I had no intention of giving Paramount Pictures any money for any more of Abrahms' drek. Seems ole JJ didn't like Trek when he was younger. He couldn't get into it. Too many ideas, it would seem. It was 'too static' because 'they didn't have the money to do anything'. But, 'we have a little bit more money to do things.' He did go on to say that he later watched all the episodes and 'got into it', whatever that means. Probably the paycheque from Paramount, and their publicity department's talking points helped. It should be said that this film is a much better movie than the 2009 film. It is more kinetic, with finer performances from the principle cast. Chris Pine is a fantastic actor, but he is only working with a very few characteristics of Shatner's richer portrayal. But this is still not a Trek film. It is a thin pastiche of vignettes from TWOK with just a sprinkling of references from the TOS episode ""Space Seed"" to ground it in continuity. Lack of continuity with the almost 1000 filmed episodes of Trek that preceded it continues to be its downfall. It would appear that Mr. Abrahms and his writers never read Gene Roddenberry's ""Making of Star Trek"". There, they would have found that the Enterprise was built in orbit, with component parts being built in San Francisco, not in Iowa. It never lands (let alone submerges). Spock mates every 7 years, and was betrothed at birth to T'Pring- the Spock- Uhura relationship is preposterous. Spock served on the Enterprise for 13 years under Christopher Pike before Kirk took command of the ship. And Starfleet is an almost pure exploratory body, not the paramilitary galactic force that Abrahms envisages. The current batch of uniforms, complete with high-brimmed hats, are straight out of NAZI Germany. Star Trek never introduced any hats as parts of their uniforms. Only ST:E had baseball caps to make them more contemporary with current NASA wear.Thanks to one episode of ST:E, we also know that the 23rd Century Klingons whom Kirk and Co. lock horns with, have been genetically altered to look more human. Oooops. The entire alternate timeline that Abrahms uses to retell an already familiar story is blown completely out of the water by the TAS episode ""Yesteryear"" as well as the already established Temporal Police from the Federation's distant future. This is not a Star Trek film. While a finely crafted, fast-moving film that races over its plot-holes (artificial gravity going wonky due to power fluctuations? Just turn it off!), the film works more as Abrahms audition for the role of Star Wars director than any capturing of the ""spirit of Trek"" that Abrahms declares as his creative intention. Don't look for JJ to helm a third Trek- he passed the Lucas audition and has got the gig he really wanted. How about bringing in Ron Moore, J. Michael Strazinski, or Joss Weadon for any future film? Paramount's Publicity Department was in overdrive for the two weeks prior to the film's release, and the week after or so. All the principle cast members, as well as Abrahms himself have been blitzing the American late-night infomercials (er, talk shows). They even managed an infomercial on their own on both the Canadian and American History Channels. A two-hour long infomercial, where Abrahms stated that he deliberately set out to not make a film for Trek lovers, but a film for movie lovers. Its all about bums in seats, you see.This is he end of Part One of this reiew. Apparently, I can only use 1000 words. Sorry, IMDb, I have too much to say....MTC!!!!",Star Trek Into Darkness
408,Kevin-94,"BOLDLY GOING backwards, not forwards.",6,2 June 2013,"It was understandable that the first film of the new ""Trek"" franchise would evoke, to some degree, the originals. That film was a transitional film, a bridge from old to new. And having accomplished that, I was hoping that ""Star Trek Into Darkness"" would carve out its own ideas, stake its own claim and justify itself as a fresh take on the ""Trek"" conventions (no, not those conventions).Instead, if anything, this film is even more reliant on past story ideas than the first film was. And in the final analysis, ""Star Trek: Into Darkness"" can best be characterized as a remake of the classic 1982 film ""Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan."" And why do that? For over thirty years, that film has been available to anyone who wanted it. ""Star Trek 2"" is the best Trek film ever. It has a wonderful blend of action, character and original science fiction ideas. It also has enormous heart and interesting themes about aging, death and the costs of maturity. This film evokes the basic outline but none of what made that film great.In interviews, the filmmakers refused to say the identity of the character played (very well) by Benedict Cumberbach, but said it was a famous Trek villain. It's a short list: Harry Mudd (who gets a shout out here), Q and Khan. At first, I thought it might be Q. Cumberbach more closely evokes John DeLancie than Ricardo Montalban. And that would be a neat surprise, since everyone in the audience would be assuming Khan. (And the fact that Q is not part of the Kirk ""Trek"" universe would be a neat surprise too.) It couldn't be Khan, I thought to myself. That was just be too obvious. Surely, the filmmakers have something far more interesting up their sleeve.Alas, just as smoke is indicative of fire, the revelation that the villain is Khan falls entirely flat. It's about a surprising as the revelation in ""Indy 4"" of who Mutt's father was.Cumberbatch is fun in his way, but I wished the writers had given him more to do, other than arch his eyebrows and speak the usual bad guy rantings in his melodious British voice. Montalban's Khan was a Shakespearian figure. He was angry, funny, sexy, soulful and, in the end, totally crazy and sadly tragic. (Nicholas Meyer, the film's director and co-writer was a Shakespearian scholar.) Cumberbatch is a cool actor but his villain is too one note, in the end, to register much.As the film goes on, the references to ""Star Trek II"" pile on and on, until it becomes clear that this film is pretty much a straight up remake. There are some vague attempts to inject some fresh variations. (It's Kirk, not Spock who risks his life, etc.) But disappointment sets in as time goes on and the film fails to evoke any fresh ideas. The pile up of references and shout outs made me feel like I was watching a ""Simpsons"" Halloween episode parody. Spock's pained ""Khaaaan!!"" lament was the jump the shark moment, and it drew huge laughs at the screening I attended.I enjoyed the film's action sequences, but I'm hoping that future ""Trek"" films will dial down the homage to the originals, and dial up the new and original ideas. The time has come to stop recycling and start creating. For a franchise that boldly boasts of ""new frontiers,"" this chapter is sadly derivative.",Star Trek Into Darkness

If you like dramatic music, you will probably like it.

Even with the unexpected twists, one as an audience would always know where the outline is headed, which can make it dull. But what clearly over-shadows such shortcomings are the various layers. Just when you think it's all going to be capturing or fighting off John Harrison, you come across the Marcus shade, after that the Harrison betrayal and then the retaining of cryo-pods. Still not to assume it's over, it has an enjoyable chase sequence between Spock and Harrison where at the end Spock's asked to keep him alive to use his blood as a cure.It does not carry the whole film in one motive or few surprising twists like most conventional action-thrillers do but keeps us engaged through out with constant new developments. If Iron-Man 3 was a pure pop-corn entertainer, this one's where you won't have time to have one. (imeansuraj.blogspot.in)",Star Trek Into Darkness
411,russmillerwy-957-682439,"TOO much action, not enough of anything else",5,21 May 2013,"The Star Trek franchise is, unfortunately, falling into the same trap the Star Wars movies once did. George Lucas, at the peak of his success, wisely pointed out that a special effect without a story is a very boring thing-- then forgot his own lesson and overdid the special effects in his last three films at the expense of story and characters. I'm sure when JJ Abrams and his crew do interviews about what they've done for Star Trek, they brag about how much action they've been able to pack into a mere two hours of screen time. The problem is fast-paced hand-to-hand combat can be a very boring thing when you always know who's going to win. If the outcome is bound to be a happy ending, why not take some more time for the characters to have interesting conversations, explore strange new worlds, and the like? James Kirk, once a romanticized character, has been replaced by a bratty, brash bad boy who specializes in one night stands, not romance. That's what the new Star Trek films remind me of, a series of standalone one-night stands full of sound and fury, which are ultimately meaningless, soulless, and unmemorable. Nice special effects, granted, and pretty good casting, but there's just no there there. It might as well be a music video.",Star Trek Into Darkness
412,patrickmmc,Trekked Right Out The Door,1,10 September 2013,"This movie was so painful to watch, I trekked right out of the theater just barley half way through. I grew up with Star Trek, and anyone else who grew up with it will have a hard time sitting through this garbage. Abrams has taken every liberty possible to create some warped idea of what he thinks Star Trek should be. He gives no devotion to the original series and insults the intelligence of all who venture to his films, not just Star Trek. Abrams should be banned from making movies ever again. I'm not sure who he thinks he is, but original and creative, he is not. His works are adolescent at best. His characters are little more than the same. Speaking of adolescent, Christopher Pine portrays Kirk as an over indulged, spoiled brat of a punk teenager, and destroys the suave, confident and capable character made by William Shatner. Abrams' attempt to make Spock more human and add romance to his character is outrageous and ridiculously unnecessary. The entire cast tries hard to portray the original crew, but fall hard on their faces in this mindless plethora of nothing but video game action and explosions. Again, special effects take front seat while story and plot fall far to the back. Thanks JJ for ruining my and so many other's memory of a great and classic piece of sci-fi history.",Star Trek Into Darkness
413,vaultoverseer_15,Worst of the New Star Trek,2,26 July 2019,"NOTE: I'm not a huge fan of star trek, I've only seen the movies (none of the Next Gen ones excluding First Contact) - it doesn't mean I dislike Star Trek I just haven't seen that muchOut of all the rebooted Star Trek movies this is easily the worst. There are a lot of reasons, but one thing I'd like to clarify is that it has nothing to do with the fact that this is an over the top action film which isn't really what Star Trek is like. I liked both Star Trek 09 and Beyond. There are three main problems I have with this movie that hold me back from really liking it, which is unfortunate because there are definitely things I like.1. The film has too much action to the point as to where it is exhausting and no longer interesting. The action is actually all well done, and I think the action from the point at which the Vengeance comes is all exhilarating and great. The problem? For the last hour the film has also been nothing but action. You can have a fast paced action movie but ultimately there needs to be some sort of build up to when all the action breaks out. It's why, for example, the action in Avengers is better than it is in Age of Ultron. So the action at the end ultimately starts to bore you by the end because there has just been so much action before. Ultimately as well, it's basically the same even despite different action set pieces. The camera just whips around everywhere to the point where it becomes nautious and by the end when the action is at its peak you are too bored to care.2. References and Khan. I like Benedict Cumberbatch as super human bad guy, but he is not Khan Noonien Singh. This was completely unnecessary and doesn't really make any sense at all - so the Kelvin timeline means that Khan has a completely different race and accent? It's not to do with whitewashing or whatever - it doesn't make any sense within this universe, and it is so pointless. I guess the point is you are supposed to know he is more dangerous because of Wrath of Khan and that someone will probably die. I didn't like it at all because ultimately it was a different plot with different themes, we didn't need this reference. It's ok to be your own thing. The decision to fake out Kirk's death and make it exactly like Spock's death lessened that so much to the point where I didn't care at all - and considering you are being told about magic blood do you really expect him to die? Spock's death in Khan worked because it actually seemed like they killed him off until III, and gave that story which was ultimately a pretty smale scale story some importance in this universe. This movie already had a lot of things happened that it created on its own and didn't need this fake out death to give it more importance. It sucks to me because ultimately as this is the Kelvin timeline they could kill of Kirk for an emotional impact but now they definitely won't.Otherwise, it's an intriguing plot which shows this universe getting darker, topped off with great actors and good action - but there is just too much action. Ultimately, it's a movie where you should watch the good scenes on youtube rather than the whole thing otherwise you will turn insane.",Star Trek Into Darkness
414,generationfilm,Star Trek Into Darkness- A Polished and Entertaining Sequel That Remains Consistent to J.J. Abrams' Reimagining of a Space Opera Focused Star Trek,8,16 May 2013,"When director J.J. Abrams set out to recreate the beloved Gene Rodenberry television series ""Star Trek"" into a new cinematic franchise it was clear he didn't want to be dogmatically chained to the original material as if it were an untouchable gospel, a direction some die hard Trekkie fans found a tad sacrilegious. Setting up a rival timeline of events in his first Star Trek as the foundation within his film universe Abrams opened up the potential creative possibilities of rethinking the origins of the series but riskily teetered on the tightrope that balanced between modern audience accessibility and adored fan homage. The first installment of Star Trek was undeniably entertaining and kinetically exciting despite the fact that the highbrow philosophical humanist reflections of the original series were cheapened for space opera theatrics. This is the same expected fate for J.J. Abrams polished sequel Star Trek: Into Darkness, an energetic action blockbuster with chaos, laughs, and explosions to spare that still has momentary slivers of thin moral reflections on the differences between retribution and genuine justice. Returning screenwriters Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman are joined this time by LOST co-creator Damon Lindelof to construct a more than familiar plot line that may go where numerous other films have gone before but it does the familiar with a spectacularly assured confidence. Though there is some provocative content involving the threat of terrorism and the potential for losing one's conscience in the face of evil most of that intriguing premise is completely secondary to the immense spectacle of action that fills the screen. Comparing the dissimilarities between the original series and the new franchise would be a daunting task but it's unnecessary because this is a revision of the universe that keeps faith to the original characters, which is the only element that should have any nitpicky concern. Excessively logical Vulcan criticism might have to reserved for another time because Star Trek: Into Darkness fulfills most of the skeptical expectations through its nostalgic consistency to provide a mixture of thrilling action, shallow yet relevant contemplation, and an intriguing twist of character role reversals that makes it a summer blockbuster worth venturing.Read more: http://wp.me/py8op-yp, More reviews: generationfilm.net",Star Trek Into Darkness
415,kitchent,J.J. Doesn't Get It,2,7 October 2013,"I know I'll sound like an old guy, but J.J. Abrams just doesn't get Star Trek. Maybe that's just fine because he is searching for a new and younger audience that probably doesn't get Star Trek either. Star Trek was never about the special effects or action. Most of the best Trek stories from all of the television shows (TOS through Enterprise) didn't rely on either. Action and special effects were always there, but they were used to tell a story instead of becoming the story. To be fair, there is one thing to like about the new Star Trek reboot. The cast is great, and it is easy to see the original actors through them. After that, I'm over this thing. It is just an action movie series using Star Trek's name to sell tickets. If you think this is great science fiction in the Star Trek universe, then enjoy it. If you are looking for something more and want to really understand what Star Trek is about then queue up ""Measure of a Man"" from TNG, just one of many classic Star Trek episodes that expose this new ""reboot"" for the sham that it is. Gene Roddenberry would be ashamed.",Star Trek Into Darkness

Having said that I've seen all the original Star Trek movies with Shatner and Nimoy and this is probably better than those to the average viewer. Unlike the comically bad ""Dr. Who"" quality special effects, this film has been dragged kicking and screaming into the 21st century of CG.That's where the good stops unfortunately. There is no acting (even the villain) noteworthy in the film. There is no groundbreaking script writing or story telling or directing here.Unlike many viewers who compare it to Die Hard, I found it more closely resembled a Bond film. Don't get me wrong, it isn't BAD. It isn't good. Its just another movie. A chance to keep your $$ flowing to Hollywood. And with its $300+ million price tag, this might turn out to be a $ loser.

417,licktheenvelope,Big Time Trek/Sci-Fi fans are missing the point...,9,17 May 2013,"So I feel I have to get my 'Trek Cred' out of the way here. I am not a 'Trekkie' in the true-est sense as I have only glanced at the books and the expanded Trek universe, however I was big into the Next Generation when I was young for a brief time and last year took it upon myself to go back and watch every series of Trek + every movie in the order they came out... and I did it.I have a better admiration for a series like Deep Space 9 than before and even the original Trek... although the original Trek is far, far more campy than some seem to think it was...Today we see that movies are having a hard time with stories. Across the board TV has become the new avenue for telling a good story (Game of Thrones as an example) because they have so much more time to develop the characters and the world.The tricky part with this Star-Trek re-boot is that JJ had to take all these existing characters and attempt to appease the original fans and bring in new fans by changing it enough to not just make each movie a science or lore lesson.This movie, for me, was a solid 8. It's not the best Trek movie and it's not even close to the worst (hello Generations...).I'm also quite surprised at the comments that complain about this vs Star Trek 2... where this one made some sense... but don't mention that Star Trek Nemesis was actually a worse rip-off in every sense and a far worse film...My only one complaint was that this film didn't have a well done space-battle like in Star-Trek 2. That battle Kirk vs Khan was handled better than I think any battle i've seen in any Trek and I was hoping to see something as interesting as that.Overall the acting is great, plot is fine, action/CG is good but over-the-top, throw-backs worked well... it is a little bit of a shame that Trek has been turned into Science-Fantasy/Action from Science Fiction but I think it holds just fine.9 Posted to offset some of the ridiculous 2 scores, unless all those people want to go back and give Nemesis a 0.",Star Trek Into Darkness
418,johnfuen,Great Fun....ignore the nit pickers,10,19 May 2013,"Maybe I'm just easily entertained. Maybe I just enjoy big action science fiction movies so much that I am willing to over look what I consider minor imperfections. I am a die hard Star Trek fan who can trace his love for the show all the way back to the original run of the original series. Captain Kirk, Mr. Spock, ""Bones"" McCoy and the rest of the crew of the fictional star ship always kept me entertained no matter how bad some of the scripts were. And believe me...I do recall some bad bad episodes...the Space Hippies episode comes to mind. But I digress.Yes....this was pretty much a non stop action ride. Yes it had some holes in the script. Yes it had some clichés. But I enjoyed the action. I enjoyed the acting....yes I said the acting. Brendan whats his name (I am afraid to write his last name for fear of misspelling it) stole the show as ""John Harrison aka....oohps....can't say that name"" as the main villain. But Chris Pine as Kirk and Zachery Quinto as Spock had their acting moments too. The supporting cast also had their moments too.As to the nit pickers who dissect such minor points as the use of such expressions as ""my God"" and ""Good God""....give me a break. I can't swear to it but I do believe that those expressions may have been used in the original show.

419,manshstudio,Another Epic Blockbuster but not perfect 3D,9,12 May 2013,I just realized I saw this film in theatre while it still remains unreleased in many countries thats cool.Coming back to the movie I had very high anticipation from this one and I had got a ticket after going to house full shows everywhere. The previous movie from jj abrams was simply perfect. It was totally engrossing and the big fights and giant location justified the title.So I had high expectations from him but for some reason I feel it could have been much better. To start of 3D was some of the worst I had ever seen. May be jj abrams should take a lesson from makers of life of pi who made 3d thats was beautiful. In star trek from the very start there is no real sense of depth. Fast moving actors were just blurring out. So my first recommendation is watch it in 2D.The film starts really good with new character but later the whole film becomes a one man hunt. There are no epic battles no visual splendor. And last 20 minutes are just a drag to compensate for lack of action earlier.So I would like jj abrams to make the next within this year I cannot wait for the next one.And kindly make it as good as first one,Star Trek Into Darkness
420,ZChrisJ1995,Solid Sci-fi Escapism,8,22 May 2013,"After a four year hiatus, J.J. Abrams has brought out a sequel to the critically acclaimed Star Trek reboot, and on the whole it is a satisfying return, if not as fresh.After a series of terrorist attacks by former Starfleet agent ""John Harrison"" (Benedict Cumberbatch), the crew of the starship Enterprise launch a mission to retrieve the fugitive and make him face justice. As can be implied, there is more to Harrison's plot than mere anarchy, and returning leads Kirk (Chris Pine) and Spock (Zachary Quinto), are forced to face their own motivations and allegiances in this high-stakes sci-fi adventure.What is always good about sequels is that, having already introduced the primary characters, the film can warp straight ahead (see what I did there) into the narrative. In doing so, we are treated to an awesome opening sequence, in which the Enterprise's crew must save a primitive civilization from an erupting volcano. This gives an idea of the overall pace of the film, one that hardly relents in its breakneck speed and overall aura of suspense and excitement.The clash between Kirk's hot-headed approach to problems and Spock's logical conclusions is no longer one of the primary focuses of the film, though their unusual relationship is still covered, with humorous results. Scotty (Simon Pegg) is in fine form once again as a strong source of the film's comedy. Other crew members, such as Chekov (Anton Yelchin) and Sulu (John Cho), aren't given an awful lot of screen time, which is to be expected in a film that has just over two hours to explore multiple planets and plot devices.The real highlight in terms of performances, however, is Benedict Cumberbatch as the elusive John Harrison, who obviously has much more significance in the Star Trek continuity than his name initially implies. Harrison is both brutal and demented, as well as sophisticated and ingenious, a kind of warped, evil version of the Sherlock Holmes that he is renowned for playing.Michael Giacchino's score, as in the first film, is utterly fantastic, evoking the tone of epic swashbucklers and classic 80's blockbusters. The set pieces as well are well above the quality of those in most recent multimillion dollar action films. There is the odd moment where a reference to previous Star Trek films or series a thrown in awkwardly, though this is only sporadic.On the whole, Star Trek Into Darkness is a commendable, solid action-adventure which I would rank more or less on par with its 2009 prequel, with highlights including Cumberbatch's performance, and the scale of some of the action sequences. I would recommend this for most cinema-goers who are looking for a fun escape that has a great balance of humour and action, something which J.J. Abrams has pulled off successfully numerous times.Final note: Though not ESSENTIAL, I would recommend viewing the 2009 film if you have not already. It gives a proper introduction to many of this film's characters and provides a proper context for the reboot series' continuity.",Star Trek Into Darkness
421,TomTomH,Spectacular!,7,6 June 2013,"J.J. Abrams' 2009 reboot was slightly disappointing for me. I felt that it needed a little bit of an extra boost of action to keep science-fiction\action film lovers (like me but except I like not love it) occupied with the system. After 4 years, it's surprisingly and (I think for many) expected sequel arrives to prove that a follow-up to a successful movie could be more successful and approval over the first outing and yes J.J. you've done it this time!""Star Trek Into Darkness"" is a knockout sequel which overlaps the action and excitement of it's predecessor. I never watched the original ""Star Trek"" series but anyone who's a newcomer, like me, to ""Trek"" you should give this a go.The ensemble cast return again as the young vision of the Star Trek team (Chris Pine: Kirk, Zachary Quinto: Spock, Zoe Saldana: Nyota Uhura, Simon Pegg: Scotty, Karl Urban: ""Bones"" McCoy, John Cho: Sulu, and Bruce Greenwood as Christopher Pike) with 'Trek' newcomer Alice Eve (Carol Marcus) on board. ""Sherlock""'s Benedict Cumberbatch portrays Kahn, the next suspicious and dark villain (after the strange and average villain Nero, portrayed by Eric Bana in the predecessor) who wants to destroy Earth, without making any spoilers at all. I must admit he's quite good at playing Kahn and even especially for Simon Pegg, who plays Scotty. He's got a bigger part in this than the first entry, even funnier, in which is what Pegg's normally like. He isn't as brilliant as in his films with Nick Frost (Paul, Hot Fuzz and hopefully in the upcoming The World's End) but he's still quite good.The special effects are dazzling. You see shots of CGI London in 2000 years away from skyscraper view which works well with the 3D. You can see St. Paul's Cathedral (I didn't see it) still hanging there if you take a lookout (this isn't a spoiler it's a hint). There's many futuristic buildings lying around to make it look like a typical futuristic city unlike in present day. Did I mention the 3D? Yes I did. And just to let you know the 3D is incredible. Like with the special effects it stands out with the film and introducing the world of ""Star Trek"" to non-Trekkies (like me) in an exciting way. According to Abrams, they shot the film in Imax (which probably has some very good Imax shots) and converting the film into 3D during post-production, expecting the experience to be slightly ruined by the unnecessary use of 3D because believe me, I seen many films at the cinema that have bad uses of 3D (like Gulliver's Travels and Narnia 3 and many more which I can't think of), but unbelievably, I've never seen any converted-3D film as good as this. And because of this, this is one of the best films I've seen in 3D, and the first 3D film in converted 3D which I like the most. Especially Abrams' lens flare trick (read Abrams' Empire issue for info) which works well with the 3D (look out for that as well).Abrams boosts some exciting, thrilling and noisy action sequences to the film, more powerful than it's predecessor's. But UNLIKE it's predecessor, other than the gun and Enterprise fights, the face-to-face fight scenes are just brutal. Just punches until it goes too far. Probably Abrams' writers, Robert Orci & Alex Kurtzman (Transformers 1&2) and Damon Lindelof, wanted to add more violence to make it more thrilling. No luck, just unnecessary (you'll understand once you're watching it). Don't be disappointed. You'll agree.There's still plenty Enterprise ship battles, Abrams hasn't left those bits out. Goodness no he hasn't.Just to remind you, this isn't Star Wars from George Lucas. It's Star Trek from J.J Abrams. Speaking of which, Abrams is going to helm ""Episode VII"" next. Don't you just think for a minute that Abrams slow down with science fiction?It may be the start of Summer 2013 according to rumours, but ""Darkness"" could be part of the beginning of it. It's a summer blockbuster that packs a powerful villain (played by a professional actor) an understanding (and maybe sometimes be incomprehensibly confusing) plot and good and exciting action and 3D (that'll quite possibly turn up in upcoming action blockbusters (such as Pacific Rim, Man of Steel and more). Out of everything I've said about this film, it's a successful and must-see sequel you should catch in the cinema before it's too late because (I think) it's the only best experience for it (I saw this before May Half Term so I'm sending in a late review).",Star Trek Into Darkness

Kirk-Spock once again create magic with their unmatched chemistry; and helm the Enterprise throughout the film. They are well by supported by Bones, Scotty, Uhura, Sulu, Pike, and newly added Admiral and Khan. The strongest aspects of film, that will impact the Trekkies most, are: Kirk's undying love for his family--The Crew of Enterprise, andSpock's unbreakable bond with his captain—severance of which is one of the few things that induces an explicit emotion in the inherently uptight Vulcan. *********Perhaps a minor spoiler but by the time film ends, it won't remain a spoiler for you*********************Kirk's desperation/sacrifice to save his crew; and Spock venting his anger at Kirk's demise showcases both these aspects beautifully. Scotty and Bones are also there to lighten up the atmosphere every now and then with decent comic touches. *********************************************************Only slight disappointment is under-utilizing, under-developing the character of superhuman 'Kahn Noonien Singh' (like it happened with Nero in previous installation)—Benedict Cumberbatch certainly showed he could match up to the 'Khan' of Ricardo Montalbán, if not better him.When J.J. Abrams revived Star Trek, it definitely seemed like beginning of next big Hollywood venture that will be deemed an epic in years to come, and Trekkies should be happy to see a steady sequel following up a super successful re-launch of 2009. Of course, the film isn't as magnificent as the first one, but it keeps the old fans engaged and opens the doors of Starfleet for a new crop of younger fans. Without a doubt, the new generation of Trekkies will enjoy the company of Bones, Scotty, Uhura, Sulu, Pike, along with Captain Kirk and First Officer Spock in upcoming films, all the while; BGM of Star Trek rushing their adrenaline.Film is technically sound too, especially the post-production 3D job is quite commendable.

423,jacob-m-ford97,A Disappointment,7,26 May 2013,"Star Trek Into Darkness was releases last week of 2013 and is the sequel to 2009′s Star Trek remake. After the success in 2009, J.J. Abrams and his crew had very large shoes to fill, and didn't necessarily do the job. As much as I wanted to love this movie, it being a sequel to Star Trek and casting one of my favorite actors as the largest Star Trek villain of all time, sadly I was severely disappointed.The acting was the strong point of this movie, aside from the special effects. These actors had done an excellent job playing these legendary characters in 2009, and had the great opportunity of reprising their roles. All of the returning actors, specifically Zachary Quinto and Simon Pegg, did very good work in their return to space making Into Darkness still and enjoyable film. The only newcomer to the leading cast was Benedict Cumberbatch playing the great Khan (I would say Spoiler Alert except everyone already knew this was going to happen.) Cumberbatch is one of my favorite currently rising actors, I have especially enjoyed him in the BBC miniseries Sherlock and in 2011′s Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy, so I was very anxious to see him take on a role in the Sci-Fi spectrum. Again I was disappointed, not because Cumberbatch wasn't good, honestly he did the best with what he was given, but because the writers seemed to really bring his character down. Which brings me to my next point.In 2009, the greatest strength of Star Trek was the writers and their ability to imitate the original TV series while adding modern intrigue. In 2013 however, the writing failed and brought down the movie entirely, even though it was the exact same writers with the addition of Damon Lindelof. One of the most enjoyable parts of Star Trek in 2009 was the almost perfect replication of the characters, creating dialogue and situations that reflected the characters all those Trekkies knew so well. This success was dropped for Into Darkness, as it seemed the writers made the severe mistake of imitating the characters from 2009 rather than imitating the original characters, allowing the very few mistakes from 2009 to be maximized. The story also dropped calibers. In the remake, a very complex story that was still easy to follow and reflected all the characters personalities perfectly, yet still being believable circumstances, was made, which essentially made the movie the success it was. For Into Darkness though, the story was mediocre with often clichéd scenes, that made the story predictable and even boring. The best idea for the story was to bring the character of Khan back, which was a good idea, but that's as far as they got. Their follow through with Khan was very lousy, he was actually hardly in the movie at all. When his character was defeated, which was in a rather inconsistent way for his character, I was very surprised as I thought that the movie had plenty of time left, until I looked at my watch and realized that I had been watching zero plot or character development for two hours. Unfortunately, director J.J. Abrams never seemed to step in and make this script that had been written poorly a success, as I realize more and more that Abrams is a technical director and seems to focus more on the special effects of the film. Which I must note, was very good.I really wanted Star Trek Into Darkness to be very good; I loved Star Trek from 2009 and the fact that they had brought Benedict Cumberbatch into the mix for the sequel excited me even more. However, I was not pleased by the product of the film-makers, and was overall very let down. Oscar nomination have not yet come out for this year, and won't for a number of months, but any real Academy Awards success for this film is unlikely. It will probably pick up some nominations for visual effects and sound work, but definitely nothing else.I give Star Trek Into Darkness a very disappointed 7.3/10",Star Trek Into Darkness

Given the task of fighting a one man war machine the crew set about their usual tasks of teaming up to combat a united enemy. It starts off at a frantic pace and rarely slows down. The characters are as edgy as ever and the story flows with life. You'll enjoy the dialogue special effects and if watched in IMAX3D you'll particularly enjoy the big action sequences. Although it may not have been shot in 3D the transformation is bad at all. It's full of plenty references to the original movies enough to satisfy all the Trekkies out there. With a few surprising recall of past characters you be more than satisfied on the final product. The acting was bang on and script well developed. It really has left me wanting to see a few more installments as the stories are endless. Unlike many other sequels there wasn't any overkill on trying to please the viewers with dreary dialogue it was catering to a smart audience and was very well received.

425,thedudeabides-2,Very disappointing when you consider what came before,5,31 July 2014,"In 2009, J.J Abrams changed the world's perception of Star Trek. Once thought of as a cult TV show with an extremely dedicated fanbase who were a little too boisterous in their admiration for it, Star Trek is now a million dollar blockbuster franchise with cinema screens filled with trekkies and non-trekkies alike. It's an admirable achievement considering how divisive the show is and it's clear that Abrams has decided on a more commercially friendly tone, with a number of explosive set pieces punctuating the drama. This was completely fine in the first Abrams movie, because the plot was interesting enough to keep the viewer engaged in what was going on. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for Into Darkness. Falling into the sequel trap of 'bigger is better', Abrams fills the screen with tons of beautiful CGI, explosions that would make Micheal Bay weep and even a few gratuitous shots of scantily clad women. Unfortunately, he has forgotten to include interesting characters and a decent story. To be fair to Abrams, it is really the script, rather than the direction, which stops the movie from being good. Rather than a standalone movie, it often feels like a simple Star Trek checklist which is trying to include every iconic staple of the show; so we have Klingons, Leonard Nimoy as Spock, 'Bones' McCoy saying 'Dammit' a lot and an unapologetic rip off of The Wrath Of Khan. It's even harder to take when you realise there is enough here to flesh out a really good plot with high stakes. It starts off well, with Benedict Cumberbatch launching a terrorist attack against Starfleet, and Kirk and Spock sent to stop him. At first it seems like Abrams may be bringing some political, real world situations into his Trek universe but, once we know Cumberbatch's true motives, it quickly devolves into an incoherent mess with the impressive action being the only reason to keep watching. A very disappointing blockbuster which seems to have forgotten the merits of a well told story.

Like its 2009 predecessor, this movie is not the enlightened future Roddenberry envisioned and has more plot-holes than your average swiss-cheese. And again it really didn't matter to me, because it was just a fun ride. Like the first movie, I liked the action so much so (still way too much lens-flares, though), that many of the plot-holes only became obvious to me, after I took a few moments to think about the movie. But basically, if you can make a movie so entertaining, that you don't notice all the plot holes on your first watch and be entertained, it is still a good movie. I assume that is also the reason why the most reviews here either hate it or really like it: People who like the ""Star Trek""-legacy and would like to see it continued are severely disappointed by this movie. But people who don't care about Roddenberrys ""better future"" or see the ""Star Trek""-legacy as ""redshirts dying"", ""too tight uniforms"" and ""technobabble"", enjoy this flick as a good popcorn movie.So if you still need to see this movie, do not expect ""Star Trek""... expect the kind of action you wanted the ""Star Wars"" prequels to be.",Star Trek Into Darkness
427,jkm0119,If you really want a laugh at sci-fi watch this movie,3,15 May 2014,"This movie is an insult to those who liked Star Trek. For those in the generation of ""Star Trek the next Generation"" It might be good. I would have thought Hollywood could have done better with everything. This is a B movie with only one or two actors in it. The acting was very bad and the special effects were worse than the first Star Trek Movie which did not have many special effects. If you can get past the first 20 minutes, it gets better until the next 30 minutes. So there is actually 30 minutes of this film worth watching and the story? What story? This is one of the poorest films I have seen. If you are a pot head you may enjoy it but get really stoned first. If you have a brain and like action or science fiction, this is one of the worse movies ever made by the company who has the Star Trek name. In this movie, Spock is just an idiot robot, If you liked Spock, forget this movie. If you like Captain Kirk, forget this Movie. The cast is wrong. The actors are wrong. I can only say that for 30 minutes of an over 2 hour movie I did not want to shut it off.

428,nflores342,Bold and Brilliant,10,1 June 2013,"Very rarely do I give such a high ranking score to a film (the last being The Dark Knight in 2008)because there are usually certain aspects that are missing, don't work, or the film just wasn't good at all. I'm happy to report that this film was fantastic, like anything else there are people who would disagree with me and say i'm delusional, but everyone has their tastes.While i'm not a true Trekkie in the sense that I haven't watched the original series and films (i'm doing it now), I consider my self a Trekkie at heart, and fell in love with the 2009 Star Trek reboot. A known fact in films is a sequel usually doesn't live up to the original and while the 2009 film was great, Into Darkness was sublime.The pros: the fact that JJ Abrams took his time making this film (3 years) truly shows the attention to detail and passion he has when making his films.The acting was great, and the new additions into the cast helped make the film that much better, but most noticeably Benedict Cumberbatches character John Harrison, his character is in the same league as Heath Ledgers Joker. And while slightly cheesy at times, the script was great, despite what some say, I feel the essence of the original series seep into the script with it's witty one liners and cute linesThe costumes and sets had to be even more exquisite than in the original, and they very much were;they were exciting and realistic and made the film a great ride.The cons: The only negative thing I have to say about this movie is that I have to wait another 3 years for the next film :)Go watch it, that is all I can say it literally has everything a moviegoer wants(except horror): romance, suspense, action, comedy, and drama, a perfect blend that gives you a fantastic, action packed film.",Star Trek Into Darkness
429,Semmy-tones,Just WOW!!!,10,11 May 2013,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***Into darkness explores a contemporary array of topics, philosophies and concerns including heroism, terrorism, fascism and interracial relationships. All this is set against a backdrop of warp factor 9, leaping off star ships into space, running away from erupting volcano's and deactivating lethal bombs within milliseconds to detonation.The main playoff of characters revolves around Spock's rule abiding inflexible Vulcan logic versus Khan (Benedict Cumberbach) as a dark and brilliantly manipulative galactic terrorist. Loyal followers of Cumberbach as Sherlock Holmes may find themselves longing for an element of morality in this ruthless fanatic but ultimately there is none. Cumberbach, Zachary Quinto and Chris Pine as the impulsive hot-headed Kirk who leaps before he thinks and ultimately makes life saving decisions from his gut, compete with equal excellence to steal the show. There is intensity, passion and great interpretation of what I thought to be a faultless script. But if I had to pick a winner, I would say in this instance, it would be Zachary Quinto who's portrayal of Spock is almost flawless – (I say almost because Leonard Nimoy IS Spock and always will be).My only slight question would be around the saving the ship scene where Captain Kirk gives his life for the 'needs of the many', which in the original 'Wrath of Khan' was a role reserved strictly for Spock – creating the famous sequel 'The Search for Spock'. The scene suggests a following of the original set of 6 films – or was it perhaps just a little dipping into the original? We shall see with what follows in 2016.To conclude, 'Into Darkness' is a thrilling joy ride of nonstop edge of your seat action sequences that are perfectly filmed and executed under JJ Abram's skillful and enthusiastic directorship which is getting to be seriously impressive. Whilst containing jaw dropping action and effects, it loses none of the humour of the original films and still plays off the characters with as much wit as ever. Karl Urban and Simon Pegg are true to form as the moaning Dr McCoy and the ever practical Scotty. But this movie surpasses every other Star Trek movie with a brand new slicker, faster, louder and very well acted take on the classic Sci-fi movies that I grew up with.Although it remains true to form, make no mistake, this has a much wider box office appeal which will shunt Star Trek into a new era and probably spawn a new not so geeky following. So in conclusion, Trekie or not, if you like action, great effects and pure entertainment you're going to love this film. Seriously recommended! I wanted to watch it again the minute the credits rolled. 10/10",Star Trek Into Darkness

Nothing about the plot makes sense, especially since the post Nero continuity is supposed to diverge from the old continuity at the destruction of the Kelvin, so how the philippin eck does Khan go from being brown to a snowflake?Well the answer is that the folk who made the flick, don't actually care about continuity it's just a franchise, like the one at the front of the picture house selling hot dogs, popcorn and fizzy drinks with too much ice at inflated prices.

Now let's get to the story, well John Harrison is vengeful because a Star Fleet commander with an industrial military complex had something he wants and has use him for it. John Harrison is vengeful and he wants his family back, he would do anything for his family. Kirk is reckoned by an enemy that is stronger, smarter, faster and more than he will ever know or have met. Indeed, John Harrisson is better, at what? At everything. But Spock is as good. There are good effects, good fights, good dramatic moments, even Spock, the stoic Spock, sheds a tear or two. Good film, 4 and half stars, I am sure I will see this film again.

432,tomassparups,Fulfilling..,8,16 July 2013,"""Star Trek: Into Darkness"" is the highly anticipated sequel J.J. Abrams' 2009 reboot of the ""Star Trek"" franchise. After the events of ""Star Trek"" the crew of the USS ""Enterprise"" have returned to their regular routine. They are sent to a distant planet to observe an alien race. Their mission goes terribly wrong as a natural disaster threatens the lives of the planet's indigenous civilization. In efforts to protect the planet, the ship's first officer Spock tries to control the situation, but his life is soon in grave danger. Captain James T. Kirk is forced to disobey the ""Prime Directive"" to safe Spock's life and exposes the enterprise to the planet's civilization. Upon returning to the starfleet's headquarters, Kirk is stripped of his position as ship captain, but is appointed as the first officer to admiral Montgomery Pike, who takes Kirk's place as commanding officer of the ""Enterprise"". Parallel to this, an unknown terrorist is plotting an attack that not only threatens the safety of the starfleet, but the entire ""Galactic Federation""Despite director J.J. Abrams overly stylistic direction, I immensely enjoyed ""Star Trek: Into Darkness"". The awe-inspiring action sequences gave me chills and Benedict Cumberbatch's performance was excellent. His voice literally made his character so great. When I went out of the theater, I wasn't sure if I liked the film, but now after some consideration I have come to the conclusion that I loved it. Even though it is action packed, it still provides a great story and plenty of substance to keep the viewer engrossed all the way through the film (though it dragged on a bit close to the end). Often times big budget action films have mediocre acting, again this is not the case with this film. The entire cast provides good performances, but Benedict Cumberbatch stole the show.I don't have a whole lot to say about this film other than it had great special effects, great action, great pacing and great characters. The only downside was that towards the end the film dragged on a bit. Other than that, ""Star Trek: Into Darkness"" is another win on the behalf of director, J.J. Abrams.",Star Trek Into Darkness
433,Caesarboy5,Into Darkness is an Exceptional Film,9,15 September 2013,"Light Spoilers: Won't Ruin Anything Into Darkness is an Exceptional Film. Movie's of it's genre (action-adventure) are barely done this well in this day and age. They're usually subject to easy praise that they don't deserve (Captain America, The Avengers, etc...) which makes me avoid them at all cost. This film, though... It's like a carefully crafted 1970's action-adventure film made in the age of CGI.Some people don't like this style because it isn't the original Star Trek. I get where they're coming from. This film is more like Indiana Jones in space with a Star Trek theme than the original Star Trek films. But honestly, it's too late to complain about that as the reboot was already made and released to critical acclaim. And who really wants someone to remake the old Star Trek films. They are already made and if you miss them, just go back and watch them. With all the bad remakes going on, I'd rather watch something different and creative rather than the film that would ultimately ruin Star Trek. J.J. Abrams just knows what makes a good movie.Why 9 out of 10? This movie is a must see, but did have some distracting flaws. For instance, the original Spock makes a ten second cameo that feels really out of place (it's not even explained) and the ending is kind of anti-climatic. These flaws aren't significant, but they do hurt because they felt like lazy decisions on part of the writing team.Either way, great movie and a must-see for anyone who is a fan of action movies, sci-fi, Star Wars, the original Star Treks (although, you must be open-minded), and the reboot.The only people who won't like it are those who know they hate these kinds of movies.

435,WheelzFourReelz,This is a very fun sci-fi movie that shouldn't be missed,9,2 March 2014,"Before I start this review, I might as well tell you the story that happened during my movie experience. I was watching the movie with one of my friends, when all of a sudden, I had to use the bathroom. I went out of the room and used the bathroom. When I walked out, I went into the theater room. What I noticed was that my friend was gone and there was a couple sitting in the seats we were sitting in. I also noticed that it was the end of the movie. I was so disappointed! So I walked out of the room and I saw, at the other end of the hall, the sign showcasing ""Star Trek Into Darkness"". I walked into the wrong theater! So I walked back in, sat next to my friend, and watched the movie. So, I saw the ending of this movie twice. Not that it's really a bad thing. Now that we got that out of the way, Star Trek Into Darkness review. In this movie, Kirk made a mistake of showing his hi-tech fancy doohickeys to a primitive planet while trying to save Spock's life, getting him demoted to a pilot status. During this time, a man named Khan is doing bad things on the Vulcan planet Kronos. Kirk is sent there to stop him. Okay, now onto the review. The story is great. It's intense and kind of dark. You can really connect with the characters. I really like how all the main characters are likable, with great acting to match. At a few points, during the movie, I was having a conversation with myself about this; ""Was this the best casting choice for Kirk?"" Yes. He may seem awkward at times, but he is awesome. This movie is intense! There's lots of gun battles, chase scenes, ship battles, fist fights, and even one character crunching another character's skull in (I can still hear that sound). They are really cool and always keep you on edge. This is a sci-fi movie, so you know it's going to have special effects. These are good. They've got color, they've got detail. Excellent. The only real complaint I have with this movie is the occasional dorky film direction and line. There aren't very many, but they are noticeable, especially early on. Speaking of which, the first few minutes of the movie weren't all that special. Yes, it's intense, and yes, it forms the central plot, but I feel it could've been done better. It seems like it started off too fast. Overall, this movie is excellent. The cheesy moments and too fast beginning are definitely overshadowed by the great acting, thrilling story, likable characters, intense action, and sweet CGI. I think this is better than the first, and the original was amazing. The movie was so good, it was shocking.",Star Trek Into Darkness

This latest Star Trek was perfection. I am totally shocked at how emotionally powerful, electric and awe inspiring, visually stunning, masterfully written, perfectly paced, well conceived, drawn-up and thought out from start to the last closing credit with the finest Star Trek music score to date.Easily outdoes all other Trek movies and perhaps most of them combined with great respect to each Star Trek title from the past because this movie redefines every aspect and boundary of what anyone may or might expect from a movie or entertainment of any kind.For these reasons, and because I would never spoil anyone's chance to see this first time, and have the same thrill ride I just and seen in a good mood, in 3D, on a wonderful day with a popcorn and pop, no details herein of the movie.I'll end by making the BOLD statement that this movie will be the first ever movie to SWEEP any and all movie awards nights including Oscars. Yes, I predict a first ever Oscar sweep in any category that applies and only categories such as ""short film"" or best ""foreign film"" would not apply cause it's not on those categories. This movie should win everything.

On the whole, though, even lines like ""I will walk over your cold corpses"" make perfect sense when you hear the context of what the character is saying.

441,DavidTL,Star Trekking into Darkness,8,11 May 2013,"Star Trek Into Darkness starts off with what could be a really exciting pre-credits (or film logo in this case) mini-adventure, but in the end isn't as exciting and emotional as 2009's opening scenes, but what it does though, is re-introduces you to the characters that you love.noel Clarke (who appeared in Doctor Who and wrote and starred in Kidulthood) appears in the next scene as a man with a dying daughter, but when John Harrison (Benedict Cumberbatch) appears and tells him he can save his daughter, the father can't say no, but has to help Harrison first in a terrorist plot. This then leads into Starfleet starting a man-hunt to find him, and once his past is revealed the film gets a lot more interesting and as fast-paced as the previous film.The film features references and homages, which in a way are obvious and at times feel forced, to scenes and situations from the classic series and films. There may even be so many, that new-comer fans to the Star Trek universe since the last film may not even get any of them, but fans of the series before the JJ Abrams awesome reboot/prequel/sequel may find the references tedious, forced and even cringe-worthy. I myself had a split second moments when I was like ""really?"", but over-all in the emotion of the movie, I forgave them and loved it.It isn't as good or as fast-paced as the 2009 film, and after taking a little while to get into it, you do start to love it and it is a huge welcome sequel. Other things I liked, which in most if not all sequels are over-looked are minor characters that appear in the background of the first film are never seen again, but in this film the minor characters in the last film re-appear. Such as the little pixie goblin alien dwarf thing Scotty is friends with, also minor crew members on the Enterprise. Little cameos of minor characters for the geeks to be like ""hey its that guy!"". Abrams has tons of attention to detail, and I actually wish he didn't have to do Star Wars Episode VII in 2015, because Paramount plan to make and release the next Star Trek film in 2016, on the franchises 50th anniversary. Abrams could direct it still, but would literally have to move from Star Wars to Star Trek, and I don't think he'll be doing that. I just hope the next director they choose will carry on with Abram's style, even the lens flares!""Star Trek Into Darkness"" never goes into darkness, but does have fast-paced action scenes, amazing special effects and sets and great music. It's a welcome sequel to the previous film, but for original fans, the frequent references and homages to the previous TV-series and movies may be too much and distract them, and will either love them or hate them.",Star Trek Into Darkness
442,groovyuniverse,A little compressed but highly enjoyable overall.,7,14 July 2013,"This review starts with a confession: I never really loved TOS. As a now 28-year old I instead used to watch TNG, DS9 and Voyager in my mid-teen years. In the time I was really immersed in ST I could still feel the strong echoes of the impact of TOS, but the series seemed outdated to me when I watched it. All I occasionally saw was a vision of the future that had become prehistoric and a chubby Kirk being a silly pervert. I did watch all the Star Trek movies including the TOS ones and especially enjoyed the second and fourth ones. To sum it all up, I have grown some affinity with TOS but it pales in comparison with the newer series.Recently I watched the 2009 movie for the second time, but not after I reintroduced myself to the second and third Star Trek movies first, to get me immersed in the TOS universe again. I did not do this when I watched the 2009 movie for the first time and I was happy to notice that I liked the movie better than the first time I saw it. It's full of nods to TOS that fans will grin upon and has an engaging storyline, convincing cast and nice pace overall. My only complaint was about the villain which didn't really left a powerful impression on me.Star Trek Into Darkness succeeds like it's predecessor in similar fashion but has a much more intriguing villain. To truly appreciate him you have to watch the second Star Trek movie before you go watch this one. The plot kept me invested throughout the movie while being entertained with some nice head-butting dialogue between Kirk and Spock and an even higher pace than the 2009 movie. This high pace comes with a price though. Acknowledging that STID possesses a far different style than it's spiritual predecessor from 1982 and has all the hip traits of a modern action movie (continuous use of CG, exaggerated colours, high pace of scenes) this pace sometimes makes it feel as if the movie runs past itself sometimes. After two hours of enjoyment I still felt as if the movie was rushed somehow, as if the whole thing should have lasted longer. This feeling is in stark contrast to what I felt watching the second movie, which is far more subdued but still peaks tension-wise where it needs to. So, this sense of 'hyperactivity' is my biggest complaint regarding this movie. Smaller ones are things like a particular rushed emotional response of a certain character after what probably should be most shocking event of her life.That being said, I truly enjoyed this charming and entertaining movie. It makes me yearn for the return of a Star Trek series, but without a dull captain with a stupid beagle. Woof. STID has a cool villain, great action scenes and a Kirk-Spock emotional dynamic that feels like a worthy tribute to the older movies and hopefully a cause for continuing the TOS reboot!",Star Trek Into Darkness

It is so far off the original... which makes me fear dearly for Star Wards that J.J. has taken over.The movie is very predictable and it often made me say ""Yeah, I've seen this before in the previous Star Trek by J.J"". Same tricks same visuals, same theme..I think Khan was played very well by B. Cumberbatch. He was scary, formidable, cold... but he lacked the charm of Ricardo Montalban . I liked the fact that Spock finally let his human side show through. He chose the Vulcan side but he IS half human. I know a lot of critics didn't like that BUT this IS a re-launch, the events that led the original Spock to be cold and logical did not transpire in this universe, so why Spock Jr, NOT chose his human side?I liked the ""coming of age"" of Kirk... but I though McCoy was underutilized and a little cheesy. What the heck happened to Simon Pegg? We had trouble recognizing him!! Did he have a face lift or something?All in all I liked it... I would love to see more.

445,Rick_Terminal,boldly going forward but keeping the past in mind,9,17 May 2013,"I saw this last night in Derby and I'm sure glad I went to the cinema for this one.Remember those special effect moments from Star Wars in the 70s/80s that blew your socks off? This movie bought back some of those moments for me and as a result this film is always going to be special to me from now on. There was this sequence when the Enterprise fell through the clouds and.... Well go see for yourself.In terms of story there were plenty of references to plots past whilst keeping everything in the new styling. I can't really mention the ""The Wrath of Khan"" without breaking the no spoilers rule on this post - suffice to say it is well used in it's new modern setting (which ironically due to the new time-line happens before the original happenings in ""the Wrath of Khan"").I kind of felt sorry for the Enterprise crew whose only job appears to be getting sucked out in to space or dying horribly! In fact the Odeon cinema in Derby has dreadful tinny and overly loud sound, and that meant the constant sound of breaking bones and impacts genuinely made me wince (even if that was because my eardrums were bleeding).If there was one negative, I found the overly emotional characters a little irritating. Practically everyone ends up crying their eyes out and by the forth set of tears I was thinking ""oh come on, this isn't fat camp"". I mean this with respect to my American cousins, but they are an emotional lot sometimes.I suppose you could argue that Klingons are glossed over, and the 'big baddie ship' looks non-descript too; but none of that really matters. I found myself whispering to my wife every few minutes about the references to old Star Trek lore. Sadly, she is not geeky like me so she couldn't enjoy it on that level - but because this movie is very accessible she enjoyed nevertheless.Do yourself a favour; go and see this in a cinema. Don't wait for Blu-ray, and don't you dare think of downloading some awful cam recording. If you do you will ruin something quite special.Ignoring the foolish 'Sheldon like' purists who have gotten their knickers in a twist over some nonsense or other, this is a classic piece of entertainment and it deserves success.

The film's intro is very fast paced and easily grabs your attention with the redefining of your beloved characters, they are obviously more mature and yet still have the same charisma or trait that made you love them in the previous film such as Spock, he is more involved in the story and is also has larger part in the action scenes and it fits him properly. The special effects surprisingly exceeds the original reboot's effects due to them having numerous more enviorments to work with and capturing the smallest detail. Benedict Cumberbatch makes a truly effective villain with his character not being muddled but extremely complex, he is superior to Eric Bana's villain in presence and also acting ability, for a sci-fi action flick, it takes advantage of Benedict's range and general talent. This film is more emotionally involving because this involves an unpredictably more intense factor. The plot may seem like it's been prolonged but it is able to evenly pace itself. The action is actually very inventive with the choreography leaving you in ""aww"". This film doesn't seem like a complete copy of the previous movie, it has it's own mood that is more risky and involving. This Star Trek outing really does give justice to the franchise and will keep you at the edge of your seat with it's unexpected twists.",Star Trek Into Darkness
448,Mackiatoe,"Thrillingly, Witty and one Hell of a Ride.",8,12 May 2013,"Being a big of fan of Star Trek, and seeing what Abrams had done in the 2009 film, I had high hopes for this. I half expected it to be not as good as the first one, as most sequels tend to be.I was wrong.You can watch the trailers all you like, scan through every single picture on IMDb of it, but until you watch it you cannot prepare yourself for just how good a film this is. The film builds very well from the start, and has a very convincing and realistic (in Sci-Fi terms) storyline. Characters don't get much of an introduction, so you'll need to see the 2009 film to find out more, but this doesn't affect viewing pleasure in any way. What's more is that it thoroughly respects the world of Star Trek with plenty of things that Trekkies will pick up on. Yet, it is also a film that non-Trekkies can watch and thoroughly enjoy, just like the previous film. It doesn't diverge at any point either. But it also has some seriously good action scenes that will have you on the edge of your seat - they are some of the best I have ever seen. Some areas of the story were a tad predictable, but certainly nothing bad. It's explosive, clever and fun.Characters developed well from the star as well. Kirk remains bold & arrogant, while Spock retains his logical and clean attitude. Some characters could have had more a part in this - Chekov didn't get as much attention as I would have hoped, ans I would have liked to see more from the Klingons as well. Scotty really adds to witty side to this. While most the characters have the 'one liners', Scotty makes the film witty, but doesn't turn it into a comedy. He comes in at all the right moments to make this film a lot of fun to watch. However the real star of the show was Cumberbatch. He is a truly fantastic villain who really drives the story and provides a fantastic enemy. Visuals are very good as usual, and it would seem that the lens flare has been turned down just slightly. Whether you like them or not, it gives the film a real uniqueness. Like with the last film, everything in Into Darkness reflects the original, while having a modernised look. It respects the original series of Star Trek while bringing it up to date with modern technology.The only thing that I can really say is negative about the film (if I had to be honest) is that I found some of the action scenes too fast paced to make sense of them. The 2009 film had a similar problem, but it is far outweighed by the rest of the film.If you think you know what is going to happen from watch the trailers, forget it. This is a seriously good film that is fast paced, action packed. Abrams has achieved a fantastic balance action and story to make Into Darkness one of, if not, the best Star Trek film to date. It has something for everyone, Trekkies and non Trekkies alike. Best film of 2013? I have little doubt of that. Best Star Trek film ever? I would certainly say so. Best Sci-Fi film ever? Not quite, that place is taken by other films. But boy is it up there. Don't hesitate to see this in cinemas - you will regret it.9/10",Star Trek Into Darkness
449,rahmannoodles22,Star Trek Into Darkness - Noodles Review,9,19 December 2013,"Yup, I'm a Star Trek fan. Yes, I'm a Benedict Cumberbatch fan. How about we put those two together and see what happens? Well, this... the best movie of 2013 thus far. I loved the first movie (not the first Stark Trek: The Motion Picture) from 2009 that was sort of a reboot of the franchise but sort of not. The concept of it was that it opened a new timeline, sort of a parallel universe. This means that while everything in the original shows and movies did happen, all of the events in the new movies are also happening to the same characters in a different timeline (or parallel universe). This gives leeway for a lot of things as it gives the opportunity to the people making the film to create their own ideas for it, without altering any of the source material. Therefore, a lot of awesome stuff happens in the new movies.The first thing you gotta talk about in this movie is Benedict Cumberbatch. He is absolutely awesome in one of my favourite shows, Sherlock, and he owns in this movie. He's menacing, smart, efficient; everything we need. One of my only gripes about the first movie was the villain. He didn't suck or anything but he just wasn't totally awesome; and I understand that because that one was introducing the characters and the whole world. But they got it all right in this one because Cumberbatch = awesome. If he's in a scene, you even totally disregard anyone else in the scene because he literally steals every single scene just be being present. Overall, I think you get the point that he's intense. Kirk and Spock are awesome as well. There's a lot of really enjoyable moments concerning their relationship as shipmates. They banter back and forth, intentionally disregard each other, and yet still work together and respect one another. That's a real buddy movie right there. Then there's Scotty who's the comic relief of the movie and Simon Pegg really does him justice. However, not all of the characters are as greatly important. It's not that they're irrelevant, but they aren't as perfectly fleshed out as they could've been (or Cumberbatch is just stealing all their talent).Speaking of talent, the director, J.J. Abrams showcases his pretty well in this movie. While some people don't like his many lens flares, I feel they add more to the film's style. One thing that doesn't need style to be great in this film is the action and epic things that happen. The movie is filled with adrenaline and barely ever gives you a breather. Plus, it's filled with tons of money shots! If you don't know what that is, it's a really awesome scene in a movie (usually depicted in the trailers) that you know costs big money but it just makes your jaw drop. Example from this movie: the scene in the trailer where the U.S.S Enterprise crashes into the lake. Yup, it's there and it is awesome. While there's awesome and relentless action, the story's pretty dense too. It's compelling, heartfelt, and fun. It even has layers, which we don't really see in action movies often today; while there's the action between the good guy and the bad guy, there's drama, politics, and other events going on that really add to the movie.If you know someone who says that they don't wanna see this movie just because Star Trek is dumb or nerdy, they are clearly either stupid or a jerk. This movie and it's predecessor actually make Star Trek a cool and entertaining thing for everyone to watch and undoubtedly enjoy. There's great and exciting action, a strong and compelling story, fun moments, and Benedict Cumberbatch is absolutely awesome. Star Trek Into Darkness is one of best movies of 2013,",Star Trek Into Darkness
450,theredraylives,Soars with a stellar cast and script,10,20 May 2013,"Star Trek (2009) was a fantastic accomplishment for many reasons. Chief among these was its honoring of the Trek that was, while re-booting the franchise to liberate it from the weighty canon that preceded it. It also returned it to its roots, with the original crew of the USS Enterprise that started it all. With the freedom to now do what they pleased with the franchise, J.J. Abrams and his team have created a bold, thrilling installment with the sequel, Star Trek into Darkness.The film picks up largely where the first film left off- Kirk (Chris Pine) is now in command of the Enterprise, and is still hot-headed, reckless, and impulsive. He is grounded by his counterpoint, Mr. Spock (Zachary Quinto), who clearly respects his captain but does not agree with his disdain for the rules. Abrams does the sequel justice by not forgetting that this dynamic between these two characters is the crux of this film franchise, and they haven't lost a step. The chemistry these two actors bring to these roles is perfect and seamless- the two characters can and do disagree, but they could practically finish one another's sentences.It is because of the genius of this cast that the first film worked so well, and that carries perfectly into the sequel. Bones (Karl Urban) still has an amazing dynamic with Jim, and Urban is fantastic once again. Sulu (John Cho) and Chekov (Anton Yelchin) continue to shine in their relatively smaller roles, and Uhura (Zoe Saldana) really turns her supporting role into something stronger. Though her lover's quarrel with Spock in the middle of a mission on the Klingon home planet is drastically out of place in the film- one of its few weaknesses- she and Quinto continue to have great chemistry and their dynamic is yet another successful one.The film's only real weakness, like its predecessor, is Simon Pegg as Scotty. He is great in the role as he was in the first film, but he is played as largely comic relief again. The character lends himself to comedy and when the scenes aren't forced, they are great, but sadly too many scenes are written just for him to be funny and they interrupt the flow of the film. It is not as jarring as it was in the first film this time around, and isn't as much of a distraction, but it is still a waste at best and irritating at worse. And why was that little creature companion of his back? It's as if the film needed to force Scotty to have some kind of audience at all times so he could be absurdly cartoonish through the runtime. Please, for the sequel's sake, tone down the utter ridiculousness of Scotty in part III.Outside of the few gripes above, however, the film is beautiful and brilliant. The script- all at once about love, honor, friendship, sacrifice, and heroism- is absolutely phenomenal. Through it the characters grow- particularly Pine's Kirk, who learns about humility and what it takes to be a hero. Quinto's Spock still struggles with the human and Vulcan parts of his heritage, but learns to better communicate his feelings. He and Kirk grow to understand one another better- Kirk learns what it means to respect orders and follow them, and Spock understands what it means to be emotional and impulsive.The story is equally phenomenal here- an attack on Starfleet sends Kirk and his crew on a manhunt to the Klingon home planet, searching for John Harrison (Benedict Cumberbatch). Once the audience really gets a chance to see Harrison in action, however, it is clear that this is only a ruse, which is explained shortly thereafter in a frankly stellar nod to Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan- as long rumored, Cumberbatch reveals himself as Khan, one of the greatest villains in Trek history, and does him incredible justice. Cumberbatch frankly steals every scene he is in, but the film doesn't play as a remake of WoK at all- with the changes to the timeline, this alternate universe sees an entirely different story for Khan. Once again Abrams and the screen writing team- this time joined by 'LOST' alum and Prometheus screenwriter Damon Lindelof- have paid homage to Trek of old in a brilliant way, but forged something entirely their own. Cumberbatch's Khan is a completely different animal than was Ricardo Montalbon's, but he is every bit as cunning and dangerous.Once the reveal comes that Harrison is actually Khan, the film kicks into high gear and never looks back. Its final homage to WoK sees a Kirk desperate to protect his loved ones at any cost and at his most selfless- Pine has an amazing journey with this character in the first film and that journey continues strongly here. Contrary to criticisms from hardcore Trek fans, Abrams knows that Star Trek is, at is core, a journey to the center of the self- to the heart of humanity, and this film again succeeds not only in sending the Enterprise to different worlds and meeting alien races, but at driving to the depths of mankind to find the good within us all. His Trek, however, doesn't alienate- it invites. It doesn't lose itself within its techno-jargon and self-indulgence, it makes it accessible for all. Abrams continues to cement himself as one of the best directors working in Hollywood- can't wait to see what he'll bring to Star Wars. The only question that remains is, where will the sequel take Kirk and his crew?",Star Trek Into Darkness
451,ckolet37,Where no man has gone before...,9,19 May 2013,"I'm not a Trekkie. I never have been, and I probably never will. But when I saw Star Trek, I knew this series was something special. This is the Dark Knight of the second Star Trek series. It not only builds on the enthusiasm and care that JJ Abrams provided, but builds on the possible dramatic tension that Stark Treck brings us. Abrams has gone where no man has gone before in the Star Trek series. Chris Pine, Zachary Quinto and everyone in the first one returns, and they give fine, enthusiastic performances. Karl Urban as Bones is one of the many highlights of the film. Another one is Benedict Cumberbatch. I have to admit, I saw this twist about his character coming, this twist will definitely please Trekkies, and non fans alike. It parallels Iron Man 3's but, it has the momentum to keep the film going, which is all I can ask for. The lens flare is still there, not nearly as obnoxious as last time. Abrams is definitely trying to make this a trademark. If you want to see a good summer flick, I would really, really recommend this one.",Star Trek Into Darkness
452,MrGoog,Crash and Burn,2,20 May 2013,"******SPOILERS BELOW******When I saw the starship Vengeance crash into San Francisco, I thought, ""This is what J.J. Abrams has done to Star Trek.""Already, some of you might be sneering, ""Another bashing from someone who knows nothing about Star Trek."" I reiterate what I wrote 4 years ago about the previous movie (review #347, posted 5/9/2009): I was a Star Trek fan since The Original Series was on NBC. I have seen every episode of every TV series, including The Animated Series, and all 12 movies. I found the previous movie repulsive, but hoped that Abrams would deliver a better 2nd act. Instead, this movie was even worse.I shall begin by listing the few positives in this movie. Once again, Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto gave very good performances. Once again, ILM produced very good visual effects.End of positives. Here come the negatives, in random order.The dress uniforms were comical. They looked like parodies of Nazi German uniforms. The standard uniforms still looked like cheap knockoffs I would find in a second-rate costume shop.Once again, the Enterprise's Bridge looked like a disco. Once again, Abrams included irritating shots of glare to make the movie more ""realistic."" Once again, Engineering looked like an oil refinery. Once again, this Enterprise is a pale shadow of the original NCC-1701.Once again, we had a very loud and very forgettable soundtrack.Once again, we saw Scotty's pint-size companion, Keenser - a.k.a. Cabbageface, a.k.a. Rockface, a.k.a. the Jar Jar Binks of Star Trek.We saw Doctor Carol Marcus, but now she's British?? And a weapons specialist?? Now Chekov is not only an Engineer, but (temporarily) the ship's Chief Engineer?? Apparently, Paramount is allowing J.J. Abrams to turn the Star Trek universe upside-down and inside-out.When the Enterprise visited Nibiru, she was underwater, and Spock (and, eventually, Starfleet Command) were worried about the Nibirans seeing the ship emerge from the sea. Objection #1: Why was the ship underwater? Couldn't the mission be conducted with the Enterprise in orbit? Objection #2: Considering the water pressure on the ship's hull, why didn't we hear any creaking in the hull or see any breaches caused by the pressure? The shields weren't up because Scotty complained about the sea water corroding the hull. Objection #3: How did the ship enter the water without any Nibirans seeing her? Was the Enterprise invisible during descent? Are all the planet's humanoids in that one small village?What I did in the previous paragraph is called Thinking About What I'm Watching. This is what we should do when watching any Star Trek story. But in J.J. Abrams' version of Star Trek, we are expected to stop thinking and just watch the loud, frantic action.Now we come to Khan Noonien Singh. Abrams has transformed Khan from a Sikh Indian into a Brit. (Is Abrams obsessed with Brits?) Also, Khan's blood can resurrect the dead! So now Khan is like Robert Neville in The Omega Man (1971), or - dare I say it - Jesus Christ. (This Is The Cup Of My Blood, The Blood Of The New And Everlasting Covenant, etc.) Obviously, Starfleet Medical should extract blood samples from those 73 superhumans so that Starfleet personnel who are killed can be resurrected. (Again, we are supposed to stop thinking.)This movie had two scenes that may be disturbing - even traumatic - to some viewers: the explosion in London, and the crash of the Vengeance in San Francisco. Many people in the Boston area (after 4/15/2013), the New York City area (after 9/11/2001), and the London area (after 7/7/2005) may be appalled by this exploitation of massive tragedies. Abrams might be trying to assuage such objections by dedicating the movie to first-responders and military personnel ""after 9/11."" But this still looks like exploitation.I'm not the only veteran Star Trek fan who saw the ripoff of Star Trek II - The Wrath Of Khan and Star Trek III - The Search For Spock. The minor changes: Kirk enters the radiation-filled warp-core chamber; Spock gets to bellow, ""KHAN!!"" (which was almost comical); instead of The Genesis Effect, the resurrection agent is Khan's blood. Also, Kirk's death gives Spock another excuse to act like a brutal savage (what would Sarek say?), and Abrams an excuse to stage an absurd high-altitude fight scene.Let's debunk the basic defense of J.J. Abrams; i.e., that he saved Star Trek. He has replaced Gene Roddenberry's version with his own version. In the pre-Abrams chapters of Star Trek, we saw intelligent stories with strongly-defined characters. But Abrams has replaced that with movies loaded with loud, frantic action but thin on story and logic. Obviously, this is appealing to the only movie fans who count: teenagers, who expect every movie to resemble a 3-D video game. I saw the 2-D version (on the night of May 19), and noticed that the theater was only half-full and devoid of teenagers. Apparently, the Target Audience gathered in the 3-D theater. We can expect every future Star Trek movie to follow the Abrams Canon: virtually non-stop, loud, 3-D action, with very little intelligence.Paramount's weak excuse is, ""We still have Star Trek."" We still have Saturday Night Live, too. But both have become pale shadows of their original selves. Thanks to J.J. Abrams, I am no longer a Star Trek fan.",Star Trek Into Darkness
453,cnitinb,"A Fast, Flawed yet Fun Sci-fi Adventure of the Starship Enterprise",7,11 May 2013,"There is a line that protagonist, Captain Kirk says in this movie- ""I don't know what I am supposed to do but I know what I need to do"". Director J.J Abrams clearly felt the same while helming the sequel to the 2009 reboot hit Star Trek.There is everything in this movie that is 'needed' for it to be successful. The old crew is back, there is meaner villain and the special effects are simply astounding. The post processed 3D is surprisingly complementary to the CGI. In fact it is safe to say this is the best looking sci-fi movie ever and the fact that it is a stark trek film seems fitting. However the endearing element of 'adventure' which is intrinsic for a star trek feature seems grossly deficient. The USS enterprise crew is tasked to hunt down a terrorist named John Harrison. It initially seems like a simple retribution mission to avenge the death of innocents. However startling events unfold that threatens to wreck the space ship and the crew. There is a constant sense of peril throughout. It works for some time but then resolutions are slapped out so rapidly that by climax, you will probably know how it will end. Chris Pine as James T Kirk takes the best parts from his original character(leaving behind the cringe worthy overacting from his 60's counterpart), Scotty played by Simon peg takes up most of the screen time among the supporting cast. To his credit, he does a fine job and deserves it. Zoe Saldana is brilliant as ever, sportively playing 'Uhura', a side kick and lover to Spock. Karl Urban as the favorite interstellar surgeon Dr. McCoy(Bones) seems to be mostly paying a homage to DeForest Kelly(60's) Bones, complete with 'Dammit! I am a doctor not a torpedo specialist' line and the trademark one eyebrow raise. Alice eve(Dr. Marcus) is quite forgettable while John Cho as Sulu & Yeltin as Chekov all play their roles remarkably well.But the star of the show is Zachary Quinto as Mr.Spock. Qunito proves in his second outing that he is this generation's finest Vulcan. He balances the role perfectly by playing tribute to Nimoy's spock(60's) and bringing in his own originality in a perfect mix. Cumberbatch as the villain(by now everyone knows which role he actually plays!) initially seems miscast considering the race , accent etc. but all that can be forgotten when he says ""I will walk on your cold corpses"" in an eerie sociopathic tone.(Reminds one of Alan Rickman's villainous roles).This is a non-Trekkie review. I have seen a couple of the original episodes and some movies and don't care if a Klingon pronunciation is wrong. But I am a sci-fi junkie and thoroughly enjoyed the movie. Spock would probably comment 'This film is going to be a blockbuster, logically'. But we humans would enjoy it a little more if the emotional scenes weren't so forced and there was a bit more of the 'going boldly where no man has gone before' parts.",Star Trek Into Darkness
454,barryweir,Star Trek is dead.,1,31 March 2014,"""Space, The Final Frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. It's continuing mission to explore strange new worlds. To seek out new life and new civilisations. To boldly go where no man has gone before"".The Star Trek motto. Abrams didn't need to watch all of Trek's back catalog to understand the basic concept. He just needed to read that. It's a shame he hasn't. Star Trek Into Darkness is completely and utterly void of any of the elements that have made Star Trek what it is. A positive hopeful future, furthered through the exploration of space and one's own humanity. In two movies we have seen only one new planet explored, and even then only for a five minute teaser. Otherwise it's been nothing but explosions, plot rehashes and fan winks.I've been a lifelong fan of the franchise. But this movie has killed it for me, so much so that I will not look forward to any new films in the future while this team is still in control. I found the whole experience deeply insulting. The writers, particularly supposed fans like Robert Orci, really should know better. In fact I don't think any of them are as big a fan as some of them claim. Gratuitous reuse of iconic villains such as Khan (a poor shadow of the wonderful Montalban original, despite Cumberbatch's best efforts)and scenes from the classic Wrath of Khan directly lifted and reused. Characters pointlessly squeezed in to remind us that the writers supposed know their Trek (Carol Marcus being the chief offender). Convenient plot contrivances that insult anyone with half a brain (Khan beaming to the Klingon homeworld). Basic physics disregarded, when the shows and classic movies went to great lengths to formulate scientific logic. Kirk a petulant child. Spock still overly emotional. McCoy relegated to a bit-part character. Ugh.This movie doesn't get why Star Trek inspired people and stood the test of time for nearly half a century. This movie doesn't understand how to explore the human condition. This movie does not explore anything, either figuratively or literally. This movie doesn't get why McCoy was an essential part of the emotion vs logic triumvirate. This movie contains no social commentary, either by allegory or otherwise. This movie does not make you feel positive about the future.This movie is not Star Trek. It is unintelligent schlock make for low brows who get their satisfaction from endless action and violence.RIP Star Trek.",Star Trek Into Darkness
455,mtbgtown,"Cutesy, banal, script lifted from Wrath of Kahn, rescued by Benedict.",6,18 May 2014,"The movie began stumbling early, with a whiny Prime Directive catfight between Spockum (Quinto is miscast, see his adolescent ""Kahn"" yell) and TeenKirk, on the pretty red alien planet. Starting a Star Trek movie off with an absurd scenario full of unmotivated plot-necessary drama, instead of the traditional bad guys doing evil while Earth sleeps, is a risky diversion. Bombarding the audience with so much dialogue and over-explaining every thought is simply torture. The script, with absurdities like Dr. Marcus stripping down to undies to get that PG-13, or McCoy randomly, out of the blue, for no reason at all, while the ship is crashing, magically finding a ""tribble"" to inject Kahn's blood into, otherwise lifts its plot from an old classic on a dusty shelf. Star Trek II: The Wrath of Kahn is arguably the best Star Trek, so why not raid the coffers? Need a theme? No problem, we own all of Star Trek! ""Needs of the Many..."" Done. Need a redemptive self-sacrifice scene? ""Kirk kicks the warp core (downward, and somehow that moves it forward) back online and saves the ship, but kills him. Boo! Oh well. Kaaahhhhnnn!!!!"" Done and done! Need some subplots/drama? Backstories? Hand me that script up there, the dusty one.Good thing Benedict Cumberbatch can act better than a Melrose Place walk-on. He interprets at least Kahn's worldview so we have something to cling on to (see what I did there?). Maybe they brought in a special writer to doctor his role so he doesn't seem lost on the screen. Robocop also held his own as the Strike First Ask Questions Later General (read: conservative foreign policy are bad!) though his delivery was a little overwrought. Which brings us to Zachary-God-please-help-me-keep-this-role-Quinto. This guy is nothing like the real Spock. He seems like a scorned little nerd, not a logicalsuperbeing. Original Spock owned the universe and illogical beings were infesting it. (Next episode they should find a guy who can at least raise one eyebrow.) Pairing him with Ohura provides TONS of love fodder for the teenies, I get it, but dayum! Tone it down. It hogs TeenKirk away from his true personal conflicts, taken from the last movie. What is TeenKirk's problem? Why is he here? He's a rogue, renegade, loner, dangerous, can't follow orders, cliché, cliché, cliché. And as such, he must be lavished with ""You are Too Awesome"" criticisms from superadmiralfatherfigure, as if the audience doesn't know about TeenKirk. ""You're a good cop, Foley..."" and they take his ship away. Oh no!!! Will he ever get it back??? (I believe Adam Sandler wrote the script, though he's not credited.) In the end, Kahn is defeated, somehow, after a teeth-grinding tete-a-tete with Spockum that could have been so much more. Two worldviews, pure logic verses purely feral; Prime Directive verses a character that represents the worst of men. The two come together at the climax but their conversation is an opportunity lost. How about some cynicism from Kahn, a 300 year old warrior who has seen it all, and a rapier wit from Spock, who knows the dark corners of the mind and the simple, root causes of every evil, to form a word-battle of powerful brevity, each dressing down the other? It could have been Ripley in the robot loader vs the Alien. But instead, *poof* - ""I'm better than you!"" ""No you're not, cuz I am!"" 6 out of 10 for Benedict Cumberbatch and the writer who came in to doctor his role so he didn't seem like a Melrose Place walk-on.Caveat: I am a big fan of Star Trek (2009) and wrote a stellar review of it somewhere.",Star Trek Into Darkness

It's even pretty bad compared to other movies. I've seen all old movies till date and all the series and this doesn't do them even remote justice.It was only a massively impressive visual show and nothing more.The Plot was flatter than a tennis tables surface, filled with extremely predictable actions and too many clichés to count. Extremely over acting by the cast, they try to imitate the original actors and for the first movie was amusing, cause it's wasn't that much screen time, but now... my god at some moments it was truly painful to watch. I'm also truly amazed how those people survive in space if this is their professional behavior. I reminds me for Prometheus crew, worst space explorers ever.The Klingons were complete retards being in the movies just because they should. If you wanna see an amazing visual show and tons of over the top pointless action, go and check it out.

457,Sewaat,A Sequel that surpasses it's predecessor,8,31 December 2013,"Though somewhat controversial, J.J Abrams Star Trek Reboots are masterfully well crafted and Into Darkness is certainly no exception.This film definitely brings it's name sake to the Trek Universe. It delves into darker and more intense territory than previous. The most striking thing that I noticed about this film was how seamlessly universal themes of love and sacrifice bleed out from the real world and into the fictional realm of this story. One of the very first scenes involves a dying child with her frightened parents at her side. The exchange that follows forces us to imagine ourselves in the same situation. What are the limits of your compassion? Would you do anything to save the ones you love? It's amazing to me that a simply science fiction film can ask such profound and philosophical questions such as these.The film certainly has heart but it doesn't falter in other aspects either. This is truly a beautiful film. The cinematography and colour palette's certainly please the eye. This film takes us to a few different locations and each one feels as vibrant and real as the last. The acting is superb as well. The cast from the first film all come back to reprise their respected roles, along with some great new comers too. Benedict Cumberbatch in particularly gives a powerful performance as Khan. A super-human terrorist hell bent on revenge. His brutal and icy demeanor is extremely intimidating. He is doubtlessly one of the best movie villains of the 21st century.Star Trek: Into Darkness takes every stake and risk to the next level. It's a thrilling and excellent sequel to an equally rock-solid reboot. The characters are more fleshed out and expanded upon and the threat of danger is cranked to the maximum. I really enjoyed this one and I'm sure fans of the 2009 film will too.",Star Trek Into Darkness
458,ahassan-12342,Modern politics meets sci-fi meets action thriller,7,2 August 2016,"JJ Abrams' reboot of the Star Trek film franchise attempted to bring everyone on board, providing something for long-standing fans and newbies like me alike. He continues to do this successfully in Into Darkness.Much like the TV series, the film has discussions on important philosophical ideas such as the Prime Directive and the concept of pacifism and non-intervention. The narrative of the film in particular hinges on terrorism and the Federation's response to it. However, unlike the small-screen series it conducts these discussions while entire cities explode and characters jump of out of spaceships in outer space.Into Darkness moves along at a rattling pace and the fight and chase scenes through the streets of Earth have a sense of weight to them.

460,vicarious_tool,Fun and entertaining but not exceptional,7,18 May 2013,"This is a well executed movie with an engaging plot, great effects and performances good enough to keep your (happy) eyes and attention glued to the screen for 2+hrs. There are more or less no dull moments but as a side effect the initial part of the movie didn't feel seamless. There are lots of joyrides in terms of the run-chase and action sequences but nonetheless the plot and characters still bag a modest amount of depth. There is nothing truly unique in the plot line, you might guess what is going to happen next if you've seen lots of sci-fi cum action movies, in that sense it is more a great mix of stereotypical sub-plots. Some dialogues are witty and sharp, some not so much. There is generally not much melodrama, or perhaps just the right amount of it except the repetitive doses of classical altruistic heroism.Not much in terms of new cool gizmos or weapons but the usual fare. On the whole don't expect something that will blow your imagination away but rather a rich entertainment for a couple of hours.",Star Trek Into Darkness
461,cm_anon76,The worst writing since Troll 2,5,29 September 2013,I heard bad things about this movie. But I never imagined the writing would be so bad. It's like they took an outline of a script and never did any rewrites. It's like the actors were just ad-libbing. It's like the writers were just paraphrasing the actors lines.I'm especially disappointed by this movie since I thought the first one was great. How could J.J. Abrams sign on to this movie? How could anyone approve this script? Absolute incompetence.Something else that made this movie incomprehensible was the decision to change characters that we've seen in other movies and give them British accents. This was very odd.,Star Trek Into Darkness

Abrams Delivers Again,10,10 May 2013,"**DEFINITE SPOILERS** I have to admit that I was skeptical of this movie since I hadn't heard any specific outlines (my son was way more enthusiastic in seeing it). Having said that, once again the characterisations, humour, intrigue and downright brilliant special effects were even better than the 2009 Star Trek movie. I truly enjoyed the tributes to the original Star Trek II: Wrath of Khan, leaving true Trekkie fans to believe that they were in a secret society of understanding from having seen the original. The entrance of the new, improved and extremely menacing Dreadnought Class fleet vessel, USS Vengeance escalated the suspense to a new level, to which Peter Weller's character was a perfect fit. Finally, as Khan, Benedict Cumberbatch portrayed the quintessential, purely evil villain in a performance that was masterful. There were two moments of true sadness, but I'll leave those out for everyone who hasn't seen the movie. It is definitely worth a look and it is great to see Star Trek being revived in such an excellent fashion.",Star Trek Into Darkness

But I do not like this movie, to the point that I would say that I did not enjoy watching it.The writing and pacing are both equally awful. The initial scenes were completely pointless and would have been far better spent setting up the main plot. Until practically mid-way through the film, nothing much happens, and then comes such terribly-written exposition that just brings the film grinding to a halt. There is no character development whatsoever, and Cumberbatch is wasted on the woeful script. There isn't even any time or reason to dislike the antagonist.Once again, this is a film that falls foul of the concept of thinking you do not need tell an effective narrative in order to make a film; just slap together a host of random sequences and dialogue and it'll be fine.To draw a parallel that I really didn't spend too much time thinking up, I really felt (ironically) like Spock: I failed to feel anything watching this movie - no like/dislike for characters, no investment in the plot.I'm not a fanboy.

465,streetrodfan,To boldly go where every man woman and child has been before several times,5,13 May 2013,"Star Trek has been a long continuation of new stories, new adventures, fascinating pseudo science. It was the space less traveled. It was a brilliant science fiction in the 60s ahead of its time and The Next Generation is still a classic science fiction today. Voyager too had a good run with original Trek material.Enterprise wasn't that bold, didn't really go where we haven't been before. It was sort of generic, bland.Now what we have is a TOU the original universe verses JJ's universe. Which is really just a parallel universe... not really bold. The boldest thing here is that he took a famous classic film and then just mirrored it in his ""parallel"" universe . Not really that much vision here... at least this one doesn't have so many lens flares? We have essentially the wrath of Khan in a parallel universe. What's next? The Voyage Home in a parallel universe? The spirit of star trek is dead. There is no boldly going anywhere. It's JJ boldly going into an old franchise and taking everything as his own ""vision"". That's as bold as we get here... nothing really original about this movie. It just takes a famous franchise and milks off of it. It just takes what fans originally loved and gives it a make over . Not really trekking any place new or exciting. Star Trek is just a thing now, it's not a living entity, it's a cash cow without any heart. ""What can we do that will draw in lots of people, I know let's make a alternate reality of the Wrath of Khan, next we can do The Undiscovered Country!"" It's just giving the past a face lift... there is no future here for Star Trek. Give it a few bright flashy movies without any real substance and then Star Trek will be left out in deep cold space again... buried alive.It literally has many of the same story lines and dialogs as does The Wrath of Khan. This movie should have been called The Wrath of JJ Abrams, Trek Backwards.It doesn't boldly go anywhere, it's a face paced action adventure film without any real star trekking involved. When are we going to get something, new , unique, from Star Trek again? When are we going to stop trekking backwards? The character development wasn't even a focus in this film because it was non stop action and you had no time to focus on any of the characters really...There are better science fictions that come out that are original series, films anymore. If Star Trek can't give us anything new, original then it's basically dead to me. This is more like a homage to a classic film that just happened to be screened in theaters all around the world. A very talented director no doubt, talented actors... but this movie lacks the true spirit of Star Trek and any real mystery involved.It is cringe worthy that a movie can do this well when it was already mostly written and no real insight was involved and any one who saw the original could predict 90 percent of this film and its outcome...They are laughing all the way to the bank on this one...The twists it had varying from alternate universes weren't even truly significant.It's just another movie, another movie adaptation of Star Trek. If this is all that is left for Star Trek then it might as well be dead... There is no real life breathed into the franchise. We don't need to see the same movie in a parallel universe...There's a lot of Trek fans holding onto something that isn't free to grow, expand the universe. The universe isn't expanding it's contracting... if there is another movie I pray to God that it will at least by that time won't use dialog from the original films. Maybe by the time of the 3rd movie Kirk will wear William shatner's wig on his head and will get plump for the role and they will just green screen parts of the original films into the new film.There's no real dimension here, the series isn't moving forwards, it isn't going anywhere... It's going in reverse until it halts and engines burn out again.This film, this sort of Star Trek is not a long term Star Trek, it's a fast paced action film without any real intelligent thought, imagination, creativity put into it. It's not a long term solution to the struggles the franchise was facing... there will be a few more movies then Star Trek will need another reboot or it will just die out. Or maybe a true continuation of Star Trek and what it's really about is what will occur. These movies don't do STTNG or even Voyager any real justice.The true original content JJ has added is lens flare, flashy effects, action scenes. A mixed up confusing plot, full of holes... what he has added, and his unique imprint, touch on this series and this film is not very Star Trek like and isn't very original. It's just another action adventure film and it's more Star Wars than it is Star Trek. The movie fails to have any real philosophical/ moral dilemmas and it feels more like Star Wars than it does Star Trek with its over the top action scenes.They had Prime Spock in the movie last minute just to tell the audience how bad of a guy Khan really was. Most of his character development happened off screen and referred to the Wrath of Khan.",Star Trek Into Darkness
466,Staffenburgen,This Is How A Sequel Should Be,8,26 May 2013,"It's been several years now since I saw Abrams' first attempt at Star Trek, but I remember truly enjoying it. It was smart, fast-paced, funny, visually quite pleasing, well-acted, and it even had a good story. In essence, it was everything you could ask for from a summer blockbuster. When news of a sequel first surfaced, I was worried that Abrams would lose sight of these factors, and would make a lackluster sequel to turn a hefty box-office profit, while alienating fans of the original (as so many directors have done; Exhibit A: The Hangover). However, after seeing the film, I'm very pleased to say that Abrams brings everything that made the first a critical and commercial success back for this film, and with fantastic results. Star Trek: Into Darkness opens by thrusting viewers immediately into the action. The first 20 minutes or so of the film all happen at breakneck speed, and I was initially worried that the entire film would suffer from a rushed plot. However, this worry turned out to be short-lived, as when the introductory act concludes, the film slows right down and begins telling its story. And hey, guess what? It's actually a pretty good story. The second act (if you will) of the film is all about unraveling the many mysteries and complexities of the plot. The film seamlessly glides through this act, with just enough action, some genuine humor, plenty of suspense, and a handful of truly incredible emotional scenes with the main cast. Zachary Quinto really shines here; his depiction of Spock is pitch-perfect. Chris Pine is also fantastic as Kirk; he really does an admirable job at carrying the story. The supporting cast nails their parts too, with Karl Urban as ""Bones"" shining in particular. Now, in addition to the returning cast, Benedict Cumberbatch delivers a solid performance in his role too. As an actor, Cumberbatch tends to be very... theatric. Some will say he overacts, but personally I really enjoyed him. Every scene he was in, I found that he snatched my attention and didn't let go. As the film wraps up its second act, it starts moving toward it's action-packed conclusion. This is where my attention began to waver slightly. The third and fourth acts happen very quickly, and aside from one or two slower scenes, it's an action-packed marathon of special effects to the conclusion. That's not all bad, mind you, it is very entertaining and a film like this needed to have a grand climax, I just wouldn't have minded trimming this section down a bit; it felt quite long to me. All in all, it's a great film. The story is really enjoyable, the acting is great, the special effects dazzle but don't steal the show, and it was genuinely hilarious when it wanted to be. Star Trek: Into Darkness is a perfect summer blockbuster, and is exactly how a sequel should be. RATING: 8/10",Star Trek Into Darkness

So I went in, since I had to as a dedicated trekker, shocked me. As I left the theater, my gut instinct told me I just watched one of, if not the best Star Treks of all time. Sure it lacked some of the intimacy because of all the action padding in the movie, but overall Abrams only went too far with the action a few times. However, the story woven with the alternate universe redo subplot, got to allow us the audience, with an Older Spock view of the world, unfold with a god like perspective of how things should be. Allowing us to see some things confirm solid relationships that once were again, and others be shredded as only chance events. A very clever thread woven into a very well done story arc. IMO, ignore the naysayers, and beam yourself to a big screen now.",Star Trek Into Darkness
468,Classics-Movie-Fan,Massive letdown not a film for Trekkies according to Paramount,4,12 May 2013,Where to start. This movie misses the mark on so many levels it starts off strongly before the main credits but gradually falls apart & by the last hour it collapses into a clichéd by the numbers marketing driven summer action film for the masses. According to Paramount's International Marketing head (Anthony Marcoly) its not for Trek fans this time & it shows you can see the influence on the story/action its so obvious & destroys most of what made the 2009 movie amazing. Paramount should have just left the film makers alone or the film makers should have held their line as the results are so poor in places it feels more like the behind the scenes making of footage than belonging in the movie (you will know when you see the numerous scenes which needed a lot more work). This movie succeeds in making both McCoy & Scotty slightly annoying as they are given forced dialog which sounds so artificial it takes you out of the movie along with some very unnecessary plot elements/characters taken from an earlier movie. Much has been made of the character John Harrison & the actor who plays him(Benedict Cumberbatch) but he has perhaps 20-25 mins of on-screen time & very few lines of dialog he is more of an extended cameo than a fully fleshed out character & the way the character is written is quite confusing on many levels due to the way its resolved you expected a lot more after all the hype & buildup. The target audience for this movie is NOT anyone who is bothered by massive plot confusion & or undramatic life or death on screen portrayals its purely designed as a summer action movie set in the Star Trek universe but only using small elements of that to tell the story.Anyone who is a die-hard trek fan will find some small moments entertaining but also some of it can be quite offensive. There are a few moments of off-screen/on-screen violence which are quite shocking when you consider them for a moment & a main character appears to share another's ultimate pain @ a very sensitive moment. Its hard to tell if this was intended or not but it feels wrong & could be considered by some to be highly offensive as the character appears to be doing this to further their knowledge.Of the main 7 Enterprise crew actors Scotty/Bones are major letdowns due to the writing & forced line readings. Chekov has a tiny little part. Sulu does not get much screen time. Its really a Kirk/Spock/Uhura movie they are in most of it & give strong performances but some of what they are asked to do on-screen is pretty poor compared to the 2009 epic. You cannot blame the actors here its all down to the structure of the movie & the weak dialog/plot.If you liked the 2009 movie you will find something to like here but only in very small doses this movie lacks most of what made the 2009 epic so enjoyable dropping that in the pursuit of chasing a summer popcorn audience & an increased box office take.Such a shame this was a missed opportunity Paramount need to get new behind the scenes talent for the next movie in this series as this one felt quite tired in places it even re-uses some minor elements from 2009 not in a good way though in a tired they have run out of ideas manner.The Enterprise crew are clearly suited to their roles they just need something well written to respond to as this movie suffers from the weak plot & dialog. You also have to question the director several major scenes felt very poorly directed/edited its time for new behind the scenes talent to bring something fresh to this series.,Star Trek Into Darkness
469,buggsi,"Not a true Star Trek, I'm disappointed",4,23 August 2013,"I'm a huge Star Trek fan, and I agree with many reviews here: this movie doesn't uphold the true Star Trek vision illustrated by TNG, DS9, Voyager. It's just a sci-fi movie with a dull script, nothing more. Second, what's with the lens flares!!! I've never seen a movie with so much flares. Filming the actors with strong lights in the background is NOT good. It's extremely annoying, extremely irritating, extremely distracting and blinding. JJ Abrams needs to revisit his directing skills. I give 4/10 for the CGI effects, without them it would have been a 1/10.

470,cnewf,recycled Gangnam Trek,3,2 June 2013,"I see anything Star Trek as a matter of lifelong habit, and don't mind J.J. Abrams' rich kid versions--as long as I'm not bored while watching them. But I lost interest in this one about half-way through. It is too formulaic not to be predictable, the hyperrealism of the refitted 1960s characters loses its novelty, the randomized emotional shifts become tiring, and the pile up action sequences get too relentless and implausible to be entertaining. There are moments of funny writing, and the total lack of originality is supposed to be a feature not a bug, so I often enjoyed the accents and personality quirks I remember from watching the first series as a kid. But the core group, led by the Boy Kirk, is too frat house to be very interesting, their girl sidekick less important than, say, Storm in the X-Men, and the male friendship issues repetitive and adolescent. Other reviewers have pointed out the CGI overkill, and that the somewhat desperate action sequences are coupled with a general emotional immaturity (one reviewer called it kill-cry-kill-cry). Both are true, and the result is that Abrams has come full circle not so much to the Saturday Matinée 2.0 as created by George Lucas, but to the cartoon, where implausibility and even idiocy are supposed to be part of the fun. One unintentionally hilarious sequence involves the Boy Kirk kicking some machinery until it works, and my movie date pointed out that this is a kind of metaphor for the film itself.On to the ""liberal philosophy"" that someone points out is another of the film's direct borrowingsfrom the 1960s version. The movie is wrapped around the Global War on Terror: there's a conflict between using Starfleet for military or for exploratory purposes. You can guess which side the good guys are on. But everything in the film is threat and response to threat. The positions are (1) kill first, because they are coming to kill you, or (2) kill, but only in self defense. In contrast, the 60s show was full of cultural differences, philosophical divergence, emotional incomprehension, and an interesting fact about human life, which is that in many situations that matter most, ""you're both right."" 1960s Trek focused repeatedly on a situation in which the crew *believes* they face a military threat, but discover that it's not a military threat, and in fact not a threat at all. Seeing a threat turns a complicated counter into a threat, and that deeply militaristic habit of seeing threats becomes the source of the problem. In the current film, we have two positions: GWOT is regrettable (cry) tied to GWOT is inevitable (kill). In the original show, the GWOT frame would have turned out to be a mass delusion, while this film can't really imagine that things are *not* what they appear to be. So there isn't anything really to think about while you're waiting for the overblown action to die down, and by hour 2, I wanted it to stop.",Star Trek Into Darkness
471,maneckk-414-209658,To boldly go where no one has gone before  Into Darkness with Star Trek,9,27 May 2013,"My generation grew up on Sunday morning Star Trek series created originally by Gene Roddenberry At one point of time I and all my friends thought of growing up to become Space Trekkers like Captain Kirk or Mr. Spock. Mr. Spock the lovable no-nonsense Vulcan and the Enterprise's (as the space ship is called) First Officer who needs no introduction was a role model to us and has us kids aping his actions and look. When I come to think of it this fixation with the series has not grown any less with age and even after 30 years I still admire and love the characters as much.Into Darkness takes off from the first part of the Star Trek movie, with Captain Kirk heading the USS Enterprise and a selected crew to complete a mission to protect a Class M Planet Nibiru (It's so cool when you read something like a Class M planet on screen). The starting sequence however sets the precedent for the bitter-sweet but stronger than oak friendship of Kirk and Spock. Kirk with his ""bend the rules"" attitude and Spock with his ""no-nonsense logical approach"" take us on a whirlwind space trek on a manhunt to take on a dangerous one man army. The Man on a mission to destroy the Starfleet is not seemingly what he is portrayed and the secrets that are unveiled form the basis of the plot. Star Trek is one movie where the plot needs to be as justifiable and strong as it characters because we expect them to perform superhuman feats. The plot though not as strong has been worked out brilliantly in terms of science and technology and will definitely keep you riveted to your seat. This is one movie I enjoyed in 3-D because it is fun to be exploring the final frontier as a part of the Enterprise's crew. The first part was exciting because it showed us the origin of each character and how they became a part of the Starfleet, but I believe the second part and all the consequent parts would take us on an exploration beyond our imagination and it would not be fair to compare one to another (which a lot of people are doing).The characters are the heart and soul of Star Trek and I could write a separate post on each one of them and maybe I will one day. Chris Pine as Captain James Tiberius Kirk is brilliant with his boyish charm look and rebellious attitude. An undisciplined man in the most disciplined army of explorers Chris Pine is ""made to order"" for this role and like the English would say it ""as cheeky as they come"". His friendship with Mr. Spock is legendary and despite Spock's clinical approach, Kirk always manages to teach him a thing or two about relationships as well as leadership. Chris Pine is fast becoming onto a cult figure like William Shatner the original Captain Kirk.Zachary Quinto I am sure would have been a big fan of Mr. Spock himself to have auditioned for the legend's role. The casting for Mr. Spock would have been the most difficult for the production and Zachary Quinto would have been God-send for them. He fits into the role (with his Vulcan chiseled face) of Spock effortlessly like he was born to do it and fills in the shoes of Leonard Nimoy (the original Mr. Spock) with great ease. Leonard Nimoy has been a part of both the movies playing the older Mr. Spock from future and Zachary performance is unmatchable even in scenes shared with the original. His chemistry with Kirk is the highlight of the movie their dialogs have been written well with a lot of wit giving us the lighter moments.Bones or Dr. McCoy played by Karl Urban is subtle, understated but a man who even Kirk listens too. Karl displays a personality and persona which makes him the perfect choice for Bones originally played by DeForest Kelley. Zoe Saldana as Uhura, the communications officer and Mr. Spock's love interest is attractive and intelligent in character. John Cho (the famous Harold from Harold and Kumar series) as Sulu the resourceful helm officer of the enterprise (the driver of the spaceship to put it bluntly) and sometimes the acting captain is a treat to watch. Anton Yelchin as Chekov who doubles up as the navigator and an absent minded engineer has captured the accent brilliantly and uses it to charm you throughout the movie.Simon Pegg as Scotty, the chief engineer and the funny man on the enterprise is no surprise and lights up the screen with his English accent and wit no matter how serious the situation is. Scotty comes as a savior at the worst of the time and Simon Pegg managed to pull of the sequence brilliantly with his subtle brand of humour. Benedict Cumberbatch as the one man army is both sinister and believable as Khan and the most hunted man in the Galaxy. He is as expressive as a chameleon and displays multiple personas as Khan. He is a brand of villain to watch out for both in the movie and in his future outings.The action sequences are impeccable and even though over the top, the technology used makes them s believable. Director J.J. Abrams with his penchant for directing action movies leaves no stone unturned for this one. These men and characters are taking a legacy created by Gene Roddenberry (a visionary and genius by any standards) to the next level and venturing into unchartered space  ""To boldly go where no one has gone before"".",Star Trek Into Darkness

A great start to the movie opening up the general plot line with the usual twist thrown in to make you question yourself whether you're original thoughts were right or wrong. The. Action is a constant but not ridiculously so, the scenes where the action is less the plot line keeps the film together.

473,tasev1,"Not a bad film, but...lacking.",7,18 May 2013,"caution: spoilers Shall we begin.... The movie was fun, and I was entertained. Because I know Trek, certain plot twists and characters kept me entertained. I applaud JJ for misleading us in the trailer and misleading us in Benedict's character, and that is the ONLY reason this movie still had any surprises left for us. Well, and also not copying the original story and making it different, adding to the surprise. The trailer showed plenty, but left lots of room to be shocked. I did indeed like the plot, and I appreciate the changes made in order not to copy the original.On the other side without going into lengthy ranting: plausibility factor thrown out the window, any form of logic was continuously broken, the characters were ridiculous and thrown in with the dogs, and I could go on. That's not to say there isn't a movie that doesn't do that - but in these JJ films they GLARE. What on earth were they thinking hiding a starship in an ocean and not expecting to be seen? You know there's lots of SPACE up there for a SPACE ship, right? Shuttlecraft go there too. Is Kirk stupid or something? They actually admit in this film that Kirk doesn't belong in the chair and he's not ready for it...so they get rid of Captain Pike AGAIN, and throw Kirk into command AGAIN just because he's a hero.

474,DexIMF,Technically Bigger. Emotionally Smaller.,6,10 May 2013,"JJ Abrams delivered a neatly-woven prequelboot in 2009 which admirably established already iconic characters with a new perspective and vision. What worked for that movie was that it was a refreshing take on the franchise, and maintaining the old roots.Now he returns with a sequel, and as the case is with most of the sequels, they tend to be grander and bigger than its former instalment.Star Trek Into Darkness is grander and bigger (also grittier, because we live in a post-the Dark Knight world), but unfortunately, it is mostly in relation to the action and technicality instead of emotional investment. And that's kind of ironic considering Abrams' TED Talk, where he insists on emotional depth with technical grandeur for entertainers with a giant budget. I do think he was trying for that approach as it's apparent from the amount of confrontations and conversations between characters amidst all the chaos and boom-bang! The effort is evident, but it is too lazily done.The film starts off with a promise of intriguing mystery, but the final reveal falls short of the worthiness of build-up. This also gets me back to the Abrams TED Talk where he talks about 'the mystery box'–I won't go in depth of that talk, see the video for yourself–and he's right about 'the mystery box' being in every work of his–LOST, MI:3, Cloverfield. The advantage of this idea is that you have the audience already anticipating something groundbreaking. You have practically already made a promise that it is going to be awesome. And the key here is that the promise has to be delivered. That's exactly where this films falls short. We have this compelling mysterious figure terrorizing the Star Trek Universe, but when the curtains go up, the drums don't sound as loud as they did before. It's just as predictable as it gets, in some aspects, for the better, but mostly for the worse.It helps that it has Benedict Cumberbatch being all badass and menacing– savagely terrifying. His voice is so evil cold that it sends chills down the spine. It also helps that Simon Pegg's Scott has his own shining moments. It helps that despite of its predictability, there are a few surprises in the bag. It also helps that Abrams' Lens Flare fetish is in more control than ever before. But all of this gets drowned in the disappointing bigger picture. There were a few occurrences where Michael Giacchino's weeping violin score was suggesting me to be really moved by what was going on the screen, but I just wasn't. The characters just seemed distant from me. What's ironic is that the movie's most heavily emotional moment is downright unoriginal, and is in fact lazily lifted from one of the older movies in the franchise, possibly meant as a homage. Homages, I feel, should not be an excuse for building up a story that's been told before. They also shouldn't be shoved in the story just for the sake of fan-service. There are so many references in the movie (good ones, some of them) that it is nearly a remake.I would add that the movie is visually breathtaking. I would suggest to watch it in IMAX, if possible, since some parts of the movie are shot on actual IMAX cameras, and carry images with immersing resolution. I would also suggest to tone the expectations down. It's fun, but not exactly an improvement over the first one.",Star Trek Into Darkness
475,kenobi7,Abrams knocks it out of the park yet again!!,10,17 May 2013,"Definitely the best big budget blockbuster of the year so far. Does not disappoint on any level whatsoever. While the fans may have been impatient for Abrams to get the ball rolling on this sequel ever since the release of the 2009 franchise reboot, practical reasoning makes it obvious that waiting is always better if the product is successful. In this sequel, the same emotions, feelings, and thoughts from the first Star Trek are all explored again, but on a much deeper and more aggressive level. This also goes for everything else in the movie. Much like the first movie, the acting is superb, the action is crazy but terrific, and the unexpected plot points are of course, always welcome. Some have compared this film to 'Iron Man 3', 'Skyfall', and 'The Dark Knight Rises' in its execution. They say that they are all too similar in plot, because they all feature a central male character that is known to regret his feelings and actions from the past. They all feature an enigmatic villain that defeats and/or humiliates the character on their own turf. The main character then has to make a decision whether or not to step outside their comfort zone, all at potential great cost to everyone else. While I agree that these similarities are true and very interesting, they do not discredit any of the mentioned films. Each of these films is fashioned in a different way, and gives the viewer an entirely different feeling. So I, for one, no matter what any detractors of this film may say, highly recommend this film to any Star Trek or sci-fi fan, or any movie fan in general. It is absolutely amazing.",Star Trek Into Darkness
476,Ambak,Bad reboot II,5,9 May 2013,"Well, it's not saying much but this a slight improvement on the first reboot. At least the characters develop a sliver of recognisability. The problem, of course, is that we know that the crew will not die, otherwise there couldn't have been an original series, which rather neuters the tension. All thats left is a lot of noisy CGI effects (what happened to those nice quiet phasers). The movie seems to come to a natural conclusion but then carries on for another thirty minutes of headache inducing action as if somebody suddenly realised that they hadn't used all of the CGI budget. As for the title, it's pretty meaningless but I suppose that they couldn't call it Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan II (or is that minus one)",Star Trek Into Darkness
477,jessicareid,"Very enjoyable film, even better than the first.",9,14 September 2013,I have never watched any of the previous Star Trek stuff or given it much thought. I watched the 2009 film as it was a brand new modern version and tells the story from the beginning so it didn't matter that I was new to the franchise. I really enjoyed that film and was surprised to enjoy this sequel even more.All of the characters and the basics are set out in the first film and so they are all developed further in this film. The relationship between Kirk and Spok was a really amusing aspect of the story line and Chris Pine and Zachary Qunito played these contrasting characters very well.This film has a great range of action which includes physical fighting as well as a lot of fighting the kind you would only see in a science fiction like this. The character of Khan was quite captivating and Benedict Cumberbatch was very memorable in this role. I definitely recommend this film (and the first one) to anyone whether you are already a fan of Star Trek or not. This was a science fiction full of action and funny moments too and I think people of all ages would enjoy. I hope there will be more to come.,Star Trek Into Darkness
478,bousozoku,This is a demonstration of what's wrong with Hollywood,4,17 April 2014,"The poor writing and the bad acting converge with the ridiculous lights in this epic to re-boot Star Trek.That's not to say that the original cast of the Star Trek series from the 1960s had great acting. Taking a cowboy and putting him into the Captain's chair didn't always work well. The difference was the writing.They weren't trying to use a checklist to do a TV series, as much as this movie's writers were.Rather than create a totally unrelated story and make it great, they chose to pick bits and pieces of Star Trek and other media to piece together the requirements of the checklist.It's obvious that the budget was blown on sets and special effects, not on acting and not on writing.What's memorable? Nothing else but the lighting.That said, it wasn't nearly as bad as the first re-boot, as it didn't really have anything worthwhile to recommend it.This one, as a continuance of the alternative, was less of a mess. However, there was no feeling of confrontation or any real emotion of any kind. The drama was surreal and the humor wasn't funny. This was a special effects movie with no personality. It could have been just as effective made as a 1960s-style animation.",Star Trek Into Darkness

480,xscd,An Old Star Trek Fan,9,6 September 2013,"I watched the original Star Trek TV series, starting from episode 1 of the first season, when I was a boy. I've loved Star Trek in its various incarnations ever since, including these two recent movies by J.J. Abrams, who seems to have a soft spot for the original Star Trek and pays homage to it in numerous ways in both of his Star Trek movies so far.This is a very good, very entertaining and interesting movie just on its own, and it seems to me that those who are giving it horrible (1 and 2 star) reviews might likely be Star Trek purists and perfectionists who have reduced Star Trek to a static universe that never even existed in the original TV series.For example, why don't any of these Star Trek purists complain about the portrayal of the Klingons in this latest movie and in so many Star Trek movies and series before it, because the Klingons in the original low-budget TV series looked, dressed, acted and spoke like Earth humans, for example in the famous episode ""The Trouble with Tribbles.""I think that J.J. Abrams pays a tremendous amount of respect to Gene Roddenberry's original concept and realization, while allowing his own creativity to enhance the characters and plot lines typical of the original.Good job. Great movie.",Star Trek Into Darkness
481,rumasuk,bad film,6,8 September 2013,"i never give my opinion in films that are bad but this one got so much praise that i feel is my duty to write something somewhere. the main problem is, i felt the first one didn't quite make it in the climax department and this one is even worse. The story is not bad its just not very interesting and its supposed to rely in the weight of the relations between characters, and thats how they failed, abrahms lacks personality in his characters like most big budget directors who have forgotten about real human day by day, so their conversations happen like in most Hollywood movies, they feel artificial and built. We re bashed in the face with the theme with Spock and kirk and friendship but its really not done well, its plain simple and very far away from a real friendship, consequently it ends up being kind of hilariously gay and unaware of it at some points.the characters are boring the set pieces look like set pieces built to get some human moments after the cgi transitions (but they look good) and even though its got a couple of smart moments, it really doesn't justify its own existence. Its not a bad movie its the perfect definition of a meh movie. jj abrahms is not that bright my friends, hes a poor man's Steven Spielberg, i ve seen all of his movies and they present itselves like they are full of magic and charm, and they're not, and lost sucks, it was a show built around chasing payoff, that never gave us anything important of ground breaking, they just created conditions so jumping the shark would go a little bit unnoticed.yeah thats it, star wars 7 will probably more generic than the first 6 combined, and thats saying a lot giving the first one was built around the idea of homage",Star Trek Into Darkness
482,tombiddy87,Abbram's puts on a show in his latest feature,8,4 September 2013,"Abbram's new vision of the long running Sci-Fi franchise may not please the most hardcore fans but never the less 'Star Trek Into Darkness' brings plenty of entertainment and thrilling action. The Starship Enterprise must capture a terrorist after he strikes a blow on Section 31 on Earth. They find out he is located on the planet Kronos but must take great caution to avoid starting a war with the Klingons. Kirk and Spock's friendship is strained as Spock is trying to balance his out right honesty in his duties and his loyalty towards the captain. Benedict Cumberbatch, best known for his leading role in successful BBC series 'Sherlock' steals the show with a outstanding performance as Harrison. Once more Chris Pine (Kirk) and Zachary Quinto (Spock) played great off each other, providing the comedy while giving true portrayals of their character. Alice Eve is brought in to play scientist, Dr Carole Wallace. It seems like a clear attempt to bring in a female hero but for the most part is one dimensional. The films predecessor was clearly used to set up the character but little is done to progress those characters but to Abbram's credit the rare occasions when we see developments they are done very well. Despite these flaws 'Into Darkness' is still a fantastic addition and a fun action packed film. It brings potential and promise to the third installment set for a 2016 release.",Star Trek Into Darkness
483,americanentertainmentrep,"""Star Trek: Into Darkness"" A Perfect Ride in Space",10,17 May 2013,"Since the original series in the 1960's, I have been a big fan of Star Trek. I have almost always seen the movies in previews or, like tonight, I was first in line at my ""Regular Movie House,"" The Mary Pickford in Cathedral City, CA.Armed with my 3-D glasses I was ready for Kirk, Spock, and the rest of the crew of the NCC 1701 to keep me in warp drive, and I was not disappointed. The biggest problem I have in writing this review is how to not give you any spoilers.The cast is back and, like last time, marvelous. Chris Pine is the dreamy, oversexed Captain James T. Kirk, who literally gets some alien tail in this one, and Zachary Quinto is Mr. Spock. The plot is a little transparent, but it has some twists that will make trekkies think, ""Why did they do that?"" Good trekkies will figure out why. (Hint: They are on a different timeline.)There is an evil character we have sort of met before, an old friend who uses his subspace cell phone to answer a call for help, and a scene that we have seen before, but this time the looking glass gives us a different view. There are lots of 23rd-century gadgets, phaser fights, and special photon torpedoes, as well as a sense of timing among an ensemble cast that will make you smile amid the chaos.If I have you confused, don't be. Just go and escape to the future during another ride to the land of Star Trek. You will find out why I give this one a perfect 4 out of Fordyce.Some notes: The first show was in IMAX and in 3-D. I am not a fan of either, but the 3-D was cool. I suspect this film will work on any format you watch it in. Credit Check: While the credit sequence is cool and full of classic ST music. There is no scene at the end",Star Trek Into Darkness

Well, nope, we are not that lucky! I guess they lost it somewhere because this new title fails to deliver. And why? Not because of the acting performances, not because of the special effects, not because of the lightning and sound....noooo, but because of the awful story which is the entire base of the movie along with the bad script. It's so childish and truly bad! I was expecting some twists and turns, more interesting plots, unexpected events, surprises, but all we got was nothing! predictable from the middle to the end! I gave 5 only for the effects and the acting, nothing else! I guess Star Trek fans have all the reasons to be angry, this title is stupid and meaningless!

485,vishalsmail33,Start Trek Into darkness is well worth a watch,7,15 May 2013,"First off,I will admit I am not a hard-core Trekkie.Still Start Trek is one of those mega blockbuster movies that you just don't miss.To those relatively new to this universe I strongly offer u the following advice: Before watching this movie,Watch the franchise in some form,either the previous movie or the TV Show to gain some familiarity with the world and the characters.What happened with me(and what should n't with you) was it took me a while to connect with the setting and the characters and by the time I did get into the groove the movie was almost over.Now for the review,I am still debating with myself if it was a great movie or not maybe chiefly because of the aforementioned point(definitely a good movie though).The cast does a superb job and for me could not have done more.Chris Pine as Captain Kirk is brilliant.Karl Urban as Dr.Bones,Simon Pegg as scotty and Zoe Saldana as Uhura are decent.I am a Zachary Quinto fan and I cannot imagine a better executed Spock-Stern,Rule abiding,Stoic yet endearing and innocent in a way.The one who walks away with all the glory though is Benedict Cumberbatch as theintriguing ,charismatic and manipulative Khan.The CGI is exceptional.There are two- three scenes,one where the enterprise takes off from the sea and another in the end where a ship crashes and obliterates many buildings that are awe-inspiring and will blow your mind.The plot and the dialogs are average.Do not bother about the 3-D, it is non-existent(I caught the movie in Imax).I cannot put a finger on it but the movie seems lacking in some aspects.If you are not a trekkie,the movie may not exactly be stupendous or put a smile on your face,but yea it is one of those movies that you want to be good,you want to enjoy,you hope to enjoy.I hope hardcore fans and others enjoyed it more than i did .Dont miss it,watch it and decide for yourself.",Star Trek Into Darkness

I love good Science Fiction. I love good storytelling. Action in Sci Fi is OK if it serves a good purpose.But bang crash, run for kilometres and never get puffed out, ignore the Prime Directive, freeze a volcano, get demoted, get repromoted, ooh there's a bad admiral in star fleet (Star Trek VI) blow up, smash, do the Millennium-Falcon-sideways-to-escape-the badies, die and come back to life using super-human blood (Battlestar Galactica), jump 30meters and don't brake an ankle...A great SciFi movie can get away with a few things that are beyond reality IF there's enough good story telling/acting/drama to help you make that leap. Christopher Nolan does that for me. The story of Batman makes no-sense logically, but through the carefully structured drama I can make that leap-of-faith. In this movie I can't.Khan - brilliantly played and nicely developed and the backstory cleverly brought this character into the Abrams universe.But the rest just felt like Die Hard in the 23rd Century.",Star Trek Into Darkness
487,tsakiridis1217,So let me get this straight: They actually cured Death??,5,27 March 2015,"This cannot be a serious movie. I'm not the biggest fan of Star Trek in general, so I can't say I'm devastated, but die hard fans of the franchise will probably cry when they see this. Cry and laugh.The movie starts great. The first one wasn't that bad and it had a lot of potential. One could think that this could improve on its strengths on a great length, considering the addition of Benedict Cumberbatch as the legendary ""Khan"" in the mix. So in the beginning we are sucked in with all the meetings, conventions, silent conversations and the one good thing that happened throughout: Bruce Greenwood. (Man, what an actor!) Then after the half-hour, when the explosions start... eh. When the ship goes up... eh. And even if we get some good moments now and then, and even if Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto have a good chemistry... it's when the resurrection happens that I go like ""Oh, my God"". I can't believe they approved of this. Star Trek is a whole generations' family. It has been a remarkable standout speaking for family, love, faith, wisdom and culture through its movies and series worldwide. But if they continue down this road, with the super-powered humanoids and the dark feel and the forced situations, we won't see that greatness. There could be magic somewhere in there and there could be something great to be told. But you are going to have to wait for it, because Star Trek Into Darkness may stand as a normal, typical action film, but never delivers as a true Star Trek film owes to. Star Trek stands for so much more. Hope they figure it out and deliver it before I die and can't see it.

490,stuartdonovan24,Energetic,8,27 April 2014,"A lively and pounding second outing for the Young James T Kirk(Pine) taking the original's first sequel's seminal villain Khan(Cumberbatch) into new territory. Still as an enhanced human he sets about a one man war upon star fleet for putting his superhuman crew into remission. After violating the prime directive for saving Spock(Quinto) and revealing himself to a prewarp planet, Kirk is relieved of the Enterprise. This is a brief relief as when his mentor Pike is killed in an attack by Khan he is commissioned to undertake a mission to take out Khan on Kronos with specially prepared torpedoes. Spock, however, convinces Kirk to capture rather than kill Khan as the former would be immoral without a fair trial. It also seems that Admiral Marcus'(Weller) plans for Kirk and the torpedoes have more than meets the eye. As far as casting goes, Pine, for me, is really making Kirk his own but still giving the right amount of homage to Shatner. Quinto was always perfect for the younger Spock and although I'm not a big fan of Saldana she has breathed life into the otherwise sedate character that Uhrura once was. Pegg brings a nice amount of comic performance to Scotty and with Sulu Checkov it's a good team. Cumberbatch proves to be a natural to the bad guy role and brings a nice sinister air to the role. Abrams has given the franchise an excellent new lease of life. I believe some hardcore Trekkie's are unhappy with the storyline but for me it was a really good plot, not too complicated but with just the right amount of curves to keep it fresh. The effects are well put together and the film has something of an electric pace that would make The Motion Picture look as if it as in reverse. If Abrams can do this sort of thing with Episode 7 then hopefully Star Wars is not doomed by Disney.",Star Trek Into Darkness

Sure JJ Abrams level of paranoia was kind of ridiculous and I kinda knew what would happen but none of that mattered. He steered the movie into ways that made complete character and story sense. On top of all that, it looked amazing in IMAX 3D. Many movies that go the 3D route are headachy and a mess but this was awesome. If there was one complaint I had, some of the ""science"" looked fishy. I mean I get it, it's science fiction but come on, as our society moves forward would it be so wrong to have science that isn't there to just look cool?Other than that I loved every minute of it.

At the end of that movie, all we had was a Kirk who was nothing but an unrepentant bad boy with no regard for anyone but himself and his own disrespect for the rules. That's not a leader, so putting him in the captain's chair at the end ruined that movie and made it feel ridiculous. But ""Into Darkness"" addresses that problem right away by having Kirk screw up and get pulled out of the captain's chair, and the rest of the movie covers Kirk's learning and growing process -- the things he should have done in the first movie to make him worthy to occupy the chair. Plus, this movie does a great job integrating the rebooted plot line with the pre-existing Trek universe, and the plot was just as good as the characters and the dialog.

497,elmeeksio,Outstanding second outing for the Enterprise crew,10,15 May 2013,"With 2009's Star Trek JJ Abrams managed to do what many were sceptical was possible..he made the series accessible to the masses and with a sexy young cast, thrilling action sequences and lens flare aplenty we were immediately sold once again into the Trek universe and both old fans and new highly anticipated what the sequel would bring. We are thrown straight into the action before any opening credits have rolled and instantly the film look stunning. The planet Nibiru sets the scene for the opening sequence, and a decision made by Kirk (Chris Pine) results in breaking a fundamental Starfleet rule. As a result Kirk is reprimanded and first officer Spock (Zachary Quinto) is re-assigned. Just as it looks like things couldn't get worse for Kirk, a new threat in the form of Galactic Terrorist who goes by the name of ""John Harrison"" (Cumberbatch) interrupts proceedings and before long Kirk is back leading the crew of the Enterprise in hot pursuit. Around this point we are introduced to a few new characters, Dr Carol Marcus (Alice Eve), the daughter of Starfleet head Admiral Marcus (Peter Weller) whom has instructed Kirk to take 72 suspicious looking Torpedoes along for the journey.What follows is a cat and mouse chase across the cosmos that takes us to Klingon home-world Kronos, where Kirk is once again reluctant to follow orders and risk starting a war with the Klingon Empire. Abrams, along with writers Roberto Orci, Alex Kurtzman, Damon Lindelof have created another fantastic Star Trek movie. The story is great with many nods to original trek lore, the Villain is BADASS, and it looks stunning! The movie is relentlessly exciting from the very first minute inside a volcano, to the rather poignant moments between the crew that are so well written. The Enterprise crew steal the show though, it's not often that after just one movie in a franchise you are so involved with these characters, you can feel what they feel, laugh with them, cry with them.

The ship was beautiful, the story could have been better but it ticked all the boxes and introduced a new timeline (even though I can't escape the feeling that most of it was contrived and slapped together), overall an excellent foundation for new stories. So what do they do for the sequel? Rehash a legendary story arc from the original cast.It's really been long since I've seen such a derivative and uninspired movie. The first half is unremarkable while the other half is a cringe-worthy reimagining of the best and most memorable original movie, from the villain to the climactic scene across the glass, only with characters reversed. For a team that made such a radical departure, they seem to be so firmly stuck in the original mythology that you have to wonder, what was the point of the reboot? Other than Khan for the next generations, the movie itself is entertaining, far from it. However, the characters seem to be less likable than in the first installment. Everyone says Kirk has grown, and he has, but not into the charming, self-confident and mischievous character we all know and love. He's more of a juvenile delinquent in over his head. The Spock-Uhura affair provides nothing other than a supposedly humorous moment using the lovers-fight-amidst-danger-with-neutral-observer-present trope. The supporting cast is just that, and Bones is excellent as always (I'm not objective here, I admit).Making this a bi-villained movie brings its own set of problems. Cumberbatch is menacing and convincingly dangerous, but because Weller needs his own screen time, the entire Khan mythology is cut short in order to introduce the future Marcus story arc (I'm guessing the makers will go with the Kirk-Marcus romance in upcoming movies). This leaves me feeling Khan could have done more damage than just crashing an airliner into the...no, wait, a starship into Starfleet HQ.A big thumbs down for the costume department. This is Star Trek, not Star Wars, and Starfleet is not the Imperial military. The new uniforms are not so much a problem per se, but just add to the derivative feel of the movie and the story, with the notable exception of the admirals' uniforms hearkening back to ST:TMP.Thank goodness Enterprise is starting her five-year mission. Maybe now we'll see some Star Trek and not whatever this is – a lazy rehashing and cashing in on effects and a young sexy cast on the one hand, and on the sentiment of longtime fans of the franchise on the other.

This film is a highly underrated entry in the 'Star Trek' franchise, as it ended up being the catalyst for the severe backlash towards this film expressed by Trek purists that have always affected the J.J. era Trek films. Why? Because it had 'the nerve' to re-use the classic 'Trek' baddie, Khan Noonien Singh. And it worked! Sure there are some scenes that are lifted from 'Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan' but the filmmakers do manage to spin new takes on them that are benefited by the strength of the new era 'Trek' cast. And contrary to popular belief, the film actually isn't a complete 'rehash' of 'Wrath of Khan'. I mean if the film was about Khan trying to acquire a special missile that could give life to dead planets and destroy all life on a living planet... then maybe I'd be more susceptible to pull the 'ripoff' card. But that's not the case here whatsoever. J.J.'s direction is once again superb, the cast is fantastic, and the film maintains the previous film's great action-packed pace and light-hearted tone. Trek purists say that this isn't the way to go for 'Star Trek'. But as for me, this is very much my kind of 'Star Trek'.",Star Trek Into Darkness

My wife and daughter really enjoyed it too. I came here to read some of the reviews and I have to say I was really surprised that there was so many bad ones slagging this movie! It's almost like they go in wanting to hate the movie and pick it apart! I have seen ALL the Star Trek movies and this is without a doubt is the best movie in the franchise.

502,bahpofficer,Good film--but it could have been a whole lot better.,6,27 May 2013,"I love Star Trek. Please do not take this the wrong way, but this movie could have been made a whole lot better. The story line is good-- although there are times I was left scratching my head and saying ""WTH?"" to myself. There are two villains in here. First you have Benedict Cumberbatch who does an EXCELLENT job of portraying Khan. It is hard to imagine him as Khan if you grew up watching the original series and saw ""The Wrath of Khan""...However, he does make that part his own in a sense. One thing the viewer may come away with is a strange sense of empathy for his reasoning because it does have some logic. This character is not just simply a ""madman"" hell bent on getting even with Kirk, as portrayed in previous versions. Cumberbatch actually gives Khan a high degree of intelligence, cunning and an ice cold demeanor, whereas in previous versions Khan was much more emotional. A viewer really cannot predict Khan in this one either. Other characters are used for that purpose and that is also a good thing! Then you have Peter Weller. I have seen a lot of Peter Weller's work and he is usually top notch, but I felt that as Marcus, he was over the top in some of those scenes. This is the character that should have been the ""greater villain""/""God Character"" but this is role where he came off as ""not believable"" for lack of a better description. That character was also written to be too predictable. I like being surprised and I was not surprised with that character's actions. I think the fault for this lies with J.J. Abrams. Anytime that happens, it's usually direction that is the cause of it.As usual, Chris Pine, Zachary Quinto and the actors portraying those we all grew up watching do an excellent job in this film. They are the main reasons I'll get the DVD. I was really impressed with how Scotty (Simon Pegg) actually ends up being what I call the ""God Character"" here. His character knows what is best and finds out what is really going on at times--so some of this story line is revealed through him. Writing-wise it is a good strategy to use him for that since the writing with the Marcus character left much to be desired.The other issue I had with the film is that there is some mirroring of Wrath of Khan with a bit of role reversal. One will know what I mean when they see the film so this is not a spoiler. I felt that the writers should have had a little more restraint with that tactic and more originality. Something needed to be fresh and different than what we know of as viewers in that sense, but I feel that this was a set up for a later film.While there is non-stop action and a good story going on here, I feel it could have been told without all the references to the other film. I do like how the Klingons were portrayed. They rocked! Get ready for the next sequel. Let us hope that it follows the 2009 version in terms of originality. This film does not ruin the franchise by any stretch because it is good, it is just that it could have been so much better. Maybe next time...",Star Trek Into Darkness
503,SConIrish,http://filmfanboy.com/star-trek-into-darkness/,7,9 June 2013,"This movie has a very simple driving force. How can we top what came before? Already Ironman has produced some sensational visceral action and now Star Trek shot in IMAX 3D delivers a non-stop juggernaut of wall to wall action. JJ Abrams new film is a lot of fun, an all-out assault on the senses. It fulfills the intent to do ""Star Trek like Star Wars."" But it doesn't get everything right, for all its technical wizardry Abrams seems content to present a story short on anything new to say.Abrams continues his appreciation of Spielberg with a ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" inspired opening replete with spears and angry painted natives. The film jumps directly into the action where Kirk and Bones are fleeing savages whilst Spock jumps onto an erupting Volcano. The clock is ticking as the first of many cliff-hangers is engineered. Remember this is the creative team responsible for Alias and Lost. The action then takes us to London 2259 and the Royal Children's Hospital. A child is dying. John Harrison (Cumberbatch) appears offering the hopeful words, ""I can save her"" to the child's father Harrison is clearly not all he appears to be, he's a complex character and it's difficult to know if he is a villain in the true sense of the word. Another assault inspired by a ""Godfather 3"" style action set-piece ends with Kirk on a manhunt. His admiral proclaims ""Run this bastard downtake him out."" By now it's clear this addition will not be ""exploring and observing"" more like shooting and blowing stuff up.But who dies or gets hurt in these franchise films? Audience test screenings instill the happily ever after formula. But action without consequence is arguably dull no matter how many millions you spend on it. Spoiler Alert: In one scene ""Scotty"" seemingly has his head crushed, yet moments later he seems almost unaffected by the incident. He touches his sore head a few times and moves on to save the Universe. And what's up with the bad accents? Was it an intentional decision to make Pegg and Yelchin's (Chekhov) accents so laughable? Other performer's fair better, Quinto continues to shine as the logical Spock capable of warmth when needed. Pine seems to be channeling Shatner more so this time which is teeter on the dangerous and Cumberbatch looking gym hard makes an impressive foil. Greenwood and Weller are also excellent in smaller pivotal roles. Unfortunately the women Saldana and Eve are left with little to work with. Though Eve gets to show off her hard body. This is clearly a boys own adventure. Quibbles aside Abrams tells his tale with the skill of a craftsman at the peak of his powers. His team of technicians including cinematographer Dan Mindel, production designer Scott Chambliss and visual effects expert Roger Guyett help bring his vision to life.",Star Trek Into Darkness

505,peakcrew,"Better than I hoped, but ...",7,10 May 2013,"Right - I grew up watching Trek. I saw the first episode shown on British TV in 1969, and I haven't stopped yet. I am therefore a tough nut to crack with a reboot.So, how has this got a 7/10 from me when so many others hate it? Let me tell you this - except for a couple of things, it would have been an 8/10, equalling my score for Iron Man 3 last week.There is a huge amount to like in this film. It is well paced, it neatly pays homage to two of the original films (""Wrath of Khan"" and ""Undiscovered Country""), and it develops the characters some more. I know some reviewers hear are saying that they don't have enough invested in the characters: well, the number of people wiping their eyes in last night's showing suggests otherwise.The ""new"" villain is well drawn, and brilliantly acted by Cumberbatch. He keeps the role just this side of chewing the scenery, and the only thing that will keep this from being a BAFTA-contending performance is the notorious bias awards have against science-fiction.So, what lost it a whole mark? Warning: here be spoilers!! Firstly, if you are going to mess about with canon, at least be consistent about it. Having the ""Enterprise"" go into an atmosphere I can (just!) accept on the basis that old Spock may have given technology to the Federation, and starships of Kirk's era have Structural Integrity Fields (tech from TNG). However, you can't then have people sucked out through a hull-breach: the SIF would make that impossible. Regardless of the tech, though, if you are going to change a core feature so much, at least have the decency to give an explanation! Secondly, one deus ex machina in a film is cheesy, having two grates like sand in a sandwich! Calling on old Spock for clues as to the ""future"" - welllllllll, okay. Having a super-serum that brings the dead back to life - FFS! NO!! That is a genie that can't be put back in the bottle, and is a culture-disrupting event (even allowing the impossibility of Earth tech from 300 years before, i.e. us, being able to do it, and the secret being lost - another irritation). We are now left with the same problem as Iron Man 3 - what are the implications for the recipient of the serum (is he now immortal?) and for the Federation/Star Fleet/other civilisations. However, the chances are that it is going to be forgotten and never mentioned again, unless convenient to the plot.Thirdly, just like I felt cheated by a Bond film set in Britain, I'm not excited by a ST film set on Earth. It isn't what the franchise is about. Let's hope that the next one does actually ""explore strange new worlds, ... seek out new civilisations, (and) boldly go where no-one has gone before"". This one didn't.Fourthly, having Klingons as a mere plot-device is unfair. They are a major part of the Trek universe, and should not be introduced and thrown away inside five minutes. Also, isn't the damage to Praxis that done in ""Undiscovered Country""? OK, it's your call, but I'd like future films in the franchise to be done by people who give a damn about what has gone before. The current team have given us a new universe to play with, so let folk with Star Trek in their blood take over.",Star Trek Into Darkness

Abrams just needs to back off and let someone who cares about Star Trek to take it over. It could only be worse if Michael Bay got a crack at it next! The 'plot' is so full of continuity errors that I became enraged at it's grossly insulting stupidity. The mere fact that 35 odd years after cartoon sci-fi hit the screens we are still being insulted with space craft that need to bank to turn, energy weapons that have recoil, engine noise in vacuum and now, phasers that make a 'kool' slide racking noise when you 'chamber a round' proves how little talent and imagination the producers and directors possess. I give One star for Karl Urban as Doc McCoy- he nailed it. One further star for Benedict Cumberbatch as Khan- also nailed it. The rest of the cast were bereft of believability and totally underwritten. As one, they relentlessly overacted in their roles.

Daughter had objections of not knowing why some plot aspects were important. Son in law loved it as much as we did, regardless of not knowing all the older stories. We saw this new one in an XD 3D equipped theater that made me feel I was there with the story. Well worth it. Fantastic use of technology. Our movie technology is so far ahead of real science these days, which seems to make no real leaps and bounds to get us to warp drive and transporters.Continuing to build their likability, the new actors are all perfect and getting more familiar for their roles.Although I would prefer it was done in HFR like the recent Hobbit movie, I'm not deducting any points for the lack of HFR 10/10.",Star Trek Into Darkness
508,bobsutherby,Bittersweet outing,5,7 July 2013,"Well, after all was said and done, we went to the late screening of the 2D version of Star Trek: Into Darkness.

Positives: Technically brilliant and engaging, of course, with dashes of humor and action galore. We'd expect no less these days. But then come the negatives: Benedict Cumberbatch miscast as Khan (though I enjoy his acting, I was quite enamored of Ricardo Montalban's original portrayal), and the cheap, abhorrent ""tip of the hat"" to 1982's The Wrath of Khan plot line (you know, the ""needs of the many""), in this case Abrams reverses Kirk and Spock's roles and destroys what really was a poignant, moving piece of earlier Star Trek cinema. I know this is the Trekkie in me coming out, but that scene really impacted my enjoyment of the movie, leaving a rather sour taste. I think Abrams needn't have included that scene, it was awkward and I felt almost embarrassed for it being there at all, even though I played no part in the making of the movie.Guess I'll have to surrender to my inner Trekkie and say, bad call Abrams!

509,Sage-c4,Khan u believe it?,7,26 May 2013,"As the second installment in the rebooted ""alternate reality"" Star Trek universe, this film does a passable job of introducing a few new faces for some old characters. Plot wise, it does not follow very closely on the heels of the first installment. Like the original TV series, it could just as well be viewed independently from the first, though if you happen to have grown up in an alternate reality yourself, you may not understand who the principal characters are. But this isn't much of a disadvantage, because as an alternate reality project, the film deals somewhat unexpectedly with many of the characters. Christine Chappell is mentioned but not shown - maybe int ST3? Pike does not wind up in a wheelchair. And Khan, well, he doesn't quote Herman Melville, or do his own stunts, apparently. Cumberbatch is sadly just not as convincing as a super warrior as Montalban. He is as coldly calculating as you please, but just not physical, devious, or demonic as the role demands. Mostly he seems a little lost, a guest actor who is unsure of his welcome. As far as the rest of the film, there is one tribble, which kind of misses the point of tribbles. And the silly use of Khan's super blood raises the question of how Carol Marcus will be utilized in the next film. One thing for sure the next sequel will not be titled The Search for Kirk.",Star Trek Into Darkness

However, my roommate a hard-core Trekkie, and he convinced me to give the reboot a try. I thought the first movie from JJ in 2009 was OK, but not anything great. That said, I absolutely loved this movie.The 4 highlights of the film were Admiral Pike, Captain Kirk, Spock, and Khan. The acting was great, and the it was clear that the film relied on its character interactions to carry it - and they did. The action scenes were bonuses - visually breathtaking, but not central to the plot of the film. Benedict Cumbertacht was especially good - I now can't wait to see his take on Sauron in the next Hobbit film.Congratulations JJ, you have made me a bit of Star Trek fan.

513,tandrei2001,Disappointing continuation of the well known franchise,5,13 April 2014,"I saw it yesterday on TV and must say I expected some more. It started with some bad CGI effects on that planet where Spock saves that civilization by stopping the volcano from erupting. Then it features a dreadful plot. They could probably live for another 20 movies with such simplistic plots. Some bad guy from the past, or from the future occurs and, obviously wants to destroy the federation, while Enterprise with its captain will save it. But wait a minute... haven't we seen that already? Yes, in 1982 they made ""the wrath of khan"" but the stories are not at all connected in this one. As a fan of the series I would have preferred reignition of the ""next generation"" series and character instead of the wash out Kirk and his bad English crue. So let's see what's left to see from this movie: Acting ... as I said it before, todays movies don;t need acting, you get ordinary dialogues and film action scenes (oops, you don't they either use stunts, of CGI directly). And one more thing , I would like to see just once an ugly woman in the role of the brilliant engineer/scientist. I mean all the ""admiral's daughters"" must be models? I would also like to see this directors getting away from the federation bureaucracy fixed idea. In all the movies, the federation leaders were completely stupid and annoying. Honourable mentions for Spock and Khan in acting. Also the cheap humour displayed by Scott in the tightest moments make the whole plot ridiculous and pushes the production not far from Marvel comics inspired movies. BTW fix that god*** reactor for good! I haven't seen just one movie in the series where that piece of cr** would function well, and I am tired of that pseudo-science explanations of what happened and why isn't working. Man... I have never seen one screwdriver in the whole series. All the technical issues are caused by a ""damaged plasma pipe"" which can be fixed ""from software"" using that touchscreen. That was cool 20-30 years ago, but today they should think of something else. However, the movie gets some good points by the way it resolves the conflict, in a ""biblical"" way I would say. The ""sinner"" is not killed, but saved for redemption. My advise: if are a fan and have seen other movies, don;t waste the time. If you're new to it, go for it.",Star Trek Into Darkness
514,DFClayton,Ooooooooooh Myyyyyyyyyyy,8,15 July 2013,"I heard JJ Abrams in a recent interview expressing his experience with movie trailers and how scenes are selected in a way that the actual movie is a letdown. Well, that's not the case here as JJ and crew put together a preview structure that ensured a complete and pleasant surprise. It's my opinion that just like the first ST from JJ, these current actors portray the Enterprise's characters better than the originals (with due respect of course). Chris Pine met with and studied William Shatner for the first JJ Abrams feature. However, his Kirk interpretation remains very unique and he spares us the less than enjoyable Shatnerisms. Such as . . . that . . . annoying . . . dramatic . . . pausality . . . of Shatner speak. Zachary Quinto's Spock, dealing with the complexities of love with co-worker Uhura has migrated from the first film as well. Spock has to master his emotional, human half if his relationship with Zoë Zalandra's Uhura has any hope of lasting. As a viewer I love these inside glimpses rather than just the ""talking the mission"" expositions. Zachary has an excellent ability to transform between Zen like calmness and absolute rage at warp speed without being unrealistically theatrical. Equally Simon Pegg as Scotty, Anton Yelchin as Chekov, John Cho as Sulu, and Karl Urban as Dr. McCoy show equal ownership of their characters with an ""amped up"" set of skills as compared to the TV portrayals. That is, I don't get the impression of the chain like structure orbiting the lead character as in the original 60's TV series. Rather, everyone seems to have equal or at least semi-equal footing displaying confidence and skills in their duties. To compare with the TV crew that in spite of all their education and skills were quite helpless without the captain. I never understood how the engineer ""Scotty"" in the TV series who was known to have taken part in ship design, just can't figure things out until that suggestion from Kirk. Only then would the light bulb come on with the over the top ""Aye that just may work after all."" Or, the helpless female Uhura who's quite incapable of performing the duties she mastered without the strong arms of her captain. Well, you'll see none of that nonsense with JJ's muster mister!! For this new crew has totally upstaged the originals. This movie as well as JJ's first effectively conveys that everybody is equally capable of saving the day. (Hmmm, maybe the rumors about a certain actor's scene stealing in the original series are true). These comparisons are not to disparage the original actors and their abilities. I'm sensitive to the available: technology, budget, and overall 60's attitude toward weekly episodic TV production whether sci-fi or other genre. And the original ST did have a healthy supply of veteran guest actors such as Edward G Robinson's Klingon appearance. But truly a greater depth, range, and overall performance, was never expressed by the original cast, in that original setting. I enjoyed the story as well however, I didn't feel it was quite as strong as the performances. I understand the ""wink and a nod"" to the earlier elements. The resurgence of the villain ""Khan"" although not a repeat of earlier scripts, leaves me wondering ""OMG are they running out of ideas this early in the game?"" Or, ""Is this newly rebooted franchise on a diet of old stories?"" Maybe so, but personally I'm hoping for totally new adventures. In fact this is my version of the Enterprises five-year mission statement: ""To Seek out New Stories and ideas . . . To Boldly Go Where No Producer Has Gone before"" I think this needs a little polishing but would you agree with the overall message? Otherwise, it would seem that the new ST is doomed to do an endless cycle of reboots as seen in some movies. CGI and other SFX are excellent as in the first film. However, the least accolades goes to the Enterprise which seems more prone to easy bruising in a fight. But this does add to the dramatic license as we see many forever nameless crew members sucked into space. (It is sucked or blown into space)? I like that it's scaled up from the original to about twice the volume. However, I'm not too keen on the features. The CGI artists stated their reasoning for the new design changes, I just don't agree with them. And I will admit to some bias on my part. For in late 2007, quite by accident during an Internet search, I came across the CGI artist: ""Gabriel Koerner"" who I've been a fan of ever since although totally unsuccessful in contacting him. He modeled up his own version of the starship which you can search for as: ""Gabriel Koerner Enterprise Reimagined."" The Enterprise is just as strong a character as any of the crew. And likewise, it also has to be done right. And that's exactly what Gabe did. For example, he has sharply defined counter-rotating, multi colored elements just behind transparent nacelle domes that's truly hypnotic. As compared to the plane Jane version in the movie in which one CGI staff person said ""I never liked the little light show on the front of the nacelles."" I guess it's all a matter of taste but I'll take Gabe's version any day. Gabe worked on the new Battlestar Galactica, Enterprise, and quite a few movies. However, it's a mystery to me why he wasn't hired for the 2009 or this latest ST movie. As a 3-D CAD monkey, I would love to pick his brain one of these days. But as hard as it seems to be to contact him I stand a better chance of meeting one of the actors.",Star Trek Into Darkness
515,marla-erwin,"Some good parts, three huge flaws",5,8 April 2021,"I'm a fan of the Kelvin timeline, and thought JJ Abrams' first Star Trek movie was a solid 10. What a letdown this one was.A few parts of the movie are terrific: the opening scene, with equal parts levity and thrills; the beautiful visuals of the small story in a hospital; the magnificent performance of Bruce Greenwood as Pike; Uhura giving Spock the cold shoulder and going nose-to-nose with angry Klingons. But it's ruined by three huge flaws that undo all the good:1. No originality.There is no insight, no discovery, and no moral to the story. It's just a story, and not even an original one. The villain, Khan, is a retread of a movie character based on a TV character - a copy of a copy. Kirk's and Spock's role-reversed death scene is from The Wrath of Khan, and Spock's cry of ""Khaaaaan!"" is not only another cadge from that movie but also completely out of character. M2. Benedict Cumberbatch:
Could there have been a worse choice for Khan? I don't think so. He overeacts terribly, often freezing his face into something between a gasp and a sneer that is more ridiculous than threatening. I suspect he hated the role and wanted to sabotage it - it's the only explanation.3. Gratuitous nonsense:
Was the destruction of a major city really necessary? Why is Carol Marcus in her underwear? And so many more.I still enjoy this movie, or at least parts of it. I generally watch until Khan is brought aboard the Enterprise (about 56 minutes in), then skip ahead to the admiral's arrival (1:13). When you get to the Kirk-hanging-by-one-hand scene (standard in every JJ Abrams movie), skip ahead again to about 1:53.

Fine, I sat with anticipation hoping the latest instalment would leave me as thrilled as the last one. Having watched the promos I was expecting ruin to be rained down upon the earth by a vengeful Cumberbatch with Kirk and his crew saving the world after a terrible battle. What we got instead was a clichéd mix of set pieces seen a thousand times before dressed up in some very impressive special effects. First Cumberbatch is evil incarnate, then he a good guy who saves Kirk and Co. from the Klingons - then he's on the good guy's side, no wait! It's a clever trick, then he's a baddie again. Hanging by one hand from falling platform? check, being rescued from said situation by a one handed grab, check and in fact check again. Big punch up on moving platform, check and check again. Baddies who always miss and goodies who never miss, check. This movie was one of the few where my score dropped the longer I watched. the first quarter? Hmmmm, not bad 7/10. The middle part - whoops maybe not so great - 6/10. The 3rd quarter - not really enjoying this any more - 5/10... The last quarter, with the Spock fist fight and Jim being revived - should have ended up on the editing room floor.. 4/10 I can't believe this movie scored so highly on IMDb.

The most I saw was an occasional Next Gen episode and I heard nothing but jokes and parodies of the Original Series. Only saw Wrath of Khan a week ago, so I wasn't too connected to it, but this is on scale with it by all means. This newest effort from Abrams and Company was a charming, biting sequel to a mediocre reboot. The characters were inhabited, rather than forced impressions, and the villain was scary and relatable, so much so that I felt at times I was on his side rather than the Enterprise's. Also, Brad Jones was right when he said that all the good Trek films realized that the Enterprise itself is also a character, not a prop. This was what I wanted out of Trek'09, but didn't get. And then Damon Lindelof had to stumble over his own pen and do nothing but pander and line drop for the last 15 minutes! Can this guy conclude anything? Seriously, LOST was a joke that went on 5 seasons too long and ended on an anticlimax to challenge that of The Sopranos. I understand the little nods here and there to Old Trek, that was part of the fun of this film. However, Spock's exclamation of ""KHAN!"" now rivals Revenge of the Sith's ""NNOOOOOOOO!!"" in stupidity and ridiculousness. Thanks Lindelof, you miserable, misguided clod. But enough of that bile. Overall, Into Darkness was a great stand-alone installment with brilliant effects work, not as many lens flares as beforehand, and still had the feel of an Episode of Trek, you don't need an introduction to it, just hop in, enjoy the ride and brace yourself for a disappointing third act. 4.0/5",Star Trek Into Darkness
519,ipselute,The wrath of mediocrity,1,8 June 2013,"I am really stunned by this movie, and NOT in a pleasant way. It's a mockery to the original Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan made in 1982. That was the best StarTrek movie EVER made! This movie, made in 2013, is absolutely tasteless. The actors are doing their best, but the screenplay and the basic idea of the movie is just outdated. The technology imaged in this movie is like middle ages. Everything works ""manually"", everything works on steam and ""radiation"".The Star Trek should amaze you by their miraculous technologies, unheard of and unseen of ever before. The made such a complex ship, but when things don't work out, they fix it by hammer and muscle. You always fix things by smashing it! It's just incredibly stupid! Their universal solution is the use of force. When you don't like something, you just smash something to the walls, or better yet, beat the crap out of the bad guy. It will definitely make you smarter! Congrats, J.J! You destroyed the Star Trek magic!",Star Trek Into Darkness
520,emeraldorc,Amazing!!,9,12 May 2013,"I have to say this movie was brilliant. I never expected the Star Trek franchise to be resurrected in this manner. To all the critics that say JJ Abrams is a bad director and slated the first Star Trek film (needed a little improvement), what can you say now? The film is full excitement and great performances from the get go. I saw it in 3D and I was amazed by how it was all put together.This is an attempt to inject life into a sci fi franchise that was drowned out by modern flicks and was inaccessible to people who wanted some simple sci fi action and not techy speak.Well done JJ!",Star Trek Into Darkness
521,femvamp-694-160770,Boldy Going at last,10,27 May 2013,I've heard plenty of whining about this movie so I went into it half thinking it wasn't going to be all that good. Boy was I surprised. It was an incredible action movie filled with allusions of past Trek. This might have been where the whining comes from because I know how people get. I thought the references were well done and all the character development was well placed and felt right for the plot. The story itself was beautifully told. There was not much about the latest Abrams vision of Trek that I didn't like. I am not sure if you will like it if you are not a fan of the franchise because there is a great deal of emotional impact based on the knowing of Trek lore but for those who like Trek but aren't purist you probably enjoy it. I am hoping for a third helping myself.,Star Trek Into Darkness
522,sc-700-363458,Good but just missed being perfect,9,1 June 2013,"I have been fan of the original series since they first came out; I have loved the idea behind the reboot. I have loved all the actors and actresses in the series, and in this film the production values, CGI, and prop details are superb, in fact flawless. Sit back and enjoy the ride, it's great (don't read the spoilers).Spoiler Alert. So it could have been the best film of the year, could have been the best Star Film; but it isn't. So what lets it down? Stupid stuff really, and so fixable. Basically, the script, OK so you can get away with Khan being a bit of the reservation - but the Admiral? Star Fleet finest suddenly come down with a case of mass murder, and trying to blow up Star Fleet's flag ship (before a war). So Khan on a mission to avenge his (believe to him) dead crew, would not zip off to Kronus with the job half done. Unfortunately, the script is littered with ill thought out plot devices. Pace is also an issue, my wife actually fell asleep during some of the set action pieces. Mostly the action pieces are brilliant, but there are a few too long, and the odd bit that is too hurried. I enjoyed it, my wife didn't, and that always means they have failed to engage non-fans that like action movies. But it annoys me that little things have let down all the actors, actress, camera, music, CGI set design etc. because you cannot criticize, the look, feel, and epic-ness of the Star Trek world. So next film, for God sake give a bunch of really critical Star Trek fans the plot and let them rip it to bits before you star shooting. It will be the film your really deserve to make - and we want to see.",Star Trek Into Darkness
523,ferretpossum,Star Trek: The Search for An Overly Complicated Conspiracy,5,8 September 2013,"Look, it wasn't bad. I enjoyed the first 10 minutes immensely. But hmmmm the plot. Conspiracy theorists may love it. Me, I just wondered why it was necessary to construct such a complex way to kill someone. I hope you appreciate I'm trying really hard not to be Spoiler McSpoilerson here. But honestly. If you've captured a whole bunch of people and you want them dead, there have to be easier, less-prone-to- being-noticed-and-foiled ways.Also, I missed the familial characterisation, the fondness between Kirk, Spock, Bones et al that distinguished ""old"" Trek. And I think Abrams successfully recreated it in Star Trek 2009 - but somehow doesn't manage it here. Oh sure, the film starts with us being told that Kirk and Spock are best mates and this is repeated (often). But I didn't believe it. How & when did THAT happen? And there's just not that same gently- ribbing humour between the two.Finally. Simon Pegg. Ruined Mission Impossible for me and is coming close to ruining Star Trek too. I realise a lot of people love him, but I'm getting tired of his groovy nerd thing. Spaced was on TV over 10 years ago and he's still doing the same bit. Plus, I live in Scotland and can tell you that his accent sucks.So Star Trek Reboot 2. I sort of enjoyed it for the big dumb blockbuster it was, but it was a big dumb blockbuster and nothing more, which is a pity as it was all cued up to be so much more.",Star Trek Into Darkness
524,garak99,"The Alternate time line ""Star Trek"" Universe is as Good as the original",8,18 May 2013,"I walked into the theater with a closed mind I admit that I did not care for the J.J. Abrams 2009 Star Trek so I was not expecting much more from Into Darkness. First the Negatives The supersonic Loud explosions, crashes and fights were a bit over the top to true trek fans as Star Trek has always been about substance not visual tricks although in IMAX 3D they were impressive. Now the positives A Starfleet Officer sets off a explosion at a Starfleet records facility a library in essences. In a top brass meeting following that explosion Captain Kirk raises the question ""A library why would anyone blow up a library? It's then revealed that that library was not exactly a library and that Starfleet in that facility was a top secret unofficial branch of Starfleet called Section-31. Holy s**t Section-31 only hard core Trekkies will get that one they were revealed in the Star Trek Deep Space Nine series as a sort of secret Star Fleet CIA doing things that Star Fleet could not do answering to no one but themselves with no rules. While this meeting is going on in a high office building in San Francisco it' s attacked by a single helicopter with a single assailant how could this be ? As we progress Captain Kirk is give the assignment of going to Kronos and launching a series of new photon torpedoes manufactured by Section-31. When they arrive at Kronos and do hand to hand combat with a patrol of Klingon Warriors and getting there asses kicked. Then someone arrives on the scene and singlehanded kicks the Klingon's asses he then removes his face covering and to Kirk's surprise it's the same guy that was shooting up the conference from the helicopter. As we move forward it's revealed that that superhero guy is indeed a superhero Noonien Singh Kahn. And in this alternate reality Star Trek universe still has his crew and want to be reunited with them. In reading reviews prior to seeing it I was expecting Mr. Spock and Lieutenant Uhura to jump each other's bones at every chance this did not happen and they did their relationship perfect. This a good film a very good film it's can be accepted by non Trek fans as a good action science film and there is enough Trek references to even the most hard core Trek fans. We even meet a certain female doctor friend of Captain Kirk who has a prominent role in Kirk future apparently in both realities. Go see this it is good",Star Trek Into Darkness
525,nmiodrag,Moments of brilliance drowned in a sea of pretentious pathos and downright stupidity,4,10 May 2013,"** No spoilers in first part ** I saw Star Trek Into Darkness yesterday in IMAX 3D and although it's visually stunning and has a superb cast with great chemistry it falls short in the storytelling department. This is one of those movies that leaves you with the impression that it has very little to offer aside from what it flaunts in the trailer. I am a huge fan of its 2009 predecessor, and can only conclude that adding the third writer to he mix resulted in three being a crowd. It has moments of brilliance drowned in a sea of pretentious pathos and downright stupidity. It opens strong and promises a great ride but then some 30 minutes into the movie abandons the potentially exciting and epic plot for a lame ""character development"" story.** Spoilers follow from here on ** First thing that offends that they evidently fired the science advisors or never bothered consulting them in the first place: while in the predecessor you had the mysterious red matter that is never explained and causes planets to go black hole, it works because it remains a mystery - here Spock freezes a super-volcano that is about to wipe out a civilization with a make-shift COLD FUSION device. Fusion, hot or cold, generates energy instead of absorbing it. Later on, there is this long sequence of Enterprise free falling through Earth's upper atmosphere with the saucer placed horizontally and entire ship slowly rotating, yet gravity aboard has gone completely haywire: in some parts of the ship people are flying alongside the hull, in others running along the sides of the saucer corridors, and in others still running on a gantry avoiding debris falling down. I will not even start on Kirk knocking the warp core into alignment hanging from the rafters while in free fall. Or parking a star-ship on the ocean floor for that matter.Second thing that offends is the overdone ""emotional journey"" of the characters. OK, I can buy that admiral Pike has become a surrogate father to Kirk and the obvious LOVE, care and respect they have for each-other is plausible, to the point that Kirk is emotionally shaken by admiral's sudden death. What I don't buy is that Spock - who is accused by Uhura of not showing affection - completely breaks down emotionally when he believes Kirk is dying, everything made worse by ""holding hands"" through the radiation chamber glass door.However, the worst offense is using Klingon home-world and a group of Klingons as a cheap teaser. The movie promises an imminent all-out Klingon/federation war with Khan involved in a middle of it; to abandon that storyline and Klingons altogether in a few minutes, and offer a sappy Kirk / Spock love story with Khan stuck in between.",Star Trek Into Darkness
526,TyRawrrnosaurus,A Grand Adventure that Lacks Ingenuity,7,22 May 2013,"There has been much anticipation surrounding J.J. Abrams' follow-up sequel Star Trek Into Darkness, and the mystery box has finally been opened. Star Trek Into Darkness delivers on many of the same levels its predecessor reboot had done upon its release, and it also fails in similar fashion as well. Basically, what I'm saying here is that this new Star Trek universe lacks balls, but is highly enjoyable to watch.Star Trek Into Darkness takes place in 2259, one year after the cataclysmic events Nero had caused throughout the universe. We find Captain James T. Kirk (Chris Pine), Spock (Zachary Quinto), Uhura (Zoe Saldana), Leonard ""Bones"" McCoy (Karl Urban), Chekov (Anton Yelchin), Sulu (John Cho), and Scotty (Simon Pegg) aboard the starship Enterprise on the planet Niburi to observe the natives. But this isn't your grandfather's Star Trek, J.J. Abrams demands adventure. Needless to say, Kirk is reprimanded for his actions once he returns to Starfleet.While Kirk is asked once again to man up and take responsibility for himself and the lives of his crew, a new menace threatens Starfleet. A mysterious man named John Harrison (Benedict Cumberbatch) bombs a Starfleet building in London and goes on the run. It turns out Mr. Harrison was a part of Starfleet before he went rogue. Kirk and his crew are tasked with a mission across the stars to bring Harrison to justice and face the consequences of his tyranny.As the title suggests, Star Trek Into Darkness plays with a darker plot of the reboot. There are many strong character moments that work fantastically here and in Star Trek, but at the same time much of Star Trek Into Darkness feels recycled from past movies within the franchise. The tone is pretty much the same, but the stakes seem far less aggressive than the first film. Set piece after set piece flies by with no room for our characters or plot to develop and many of the secondary characters are given very less to do.The villainous Harrison is portrayed wonderfully by Cumberbatch, far superior to Eric Bana. He is intimidating, vicious, and incredibly calculating, yet his character is given so little thought that you're never sure what his motivations are or where his intentions lie. We are also introduced to another new character, Carol Marcus who is played by Alice Eve and does a fine job, but she too is wasted and used mostly as fan service and a pretty face.What's great about the Star Trek franchise is that many of the stories told carry ambitious messages about humanity, mortality, and foreign affairs. Star Trek Into Darkness seems to say absolutely nothing. There are some heavy-handed moments in the plot that thematically touch on 9/11, but are never a big focal point in the movie. J.J. Abrams juggles too much between Kirk's duties as a captain, Spock's further curiosity in human emotion, Admiral Marcus' (Peter Weller) militaristic mindset, and Harrison's ambiguous agenda, nothing ties any of these things together.Technically, this movie is beautiful and that's what we have come to expect from any J.J. Abrams project. Star Trek Into Darkness has incredible cinematography and it works very well in post-converted 3D. It's clean and I almost think there are less lens-flares than the first film. And of course, the score by Michael Giacchino is absolutely moving and lively. I only wish that they visited more places. They only come across two planets besides Earth and we are mainly stuck on the Enterprise for the majority of the movie.Where Star Trek Into Darkness ultimately succeeds is within the cast. Everyone brings out the best in their characters, yet again, and bounce off each other impeccably well. There is a lot of amusing character interactions and fun fan service. Every action sequence is full of strong tension and built up to keep me on the edge of my seat.If you are looking for anything more than just a summer-blockbuster popcorn-flick Star Trek Into Darkness may not be for you. Most Trekkies will be up in arms against certain plot points and more specifically the recycled elements from previous Star Trek lore. The story is very uninspiring and the screenplay by Damon Lindeloff, Roberto Orci, and Alex Kurtzman is lackluster. A lot of the dialogue and character beats are reused from the first film in some fashion. The screenwriters needed to take more chances with this alternative universe they have created, which they did well in the first film.All in all, Star Trek Into Darkness is far too enjoyable as an action-packed thrill ride with amazing charismatic actors to disregard as a wasted effort. There are moments of intelligence and wit that could make any fan boy/girl squee with joy, but it never dares to be original. If only Star Trek Into Darkness expanded the mythology a bit further and chose to boldly go where no Trekkie has gone before, it could have been one of the greatest tales in Star Trek history.",Star Trek Into Darkness
527,RaspberryWaffles,Wow,9,17 May 2013,"WOW! J.J. Abrams does it again! Ten years ago who would have thought that somebody could completely revamp the Star Trek franchise? And not only revamp but REVIVE a franchise that had seemed to have long since seen its hayday. Sure, Star Trek fans were still in the millions and their passion was strong. Yet, here we are after the second installment in the new Star Trek series and it feels as though the original shine, shimmer and intrigue never left.Abrams gives us his follow up to his amazing re-imagination of Star Trek. Leaning more towards the kind of recipe that often leads to disaster in action films these days, he blew our minds with something truly new. Fans of the original Star Trek went crazy, and non-fans went crazy. Like me, I had ALWAYS been a Star Wars fan through and through. After seeing Abrams Star Trek I put away my saber and hood and adopted a phaser and Starfleet garb.It had all the right ingredients (despite what I said before about the recipe), furious action, the wild expanse and intrigue of space, a cast of actors/actresses who feel as at home in the Enterprise as Shatner and Nemoy did so many years ago. It included a villain in an insane Romulan (played the unrecognizable Eric Bana) that not only you could hate but one you could fear. It opened with one of the most powerful scenes in a film from recent memory, one that altered the normal recipe to make your viewers cry at the end, Star Trek made you cry at the beginning. You saw the relationship and development of Pine and Quinto as they embraced Kirk and Spock, fulfilling every footstep set down by their predecessors, and creating a few of their own.This presented one HUGE problem for Abrams. How could he possibly top it? Like many before him, Coppola, Nolan, Lucas, Spielberg etc, he now joins that elite group of filmmakers who can best their first attempts.Into Darkness stays true to its name, emerging you headfirst into a much darker realm of Star Trek than we have seen before. Despite the darkness, the film maintains a light mood and some good comic relief from time to time. Like Bones always says ""Dammit man I'm a doctor not a....*insert tag here*"". This is STILL funny. It also helps that Abrams starts this movie off AGAIN with another powerful scene. Not as emotional as the first films intro but this one was lighter, including lush greenery (reddery?) that is in complete contrast to the darkness of the rest of the film. Yet when the Enterprise departs and we hear the new Star Trek score an overwhelming feeling of ""OH YES! HERE WE GO AGAIN!"" cheers and swells inside of you like a child waiting for the ice cream truck.I won't give much away because surprisingly this film had a couple unexpected twists and turns. I will suffice to say that you are in for quite a treat once you go to see this film. The acting again, is superb. Another problem I felt that Abrams faced was how to make another iconic villain like Nero. Benedict Cumberbatch to the rescue anyone? By deepening his voice to a rumble usually only found in the minds of those reading The Hobbit (Cumberbatch will be voicing Smaug in the upcoming film this December) he can fill you with chills as you stare into his icy, inhuman eyes.This film surpassed all expectations. If anyone had doubted Abrams talent before, he has hushed the naysayers. Be prepared to be plunged Into Darkness....",Star Trek Into Darkness
528,mkc1218,Star Trek Into DUMBNESS,2,22 May 2013,"*** SPOILERS ***Star Trek Into DUMBNESS is action packed. Stop reading now if you loved the film because that's the nicest thing I will say. Chris Pine has pretty blue eyes. (Last chance to stop.)Roger Ebert is looking down from heaven wishing he were still alive so that he could rip Star Trek Into Dumbness to shreds. (God bless you, Roger. And while you're up there, send my sympathies to Gene Roddenberry. It's all gone to Sh--, Gene.)Star Trek Into Dumbness will gross a mountain of money because of its solid special effects and frenetic and constant action that has apparently put many viewers' brains on stun. But make no mistake, this high octane Red Bull film is flat out bad.Star Trek The Reboot ""jumps the shark"" in the very first sequence here. Spock goes into a volcano, the Enterprise is now a submarine... The only way it could have been more abominable is if Jar Jar Binks had shown up. Actually the Enterprise in the water is a symbol – this movie is a turd. A giant stinking floating turd. Very sad.(Um, note to technical folks: ""Cold Fusion"" has nothing to do with actual coldness and cannot freeze super-hot molten lava. But, of course, bad science does not a bad film make – a bad script does that.)The deftly made first film in the franchise rebirth perfectly handled the origins of multiple characters yet managed to be a rip roaring good time - a feat all in itself. It should have been downhill, smooth sailing all the way after that for gents with such talent. But me thinks now our director and screenwriters are spreading themselves a little too thin with too many gigs.The film brings back an old and beloved original series villain and in doing so serves to remind fans how good Wrath of Khan really was.Into Dumbness is a convoluted mess.The characters have completely devolved into caricatures.There are too many jokes by too many characters – a misstep which also strips the drama away with misplaced humor. (Pity our future if everyone's making jokes when big bad things start to happen.)The whole Kirk-Spock ""I am your friend"" stuff just doesn't work because the filmmakers have not built the friendship in a meaningful way between these two in the 120 minutes that precede it.There is in fact no relationship building for any of these characters (unless you consider the insufferable Spock and Uhura teen romance squabbles an example of relationship building). Plot and character have been sacrificed for action, with expository speeches in the final act used in an attempt to patch all the holes (and beg viewers for forgiveness if they were still paying attention).I still can't figure out the narrative. Something about explosions I think. Oh, the Klingons were in the film too pretty early on but they were forgotten along the way. We're at war with them now – or so we are TOLD I think. Can't really remember; I may have have gotten an early jump on my 2013 tax returns by that point in the screening.Nice to see RoboCop getting work though – even if it was a one-note role far beneath his talents.Thank the Great God of Cinema that J.J. is just directing the next Star Wars movie and that the reins of that franchise are in other hands. There still may be hope.",Star Trek Into Darkness
529,dsmgdesign,Here we go again,6,20 May 2013,"I wrote about the JJ Abram's Star Trek in 2009. This sequel is not an improvement over the first. Kirk is just as clueless, reckless and guided by what's happening at that moment. Spock is even more human in this then he was in the first. Bones, Scotty and Checkov seem to be there to provide comic relief and no more. Uhura seems to have no more professionalism than a high school teenager. What happened to my Star Trek crew that I once knew and loved? They are certainly not present in this movie. So, I've given up hope of something better.As the old saying goes. If you can't beat them. Join them.What do I mean by that? Well, if you can forgive the poor characterizations, this movie is fun, albeit in a bubble gum kind of way. It is fast-paced, full of energy, colors and life. It is the kind of fun that families could enjoy watching together. And maybe that was the point of this movie. If it was the point, then the movie was a success! I am giving this a 6, because if I'm being honest, it was a disappointment compared to the first movie. And, even though I got caught up in the fun, it really had no other redeeming qualities. So it deserves a 6.Live long and prosper.",Star Trek Into Darkness
530,DaveGu,No for me,4,17 May 2013,"Just back from seeing STID with my wife. We looked at each other afterward and basically said the same thing -- this wasn't our Star Trek. It belongs to others, not us. Others who enjoy one action scene after another with way too many impossible situations somehow made possible. There's a story in there somewhere but it plays second (or third) fiddle to other less essential elements of the film.I will say that BC plays a capable villain, and the casting in general was very good, but I was never drawn into the movie, not even for a few seconds. I knew I was in a theater with no moments of being inside the story, a feeling I get when I'm watching a high caliber film. I was drawn into the story in several other ST movies, but not this one or its predecessor.Homage was made to the ST of yesteryear, but in clumsy ways. The Tribble suddenly appeared on Bones's table. How did it get there and it was part of Kirk's cure? No thanks. Spock and Kirk trading radiation places with Spock yelling Khaaaaaannn this around seemed hokey to me. And the purpose of new Spock having a chat with old Spock was?After the movie ended I couldn't help but notice the hush in our 25% full theater. Absolutely no buzz.I did promise my daughter we'd see this movie and maybe I'll get a different vibe the second time around, but I kinda doubt it. Maybe the next one will boldly go. This one didn't.4 / 10 is all this viewer can give.Saw it again with my daughter. She liked it and because of that I liked it a bit more. My conclusion is that this new Star Trek primarily targets a younger audience and that's OK. Some of us were once a younger audience when the original ST and follow-ons were introduced. I do hope the next one deals with exploration, which was mentioned at the end.",Star Trek Into Darkness
531,dude2010,"Empty, felt like a parody on Star Trek",1,29 May 2013,"The days when Star Trek was about bold Sci-Fi ideas and originality are officially over. Con's 1. The story is empty and boring. As if someone from the real-life Idiocracy world wrote and directed the whole movie. 2. Great cast, BUT for some reason surprisingly bad acting!! Chris Pine (Kirk) was overplaying, Zachary Quinto (Spock) was OK (but, hey, anyone can play poker-faced Spock, as long as the person's face features more or less match the old Spock's face), Karl Urban (Bones) was annoying, Simon Pegg (Scotty) was unconvincing and too artificial, others - almost invisible and totally unimpressive. Benedict Cumberbatch (Khan) was an interesting addition, though, after becoming recently famous in Sherlock (TV series).3. It felt like everyone was TRYING HARD to make a parody on the old Star Trek series. 4. Movie almost randomly filled with special effects.

532,unbekannternutzer,facepalm time. they don't know much about star trek.,4,20 August 2013,"what they have turned star trek into is unfortunately a disgrace to the series. they have no idea about technology, diplomacy, war, the races or anything that made the series great. they just can do a lot of special effects, 'cool-looking' scenes, cheap lines, cliché emotional drama and fighting scenes. all of it orchestrated with the music. this is done as you would expect it if someone really focuses on that. so those aspects are not bad, there is just a lot left to desire. but if you don't mind getting only all of what i just mentioned and really nothing more then go ahead and see it. but if you want to use your brain while watching you will be disappointed. even more so if you are a fan of the series. the display of the klingons was ridiculous, they just posed as the evil-looking enemy for a fighting scene. the characters and the relationship between them feel flat and boring. the actors try to be very dramatic which makes it unbelievable for me. this combined with their cheap lines and trying to be humorous at some points make it feel forced. the story is very easy to follow, not much to process there. it has a lot of holes that are immediately visible. of course only if you are used to really concentrate on a movie on different levels.just don't expect star trek if you are going to see this movie. what you get is a space-drama combined with some aspects of star trek. calling it dumbed down would be accurate in my opinion. but i don't judge. different people want and expect different things. but what the star trek fans expect is probably not there.it's as if the movie follows a guide-book or a check-list for standard action movies.though i have to admit that i didn't really like the star trek series when mr. kirk was the lead. maybe they tried to remake that part of the series, i don't know. i just know it's not for me.",Star Trek Into Darkness
533,pool13,Mildly entertaining but hollow experience,1,8 June 2013,"I won't get big into spoilers here. This movie is not a good piece of cinematography. The emotional connections don't develop long enough to be believable, the lens-flare effects hurt in the eyes, the dialog is rusty and mostly unfunny, and that this is a bad remake of ""Wrath of Khan"" is no real spoiler.There are a lot of questions which pop into ones mind: Why is Kronos, the home world of the Klingon race and HQ of the Klingon Empire totally unprotected? There is not even ONE ship in orbit around the planet. In 2259 there is a whole fleet of D7 cruisers and bird of preys to protect the heart of the empire. The second an enemy ship warps into the system, they would have at least 50 ships on their a**** and would not survive 2 minutes in orbit.There are a lot of references to the old movie, and every one fails miserably. In the old movies, which have their own problems of course, nearly all of these moments have a purpose, started and spun along a decent time to make sense and be appropriate and even moving. But in this movie they are forced, don't mean anything, don't touch emotionally in the slightest and most of them don't even fit into the scene. They are there for fan service, thats all. Or JJ Abrams & Co are just mocking the old movies and treat the franchise with the disrespect they may think, it deserves. They already said, that they don't care for Star Trek. That explains this awful reboot.The story is short, nonsensical and the people who are in it could have been taken from some military drilling camp in the US army. They swear, they give a s*** about rules, they betray the institution they are working for etc.This is mindless cgi-cinema, shot to near to the camera, cut in pieces and shown in very short bursts of blinking pictures that give you a headache. Most of the time you can't even see what's really happening, because the snippets are to short to identify anything. The space battles are just short blinking bursts of explosions and phaser fire.To be honest, i don't care much for this movie. It was uninspired, even boring from time to time, told an unconvincing and predictable story that made little sense, as well as the plot holes which are bigger than the holes the enemy shot into the Enterprise.My recommendation: Save your 20 bucks and wait for the DVD release so you can rent it.",Star Trek Into Darkness
534,Indie_Locker,Entertaining and fun but doesn't rise above its predecessor.,7,13 July 2013,"Star Trek (J.J. Abrams, 2009) serves as a prime example of a reboot done right. With a younger cast full with both rising and established stars, Abrams et. al managed to bring Star Trek to a wider audience, encouraging both old and new fans along for the ride. It was fun and it was smart and it opened up a wide door of possibilities for this rejuvenated franchise. So now that the sequel has been released, did the momentum carry over? The answer is yes, for the most part.Star Trek Into Darkness opens up on some of our favorite Enterprise crew members running for their lives on a beautiful, exotic world. Already our attention is firmly grasped. One thing I appreciate about this series thus far is its humor is often established before or shortly after the action. It pleases to entertain and not just in the Michael Bay sense. These films have the pleasure of such rich characters and the talent of the actors who portray them that really allow the viewer to becomes lost in their world. And that's really something to admire.In this film, the Enterprise are chasing after one man named John Harrison (Benedict Cumberbatch) who is labeled a terrorist who wishes to incite war. Captain Kirk (Chris Pine) signs up to catch him after not only losing his status as Captain, but gaining it back quickly in a short period of time. He and his crew, such as Spock (Zachary Quinto), Uhura (Zoe Saldana), Sulu (John Cho), Bones (Karl Urban) and Chekhov (Anton Yelchin) team up once again for this adventure that we know will not go uncomplicated. And although he opts out of the crew early on, we all know that a film won't have somebody as pleasing as Simon Pegg and not do anything with him.The action doesn't fail to please and the film hasn't lost the series' humor, which are good things I suppose. But one thing Star Trek Into Darkess does not do is it does not attempt to me any more ambitious than its predecessor, nor does it attempt to break any new ground. It recycles a major plot line we have seen before (the villain purposefully gets caught and tries to destroy the good guys from inside) and in the end, appears a little less epic than the first film. And while it may seem comfortable for the writers to go this route, it can also go unappreciated by the viewer.Cumberbatch steals the show and commands the screen as Harrison. He transcends any sort of cliché' because he's just so badass and that's hard to deny. As unoriginal as the film is (and unfortunately that's the case) Cumberbatch still makes for a compelling villain and he brings his cards to the table. Chris Pine steps up his leading man game and delivers even better work this time around, bringing charisma and charm and effective comedic timing to James Kirk.So while the film contains a lot of good elements, such as a talented cast and a large and creative fictional universe, it fails to attempt to rise above the viewer's expectations and delivers a merely serviceable, albeit entertaining ride. Perhaps next time around the writers should raise the stakes a little bit. And not only that, they should provide their female characters with more depth and action. Alice Eve is easy on the eyes, but why include a full view of her body in her underwear for the sake of pleasing the film's male audience? The crew behind this film are smarter than that, and hopefully they learn from this.",Star Trek Into Darkness
535,BloomingtonAdam,My love / hate relationship with this movie,7,2 June 2013,"While I will attempt to avoid spoilers, I am flagging my review just in case.This is essentially the second JJ Abrams vehicle I've ever watched. I saw a few episodes of Lost, but was never a fan. On the other hand, I wholly loved the Star Trek reboot. The casting was magnificent, and the chemistry of the characters is completely intact. Having grown up with the series and the original movies, I have still managed to adjust to the alternate universe. I am a fan, and I wholly endorse the idea. Conceptually, it's wonderful to almost recreate the ""What if"" scenario from Marvel comics? What if Spock had a love interest? What if Captain Pike had lived? These ideas and more are all being explored in the new Star Trek universe.As a franchise, one of the concepts that has always made is special for me is the plausibility. Within this universe, there are races and species of all kinds. It's a given that a starship with this special crew does what it does. The science is acceptable. Some of it has even become reality! This is where my love / hate shifts slightly to hate, but not completely. More like dislike with a bitter aftertaste. I was transfixed while watching this movie. I saw women with hands to their faces during some of the action sequences, riveted to the screen. It was amazing. ****Spoilers follow*****While I was on the fence about using Khan in this way, I was good with it. The fact is, when you have seen Ricardo Montalban in this role, it's hard to adjust to a new concept, despite how good the actor is, and this one was brilliant.The movie started to lose me late in the game. At some point, instead of climbing the to the top of the mountain of action sequences, they should have known where to level off. In Star Trek II, the scene in which Spock saves the ship is wholly believable. In watching it, all one can do is just marvel at the scene. In the new movie, the saving of the ship is ratcheted up a notch as Kirk doesn't just race to fix an important component of the ship, he somehow knows where this thing is he is looking for, and manages to kick into place an object that I would assume weighs thousands of pounds and is mostly likely heavily bolted into place, even if jarred temporarily.Having gotten past this, I was settling back in when Spock beamed down to chase Khan. Again, this was a good scene to start, and then it too went way over the top. Had these scenes been in nearly any other movie, I would be fine, but they just don't belong in star trek.That having been said, the movie is still worth watching, and it's wonderful to see so much attention being given to this set of characters. I think the actors are all doing a phenomenal job, and the writing is top notch as well. Whether you are a new fan or a long time fan, you'll find much to make you happy here. Unfortunately, if you are a long time fan, there are more than a few concepts here you're just going to have to overlook. If the next movie follows this pattern, I think I'll pass and just pop in a DVD of one of the originals. In this age of special effects and fast paced action sequences, it's nice to sometimes go back to a time when special effects enhanced a movie, they didn't define it. And be prepared. If memory serves, this movie consists of a LOT of close ups, and more than a few lens flares thrown in for style. The lens flares are an interesting touch, but they work.I would have rated this movie another star or two had it not been for the two scenes I mentioned. They really hurt an otherwise wonderful movie for me.",Star Trek Into Darkness
536,S_Unit713,Sherlock stole the show,8,26 May 2013,"This is thus far the most entertaining Hollywood flick for the year 2013.I was having some excitement about the movie due 3 reasons.First due to the J.J. Abrams the director of this franchise. I was pretty sure he always has that mystery factor revolving around his plot.He certainly did not disappoint.Second is the most common reason which is love for the sci-fi thrillers.The third and the last is for Benedict Cumberbatch, which he delivers.The way he has that command over his dialogue delivery is marvelous.The rest of the member of the film also puts up some decent drama especially the chemistry between the Kirk and Spock was worth a watch.All n all this is good movie to watch and enjoy in 3D effects.",Star Trek Into Darkness

Well here we had some classic star trek good moral values, began with the enterprise saving a planet, Kirk going against the starfleet rules because he wanted to save his friend. And of course Khaaan! Benedict Cumberbatch does a splendid job portraying this intelligent and evil character, and bows to the old Khan. Into darkness has to it's funny moments, specially thanks to scotty's adventures. But Into Darkness has the same problem as so many movies today, overwhelmed with effects, yes so much that your are lost for a while from the story. And boxing fights? That doesn't simply belong to Trek, specially Spock vs Khan in ending could have been made to a classical phaser against phaser battle, or better Khan vs Spock&co. That's how a classic Trek would end.",Star Trek Into Darkness
538,RecurringNightmare,Meh.,5,19 December 2014,"I did like the original Wrath of Kahn of course, but I can also appreciate this movie on its own merits and don't care much that they changed it all.Having said that I have numerous problems with the movie.#1. The Enterprise never fires a shot, and is simply a punching bag for a bigger meaner ship throughout the movie. I suppose if you like your starships heavily damaged and passive, this is the movie for you. Most sci fi fans can tell you that the Enterprise is just as much a character as any of the people onboard. It deserved a chance to fire its weapons, to engage in battle, not just get the stuffing blasted out of it. Even the TV episodes allowed the Enterprise to fight back a little, and in Wrath of Kahn the two major ship battles were very cool indeed. Next time let the enterprise do some destroying instead of being destroyed please.#2. Kahn was overacted, with magical blood that raises creatures from the dead. I don't see why the writers keep insisting on putting in these ridiculous plot points when they are totally unnecessary.Aside from that, I just can barely remember what happened in the movie aside from a few decent scenes but its all disjointed, as if each scene were just an excuse to have the characters running flying and firing phasers.",Star Trek Into Darkness
539,tlettl83,"Don't watch it if you're not a real Star Trek fan, on second thought ?",5,13 May 2013,"Saw it in 3D with a real Star trek fan. I hated this movie, he loved it. I was surprise coming home and see so many trekkers disappointed too.I was never in too Star Trek, Inm y opinion the whole universe is so stupid and so pointless, over the top and exhausting. So I was really surprised how Star Trek (2009) took me by storm. It really came with something different and new, as well as honoring the old stuff. I was happy to see such cool effects again on the big screen, with a great story and characters very believable.Sadly, Star Trek: into darkness had none of that! It was the plain old bull from the old star trek with different faces. 10 minutes into the movie and I was getting bored and thought I was watching pirates of the Caribbean in space, regretting spending my money.The plot is overdone, too complicated to follow. The shots gave me a headache, especially in 3D, and character development leading nowhere.I cant say the acting was bad though, however the lines were poorly written. The cast did a really good job with the work given to them. Simon Pegg was great. His character got some great development, sadly we see too little of him. John Cho was also great, sadly he suffers the same faith as Simon Pegg.But acting cant save an entire film. The cast are literally loyal to the sinking ship.If you enjoyed the first movie, and otherwise don't care about Star Trek, Don't WATCH THIS!",Star Trek Into Darkness
540,ed-421,"Mostly good character, bad plot, bad science",6,25 May 2013,"Halfway into STID, the main antagonist is sitting quietly in the sick bay. He just sits timidly, doing nothing. In the original TV series, the episode Space Seed, a similar antagonist is sitting in the sick bay, while greatly weakened. The character talks charmingly with everyone that comes near, while reading all the manuals for the Enterprise. He uses RTFM as a weapon, but has already gained the loyalties of several crewmembers, just by talking. By the time he can walk around, he's ready to take over the ship with the ferocity of a lion.In Wrath of Khan, Shatner and Nimoy had a touching scene at the end, after representing Kirk and Spock for 25 years. Pine and Quinto were forced to try their own touching homage after being in one movie together. It cannot work -- we're not invested in the characters enough, and the resolution is too obvious.Spock, Scotty, Uhura, Bones -- I thought the actors here did a fine job (except for the Spock-Uhura squabble, Scotty pushing a particular button, and Spock screaming). I did not like this Kirk. Shatner's Kirk always had some intelligence and rules first, and knew when he was bending or breaking them. And he cared about his crew. Here, he acts as if he knows nothing -- just one gut feeling after another.In this movie, many unnamed characters die. No-one cares about them. In the Star Trek I know, the officers would care more. When a city suffers a major attack, the citizens still alive don't react at all. More realistically, a perpetrator fleeing a scene of massive devastation would have needed to fight thousands of enraged citizens. When Kirk grabs a scroll at the very start of the film (why?), it gets far more reaction from the local natives than does the destruction of a city at the end of the movie. What the heck is the plan of the main villains? To start a war with the poor-fighting Klingons? Revenge? Many of the set pieces are like poor quality chocolate, entertaining for the moment, but with a lousy aftertaste. No part of this movie holds up well, except for Scotty following the rules, and Kirk making a deduction early in the movie. In these two cases, they were acting like intelligent Star Fleet officers.",Star Trek Into Darkness
541,strange-6,"Soulless. Star Wars fans brace for impact, it will be hard.",5,25 May 2013,"For the record, I did like the 2009 movie, was not perfect but fun anyway and a good refresh. But now...why? Why a bunch of guys are destroying Sci-Fi most precious jewels? This guy, Damon Lindelof destroyed Alien with a really bad story and script in Prometheus. Now using all mediocrity and laziness available, he and two other writers do a complete rehash of Wrath of Khan that it feels like a shameless remake, but without brains, without mystique, without pacing. Explosions, chasing, explosions, chasing, no real sense of suspense, just go for the ride and shut your brains...I indeed felt sometimes I was watching a Bond film in space, as another reviewer suggested.It would have been so much better, if they wanted to rehash some old Trek story, to take the episode ""Where No Man has gone before"", from the 60s, and make Commander Gary Mitchell a powerful villain, like in that episode, which is so very classic and excellent Sci-Fi. I was almost convinced that this was the case, but no, Lindelof and company did not have the intelligence nor creativity, they had to bring back a story and character from the most successful Star Trek movie, just to be sure. Chickens, that's what they are, Abrams and his creative team !At first, I had no problem with the Khan character, I even liked it how he was brought back, and the film was performing decently (except for the Klingon subplot, pointless and unnecessary)...but then everything begins to fall in the third act. Khan and Kirk as sidekicks? Even though it was brief, it felt out of place, even embarrassing; then we have exactly the same story from the original Wrath of Khan with reversal of roles and change of setting, and then, a boring James Bond Spock chasing the bad guy, fighting at the top of a vehicle...boring, boring, boring.Acting is decent. Pike is good; Khan is good but the actor underused; Spock and Kirk are good, more tribute than imitation. My main problem is with the story and script and the overuse of chasing, explosion, chasing, explosion, chasing, explosion...this is not what Star Trek is about.Is this Star Trek or Star Wars?...It literally is THE END when almost the same people are now in charge of both franchises that were so different in approach and style. Star Wars fans brace for impact, it will be hard. (and again, that guy Lindelof destroyed Alien, I'm pretty sure the man is not very appreciated in the sci-fi fan community).The End is: The Alien universe, Star Trek and soon Star Wars are now part of the same by-product of the senseless, brutal and mediocre money machine, it's so shameless that it's the same people in charge. All the same movies, with different faces.How sad.",Star Trek Into Darkness
542,mattymath,It'll do.,6,19 May 2013,"I went to this with great expectations and for the most part I wasn't let down, but as I think about the next day there are some flaws here, that's for sure, and I can't get them off of my mind. The opening scene was pretty random with Kirk having stolen something for some reason. It was an excuse to take Kirk's command away and give it back to him in twenty minutes or so. All of that was too rushed. I also wonder if they can ever make another Star Trek without the Enterprise being reduced to scaffolding by the end of the movie. The darn thing used to not be able to go in the atmosphere, too. I hate the new look of beaming people. T.V.'s simple special effects were better for this one thing.First, the 3D filming was flat out bad during close ups. The scene of Kirk and Pike in the bar had every shot with huge, gray, fuzzy blobs taking up 1/3 of the screen. I didn't like the look of the 3D at all. If often distracted me from the movie. Star Trek, even as a reboot, does not need as much action as it has, in can forgo a little for some story telling. In the original series Kirk always would outwit the villain , not beat his brains out and this change just makes him seem awfully stupid in comparison with the Kirk in the original time line. Spock hopping around with Kahn on flying cars is also way to over the top.The scene with Kirk dying and Spock outside the ""radiation chamber"" that mirror images the original scene from ""Wrath of Kahn"" was too much. I was crying, literally, but only because I was remembering the original. The reboot has not done enough character development yet for me to believe that Kirk and Spock are best friends on a deep spiritual level as in the original when we had three years worth of television to base it on (and some great initial character development in the movie). The way they were going to bring Kirk back to life was too easy and obvious. My kids were saying, ""tribble juice!""All in all this went for too many explosions and fist fights and not enough character development and story telling. I wasn't going to try to weigh this against ""Wrath of Kahn,"" but frankly they made me (especially by having the Leonard Nimoy cameo). I decided I was a bad father for taking my kids to this without having them see the original Botany Bay episode and the ""Wrath of Kahn"" movie. I did enjoy the romp, but it really didn't feel much like Star Trek to me. More like a Vin Diesel movie. I suppose that this is what the world wants from the series in this day and age, but I always felt like Roddenberry's vision of the future as a place where violence was a last resort was a good one. One last thing, where the hell were the Klingons? I can't believe they just let these humans come in and kill a bunch of them and then a space battle with two wounded ships and they didn't do something.One last, last thing. How do they get from Chronos to Earth in seconds. Even at warp speeds that should take a long damn time.

There were too many convenient plot twists that were poorly tied to the original series. If you're going to try to attract the original viewers, you'd jolly well better not {SPOILERS} claim that Tribbles were a known commodity before having Trouble with the Quadratiticalie; nor should you give Khan far more strength and recuperative power than he will have twenty years hence. Your killing of Captain Pike when he, in this generation, should be paralyzed and in a wheelchair is a problem, as is Spock's uncharacteristic tear and Scotty's uncharacteristic alien assistant. Action scenes that involve hurtling through space like a missile to hit the needle in a haystack, or fights aboard multiple flying vessels, are just stupid. Hey, JJ: Star Trek has action, but it is also cerebral (City on the Edge of Tomorrow?) and is not, thank God, a Bruce Willis/Rambo exercise in the ridiculous.

What I have read here in some of the reviews those seems to be a lot more J.J. bashing than anything else.Someone has written that this movie is against the vision of the Roddenberry's Star Trek universe... where renegade Starfleet officers were not likely...To this I ask have you seen Star Trek: Insurrection... I am sure that revolved around a plot line of a renegade admiral wanting to 'displace' an entire race called The Baku.Therefore there has in the past been Darkness in the Star Trek Universe... no matter who the director...This was fast paced and actioned packed... can't wait to go and see it again!!!,Star Trek Into Darkness
545,teodoreh,Screenplay not original and somehow irritating for the older fans,7,12 July 2013,"Star Trek Into Darkness is a nice movie to watch. Additionally, teenagers that weren't even born when ""Revenge of Khan"" movie was released, won't notice anything bad about the screenplay.*Spoiler Alert* In my point of view, repeating two of the most famous StarTrek scenes in reverse mode, is irritating, sad and without a bit of originality. It's like trying to paint Mona Lisa again with a slightly different smile. You just can't do that! Producers could choose a really original script with new material, they should avoid some long boring scenes that you know how they will end anyways, and could focus on moving forward. They've chosen to go back instead - and that's not positive.So, using the same evil guy from older StarTrek movies, reversing the roles on key scenes, using same action scenes (the jump from Enterprise to the other ship) as previous movie is not a positive thing.Technically speaking, movie maintains high levels of special effects, but the whole package won't make you leave the room with a smile on your face - at least if you are a fan of the StarTrek universe..",Star Trek Into Darkness
546,SongOfFall,"A bit simplified, but still spectacular",7,18 September 2013,"Well, the special effects and the no-nonsense take on this alternative time-line James T. Kirk were good (though the explorer aspect of Enterprise's mission wasn't used in both new movies, which is sad).What I have a problem with is the introduction of Khan. While Benedict Cumberbatch showed solid and convincing acting, the idea most tied to Khan in old movies is that he was misunderstood and misjudged. While an old Trekkie like me would seek this concept and Khan's background and fate from the old trilogy in this movie, I believe, the creators of the movie didn't do him justice with the newcomers to the Star Trek universe.Not to make a spoiler here, watch the original feature film trilogy: Star Trek: The Motion Picture (1979), Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan (1982) and Star Trek III: The Search for Spock (1984), and you will be pleasantly surprised and also gain more insight with old Spock's words.Let's just not forget that Star Trek series isn't about war, it's about exploring the space and going where no-one else would dare to go.

547,SchimoCro,$185mil worth Sci-Fi bromance soap-opera made almost completely with closeups,5,24 May 2013,"Who would thought that after very good Star Trek reboot in 2009 we'll get this as it's sequel. J.J. Abrams and his writers tried to play it safe with villain that almost every Trakkie loves, they really tried to preserve the flavor of original series (although in parallel universe, where they can do anything, they decided not to write anything new), to make funny dialogues and J.J. went in extra trouble to make us remember every inch of every actor's face with so many closeups that Indian soap operas looks like Battle of the Pelennor Fields compared to this view. He tried so much to give us as little as possible. Even the special effects are way under the today's blockbusters level. For almost 200 millions dollars we expect way better visual impression than few shots of Enterprise and future London, although the beginning was very promising in that field. In other hand, beginning was promising in many fields, pretty much all of them. But at the end of the movie there was very little of upsides. Let's see the plot. At beginning we get standard fast sequel characterization primary for those who haven't see prequel. So we once again meet modern captain Kirk, who looks and acts like all-American high school quarterback who doesn't respect any rules but he is extremely moral and brave. We also meet his logical Vulcan friend and first officer, Spock, who in every appearance on screen, logically, remind us that he's logical and unemotional but he makes more illogical and emotional decisions and acts then otherwise. We also meet all those other characters who more or less serve just as humor relief what actually isn't all bad but it is a degradation of those, once interesting, characters. Not to forget, there's even one character whose only purpose is to do a lingerie scene. It's female, of course. That dynamic, interesting, funny and visually impressive beginning with a little dose of philosophy is also this movie's peak. Then we get very fast intro into movie's main plot which is spinning around an evil terrorist who makes a big mess in The Godfather style and then runs away. Guess who's going after that evil man!? Whole idea for plot is solid, but it's way from being original. Every segment in which this writers tried to be original, even in slightest possible way, ended as catastrophe with plot holes, a lot of questions (not philosophical or theoretical, just practical ones), useless characters and constant big and important battles with some new laws of physics which felt like infinity. Approximately one third of a movie went on Spock's and Kirk's bromance and those cheesy and pathetic dialogues and closeup stares between them. Another third was spent on explosions, bad visual effects and Kirk acting like an superhero (aren't all those Marvel screenings enough?). But in one third of a movie we actually saw something good. It was Benedict Cumberbatch as main villain. Although acting was in high level in general, Cumberbatch stole the show. He had help in a view of very good characterization of his character and pathetic one of good guys, so it isn't strange that big part of audience actually cheered for him. Both Chris Pine as Kirk and Zachary Quinto as Spock gave us top performance so it's fair to say that acting performance is the biggest (possibly the only) upside of latest J.J. Abram's Star Trek. Star Trek: Into Darkness ended up as an confirmation of J.J. Abrams's directing and Damon Lindelof's writing incapability. Every one of projects that two of them touched in these roles ended up as a disappointment. But the worst thing is that they have good ideas but realization of those ideas is terrible. We can only hope that they will get better in time and that new Star Wars will not end as an Indian soap opera.",Star Trek Into Darkness

Mainly because I disliked the plot of the first one leading us down an alternative time-line/universe for this reboot. So unsure that I didn't even bother going to the cinema to watch this. Watching the DVD however changed my mind as I enjoyed this film quite a lot. The plot could be viewed as a re-hatch but Cumberbatch was extraordinary in the role and it had a good feel. The pace of the film is good and you never get to that bored bit where you look at your watch to wonder how much more of this there is (the acid test for a film I feel!). I wonder if there will be a third as they very much returned things to the beginning of TOS so what to do next is unclear.

Good special effects, interesting though convoluted plot, a pretty good villain, nice redesign of the ship, plus the friction between Spock and Kirk is a nice little twist. But good lord, a good premise is run aground by the puerile dialogue and spotty acting. Who the hell wrote this script? The bridge crew (other than Spock) sound like cardboard cutouts in a high school play. And Pine as Kirk this time was awful. GQ looks and collagen lips are not enough to cut it. It's hard to believe this guy has the brains and temperament to captain a garbage scow much less a starship. Of course only Gen Y'ers are likely to believe the premise that a group of 20 somethings just out of school would be running the ship. Pity because with reasonable acting and dialogue, the movie could have been pretty darn good.",Star Trek Into Darkness
550,AvBaur,Star Trek Into Daftness,5,13 May 2013,"Well, that was kind of underwhelming...First, I should probably say that I've been a huge Star Trek fan since I was a child and that some of my frustrations with the film probably stem from its inconsistency with the lore and spirit of the Trek universe. I mean, those are hardly the movie's only problems, but I imagine someone unfamiliar with Star Trek beyond the 2009 movie might be much more forgiving of some of those flaws and be able to just lean back and enjoy the ride. Because the ""ride"" part is certainly the one thing this movie mostly excels at. The pacing is breathless, the visuals impressive, the actors charismatic, and the action often exciting, even as some of the action scenes, and indeed the entire structure of the film's plot, often feel like a mere rehash of its predecessor.Despite greatly enjoying J.J. Abrams' first installment, I'll admit I went into the sequel with some reservations, due to some persistent rumors about the villain and to the marketing materials seemingly working very hard to downplay the ""space adventure"" element and the fact that this is, indeed, a Star Trek movie. It turns out at least some of those concerns were unfounded, as the parts with people in leather jackets running around planet surfaces shooting guns are much less prominent than I feared and the majority of the action does take place on starships in space, involving a lot of familiar characters and places. I was, however, right about the villain (or villains, as it turns out) being quite problematic. Without delving into spoilers, I think I can safely say that the movie has two major villains, one of them a personified jumble of convoluted conspiracy theories (not too surprising, given screenwriter Bob Orci's political views), the other a blurred cypher without any background information or clear motivations, whose menace only becomes apparent in the context of the story when it's spelled out by a wholly gratuitous cameo appearance. This lack of clear character motivations makes for a pretty convoluted story, that paradoxically still manages to remain utterly predictable at every turn.You may wonder at this point why I still gave the movie an ""above average"" rating, when I clearly disliked so much about it. Well, as I hinted at in the beginning, I do think there is a lot to like about it (on a technical level, at the very least), and I do think that many non-Trekkies will probably enjoy it a lot more than I did. (Which is ironic, seeing that they worked so hard to shoehorn in quite a few contrived Trek references ""for the fans."") In fact, I think most everyone who worked on this movie did a pretty great job except for the screenwriters, which makes this the second year in a row where my biggest movie-related disappointment of the year was co-written by Damon Lindelof (although to be fair, the other two writers have been responsible for a fair number of clunkers over the years, as well). I'll probably rewatch the movie at least once to see if I can ignore its problems and just enjoy the more fun elements, but for now, I'm going to have to say it was mostly a letdown for me.",Star Trek Into Darkness
551,MyLadyLorna,all the things,6,5 September 2021,"I both like and hate this film.Kirk is horrific. And I say that while usually liking Chris Pine. But this is not James T. Kirk and I'm sick of this false version of him. He's nothing but a rebellious brat who never learns his lesson. Spare me.John Cho. I'm going to say something unfavorable here. Hikaru Sulu is not Korean. He is of Japanese heritage. Which is why the original actor, George Takei, was Japanese American. Not Korean. Cho gave a decent enough performance, but he should not have been cast as a Japanese character. Asians should not be considered interchangeable anymore, people. There are loads of brilliant actors of Japanese descent, even if you have to go to Japan to find them. And guess what? Most of them even speak English. Wow, who knew. *rolls eyes*I won't bother going too deep into my intense dislike of Zachary Quinto as Spock. He just doesn't work in that role, never has, never will. And while I like Zoe Saldana overall, she is not Nichelle Nichols, the woman who set the bar for Nyota Uhura that no one else will ever be able to touch.BUT, we do have Benedict Cumberbatch, and while I believe it would have been a smart choice to actually cast someone like Dev Patel for the role of Khan, Benedict saved this movie for me. Because he outperformed almost everyone. Except for Karl Urban and Simon Pegg who were solely used for comedic relief and did their jobs well, however pitiful their character development. I am not a Cumberbitch and never will be, but I appreciate a charismatic performance as much as the next person and Benedict sure delivered on that. You know it's bad when you're rooting for Khan all the way through the film because the crew of the Enterprise are so annoying.Except for Anton Yelchin as Chekov. You gave a good performance with the minuscule bit of screen-time tossed your way.

This movie is a ground-breaker! I remember how much I and the audience were affected, when I was a teenager, watching the original Star Wars, then later in life by Jurassic Park. This movie affected me in the same way, with exceptional effects, set designs, stunts, CGI and did it all with surprisingly great writing and acting. When Kirk (Chris Pine) witnessed the death of a friend, his acting was better than I have seen in a dramatic production. J.J. Abrams did a job worthy of an Oscar for his direction on this production and for ensuring that everything worked together cohesively. They tied into the future (original Star Trek series) and the 2009 movie production, that introduced us to this great cast, magnificently. They took some minor gaps from the original, and closed them brilliantly, but I do not want to spoil anything discussing them. I have not read any other reviews; this was written without any preconceived notions from other fans/critics. I am merely stating the impact that this movie had on me and my son, and actually, all of the audience in attendance with me, who all stood and gave a loud, round of applause for jobs well done! Afterward, even though none of us knew each-other, it felt like we were a community, as we discussed how this movie happily surprised us and struck us as a historical milestone. Keep up the great work! We want more, more, more!One note: I hope it was just the time that we viewed it, but my eight year old son was the only one in the theater under 30, with most of us closer to 50. This seemed very odd to me, as my son thoroughly enjoyed it, and I am certain any boy into action, adventure or science-fiction—as most are—would find it delightful. There was a simultaneous movie playing in the theater that was labeled as being furious and fast, that the younger crowd was interested in seeing. We saw that movie also, and though it was very good, it paled in comparison to what this movie offered. This movie had it all! I am surprised they were able to produce it for under 200 million.

554,RyanNilsen,J.J.'s Best Film Yet! - Star Trek Into Darkness,6,26 May 2013,"​By: Ryan Nilsen Star Trek Into Darkness Directed by: J.J. Abrams Starring: Chris Pine, Zachary Quinto, Benedict Cumberbatch, and Zoe SaldanaJ.J. ABRAMS HAS BECOME A sci-fi god at directing! This is the follow-up sequel to the quite remarkable 2009 reboot of the popular Star Trek franchise and it's a good one! Into Darkness is the best film Abrams has directed in his career. This film improved on many areas it had faulted with its predecessor such as acting, story, and screen flare! The big hubbub about the first Star Trek was Abrams usage of ""screen flare"", which is created with a specific type of lens used when filming that J.J. admires. What some thought was an overkill use of screen flare in Star Trek, I can assure you, Into Darkness's screen flare is nothing close to overkill and the actually just reflected the style Abrams elicits. It made us all know we were watching a J.J. Abrams flick. ​All actors gave terrific performances especially Benedict Cumberbatch (Sherlock). Cumberbatch plays the villain in this epic tale, a one John Harrison. John Harrison is actually a front for someone else a lot menacing, but at the risk of spoilers I won't go any further except if you go back and watch the old Star Trek The Wrath of Kahn then you may have some idea After John Harrison commits terrorist attacks on both London and Star Fleet, that's when Cpt. Kirk and his extraordinary crew (including Spock) must hunt him down and save worlds. Now, one of the many reasons Star Trek Into Darkness is one of the most anticipated movies of the year is because director J.J. Abrams has been selected to direct Star Wars Episode VII. Many fans were both excited and worried when news broke out that J.J. would be directing it, as they should be. Star Wars is without a doubt the most well-known movie franchise and top sci-fi movie ever made, so to be the guy continuing the story of a galaxy far, far, away comes a lot of pressure! In my opinion, I think J.J. Abrams is a fantastic director, whose films are getting better and better, and with his track record of Lost (2004-2010), Alias, Mission: Impossible III (2006), Star Trek (2009), Super 8 (2011), and now Star Trek Into Darkness he is more than capable of directing Star Wars Episode VII. Into Darkness will have you wanting more leaving the theater. It is ""good"" non-stop action filled with humor and Easter eggs for the die-hard fans. While Iron Man 3 was a premature blockbuster for the summer, Star Trek Into Darkness is the official kick-off to the summer blockbuster season!",Star Trek Into Darkness
555,rkoch1,"Seems good on surface, but ultimately dull plot",6,6 September 2017,"I thought this movie was good when I first watched it, but as I thought about it the next day I realized that it makes no sense. Captain Kirk holds Dr. Who the ""prisoner"" on his ship and protects him because he believed the prisoner's lie, and instead of negotiating logically with the star fleet captain, the star fleet captain opens fire on him...They end up forming an ""alliance"" to board the star fleet's ship and overthrow them. But then, the prisoner becomes hostile and turns on Captain Kirk. In the end, the prisoner takes control of the supership (instead of Kirk assuming control of the superior ship) and Kirk finds a clever way to destroy the super ship with the prisoner on it...So in the end, both ships were destroyed and the star fleet captain killed (along with his crew and daughter, I think. I don't remember because I fell asleep at some point). And ultimately the prisoner had evil intentions as well! So Captian Kirk essentially made the worst decision he could have made in bargaining with a prisoner and jeopardized the lives of thousands of crew members for an unnecessary and pointless cause (believing a lie). Then he is heralded as some sort of hero, when he could have obeyed his superior's orders and all of this could have been adverted!Of course, this is never addressed in the movie, and instead there is a long and sobby vaccum-chamber scene. I just hated all the slow gushy scenes in this movie and the close-ups of that actor's face all the time. It's like the movie was constructed for women to watch... young women.I'm a fan of science and science fiction though, so I still ""enjoyed"" this.",Star Trek Into Darkness

But characters are left to fade into the wallpaper and serve little purpose. Without putting in spoilers, the bad guys may as well have neon signs flashing above their heads saying boo-hiss! (They're that obvious!) Crew members who are not Kirk and Spock serve VERY little purpose. As a homage to earlier versions, OK, but why do we have to have classic lines/scenes re- shot and mangled? It is fun but if you're a fan of the original your appreciation of this movie may be affected. If you're above 5 years old you'll see key twists coming all too far away, particularly with the 'Neighbours-like' telegraphy of specific elements. Also, why oh why has Abrams ignored the testy and curmudgeonly McCoy so much this time round?",Star Trek Into Darkness

560,printzr,Entertainment for the non need for cognition audience,6,22 May 2013,"As a reviewer who has not watched any of the star trek videos growing up as a child, I guess I had low expectations for this movie. I did not watch the series, because I knew it had corny fight scenes such as the actors awkwardly dodging lasers in narrow hallways as they hold their lasers by their hips.Corny, if I could summarize the movie in one word, I would say that was the word. Whether it would be restoring the entire power of an entire spaceship with a single button or fixing the jigamajigger flux capacitor by banging it a few times, I can say I had more convincing action sequences as a kid playing legos. I would say, what made the movie worthwhile were the complexity of characters, drama and international relations. Spock for example was always at a conflict with himself and the emotions he had little of. By the end of the movie we see characters develop, personality change and an intriguing complex fountain of the star trek science fantasy world that I have come to appreciate. I did get into the scifi aspect of the movie, I really did, but how could I enjoy a movie when the action sequences chose to obey the laws of cartoons rather than reality. For that, I give it a 6/10.",Star Trek Into Darkness
561,Daryl_G_Morrissey,JJ Abrams remake of Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan,5,2 June 2015,"REVIEWThis has to be one of the most spectacular, non-stop, adrenaline-fuelled sci-fi movies... ever!However, it is could also be classed as a remake of Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan.JJ Abrams had a lot to live up to after his 2009 reboot and I think that he kept the pace up but just lacked an original story. There is nothing in this film to keep the purists happy and there is no need to have seen any of the series or previous films to understand this movie, for the new audience, as he has changed things so much that it could just be an ordinary sci-fi film, rather than Star Trek. Chris Pine made Kirk his own in the first movie, but seems to have lost his way, here. Zachary Quinto has become Spock and appears to understand his role in the franchise. Karl Urban, who was brilliant in the 2009 movie, is sadly just cast to rehash the original McCoy and is woefully underused. Simon Pegg, as Scotty, appears to be there just to bring humour to the crew. On the plus side, the effects are top-notch and the 3D actually works for this film. There's enough dialogue quoted from the original films and series to keep fans happy, but this does not a good movie make.My main issue with this film is the complete disregard for continuity. John Harrison has developed a transporter that came beam him anywhere, including to other planets. This, therefore, negates the need for Starships. But Kirk still needs his ship to get to Qo'nos. On the approach to Qo'nos there is a semi-destroyed moon, presumably Praxis (The Klingon moon that exploded in Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country), which should still be in one piece, at this time. The Klingons, obviously, make their first appearance in the series (having been cut from the 2009 film) and are different from what we have come to know. They are almost hybrids of every type of screen Klingon, ever seen. Plus, the Klingons are overwhelmed and beaten far too easily, by Kirk and company. The revelation that John Harrison, woodenly played by Benedict Cumberbatch, is in fact none other than Khan Noonien Singh, is nonsensical as Khan has suddenly been changed from an Indian to an Englishman. Some scenes were directly lifted from Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan, but were given a JJ Abrams twist. And, to make matters worse, Spock contacts Spock Prime to find out how to beat Khan, rather than finding the answer himself. This, to me, seemed like a bit of a cop-out, as now he can just contact Spock Prime at the first sign of trouble.",Star Trek Into Darkness

563,tagheue,it kinda shows that J.J. has moved on,6,27 August 2013,"I almost haven't seen anything out of the original Star Trek series and feature films. I was aware of Kahn and his caliber as a villain, but that's it. So, the first Abrahms movie didn't bothered me as much as it did the hard core fans. Actually, I have found it enjoyable.But then, I have watched this sequel. And, as usual, it is weaker than the ""original"". It still looks right. It is still flashy, modern but retro in the same time, the style is spot on. The actors all deliver, the story ain't bad, it ain't good either but it is OK. Basically you would expect the movie to work. It doesn't. My personal comment on this is that it is soulless. Frankly, this entire ordeal of Kirks coming of age story kinda tires me. It is a centerpiece of this movie and it would have been better if it wasn't. Than, we were promised klingons...we get one scene with them, face to face I mean, and even then, most of them are wearing helmets... And you never know who the real villain is. You have got the klingons, Khan and that admiral fellow on villain rotation. I like twists in a story, but this is a roundabout...2 good things did come out of this movie: 1) the performance made by Cumberbatch as a villain. It is superb and by my opinion, it should have landed him the role of Batman, not Affleck.... 2) that scene with the blonde in nothing but underwear. I know that the filmmakers took a lot of heat including that picture in the trailer, and it is considered sexist and all that stuff, but honestly, in a movie filled with all sorts of eye candy, that scene takes the prize.",Star Trek Into Darkness

But I always loved Start Trek and have seen the a lot of TV episodes of the original series and Next generation and much of the rest. They all had characters, personalities, drama and last minute solutions to problems that could destroy the universe. Into Darkness lacked all of that. Although I grant you it was Star Trek, it was written for teenagers that like things crashing and exploding and don't care about characters, personalities and dramas. Way too much of the movie was things crashing, exploding and all that stuff. There were the usual fights but they were also not that good. About 30 minutes of the movie was interesting.

566,dmcmillan01,A wild ride through space,9,19 May 2013,"I went to see the movie but was prepared not to really get excited by it. But watching this movie, I had a blast. And the audience applauded afterward. I was fortunate to see the very first episode of the original TV Star Trek. Became an instant fan forever. However, there were a few minor things that I think would have made it even better. The first one: Spock looked a lot like the original, but his method of delivering lines should have been more precise so he sounded less like the other crew members. I knew Leonard Nimoy at the Pasadena Playhouse School and even then his speech was perfectly clipped to play Spock. The second thing: The movie was a bit overdone. Some action scenes lasted too long. Overkill is not always that enjoyable. The third thing is that at the very end they should have said ""Course Captain?"" ""Second star to the right and straight on 'til morning"" Of course it's a quote from Peter Pan, but it's remembered just as much from Captain Kirk in Star Trek. It is incredible that a TV series that was canceled almost before it got a good start has lasted so long, and fought and won the hearts and minds of so many fans.",Star Trek Into Darkness

Seriously, I enjoyed myself all of the way through. The performances were excellent, especially Chris Pine, Zachary Quinto and Benedict Cumberbatch, who doesn't just rip off Ricardo Montalbán from Star Trek II. Also, after watching The Wrath of Khan, I can safely say that I can't grasp people saying that Into Darkness is the same film, the plot is completely different. Why does The Force Awakens get a pass from tons of people even though it is way more similar to Star Wars than this is to The Wrath of Khan (I still really like TFA though)? The characters are extremely well developed, and I loved that every core member of the Enterprise got a moment to shine (I loved Sulu's speech to the Klingon's). Overall the only problems I saw were the fake out death of Kirk and some too obvious visual riffs from The Wrath of Khan (I don't mind the big ""KHAAAAN!"" as it adds to Spock's character in a different way than it did to Kirk in Star Trek II. Maybe it was my lowered expectations, but I adored this film, just as much as I adored The Wrath of Khan.",Star Trek Into Darkness
568,davegreen-04041,Fantastic!!!!,10,31 July 2018,The best Star Trek film so far. Great acting and a truly mind blowing story line.,Star Trek Into Darkness
569,Left-Handed_Liz,Boldly going where other movies have gone before,6,16 May 2013,"I'm going to say right off the bat that I had big expectations for this film. Having seen two other summer movies that turned out to be terrific, and being teased by every new trailer for months (who the heck is Benedict Cumberbatch supposed to be?!!), I was set to have my mind blown, or at least be entertained. As it turns out, my mind is still intact, and now I'm floating out in the dark nebulous between satisfied and underwhelmed. Watching this film is a lot like watching scenes from Back to the Future Part II, where Michael J. Fox is back at the Enchantment Under the Sea dance, only now it's shot at a different angle. Star Trek Into Darkness does some clever and exciting things with familiar tropes and story lines, but even though it's reminiscent of another original scene, the new version frequently comes up the lesser of the two. The first movie was rife with lip service to fans- mentions of offscreen characters, the Kobayashi Maru, Leonard Nimoy's cameo as future Spock, lines that everyone thinks they remember (""Dammit, Jim, I'm a doctor, not a *fill in the blank*"")- but they still came up with an original story, to ease us into the idea of an altered continuity for our favorite characters. That film was solidly entertaining, but the plot came second to characters and set pieces. The sequel goes further, with lip service in story. When we learn that the villain is involved in Section 31, I was expecting a high-stakes chase after a rogue former agent, a la Skyfall. The bombing scenes in the beginning were certainly similar to that movie, but, much like Christopher Nolan's third Batman film, the director kept the story a mystery, then lied about what it was when fans started to figure it out. I wouldn't say Cumberbatch is miscast in his role necessarily, but the script doesn't give him much to work with, and fans will probably be loath to accept him as the new version of an iconic character. This is not to say that rehashed plot points don't ever pay off. Simple reversal of which characters are in a situation and how the events play out can be highly effective and rewarding. More frustrating, though, is that the film doesn't stand alone. The way that it ends kicks off a new saga, without really resolving much of what was at stake before. They literally stick the antagonist in a refrigerator like leftovers to use in a later film. It's understandable, given how big-budget films basically get handed a franchise these days if they make back their budget, but a two-hour movie is too dissimilar to a television serial to be treated like one. So why don't I hate this movie? Because although I disagree with how the story was handled, I still think that it had a lot of great aspects. The enemy in the last film was the Romulans and their giant mining drill, plain and simple. In this one, the antagonist comes from many directions, and the Enterprise is always outnumbered and under pressure, which leads to some exciting action scenes and clever maneuvers. The main protagonists are wonderful as always; Kirk comes into his own as the shrewd mind that we know and love, and the supporting cast is perfect. And in spite of the grimmer tone promised by the title, there are a lot of laugh-out-loud funny moments between characters, as well as some very solid drama. In spite of divisive attitudes about JJ Abrams as a director and Star Trek as a franchise, I think there's definitely an audience for this movie, if the excited Trekkies down in front were any indication. It just wasn't the thrill ride I hoped it would be throughout, and I was disappointed when it was over. The trailer promised heavy consequences for the ensuing conflict, and while we got a lot of action and a lot of peril, potentially game-changing events didn't really pop out. There was no equivalent to Vulcan's destruction, and even though the threat of danger keeps you on the edge of your seat, it doesn't go as far as it could.",Star Trek Into Darkness
570,Topgallant,Entertaining But Not For Die Hard Fans,7,20 May 2013,"No real spoilers here, just some overall criticisms and warnings to real Trekkie's. First of all, I'm not a 3-d expert, but this movie -- having been converted from IMAX -- treats 3-d as an afterthought. There are no surprise moments. That said, here's what you can expect.Consistent and well-channeled characterizations from the cast, who give us young versions of Kirk, Spock and the gang as envisioned and portrayed by Roddenberry, Shatner, Nimoy, etc. This follows in the footsteps of the Abrams' reboot, and kudos to all the actors for not trying to find a new spin on a tried and true winner.Given the above, there seemed to be a little too much emoting forced on the characters in the story, as if the producers tried extra hard to hit the audience with ""special"" relationship moments. When this happens in the movie, and it happens several times, you can't help yourself from rolling your eyes a little. There is no subtlety in this respect, just on the nose character stuff, and you can see it coming from a parsec away.Telegraphing is chronic problem here, as once again we find ourselves skirting an alternate time-line scenario, in this case, lifted directly from one of the original series' story-lines. Without giving away details, I will just say, there is homage, and there is just plain lazy writing. Again, when stuff starts to happen here, and fans recognize the parallels between the original story and this one, there is virtually no doubt what will transpire. Fans familiar with the original story will be one step ahead of the writers during the entire third act, which means, don't expect to be on the edge of your seat. Trust me, for Trekkie's, the suspense in the third act will disappear like plasma through a black hole.Another negative is the blatant disregard for Trek Universe logic. The opening sequence is a prime example. It's designed to establish a character plot point -- and that's all. Nobody paid any attention to the design and operational parameters of the original USS Enterprise, or, if they did, they deliberately ignored them for the sake of creating eye candy.Bottom line: Good acting. A great antagonist. Decent effects. An OK story. Bad Trekkie Universe logic. Good Trek character interactions. Unnecessary melodrama, including a major character moment that needed to wait for the 6th installment. A telegraphed third act with no surprises. Not as good as the first one. Unnecessary 3-d. Three or four very funny come- backs (my favorite being about ""attitude"".) Fun despite the problems.Even a bad trek movie is a great time at the theater. And this one isn't bad, just slightly disappointing.",Star Trek Into Darkness

I really wished I could give that to you, or that at least it was OK. But 2 hours watching things explode and people yell and run and say stupid, sentimental BS to each other in the most predictable ways just doesn't cut it for me anymore. Maybe it's because I'm no longer 17, and I've seen that sort of movie too many times already.Let me just say this for the few that still demand a little respect for their intellect. This movie will not give it to you. You will see lots of explosions - really, really lots of it. You will see people running around. And that's about 90% of the movie. The rest is people talking like it matters, but only platitudes that have been said 10000 times before come out. The friendship of Kirk and Spock, which is supposedly the emotional core of the story, is simply a joke. The bad guy is a cardboard-cutout type you see in every second movie. Scotty is the only one saying a few funny lines, but as a character he is just as hollow as everything else.To sum it up: same old, same old. I guess if you're under 25 and haven't seen that thing 1000 times already, you might find it entertaining in a very shallow way.

Then he survives a 60+ m cliff-jump, then sends Spock with a shuttle to arm a device over an erupting volcano. A device that could have been well armed aboard the shuttle but this would have robbed us of the scene where the enterprise rises out of the sea (because they had to hide the ship at the bottom of the sea... because... sorry there isn't simply any reason why they had to hide her there other than to justify the expensive CGI scene where the enterprise is lifted out of the sea).Then the natives form a new religion around the Enterprise and everyone lives happily ever after.And this is just the beginning of the blundering mess that should have never existed...The expensive CGI are about the only redeeming points of the movie, if only they didn't put a lens flare in every second shot...Kirk spends half of the movie crying. The alternate universe plot of the first part of the reboot is silently slipped under the rug. The ship in which Kahn attacks the Federation officers has only basic mounted lasers (after blowing up a building with a ring). Disarming the torpedo spares us the timer that stops at ""1"" but instead has super-intelligent sensors that trap Bone's arm when he cuts the wrong wire but then suddenly disarms when the ""hot blonde scientist"" rips out the whole mechanism... because wtf... that's what she learned at the academy, when all super-complicated disarming methods fail, just rip out the detonator, that will surely work! The descent on Kronos is made in a brand new, non-starfleet issue shuttle, that appears out of nowhere, looks cool and is the perfect size to fit through the tunnels during the chase... Kahn is British, because British ppl are ofc. the symbols of evil. The acting is abysmal, you can literally not follow the character as you are forced to wonder why he words every sentence like a dyslexic. The Klingons are threatening the Amer... ahem... Federation way of life. Uhura and Spock are now a couple... and Spock is more and more illogical in his emotional escapades. This time around it's Kirk's turn to provide the near-death in the reactor at the end after Spock did it last time...Halfway through the movie I just gave up any hope it would get any better or be more logical and just started enjoying the tragic-comedy I was presented with. Now if this where just a B Stephen Segal movie I wouldn't mind... problem is it's not and I shouldn't have to compare the two.Simply sad... Star Trek is truly dead.",Star Trek Into Darkness

Typical of the type of trick studios use to promote a movie that WAS NOTHING BUT A DISGUSTING WASTE OF FILM FROM BEGINNING TO END! The Sooner Abrams leaves the better! Let him go destroy some other franchise! And his employees can then write all sorts of hilariously over-the-top reviews for those movies instead! LOL!",Star Trek Into Darkness
574,jnaps098,Star Trek Returns,5,16 May 2013,"I absolutely loved the previous film. It was a huge tip of the hat to the Star Trek legacy. It turned a couple of things inside out which made it interesting, fresh and exciting. And with a few surprises thrown in, it was a perfect package.Into Darkness is just more of the same. The whole movie has J.J. Abrams and team continuing taking old plots & events and putting it in their alternate time line. The film is chock a block with these this time around. Sadly its not novel anymore and it all seems forced. Like Superman Returns, the film makers got so busy with what has happened that they just forgot to do anything new with it.Its disappointing to admit that after 2 movies, there actually isn't anything new added to the Star Trek universe. Not one single thing. In fact, now the Enterprise has been built, damaged, repaired, damaged and repaired for the second time (No spoiler here. The poster has the ship going down in flames), and they have not yet started on their space voyages, which is what the ship was build for, the purpose of the crew, the core and essence of Star Trek.",Star Trek Into Darkness
575,tanyaian,Excellent followup to the first movie,10,21 September 2013,"One of my favourite science fiction/ Star Trek movies. Great story re imagination of the famous characters Khan. Khan is brilliantly played by Benedict Cumberbatch. A great story line that has you gripped from start to finish. It has all the essentials from Klingon's to superb sound, special effects, brilliant acting, you won't be disappointed. I now own this on Blu ray and it never gets boring. After initially saying there was room for improvement after watching it a few times it is an excellent sequel that stand alongside the first as a true Sci Fi classic.",Star Trek Into Darkness
576,markbyrn-1,J.J. Abrams gives the Bird to Gene Roddenberry,8,19 May 2013,"While the film was generally more entertaining than your typical action flick, J.J. Abrams mocks the original vision of Star Trek as created by Gene Roddenberry, and replaces it with a dark, dangerous, contradictory, and dumb downed vision. Per J.J. Abrams, we're suppose to believe that the ""Starflleet"" of the future is mostly dysfunctional and composed of murderous high ranking rogue militarists (as led by Admiral Marcus) and rogue immature idealists (Jim Kirk) who defy orders and lie at the drop of their silly German military style dress uniforms and caps. One of the most absurd points in the film occurred near the end where a rogue Starfleet ship plows into the heart of San Francisco; it causes epic destruction and makes 9-11 look like a fender bender. Sometime later, Kirk gives a speech at Starfleet HQ about lost Starfleet personnel as though the horrific carnage of San Francisco that was directly caused by Starfleet never happened. In short, the films gives us a moronic and violent dystopia as though J.J. Abrams is giving the middle finger to Gene Roddenberry's creation. So if you can get past that and turn your brain off to enjoy the mayhem, action, and Star Treks humor, you'll probably enjoy it.",Star Trek Into Darkness
577,interquam,Star Trek ID follows the scent of Gene..,7,10 May 2013,"This movie is unlike the originals of Gene Roddenberry. JJ Abrams follows and listens like a good student...still a looooooong way to go for Abrams.This film follows the scent of the original keeping the emotional integrity. Keep in mind no human life was shown as being redundant in the original(not expendable), even small cameos from unknowns have a story of their own....this film tries to do that but falls short some places.Abrams does not insult Roddenberry's intelect nor impede his domain. He charts his own with honesty.THUMBS UP for taking PETER WELLER in the film. Although not much to do or say, i have immense respect for the man--10/10 for him being in it. Thank You Abrams.Im absolutely NO Fan of Alex kurtzman. But he cracks the ice with some help.Pine, Quinto, Pegg, Urban, Yelchin, Greenwood and the rest of the crew do a commendable job. Not disappointed one bit. Great actors before this project. No one can do better than them although i never liked Saldana.Small and welcome cameo from Nimoy.Cumberbatch, as he grows old and haggard will make a career with future star trek films as Khan Noonien Singh. Thank You and RIP Ricardo.Nice enterprise ship and good CGI and not overrated...Looking forward to future films....Money back guarantee........Wont say much..WATCH IT..",Star Trek Into Darkness
578,pk_nayar,"As a Non-Trekkie, Loved It!",8,23 May 2013,"Star Trek Into Darkness was the kickstart that I needed for the summer film season, especially after the underwhelming Iron Man 3. JJ Abrams second outing started off with a bang, the initial sequence was breathtaking, considering that I watched it unfold in glorious IMAX 3D (and I hate 3D, wanted to watch it in IMAX 2D, but my cinema only showed the film in IMAX 3D)!!And the fun did not stop there, as the film continuously thrilled me with its fantastic action sequences and humour. The CGI was amazing as is expected from the geniuses at ILM. At times, I was wowed by what I was watching, the volcano scene, the bombing of Section 31 & the Vengeance crashing. The music was a major plus point for me, I was humming the theme (Enterprising Young Men) as I walked out of the cinema. JJ Abrams does a solid job yet again, he does not disappoint. The screenplay though might irk some longtime Trekkies due to its similarity with The Wrath of Khan, in fact some might even consider it a poor rehash. I am not a big Trekkie, in fact I have only watched Abrams' 2009 reboot & a few episodes of The Next Generation, so I loved how this film was handled in terms of storyline. It had some socio-political undertones which mirrors our current state of affairs.Moving on to the cast, for me, Benedict Cumberbatch was head & shoulders above the rest, playing his character with ease and menace. Zachary Quito was excellent as well, with Spock showing a wider range of emotion. The rest were adequately used as each had their individual story arcs fully fleshed out. Plus I also loved the new look of the Klingons on their planet, here's hoping we get them as villains for the 3rd film.I would give this a high rating as I thoroughly enjoyed, best movie of the year thus far for me.",Star Trek Into Darkness
579,rjromero202,This generation of Star Trek.,8,26 May 2013,"Review on Star Trek Into Darkness: Now I have never been a fan of Star Trek but after I saw Star Trek (2009) film I absolutely loved it. This generation of Star Trek is incredible and yes I am of a fan of this Star Trek. So of course I was anxious to see the second installment and I have to say what an awesome movie. The visual effects were stunning, the sound was fantastic and Lets not forget the acting from Cumberbatch as khan, it was as captivating as Heath ledger's joker in The Dark Knight (2008) yes it was that good. Honestly to me this is the sleeper movie of the summer. Trust me when I say go see this film, you will enjoy it.",Star Trek Into Darkness
580,midnight_demon2502,A return to familiar characters.,10,19 May 2013,"Finally Abrams has tied in his reboot with the original characters. This alone made the movie great.As a fan of all the actors I was really underwhelmed by the likeness in the previous movie to the characters' personalities. It was like a complete reinvention of the characters.THIS MOVE CORRECTED THAT MISTAKE!!!!! Finally Abrams had his actors acting like the original characters, save for Chekov. He still has a bit to go to capture that character.Self entitled little kids are going to whine and complain for instant gratification, but that doesn't change that this was a masterpiece for the series. It completely rewrote the original sequel while maintaining some of its integrity.I face palmed at some of what I thought was leading up to rehashed scenes from the sequel only to be surprised again and again.No true Trekkie will dislike this film, only those falsely claiming to be Trekkies. My dad and I were quite entertained and can't wait for the next installment. Given the past failures of the Next Generation movies, that's saying a lot for a couple of old die hard fans.",Star Trek Into Darkness
581,TheNineOrders,Boldly go where no man has gone before...,5,19 May 2014,"...except when it comes to fresh ideas to reignite this franchise. The new Star Trek is just dumb entertainment. Out of the many possible scenarios to play out Khan they chose the lamest and most over complicated path. Visually it is still striking, just not as compelling as the initial installment.Plot: A terrorist wages war against the Federation in a one man army style with a character that would give Man of Steel a run for his money. The writers went so far out in ingenuity creating portable tele transporting devices and 'super blood' and then simply gloss over the incredible discoveries as if they were of little importance when they are the greatest devices in the film. There are no surprises in the film, not even the reveal of Khans' identity, which they try to emphasize with melodramatic tones and camera effect, is that much of a reveal. I love Pine as the new Kirk and Bones and Scotty are the necessary comic relief that add some dimension to the film.Verdict: Star Trek is not a bad movie by any stretch of the imagination, it just leaves so much to be desired in an era of advanced technological prowess when it comes to movie making today. The five rating is simply for the lackluster story. Enjoyable popcorn crunching film.",Star Trek Into Darkness
582,shayislandshay,Great but not Star Trek,5,10 January 2016,"STID is an entertaining,big budget,action packed space flick most teen agers surely enjoyed watching.The special effects are amazing.The casting was better than anyone could have imagined,and damn that Chris Pine looks eerily like a young Shatner at times.Technically,STID is a grade A film.Unfortunately,it is also a travesty on so many levels.Let me begin with the most glaring ones.JJ Abrahms admitted he never liked Star Trek the franchise yet they still let him make the movie.As a result,he turned the Star Trek Universe from an intelligent,evolved and very progressive world into a rightwingers wet dream.Fightin da turrists,war,guns and explosions. Remember Star Trek,how futuristic everything was portrayed? Well in THIS universe,Murikkka hasn't changed much.Helicopter like flying machine is able to get right up to the windows of a major national security meeting in a skyscraper.Shoots right through the glass.Spock has an open relationship with Uhura and takes a smart alec attitude when questioned by Pike after breaking the Prime Directive.People still go to sleezy bars on the corner to get wasted too interestingly.So much for evolved humans lol.The clothing is downright primitive looking for supposingly being so far into the future.The Enterprise has a glaring white interior,i thought I was watching Space Odyssey 2001.There is zero space or science exploration in this faux Star Trek universe...just good ole fashioned violence.But then again Abrahms destroyed Vulcan for a reason..he was warning the viewers....the war on intelligence has just begun,and the dumbing down of Murikkka must be maintained!",Star Trek Into Darkness
583,snottyscotty150,"I do not know. Right now, I am failing.",5,18 February 2014,"Star Trek into Darkness, it is slightly odd title for a star trek movie. Still when the title was announced like so many others I was excited, finally a star trek movie that had done the hard part of reintroducing the characters to a new audience in the first movie could now seriously go where no one has gone before.When the trailers come out I was even more excited, but as soon as I got in the cinema to watch it, and as the film progressed I realised this wasn't the Star Trek into Darkness I wanted to see. Not being too critical of the movie I can honestly say that the action sequences are some of the best, and the cast is perfect they all build upon the roles of the previous film and make the film more enjoyable.However my biggest issue is the script. By now you probably know the big secret that Khan is back, this isn't a bad thing by any means and I can see why they done it but it's annoying when the story was building up to something possibly new. I remember watching it for a second time and one of my friends saying when Scotty was going to the co-ordinates and the shuttle was going over the space station ""no way that have the borg in this?!"" I'll be honest my friend is very much into the borg but thinking about it wouldn't that have been a much better idea if John Harrison (like the original series version) did actually go where no man has gone before and his reason for destroying starfleet headquarters was actually to prevent them ever finding the borg. However Kirk and co awaken them from a sleep which somehow can link it back to the motion picture through V'ger. Now that would be a much fresher approach to the characters and the interactions, rather than the story that we got which tried to force the film to be a new Star Trek II Wrath of Khan but with certain situations reversed. This wasn't anything new or original to the franchise and for me as a star trek fan it upsets me that this is the second time that they have done this (the first being with Nemesis...look it up its Star Trek II but with the next generation cast). The idea of them recycling the same story over and over again because it's the most popular doesn't make it any better. If anything it makes me appreciate Star Trek II more but also hate it more, which is sad. So as you can tell my opinion is that this film is good from an action point of view and the performances are brilliant from all the cast, but the script is horrible.For me as a fan I will still be waiting for Star Trek into Darkness with a franchise that from the last film had so many possibilities it is disappointing that this film was made. If J.J wanted to take something from Star Trek II he should have taken the Genesis device...Vulcan was destroyed in the last movie, it would make sense to have that here. But introduce a new villain and expand the world, move the story forward. It annoyed me with the last movie that they played safe and Kirk and Co didn't go through the black hole, this one annoyed me because its just a remake but its trying to cover up the fact its a remake which is frustrating. I'm not a hater of J,J I think hes fantastic (just look at my Mission Impossible III review) but I do feel he didn't take enough risks with this film and wasted the opportunity he had to expand the world and introduce new and more original ideas.",Star Trek Into Darkness
584,h-44584,To boldly redo what's already been done before,1,18 February 2020,"Only good thing about this movie is Benedict Cumberbatch's acting. For that it gets one star.The rest is just a typical J.J. Abrams millennial blockbuster. Rehashed, recycled, cutified content without an iota of creativity or a semblance of a decent, thought-provoking plot. No depth, lousy dialogues, and an awful attempt at humor.You could see everything coming from light years away because, well, you've actually seen it all before in 1982. Shameful plagiarism at its best. It's sad that at a time when the world is seeing some of the best series being created, the producers of some of the best Sci-Fi franchises (Trek, Star Wars, etc...) cannot assemble a few decent writers to keep the tradition going without dragging those stories into mud.",Star Trek Into Darkness

All in all in was a very enjoyable flick, a slick fun ride, excitement, humour, quirky characters and it ""felt"" like Star Trek.ST Into Darkness overwhelms all these idiosyncrasies with typical blockbuster formulaic devices, the use of music, the plot forced into situations for crucial decisions, the never ending escalation of ""tension"", the betrayal(s)etc. etc.While some reviewers have complained about plot inconsistencies I would say that these are usually forgiven or overlooked when one is caught up with the characters and story of a movie that captivates on an emotional level, with ST Into Darkness this does not happen at least not for either my wife nor I.If you want a big summer movie and are not overly concerned with this being as close to the spirit of ST as the original series, movies and Abrams' reboot then enjoy! If you are looking for a film with an emotional connection to the spirit and feel of same then I dare say you will be left feeling empty, very much style(summer blockbuster)over substance.*Sigh*, the pursuit of money has made it increasingly difficult for writers and directors to make films that are not dictated by the investment requirements.

On top of all that, this has got to be one of the most carefully choreographed action films. Each scene - the composition, the body language, the movements (including camera), etc – is an exquisite design in impeccable coordination with the music score. When characters make eye contact you can literally see how their sight travels across the screen.

588,romrot-mechanikos,Brilliant Spectacular Addition to the Star Trek Series,8,22 May 2013,"So Star Trek 2? or 12? was a really good movie. I seriously enjoyed it.Now firstly I just want to get this off my chest, JJ I think you do good work...sometimes...but you don't know how to do space battles. Except for like two scenes, I could never tell what was going on in the battles, everything was just too dark or fast. Which some people might actually like, but personally I found it annoying. Other than that I felt like other direction was good, Character scenes, which I'm glad there was more of in this movie as opposed to the first one which was more action, um I felt like they were well paced, the acting was excellent, whoever did the casting for this did an excellent job getting the right people for the job. Everyone looks, sounds and most importantly acts the part that they were meant for. Especially Karl Urban as Bones, Simon Pegg as Scotty and Zach Quinto as Spock.Karl Urban, did a very good job playing Bones. lines delivered exactly as I would have expected to hear them if they were being delivered by the original DeForest Kelly. Simon Pegg as Scotty is just hilarious, not in a bad way. in a very good way the way that old scotty was funny and Zach plays a very believable half Vulcan human trying to hold in his feelings and in the movie when he does loose control of his feelings wow. But all of the actors did great I just felt like they did the best.Also the scenery in the movie and visuals were beautiful and spectacular. Like Future London and *Spoilers!*The Enterprise rising from the ocean and the Dreadnaught class ship coming out of warp right in front of the Enterprise to show how massive it is in comparison*spoilers!* I guess the only thing I have a real problem with is the story, which is not bad by an means in fact in a lot of areas it was very clever. Though it felt more like a Star Trek movie than the previous one in 2009 It still had a few problems. They might be minor to people who are not fans of Star Trek like me, but I've felt like the recent Star Treks have been turning into Star Wars. Too much action not enough ethical dialogue, Star Trek was always good at bringing up moral dilemmas, I never got that with this movie(or the last one for that matter) But I still think its worth a watch, its probably one of the best movies that came out so far this year in fact I would say it is the best movie I have seen so far this year.",Star Trek Into Darkness

This latest movie certainly has a mediocre script, but the direction, acting and editing are just superb. I used to think that the script was the most important part of a movie, but I can see how excellent execution can redeem suspect story lines. I feel like the reboot movies by Abrams are for people with ADD, which the majority of this nation has become when it comes to films. I can watch both this movie and the 2009 film over and over again. Abrams keeps the visuals stunning and the camera in constant motion, except for scenes where it needs to be still for certain emotional responses. Now that he is taking over Star Wars, I hope he continues to helm Star Trek, too, but regardless, the tone has been set. And I for one can't wait for the next movie which will likely involve the Kilingons! Live long and prosper, Star Trek franchise!!!

Abrams's version of wrath of Khan.Yup boys and girls.But its a good one.The same good solid performances from the cast from the previous installment are here.Of course we see more of Kirk and Spock,maybe a tad more but thats my view.Good effects good directing.Its a classic.But i don't give this a 10 because 1.Too many damn coincidences for the plot to roll.I mean Scotty just happens to have a shuttle available and goes to find the secret starship and nobody notices????Khans blood revives Kirk.What if Bones didn't notice the fungus.And they buried Kirk.Or what if Scotty was late by a second during the jump ship sequence.Tchekhov holds Kirk which in turn holds Scotty in a cliffhanger(literally) and his arm doesn't come of???A 80 kgr guy holds 200 kgr with one hand?If it was Arnold on that scaffold i would buy it but Tchekhov????Spock jumps of a moving carthing and lands easily with no scratch on another one in a scene reminiscent of SW episode 2 and continues to fight Khaan?Khaan who single handedly wiped out a company of Klingons????!!!!And so on.Come ON guys!!!I mean i know this is a movie and in movies impossible things happen but,dude this is a J.J. Abrams movie not a Uwe Boll one(shivers up and down my spine).The script should have been dusted a little more carefully in my opinion. 2.I didn't enjoy Klingons a lot.Maybe because it was for a few minutes.But i remember each time a bird of prey appeared out of nowhere.You knew things were about to get nasty..Perhaps in this one it was due to a lack of a good music score to enhance the tension of the moment.Or that we get a glimpse of Klingons and not a very good one i might add.

So, while this film borrows quite a number of elements from the series and earlier films, I doubt that it contains any story element that will be cited in the future. Anyway, it is a typical modern action film.I find the way that Kirk and especially Spock are characterized questionable. Maybe it's modern Hollywood standard to show people controlled by their emotions rather than controlling their emotions, but for Spock and even for Kirk it's out-of-character.Visuals: There are a number of cool things to see, where the 3D effect enhanced the experience; I especially liked the machine room, which was more detailed than I remember it from earlier Star Trek films. However, in a number of scenes the 3D is broken: e.g., double pictures instead of 3D effect (my friend beside me confirmed this, so it was not just that my brain failed to resolve the 3D effect); a series of individual pictures instead of the illusion of motion (missing motion blur?); lens-flare-like effects.

Kirk and Spock with the Star-ship crew chase this bad guy and capture him as a prisoner. After that a little twist involved in the story which may increase curiosity in audience.The story also shows the emotions involved between Kirk and Spock as good friends. Spock (an alien character) who thinks logically and never get angry can also feel deep love inside for a human being that is very well shown with perfect scenes in the movie.The actors have great job.

Plothole Spoilers...Star fleet can now effectively transport across the universe, pretty much eliminating the need for space ships other than for exploration of unmapped systems. Khan and his people have super blood that can reverse death, they are also left in a forced coma at the end of the film creating a potentially inexhaustible supply of miracle cure and genetic potential. Star Fleet has them and is almost impossibly unlikely to use them for this.

595,MovieCraz,Brilliant movie that was rushed at the end.,8,14 August 2016,"First of all if you haven't seen Star Trek (2009) then stop now and go watch that movie before this one. (And read my review) Already seen it? Good. Let's continue.Just like the first film, this one was great. Was it as good as the first? Almost. If you have read my Star Trek (2009) review you will know that I love the cast. They all have great chemistry, deliver their lines brilliantly, and totally fit each and every one of their parts. Bringing in Benedict Cumberbatch to play Kahn was absolutely the right casting choice. He does an amazing job as Kahn in every way.This movie reflects the other very much. Great script, funny jokes, and great acting. But here are the things I think should have been worked on a bit more:1: The ending was rushed. By the time you realize Kahn in a villain (that is if you have never seen Star Trek: The Wrath of Kahn) the movie seems to speed at a hundred miles an hour to finish.2: Spock and Uhurah's pushed aside romance. I loved their relationship in the last movie. They made and completed the movie in my opinion. In this one however their romance seemed to be pushed in the background, as if they were trying to find a way to end it quietly. (which thankfully doesn't happen here.) Spock and Uhura have so much chemistry it's crazy. As I have said in my last review, I hope we end up seeing them tying the knot in the fourth installment. I want to see a Star Trek movie with a legit married couple and not the 'dating everyone on the ship without making any commitments' thing I see in almost every Star Trek film. Please give us more Spock and Uhura!3: What's the point of space ships if you can use a portable teleporter to beam half way across the galaxy?4:As much as I love Chris Pine as Kirk, he should have stayed dead. For once I felt sad knowing a main character died in an act of selflessness. It made me emotional and made me realize 'Hey. If they'll kill off Kirk who else is going to die!?' I love it when I don't know what's going to happen next. The suspense that something might happen to a beloved character just draws you in. But once again, as in many movies, he didn't really die.

If public reaction to the previous movie taught this creative team anything, it's that nobody cares about loyalty to lore or character as long as the action is frenetic enough to keep them from actually paying attention.

And while this movie is certainly deserving of such an epic thrashing, for the sake of your patience, dear reader, I'll try to keep this brief...ish.""Into Darkness"" picks up where its predecessor left off: with a gaggle of idiots controlling the Enterprise. Not only do Kirk, Spock, McCoy, Uhura, and Scotty still act nothing like their original counterparts, it's even clearer now how much they DON'T deserve to serve on a starship, let alone command one. Kirk has no respect for the authority of his superiors, and none of Kirk's subordinates respect him. Officers will cut their captains off mid-sentence, because they're having arguments with their boyfriends, and heaven forbid a Starfleet mission interrupt that! I've seen Cartoon Network shows that depict military command structure more respectfully.When a chunk of Starfleet's leadership is killed by some guy named John Harrison (played by Benedict Cumberbatch), Admiral Marcus orders Kirk to follow Harrison to the Klingon homeworld and kill him - specifically, by bombing him. A Starfleet admiral ordering Kirk to bomb the Klingon capital? Won't that start a war? Yes, and that's the (predictable) twist the film is building to: Marcus is the villain, roping Starfleet into a pointless war for his own reasons. And John Harrison isn't the fugitive's real name. His REAL name... is KHAN. Dun dun duuun!You remember Khan, right, from Star Trek II? The original Khan (the REAL Khan) was played by Mexican actor Ricardo Montalbán. Benedict Cumberbatch is British. I'm not going to accuse the film of racism, because I'm convinced none was intended; I think they just wanted Cumberbatch's star power. But it is UNBELIEVABLY distracting to have Khan randomly turn into a British guy! Am I meant to believe that time-travel nonsense with Nero's stupid red matter somehow changed Khan's nationality? Khan was in suspended animation before all that started; it wouldn't have affected him!Admiral Marcus proves too bland a villain, so the film has Khan bump him off and take the helm. This allows Cumberbatch to show off how he can't possibly compete with Montalbán in this role. Montalbán's Khan, while cunning and ruthless, was still dashing enough to woo one of Kirk's crew into helping him take over the ship. Cumberbatch's Khan is a robot: cold, dry, bereft of the faintest ghost of charisma. Maybe Benny knew he couldn't outdo Ricky, because it doesn't feel like he's even trying. Were this the first ever on-screen appearance of Khan, nobody would remember him.""Into Darkness"" shares its predecessor's penchant for mindless spectacle. Remember how Kirk and Khan used actual strategy in Star Trek II: two tactical geniuses exploiting each other's errors in a deadly game of space chess? Well, forget that! This ain't your daddy's Trek, this is NEW Trek, where conflicts are solved by just running in, guns blazing, and leveling cities! Who wants to watch Kirk struggle to preserve as many lives as possible when we can have a hot Carol Marcus posing in her underwear! Cheap sex appeal and 'splosions! We condemn Michael Bay for making movies like this! Why does J. J. Abrams get a pass!?The story flies apart if you think about it for even one minute (more than the writers did, I'm sure!). Harrison/Khan beams directly to Kronos from light-years away; if transporters can beam you to other planets, why bother with starships? Khan was a super-soldier in TOS, but here he's given outright superpowers: he takes phaser shots head-on and barely flinches, can be beaten savagely by multiple people without apparent injury, and possesses super-blood that can raise the dead. Yes, really, RAISE THE DEAD! PLEASE don't question it!But the greatest insult is the ending: not content to lift only the villain from Star Trek II, the writers lifted THE WHOLE CLIMAX! Remember when Spock sacrificed himself to save the Enterprise? Abrams and crew remade that scene, almost verbatim, but with Kirk as the sacrifice instead of Spock. Ignoring, if you can, that this is blatant plagiarism, it fails on EVERY level. The original scene was heartbreaking because we'd had a whole series AND two movies to explore the friendship of Kirk and Spock, and now here Kirk was helpless to do anything but watch Spock die. If ""Into Darkness"" thinks ripping that off will get me misty-eyed, it's tragically mistaken: you can't convince me that new Kirk and Spock are friends when all they ever do is bicker with each other! Spock's death in ""Wrath of Khan"" tied into the idea of Kirk never having faced a no-win situation. What idea does Kirk's death touch on in ""Into Darkness,"" other than that today's writers can't create new material without plundering yesterday's masterpieces?And that is the rot at the heart of these reboots: they CANNOT stand on their own. The writers lack the talent to create anything compelling, so they slap on a recognizable brand name to trick fans into buying it. ""Abrams' Trek"" is content to reap a profit off the classic series without paying respect to it. It resurrects characters, recycles plots, regurgitates ideas from past Trek without any clue what made them work in the first place. Rather than making something new we could look back on fondly someday, it dooms itself to mediocrity by palely imitating the work of the more talented artists who came before. We will always remember Shatner as Kirk, Montalbán as Khan, and Star Trek II as a masterpiece. ""Into Darkness"" will be forgotten, lost to the dust of time, forever trapped in the shadows of its forerunners. Resistance is futile.",Star Trek Into Darkness
598,playerazzi,"Oh, Brother, Leave it Alone",3,11 November 2013,"The movie starts with Kirk and McCoy violating the Prime Directive. We don't know why, we just know that it is happening. We never find out exactly what they were doing on this primitive planet. And the Enterprise literally underwater? And then flies through the air!? It's a *space*ship, newsflash!And then it goes from bad to worse. Zachary Quinto's Spock is robot- like, and Nimoy's Spock, although certainly ""logical"" was never quite robot-like. He was always a real entity. The original Kirk was someone we could rely on, a rock. This Kirk is a wild card, and he gets wilder. And Scotty resigns his post.

599,matsnowie,"Some old territory, but still a smart sequel",7,5 September 2013,"This is the long-awaited sequel to a blockbuster science fiction franchise that has seen highs and lows over the past few decades. It is probably the best indicator of what JJ Abrams will bring to a Star Wars sequel, and I'd say things are looking very good.After a thrilling James Bond-like opening mission, Kirk and the Enterprise return to Earth. In London, rogue agent John Harrison (Benedict Cumberbatch) has bombed a Starfleet archive, and Kirk gets permission from Admiral Marcus (Peter Weller) to hunt him down.From the opening scenario involving primitive aliens, cliff diving, and exploding volcanoes, the film keeps a pace going that would give the original series whiplash. William Shatner's crew may have had time for philosophy and contemplation, but with Chris Pine on the bridge the philosophy must be discussed between phaser blasts. Action fans can rejoice at this. Sometimes the speed and clutter of the frame was overwhelming, but JJ has proved to be a more than capable action director with a clear hold on his audience.A superficial improvement in the sequel is the reduction of lens flares. It doesn't bother me, but many people complain that the first film has too many. Happy for you then that JJ is such a nice guy because he has bowed to the people's will and given you what you asked for. Giving the audience what they want, however, is exactly what causes trouble in the film. Not a lot of trouble, but enough to make this sequel not quite as good as its predecessor.Where the first film had a streamlined plot that spiralled around it's time-travel premise, Into Darkness has an element of chaos that is both good and bad. As the plot unfolds and the villain surprises Kirk, the chaos plays to the danger and suspense that comes with such an unpredictable opponent. But in gaining mystery and suspense the film sacrifices tidy storytelling, which shuffles emotional scenes and action scenes in jarring ways. As far as criticisms go that one is pretty weak, but it's the best description I can give for the slight disappointment I felt.The writers have picked up the alternate-time line characters where they were left and have followed them forward with the understanding that even on a new time line, they could encounter elements of the original series. At times, references to the original series get in the way of good storytelling. This is a problem that only Trek fans will have to deal with, however, since the film as science fiction, as action, as adventure, and as a fun ensemble is solid. Even if references to the original do get in the way, they are such good elements that it would have been a shame to lose just because Spock Prime (Leonard Nimoy) messed up the time line in the first film.When sequels like The Dark Knight come along they are met with astonishment because good sequels have been so difficult and rare. Before Nolan returned to Gotham there was only The Godfather Part 2 and The Empire Strikes Back to cited as undeniably great successors. Though I won't place Into Darkness in their league, it is still a fantastic sequel. With JJ doing Star Wars it is unlikely we will see another Star Trek for 3-4 years unless a new director is found, but when the next film comes it will have a lot to live up to in both of its predecessors.",Star Trek Into Darkness

The rest of the crew are as should be, great. The movie starts off well an picks up really fast as it goes along just like you expect it.

602,harsh007,"An adrenaline pumping,heart thumping cinematic experience",9,12 May 2013,"You know summer is here when Hollywood blockbusters start raining at the Box Office. This Year the like every year we have a huge arsenal of to- be blockbusters lined up to treat the viewers all over the world. The season started with Iron Man 3 being the frontrunner and now passing on the baton to Star Trek: Into Darkness followed by Man of Steel.This week's movie Star Trek: Into Darkness directed by JJ Abrams (writer of lost, fringe, Armageddon, director of MI: 3,star trek etc.) is a sequel of the reboot of a cult classic adventures of the crew aboard the explorer space ship USS Enterprise. The story is set in a future where humans have explored new life sustaining planets where some species predate human existence and some are relatively new. The USS Enterprise wanders in galaxies to search for life forms and maintains a peace treaty with most of them as the sole motive of the explorations is to maintain peace throughout the universe. The movie begins with an adrenaline pumping ,heart thumping ,jaw dropping action sequence set in the blood red forest of planet 'nibru' where Captain Jim Kirk and his medical officer are being chased down by spear throwing natives, simultaneously Spock is trying to prevent the extinction of the species of the planet by exploding a cold fusion bomb in the erupting volcano thus trying to alter the destiny of the planet for which he gets panned later. Jim Kirk escapes the natives by jumping into the ocean but spock is not so lucky and gets stuck in the erupting volcano with the cold fusion device ready to explode. He is ready to sacrifice his life to save the life of the species by detonating the device but is saved by Jim kirk at the brink of spectacular cold fusion explosion, stopping the volcano from erupting and the species of annihilation; something they were not supposed to do as altering the course of destiny leads to devastating ramifications. Jim gets demoted, spock gets reassigned and THE CINEMATIC EXPERIENCE BEGINS. In the days following the events described above a new terrorist emerges (Khan Noonein Singh) played by the ever charismatic 'Benedict Cumberpatch' who threatens the world by raging a war against its leaders beginning with direct attack on the USS Head Quarters and murdering its leaders in cold blood. Then begins the Man-Hunt for the absconder who has taken refuge in the un-inhabited territories controlled by the Klingons who are the arch enemies of humans. Going to those territories would lead to an all out war between Klingons and humans which would take earth INTO DARKNESS but not bringing the terrorist to justice would raise questions on power the USS itself.Secrets are revealed, relationships are broken and tough choices are made to walk the thin line between good and evil. Thus making it into a racy cinematic experience which maintains its pace throughout the 133 minutes keeping you hooked to your seats all the time. It's a movie nobody should miss irrespective of whether you have seen any of the star trek movies before. Watch it you won't get bored even for a minute.Pros: Spectacular action sequences, good story and well written characters, enthralling background score, Benedict Cumberpatch Cons :Not a very original story",Star Trek Into Darkness
603,MakoMori,Star Trek: Into Darkness,8,21 May 2013,"Film Review: Star Trek: Into Darkness*** CONTAINS MAJOR SPOILERS BELOW SEE THE FILM BEFORE READING*****When J.J. Abrams said he wanted to make a film for not just Star trek lovers, but also a film for regular moviegoers I had no idea what Star Trek would look like. The film opened with elaborate set pieces and some truly stunning action. The camera tracked along with Kirk as he ran through an exotic landscape, trying to escape with his life. The scene continued, cross cutting with other members of the crew up in the enterprise. Ultimately leading to the climax of the scene, where Spock must descend into a volcano to save an entire planet. This film opened by capturing a small moment of action, which seemed to be a normal expedition for the crew of the enterprise. Using this technique was a perfect way to start the film; the action and set pieces immediately captured my attention, while also making me feel as if I was apart of the action. The use of tracking and crosscutting heightened the building tension and enhanced the very well done CGI. Besides being pleasing to the eye, this introduction set the entire tone of the film, Star Trek would be an action packed film with some witty dialogue and great characters. As the high adrenaline introduction continues, Kahn is first introduced. His first screen appearance is purposeful. Kahn is immediately set up as a man who is a terrorist with a lack of conscience, and someone who will stop at noting to achieve his goals. His first few scenes set up his motives and also provide foreshadowing to his abilities and how they will affect the future. Meanwhile the crew of the enterprise is chastised for their latest escapade, Kirk finds himself demoted from captain and forced to second in command. Kirk and Spocks unconventional and brotherly relationship is expanded on as the growing threat of the unknown Kahn continues. When a fire of missiles intrudes a meeting the non-stop action is once again introduced. The decision to create a rouge crew is made and the members of the enterprise are reinstated. The search for Kahn is initiated. The second act of Into Darkness is much like the first; there is a continuation of new lands and obstacles that the crew must face in order to reach Kahn. Abrams relies on this action and witty dialogue to propel the film. At this point it feels as if the film is going into the direction of style over substance. The immersion into new worlds is exciting and the dialogue allows easy laughs, but there is so much action that these scenes, although well done, lose their value as the quantity of action increases. There also is a nod to Starwars when enemy cruisers are pursuing the detached spacecraft. The Klingons are also shortly introduced, becoming part of Kahn's alibi, and fuelling the long-standing tension between their race and the Starfleet. The film takes a nice break from the action as Kahn tells his origins to the crew, continuing to walk the line of misunderstood or evil, manipulating or exposing the truth. When Kirk is pulled into a multitude of options the film starts to pick up pace again. This act was frustrating for me. Although the conflict was outlined I didn't feel as if they explained the character motivations enough. Marcus walked the line of solider of fortune, making him almost a secondary villain, who in my opinion was unnecessary; overall his character seemed out of place. The final act continues with the intense action scenes, as kirk must save the ship from certain doom. The last act has some really great fight scenes and intricate set pieces. The final fight between Spock and Kirk was well done, but the ending left me with a kind of anti-climatic feeling. Because the second act expanded on Kahn's motivations the film had a kind of unfinished feeling. Just as I was discovering who the villain was, he became eliminated. The film ends on a great note as balance is restored and the crew of the enterprise embarks on it's five year mission. I felt that one of the strongest points in this film was it's first act, it was well done setting up the current state of the crew and cross cutting with the Kahn. It reminded me of The Dark Knight, introducing the audience to the villain, while catching up with the protagonist. The actors are also a strong point; the casting is what really brings the film together. The chemistry of the actors works to form truly entertaining dialogue. I felt that Kahn was also very well done as he could have been made into a one note villain, as I mentioned earlier I wish Abrams would have just stuck to him as the sole conflict for the film. The cinematography was excellent, seeing the film in IMAX was a really amazing and immersing; Into Darkness has esthetically been the best IMAX film since Prometheus. Overall I recommend Star Trek: Into Darkness as a great action film with fantastic dialogue and characters. For someone born and raised of the classic Starwars trilogy I cannot speak about the origins or authenticity (I have no knowledge whatsoever) of this Star Trek adaptation. But as a film goer I can easily say this movie was very entertaining and enjoyable. *** Sorry this review is not like usual; I drank one to many mojitos before and found myself distracted for the first 3o minutes. I have also heard some complaints from fans of the series, so sorry I couldn't weigh in on that, I hope J.J. Abrams did justice to Star Trek.",Star Trek Into Darkness
604,Extraneus92,I'm a Cumberbitch now,4,22 January 2014,"I watched this for the first time last night. It must be made clear from the offset that this review is not written by a Star Trek fan. I'm very indifferent to the franchise. For this reason my review is simply about the film and nothing more.On a level this film was competent, the general level of acting was solid, the effects great and when the action was going on it was engaging and entertaining. Though, what this film failed spectacularly at was any kind of deepness at the plot level. From the word 'go' we are thrust into a situation in a Bondesque manner. Star Trek Into Darkness loads us into a situation of great magnitude, yet for such a situation there is little peril as we know the fates of the characters from endless trailers and general common sense. The introduction fails to grip but there are all manner ramifications.Perhaps the major downfall of this film is the sheer copycat that it becomes to the first film of this series. It is of a near identical framework until BAM, the plot moves forward. We have gone from the ramifications of the original 'mission' into a massive centre plot in a matter of seconds. We are not introduced to the character of Harrison, we are not introduced to his cause nor the environment surrounding the moment of action. What has happened is that Benedict Cumberbatch has turned up and all of a sudden there is an evil presence in the picturesque landscape of London. I didn't appreciate this. I felt that I was being thrust forward from my seat unwillingly. With no reasoning what-so-ever all of the bosses of starfleet meet up in one room... After an attack on one of their bases where it is made clear that starfleet is the target. Suddenly cue Chris Pine's thoughtful moment and realisation and BAM another attack. This has been done so many times it was highly unoriginal. In fact for the most part there was nothing novel about this film.This film tries to keep you second guessing, though fails spectacularly at that too, anyone thoughtful enough can see through the peril that befalls them. The plot is thrown at you rather than eased into your mind. This is like somebody screaming derivatives at you until you're ready to punch them. Of course the twist is see-through even to a non-trekky. I spent the entire film wanting Benedict Cumberbatch to win. Indeed, Cumberbatch steals the show on a magnificent level, he is simply in his element playing a character such as Harrison and his performance is one that the actor can be incredibly proud of. I slowly became a Cumberbitch. His performance is one of the good things about this film, and like I suggested above there are positives to this work. However, these are outweighed by the negatives. I felt like this could've been a good film, a very good film; if it was it may have led this series on to becoming a great. Though, this feels rushed, it feels unoriginal and apart from some good work from the actors and behind the scenes experts it seriously falls short of the modern expectation of a solid film. Back to the drawing board I think.",Star Trek Into Darkness
605,platomd,An intricate plot with many twists,8,20 May 2013,"Star Trek into the Darkness moves where no Star Trek movie has gone before. A blend of science fiction, drama, adventure and an emerging love story combines these elements to create a product that should be seen by anyone caught up in Star Trek Mania. Since 1965 when the pilot of the original show was produced, this fast paced sci-fi show has captured the imaginations of tens of millions. Into the Darkness' fast paced adventure sequences tops all prior productions. Action sequences over its 2 hours and 3 minutes running time are paced so quickly that one has trouble keeping up with storyline. To discuss the extensive plot would giveaway the core meaning of the movie. No one who favors this franchise will be disappointed by its content or outcome. I rated 8 out of 10 because of a few clichéd parts, otherwise it was an excellent production. I plan to return with my family to view it again.

606,gtw-168-105516,"Am I just getting old, or what?",5,11 May 2013,"When someone asks me, how was Star Trek? My first inclination is to say it was loud and bright. It seems to me that it has become standard practice to cut the intelligence out of movies that try to have some sort of action/drama synergy and add more action. Its like the writers are sitting around the table saying, ""How can we make this cooler."" Living in Asia, I can tell you that that philosophy has really worked for bringing in the East Asian audience- they really like the big flash, bang bang, coolness of things. You see it walking down the street every day, so its not surprising that Hollywood panders to them. Its also not surprising that it panders to adolescents, they have the most disposable income. It is surprising however, that reviewers that apparently aren't Chinese and clearly aren't adolescent would describe this movie (and others like it) as the greatest thing since popcorn. Putting all that aside, there were parts of this movie that were good, others that just didn't make sense, and more that left me saying, ""Why the f*ck is this happening."" The interesting parts of this movie were apparently not important enough to become the focus off the story. I think if they had focused on the impending conflict between the Federation and the Klingons it would have been an easy way to make it interesting, but that's just one option. Another thing, they really sell Kirk as a bad captain. Twenty minutes into this film i thought, wow you really are a sh*t captain. Then there is Spock. Apparently being more human and playing to your emotions rather than your brain is the ultimate Good. What's a brain for anyway. SO anyway, rant over, maybe this movie could be a six, but no, its not its a five, so suck it.",Star Trek Into Darkness

This might be no new from this genre, but there's something about the story, the characters, even the effects that will blow your mind. Hats off for JJ Abrams to bring this coolness to the theater. And for the actors I really admire how well they dig into the characters and I praise Bennedict that plays pretty good in this movie and all the rest of the cast. and for the script it is well written and somehow I am really imagine how our grand grandkids would live those day ... it is capture well beyond my imagination and it's make me think. I always love movies that push me to think ""it might be"" and ""what should I do"". But this review is nonsense without you being watch the movie by yourself.

608,xenoraiser,Exciting. Offers a Lot for Both New and Old Fans,9,15 May 2013,"www.recaphub.comIf you had told me four years ago that I'd be anticipating a Star Trek release more than anything, I'd tell you to check yourself into a mental ward. But J.J. Abrams and company produced a fresh, exciting experience with the 2009 reboot. Somehow Star Trek became synonymous with a hip and cool crowd. Now with the sequel, we've been teased by a number of things, including footage of a heavily damaged ship crashing into Earth, a chase sequence amidst futuristic skyscrapers, and the promise of a devilishly menacing villain (Benedict Cumberbatch). And the best part? That's just the start of what I have to praise about this superior sequel.The trailers for Into Darkness have done a great job at showing footage without giving any major plot points away. Ultimately all you need to know can be inferred from these previews: Benedict Cumberbatch is up to some stuff that's going to make things VERY tense for our heroes. After a fun-filled opening to get us reacquainted with the Enterprise, the movie takes quite a few serious turns to keep us on our toes. As a non-Trekkie, I'll be the first to say that there are points which will lose the more oblivious viewers. For those who are even casually versed, however, there's a fair amount of fan service to be enjoyed. Really the core plot brings in more Trekkie lore than anything, while the story itself deals with the strengths and pitfalls of our main characters. But don't worry, we're still given plenty of punchy comic relief--thanks to a glorious screenplay--and some especially enthralling action. One particular sequence had me gaping in sheer awe as the exact words ""I'm seeing this again in IMAX!"" plopped right into my head (I saw a regular 3D showing). It's not just the bright, detailed and colorful visuals that drive these scenes, but also the crisp, hard-hitting audio. Into Darkness is a film you watch with the best possible set-up, all thanks to an escalating sense of urgency. To put it in perspective, think of a new, futuristic and sci-fi way of watching the Titanic sink.Even more reason the danger grips so hard is because we honestly feel for the characters. Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto might have young faces, but they quickly convince you that they're beyond their appearances. Both are all over the emotional board, never skipping a beat for neither deliveries nor expressions. Then there's Benedict Cumberbatch, whose identity is best left unveiled in the film itself. It's as if all the problems with Eric Bana as Nero were taken and used as reinforcement for this new adversary. There's a combination of wit and bluntness to each of his typically threatening lines, lending command and immediacy to every scene he's in.About all that slows Star Trek Into Darkness down is the aforementioned possibility of losing certain audience members, along with an anti-climactic ending. One moment the film is still running in the high gears and the next it's down to an idle park. That said, there's so much fun, excitement and edginess that most people will happily set the smaller issues aside. You're not going to get a better, more crowd-pleasing popcorn film than this for the rest of the year.",Star Trek Into Darkness
609,david-497-331474,Spectacular...but too many storyline inconsistencies,8,5 October 2013,"I've been a serious ""trekkie"" since the original series was aired here in the UK in 1969. I was somewhat disappointed with this, the latest offering.On the plus side, the film is visually stunning, with some absolutely amazing CGI. The pace is fast and doesn't suffer from any long pauses in the action. There are plenty of shocks and memorable moments.My main objection lies with the inconsistencies with subsequent Trek story lines which I cannot go into without revealing the plot details, suffice it to say that there is a serious mismatch between this and what happens later in the Trek story.Also, one scene matched both the action (although there was role reversal in this film) and even the exact dialogue from an earlier Trek film. I saw no reason for this, something more original could have been written, plus the outcome of the scene was, frankly just silly I thought. There were other scenes that in some ways harked back to earlier films, Perhaps I'm being too purist about this - maybe. Nevertheless, I did mostly enjoy it even though to me it lacked any real emotional impact compared to its predecessors, nothing that made me want to watch it again.If you view it without reference to other Trek story lines, I think you will find it quite an entertaining 2 hours!",Star Trek Into Darkness
610,Mandeth,Star Trek II The Not So Wrath Of CumberKhan,1,7 May 2013,"The 2009 Star Trek film by J.J. Abrams was a mix of 80's films like Police Academy and Gene Roddenberry's Star Trek. Gone was the intellect. Replaced by a Kirk played by Chris Pine who was ripped from Steve Guttenberg's Officer Mahoney of the Police Academy movies. A Zach Quinto Spock that seemed like a comical parody of the original one of the most miscast casts ever in film. Abrams' Trek crew wasn't smart enough to pilot a canoe but they were all thrown into his version of the Enterprise, so we could have some fun teen hi-jinks in Star Trek meets American Pie. Unfortunately the dumbed down Porky's Trek made some money. So we get a sequel; 'Star Trek Into Darkness'. This film's buildup has been totally centered around the I.D. of the villain. Of course that secret may or may not be a secret but finding that out adds no enjoyment here. And the big reveal is that Abrams did indeed attempt to recreate Khan. This Khan is not the handsome, deadly, strategist played so well by Ricardo Montalban. Instead he is a whimsical, crying, effeminate, boring Khan played oh not so well by Benedict Cumberbatch. So I'll call him...CumberKhan. And he's not a strategist of any kind. In fact he wouldn't even make a good terrorist in the real world but in Abrams dumb world of Mahoney- Kirk, he is quite deadly. CumberKhan wants to attack Starfleet command. His genius and diabolical plan: Mass shooting! Yeah. That's right. A big Sci Fi, big movie villain is reduced to being a mass-shooter. And so he goes all mass shooter and shoots up a command meeting. His mass shooting is cut short by Mahoney-Kirk and CumberKhan escapes. But not before CumberKhan's mass shooting fatally wounds Mahoney-Kirk's mentor Admiral Pike, thus creating some vague implication of a rivalry between them. So Mahoney-Kirk and the rest of the miscast Trek parody crew take off looking for CumberKhan. Once they find and capture him, they find a gentle, crying and motherly CumberKhan. CumberKhan is only doing bad things because Starfleet's Admiral Marcus, played by Peter Weller, has his crew from 300 years ago captive in their cryogenic pods. And CumberKhan wants them back. So CumberKhan isn't a villain really. He's more like the poor misunderstood Abominable Snowman in the old classic Rudolph The Red Nosed Reindeer. He's just a misfit. Admiral Marcus is the real villain who had CumberKhan's crew loaded into torpedoes onto the Enterprise with a 'do not open' order with instructions to use them to kill CumberKhan. Once that's settled, Marcus shows up in the USS Vengeance. He wants CumberKhan, Mahoney-Kirk wants to keep Cumber-Khan and go to Earth to rat out Marcus so we get a big battle. Both ships are damaged. Mahoney- Kirk and CumberKhan literally jump from the Enterprise to the USS Vengeance, Marcus gets killed and CumberKhan decides to betray Mahoney- Kirk and turns the USS Vengeance on the Enterprise and demands his crew be returned. We get another brief battle that leaves the Enterprise damaged. USS Vengeance crashes to the Earth and San Francisco, CumberKhan of course survives and runs off into the city. We get a bizarre Abrams Police Academy style version of Trek II's classic death of Spock scene, Only this time it's Mahoney-Kirk who dies while Parody-Spock watches. And this time none of it matters as it did in Trek II since these characters do not matter. Mahoney-Kirk's death is shortlived,(LOL!)when he's resurrected after Dr. Parody-McCoy takes some of CumberKhan's blood and injects it into a dead tribble. I guess injecting dead tribbles with liquids is fun in the 23rd century. Then when Parody-McCoy sees CumberKhan's blood can revive the dead, he has Parody-Spock chase down CumberKhan, get some more blood and voila; Mahoney-Kirk is back. By the way this is the same he's dead now he's alive Hollywood stunt usually reserved for the end of bad movies or TV shows to inject some form of impact and meaning when the actual ending has none. It's an old Hollywood trick developed and used in TV and films like Gilligan's Island and Short Circuit. And the trick is once again deployed here by the overrated Abrams to make people think they saw something relevant. Actually it was done better on Gilligan's Island. The Skipper, Professor, the Howell's, Ginger and Mary Ann standing and mourning the Skipper's apparently dead 'Little Buddy' when he falls out of a tree and lands on the Skipper's head. Hmm. Maybe if Kirk had fallen out of a tree on...nah. Wouldn't work because who cares about Abrams and Chris Pine's Mahoney-Kirk. I suppose this film was called 'Into Darkness' because of Mahoney-Kirk's brief death. Whatever the reason, this film further signifies the end of the true thought invoking and socially relevant Star Trek.",Star Trek Into Darkness
611,chaostheory6682,Lackluster Film,1,12 May 2014,"Very little about this movie works. Things are out of order, they disregarded decades of Star Trek lore, and for some reason distances don't mean anything.There is a part in the movie where they go from the Neutral Zone to earth in the space of one 2 minute continuous scene. There are moments like this all over the place. It really messes with the pacing of the film and makes it unrealistic and muddy.Honestly, the entire story is just a mess. It chaotically goes back and forth between shaky action scenes, corny attempts at humor, bits of story--apparently added for good measure--and the occasional mushy stuff put in there as garnish.Plus, they really crapped on Star Trek mythos with the whole reverse Kirk/Spock thing. Totally disgusting disregard for the original films. J.J Abrams has no business making these movies, he's not a fan and he doesn't respect the franchise.It is constantly in conflict with older canon, such as having trans-warp technology and weapons, which weren't developed for another 100 years, after we encountered the Borg.For a Star Trek film it is a very violent movie.The special effects are alright, but don't expect any realism, even at times where it would improve the scene if they took the time to do it right; everything is very over the top--another example of Hollywood deciding physics don't matter. Which I am getting tired of seeing--But what did I expect from a J.J Abrams film?Personally, I can't set through the whole movie without getting bored and finding something else to half-occupy my mind when watching it. I suppose I will have to wait until someone comes along that actually cares about Star Trek, and makes them right, before I will get any movies I will enjoy.And I did try to like the new films, I really did, but it's like they were made for meth addicts with the attention span of a Mealworm. Until then, I suppose will have to stick to the shows and older movies to get my fix.",Star Trek Into Darkness
612,atoothbrush,Poor follow up to the reboot,2,3 January 2016,"What to say about this movie. I actually admire the direct attempt to remake what is considered the best trek movie. The combination of 'superior in all aspects but arrogant' genetically engineered augments combined the the 'irrationally vengeful villain' was an amazing concept the resonated with audiences on both superficial and deeper levels.Some of the previous TNG movies have, in part, tapped into these ideas. Most notably Nemesis which had both a superior enemy ship an arrogant villain. Sadly, this movie failed to follow through on this winner of a premise. Nostalgia quotes and references quickly wore thin in st2009, in this film they are gratingly obvious crutches in place of a compelling story, characters and emotion between the action. The essence of classic trek is the focus on a humanistic theme. This and st2009 are cheap, popcorn action flicks trading on the beloved franchise in name only.In short; it's more of the same 2009 reboot - loud, fast and dumb and trek in name alone.",Star Trek Into Darkness
613,wolverinex2002,"Wait, what???8,1 out of 10?yeah right!!",6,22 July 2013,"ATTENTION: SPOILERS!I was really disappointed with the execution of this film, so i decided to lay down the reasons why:The trailer prepares you for something epic, but the actual film is not that epic at all. Major events happen(cities destroyed, Klingon war is on the verge), but only USS enterprise is there, so not so much epicness here. The director focuses on showing off the 3D capabilities, without giving attention to character development and motives. Major characters just appear on screen (especially Bones), shouting their usual tag lines, and then leave the screen. Khan easily guns down the Starfleet Commanding offices without any defense to stand against him.OK, maybe he had agreed the whole thing with the admiral, but then why went into all that trouble to save the young girl from the secret office clerk? he had an alliance with the Head of the Starfleet for god's shake. And why the NCC-1701 is deep down in the ocean, on the Nibiru mission? Isn't the fleet vessels usually in orbit?don' tell me, I already know the answer, just to show off the graphic capabilities.As a result, we are denied the famous 5-year mission, the voyage, the exploration, all that is the true spirit of Star Trek(why do it in the 2nd installment, when you can delay it, like the Lost series). Instead we get a revenge scenario. OK, excuse me here, but since the film decided to go that way, it clashes with ""Wrath of Khan"" and loses. The director had a chance to really blow us off by killing the captain for the shake of his crew, but decided not to. For every one who may disagree with this point, what if the film ended with a bar sequence where a young cadet is impaled through the heart?The timeline has been already distorted, so there is no reason why not.Anyway, just to be clear with this, i loved Star Trek: the future begins!!it had a far more complex scenario, but still maintained a great balance between action sequences and character interaction.Overall, this is a nice action sci-fi film that appeals to the masses (ticket sales is proof of this), but it is without a Star Trek heart in it.PS: I haven't read any related forums, so maybe some of my questions have been already answered, but i do not want to read forums to understand films.",Star Trek Into Darkness

I loved the references to Space Seed!! The scene where Kirk was dying made me almost cry! The fighting between Khan and Spock was amusing. I love the humor from Scotty. I was in the edge of my seat the whole entire time. Seeing the Klingons on the big screen in 3D was a cool experience!! Was it better than Iron Man 3, yes. The scene where Spock was in the volcano was intense and suspenseful! I really loved the planet Kronos!! When Kirk and Khan worked together, I was like ''this is pretty epic!!''. The whole cast was amazing and awesome!! I am really looking forward to the third movie and what J. J. Abrams has in store for us!!

615,yagian,"Do What You Feels Right, When You Have No Idea What I Should Do",7,10 September 2013,"After work, I went to see ""Star Trek Into Darkness."" It is a very interesting movie, I think.Compared with ""Man of Steel,"" the visual effect of this movie looks cheaper, although that of ""Man of Steel"" is outstanding.Actually, the biggest appeal of ""Star Trek Into Darkness"" isn't visuals but dialogs between characters, especially Kirk and Spock. When I read the quotes of it, I found that the script was really well written.Since I became a middle manager of my company, I have been thinking about management and leadership for two years. ""Star Trek"" series are very helpful for it.Spock is always quite logical and clear, so he is an extremely capable manager. Then, why is Kirk a captain of the USS Enterprise?The answer is that management and leadership aren't different. Spock is the best manager, but he isn't good enough for a leader, and Kirk is inferior to Spock as a manager, but he is the leader of the USS Enterprise.I think that the most important roles of leaders are motivating people and making a decision.Motivation of human beings isn't necessary logical. Sometimes emotional sympathy moves people more than reasonable explanation. It is important for leaders to express what they feel. Spock isn't good at expressing emotion at all. Although Kirk is too emotional as a manager, it is one of the most important qualities of a leader.Leaders have to make a decision, even when they don't have any idea what they should do logically. Such a decision is often critical. Spock can point out only what shouldn't do, but he can't decide what really they will do. Kirk is sometimes thoughtless and makes a mistake, but he can make such a difficult and critical decision.I'd like to show a typical dialog between Spock and Kirk.===========Spock: Captain, I cannot allow you to do this! Bones: Jim, you're not actually going after this guy, are you? James T. Kirk: I have no idea what I'm supposed to do! I only know what I CAN do! ===========Spock warned Kirk that his idea was too dangerous, but he couldn't show what they should do. On the other hand, Kirk decided to do what he could do.Spock is appropriate for the lieutenant of the USS Enterprise and Kirk is appropriate for the captain.Do what I feels right, when I have no idea what I should do.",Star Trek Into Darkness
616,deimos47ca,"Glitzy, fancy, unoriginal, pompous",6,22 May 2013,"ST:ID is NOT a SCI-FI movie. Its a popcorn action movie. This is incredibly difficult to understand because Abbrams took a franchise known for being allegory to our society (racism, communism, democracy), full of lessons on morals and self discovery, and turned it into ""die hard in space"". It is exactly what Star Wars EP1 was for the old series.This is a completely different movie than what you probably expect or saw in trailers. I honestly don't know why I'm giving a 6 and not lower:* Hundreds of scenes have distracting over bright effect - very distracting when trying to pay attention to dialogue.* Nothing special about dialogue or characters... unlike the old movies, you do not get a sense the crew are all comrades who have been through a lot.* ADD sufferers you're in luck - most of the scenes are so jam packed with dozens of extras and shiny machinery, its difficult to tell what's going on. * Cowboys. Not the future. Movie is full of tech contradictions. You got phasers and teleporters but can't use them - instead lots of running and punching. Its all strange and out of place.* Star Fleet is the Navy? Forgetting for a moment how absurd it is that the WHOLE crew is 20 yr olds. Even today's armed forces don't sent out warships with 70 cruise missiles to kill a terrorist.. not even for Bid Laden. * The movie is completely unoriginal. Its famous scenes from movies 1-5 in a blender. I would not have been surprised if whales showed up. If you like a movie that repeats dialogue from older movies than all the power to you.In conclusion, ST:ID is out of place today or any day. Should have made a completely new franchise - something along lines of DS9. This special effects extravaganza completely lacks any sci-fi, philosophy and crew comradery the franchise is known for.

The legions of die-hard fans inspired me to give this saga a try.After, seeing this movie I instead wondered what was so great about it.Then I read the 1-star reviews and realized that this movie actually doesn't encapsulate anything that made the original great.Wish someone would do a true reboot which is honest to its original roots.Sadly Disappointing!",Star Trek Into Darkness

I have been a big Trek fan since I was about 10 when the original series went into syndication, I am now 53. The first movie(09) was disappointing when the timeline was changed as I am a real stickler for Trek history. This iteration of the next movie in the franchise made up for the first movie. JJ Abrams and the other writers included homage to the original series without being too overt. We get to see more interaction and the basis of the friendship between Kirk and Spock, we learn more about Uhura and Spock's relationship, we get to see Uhura as an woman of action and we get to see a new incarnation of a villain. I really liked this movie and hope any others in the future will be just as good.",Star Trek Into Darkness
619,derwunderbaremandarin,Impressively unimpressive,1,11 May 2013,"This is not a good movie, and here are the reasons why: 1. It seems that showing fast action sequences in 3D was the main purpose of the movie, not storytelling. The movie is loaded with action while the storytelling is poor. 2. You need to know the characters from the first reboot movie or the classic Star Trek movies. If you don't, you are lost. The storytelling is so neglected that you hardly will identify with or care for any of the characters in the movie. 3. There is too much action - impressive action, yes, but action. After the third action scene, it gets OTT. The action has to get more and more spectacular to impress. And it's so damn repetitive that it tends to get boring - and in the end, it leaves you indifferent. 4. The dramaturgy is really bad. While the interesting core of the story is well put, there are way too many twists during the last 30 minutes - to justify even more action scenes I suppose. They're totally unnecessary (as much as all the action) and wreck whatever good could have been said about the movie. 5. The story itself is deficient, maybe also due to the dramaturgy that raped the story with all its twists - hard to tell what came first. Anyway, the movie comes with a huge packing of action-crying-action- crying. Hard men fight, one minute later they cry for each other, then the next attack comes, then more crying. It's quite ridiculous and very cheesy. 6. The movie looks like plastic. The classic Star Trek movies had a certain weight, a dark touch to them. This one is called ""Into darkness"" but looks like bubble gum, with a captain who makes you think of Barbie's Ken rather than of James T. Kirk. Conclusion: too much of everything, especially repetitive action, poor storytelling, a basically good core-story wrapped in too much slay-cry- slay-cry. Trekkies won't like that movie, people with no clue about Star Trek won't either. I'm not a Trekkie, and I know the classic Start Trek movies. Still, I found this effort impressively unimpressive.",Star Trek Into Darkness
620,Headrock,"Average 2000's action flick, hurt further by the shameless milking.",6,15 September 2013,"I've been trying to write a short review about this movie, but I just can't - below is simply the shortest version I could be satisfied with. There's just too much I want to say, because I honestly thought that ""Star Trek Into Darkness"" would be the breaking-out film that would re-ignite this new franchise after ""Star Trek 2009"" failed so miserably. I vaguely recall hearing that notion from a few people who had watched it, so I figured that despite ""Star Trek 2009""'s complete failure to impress me, I'd still give the series another shot. Unfortunately what I got was mostly just ""Star Trek 2013"" - like the first movie, a good action piece that is heavily marred by constantly trying to remind us that it is a new-and-improved Star Trek and that we should all be really impressed.To explain what I mean, I'll repeat for this movie the same assertion that I made about ""Star Trek 2009"": it's a decent sci-fi action flick which has no real connection to the Star Trek franchise whatsoever, except by constantly dropping references to Star Trek memes and reusing elements from that franchise. In other words: The filmmakers could've started a new universe, made up new characters to go with their new actors and new style, and neither movie (2009 nor Into Darkness) would've suffered. In fact I argue that they both would've been improved, since there would be more run-time to invest in actually making the protagonists sympathetic, the villains interesting (I'm looking at you, Nero), and the plots both interesting and sensical.Instead, J.J.Abrams and crew are putting gigantic amounts of effort into convincing us - today's viewers, whether Trekkie or otherwise - to believe that this films series is a part of the Star Trek franchise. They're essentially milking the remains of that (admittedly dead) franchise without embracing it - a form of cinema necromancy. Cinecromancy! Trying to start a new franchise is risky, of course, and why would you try it if you can just transplant an entire existing, devout fanbase into your new project? It's financially sound - you get a lot of people in theatres for almost no effort - but unfortunately does not make for quality entertainment. You sit there in the theatre for two hours wondering why they keep telling you it's Star Trek. And what's worse, as these movies show, you need gigantic amounts of effort to keep up that pretense! So yes, as an action movie and light-hearted sci-fi I believe ""Star Trek Into Darkness"" is a reasonably-good movie, and you can rest assured that J.J.Abrams knows his stuff when it comes to epic-looking action sequences (though, after 20 years of watching Hollywood action movies, particularly in the last decade, this stuff is starting to look pretty old to me). On the other hand, that heavy-handed attempt to cram as much ""Star Trek"" into this movie as possible alongside the action sequences means that everything else suffers: The plot is flimsy, simple, and expectable; The characters draw very little sympathy - and you're expected to sympathize heavily with them for most of the non-action scenes to work at all; Once again we get a villain who's reported to have some qualities which are never shown (Khan is a genius superhuman? He's certainly a combat machine, but his plan and behavior indicate nothing about any extra smarts); And once again Starfleet seems to be running on the mentality that crewing its flagship with emotionally-stunted, hormone-driven, immature young officers is the way to go - and only luck gets them out of it alive.(Amusingly that last point is actually commented on by the movie itself, but that only serves to make it more obvious as you sit there trying to ignore it.)The bottom line, again, is the same for this movie as it was for Star Trek 2009: If they hadn't tried to force this to be a Star Trek movie, they might've had the time and effort to make a decent film. Instead we got two decent action flicks that have little to do with Star Trek but waste energy trying to convince us that they do - giving both of them the air of shameless capitalization that I personally do not want to smell in the theatre for two hours straight.",Star Trek Into Darkness

622,Leafman,The entire franchise is now in 'Darkness',1,16 May 2013,"Since it has now become (dilithium) crystal clear that J.J. Abrams and his team of writers have COMPLETELY dismantled the entire Trek universe we once knew -- the one that was built so meticulously by Gene Roddenberry (and later, Harve Bennett and Nick Meyer too) -- we must now embrace a Trek product that will likely insult and disgust most purists, plus any ticket buyer who wants something more than a movie enjoyed by ADHD attention spans.This ""Into Darkness"" film continues where the 2009 effort left off, and with much the same approach, but the decibel level is harder on the eardrums this time: more explosions, more stunts, more fisty-cuffs, more chases (both in space and Terra Firma), more phaser shots and more temper tantrums from Kirk and Spock both.I could rhetorically say something like, ""WTF? Why is this STAR TREK? WHY!?!?!?"" and then launch into a heated Trek-purist diatribe attacking the intellectually-challenged, comic book-level screenplay penned by Orci, Kurtzman and Lindelof. But instead, let us try to examine the movie as a space-bound rip-off of the ""Die Hard"" franchise, which obviously are the terms on which the film hopes to succeed.The film's plot presents a saturnine, black-overcoated menace named John Harrison (played woodenly by Benedict Cumberpatch), who starts blowing up buildings in London, then shooting at a roomful of Starfleet's top brass during a staff meeting. He then escapes to the Klingon homeworld to hide out, and will presumably resume his mysterious rampage against the Federation later.But not if James T. Kirk can help it. Even if it means starting a war with the Klingons, our risk-taking Captain gets the green light from Admiral Marcus (Peter Weller) to warp the Enterprise over to Kronos, armed with some secret missiles and an undercover mission imperative. As Kirk tells his crew over the intercom, ""Let's go get the son of a bitch.""Such a standardized, by-the-numbers action yarn has succeeded in efforts produced by the Jerry Bruckheimer stable, for example, or even the second ""Aliens"" movie. But here, the film feels so overstuffed with chases, phaser beams and mortal combat, it's much like the second Indiana Jones movie from 1984; after a while, we become numb to the ""excitement"" and viewing this movie is like riding a roller coaster that simply won't stop, even long after the rider has had enough ""thrills.""****SPOILERS START HERE ------ Further ruining the film is the decision by Orci and Kurtzman to ""unmask"" John Harrison as Khan, the genetically-engineered super-baddie from the original Trek that the late, great Ricardo Montalban elevated to legendary Trek status. By forcibly shoving Khan into the ""Into Darkness"" storyline, the writers seemed almost desperate to include a familiar face as a crowd pleaser, but I found this ""unmasking"" about as convincing as a cheesy moment in a daytime soap opera, and it is essentially where I gave up on the film (about when the third act began).From there, the movie worsened (for me) because soon after, we are then supposed to shed tears for our gallant Captain Kirk sacrificing himself in the Enterprise's warp core chamber to save his ship and crew. Orci and Kurtzman try to duplicate the same touching moment from the ""The Wrath of Khan"" (when Spock dies) by practically duplicating some of the dialogue from that 1982 film. They are reminding us that they know their Star Trek, but I found this moment to be gimmicky and as such, it registered a complete emotional zero.Spock himself, as written by Orci and Kurtzman, also seems little more than a gimmick in these films now, especially at the film's climax, which uses our ever-logical Vulcan as a John Rambo wannabe, as he mercilessly pounds his fists into Khan's face, all in the name of revenge for the loss of his pal Jim Kirk. Much of the movie portrays Spock in the same simplistic manner, and his point-counterpoint interaction with the all-more human Kirk has none of the old magic that Shatner and Nimoy once provided so effortlessly.As I said earlier, forget the fact that this movie is a horrifying abomination for Star Trek purists. Instead, just consider the fact that we have a new franchise, one where you check your brain at the door, don't concern yourself with characterization, and just ignore the words, ""to boldly go where no one has gone before."" (those words were spoken by Chris Pine at the fadeout, and hearing them after watching THIS film was a moment of bitter irony for me, I might add)I wish J.J. Abrams would stick to the new ""Star Wars"" films and leave it at that.",Star Trek Into Darkness
623,MikaHaeli8,Fantastic addition to the franchise,8,9 May 2013,"First of all, this is a direct sequel to ""Star Trek XI""; it sounds like I'm stating the obvious, but I mean in tone and execution as well as the more obvious aspects. However, ""Into Darkness"" seems to have a bit more substance to it, albeit without sacrificing everything that made the first one so fun and easy to engage with, especially in the first half-hour or so, with certain questions being raised over the decisions regarding the appropriate actions to take by individuals. The repercussions of those decisions are executed to devastating effect in the last two acts of the film, with a few surprises here and there.The characters are also pleasingly fleshed out. Whilst the principal cast have already been established in the last film, every single one of them is once more given room to grow and their moment to shine, the moments in question never feeling pointless regarding the plot. The newer additions also add new shades and colour to the palette of the crew, particularly Alice Eve, who just about manages to hold her ground against the mêlée of the events occurring in the film. Just.Of course, Benedict Cumberbatch managed to exceed expectations I didn't even realise I had. Despite my thinking that the choice of his character was a bit of a cop-out, so to speak, he made for a much more memorable and fleshed-out villain than Eric Bana's Nero. Despite the transparency of his true identity, he still managed to surprise me in many ways, not least the degree to which I empathised with his character in the second act.Regarding the aesthetics of the film: first of all, as much as I liked their use in the last film, there are much fewer lens flares used here, thank goodness. This is perhaps because of the 3D and I must say that as someone who has been dissuaded from 3D showings thanks to the poor utilisation of the tool, I was very impressed with its use here. The space scenes in particular look absolutely gorgeous and you also get things flying out at you, so there's something for everyone here; no cine-cardboard cutout rush-job here (looking at you, Clash of the Titans 2010). It's absolutely worth it if you are willing to fork out the extra coupe of pounds/ dollars, so I was highly relieved by that. Michael Giacchino's score is also worth a mention - the usual themes are retained, but with added dissonance in some parts and allegro in others, although this often resulted in it swerving close to unevenness; jarring in comparison to the fluidity of the film.One other complaint that I have was the use of one particular line. It felt incredibly shoehorned in and completely undermined the scene preceding it, although thankfully it was not lingered on for long. That was, perhaps, the one thing I thought was completely unnecessary to the film and when I say 'completely unnecessary', I mean 'sticks out like a sore thumb'. Another problem I had, albeit a little more minor, was that the whole affair was wrapped up too quickly after a certain point, perhaps to the point of dissatisfaction. I would perhaps have liked to have seen a little more of it; maybe there was a scene that was eventually cut from the film. Perhaps not, but it slightly annoyed me.In summary, whilst it wasn't perfect, it was the best sequel to my favourite film I could have possibly hoped for. Everyone involved has my gratitude for making the four-year wait - and the last five months, in which I was engaged in a total lock-down - worth it. I must admit, part of me was expecting a spaceship-wreck of a film. Thankfully, that was not what I got.",Star Trek Into Darkness

The characters are interesting and delightful in their individual ways, and I find that each lends a different color into the story. And the soundtrack! I watched this on DVD, using an average 7.1 setup, and at one point I suddenly realize that I was so immersed in the visual and aural feasts that I was never once jarred out by the use of sound effects. In some other movies, they add those same, artificial heavy thumps repeatedly to give the impression they are action movies. Not this movie. Here the effects are used only at the right time and with the right characteristics within the context.

My reaction was the complete opposite this time around. Into Darkness surpasses its predecessor by leaps and bounds. This is a movie that should appeal as much to most Trekkies as it will to general audiences just looking for a cinematic thrill ride.JJ Abram's inaugural foray into this franchise kind of seemed to leave loyal fans in the dust in the rush to attract a wider demographic. Even before Abrams, I'm pretty sure there were complaints that Trek movies had become too much about space battles and the like and had gotten away from going boldly where no one has gone before. I feel like the writers of Into Darkness must have taken some of those criticisms to heart and set out to address them in what I think is a fairly clever way.The people behind this film got to have their cake and eat it too: they made the most action-packed Star Trek movie ever, but at the end of the day, it's also a reaffirmation of the core ideals of Star Trek and is a lot more reverential to the canon. Having said that, however, the question still remains whether it's possible to craft a movie that is actually about seeking out new life and new civilizations rather than simply paying lip service to that concept.Of course, not all Trekkies will agree with my assessment, but it's impossible to please everyone and fanboys are notoriously difficult to please.

Non-stop action from start to finish and a true popcorn film with a great story. Once again, the acting is right on. I am more of a fan of this starship enterprise than any incarnations prior. My only complaint would be the villain. I was hoping for more of a name to be playing this part and just wasn't convinced he was the ultimate villain but by performance, not the writing. Perhaps if they would've acquired a more infamous villainy actor to portray ""John Harrison"" than I would've been completely sold.

Combat scenes were uninspired at best and the shaky camera work doesn't make the combat look more dynamic or exciting, it actually really bugged me, like it does in every other action scene recently. Shaking the lens off your camera is no excuse for bad fight choreography. There were several plot ""oversights"" I will not mention, but what really got me was the scene where the meeting between all the captains and admirals is held. For someone who has been bred to be a war machine Khan really does neglect his flanks, even when hits are being registered on his right, he completely ignores Kirk. Who does that? Not a battle hardened, strategic master of combat, that's for sure. What were Khan's motives for saving the away team on Kronos anyway? He could have easily let them get wiped out and still negotiated with Sulu for his crew. He would have had no fault for their death. As far as acting and script goes Chris Pine was just painful to watch. There isn't a shred of Kirk in that man. All the Original Series references and homages were really forced. Every time Bones opened his mouth it felt awkward and out of place. As much as I like Zachary Quinto he definitely is a shoddy Vulcan. Benedict Cumberbatch's performance on the other hand was fantastic. It was a bit too reminiscent of his Sherlock perhaps, but he did good nonetheless. Definitely one of the better villains in recent years, he had a really menacing presence in every scene, save for the couple of instances of combat stupidity. And then there was Alice Eve... I can't even wrap it around my head how pointless her character was. I hate to think that Abrams wrote her in the script, I'd rather think she was a product of producer meddling, because they just wanted some eye candy at one point or another. All in all I was disappointed by the script and a good portion of the acting. Not to mention the extreme scarcity of extra terrestrial characters. We got a few minutes of Klingons getting whooped, and that was about it for the relevance of other races (except for Spock). The very human-centric cast was a huge blunder, as we got to see at least a couple of characters that you just want to know more about, like the android guy and the scaly lady on bridge. Not to mention Keenser, that was just such a disappointing and stupid way to use the character. He was...well...nothing. He just was. Speaking of wasted potential - how about some more scenes of Terran life? The ones that were there were definitely interesting.My rating is 6/10 because despite all the shortcomings it's still a rather entertaining film and Benedict Cumberbatch's performance lends greatly to that.",Star Trek Into Darkness
629,toddkvamme,Rather entertaining and well acted,9,4 June 2013,"I read a few of the negative reviews for this film and to be frank I cannot entirely disagree with what they had to say. There was indeed not a lot of thought provoking dialog or situation in this movie. But...it was really rather entertaining none the less, and the Khan character was fantastic. That voice! Holy cow...it was like he was speaking some enchanted language that just made you want to listen. And while a lot of summer ""blockbuster"" movies have tended to rely too heavily on special effects rather than story to entertain the audience, this film did a great job, I think, of putting the effects in service of the story...as it should be. As I have said in other reviews...good effects will never save a bad story...but good effects can make a marginal story more entertaining. So...well done.

Forget the positive reviews here. If you know or care anything about Star Trek, then this movie is simply so disconnected from its roots that, it frankly beggars belief. Yes, JJ Abrahms has unleashed another Hollywood behemoth to follow up his triumphant 2009 outing sure to please the investors, but Trekkie's will, no doubt, be in mourning. The latest outing for the crew of the USS Enterprise is a grinding disappointment - all crash and bang - amounting to little more than ""Tranformers"" with . . er. . . klingons in the form of the odd the snippy script line, occasionally decent dialogue, less than usual levels of predictability (only just) and a Leonard Nimoy cameo akin to a Vincent Price come back. Jr Spock gets into a mind altering and character obliterating fisty cuffs with bad-ass Khan (decently played by Benedict Cumberbatch) before shedding buckets of unVulcan tears over his Captain's dying body (the side effect of kicking a nuclear core back into action - don't you know). But, by the time Kirk is (inevitably) revived from his deathly irradiation (sorry did I just give away the screamingly obvious?) by Karl Urban's unacceptably cheesy McCoy - Trekkies everywhere will be wailing too, not least at things like Chris Pine's appallingly pink lipstick and Uhuru's (Zoe Saldana) cringeworthy bust up with ""Pointy"" (Zachary Quinto!). To be fair though, as action movies go - this is Abrahms at his dollar raking best smashing and crashing and exploding. It is just that as Star Trek movies go - well - this is a travesty.

Compared to the first star trek, they have really improved some of the CGI work and the enterprise star ship looks incredible. Also you get more of a look at some of the non-space areas such as London.The storyline was much better than the first one; much deeper and there is more character relationship development in comparison to the first movie.

633,vicsinghbahra,Star Trek Into Cliché,1,9 June 2013,"I really wanted to like this film, as I liked the first, but as soon as I realised the plot was flawed I realised Abrahams had made a mistake.In the previous Star Trek film Abrahams had cleverly changed the time line from Kirk's birth onwards. So everything that occurs after that point is different. This film is flawed because everything before that point is EXACTLY the same as the ""normal"" Star Trek Universe. It follows Star Trek canon. These are Abrahams rules not mine.In the Star Trek Series (Space Seed) and film Wrath of Khan, the villain Khan Noonien Singh is portrayed as a man of colour. He is referred to as ""northern Indian"" and ""Sikh"".Cue the cliché!! It appears to me the script writers under Abrahams direction we're too lazy to explore north Indian , Sikh warrior culture. The Scythian legacy, and their cultural traits, so they opted for the easy Hollywood cliché. The English speaking villain. OK if he was a man of colour like Ricardo Motalban and has an English accent I would have said OK, thats fair enough, but to have a white actor play a chap with the name Khan Noonien Singh? We live in the 21st Century Abraham's. Most kids listen to world music. They understand the diverseness of culture. They understand Khan Noonien Singh is not an English name. Not even a white man's name.Based on that I just couldn't take this Americanised jingoistic garbage seriously. It's fallen far from the Roddenberry ideal.There were other bit's that got up my nose:1) Massacre round the table cue Godfather 3. I was waiting to hear ""F*ck you Joey Zaza!"" 2) Borne Identity chase on foot between ""Khan"" and Spock...utter nonsense. 3) Cue Star Wars Jedi Knight type leaping from flying crafts. 4) Also you cannot change the appearance of the Klingons...he's done that here. 5) Also what's with all the lens flares? 6) Seeing people fly into space? We've seen it in the last film, so now Abrams doesn't have one but a dozen.",Star Trek Into Darkness
634,libby-xyz,Really just an Action Flick in Space,5,30 July 2021,"Abrams completely ignores Star Trek Canon and completely ignores the Star Trek opening that Pine recited at the end of the movie: ""to explore strange, new worlds; to seek out new life and new civilizations; to boldly go where no man has gone before"". He rewrote an episode from the original series, and added a lot of explosions and destruction to stretch out a story that Roddenberry told in 50 minutes to make it a 2 hour 13 minute action flick.At least someone went to the trouble to hire actors that resembled the original ST cast and the actors stepped into those roles so seamlessly it was like stepping back in time when I was a child watching Star Trek on TV. It is the actors who portrayed these beloved characters that made this awful schlock watchable. Even if Abrams took Roddenberry's Kahn and threw on a tilt a wheel and reassembled the story into something completely unrecognizable from the original story. At least the actors knew the great task that they had been given and they succeeded beyond my wildest imaginations. Bravo Chris Pine, Zachary Quinto, Keith Urban, Zoe Saldana, John Cho, Simon Pegg and Anton Yelchin. Well done! Thank you Anton Yelchin for giving us a young Chekov again. Rip.I hate that Abrams had no reverence for Roddenberry or the world he created under the Star Trek name. To him it was just an action flick where things got smashed.I hope that more Star Trek movies are made and they hire a director who loves the Star Trek universe as much as its legions of fans and who will take Roddenberry's vision and canon as gospel and not try to give us a lousy reimagination.",Star Trek Into Darkness
635,jimmmgen,Roddenberry is Spinning in His Grave,2,12 September 2013,"I didn't watch this movie in the theater, because having seen the trailer I sensed it would be little more than a CGI fest. I finally relented and watched it on On Demand last night, and my intuition was correct: there is hardly a scene in the entire movie that doesn't rely on some kind of spectacular special effect.As a fan of the original TV series, the biggest problem I have with this movie is its complete departure from Roddenberry's admittedly Utopian view of a future in which the people of Earth have evolved into a much more peaceful and tolerant breed (yeah, I know this ST reboot takes place in an ""alternate universe""). Once key point of this movie, amongst others, seems to be that in the 23rd Century you can't trust Starfleet any more than you can trust the U.S. Government in our time.Sad.",Star Trek Into Darkness

I'm not going to get into analytical critiquing that so many others have for no good reason other than some type of self-gratifying (Ahem) exercise. This update has all the best parts of what fans were screaming for, and a great storyline even for the non-trekker.At the end of the film, it was noted that the Enterprise was ""beginning a five-year mission"" like in the original series.

637,robertjastrow,Garbage,1,18 May 2013,"JJ, you really are destroying a large piece of scifi history.Star Trek was never an action based show/movie. It was always a story that had supporting action elements. This movie is completely devoid of any cohesive story and is an action junkies dream come true.Kirk in the original series was confident, capable, intelligent, suave, etc.... The new and improved JJ version of the character is a moron. Don't get me wrong, I really like the choice of actor, but the character portrayal which is dictated by the writers and directors is everything the original Kirk was not.Space ships crush under pressure....its physics dumba**es...the Enterprise is not a submarine. I could go on and on, but I find it all a bit depressing.

In each episode I felt that somehow the normal bounds of my reality might recede or even be blown apart as I went boldly with the USS Enterprise crew into unimaginable places and situations. I like JJ Abrams and expected more.. all I got was Hollywood. It may as well have been a console game.. at least I would have been able to set phaser to stun and picked off the crew and cast one by one. Disappointing. Best film I saw last year was Safety Not Guaranteed... a Sci-Fi film for grown-ups. Great effects, funny, great characters and an estimated budget of $750k. Star Trek's is estimated at $190 MILLION.

639,whoa17,Star Trek Into Darkness review,8,29 May 2013,"Story: This movie is basically a tale of revenge and hunger for war, although the latter wasn't expressed well because it was only a desire of one character. However the former is what made this movie what it is, the villain is wreaking havoc to get back his crew or to what they did to him and his crew and one of the protagonist is after the villain because he *SPOILERS* caused the death of a character *SPOILERS*. I liked the story of this movie because it was simple, it wasn't making itself complicated. You can easily grasp the story and once you're in, it's hard not to look away.Acting: If you've seen the first installment you can pretty much say that the acting is the same but in this movie the actors were given a little more to work with because they are much more emotionally driven here. They were able to give the characters more depth than the usual. Having said that I'm now going to delve in to Benedict Cumberbatch's performance. I consider this as one of his best performance to date, he was a threatening force that can bring an end to the enterprise. He was able to show a ruthless villain but you can also feel sorry for him despite his extreme methods, and to top that with his deep epic voice, we may have one of the most memorable villains on screen. I also liked Zachary Quinto here, he was able to play with his emotions, first he was this emotionless dickwad and the next is he is a caring ally. What I didn't like here though is Alice Eve as Carol Wallace, she gave almost no intensity to the role and the character had very little development.Action: The previous one had more action scene in terms of gun fights (or should I say laser/plasma fights?) but this one had more fights in the hand-to- hand combat department. Cumberbatch was able to hold his own in action scenes and Pine and Quinto was also able to show more of their action side. Music: I loved the score in this film, it remained true to it's predecessor and you can feel the awe in each scene through the wonderful score of Michael Giacchino.Cinematography/ VFX: Like the score, I also loved the cinematography here. The looks of the film feels very authentic and it almost feels like it's a real thing. Next is the VFX, it was amazing, especially the part where the USS Vengeance crashes on San Francisco, wow to put things simple, amazing.Direction: J.J. Abrams directed this film the way he directed the first one. I liked the pacing that he did in this film, it wasn't fast and it wasn't slow either which is a good thing because you are able to understand more of it's story and more of the character's motives. Overall: 'Star Trek Into Darkness' is solid a sci-fi film with great performance from the cast especially Benedict Cumberbatch. Top that off with amazing visuals and an enchanting score from Giacchino, this is sure to be one of my favorite films of this year. Good job J.J. and cast and crew, I give this a 4.5/5",Star Trek Into Darkness

641,zampaz,"Forgettable bad sci-fi. Not Trek, meh.",2,20 August 2013,"This second Abrams film continues the new paradigm of boldly taking bad science to new frontiers that it's never been before in the Star Trek universe. A forgettable story is Abrams scaffold for lens flares, handycams and special effects sold to investors based upon the number of explosions per 10 minute interval. The contrived special effects made no sense in the context of surrounding volcanic, ocean bottom and weightless environments sure to astound the kiddies. Being a fan of the original ST, of course I don't like to see what is happening as Paramount fracks the Star Trek universe to exploit the last drop of crude action potential while ignoring the sustainable and more abundant imaginative philosophical and scientific wonder-story potential Roddenberry/Fontana used to build the first Star Trek universe. Instead of creating, Paramount and Abrams simply rob from the dead. The director was doubtless chosen by Paramount for the Franchise because Abrams would focused on the unimaginative target anti-science audience market segment that knows nothing of Newtons laws. The absurd parallel universe created in the first Abrams ST film had an opportunity to boldly go to new places and confront philosophical issues as Roddenberry did. The broken cliché alternate universe time paradox ""deus ex machina"" places the youthful good actors in likable characters in a universe in which they don't belong. The priority was to call on market maker tags such as Kahn, tribbles, and Klingons that identify the film with the Star Trek franchise and tap a new market for old productions to enhance DVD sales/rental revenues.The acting wasn't a failure.

642,AlxP-64,"Decent CGI, bad 3D and a weak story",6,18 May 2013,"Six stars out of ten may seem overly generous, but please consider that this film fulfills at least some of the expectations of the audience: the cameras were on, with the lens caps off and pointed in the general direction of the actors; the costume department supplied colorful costumes, including some very sexy (if rather sexist) uniforms for the female personnel of the Fleet; the computer-generated sets are not horrible, just unbelievable and borderline steampunk; there was a script telling a story of sorts; the actors took time to memorize their lines; and the music is not obnoxious.I saw the 3D variant of the movie—and here comes the first disappointment: the 3D is badly done. The movie is filmed as if it was regular 2D, complete with many scenes filmed with a limited depth of field (yes! new revolutionary technique! shallow DoF in 3D!), with the result that quite often there is an out-of-focus foreground, an out-of-focus background and a flat but in-focus middle plane. After an hour or so I actually tried to take the special glasses off and to my surprise the film continued to be quite watchable, even if somewhat blurry in places.This being a Star Trek movie nobody expects great feats of acting performance, but everybody expects a good story. There is indeed a story, but it's rather not so good. Actually, it's quite weak, and too simple and short—the last 30 minutes or so of the movie are content-free and pointless, since by that time the story is over and we had found out everything there was to find out.*** HERE BE SPOILERS ***You see, the Star Fleet is not militarized and its ships are essentially unarmed. (What! Not militarized! And those admirals, captains, commanders, lieutenants, what are they? Just ordinary civilians with fancy job titles?) Now the Klingon Empire is out there, and their Fleet is militarized and armed with military weapons and stuff, and the Klingons have already conquered two whole planets. A rogue, psychopathic, and generally bad admiral makes an elaborate and overcomplicated plan to nudge the Federation into war with the peaceful Klingons, militarize the Fleet and assume the role of war leader. The Enterprise with captain Kirk in command is unwittingly volunteered to be a sacrificial pawn. (One may think that the film is called Into the Darkness because they are kept in the dark, as it were.) Captain Kirk objects to this role, considering it to be rather deleterious for his career and well-being. Fisticuffs ensue. (Isn't it amazing how often officers of a high-tech star-faring Fleet need to use their fists in interstellar fights?)What do we learn from this film? In the future, orbital mechanics will be declared a reactionary science and then completely forgotten and erased from physics. As a result, if a starship loses power while in orbit it will fall down to Earth. Interstellar ships are fully capable to maneuver in the atmosphere and under water, not to mention that they can survive re-entry. Lifeless planets with breathable atmospheres are aplenty in our neck of the Galaxy. The source of oxygen in the atmosphere of a lifeless planet is left as an exercise to the members of the audience. Interstellar ships use reactive thrusters to maneuver. Unfortunately we are not told from were they get the reaction mass. It's all right for the XO of a Fleet starship to have an intimate relationship with a lieutenant who is assigned to the same ship. Engineering personnel is apparently genetically engineered to work unprotected near warp cores which are venting coolant (or steam? did I mention that the computer-generated sets are borderline steampunk?). Actually, unprotected humans can survive in a warp core long enough to be able to perform useful work there. Warp cores are engineered with generous tolerances, so that they can be brought into alignment by applying vigorous kicks. The use of hands-free headsets will become so completely unfashionable that even Fleet officers on hazardous missions will absolutely refuse to use them. It is essential to train the crew of an interstellar Fleet ship in unarmed and close-quarters combat, because such skills are quite often required for the successful completion of their missions.",Star Trek Into Darkness

I never had a high opinion of Roddenberry, who seemed to have gotten his original idea from the 50s movie, ""Forbidden Planet"", but never acknowledged this. It wasn't until he was gone before the show was free to reach it's potential and go outside the box with DS9. Why? Those characters were edgy, earthy, as real people with real emotions and behaviors were.For that same reason, the new reboot is far and away superior to all that's gone before. The characters are far more human, interesting and edgy.

644,alexandresobreira-12-509311,"Nice action with terrible plot, as usual nowadays",4,17 June 2013,"I can't really say I'm disappointed by Star Trek Into Darkness. I already expected the story to be weak. I just didn't expect it so be so bad. I get the impression most scriptwriters nowadays have never read a book in their lives, and all they can do is copy ideas from other similar movies and patch them together to make their own. There are TONS of good science fiction stories out there they could adapt to the big screen, but I'm afraid they have never read them or even heard about their authors, so they keep serving us the same reheated bad dishes over and over again. Take the opening sequence: in a good story, they would have sent a probe down there, made at least of the same material Spock's suit is made of, with the cold fusion (forgive me for repeating this absolutely nonsensical name for what is obviously a freezing device. Apparently just because ""cold fusion"" has the adjective ""cold"" in its name, the writers believe it to be something that freezes things, and not a hypothetical nuclear reactor that would operate at room temperature (which is what the term actually means - if you're going to invent a futuristic device, don't give it a name that already exists! Learn from the Original Series: that's why they came up with ""phaser"", instead of ""laser"". Then we have Star Fleet command meeting in a top staff meeting room that is on top of a building, all enclosed in glass windows. Anyone who knows what the actual meeting room of the chiefs of staff in the Pentagon or NORAD look like will know this is complete imbecility. Also, the city that is the headquarters of Star Fleet has no security whatsoever. And let's not bring up the idea that they have gone complacent: even the most peaceful society would need urban police, not to mention city and planetary defenses, since the Federation has enemies, and not just the Klingons. These are all plot devices made to create the situations that move the story forward. But they are all absurd and nonsensical. Apparently, no one can think of a reasonable and acceptable way of moving the story forward anymore. Like, Kahn could easily have teleported himself to the middle of the conference room and, considering his abilities, killed most people there before they could react, and then beaming out to Q'ono'oS when Kirk found a way to put him in a jam. Of course, Khan saying that Admiral Marcus wanted him because of his savagery, since ""wars are not won by logic"" (actually, they are - if you are a better strategist and has better equipment, you will win a war), they needed him because he ""can kill"". Of course humans are 100% peaceful: the brutality of the cadets that beat up Kirk in the first movie and the fact that the Enterprise and other Federation exporation starships are loaded with photon torpedoes and phasers prove that! Come on! All Admiral Marcus had to do was to get people to improve the weapons they already had. He had no need for Khan. He had no problems finding people to help him build the weapons designed for Kahn, so he should be able to find engineers to help him design them. And the list goes on: Kahn needs them to lower the shields so he could beam his people off the Enterprise, but Admiral Marcus had no problem beaming his daughter off with the shields up. They only needed Khan's blood to save Kirk. That could as easily have been gotten out of his corpse. You don't leave superdangerous and superpowerful insane mass murderers alive. And they had already been condemned as war criminals, as the Admiral points out. Dozens of Klingons and 3 birds of pray can't get one single shot on a man? Also, J. J. Adams said that, and I quote, ""the time travel-alternate reality concept used in the previous film was a deliberate ploy to enable a reboot for new sagas/films: 'The idea, now that we are in an independent timeline, allows us to use any of the ingredients from the past - or come up with brand-new ones - to make potential stories.' "" And all they can come up is a ripoff of The Wrath of Khan?? I'm really afraid that, unless a new generation of scriptwriters comes along, TV is going to take away all good stories and just leave bad plots like this one to Cinema.

Ah... NOT.Attractive females in various portrayals and undress are 100% vital to all forms of drama. Not just SF. Vital to viewers both gay and straight.The few who don't appreciate showing Alice Eve (Dr. Marcus) in her undies include certain graduates of University PC Conditioning Programs who haven't yet figured out how badly they've been cheated. Cheated of an education that includes something resembling a useful skill. Said scene hits the humor point that this Kirk at this time is 100% Lothario, hustling every female he comes near. Kirk overnights with two lookers not necessarily of his own species and still he hustles. Not PC, but funny and 100% in-character. Don't forget that W.J. Clinton and J.F. Kennedy shared this leadership aptitude and playboy appetite.Early in the Klingon confrontation, camera POV is from Zoe Saldana (Uhura's) thigh-level showing inner-thigh gap and where they meet. Gratuitous? Absolutely. But in the darkened theater, alone with my fantasies, I liked it.Nits (in the spirit of making the next movie better / stuff problematic for me): 1) UFP Starships don't go underwater. Shuttles maybe, but even a (second) shuttle need not be a part-time submarine. Just park it in low planetary orbit or fly racetracks high in the atmosphere. Same plot/mission accomplished without straining credibility too far (for my tastes).2) A planetary extinction level event (ELE) volcano is possible in science. Needed for dramatic plotting? Meh. A culture (oddly resembling the humanoids from Prometheus) living on its slopes is in enough jeopardy. The science and drama of this part were twisted - as was the solution.A device that can quiet a super-volcano is a tough sell to my formal / self-eduction. Red Matter from the prior movie is an instant black hole, not a heat transfer (refrigeration) unit. Such a refrigeration unit, even in the Rodenberry-verse, would probably be a lot bigger than a bowling ball. It would need to be capable of sucking up a few hundred megatons of thermal energy in a few seconds. Just saying.A better plot solution with accepted Rodenberry tech could involve transporting the people their structures and the things that they make to a safer place Do it while most sleep. Such a move would certainly make an impact on their culture, but perhaps less than a Starship breaching the nearby sea. Survivors would have legends, but they would be of an awakening day not including a tribal artist drawing a very accurate picture of it.3) Why use totally inadequate-looking dish thrusters to stop the Enterprise's crashing descent through Earth's atmosphere? Early in, we see anti-gravity well established and a no big deal tech. Full-ship Anitgravity, previously used in the opening scene and probably offline till the last possible second, could have been sufficiently dramatic and nicely visualized with disturbances in clouds and air. You could even get close to the Earth and smash a few square miles of trees Tunguska-style.4) Abrams has Starships hit warp drive fairly close to space docks. We were previously told that this is a bad idea. Something about Newtonian actions and reactions was implied but not spelled out.I do like the new visualization of warp energy wakes.5) General Marcus having a Dr. Strangelove meets Al Haig messiah-complex is a rather tired plot angle. Too PC. I'd like to think there's a better fitting motivation for an antagonist, but I may be wrong.6) High-level, high-value military men are having a regulation-driven meeting when they come under surprise attack. They can't beam out of the secure conference room instantly? Are you kidding me? If transporter tech were available today, no such meeting would take place without the bug-out coordinates wired to a panic button in each and every conference chair. You could still have the mentor fumbling with his cane and that taking too long leading to his death. Kirk on counter-attack could be similarly plotted. My second biggest nit.7) Khan has ""Magic Blood"" with any number of wonderful properties. It saves a sick little girl and a 100% dead Tribble. McCoy wants some more of it, so he orders that Khan, be captured, not killed. Set phaser on stun. WHAT? Meanwhile Khan is rather busy causing all sorts of death, destruction and miscellaneous mayhem.McCoy has forgotten that there are 72 Meat-Popsicles aboard the Enterprise, each with similar magic blood in their veins.Another fan found these nits: 1) A re-animated Tribble doesn't move off the table where it was revived, despite the passing of time and the ship being shaken around with some vigor.2) Artificial Gravity that fails under attack make sense. The portrayal here does not.",Star Trek Into Darkness
649,andy-barbieri,'Star Trek Into Darkness',9,15 May 2013,"First up, I wouldn't say that I'm a huge Star Trek fan, probably more what you could call a casual fan (Did a bit of 'extra research' into the mythos to learn a bit more before I went down to the 'Destination Star Trek: London' convention last year), and I did enjoy JJ Abrams' first Trek film. And on that basis, was looking forward to his second installment.Well, it was a whole lot of fun! To borrow a tagline from another film, it was an ""epic of epic epicness!"" A very entertaining entry into the world of Kirk, Spock and company. A blend of action, of which there was quite a lot, humour and a bit of emotion (especially, I felt, at the start with Noel Clarke that kick starts the events of the film).The banter between Kirk (Chris Pine) and Spock (Zachary Quinto) and their clash of personalities is at the heart of the film, especially towards the end. Kirk does seem to have matured a bit since the last film, and Spock still plays by the rules, but they do play off each other very well. The rest of the cast have their moments in the sun as well, plus Dr Carol Marcus (Alice Eve) is a good addition to the cast as well. But it was Benedict Cumberbatch that stole the show for me. His character did remind of his excellent portrayal of Sherlock and in 'Into Darkness' he played a villain that was very manipulating and captivating when he was on screen. And to be honest, you wouldn't expect anything less from Cumberbatch!The soundtrack from Michael Giacchino is typically Giacchino too and is very bold and sweeps you along throughout the film. The piano led piece 'London Calling' starts very emotional and definitely helps set the scene it's in at the beginning of the film. Giacchino is fast becoming one of my favourite score composers.After watching this, it's definitely safe to conclude that JJ Abrams knows how to shoot an action film. The effects didn't seem to just be there for the sake of it and served a purpose. Although you might not say that about his tradmark lens flares, which were certainly present throughout (glad I was watching it in 3D and wearing those darker 3D specs!). With his next film being 'Star Wars Episode VII', I have no doubt that it'll be in safe hands, minus those lens flares hopefully.With a decent villain being the perfect foil to the characters that we know and love, and with a few nods towards the Star Trek of the original series, you've got a pretty damn good film, and you don't really need to be a fan of Star Trek to enjoy it, but it will help!",Star Trek Into Darkness
650,kirkmccoy,Wow!,10,25 May 2013,"I loved, loved this movie, all 7 times I've seen it in the past week. Finally saw it in 3D today. Forget the 3D. The best part of this movie were the characters. They have all grown so much; they now own the series. For the stats I am 69 years old, a woman who loved the original series and saw the very first episode the very first airing. This movie had so much energy; the music is fantastic, really keeps the adrenaline flowing; the sound effects spectacular; the special effects wonderful. And I can't say enough about Chris Pines' blue eyes.Special kudos to Simon Pegg as Scotty. He was the voice of reason, he was funny, passionate and dramatic in turn. I also can't say enough about Chris Pine as an actor. He had to endure a roller-coaster of emotions and expressed them all exceedingly well. I really think he deserves an academy award nomination. I felt Spock was more like the old Spock in this sequel; strong and wow when he gets mad...! Uhura really was impressive and I love the 3-way dialogue in the shuttle.I do hope the trequel will be all of them pitching in together on some planet to help the beings, discussing ethics, morality and all the things humans are challenged with current day. Enough of the violence (although I loved every minute of it) but Star Trek is about hope and a positive vision for the future using their wits to solve problems, not fists, not super powerful weapons. May they continue to boldly go and hopefully not wait so long for the next installment; I'm too old to wait another 4 years.",Star Trek Into Darkness
651,kcwilsonii,"Not just bad Star Trek, but a bad movie as well",2,17 September 2013,"a new plot would have been nice. This movie was not very good. awash with plot holes and way too many lens flares ( I assume this was to distract from the bad movie). You spend the hour of the film with a rapid fire switching from one character to the next just so they can all say a couple lines. This gets exceptionally repetitive and boring as no one character really gets to be focused on. Simon Pegg is great as Scotty and Karl Urban stands out again as Bones.. The bad guy eventually shows up but his revenge scheme seems rather muddled and has little payback for him. Not quite sure what he will do after he blows everything up.This is a very forgettable Star Trek movie, please don't let JJ Abrahms do another and get Joss Whedon to do Star Wars, at least he has original thoughts and a brain.",Star Trek Into Darkness
652,yaldish,"'Die Hard' in space - 6,5/10",6,10 May 2013,"Ever heard of Die Hard in space? Well, here you have it. As much as there are things to enjoy in this movie, there are more things that aren't half as enjoyable. Now, I am not a fan or a fan boy of Star Trek in general, I haven't been watching the old series and the way I understood it, you don't have to do that in order to watch and enjoy both of J.J. Abrams Star Trek films.Let's just forget the plot-holes, the loud booms and bangs, (bad)jokes and loud music for a few seconds. Benedict Cumberbatch did a superb job as a villain and Zachary Quinto who is just great as Spock and I felt for both of them as characters (for a little while). I couldn't care less about Kirk, and the way I understand it is that he's supposed to be a very iconic character.The visuals in this film were actually pretty stunning, the production design was beautiful to look at and you of course got a bit of lens flares in every scene - which I didn't have problem with in the beginning, but if you're known for having a lot of lens flares in your movies (which is very easy to add) then I think you'll have to find a different style. It felt as if Abrams wanted everything to be perfect, and that's where I think he/ or this movie failed. There were moments in it which as I said, was actually pretty good, but those were the moments in which everything felt human/natural and authentic; and we didn't get a lot of those moments.I couldn't engage in this film personally, not even as a person who loves visually stunning movies. It's as if a robot made this movie because after a while, I did not care about the story, what the characters felt or wanted and especially what 'Khan' wanted and that was a big problem for me who actually looked forward to seeing him. The movie was all up in your face. A pretty empty film with a lot of surface and no spirit that lost my attention after a while.",Star Trek Into Darkness

In fact, I don't even remember watching any episode of the series. The closest I've been to ST is that ""facepalm"" meme (of the baldy) that was rather popular years ago.OK, so yesterday I watched Into the Darkness. So awesome, I felt the need to watch it again right after I came out of the cinema. I really appreciate it's one of those rare movies nowadays that does not insult the intelligence of the viewer. (COUGH *iron man 3* COUGH)The acting was brilliant. The characters were so likable, specifically Spock and Khan, and the humor was always on point.As for the CGI and special effects, if you thought those in Oblivion were impressive, ST will simply take your breath away.

654,HarveyA2010,My Favorite Film,9,8 June 2013,"Wow this film is so good and I couldn't think of anything negative to say about it until I went deep into what I didn't like about the movie.I will start off with my negatives, firstly the cliché story of a lesser character helping the bad guy because his child is dying and the bad guy can save them, but as I think about this there isn't really any other way you would play that out.I felt that the Khan (Benedict Cumberbatch) vs. the Klingons was bad ass but there wasn't much of it, I also would of liked to have seen more of Uhura (Zoe Saldana) Kirk (Chris Pine) and Spock (Zachary Quinto) interacting with the Klingons, but maybe that is being saved for the third instalment.I'm sure J.J Abrams has an addiction to lens flare, and that it must be in every other shot.I really loved the action in this film, I thought the sets were brilliant, the music was good, it was funny but not too funny, I absolutely loved the scene with Kirk and Khan flying towards the Blackbird ship (Marcus's Ship) and avoiding the debris, I was on the edge of my seat.I also loved how like the first J.J Abrams Star Trek film that it related to the TV series with the music and the fact they were going on there 5 year mission.I really do love this film and I'm more of a Star Wars fan, so its got to be good hasn't it to make my top 3 films of all time. I really cant wait for the threequal.Thank you for reading my review I hope you found it useful, 10/10 :)",Star Trek Into Darkness
655,randykrus,Meh,4,3 June 2013,"In all fairness, I wasn't going to go to this movie. I wasn't impressed with the first one. While it wasn't terrible, it was pretty forgettable. Not a hallmark of a great movie. But some friends talked me into it so here I am. Déjà vu.And much like the first movie I'm kinda torn here. While there are many things going right for this movie (it looks beautiful) I still can't get past the feeling I had 3/4 of the way through it as the (SPOILER) Enterprise is falling toward Earth in what should have been the most intense part of the movie...I was bored, so bored that as the ship was falling to Earth I actually thought that this would be a good time to run the credits over the scene. Maybe it had something to do with the fact that this scene seemed to tacked on (like many other scenes) that its hard to imagine they actually did it. Or maybe it had something to do with the fact that I didn't care if the ship did crash, killing everyone on board.The first part of the movie was smart. The plot and the character development seemed headed in an interesting direction. But ultimately, it fizzled. And so to make up for it, they throw in some really unnecessary scenes to create the tension that the main story arch should have provided. I dunno....after watching both movies, I really think they should refocus their energy into doing a TV series....that is where Star Trek has always shined. That is where Star Trek was always the most interesting. A medium where they can create more substance....and fewer explosions. Action scenes and explosions were never what Star Trek was about. I actually feel that these movies are doing Star Trek a disservice.",Star Trek Into Darkness
656,Amp1234,I thought it was a good sequel,7,20 May 2013,"I had no expectations for this film and I think that's why I liked it. Unfortunately a jerk movie critic spoiled some of the plot twists, without warning. Even so, it was a good film. The CGI was spot on, and this film had a lot more action than the first Abrams rendition. A lot of people complained that it was loud, dumb and unoriginal. That's not the case at all. I personally have never seen any star trek prior to these reboots. Any content in the film is new to me. I'm aware of all the characters, like Kirk, and Spock, as it'd be hard not to know of them. But it was established in the first film that this was an alternate universe. They were changing the flow of events for every character. Even if Abrams pulled ideas from previous episodes or movies, it's not the same.It's also a double edged sword. If Abrams ignored any of the previous movies, or episodes, fan-boys would be upset that he veered too far off from the originals. Now they complain that they're too close to the originals. Ugh.It was a good sequel, which is a rarity nowadays. The only reason I'm giving it a 7 is because it was good, but it didn't blow me away. Would I buy it? Yes. Would I see it again? Yes. Did it change movie history? No.I'm now looking forward to see what Abrams can do with Star Wars.",Star Trek Into Darkness

Spock vs Kahn was freaking amazing. Other than some minor flaws, I didn't have any problems with the movie.Loved it.I can't stress it enough. Can't wait for it to come on DVD/Blu-ray.The minor problems I have is that Pike died like right off the bat, and that they took the Enterprise away from Kirk not long enough for it to be necessary. Those really my only problems with the film.So I give this awesome movie a 9/10. Not a perfect score because it was not a perfect movie, but it is worth every penny you spend on it (including concessions).",Star Trek Into Darkness
658,kalgo-725-870078,"re-telling of Space Seed, not Wrath",7,29 June 2013,"If this movie were a stand-alone sci-fi movie, I would have liked it much more. But being part of star trek, I am not thrilled with it. On the plus side, the visuals/effects, cinematography, casting, and script are fabulous. Abrams is awesome at directing, and what he has done with my favorite franchise in terms of special effects has brought tears to my eyes, in a good way. But I liked the 2009 movie better than this one. One problem is that the trailers mislead you about key aspects of the story, so you feel kinda misled and disappointed. Another problem is that in both movies, someone is responsible for not knowing how to fight a proper starship space battle. The battle scenes in both movies are done all wrong, too quick, no strategy. Someone needs to watch the Wrath of Khan and Nemesis to see how it is done. For those of us who are into star trek, I think it makes sense to view this as Space Seed, and not the Wrath of Khan, though, you could say that it is a retelling of both stories. I say, why retell either of them? Isn't there a big galaxy of original stories to tell? I guess not. In general, I think the story is no good. I did really like how it was Spock, with his superior physical and mental abilities, who must fight Khan hand-to-hand. I'd like to see Saldana put on a few pounds. I don't get how they allow Alice Eve to keep her non-American accent when her father has an American accent. Why can't Spock kill Harrison? Don't we have 70 supermen worth of blood in the sickbay to revive Kirk? I liked the part of the engine room in which Kirk had to re-align a plasma thingy. I don't like that the engine room is a brewery-it looks way too low tech. Again, my main complaint was the story, I didn't like it.",Star Trek Into Darkness
659,rsjovertoom,Strong sequel to the Star Trek revival from 2009,7,17 August 2013,"In 2009 the Star Trek franchise was given a serious upgrade with the monster budget blockbuster Star Trek - The Future Begins. It was directed by JJ Abrams, who took the movie into a different direction. It was a very vivid movie with lots of humor, action and of course outstanding special effects. Many true Star Trek fans didn't like it, because it was way different than the old Star Trek movies and series, but I really loved it, so I had high hopes for the sequel Star Trek - Into Darkness. And I wasn't disappointed.Into Darkness starts with Kirk saving Spocks life, but by doing that breaking fundamental laws. Kirk of course doesn't care at all about those rules. His friend's life is way more important. Spock on the other hand reports the violation, which costs Kirk his command of the Enterprise and drives a wedge between their friendship. After a terrorist attack on the Star Fleet headquarters shakes things up dramatically, Kirk goes after the man responsible. The rest of the story I won't reveal in case you are reading this before you watch it.Where Star trek 2009 could be annoying for Star Trek fans, because it was so different than the old Trek stuff, this one will probably be even worse. Many elements from old Star trek movies are used, including a very important character: Khan. But the new Khan is played by a white British actor, whereas the old Khan was an Indian man. The name Khan doesn't fit the looks of the chosen actor at all. Also some of the dialogue from the old Trek movies is used, apparently. So Trekkies be warned. there might be a lot you will not like, or disagree with.There are other issues with the movie, though small ones. Especially some of the supporting actors get very limited screen time, where I feel they should have had much more. Scotty, Sulu, Chekov, Bones, Uhura and the Star Fleet commander played by Peter Weller all get their moments, but not enough to let their characters develop in the way I feel they deserve. Also, the storyline feels less important than the chases, fights and other exciting moments. It all goes by so fast that it feels like you will miss something if you blink.So much for the cons. Because this movie has a lot of pros. Especially the cast. We can scream until we lose our voice that Khan should be played by an Indian guy, or at least someone from an exotic country, but Benedict Cumberbatch is absolutely awesome as Khan. He is cold, unreadable, unpredictable, and has such an air of power around him. The Trekkies who feel bad about Khan not being played by an Indian guy should give Cumberbatch a chance. He will not disappoint, believe me! Peter Weller is also great as the Fleet commander. The rest of the main cast we know from the 2009 movie, and they do a good job as well.Other important strong points of the movie are: high pace (a bit too high for me, but many will love it), impressive special effects (especially the encounter with the Klingons looks very good) and the plot has a few twists that I found very nice. The plot of the 2009 movie was pretty straightforward, so I feel it was a good decision to make the plot of the sequel a bit more complicated.I enjoyed watching this movie a lot. Of course it was slightly less impressive than the 2009 movie, because we already knew most of the cast and what the special effects would be like, but the bad guys were great and I never left the edge of my seat. Into Darkness isn't perfect, and the Trek fans should keep in mind that it's going to be way different than they would expect from the old movies and series, but it's very entertaining and exciting, and I'm already looking forward to the next one!",Star Trek Into Darkness

I have no idea why so many people rated this schlockfest so highly. It is insultingly stupid; almost like an action parody of Star Trek. The story is ludicrous and completely disjointed, the characters act like morons 99.999% of the time, and the ending was a lame ripoff of a much better Trek film. The screenwriter (Roberto Orci) is a 9/11 truther which is probably why nothing makes any sense and no attempt is made to connect one plot point to another. Things just happen, the scene changes, and more things happen. This was the beginning of the end for intelligent, thoughtful Trek. Thanks a lot, Alex Kurtzman.

661,kmtwalsh,Star Trek: Into Darkness- Carries on the success of the first film,10,23 July 2016,"Although I was excited that there was another Star Trek film coming out, I was also nervous whether it would live up to the first one which I thought that it did. Everything in it was just as good as the first one had been- the cast still reminded me of the original characters, the story line was action packed and the special effects were still of the highest quality.This film opens with Kirk disobeying Star Fleet's prime directive and so as a result he is demoted to Commander and First Officer to Christopher Pike who Kirk had taken over as Captain for the Enterprise in the first film. There are terrorist attacks committed by Benedict Cumberbatch's character. In an emergency meeting that Pike, Kirk and Spock attend they are attacked by Benedict's character and as a result he kills many Star Fleet officers including Captain Pike.Admiral Marcus sends Kirk, Spock and the Enterprise to find him and kill him but it soon turns out that the Admiral has sinister reasons for wanting to kill Cumberbatch's character and for me, there was no shock when you learn the true identity of the terrorist is that he is indeed Khan and the crew have a balancing act of wondering about Khan's motives and Admiral Marcus's unstoppable barrage against the Enterprise. Khan is portrayed in a completely different way from Ricardo Montalban's version but again I think this works as it would have been totally unbelievable if Benedict had tried to do an impression of Ricardo. I think Benedict's Khan is a nice contrast to Ricardo's more fiery Khan.We are also introduced to a character that had popped up in the original Fillm, Dr Carol Marcus. There are scenes where we can see the attraction between Carol and Kirk, although it is not shown on screen if they acted on those feelings. It would be interesting if they did follow this up in any future films as it was one of the plot lines I liked in The Wrath of Khan and the search for Spock when Kirk learns that he has an adult son and then loses him in the next film.I was sad to see the end of the Christopher Pike character so near the start of the film as I enjoyed this character very much from the first film.It was also fascinating to see them reenact the scene from the original film The Wrath of Khan where Spock sacrifices his life for his colleagues on the Enterprise that always had me in tears but I liked that they twisted it on it's head in this film having Kirk sacrifice himself for the Enterprise and Spock having to deal with his friend's death and his fight with Khan.I also think the solution for Kirk's resurrection was very creative and worked well so I'm pleased to say that it carried on the success of the first film with this sequel.",Star Trek Into Darkness
662,bewellandhappy,"Film of Perfect Hair, or Fake and Lame",2,12 September 2013,"Start Trek Into Darkness is fake and lame. What is not lame in the film (such as Uhura's concern for Kirk and Kirk's relationship with his Mentor) is fake, and what is not fake (Khan's character and Spock's love) is lame. All the energy, youth and joyfulness of the first film are gone. Scotty got the best lines and single-handedly tries to carry the rags of the spirit of the first film over into this one. Chemistry between Spock and Uhura is gone. What remains? The worst casting decision since Agent Smith played Elrond: Kirk. Creators of the film should have just carried on with the line of the first film, where it was all about Kirk. My five-year daughter said: ""What is he doing"" as Kirk sat in captain's chair at the end of Star Trek. ""He is not the captain!"". And, as Spock entered the bridge, she said: ""He is"". You are not fooling anyone, even toddlers. Kirk is a waste of space. No one is interested in him. Throughout ""Into Darkness"" the only thought that was on my mind was: ""When will the blondie clear from the screen, and where is Khan?"" One would think that something is wrong with the script, when people want to see more of the bad guy and less of the ""hero"".I watched the extras on the disk. Creators boasted about how they pulled Kirk and Khan by string as they entered Admiral Marcus' ship. Star Trek is not about pulling people by the string. You can pull your children and grandchildren in your garage to amuse yourselves. Shall I remind scriptwriters, producers and director of the film what Star Trek is about - since they've clearly let it slip their minds? It is about boldly going where no one has gone before. Where did you go where no one has gone before? CGI ship crashing into a CGI San Francisco? Red forests? Is this what you're trying to amaze us with. It's 2013. Two guys jumping off a cliff into the sea? ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"" just as one example. Natives chasing explorers through woods? ""Raiders of the Lost Arc"". And your sequence of capture and imprisonment of Khan is a shot-by-shot replica of the same story with Loki from Avengers Assemble. Not to mention that a see-through cube for a prison seems to be one the most favourite staple of lazy Hollywood screen writers lately. In extras you said you were worried that we would not accept the new version of Khan. Wake up. We are the generation that was assaulted by Lukas' betrayal. We are the generation that loves Battlestar Galactica. We do not judge films on their being ""true"" to the source on the shallow level. We can tell a good product from a bad product. As Scotty got all the best lines, I am going to use one of his and say that it is a film of Perfect hair. Everyone's hair was perfect but that is just about the only thing that worked in this film. And obviously the acting by Zachary Quinto and Benedict Cumberbatch. I just hope that in their future illustrious careers they will never have to be pulled into such a travesty.

But I kept tripping over the logic (as in, lack thereof) and, although some of the homages made me smile, at least one very serious scene (near the end, if you'll seen it you'll know which) was such a close copy from an earlier film that it seemed to me to cheapen what was an incredibly moving scene in that earlier film.That said, I was carried along with the action even though I fell out of it from time to time to say, ""oh, come on, really?""

Abrams made it most of the way through, then went, ""Oh...umm... hmm... how am I going to end this? I only have about 20 minutes to tie together a bunch of storylines and set up the next movie..""I get it: reversing the roles from the pivotal scenes in Star Trek II was cute...I guess. Sadly, in this instance, doing so lacks any of the emotional punch of the original. It just comes across as ""hammy"" and induces eye rolls.Trying to be objective and remembering this is the second in a reboot of the films, you can certainly appreciate the film on its own merit. The story is mostly ok'ish. The effects are solid. You can appreciate the film as an entry into the Star Trek legacy......but those the final scenes...I don't know what else to say, aside from calling them rushed, borderline incoherent, campy, and superficial.'The Wrath of Khan' is an excellent film and a pivotal chapter in the legacy/cannon of Star Trek. If that film did not exist, perhaps 'Into Darkness' would rate higher...but, alas, neither is true....and the last 20 minutes or so of 'Into Darkness' would still be a aggravating mess.",Star Trek Into Darkness
666,lostjedi,A complicated case of uncomplicated story,4,16 May 2013,"It is really a bit difficult for me to comment on this movie, because the people I joined in watching it all thought it was excellent. I did not, and I think I know the reason: I love ""The Wrath of Khan"". For a few hours after watching it, I was sort of preoccupied with the question if knowing the old movie(s) should somehow improve your experience of ""Into Darkness"". By now I am sure: It doesn't.""Into Darkness"" is a modern action movie with great fighting scenes, effects and a near to perfect acting performance by Benedict Cumberbatch. That proved to be enough to yield a great cinematic experience in the past, if well done, and it should be here. If you do not know Star Trek or what it stands (stood) for.Things started to get out of hand once I noticed that the plot was some alternative timeline to the Khan-events. But they somehow managed to take out nearly all the aspect making ""The Wrath of Khan"" a great movie, in my opinion. ""The Wrath of Khan"" was sort of a chamber drama, mainly starring Kirk, getting older, and Khan, being riven by grief and his wrath. It was intense, Khan hating Kirk from all his heart, and Kirk using all his wits to defeat his foe. It had some clearly defined, evolving characters, but mainly focused on Kirk and his opponent. It had philosophy, and a (though maybe too obvious) meaning. All in all, it was Star Trek.Now how about ""Into Darkness""? If we just forget about Khan for a moment, every dialogue seemed to be devised to either a) have an action scene as a consequence or b) provide comic relief. There was, for example, no depth in Uhura and Spock discussing their relationship or Spock's thoughts about feeling. There could not have been any, because there was no time to elaborate and reflect. It was a fast roller-coaster trip on multiple routes. In other words: The golden thread, so obvious in ""The Wrath of Khan"", was either lacking or I simply missed it. (If it was just a simple ""friendship is great"", uh, well...).Was the repetition of dialogues from ""The Wrath of Khan"" with different speakers something like a humorous reference to the past? It seems so, because I cannot derive any sensible meaning from, for example, exchanging Kirk and Spock and so on. Carol Marcus? She did not add anything of interest to the plot (just some boobs...). I would have expected a bit more from the woman supposed to be the mother of Kirks son.As a side note, am I the only one thinking that it is odd that star fleet officers, even captains, sort of behave like schoolboys? I would have thought it would take more maturity to be in command of a spaceship...In summary, I would have like this movie as an action movie. Maybe even loved it. Maybe I could have accepted it being named ""Star Trek"" if it had not referred to ""The Wrath of Khan"" and the other timeline in general too often. But as it is, I do not manage to like it. Sorry.",Star Trek Into Darkness
667,alumini2004,"Brilliant ,Breathtaking and Amazing...!!!",10,10 May 2013,"Saw Star Trek Into Darkness last night and was totally blown away by the movie.Since i was a kid the first series that i fell in love with was the Gene Roddenberry's classic and the characters Captain Kirk and Spock, and since then i have watched all the spin off's and the movies that were made after that , while the original series is still my favourite i like the other spin/offs as well and when they rebooted the franchise like any other trekkie i was exited and when i watched the movie in 2009 i really liked it and it was the best movie of that year and the new one Into darkness is going to be one of the best if not the best movie of this year , the beauty of Into Darkness lies in its Spectacular Visuals , Story line and the characters , what i like the most about it JJ Abrams did not deviate from the original idea he still kept it very much alive unlike other directors nowadays and the credit must go to him for making such a brilliant and spectacular movie , i liked the new additions Cumberbatch and Alice eve , cumberbatch portrayal as the main antagonist in the movie was truly superb and no one could have done it better than him ,so folks forget all the B grade movies that have released in the past week or so and watch the Star Trek Into Darkness even if you are not a trekki you will be amazed by the movie.

668,ad-mckinnon,Star Trek: Into Darkness ... 8/10,8,6 June 2013,"I never thought I'd be saying this, but the new Star Trek installment is truly a cinematic experience. I did not enjoy Star Trek (2009) nor do I have any strong feelings about the originals. I was very worried about Star Wars Episode 7 when I went into this movie, simply because I felt Abrams was the wrong choice. I breathed a huge sigh of relief as the end credits rolled; he has done it, he has proved himself. That is not to say it is perfect, the film contains several sex jokes/references that I felt were unnecessary given this films genre. Aside from that though, everything I didn't like about the first installment has been almost completely eradicated, one being the love story. The controversial decision to make Spock and Uhura an item made fans angry, its still in the film however the writing has been improved dramatically and Uhura is once again a secondary character with far less screen time, the way she should stay. The most important change is that of the villain, if a film like this has a weak villain then its a weak movie. Abrams has replaced a bland and loud Eric Bana with a composed, focused and most importantly menacing Benedict Cumberbatch. His scenes are by far the most compelling however the film does stand on its own two feet without him, the relationship between Spock and Kirk is now the focal point and its executed with skilled writing and honest performances. I saw the film in 2D so I'm not able to comment on the 3D however from what I could gather it isn't worth the extra money, the film looked great in 2D and I didn't need to worry about brightness reduction. Abrams even reduced the amount of lens flares, say what you want but he clearly listens to criticism. What can I say, I was pleasantly surprised by Into Darkness and would highly recommend you see it in the cinema...this is not a DVD movie. Also, for the record I thought Spielberg would have been a good choice for Episode 7.",Star Trek Into Darkness
669,craigman-herring,Star Trek in name only,1,28 June 2013,"Here is what I don't understand: If you didn't like a show, as Abrams mentioned, why ""reimagine"" said show? Why have the same characters? Why not have an ORIGINAL movie with a whole new set of characters and back story? Oh, I know why. Because YOU ARE A HACK WITHOUT AN ORIGINAL THOUGHT! Because you want to attach the name of something great to your unimaginative derivative crap in order to make more money, and at the same time p*ss off an entire generation, more than one generation of people who hold the original Star Trek dear to their hearts for reasons you wouldn't understand. What the original Star Trek lacked in budget, it more than made up for in great stories, original characters, and a lot of heart and imagination. It seems that a lot of these types of ""movies"", like ""Transformers"", ""Man of Steel"" and such, think that non-stop special effects and CGI action somehow make up for characters you actually care for. I could list all of the things I disliked about this movie, and it's predecessor, but it can be summarized in one sentence (for both ""films""): Stupid villain causes a lot of destruction for some stupid reason or another, utilizing massive bloated budget and lots of CGI to the point of CGI overload, then villain is defeated in some stupid way that will be quickly forgotten.

672,lotharofthehillpeople420,A Death By Any Other Name,1,15 June 2013,"This movie has its strengths and its weaknesses. Building friendships, and staying true to them, it a fundamental theme of Star Trek. This movie did fine in that, though had it not, it would have been a huge betrayal of the franchise.What this story is in its essence is a cover band singing an old classic song. Others have raved about its newness, its fresh look on characters and relationships, but I am compelled to give this movie failing marks as both a critical lover of all movies and as a fan of the Star Trek franchise. It lacks originality.Alright, I wanted to go on and on about the failings of this one, but ultimately what I hate is Abrams camera style, the incessant need to have characters killed by way of being sucked into space, but more towards the writers: at least the first movie tastelessly obliterated the Star Trek universe with a new character, but to re-do a movie (the second movie at that) with Khan was sickly stupid.To their credit, the actors were fine. However, there seems to me something wrong with Chris Pine's face. His lips and nose look really puffy. And while I am at it, the new spin on Kirk's attitude seems like is was written by a teenage girl who just started getting her period.Because this movie borrowed way too much, turned Kirk into a ditsy bumbler, and tried to cover it up with music that is actually from the original movie -- seeing these things -- I pay for new and original thinking, good writing, material that works without the need for shaky camera work, quick cuts, and loads-o-special effects. And, I would say this for the Original Series as well. While at it, the Original Motion Picture was not that great, so there. But, at least it was original.",Star Trek Into Darkness
673,zevatayler,Stunning,10,17 May 2013,"This film has definitely made it only my list of favorites!The action was nothing short of magnificent. Nearly nonstop excitement from beginning to end. Incredible battles, explosions, and escapes etc.Benedict Cumberbatch gave a masterful performance. I was fully drawn into his character's intricacies. And for me, not having watched much of Star Trek before the 2009 movie, I was constantly on the edge of my seat wondering what the outcome of his actions would be.Chris Pine was outstanding in his performance as Kirk. He was every bit as intriguing as Benedict was and I found myself in laughing and crying at his portrayal. I will never understand why people criticize his being cast in this role.The death scenes were spectacular. The emotions were depicted flawlessly. I'm not one to cry at movies, but I found tears in my eyes multiple times throughout this one. The cast was absolutely wonderful and I can't think of anything I didn't enjoy about this film. I plan to see it in theaters again and will certainly purchase it as soon as it becomes available on DVD. This is assuredly one of the best films I have watched and I HIGHLY recommend seeing in the theater if you can!",Star Trek Into Darkness
674,dsphipps100,The Cheapening of Star Trek,4,26 May 2013,"There have now been twelve Star Trek movies, including ""Into Darkness."" The ""re-boot"" Star Trek of 2009 that preceded this movie was probably the 2nd worst out of all twelve movies. Into Darkness was a definite improvement. Instead of being the 2nd worst out of 12, it moved up to being only the 3rd worst out of 12. At least JJ Abrams is moving in the right direction - sort of. A little.Into Darkness is a re-vamping of the classic Khan story from the 1980s movie, ""The Wrath of Khan"" (which many fans would call the greatest Star Trek movie ever made), which was also a continuation of the story from the 1960s episode, ""Space Seed"", both of which starred Ricardo Montalbahn as Khan Nunien Singh. The Wrath of Khan featured a highly personal conflict between Kirk and Khan that made the sci-fi and the special effects take a back seat to a very powerful story. Audiences were inevitably shattered emotionally by the time that movie was over.Into Darkness, unfortunately, reduces Khan to merely another sci-fi villain who needs to be knocked down. There is a very lackluster attempt to insert a ""personal"" conflict between Kirk and Khan in this movie by arranging for Khan to be responsible for the death of a senior officer that Kirk looks up to, but it's so shallow compared to the decades-long story in the 1980s version that it actually would have been better if JJ Abrams hadn't even tried.Then there is the biggest problem with the previous 2009 ""re-boot"", which continues unabated in this movie: Before 2009, Starfleet, supposedly the most elite military force the Earth has ever seen, was always presented as (mostly) impeccably professional soldiers who followed strict military protocol (in a Star Trek way), and held to a very high moral standard of personal conduct. Even William Shatner's Kirk, as much as a renegade as he sometimes was, had certain moral principles that he would die before he would compromise them. Subsequent captains, Picard, Janeway, Sisko, and Archer, took those moral principles and standards of conduct and raised them to an even higher level, giving Starfleet a consistently very high moral ground throughout the franchise.The re-booted Starfleet, however, is nothing at all like this. Regulations are routinely treated as if they were written for the specific purpose of being ignored or outright violated. The Federation's Prime Directive, not to interfere in the development of younger civilizations, is treated by ""Into Darkness"" as if it's just some pesky playground rule that has no business stopping Kirk and his gang from doing whatever they want - and the senior admiralty seems to feel the same way! Orders are issued and routinely ignored. A commanding Fleet Admiral makes a personal decision to destroy one of Starfleet's finest capitol ships to cover up a ""mistake"" (his word) that he made, and nobody in his entire crew seems to have the thought occur to them that hmm, it might be wrong to go along with the admiral's decision to unilaterally murder the entire crew of the other ship.Senior officers who, in the old Starfleet, took their responsibilities to their crew and the Federation very seriously, now seem to have a very difficult time thinking about anything other than finding their next bed partner. (There's a scene where Alice Eve strips down to her underwear in front of Kirk, but the story gives no reason whatsoever for her to do this. They're not even sleeping together! She just takes off her clothes for no reason, and then the story abruptly, bewilderingly moves to the next scene. Don't get me wrong, she looks great, but it's one of the most gratuitous, badly written scenes that I can recall seeing.)So while Into Darkness is visually very impressive (especially with the 3-D), it still profoundly fails in its understanding of what the 23rd/24th Centuries are supposed to be all about in the Star Trek universe. It IS possible, after all, to still make a JJ Abrams movie while keeping the moral high ground that Starfleet was always so good at in the past. But this sure didn't happen with Into Darkness.I give it a 4/10 - and that's being very kind.",Star Trek Into Darkness
675,PeriSubhash,"""To boldly go where no man has gone before""",8,11 May 2013,"Director J.J. Abrams brings yet another adrenaline-filled sci-fi movie to the big screen. Abrams once again proves himself in each technicality of the reboot he took up of this wonderful franchise which erstwhile film makers couldn't work on. The previous 11 Star Trek were all good to watch nevertheless the TV series were way better, but this latest Star Trek movie is surely the best of all. This is a decent reboot for the franchise. So ""Set your phasers to stun!""True to Abram's panache, at 132 minutes, this film is fairly long. There wasn't a moment where u'll feel that the movie was lagging. The cast's performance was impressive. Explorers as they are (in role), the characterization of each role were exemplary.Talking about the movie cast - more screen sharing time for each character not unlike the previous one, the antagonistic KHAN portrayed by Benedict Cumberbatch (the guy from SHERLOCK) was the one I loved a lot. Cumberbatch has nailed his character and I loved every frame in which he was present.The growing bond of friendship between Kirk and Spock was handled very well. The 3D effects were just awesome, and well executed. Film score by Michael Giacchino was fitting well in every scene.

676,trc4849,Terrible creative decision with tragic results,4,19 May 2013,"Let me begin by saying this film could have been a 7 or an 8 were it not for a shockingly bad creative decision by the director. I'm talking about artificial lens flares. After complaining to a friend about how incredibly annoying it was, he informed me that the first movie had the same problem...and that is was a problem because it spawned a worldwide backlash with fans asking ""WTF""? So why would the director do it again when it was universally hated the first time around? Arrogance? Maybe we can look forward to Jar Jar Binks in the new Star Wars movies since J.J. doesn't seem to care what annoys a huge portion of this fan base. No one is out there saying ""Wow, I love those lens flare. They made the movie!"" But had I seen the first, and assuming they were as bad, I wouldn't have seen the second.

677,VonDunker,Excellent Twists and Turns,10,22 May 2013,"This movie took ALL Trek mythology, flipped it ups side down and SQUASHED it with ABSOLUTE precision. Excellent job! Cast was Great. Karl Urban stole the show as always - Spot On Good Sir, with a close second by both Anton Yelchin and Zoe Saldana. Yes, the leads were great, but they are the cake. These 3 make the icing on the cake. FX were Fab - I don't know how you guys did it, but just Fab. And Benedict Cumberbatch was better than anyone could ever hope for. Even his running style was Amazing - many actors forget body acting and just do dialog. His acting was quite rich and a delight to watch. A little disappointed that Sikh Actors were not EVEN considered for the role. As Global as Trek is and considering some of the incredible talent coming out of Bollywood, I am disappointed that none were considered. Just a simply tip for April Webster & Alyssa Weisberg – in the future, before you cast the greatest villain of all time - read the character description and at least try to find a quality actor that meets the qualities first. Cumberbatch is going to be fabulous - sincerely, I believe that in my gut - zero doubt you made an EXCELLENT choice. But you didn't even try, which is totally shocking considering how much effort you went through finding Yelchin and Cho. Why is any of the character description important? Because everyone knows that the Khan character gains his self-righteous attitude from the chemical disaster at Bhopal. The character does not just suffer from delusions of grandeur and superhuman strengths, much less a dedication to his ""crew,"" but from a deeply emotional scar and outrage at the death of 20,000 people and world leaders that stood by and did nothing - even less than nothing - since it is still toxic there. It's why the guy tried to take over the world with his bad buddies in the first place. They thought they could run the world better than the Yes-man politicians that cater to modern conglomerates. In order to accurately Twist and Turn future movies, the inherent depths and insanity of the character have to be understood and register. That's Why casting is Everything. Like Karl Urban, Bennedict Cumberbatch is going to nail it and he's going to keep on Wowing us - just fabulous acting at its best. But as casting agents, you simply had a chance to honor the people that died and what their deaths stood for – because that is where the core of Khan's ""end-justify-the-means"" attitude comes from. The ""Supermen"" of his time tried to ""give the world order"" in a time when corporations had more power than politicians...sound familiar? Besides, why do you think the entire ""going with out air"" thing (atmosphere) was so important in both the episode and movies? Remember at all times, Twist and Turn all you want, but Roddenberry had a message and that can't be changed. Over-all, I'm supremely happy with acting, the arc and the story- boarding. I recommend it to Everyone! Thank you cast and crew for all the hard work. Can't wait for more!!!P.S. Sikh's are AMAZING as a religion. Back in the 60's, when the episode was created, the idea of what a Sikh was, much less how to present one without body hair AND with cut hair, was simply too impossible to realize. Even today, I am not certain how one, as an actor, would do it, yet that is just as important to the character's insanity as anything else is. Khan, as a ""superhuman"" with Great intellect, would do even the smallest of things with Great deliberation. And while Hair status is small by our standards, it is HUGE by Sikh standards. The psychological trauma of cutting his hair would simply be a different layered scar as equal to his insanity as anything else. Many modern Sikh's that cut their hair in order to adapt, either end up suicidal later or die of heart failure (a broken heart). It is very sad, and I, for one, encourage them in their beliefs because it keeps them healthy on levels we can't even begin to imagine.Just as I view ""Skin-heads"" as deeply troubled Jewish people that have taken on the false mantel of Delilah, the Khan character's hair status ""SCREAMS"" insanity. The Abram's crew had a wonderful opportunity, and while they did not miss the boat - by sheer presence of the Great Acting - they may fail to make the true deep connection to ST mythology.Actually, when you think about it, this lack in understanding Sikhs - much less one gone Rogue - is the Greatest failing in the understanding of WHY the 60's and 80's audience ""LIKED"" and ""RESPECTED"" the Khan character as much as the Kirk and Spock characters did. Khan walked out of one century and applied his skills and response to an old threat into the new century - failing to realize that all the old problems of money, big business, etc had been solved. It was simply an opportunity. If they are smart, they will develop the background story in future movies. And while they cannot change the actor - that would be adding insult to injury AND he was phenomenal - they could conceivably add a side-kick character from Khan's 72 bunch that enriches the depth and dimensions required.Honestly, they should just hire me. If you walk yourself into a BLIND alley, you need a Whirling Dervish to get you out. LololooBut Seriously...",Star Trek Into Darkness

679,hammerbro82,Good for newcomers; great for Trekkies,9,9 July 2013,"As with the previous movie in this 21st-Century revision of the 23rd Century, the performances by Zachary Quinto (young Spock) and Karl Urban (Bones) are outstanding representations of the original characters as their younger, more emotional selves. Zoe Saldana (Uhura) and Simon Pegg (Scottie) do a good job with their parts even if they seem to have made the characters their own. Chris Pine (Kirk) plays the part with more sexual magnetism and drive than Shatner did (incredibly) but with far less charm. I expect we will see more smooth operating as Kirk begins to age. Benedict Cumberbatch offers a dramatic rethinking of Khan at every level. Though it was interesting, the dramatic change in Khan's character was noticeable, and the age of the character should have been older as he would have been the same age in this reality as in the previous time line. However, the reversal of roles at the reactor chamber was masterfully done. Watching Quinto and Pine reenact this classic scene from ""The Wrath of Khan"" will give you chills. It was beautifully done, and faithful down to the facial expressions. So, although the somewhat more emotional, younger characters will appeal to the younger audiences or those new to the Star Trek universe as pure action, the faithful re-imagination and execution of moving scenes from a past/future that no longer exists is sure to draw appreciation from even hardcore Trekkies.",Star Trek Into Darkness

From the word go there were high expectations of the Star Trek crew to pull off an adaptation of the original television series, to impress current fans whilst also gaining more. The first film was a definite success, showing Captain Kirk as a reckless young man full of spirit. In 'Star Trek Into Darkness' this depiction fades very slightly and we see Captain Kirk's courage much more obviously and his will to do anything to ensure his crew's security. Khan, I felt, was a perfect villain. Matching Captain Kirk in many key area's of their personalities, he creates a great friction between the characters and is almost a mirror image of Captain Kirk which is extremely interesting to watch. The CGI effects, as always, were outstanding. The whole film was alive and buzzing keeping the suspense tight and the power at full.

My only quibble is that Mr. Spock seems to now be written as more of a fussy tight-a** - he's so much that way it stretches being ""logical.""

This lady is so pretty it feels like she ain't fightin' fair; every time I think of her I want to run down to the theater and see it again. But it lends believability, actually - why would men go on five-year space missions? With her on board, all questions are resolved.

683,Misterniska,A Trip Into Darkness,7,7 January 2014,"With ""Star Trek Into Darkness"" J.J. Abrams directs his second Star Trek movie following Star Trek (2009). In comparison to the first movie it is clearly visible that the crew of the Enterprise now know each other better. In the first movie they had to introduce all characters to each other, explain how everyone got to being aboard Enterprise etc. In this movie this is no longer necessary and the film can therefore concentrate on its plot.WARNING: SPOILERS! PLOT The plot is definitively more sophisticated than in the first movie. In the first movie a Romulan traveled back through time to revenge on Spock and after the destruction of Vulcan faces Kirk and Enterprise in an epic space battle. Although a similar space battle is also fought in ""Into Darkness"" this time the storyline is more complex. This time the distinction between good and bad is blurred - in both antagonists (Khan, Admiral Marcus). For example, Khan's motive is not only revenge but also fear for his crew and this is what motivates his actions and lets the viewer sympathize with ""the bad guy"". Admiral Marcus, in contrast, at first seems like a (slightly) militant Admiral (but not a foe) until it is revealed that he has built a secret starship and wants to apprehend Khan at all cost (e.g. ordering Kirk to fire torpedoes at Khan's location on the Klingon homeworld,and his fight against Enterprise when Kirk doesn't hand over Khan to him).Although I liked the plot structure in General (Nibiru Mission - assaults on earth - Enterprise's hunt of Khan - and final confrontation with both Khan and Marcus) there were some moments that I didn't like very much.1) Enterprise hiding under the surface of the ocean on Nibiru - This was simply illogical and only written into the plot because of the ""cool"" effect of the Enterprise emerging from the water. Why didn't they simply stay in orbit in order to remain undetected by the prewarp civilization? 2) The ""Wrath of Khan"" reference in the end - When Kirk enters the room with the lethal Radiation in order to get Enterprise's engines back online I already knew that this was meant to be a homage to Star Trek II. The only difference is that in this movie Kirk ""dies"" and Spock stands at the glasdoor, talking to his captain for the supposedly last time. The dialogue sequence was almost exactly copied from ""The Wrath of Khan"". It felt like an (over)dramatic broad hint to fans of the ""old"" movies. A bit less would have been more, at least in this case.3) Saving Kirk with the superhuman blood of Khan - Of course it was clear that Abrams couldn't let Kirk die (because he's an essential part of the Enterprise crew and because of future movies)but the solution with Khan's blood came a bit too quick. Bones sees the tribble move, and seems to synthesize a cure from Khan's blood without any difficulties.CHARACTERS KIRK - Kirk has certainly developed since the first movie - he seems a better captain than in the first movie (caring for his Crew, also questioning orders given by superior if they are ethically / morally wrong). However, he still tends to do unnecessary (stupid) things such as hiding Enterprise under the ocean and trashing Khan on Kronos (he should know that this is pointless - it won't bring Admiral Pike back to life)--- good performance by Chris Pine SPOCK - Qunito better adopts Spock's cool logic than in the first movie. Spock reacts rationally but - when Kirk ""dies"" - he also Shows his human side (much more than the ""old"" Spock) by crying and furiously shouting a certain name. BUT: When he pursues Khan on earth, he even adopts Kirk's bad thrashing attitude - by beating Khan almost to his death until Uhura stops him.BONES - Urban Plays Bones both in his traditional grumpy way known from the original series but also with his very own humour.SCOTTY - Fortunately more involved in the story line and not only as comic relief. He even saves Enterprise by sabotaging Admiral Marcus's ship and helping Kirk to secure the bridge. Nice Scottish Accent by Pegg;-) ADMIRAL MARCUS - good Performance by Weller. However, he somehow diminishes to a secondary antagonist in comparison to Khan.KHAN - Cumberbatch's charismatic acting really makes Khan the strongest character in the movie. Cumberbatch's voice really sounds very threatening and he masters both emotional scenes (in his cell on Enterprise)and fighting scenes very well. It is great to see Khan as a multidimensional character and not a one-dimensional-revenge character (compare Nero from 2009's Star Trek).CONCLUSION: 7/10",Star Trek Into Darkness
684,chuckedoll,"Underrated, character driven, and unfairly maligned",10,10 August 2018,"I am a lifelong Star Trek fan. I love the two JJ Abrams films and enjoyed the third part. This film, like the first one, is not like Star Trek. It does, however, understand the dynamics of the characters. This films work like more action oriented episodes of the show such as ""the doomsday machine"" or ""balance of terror"". Those looking for heavier themes like those featured in ""The City on the Edge of Forever"" should look elsewhere.
This film is one the greatest adrenaline rush thrill rides I've ever seen, along the lines of an Indiana Jones film. Cumberbatch and Weller work outstandingly as the villians. Pine, Quinto and the rest of the cast do and outstanding job and act as the real backbone of the story once again. This film deserves another chance and never should be lumped in with the majority of bad reboots. This is one of the good ones.",Star Trek Into Darkness
685,teasippingnerdymom,"Masterful editing, excellent humor, great characters, but the women need pants by now. Its an alternate timeline!",8,21 August 2016,"Now I know that Trek fans are going to have to cope with parallels and alternate plot flows as this universe is a skewed reality (a concept that is probably best described by Dr. Brown in Back to the Future II), but this Khan was just not the same at all. Cumberbatch was done a bit of a disservice by this because he is otherwise amazing.Cumberbatch was a seriously good villain, but he's just not Khan. There is no similarity in speech patterns or movement styles. You can see the original characters in the new actors. Cumberbatch was great, and what a rich voice! His acting was brilliantly chilling and mesmerizing, but he should have been an entirely different villain. Montalbom's Khan was just too defining. In ST:II he was driven by grief and anger over the death of his wife. He lived and loved. This was not the same character.My other gripes: the women are still in skirts (WHY? Its not the 60s anymore) and the STUPIDLY pointless Markus ""bikini"" shot. Why was she undressing? Kirk was not accompanying her to the planet. It was an idiotic, pathetic scene. Overall, I found Markus a bit distracting and not overly necessary. I understand her significance in alternate-timeline Kirk's life, but I would have rather had Christine Chapel (pardon any misspellings). The Markus thread watered things down a bit. The original crew could have easily accomplished what she did in the film.Now that that's out of the way, this movie was pretty awesome. Very strong plot threads and character development, which is hard to do since the original Trek had three seasons to develop these characters. We have two movies, and the journeys of the various characters were great. I did not want this movie to be ST:II, but I did like the parallels in this version. Now, sadly, Kirk in this one did not defeat Khan with his intellect. In ST:II, Kirk was up to the challenge of wits. But, of course, he was older in that version. His experience was so much broader. So I will allow the lack of tech smarts Kirk showed in this one.Sulu and Chekov are getting a bit lost in the shuffle, sadly, but I think Abrams did his best to give them some significance to the plot. McCoy has his amusing metaphors and constant fretting, Chekov and his accent get their moment of heroics, Sulu gets to sit in the chair for a brief period, and Scotty gets a serious increase in screen time from the first film which is a major plus. Saldana has always been a worthy presence in this male-driven series. She holds her own with integrity as well as femininity. I thoroughly enjoyed her breakout performance in the first and again appreciate her continued strength in this second Trek installment. Greenwood and Weller are also fantastic.Kirk was portrayed with strength, charisma, and surprising yet refreshing vulnerability. Pine's casting has been pure perfection in both films.James T. Kirk: I have no idea what I'm supposed to do, I only know what I can do!The chemistry delivered between Kirk the other actors/characters is flawless. It fits with each different personality and situation he encounters. I especially loved when he turns to Khan, who's been smugly poking about how he knows all the answers, and Kirk just lets him have it with such intensity not only in his voice but also in his eyes.James T. Kirk (to Khan): Let me explain what's happening here: you are a criminal! I watched you murder innocent men and women! I was authorized to END you! And the only reason why you are still alive is because I am allowing it. So SHUT YOUR MOUTH!Damn.Klingons come out to play! They had a very good tribal look. It made sense for their primal-driven society (as I look at them with the eye of someone who loves studying ancient history). I liked their look in this film. And, of course, you cannot have Klingons and Kirk without Tribbles. Fantastic little plug.The action: Wow. When Spock and Khan are running between vehicles? Holy wicked fight choreography. Khan handing a squad of Klingons their butts? Holy smokes. Of course, there were bloodier beatings than I would have preferred. Made me cringe a little. But while the action and fights were intense, it was all very true to the characters. Space battles – the FX are gorgeous eye candy!The musical score was very well done. It enhanced the moods to a ""T."" It helped build plot points and gave the film a smooth flow. Of course, the main theme, which rises, literally, when the Enterprise does, is always one that gives me goosebumps of awesomeness.I also want to give props to the editors who pieced this film together. Transitions between people and places are done to keep up the suspense and intensity but also move things along seamlessly. Everything fit together quite harmoniously at a break-neck speed that is immensely compelling and somehow never jarring.To again comment on the humor: Perfection. It really enhanced the character relationships. The chemistry with Spock was powerful. All this really helps transition fans from the originals to this new cast. You see the long-standing relationships that fans are used to, but it also works for new fans unfamiliar with Trek. There is enough spunk and subtle quirks that define these characters to make them familiar to old fans and still delightfully unpredictable.Star Trek: Into Darkness combines visual wizardry with a compelling/clever narrative and multidimensional characters with a Next Gen-like team spirit. The ideas of friendship, family, and humanity are woven through this movie with subtle perfection. A truly spectacular, inventive, and unpredictable voyage. I might as well just give Abrams my wallet. I will be going back for more again and again!",Star Trek Into Darkness
686,milesnorth,Boldly Going To Greatness!,8,31 January 2017,"SPOILER WARNING I'm probably going to say this a couple times, but here we go. This movie is great. The new take on Khan is amazing, as it really highlights the war criminal part of his character. Instead of being cheap and copying Wrath of Khan, it took one of the best sci-fi villains of all time and used him in a new and compelling story. The plot twists are a bit predictable, but that doesn't change the fact that they're great. The death of Pike gives Kirk a personal reason to hate Khan, although it doesn't really make the viewer emotional (they didn't develop the bond between Kirk and Pike properly). Overall, it is a great movie, and I urge you to ignore the critics and watch it!",Star Trek Into Darkness
687,swamper777,Orci and J.J. Abrams plunges the genre back into darkness,2,5 September 2013,"I recently read that screenwriter Bob Orci has lashed out against fans who gave their honest opinions of this movie. To wit, he said, ""As I love to say, there is a reason why I get to write the movies, and you don't."" He claimed that the most recent addition to the Star Trek genre was ""infinetly more social commentary than Raiders of the Lost Ark in every Universe.""I am SO glad Orci managed to best (in his own mind, anyway) a thirty- year-old film. In our minds, however, the correct answer is, ""NOT!"" I don't know know which audience he thinks he's writing for, but it certainly isn't the average moviegoer, much less the Trekkies. His is a clear failure of lesson number one: Consider the audience. Even though I've seen every movie and show from all five of the TV series, I don't consider myself a Trekkie. Just a well-versed aficionado of the genre.Additionally, the screen direction managed to do what Cameron's Avatar succeeded in avoiding: Making the audience ill. Seriously, the in- your-face closeups combined with whatever degenerative neural disease on the part of those working the camera made for an extremely unpleasant theater experience. Excessive closeups and spastic camera work utterly destroyed what might have been some very good visuals, acting, and possibly an otherwise decent script. So, FAIL.",Star Trek Into Darkness
688,rjhill33,Absolutely Brilliant,10,22 May 2013,"As a true Star Trek fan, I was so amazed by the twists in this movie that I could only fathom the word ""brilliant"" to describe it. The plot villain was a true SURPRISE for me, and everyone else, and the story twist was perfect, playing off of what is my favorite movie out of the original six Star Trek movies. If you are a true fan of the original series of movies made between '79-'91, then you will completely appreciate this movie, and the twists it brings forth. J.J. Abrams played this so cleverly, my mind is still processing how they came up with story line modifications, and how amazing it really was. It is hard to discuss the movie without giving away who/what the plot is, and how it all comes together. Needless to say, if you know ALL the characters from the original series of movies(not just the main cast, you'll have to dig a little deep in your memory for some surprises), you will love the twist and have complete appreciation as to how the new alternate reality has not lost itself from the original series. I have seen a lot of the so-called ""purists"" claiming how bad the new ST movies are, but to me they are no different than people who eat caviar...just snobs faking they have knowledge of finer things when they really don't, because what they are eating really tastes like crap. My advice, get over yourselves, purists, and start appreciating the brilliance of what they are doing with the newly revitalized Star Trek storyline and enjoy it as much as the rest of us! Score 12/10 ...two thumbs up and an around-the-world snap! Well done, JJ...well done~",Star Trek Into Darkness
689,harold_a_shaver,Reboot Epic Fail,3,11 September 2013,"I am going to try and write a review without giving too much away for those who have not yet sat through this lifeless reboot.Having literally grown up as a defacto member of Star Fleet I was very disappointed in this JJ ABRAMS concoction. While realizing that we are nearly a half century since we first encountered ST cruising the galaxy dealing with new life forms and civilizations and our own human frailties and virtues and there would be needed changes and adjustments.The core of ST has always been the cohesion of the crew...the fact that we as associate members of Star Fleet could identify with the crew and share what was happening on screen. This newest installment takes liberties with the script. I remind you that I am trying to give input without spoiling . There is the need to build upon the past but not to take bits from the scripts and just flip them around ..we needed new story lines not revamped works. I agree that after Nero ST needed to develop a villain that could get some mileage....this was achieved in this movie but without the energy and conviction of ..lets say Khan from ST2. The franchise is not junked and can recover in the next installment but we need to care about the crew as much as the story line. Zach Quinto is too robotic as Spock. He is lacks the subtle human projections that were key , in Nimoy's creation, that built allowed the friendship to be build between Kirk and McCoy.Until Quinto can bring this to his work...ST will fall flat.",Star Trek Into Darkness

691,carina-reyes,"Excellent, entertaining, fix casting",8,26 May 2013,"I want to begin that this Star Trek is one of the best ones done thus far which is why I'm giving it a 8/10. Excellent story, writing, humor and powerful acting across the crew. It seems the producers and directors went through painstaking casting for the core crew. Zachary Quinto is a spitting image of Leonard Nimoy and Chris Pine is very close to the young William Shatner-- he was quite the looker back in the day. Hence I am puzzled as to why the casting mgr would choose a blue-eyed white guy to represent the superiorly genetically engineered race when these are prequels to past Star Trek stories. We all know Khan was of some type of South Asian descent, with an eternal tan, played by Ricardo Montalban with amazing flair and princely dictatorial command. While the fellow who played Khan was indeed outstanding, the trekkies who have seen the Wrath of Khan are sorely disappointed. Seems a bit discriminatory. It's like when Hollywood casted a white guy to play GOKU. This seems a reversal of the past when Mickey Mantel played a Japanese guy quite ridiculously in Breakfast at Tiffany's. Seriously Hollywood, I thought you set the bar on this and Star Trek being one of the most incredible TV and movie examples of the diversity inclusion. It would have been a 10 in my book if the casting had been more accurate. Can you imagine if they had made young Spock black, James T Kirk Asian...one would hear some major screaming? The India fellow in TV show Hero would have been perfect.",Star Trek Into Darkness
692,KirstenVerdel,JJ Abrams killed Star Trek,1,8 June 2013,"JJ Abrams killed Star Trek. There, I said it. This wasn't a Star Trek movie, this was a Star Wars movie. JJ Abrams, who is also making the next Star Wars movie, apparently had the plots for the two movies mixed up. Whereas Star Trek is about human development, about humanity, exploring, complicated issues that are mainly resolved by thinking and arguing, Star Wars has always just been some shootouts in space. Don't get me wrong: I like action movies every now and then, especially in a Sci-Fi setting. I watch Star Wars as well.But like I said: this is not supposed to be Star Wars. This is Star Trek. After the first 'new' Trek movie I wanted to give the creators the benefit of the doubt, but I was wrong. I could have known: the setup in the previous movie was like in every superhero movie these days: introduction of characters, background stories, introduction of some bad guy, a few fights, person/country/planet/universe saved. Second movie: worse bad guy(s), bigger fights, more explosions, BIGGER EXPLOSIONS, something saved again.This was a formula movie. Another one. Movie theaters are flooded with them. The Hangover III, Fast and Furious V, Iron Man III, Scary Movie V, and that's just what's playing in theaters here in Holland *right now*. Please please... somebody save Star Trek. Gene Roddenberry would have HATED this movie. It's everything Star Trek is nót about.Boy do I miss Picard and Sisko.",Star Trek Into Darkness
693,SanitariumLXIX,"Good, But.......",7,18 May 2013,"I enthusiastically loved the first J.J. Abrams Star Trek movie, even with all of the whining naysayers and fanboys claiming that he ruined Trek forever. While I still think those naysayers have been drinking too much Romulan Ale, I must say that after seeing this movie I'm starting to see what they meant...just a little.Don't get me wrong here; I really liked most of this movie. So much so that I will see it a few more times in the theater as I did with the last one. But, I do have some gripes about it, and I'm still trying to figure out if they're major or minor.Let's start with what I did like: First, I love how the new cast (Pine, Quinto, Saldana, Urban, Pegg, Cho, Yelchin) have settled into these old characters. They're portrayals are fresh, yet familiar. And their interactions are very reminiscent of their predecessors. Second, the plot is much easier do absorb. Unlike the last movie, where everything was shown to us at almost breakneck speed, this story is slowed down just a tad, allowing for a more organic flow and more screen time for the ""minor"" main cast characters (Sulu, Chekov, Scott). Also, less lens flares! Abrams really listened to the fans on this.Now, for my gripes, and here's where the spoilers come in: The story starts with a bang, but slowly starts becoming predictable, and at times really silly. Unless you've gone into this completely spoiler free, you've figured out by now that Benedict Cumberbatch is really Khan Noonien Singh. I didn't mind this. In fact, I loved the almost Hannibal Lecter way he played Star Trek's signature villain. What I didn't like was the lack of originality in the third act. A key scene from The Wrath of Khan is almost photocopied into the climax, and while it was going for an emotional punch, it wound up being almost laughable. In fact, it's painfully obvious how it becomes resolved. Also, I audibly groaned when the writers brought back **** (I won't say who. This review has enough spoilers) to explain how Khan operates to the understandably ignorant crew.All in all, this movie is bordering on solid. Just an average Trek. But, I think it will be enjoyed by fans and non fans alike. I haven't seen it in IMAX 3D yet, so that's something to look forward to.",Star Trek Into Darkness
694,cliffo-1,Star Trek: Into Brainless,7,27 May 2013,"As I said on my way out from the theater, ""Well, I didn't hate it"". On the good side, I liked the character development of a more humble Kirk (though it was pretty heavy handed). I liked Khan's character overall.I have some technical issues and plot issues with this movie that kept me from loving it.Technical Issues First: 1 - A free fall from space toward Earth would result in *ZERO* gravity. Instead we get the dramatic but dumb tumbling gravity everyone going every direction scene. Maybe simulating zero G would have been too expensive given the budget constraints(? as if there were budget constraints here). 2 - Why does every space movie have sound effects of objects whizzing by in space? NO AIR = NO SOUND! There are more, these were the big ones that stick in my mind.Plot Issues: So, an inside agent blows up a library (aka super secret research center). Within hours (minutes?), Star Fleet figures out and declares war against the prime suspect (Khan). Then Khan shows up and starts shooting everything that moves then beams himself to the Klingon home world. He didn't kill everyone, just some people, really just one character that we know. Seems pretty ham handed for a guy like Khan. Then, while Kirk is off to seek vengeance, we learn that the top admiral of Star Fleet has a secret base with a giant ship built to kill Klingons apparently...and this is why Khan blew up the library and made an assassination attempt on Star Fleet top brass? But then Khan beams to the Klingon world and kills Klingons to save Kirk...because Kirk is a man of conscience? Oh, and at the end, the dreadnought ship CRASHES INTO AND DESTROYS MOST OF London! Meh, at least they got the bad guy. No need to dwell on the cost of life involved.I guess my feelings are that this movie is a mix of being a really simple, heavy handed, and incomplete morality play combined with hints of what could be a very complex and unexplored and ignored plot. I didn't hate it but I don't love it either.If, at the end of what I assume will be a trilogy, Star Fleet emerges as the enlightened version that we know of from the original Roddenberry vision then my whole attitude toward these two movies will shift. For now, it's just not there for me.Any why does the Enterprise have a giant beer distillery in it?",Star Trek Into Darkness
695,dbilyewzip,This movie is a tribute to Roddenberry's intent,10,18 September 2013,"I give this movie a TEN rating, and I remember only ONE other movie I rated so highly; I will tell you here WHY. 'Star Trek Into Darkness' 2013 continues the franchise's extreme ability to entertain us with personable characters and action scenes beyond our wildest dreams. But I would like to address the ""inner-core"" theme of this movie: a scenario put forth with such subtlety, but which should give us pause, and hopefully make us think.When I began watching ""Star Trek the series"" 48 years ago, even at 11 years old, I marveled at its intricate ability to relate the ""moral of the story"", and the show's value as a medium for teaching us about ourselves. Since the original series' end in 1968, throughout its installments which have followed for the past 45 years, the writers and producers have maintained the premise of Gene Roddenberry's intent - that premise being Star Trek's underlying ability to have deeper meaning, to employ entertainment to address the concerns of the times in our country. Mr. Roddenberry began the tradition of instilling in the Star Trek characters and plots a reflection and upholding of our own ethics, morals and standards of that time, giving us hope that our very own core values would be preserved, and continue on into the distant future. This holds true in this latest installment, STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS. The parallels laid forth in this movie to today's threats, enemies, and recent events must be heeded, if we are to employ intellect alongside our driving desire to be entertained. Those parallels most obvious are: 1 -- the ""awakening"" of Khan by a power-mad leader, this done for the self-serving motives of this power-mad leader. When the character of Khan states, ""you should have let me sleep"", I could not help but be so aware of our own past ""uses"" for evil characters - we utilizing them to further OUR interests, but eventually having to confront our inability to control that evil we embraced. We would have been better off, had we passed them (and that course of action) by completely.2 -- the character of Scotty demonstrates he is a bit frightened that he has ""committed treason"" against the organization's top leader (the very leader who's sanity is now in question). Though we can agree that he is correct in his action to lend help in averting the events unfolding, he knows that he would be persecuted and prosecuted for treason for those actions. This makes one ask, ""is there a time when treason IS justified""? What if the person(s) in power were threatening the survival of the rest of us?3 -- then, who could miss the stupendous scene where the totally brand- new re-designed USS star-ship -- a monstrosity built strictly and primarily for military use, a drone ship capable of being manned by one person, if necessary, and happens to be manned by that madman-leader's ""finger on the trigger"" -- is targeting those high-rise buildings we know are full of people at the time? And the ""evil awakened"" is the one directing that ship into those buildings.This movie truly explores the theme of the dangers of a military leader with too much power, the deception and secrecy practiced by that leader, the eventual lengths to which he is willing to go, promoting the real possibility of a military ""run a-muck"". Anyone who looks past the wonderful new-age computer graphics, and the high-tension action scenes we live for, MUST then see not only the ever-present theme that good wins over evil - but look further. We see the details of HOW we win, by honoring those so-necessary ethics, morals and values within ourselves. It is important to our way of life to win against our enemies, but it is important for our souls that we do so in a way in which we maintain what made us great.And the parting message, which highlights the last parallel to our present-day conflicts in this country, says it all so well. Pay, then, attention to the words of the final speech of the movie - which say:""There will always be those who mean to do us harm; To stop them, we risk awakening the same evil within ourselves. Our first instinct is to seek revenge, When those we love are taken from us.But that's not WHO WE ARE . . ."" There is a . . . ""Call for us to remember Who we once were, and who we MUST BE again."" If you've not yet seen this movie, see what you think. And if you've watched the movie - watch it again, and look at it in a new light.",Star Trek Into Darkness
696,Tyger-Flynn,Not For The Serious Science Fiction Fan,3,18 May 2013,"Huge disappointment. Shallow fare. I realize this is a derivative film - but while the first one of this re-cast was a clever re-spin, factoring in a changed time-line - and hence suggesting intriguing possibilities for all future story-lines - this film is a re-hash, making the past banal. I was bored by the time the dying character appeared on the screen - and that was pretty early on in the film.All smash-bang with inordinate moments of 'meaningful feeling' - what a waste. Where was the character driven story? This could have been so much better given the outstanding beginning made with the very good 2009 ""Star Trek"".

697,n_peart_2112,So disappointed,2,3 June 2013,"I waited Four years for this? To Begin as to why I felt this was the most disappointing moment in my cinematic history since Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, I feel I must work at this chronologically in list format...1) The first Star Trek movie went to the trouble of creating a new story in an alternate timeline which in my opinion was to avoid needing to follow continuity of the original series and maybe have some new ideas. So why have a new idea for the first if all that will comprise the sequel is a wrath of khan remix? 2) What is with the constant need to make Spock a human? I understand the desire to give him some emotion, but I believe they went in excess on this one. He rarely seems to be the Spock we know who has a good dose of Vulcan moments as well as human moments.3) The tongue in cheek references to Wrath of Khan got to be a little much. At first it was an attitude of ""oh thats interesting, they're referencing Wrath of khan"" to ""Okay are you serious!"" even right down to the point where Kirk and Spocks spots are reversed and Kirk dies, only to have Spock Shout ""KHAAAAAAAAN!!! This part drew more laughter than any kind of emotional release from the audience. Drawing on nostalgia to hold the fan's attention is a sign of laziness and poor scripting.4) The resurrection of kirk was incredibly anti climactic. There was an entire movie devoted to Spock's resurrection in The Search for Spock, but here, we are treated to a deus ex machina solution of using Khan's ""Super blood"" to bring Kirk back.5) Another inclusion of leonard nimoy was contradictory to what happened in the last movie. Old Spock told new spock that he could not count on interference with their lives or destinies, and just because Khan rears his head again, he decides to overrule his previous conviction and tell the enterprise just what they're dealing with. If Old Spock truly didn't want to have that responsibility, why does new spock seem to just have old Spock on Speed dial? Old spock should have just disapeared from the galaxy and never contacted the enterprise again. "" To boldly go where no man has gone before""?, try ""To casually go where everyone who has seen Wrath of Khan has gone before"" Anyone who truly knows Star Trek should've left this movie in disgust at what the franchise has become. Mr Abrams, your future endeavours with the enterprise are no longer necessary and you shall be where you truly belong in the Star Wars universe, where flashy colors, weak story, weaker dialogue, and fond memories of the better trilogy fed ox office revenue to the garbage prequel trilogy that fell victim to a poor director and a nameless rabble of cronies who told him only what he wanted to hear.",Star Trek Into Darkness
698,terminatorxx,Entertaining but amateurish,7,22 August 2013,"I generally don't like J.J.Abrams. I think he is a phony who thinks he is the king of science fiction. As a science student, I do think sci-fi requires some imagination and some artistic freedom that enables the Writer/Director to create an enchanting tale which while being ""a little"" scientifically inaccurate is enjoyable and often serves as an inspiration to future generations of technology as well as film making. Star Trek Into Darkness does not come into that category. While the story and special effects are engaging enough to keep the audience in their seats, I wonder if the movie was able to keep the viewer's mind of questions like ""Is that possible?"", ""Ohh...Come on..There is no way that could happen. Could it?"". The only experience I have with this franchise is this movie along with its predecessor which was not that great as well. I have seen parts of J.J.Abram's so called sci-fi work like Lost, Super 8, MI 3, Fringe etc. and my conclusion is that he is very bad at science. The blatant use of plot devices that make no sense to any person who may be remotely familiar with science can be seen in his every work. STID is not an exception. Though it suffers from the Director's vision and competence, the film is not repulsive at all. In fact, I felt that I should disregard whatever faults the film carried in order to enjoy the film and I did. Benedict Sherlock does well to portray a dangerous villain. Apart from that acting is mostly average. Incredible things could have been achieved with that budget and a premise such as Star Trek. But, Abrams fails to produce anything original except a few things that help him get out of corners that he writes himself into. See the film if you have an eye for special effects and the British Sherlock. As I said, it is entertaining but amateurish, which is better than most of Abrams work.",Star Trek Into Darkness
699,webspinner128,Fun but unintelligent,7,24 May 2013,"I enjoyed the first film. It was good acting, good action, put together in a clever plot that rebooted the franchise in a respectful, satisfying way. It spent entirely too much time between Earth and Vulcan, but I didn't really miss the philosophy or sense of adventure and discovery, even though these deficiencies are why I don't think one can consider it a ""Star Trek."" This one has some of the same virtues as the first, but falls incredibly short on plot.The action is better than the first, and the chemistry between characters is still there, though the movie suffers from too much focus on Kirk and Spock and not enough McCoy (Karl Urban's DeForest Kelly impression is always the best, mainly because I think it is partly parody) Cumberbatch steals every scene he is in, never acting subtly but never overwrought in his villainy either.But even though I mostly enjoyed it for these reasons, I can't let this film and its weak plotting off the hook. MILD SPOILER ALERT. It continues the ""alternate timelime"" trend, borrowing some of the history of the original. The problem is it doesn't do it very gracefully rather it borrows narrative elements and then alters them in a way that might seem clever at first, but are less so when you think about it. It's like a poet who thinks he or she has a good poem after only making the words rhyme--the symmetry is there, but ultimately it's only fan service that will ironically never please the the folks its trying to.The problem is that the film tries to be original in a way it can't be original. Rather than focusing on a new, smart plot (""going where no ST film has gone before"") it brings together old characters and themes for not other reason than to say ""hey, look its a new version of an old character."" The futility lies in trying to please too many people, and the story suffers. On top of that there is some unnecessary political commentary, apparently trying to please yet another group of people.Oh yeah, and LENS FLARES.",Star Trek Into Darkness

If you haven't by now watched this move, do yourself a favor and don't invest time in it, you will just feel cheated. Nobody can give me back that two hours of mediocrity. This film isn't a parody and that is it's weak point. Unfortunately Mr. JJ did a very good job of destroying every single trace of possible quality. The story couldn't even fill A4 size paper if you try it, with really big letters. At the end we got a typical American war mongering propaganda with every cliché imaginable; from the disappointed daughter to bro-to-bro love. A complete and utter waste of time.",Star Trek Into Darkness
701,sebastiancanes,Bravo J.J. Abrams.,10,26 May 2013,"This movie is by far the best Star Trek movie from the catalog. I am impressed by how this cast embodies the original cast. Today's technology adds a whole new dimension to the Star Trek movies. As a fan of Star Trek, I appreciated the major tie-in to the original movie. Zachary Quinto is phenomenal as Spock. Simon Pegg stole scenes. The relationship between Uhura and Spock, which I was not a fan of at first, is evolving and providing humor and individual development. Finally, Benedict Cumberbatch did an exemplary job portraying Khan. His version will certainly provide a formidable opponent for a future movie.",Star Trek Into Darkness
702,criticwithnoname,"JJ Abrams and writers Roberto Orci, Alex Kurtzman and Damon Lindelof deliver a Star Trek adventure so fun even fundamentalists will enjoy it until the third act.",8,20 May 2013,"The Good: The ""Best of Star Trek:"" In keeping with the elements that made its predecessor ""Star Trek"" a general mainstream success ---barring the fundamentalist naysayers who complain about starships being built on Earth among other things--- ""Into Darkness"" is a salute to the science fiction institution that is Star Trek. In doing this, classic catchphrases, plot points and themes for which Trek is famous are tied into the fabric of the film and are done in such detail that audience members may overlook the fact that this film was produced virtually without a script. Yes, this film was made with a first draft script adaptation of a 70 page story treatment. The writers wrestled with the script so much that they had to delay the film's production by an extra year and had a script that was barely functional enough to film. However, when one takes into account the obvious ""Trek Tributes"" as well as the other ""Easter eggs"" hidden in dialogue and plain sight, this cardinal sin of cinema might be overlooked. From the opening title cards to virtually the credits, ""Star Trek Into Darkness"" catapults itself into the frontiers of adventure and humor creating a fun journey to otherworldly realms with some semblance of a topical message that ties into modern times which is more than what was delivered from the first one.Balancing Action with Character Development: While new additions to the ensemble, such as Dr. Carol Marcus (Alice Eve), are left out in the cold; the classic characters each get their time to shine and grow in this film. Each is done with an acceptable degree of intelligence, except for Uhura (Zoe Saldana) in the third act. The writers took a calculated risk in demonstrating that while the Enterprise crew was brought together at the end of the first film, there's still a little ways to go before they become the famous crew to trek to the stars. This calculation, for all intents and purposes, works. Each senior officer of the Enterprise has their own respective arcs with the biggest belonging to Captain Kirk (Chris Pine) who exchanges some of his reckless tendencies for responsibility when commanding a starship. The filmmakers also bring Kirk and Spock's relationship to the foreground and give it opportunities to grow in a natural way. Again, considering this was done with a shoddy script, this is very commendable and shows the general competency of Abrams and the writers as storytellers. They may not have been able to develop a well-developed script but they understand the mechanics of storytelling well enough to build a serviceable story from a series of action sequences. This is more than can be said about other filmmakers in the action and science fiction genres.Benedict Cumberbatch's Acting: This goes without saying from the Golden Globe nominated ---and definitely future Oscar winning--- actor. Benedict Cumberbatch does a tremendous job portraying the character of John Harrison, a Starfleet operative who turns against the Federation for reasons he finds immoral. Cumberbatch's acting capacity puts his character easily among the greatest villains in Trek mythology. In addition to Urban's McCoy and Zachary Quinto's Spock, Cumberbatch's performance is the best of the film.The Bad (Forgivable flaws): Self-conscious story elements: This is a minor point that audience members may overlook but there are times in this film where Abrams, Kurtzman and Orci provide ""safety hatches"" for the story in order to say ""yes, we know this is silly but please work with us."" One of the most obvious ""hatches"" is conveyed by Scotty (Simon Pegg, ironically through an airlock hatch) about some of the nonstandard capabilities of the Enterprise. Another ""hatch"" is presented by Kirk in his criticism of Dr. McCoy's (Karl Urban) use of metaphors in describing a situation faced by the crew. While on the one hand these ""hatches"" maintain a connection with the audience in saying they acknowledge the potential absurdity of the situation, they also serve as a detriment to the film because it implies that those parts of the film are places that the filmmakers have little confidence. These elements are few and far between, audience members may not catch them all but they're there.The Ugly (Critical flaws in the movie): ""Everything but the kitchen sink"" storytelling: On the surface ""Star Trek Into Darkness"" is a fun space adventure in the spirit of a decent episode of the original series with a budget of $185 million. Beyond the superficial level, however, audience members may be able to see how the storytellers threw every element of the ""Star Trek"" universe that could remotely service the plot, whether they belonged or not. Nowhere is this more evident than in the third act when ""Star Trek Into Darkness"" becomes ""Star Trek Into Plagiarism."" A dramatic plot twist happens in the middle of the movie where friends become enemies and enemies become friends (?) which completely negates the plot's momentum up to that point. From this revelation, all of the originality that was used to build up the plot rapidly collapses as the story shifts gears and ventures into very familiar ""Trek"" territory. This is the part where the 70 page story treatment for the film evidently ran out of gas and forced the filmmakers to retreat into the archetypes of Trek mythology. The ultimate tragedy is the story that was being built up until that point and even some of the genuinely original elements discussed afterwards were building up to a very fascinating story which could have led directly to an epic sequel that would have written itself. There is a fine line between nostalgia and ripping off material and in the third act the filmmakers cross that line in an attempt to capitalize on the supposed brand recognition of the material. The jury is still out as to whether it will pay off.",Star Trek Into Darkness
703,mina_legolas,"An inventive, unpredictable, mesmerising space voyage! Spectacular!!!!",9,9 May 2013,"Truly spectacular, one of those rare amazing, inventive and often unpredictable blockbusters. The acting was great all round, especially Cumberbatch - wow, he was superb. The direction, cinematography and visual effects were all greatly innovative and brilliant; the screenplay fun, often humorous and has a lot of heart for all its characters which are all really well developed. The film has some cliché moments which can't be avoided often with a film this scale however they make use of them well and still pack plenty of surprises. As well as this, despite not being a proper Trekkie myself, some moments gave me goosebumps from the awesomeness from seeing the Enterprise for the first time for example, which greatly honoured the original series. J.J. Abrams' lens flares helped create more realism in a lot of the scenes despite the fact he often overuses of them.The villain was very interesting and the development, dialogue and motivations of his character were very convincing and inventive, Cumberbatch's fantastic acting greatly helped bring this character to life. Also the way he executed his plan showed a lot more cutting edge creativity than especially most modern blockbusters, not to say it's done nearly to the same level of genius but something I haven't felt in a villain's characterisation/acting since The Dark Knight.Overall, a mesmerising film with nice homages to the original series, one filled with heart, grace, innovation, superb characters and acting and some impressive, clever visuals and immersive 3D, one of the only times I can say that. Up there with the 2009 one, not sure which I prefer, possibly the previous one largely due to the more clever story, despite this one having a much better villain, still not sure though. Still a very strongly recommended film, may hit my top 100 simply because how much I was impressed by it. 9/10!",Star Trek Into Darkness
704,lyy1992,"""Star Trek"" into darkness",9,25 May 2013,"Well I saw a lot of critics by Trekkie, but I'm one of the fans. Even though I'm young, I did look back to previous Star Trek movies series, which were filmed with craft model and fake space background, which is considered as ""funny"" for me, anyway I just look on the plots of the movies.This time, Star Trek Into Darkness is a leap of new level of film. I also did expect that they will discover something new in space, well they did a trans-warp warhead in here. My question to all of fellow fans is whether the ""Star Trek"" itself means something for you. Well my answer is the star fleet itself, internal conflicts and undercovered star fleet history is the darkness.This science fiction movie is just an imagination without any action. But this movie is a hybrid. it is a science fiction movie, and is an action movie, and also is a drama movie too! Is like selling different kinds of fruits to different kinds of customers in the same store.Many critics say that the movie shouldn't be like this and like that. But, our life are not as simple as one aspect only. And that is the purpose of movie! To make some stories or legends real and alive! And Star Trek Into Darkness looks real! Both in graphics and plot! You can see, hear, feel the future events are actually happening right in front of you! That's the greatest achievement I ever seen in Star Trek movies as well as movie of the year! if I consider that this movie is a reboot of Wrath of Khan, I should say that this time is not a story but a real experience! It is hard to explain fully with words, but I encourage you (even you are not star trek fans) not to see but to watch it, because the critics are not your opinion. it will be worth 30$ of ticket for you to be able to watch this kind of level of film!",Star Trek Into Darkness
705,greenpower,This is Star Trek alright. It's excellent. Could be sublime though.,9,6 June 2013,"Let me start by saying that I love Star Trek and Science Fiction in general. I re-watched all Star Trek movies more times than I would care to admit. I know, or at least I'm convinced that I know, what Star Trek is about. I loved the Star Trek reboot, first in 2009 and now its sequel Into Darkness.It's all there. The moral dilemma, the friendship theme, the human weakness, the human brilliance, the strong and emotional characters, the philosophical theme. Yes, even the battles, not found in abundance in all Star Trek movies but still an important part of the show, especially in some particular Star Trek movies. Only now, it has better effects and better production value in general.There's verbatim dialog yes, but that's only known to us, the Trekkies, the people who know Star Trek inside out. And, I really enjoyed those moments. It feels good to be back home you know?To the haters I say: I agree with some of your assessments, the film could have been even better, plot-wise, tech-wise. I agree. It could be sublime, it's only great to excellent. But, what about the excellent acting performances? What to say to those special effects? What to say to the twists and turns, and the surprises that keep you glued to the screen not knowing for sure what will happen?This is an extremely fun and entertaining movie. And, it's Star Trek alright. Is it more action-packed and has it more special effects than the average Star Trek fan is used to? Yes. But, it makes sense for this movie in particular to be like that (some original movies were also more action-packed than others).So, give yourself a favor and go watch this movie in the theaters. You will not regret it. Of course, if you are not willing to accept a breath of fresh air, and you're unwilling to make room in your mind to accept this reboot (or any reboot), because it will never be as good as the originals... Well, that's really not the point I have to say. The point, I think, is to go to the movies, have fun, relate to the characters and learn a few things, or at least take something with you that makes you think.Highly recommended. 9/10Certified by long time Star Trek fan.",Star Trek Into Darkness
706,simply-232-561758,One of the Best Star Trek Films,10,11 May 2013,"Already there have been many criticisms of this film likening it to 'Die Hard in Space' well my answer to those critics was that Die Hard was 'Star Trek on Land'. There is also no way to compare it to Die Hard which after just 5 movies is as stale as last weeks bread.It was always going to be difficult to make a Star Trek film that would not alienate, (sorry for the pun), long-time Star Trek fans and also appeal to the next generation, (sorry for that one too), of movie-goers who are not Star Trek fans.This movie seems to have done that quite admirably with tie-ins to the older Star Trek films and TV series.Although the film is over two hours long it seemed a lot less because there was hardly ever a dull moment. Star Trek always needed to be at the cutting edge of any special effects available at the time, so the use of cgi was always going to be needed in abundance. I was long awaiting this movie as it promised to keep the Star Trek story going after a run of almost 50 years. This movie does it better than the awful 'Enterprise' and 'Deep Space 9' TV series which were more likely to have put people off Star Trek for life.Perhaps the people who will complain the most are likely to be Star Trek haters, and also the most critical of Star Trek's avid fans. They are the ones who scrutinise every detail under a magnifying glass. As for me I found the characters to be close to the original ones as possible with just a few differences which are quite acceptable.On the whole I have no qualms in giving this movie the thumbs up and a perfect score of 10 as it ticked almost all the boxes for me. On just a few times when it didn't, I am willing to overlook.",Star Trek Into Darkness
707,jock75,JJ should be banned from touching Star Trek....,2,12 May 2013,"I am a huge Star Trek fan, and really did enjoy the first instalment of this re-boot when it came out a few years ago. So it was with very high expectations that I went to the theatre on Saturday night to see ""Into Darkness"". I saw it in 3-D IMAX.Well, what a disappointment. And it is pretty much completely the fault of the director, Jar Jar Abrams. Abrams is a classic example of someone that got too popular too quickly, as sooner or later his inexperience and immaturity were going to screw it up for him unfortunately, Into Darkness is where he finally messed up (although some might say Super 8 was that film).Basically, Abrams only knows how to make one thing: ""Lost"". Everything else he has done since then has essentially been Lost, re-badged.The style of this one-trick-pony has just become tiresome, and oh so predictable. Injecting drama into everything is hardly the right formula for a sci-fi action flick, but it is like he couldn't help himself.The resulting plot and dialogue was so very lame.I can't remember the exact lines, but let me paraphrase some for you:Kirk: ""Spock! Damn you, why can't you feel any emotions???"" Spock: ""I do Kirk! But I hide them coz my mother died and I was so sad"". Kirk: ""You have always been my bestest friend!"" Spock: ""Don't die Kirk! You are my bestest friend too!""Basically the entire film was ruined with terrible dramatic scenes and tears and just really uncomfortable acting – this definitely ain't how Star Trek should be.Abrams over-played the Kirk-Spock relationship so much I was almost expecting them to have sex. Seriously.And of course there are some completely useless and WTF characters e.g. Dr. Carol Marcus. I know she was in the original, but in this one she basically had no role other than large boobs.Here is praying that Abrams doesn't get to direct the next one.",Star Trek Into Darkness
708,toyoshimad,A Voyage Where All Movies Have Gone Before,7,21 May 2013,"""Star Trek Into Darkness"" is the second installment in the reboot from director J.J. Abrams. As summer ""blockbuster"" movies go, it is entertaining. And like most of these movies, it's slim on story. If not lazy.Abrams and writers Robert Orci and Alex Kurtzman take us for a ride that seems all too familiar. (Spoiler Alert) ""Into The Darkness"" is the third iteration of ""The Wrath of Khan."" No Ricardo Montalban, but Benedict Cumbertbatch as the bio-engineered super human. (Actually, the character Khan first appeared in the original TV series episode 'Space Seed.') I suppose the director and writers can call this film an ""homage."" But this is a reboot of the series, and you'd think the brain trust would find another plot line. Trek fans would probably find the storyline just fine.Kirk (Pine), Spock (Quinto), Dr. McCoy (Urban), Scotty (Pegg), Sulu (Cho), Uhura (Saldana), and Chekov (Yelchin) embody the style and mannerisms of the original series cast (Shatner, Nimoy et al.) even better now. They seem comfortable together. And the writers have brought back much of the humor and banter (for instance, Spock and McCoy) that made the original series fun. To that end, ""Star Trek Into The Darkness"" works. This ensemble cast is sailing at warp speed.Now that the U.S.S. Enterprise has run its course of old story lines, perhaps now, if there is another Abram's Star Trek, their five year mission in space will actually go where no man has gone before.",Star Trek Into Darkness

This film allowed the actors to shine. We also get to see Kirk mature in this movie. I do have a couple of gripes. #1 the change in appearance of the Klingon's and the fact that since they are about to go to WAR so why was there appearance in the movie was small. I assume- thats for the next movie. Next Khan in the original was Asian from my recollection this khan was English even though Spock in the first reboot of the series changed the time line khan with a totally Asian name in my opinion should have stayed Asian. Btw the English khan acting was great. Lastly, the radiation scene was lame. I think they could have developed the Bro-mance differently without all the tears. I think the tears should have come after a few more Star trek reboot movies where kirks and Spock's relationship is more developed(at least for the new fans) following the radiation scene everything was predictable.

JJ Abrams has created not a just a Star Trek film but a true standalone film as well. I should probably add that his description is coming from a STAR WARS fan and so yes this may well be illegal but I actually enjoyed this film a lot! The first movie was entertaining and all, but it fell slightly short with regard to the action and the story and so we all came away from it saying ""great"" but not remembering it. This film still managed to retain the original highlights of the first which we all loved - the acting, the humour and the special effects but added a real feeling o heart to the proceedings which cam from a number of factors: Firstly the acting: Chris Pine was good in the first one but I felt he was trying a little too hard to go from zero-hero. In this one it's easy to identify he's found his character, it feels a lot more relatable and emotional. Zachary Quinto, delivered an awesome performance - which even draws a tear from some at one scene which I won't spoil for the benefit of any who haven't seen the film. Everyone upped their game but none more so than Simon Pegg - who's definitely taken the time to refine his Scottish accent but also his character as Scotty has a more predominant role in this story. But the stand out performance HAS to go to Mr Benedict Cumberbatch: he created a performance in which the audience could, in a way, feel sorry for him at one point - yet still manages but to be incredibly menacing with a villain who people want to see take on Kirk and Spock.The action is on a much larger scale with the battles in space but also on the ground - it's fair to say that the final fight in particular is reminiscent of the scene in attack of the clones when Anakin jumps between speeders, but it a lot more effective as we as the audience feel a lot more involved with that fight due to the raw emotion from the actors and the brilliant fight choreography.The script has been written so much better, so there are a lot less cheesy lines and a lot more decent ones.The only reason as to why this movie got a 9 out of 10 is because for me some characters were lost in terms of why they were there in this movie - Zoe Saldana is a great actress yet, as in the case of the first one, I simply didn't understand why she was there. The same can be said of Karl Urban's McCoy - a character who I'd previously liked in the first one but who struggles to shine in this one other than perhaps the last few scenes.Overall however even if you're no Trekkie - GO AND SEE THIS FILM, it's definitely worth it! And if this is a preview of things to come regarding Star Wars I can say we're in for a treat from Mr Abrams!",Star Trek Into Darkness

I am also a long time fan, having watched every single Star Trek episode (that's all of them, TOS, TNG, Enterprise, DS9, Voyageur) and all the movies as well as many novels. I found this movie better than the first one in 2009. It was funny, fast paced, and well written. Every member of the original crew got a decent amount of air time. My favorite was always Scotty, who at a young age provided a superior example of an engineer to me. In the movie he is allowed to develop much more than the first, finding plenty of action in a pivotal role.Much has already been said in the reviews here, but I wanted to add my own, that as a fan I am excited with where the franchise is headed under the direction of J. J. Abrams.For the people that gave this movie a poor review, I have no idea what planet you are from, and for those that claim to be fans, I seriously doubt it.

I enjoyed the previous Star Trek films as they were more haunting and always made you think. What would you say if you came across alien life species or a hostile race where if the wrong words were said you would be toast in a split second? The dialogue just didn't have enough weight. Past films were more about the monologues and the mystery rather than the action.Also there were just too many scenes that were too unrealistic given the time. All you have to do is look at how things would unfold today to see how far off the mark of how it would happen then.I feel JJ Abrams just didn't put any thought into this as it does not follow the context of Star Trek or how the future would look.

The SFX are good, the direction & development of the characters is interesting so far. However my main complaint is the rehashing of the old TV shows. I am not a fanatic that believes in the ""purity"" or whatever it is called, I have no problem with the alternate time line thing if that is the direction they want to go, I have no problem if the actors want to give characters something new & unique in order to make them their own, But when I am paying $25+ for a movie, I think I should be able to see something more that seems to be just a shiny rip off & rehash of a TV episode.

720,ronindave,Into the Apt Darkness,3,19 December 2013,"WARNING - SPOILERS in this Review!Star Trek Into Darkness is a sequel foray into the rebooted Star Trek universe where Vulcan has been destroyed and the lives of Kirk and Spock have been altered somewhat - for example Kirk being shot directly into the rank of starship captain from raw cadet whereas in the old universe he had to work his way up in the ranks.Into Darkness picks up with Kirk violating the Prime Directive of interfering with the primitive life of an alien world to save an ungrateful Spock whose mission was also a violation of the Prime Directive but whatever... Spock rats out his good friend Kirk who gets demoted but shortly after re-promoted to head a ridiculous kill mission that should have made him suspicious from the get go which was to fire 72 special photon torpedoes at one guy - a guy who somehow teleported himself from earth all the way to the Klingon home world.This one guy is of course Khan which come as no surprise as he is in every trailer of the film which leads you to believe he will be doing all sorts of nasty clever things (spoiler! - he doesn't).Ultimately the problem with Into Darkness is Khan himself. It's like they wrote one story which had to do with a secret group trying to militarize Star Fleet and start a war with the Klingons then they tried to force Khan into this story but it just didn't work and it caused the first idea to unravel. Every aspect about Khan ruins the story. He's a genius but when he gets a chance at revenge he just shoots the heck out of a room and misses his main target. He then teleports himself all the way from Earth to the Klingon homeworld and does nothing until the Enterprise crew shows up.Khan assumes his super friends dead but when he hears the Enterprise has 72 special torpedoes he assumes them to be alive and so he surrenders and spills the beans about the conspiracy to start a war with the Klingons.That's the spoiler twist - Khan is not exactly the bad guy. Another bad guy shows but he is killed by Khan about 20 minutes later and that whole more interesting plot goes out the window as the movie focuses again on Khan as a bad guy who just wants his super friends back. Oh supposedly he is a genocidal maniac who kills others he deems inferior just like he never was in the original series.The movie is a bizarre mishmash of Seeds of Doom, Star Trek II, and VI with very little of it being an original story in its own right. It relies heavily on the old series that it becomes only a pale imitation of it. As for the action, it has a lot of that but it becomes relentless to the point of becoming like a cartoon where the characters survive ludicrously impossible situations.",Star Trek Into Darkness
721,gabrielegreco,A lost opportunity,2,26 June 2013,"I'm sad to give this movie a poor rating.Acting is good, there are some funny dialogues, the special effects are OK, as the 3d usage.The problem is the script. Mostly in the second part of the movie.This movie is not Sci-Fi, it's an action movie, it's nearer to one of the latest episodes of the ""Die Hard"" saga that to one of the ""classic"" or ""tng"" trek movies.There is an evil terrorist, the action is mostly on the earth, Klingons are the only extra terrestial race you see and they have a very minor role in the movie.It seems that the script is written to create some spectacular action scenes, that do not make any logical sense, characters almost never behave in a coherent or logical way, only to support the action.Ship weapons, scanners, security systems, shields, teleports only work when it's useful for the script, the writer forget about them where he needs to...So, very poor script but good acting, Quinto and Pegg over the others, for a movie with a good incipit but that loses itself on the way, to boldly go where no other trek script has gone before...",Star Trek Into Darkness
722,christopherelawrence,"A movie with no taste, and not worthy of the name.",1,12 March 2014,"You know, I believe that the first time that I saw STID was at the Drive-In (after all, where can you see two pictures for a low price nowadays?)and since it was a weekend during the summer, it has always been one of my favorite things to do at that time of year. When the titles of the film came up, I could not help but remember the last time that I had seen the last adaptation, and the confusion that I had with it. Sad to say, I was even more flabbergasted with this one. Now, onto the points: 1. The Enterprise underwater? An intriguing idea, but really not necessary, when it would have made more sense to just have the ship in orbit. 2. The removal of Kirk as Captain of the Enterprise for violation of the Prime Directive. This, of course, was done to give a bit of closure to the lunacy from the first film which gave Kirk command of a starship without the necessary moving up in rank that comes from years of experience (just to move along the story to the point of him having to have command just to be the good guy against the bad guy). Of course, he gets command back in five minutes anyway in this film. 3. The ongoing frittery of the Spock and Uhura dynamic. Was it ever really necessary to introduce a romantic angle? 4. Scotty, Chekov, and the ugly midget. You have to give Scotty credit for not compromising his ethics when it came to the torpedoes, but Chekov as Engineer? He is about as competent as a engineer as he was in the first film as a transporter operator. As for the silent Ewok, he is not a necessary character, and really should be written out(or killed off).And finally, the fifth: John Harrison/Khan and the whole death scene.When ""Harrison"" was first introduced, I was kind of intrigued. A Terrorist attack was something not heard of in the series of movies, even though I did hear that ""Harrison"" would become ""Khan"" eventually. When I finally found myself watching the big ""reveal"", and heard ""My name is Khan."", I quite literally rolled my eyes. There was no impact at all and I wondered why they were going down a road that was done so well before in a greater, superior film. Frankly, as others have said on this site as well as on others, it would have been better to take a different approach and had a villain with different motivations and another background. When the Wrath of Khan came out in 1982, seeing Khan in that film motivated with revenge with a belief that Kirk had done him wrong made sense because Kirk and he had a history together from the episode ""Space Seed"", which included the death of his ambitions as well as his wife (and that was completely absent in STID). The death of Kirk, although noble in this film, made even less sense because of another lack of relationship between Kirk and Spock. Wrath used the relationship of decades to the greatest advantage between the two characters to draw and garner the sympathy and grief needed to make Spock and his death in the original memorable.By the time of the scream of Khan by Spock (which was out of character and ridiculous) the chase and the Magic Blood, I think I was back at the concession stand or in the bathroom.To conclude, the movie itself was yet another bit of confusion because JJ and the writers again ignored Roddenberry and his vision for more flash, action, lens flares, and retreaded/reversed plot-lines just to appeal to people who really do not want to think or appreciate a good concise story.",Star Trek Into Darkness
723,Slurge-5,A Little Too Derivative,7,21 May 2013,"I liked the movie, but would have liked it even more if it wasn't retelling a story we'd already seen—especially one that is considered, by many, to be the best of the original Star Trek films. (And then there was that one scene, albeit ""flipped,"" that was taken directly out of the original film. It made me wince.) However, the cast was great, including the ""guest"" stars, and they were all given some good scenes (except maybe Chekov and Sulu, who got short shrift this time out). What's more, the Klingons stayed off the cutting room floor, and there was plenty of action to go around, so there is a lot to be enjoyed, here. Still, I'm looking forward to something new and original in the next movie.",Star Trek Into Darkness
724,michi-16,Dumb Trek,3,10 May 2013,"*** Contains spoilers ***Saw the film and it was a mixed bag. Effects are great, sound is great, lens flares are everywhere (as expected), story wise it was a let down. Technically Trek never looked better.The enterprise family from the old days (Shatner, Nimoy etc.) worked together very well, dialog was top notch, gags well placed and the motivations clear. No wonder, they worked the characters out in the series before and they could build on that. In the new films they haven't formed that family yet, hell they had just one film, but the director is expecting from the viewer to believe they have already formed a bond. Why in gods sake? This doesn't work especially when Kirk saves Spock at the beginning. ""You know why I had to save you""......No...why? Looking at the first film, I think he could have saved the enterprise or the planet people better over just one crew member. Then, when Kirk saves the Enterprise and Spock is getting very emotional about it, I asked myself, why. I haven't seen a buddy play before and didn't get the impression that the two characters are friends and hang around share private thoughts or any other stuff that the old crew did. Technically they just have met and did go through the first film, hitting on each other. The ""saving scene"" was therefore totally out of context for me and spoiled the whole experience into the illogical and disbelieve. Yes I would go as far as saying that this scene was crap. They could have solved this very easily, by not showing that scene and letting the enterprise crash on earth, but not letting everybody die because of some dampers that spring on in the last moment. When they are saved they are told that the ship Khan was at helm, somehow vanished, making this a possible but not immediate future story. Looking at it now it lacks a lot of character development and the film consists mostly of effects and big bangs, lots and lots and lots of running around and big again, big explosions, hitting people and yes, big bangs. Hopefully they fix this in future films. If not, New Star Trek stopped at the first new film for me.",Star Trek Into Darkness
725,kevin_a_hall@btinternet.com,Boldly Going... Nowhere!,3,10 May 2013,"The Star Trek universe, resplendent in Gene Roddenberry's vision of a future wherein mankind has finally ""got its act together,"" while its social and economic problems are generally a thing of the past. Not in JJ Abrams' universe however, in which a corrupt Starfleet Admiral and a freshly revived genetically engineered 'John Harrison', an alias for a more familiar Star Trek adversary, take it upon themselves to create havoc with savage acts of treason and terrorism respectively.With seeming discount made to Roddenberry's unique take of Star Trek, evolving around the prevalent Hollywood ethos of filling seats at the local multiplex, Abrams' crafts, what I would term, a popcorn movie with plot-holes aplenty. With its target audience seated in place however, doubtlessly willing to overlook the obvious whilst simultaneously blinded by the startling visuals and 'tacked-on' 3-D (the film wasn't originally shot in 3-D, instead the process being added in post-production) this 'casual' viewer can safely check their brain at the door and, in all likelihood, enjoy...In this befuddled story, with its foot stuck firmly in Trek's The Wrath of Khan (1982), Into Darkness hauls its audience onto a seeming roller-coaster ride, dragging the viewer from one outrageous action set-piece to another, while its central characters are barely given a chance to 'grow' into their respective roles.In a likely nod to Trek VI – The Undiscovered Country, Sulu is afforded a brief turn in the captain's chair (a role which at least offered the actor some nifty poker-faced dialogue), whilst Chekov is contrastingly tucked away within the pipework-strewn bowels of the Enterprise' engine room. Scotty, meanwhile, refusing to sign for a delivery of conspicuously 'shielded' torpedoes, resigns himself into the background with his unusual but interesting little alien friend. This is clearly Kirk's film however, while his relationship with Spock (and by extension Spock's relationship with Uhura) being about the only things explored here. Worst of all however is Karl Urban's Doctor 'Bones' McCoy, who is virtually confined to pitching nostalgic-tinged quips: ""My God man, I'm a doctor not a nuclear torpedo technician,"" a character so painfully underused here – particularly given the actor's obvious talent in this role.Evolving around two villains, each of whom possessing completely different agendas, 'John Harrison' (Benedict Cumberbatch) and a warmongering Starfleet Admiral (Peter Weller), the latter of whom taking command of a freshly constructed battleship class vessel named USS VENGEANCE. Despite a promising start however, having chased Harrison to his conspicuous Klingon hideout, Kirk is somehow 'manipulated' into seeking the terrorist's help; an inconceivable decision given the character's explosive introduction - which also ignores the obvious danger he poses. And let's not forget the supposed personal anguish felt by Kirk, of which Harrison had been its mastermind. Oh well, things disintegrate further when its finally realised just how incredibly stupid Kirk has been, trusting a known terrorist whilst the viewer, during the film's final reel, is woefully pulled along during their frantic re-attempts at his capture.With an ending pulled directly out of The Wrath of Khan, albeit with Kirk and Spock on opposite sides of the radiation screen doors, I was beginning feel as though I had been robbed of my admission: the contrived nature of this protracted scene, deriving itself virtually word-for-word from its thirty-year-old original, played out while the audience undoubtedly watched in astonished déjà vu. I use the term 'contrived' given that, not unlike the life-restoring 'Genesis Planet' seen in Trek's The Search for Spock (1984), the answer to Kirk's mortal dilemma was really only a hypo-spray away...As a Trek fan, I was bitterly disappointed here: the filmmakers might well have just re-shot Nicholas Meyer's film entirely. Sincerely what an utterly shameful and wasted opportunity all this hokum was.When I emerged from the cinema, I was somewhat stunned; processing what I had just witnessed on-screen. And after having slept on it, I was finally able to articulate the next day. What I had seen wasn't so much Star Trek – a series I so dearly love and consider myself a lifelong fan of – but some cheap (albeit very expensive, costing well over £120 Million) and certainly pale imitation of a film series that deserved far better scripting and storyline than this. These wonderful characters – legendary even – each of whom a household name, whilst some having inspired many a fan to seek similar professions in the real world, reduced here to mere caricatures' of their namesakes.Over-shadowed by the film's ample and certainly showy special effects, these characters seemed stunted and confined instead of simply being allowed to develop properly.Such a shame. 3 out of 10",Star Trek Into Darkness

I don't want to burden you with at least 12 major technical errors, forget that; not all of us are geeks, but storyline is something different. I feel sorry for die hard fans and all that bright, honorable, and full of hope Star trek brought to us in the past. This movie is action thriller and nothing more.

727,ph-68,Made me feel fifteen again,8,1 July 2013,"As a Star Trek movie, this works as well as when I was fifteen and tried to pick up girls by telling them I thought they looked great. I'm not saying the movie is embarrassingly obvious in trying to flirt with you, but as I watch it, with my brain even semi-alert, scene after scene of ""does the director really think I'm that stupid"" washes over me.Luckily I snuck a couple of beers into the theater with me so things got better. The action is great, the leads look cool, the fleeting flash of bare flesh feels fittingly flush with the superficial feel of the flick. Things explode. People run around, and sometimes die. It works, as a hipster version of Michael Bay.There's something satisfying in being forced to regress to fifteen again, which is why I give this film 8 out of ten. I sincerely enjoyed it, despite the endless parade of ""what the hecks"" the adult part of my brain was making.Why do they show levitating machines in the hospital, and then a forklift truck in the bunker? How does someone sneak high explosives into the top security facility... did we ban the TSA in the future? When did London move to the San Francisco bay. Scotty invents a portable device that can beam Khan halfway across the galaxy to the surface of a planet but they can't beam Spock out of a volcano because they have no line of sight? Seriously? And I thought Khan was... browner.They land in the Dead Zone but the buildings still have lights on. How exactly did so many Klingon ships find them so fast? The Klingon warriors wear heavy armor but don't carry any kind of guns, only swords. Then more Klingons arrive, and they all have guns. Random aliens appear randomly, playing no role except to make me feel this is a Star Trek movie. Uhura's earpiece appears randomly, just like the aliens. Also, how does it stay in her ear, and why is it ten times the size of a prehistoric Bluetooth headset? Seriously, it's HUGE!The future has no robots? Not even one? First they establish that they can't beam anyone up. They then forget that conversation and again establish that they can't beam anyone up. What mysterious force keeps throwing the Enterprise in all directions whenever its power fails? Kirk dies and Spock cries. Cries? Is this how grown men act? Must keep that in mind for when I grow up. When they fly off into the sunset, zombie Kirk doesn't choose a destination. How does Chekov know where to take them? All the planets in the closing credits look about one yard across.Yeah, I was traumatized to remember this whole list of bugs in the movie. That makes it something special. A movie this flawed and yet this enjoyable can only mean I was way, way too drunk the whole time.",Star Trek Into Darkness
728,ewansp-2,A fantastic ride!,9,15 May 2013,"I'd like to start by saying that Star Trek Into Darkness, after Man of Steel, was probably my most anticipated film of 2013. I'm not a die-hard Trekkie but I have always enjoyed Star Trek and have always gone to see each new film in the cinema. Quite simply I really enjoyed Into Darkness, it was one hell of a ride and a fantastic follow-up to the previous film in 2009. Amazing action, as always jaw dropping realistic effects and a great story combined with a wonderful cast of actors made this one of the biggest movie events this year! I found myself anything but bored sitting through this one. It was exciting, thrilling and action packed. The references and hark backs to the previous film were very cleverly integrated into this film as well and they are always nice to see. All in all a great film which will be another to add to my collection. Really enjoyed it :)",Star Trek Into Darkness
729,krissaddy,IMAX 3D is how you gotta experience this film. Super cool!!,10,17 May 2013,"Since there are other reviews that have already said what I wanted to say about this film. I will keep this short and simple. I'll tell you why I feel this is one of the greatest sequels ever. Firstly, I love the first reboot, Star Trek {2009}. I have seen it 23 times. I own the Bluray and I am addicted to that film. I had huge expectations for this film and I am glad to say its on par with that film and it even exceeds the first one in many ways. Though the promos and trailers show it as a darker film, which it actually is but still it has its light moments which are pretty witty. This movie has everything going for it. Be it direction, background music, screenplay, special effects, sound effects and sound mixing. The movie shines in all the departments. Great pacing, superb dialogs and incredible acting make this film a must watch. STID goes at warp speed and I may watch it a couple of times more. Its definitely the second best IMAX 3D movie I have ever seen after AVATAR. Simply Outstanding. 10/10 Gem of a movie. JJ Abrams had outdid himself. HE did the unthinkable. He has improvised on perfection.",Star Trek Into Darkness
730,micskogabor,Star Trek: Into Darkness: Live Long and Resurrect,5,13 June 2013,"It was a couple of years back when director J.J Abrams assumed the burden of creating an entirely renewed and fresh Star Trek. The result was a reboot: Star Trek (2009) was set in an alternate reality, and essentially featured the same characters from 'Gene Roddenberry's original series performed by a newly established cast. After three years, we finally get to see more adventures from the crew of the Enterprise, but the question arises: has Abrams managed to live up to the expectations generated by the first installment, or has he led his legacy into darkness?We quickly reconnect with the characters doing a 'suicide mission' on a vivid planet, inhabited by aliens, with only a couple of minutes to neutralize an active volcano. After a hell of an intro, we jump to Earth just to learn that Kirk had been demoted, and his former mentor, Admiral Pike, assumed control of the Enterprise. It's doesn't take much until he regains his rank, as a rogue Starfleet commander, John Harrison, executes a bombing in Section 31, a defense organization in London. Now it's up to Kirk and his fellow crew to face and stop the menace.The confrontation of the evil happens many times: in space, on a Klingon planet, at the Starfleet Command, on the streets of London. Thanks to this we can truly understand the sense of danger and peril caused by the villain. Although battles scenes mostly consist gunfights, spaceship battles and hand-to-hand combat, there are plenty of chase scenes well beyond the realms of plausibility. Many of these are accompanied by mind-blowing visuals and scenery. The vast, colorful planet from the intro looks absolutely amazing, but so does the wastelands of Kronos (Klingon planet), and the futuristic London. The soundtrack shouldn't go unnoticed, as it's a huge pillar of the movie's structure. The epic orchestral music always kicks in at the right time: mostly at huge clashes and chase parts. Old notes intertwined with new sounds eventuate something really goosebump-worthy and awe-inspiring. It sent a shiver down my spine when the Enterprise emerged from the sea for the first time.Into Darkness never ceased to amaze me, although on a bigger note it's no revolutionary either. As much as I wanted to like the story, I would rather list it as a weakness of the film. Planet exploration, philosophical questions, alien interactions are all sacrificed for the sake of the action and the explosions. It, in fact, reminded me a lot more of Mass Effect than Star Trek mostly because of that.To be fair, it's not always action. Although it's a pretty lighthearted movie, the plot deals with a lot of emotions such as developing relationships, or caring for lost ones. Thankfully the chemistry between the characters (primarily Spock and Kirk) works, and is pulled off by many talented actors. What really stood out for me was the exceptional performance of Benedict Cumberbatch for portraying such an iconic character. Admittedly the crew of Enterprise did a great job in their respective roles, Kirk reminded me a lot more of Capt. Archer than (previous, William Shatner) Kirk, which doesn't necessarily counts as a shortcoming.All things considered though, Star Trek: Into Darkness is everything that a summer blockbuster should be, or possibly more than that. With JJ Abrams on the deck, I truly believe that the new Star Wars is going to deliver.",Star Trek Into Darkness

I mean the movie is quite good except for the main character who now is less of a brilliant captain he used to be, but more of an annoying overgrown backstreet boy on steroids. He simply is too heroic here.I fear that in next chapters he will be more agile and powerful than Legolas and Superman combined.Except for main character the whole movie is fun to watch with nice environments, beautiful ships, stunning lasers and cosmic stuff a typical Star Trek fan would expect.",Star Trek Into Darkness

This movie though is completely retarded. I am not going to list all the problems it has because that would easily go over the word limit here on the IMDb. Okay I will list one big problem. If there is a working transporter on the Enterprise, Why do they have to hide the ship underwater and have the crew swim down to get it? Answer: to have a cool looking special effects shot of the Enterprise flying out of an ocean ( complete with that fake lens flare that JJ Abrams loves) Basically, you go see this movie if you are only concerned about cool looking effects. There is very little character development, story, or logic. Probably cool while on shrooms, but that's about it.",Star Trek Into Darkness
733,Norm_uk,"Derivative, formulaic and clichéd",2,20 September 2013,"Where do I begin? I really wish I could say I am simply an embittered fan of the old trek but it goes so much deeper than that. This movie does nothing interesting or original. Cumberbatch out acted everyone around him even with such a dire script. It's amazing how Hollywood turned a franchise driven by fans into a formulaic and by the numbers money spinner. I was predicting what was going to happen within ten minutes of getting into it. On the plus side it looks pretty - then again it should given the amount of money poured into it. I can only hope Trek goes back to television when it can take more risks, focus on plots and not have to impress an audience it assumes is stupid and cannot watch for more than ten minutes without seeing an explosion.Abrams is definitely the man for Star Wars...and definitely not the man for Star Trek.",Star Trek Into Darkness

But the fact of the matter is, this movie really isn't for us.When Star Trek: The Next Generation came out, it was widely hated by fans of the original show for not being the original show. I grew up watching it, it was my Star Trek, just as the Original Series was my Father's. And the fan's weren't wrong, they're very different. But to me The Original Series is dated and cheesy, and TNG is the ""True Star Trek"".Now that torch is passing onto the newer movies, and a new generation of fans. Maybe giving it the Marvel movie treatment (Quippy dialogue, comedy moments and gratuitous CG action and effects) is the way to go. If this movie gets a new generation of people into the franchise, I can't say it's bad.There's a tendency for people to view new things as being inferior to what they're used to. Just listen to your weird Uncle that tells you that Led Zepplin is the greatest band that ever was, and all modern music is garbage, to see how true that is. But if we set aside our prejudices, it might be possible to see that the popularity of the new movies is just the next evolution of the universe.Those that can appreciate the deeper, more philosophical bent of the older iterations will most likely seek them out, and those who don't will see the movies and leave it at that. And that's okay. The Star Trek we loved isn't somehow getting erased, it'll always be there. And when the time cones for this new generation to give way to another hopefully it will be just as successful, so that the torch can be passed on once again.",Star Trek Into Darkness

They're great fun, and they really explore the characters and their interactions.I saw the new Star Trek last night and whereas it might have not had the same level of character development, I really enjoyed it. Without giving away too much, I like the shout outs to the old movies through the dialogue and the characters introduced. The one thing people seem to be hammering this movie for, is the rehashing of existing characters or story lines. I, unlike these so called ""purists"" choose to look at this not as ripping off of old ideas, but instead as this:With the 2009 Star Trek, we were introduced to a new time line, in an alternate reality. This now gives the writers and producers the opportunity to do basically whatever they want. By reintroducing some of the same characters and trials, they show that even in alternate realities, some things are still inevitable. I didn't look at this movie and think, oh they're just ripping off ideas from the originals... I thought, wow so this was meant to be.If you can go into this movie with an open mind, you will probably love it. If you think Star Trek peaked in the 1980s...

I have to say though. After now seeing these 1st two new star treks. I don't like what JJ Abrams has done with it. He has the flash and fights etc etc. But there was much more contemplative type sci-fi and real science that appealed and appeals so much to people that are considered nerds by the overall world. It was like we finally had a cool world all our own.I feel absolutely none of that in these new films. These are 100% bing/bang/boom with no feeling at all that this was our special nerd nirvana.

But,sadly for me,it didn't. If Bruce Willis had got a lead role,this could easily be Die Hard 34. There's more action then SF to be found in here. A Star Trek movie is not supposed to be a pack of fight scenes every 10 min.,followed by a few wannabe smart-humorous lines between the supporting characters,and as a cherry on top,a half naked blonde showing her goods to Kirk,just for the hell of it. Captain of the Enterprise is not a trigger happy cowboy,breaking the Prime directive as he pleases,because he started some stupid rescue mission,where his 1. officer is lowered into a volcano(couldn't't that device be beamed in?),while he and his medical officer(what is he doing there?) steal some scriptures(for what?) only to do some(again unnecessarily)scuba diving. Throughout the whole movie,story only lays out the excuses for another action scene,logic and common sense are not obligatory. This movie will,of course,be a smash-hit,because it's made to be visually appealing,to please wide masses,mostly young,perhaps create new armies of Trekkie's,ones that don't really need more from a Star trek movie then a good space blast once in a while,Spock and Uhura getting married,a bit of kung-fu,and some T&A. I grew up on Star Trek,so this movie is obviously not made for me,but for some new generation of Star trek fans.P.S. I really doubt the phrases''Dear God'',and ''for the love of God'',will still be in use by the 2300-s. Star Trek has always been deprived of religion,so this really makes me sick.

739,MatthewTodd1,Star Trek Into Darkness: Movie Review,8,19 May 2013,"Inundated with aesthetically breath-taking visuals, bolstered with a clever narrative though bordering on the convoluted, ameliorated by an inspired take on an iconic Starfleet adversary, and seasoned with a measure of treachery, deceit and duplicity, Star Trek Into Darkness is blockbuster entertainment on the grandest scale. Undaunted by the runaway success of its predecessor, it boldly sores into the stratosphere as a revitalized intergalactic colossus transcending the modern day science fiction genre. On its Vulcan side, Star Trek Into Darkness is an intelligently scripted, sophisticated and shrewd specimen. On its human side it is frequently tempestuous, regularly humorous and every so often affectionate, it spectacles the conflict of human emotions in the most turbulent of times. Furthermore, beset with nostalgia soaked token nods and references to Star Trek's of old, teeming with witty dialogue, and awash with exhilarating action, J.J. Abrams' second enterprising effort in the celebrated series has plenty to satisfy obstinate Trekkies and casual moviegoers alike. Star Trek Into Darkness is a science fiction action-adventure movie co-produced and directed by J.J. Abrams. It is the twelfth feature-length film entry in the Star Trek franchise and the sequel to Abrams' 2009 Star Trek reboot, based on the Star Trek science fiction entertainment franchise created and established by Gene Roddenberry in the mid-1960s. It commences with the U.S.S. Enterprise and its plucky crew whose exploratory voyage has steered them in the direction of a primitive civilization on the fictional-Class M planet Nibiru. When Starfleet's General Order number 1, the Prime Directive is infringed the impetuous yet cunning Captain James T. Kirk is summoned back to Earth where he is reduced in rank from captain to first officer under Admiral Christopher Pike's command who reoccupies control of the Enterprise. Simultaneously, an unrelenting and inexorable former Starfleet Commander, Jon Harrison has instigated and launched an attack on a top-secret Starfleet installation on Earth. When Starfleet's high-ranking officers' lives are put in jeopardy at the hands of Harrison, Kirk with personal retribution on his agenda re-assumes captaincy of the Enterprise, and he and his crew embark on a mission of vengeance behind enemy lines to seize a supposed former comrade who's appetite for devastation knows no bounds. As the Enterprise and its crew are catapulted into darkness at warp speed, it soon becomes apparent that everything is not as it seems; a far-reaching web of deceit and duplicity is untangled leading to an epic showdown where allegiances will be brought into question and sacrifices will have to be made.Reprising his role from Abrams' 2009 Star Trek is Chris Pine, who uniform to his previous outing provides a stellar performance as James T. Kirk, the courageous, self-assured captain of the U.S.S. Enterprise renowned for his many female exploits and his end justifies the means view on Starfleet orders. His portrayal of the fabled Captain Kirk is akin to that of William Shatner in his finest hour. Also reprising his role from Star Trek Into Darkness' predecessor is Zachary Quinto as Kirk's notorious cohort aboard the Enterprise, the unyielding, super-intelligent half-Vulcan half-human Spock. Quintos' portrayal of Spock is exemplary, markedly and strikingly similar to that of Leonard Nimoy, the original Mister Spock otherwise known as Spock Prime. His ""unintentionally"" condescending normative judgement afforded for any of Kirk's dubious commands and his golden lecture like recitals of Starfleet directive are first-class. In consort with his razor-sharp retorts packed full of wit and his exemplification of emotional discovery, Quinto provides the movies stand-out performance amongst other remarkable character interpretations including that provided by Benedict Cumberbatch who plays the films main antagonist, the malevolent and genetically advanced former Starfleet Commander Jon Harrison. Cumberbatch is suitably menacing and articulates Harrison's dialogue in an especially chilling manner. In addition to this, his animated facial expressions and piercing stares mould an ominous character that translates on-screen to a believable and genuine threat to Starfleet and to the Enterprise. Karl Urban returning as Leonard ""Bones"" McCoy with his cranky nostalgic wisecracks and gags is great, and Zoe Saldana reprising her character of Uhura is particularly good in her intimate scenes with Quinto/Spock, which divulge the plights in their strained relationship. From calamitous ruin to a triumphant rebirth, Abrams' second Trek sees the U.S.S. Enterprise experience a multitude of extremities, with the Enterprise and its exuberant crew looking as elegant as ever upon its full revival. Both of Abrams' entries in the formidable franchise are highly commendable and praiseworthy, but his latter effort with more nail-biting uncertainty and a splendidly unnerving villain slightly edges it. Star Trek Into Darkness and its precursor may be treading old ground, but it is doing it boldly. I have no reservation in saying that in the hands of J.J. Abrams, the Star Trek franchise will continue to live long and prosper. Dammit, Jim! I'm a doctor, not a fortune-teller.

740,joemhoward,It's a fun film not a philosophy lecture!!,8,31 May 2013,"This is simply a fun movie with great action sequences, a decent script and good characters. Yes, if you look too hard you'll find flaws but this is fairly irrelevant if you are not learned in the Trek Universe. That being said I am a fan of the films and this the best by miles. , and so much better than any oh the Next Generation movies. Why would anyone grumble over the Enterprise underwater? This is entertainment but its not Michael Bay thankfully. It makes sense! Do yourself a favor and join the ride and another thing, the 3D for once is stunning! Honestly, some people seem to think Star Trek should be some Dalai Llama- esque meditation on life. Quite frankly, it has more going for it than most. Even with Damon Lindenof on board!",Star Trek Into Darkness
741,jmcnulty-1,Did I watch a different movie?,3,17 May 2013,"I'm looking at the reviews here and there are pages and pages showing 9's and 10's. Did I watch a different movie? The biggest plot hole starts with James T. Kirk! Why would anyone trust a Starship to a petulant, spoiled, childish, immature, brat of a man who turns to alcohol at the first bump in the road and who constantly endangers the life of his crew and the entire ship? We are supposed to believe that the Admiral sees some redeeming qualities in this roguish pompous dolt...but we never quite know what it is. Kirk is portrayed as a gambler and a chancer, who makes more mistakes than the lowest midshipman, which is about the level of his ability, not really someone you'd want to save the World exactly! The supporting cast are more comic relief than believable characters.I like my sci-fi to have some sense of real possibility at least and not total fantasy. For that I'd watch Harry Potter.",Star Trek Into Darkness
742,krool1969,JJ Abrams does it again!,3,17 June 2014,"Yet again JJ Abrams sullies the name ""Star Trek"". Gene Roddenberry had a certain view of the future and a vision for Star Trek that he fought like hell to keep in the movies and TV shows. After he died his wife carried that touch as best she could but after she passed there was no one left to fight the fight. People like Abrams could take Star Trek anywhere they wanted. This time he is not even original, stealing story lines from other Star Trek stories. It's like watching season 1 and 2 of TNG!Into Darkness is defiantly full of action, if that's what you like you might still enjoy this film. But the action and excitement of this film falls just short of making up for the unlikable characters, implausible events (like hiding Enterprise under the sea. Would it not be FAR better to hide it in orbit?) and unoriginal story line.I would not have so many problems with this film if it wasn't trying to be Star Trek. It is a fairly good action flick (which is why I gave it a 3 instead of a 1) but in taking the Star Trek title, it should at least try to keep within Gene Roddenberry's vision. We owe the man that much at least. Instead Abrams is only out to make as much money as possible using Star Trek. Ironic considering Roddenberry's vision of a non-monetary economy.",Star Trek Into Darkness
743,sircles,A pizza with every topping in the shop...,1,9 May 2013,I saw this film at a private screening and it is basically a remake of Star Trek 2: Wrath of Khan.Benedict Cumberbatch plays the role of Khan very well but everyone else is pretty lame.So much goes on and so may films are borrowed from that halfway through you feel that you've been in the cinema for 10 hours.The crew are quite irritating and every time they evaded disaster or death I was a little disappointed.If you are new to Start Trek it might not be so bad but as an admirer of Wrath of Khan it felt like a bit of a wimp out by the writers.,Star Trek Into Darkness
744,saureign-364-997281,A Star Trek movie without Star Trek,6,18 May 2013,"I thought it could have been not possible to see a movie with the name Star Trek on it, which does not have any substance in it. Yes, the action is non stop, the CGI is breath-taking, but where is the soul of a trekkie? Star Trek is about the human mind trying to expand its condition, and all the challenges attached to it. This movie has a weak plot, it's not about alien danger (see the Klingon's blue eyes and their punk appearance), and doesn't involve any non-humans (only in the back landscape) - both new Trek movies have peculiar and rather human negative heroes, the imagination remain utterly limited. So much for the 'space, the final frontier'... These movies have Star Trek on them by mistake.",Star Trek Into Darkness
745,ianregbull,Not in Accord with Star Trek,2,22 May 2013,"The start was really good. I thought if the whole movie can keep up to this level than I will be highly pleased. But it hit a wall after the first scene and became another CGI film with so little to offer. The first scene - WOW! And there was a lovely piece of music as backing in one of the first dramatic scenes that I thought was wonderful. But then the wall emerged and it descended to CGI only. What has happened to movies - or to be precise - these type of movies?? I'll even state it again using exclamation marks. What has happened to these type of movies!! Do the movie-makers think that CGI is enough? I went and saw The Hobbit the other day and it is exactly the same but this time it is Tolkien that was desecrated rather than Star Trek. Don't the movie-makers know that it is the quality of the story-line and the characterization that has given these creative works their greatness? And oh God!! - how I am tired of the multitude of impossible escapes or staggering feats. It is all utterly unbelievable!! Doesn't it bother the producers that it is unbelievable? I just sit there going, bullshit bullshit bullshit. Don't they ask themselves, "" Is this believable?"" Apparently they don't care. To put it concisely - these action-type movies that rely solely on CGI affects and hardly anything else are just trash. They are nearly worthless. Like a blown egg. The shell is left but there is nothing inside. Just eye candy. I'll leave that criticism and take up another one. This movie doesn't adhere to the real message of Star Trek. It is not in sync with all the rest of the Star Trek franchise. And it is suppose to be. There is just so many discrepancies. One of the messages of Star Trek is that in the future, cool heads have prevailed. Mankind has largely moved beyond a money driven economy and warlike division. They have risen passed their shortcomings and ignorance. There has been a significant enlightenment. This is what makes the Star Trek franchise so positive and interesting. I will explain to you a large discrepancy. On all star-ships that I have watched or read, the bridge is quiet, efficient and stately. It reflects the cool command of the captain and bridge crew. There is a side room where the senior officers convene to discuss the mission at hand. There they quietly discuss diplomacy, technicalities, analysis... To speak descriptively, the bridge has a solid feel to it, contrasting to the fact that the ship is hurling through space. Subjectively, it expresses dependability ,efficiency, confidence and humanness (even homeliness). Now lets view the inside of the Enterprise in these last two Star Trek movies. The bridge is totally white!! Even the corridors are white! The computer screens are transparent. And the whole bridge and ship and crew are in a state of chaos. Now, subjectively, the two star ships couldn't be more different. Now this seems to illustrate the problem with this Star Trek movie in a nut-shell. Consummate quiet efficiency, confidence, dependability, rationalism - these qualities are not exciting enough for the people making this movie. They have to amp it up at all cost, to make it more sensational!! Make the whole movie a roller-coaster ride, have the characters argue all the time, let no cool heads prevail. Put them up against impossible odds multiplied by 10. Roller-coaster, roller-coaster, roller-coaster. We understand!! You want to put bums on seats!! Get the teenagers involved. But enough is enough. And god damn, leave Star Trek (and also Tolkien) alone! If all you can make is a glitzy Hollywood movie then leave Star Trek alone. These movie makers don't give the public enough credit. They treat us like morons. Do they think this is enough? But it is all dollars. In the end they'll probably make a squillion. Anyway - I have spewed out enough bile. And to think, I started this review so calmly...",Star Trek Into Darkness
746,stephenbell2006,Fast Octane Fun,7,6 June 2013,"Being a little detached and almost ignorant of the cult classic TV Show, I left cinema with the joyful sensation of having enjoyed a octane fun-packed film.With no past experience of the franchisee to count on, JJ Abrams directs a beautifully shot film with special effects that leaves one optimistic about his chances of making the upcoming Star Wars reboot a success. Although borderline at times, I believe the comedy humour worked well with Simon Pegg and Anton Yelchin proving many a raised smile.Plot wise the movie simply doesn't hold up, but you are rarely given a chance to digest this fact, by the fast-paced nature of the plot. The other possible negative aspect of film for me was Cumberbatch's performance, after many a Sherlock episode I was left a little underwhelmed by this soulless, rigid, statue like performance.Kudos to Mr JJ Abrams for rebooting a cult classic to new and old followers.",Star Trek Into Darkness
747,alison-465-684768,Watch it and ignore the critics!,10,9 May 2013,"We watched ' Star Trek - Into the Darkness this afternoon (May 9th 2013).I am not going to reveal specific details because this film is so new that I am aware that many people still have not had the opportunity to watch it, and I do not wish to ruin their experience.Having read the points raised in the 'maddog' review I just wanted to say that we found it to be a truly absorbing and brilliant film, and our views are so diametrically opposed to 'maddog' that I genuinely wonder if he/or she actually watched the same film - or slept through it and took a wild guess as to its quality.Star Trek - Into the Darkness is mainly a fast paced action film interspersed with scenes of human interest which facilitates the deeper development of the main characters and their inter-relationships. The phrase 'bonding under fire seems appropriate.I would urge people not to be dissuaded from watching this film because a reviewer cannot see the link between Gene Roddenberry's much vaunted ideals and therefore trashes J.J. Abrams work. Let me just say that as I am in my 66th year, I have watched ALL the Star Trek series and films and can advise that this film combines a serious reflection of William Shatner's portrayal of James T. Kirk but also matures Chris Pine as the film progresses. As Roddenberry was closely involved with original Star Trek series I therefore believe that he would approve the direction that Abrams is taking the latest incarnation of Star Trek.Star Trek - Into the Darkness is aptly named. It is rich in plot detail and exciting to watch. It will have many people sitting on the edge of their seats, willing those embroiled in battle to succeed. Even the villain (stunningly portrayed by Benedict Cumberpatch) warrants a certain amount of sympathy from all fair minded people.My advice - Go, Watch - and be thrilled by a brilliant film. We will go and see it again!!Our thanks to all those involved in bringing this to our screen - great job!",Star Trek Into Darkness
748,frank-kimmel-69,"Please Mr Abrams , NEVER return to the Star Trek franchise EVER !!!!",3,18 May 2013,"I Must say, I was font of the first one you made. It was a fresh start, bit heavy on the action and not enough science and Character development, but hey, it was fun.Well here comes the second installment, and guess what, lets make a moronic action movie and spray it with Star Trek lore......DONE. Lets Steal from Old sf-shows like Farscape (the submerged spaceship scene) and some other shows. Oh yes and before i forget lets borrow the fascistic Uniforms from Paul Verhoeven's ""Starships Troopers"" and make Starfleet look like the ""Third Reich"".The movie itself was a collage of action sequences nothing more. Kirk going out of control in order to try and reach his Goals at all costs. Please, in the next one send Picard to resolve this clusterf.... of a time line and continue were the last one with Picard ended.The 3 stars are for the Special Effects of this movie which are really great.This is what i felt after seeing the movie. :(",Star Trek Into Darkness
749,azlaniandevil,Family is everything,10,26 October 2015,"One of the best experience in the cinema for me I got chills done my spine when I heard the awesome theme and the title. In this review I'll talk about the main message. First lets get it out of the way, the film looks beautiful, it's well shot, prosecution design is good as usual for any Star Trek material, editing is spot on and it's wonderfully acted. Now what this movie is all about is based on one line khan says which is ""is there nothing you won't do for your family"" like a good director should this film focuses on Kirks ability to handle a ship like a captain and grow in the progress basically this movie is a character development for Kirk. In the first one it was a set up and it showed how much of a trouble maker he was doing all of those ""young"" things. From the beginning we see Pike as a father figure trying to tell Kirk not everything is gonna be easy and he must be ready when everything stacks up against him. Then we go with Kirk on his journey to become a better self aware captain. We finally see him caring about the risks of the mission when confronted by Admiral Hacket. This is where Kirk is most venerable and finally meet the risk face on and underhand what Pike was trying to tell him. And he proceeds to explain how his crew is his family and he wants no harm done to them due to his actions. This is great character development because this is where we truly see change and see him act like a captain and face the threats. Now the line Khan said now comes into play because khan is doing the same to do whatever necessary to keep his family/crew safe. This is why I love this movie because it makes You compare Kirk and Khan and see what they do to keep their families safe. This movie is a build up to see Kirk become worthy of sitting on the captains chair",Star Trek Into Darkness
750,sawfish666,if there was a Zero...,1,11 October 2013,"...I would have used it instead of the 1 star.I was never much a fan of Star Trek and am much less inclined to be one now.If you're feeling mean-spirited and looking for what seem to be unintended laughs, you'll find many. Perhaps the best example of what you'll find is the scene near the end, when the Enterprise is in desperate trouble for perhaps the 7th time since the beginning of the film, and Kirk has been battling Khan with uninhibited vigor since the beginning of the film. By his actions, alone, Khan has given Kirk no reason to believe that he can be trusted not to get into mischief with even a piece of stale cheese, but on top of that, there were several awkward and graceless narrative expository sequences that described Khan as being dangerous, amoral, remorseless, and entirely homicidal.At that moment, as the Enterprise is fragmenting around them, Kirk gives Khan as steady, manly look, and says:""I want you to know that I'm against everything you've ever done, and I will bring you to justice...""...long, soulful pause...""...but I have to ask for your help now.""",Star Trek Into Darkness
751,severus2310,A great movie which kept the main traditional Star Trek legacy and made necessary and great improvements,10,19 July 2013,"This is the second edition to the Star Trek franchise created by JJ Abrams. The first movie by JJ Abrams was very good and this was even better. There were the same familiar actors as before and this time new characters some from 'the wrath of Khan' and they were played perfectly and there was really good casting. The characters all changed and showed their own strong personalities and sense of identity throughout the movie and many emotional connections between the crew and other characters were shown. The story was not as complex as the first movie and it wasn't completely necessary to watch the first movie but it would help for understanding. The story was brilliant and had many twists and at many times it was uncertain what was going to happen and who was the villain, it was very clever but at some times may have been a little bit fast which wasn't a negative point but may not be preferred by some people whom prefer a slower movie and it does therefore need attention to understand. The background music was very important for the effects of several emotional scenes which both created a sense of awe and a sense of familiarity and emotion and so did the use of keeping the traditional and most favourite things of the original movies. The movie moved through smoothly and was non- stop action and suspense, but still had a few spaces with some character and humor to catch your breath. The animations and special effects of the movie was greatly used and was the most important tool in modernizing the old start trek effects.",Star Trek Into Darkness
752,rhrunge,Check your brain at the door...,6,21 May 2013,"This movie was mindlessly enjoyable, but riddled with plot contrivances and nonsensicals. The opening scene seemed liked a total ripoff of the Temple Run app. Literally, Kirk and Bones running out of a temple while being chased by natives. Khan saves the child of a grieving father. All he asks in return is that the father blow himself up along with all of downtown London? WHAT? WHY? So that he could break into an archive building? WHAAAT? WHY? Do they still have archive buildings in the 23rd century? Spock tattles on Kirk for disobeying the Prime Directive (which sets up a series of other events) but that's exactly what HE did when freefell into the belly of the volcano. WHAT? Almost every other scene in this movie makes no sense plotwise. On another note, Uhura, Bones, and Chekov are completely wasted in this movie. Chekov spends the entire movie running thru a maze of pipework in the engine room, Uhura is whiny and scorned and spends the whole movie talking about how Spock doesn't really love her. Bones is just there to say ""Dammit Jim, I'm a doctor...."". This is a video game of a popcorn movie. If you want to make any sense of the plot you'll be disappointed.",Star Trek Into Darkness

I will say that this one of those rare gems of a sequel that is just as good as the first. The lens flare is still there but still... Even for the non-Trekkie this movie is very enjoyable. Fantastic performances all around. Great direction from JJ Abrams. And Great cinematography, the beginning scene is one of the most beautifully shot scenes I've seen all year. I was a fan of the film but it is not necessarily a film I will be left thinking about much after I have left the theater or a film that I will highly recommend.

Despite this being a whole new universe it is still based on The Wrath Of Khan almost entirely, and for those who are die hard Star Trek fans Leonard Nimoy is in it again.And to answer the most important question ever asked, the answer is yes His name is Khan, so hell yeahReasons why you should watch it, it is amazing, it is amazing, it is amazing and finally it is amazing.So my advice... watch it, love it and you will realise it's true awesomeness",Star Trek Into Darkness

It's visuals and action sequences are amazing, but don't overshadow the plot and the character development. It is just as good as the first one in my opinion, but has a much better villain. We also get to see the side crew get more to do, and see Kirk and Spock's friendship grow. Benedict Cumberbatch steals the show! His character was deep, and his motivations for causing evil was clear. The film is pure excitement from start to finish, and the stakes have never been higher. The fights and the epic space battles were just as good as ever! This is probably my favorite film of the year so far because it's not just a good movie for Star Trek fans, but just movie fans in general. Much like the first one.

757,gungadin_stocks,"Old rehash of a story, why no fresh material?",7,6 June 2013,"First the third installation is going to be bad for the true fans, mark my word.I am a big Star Trek fan, I have watched the original series countless times and know some lines by heart. I have watched every episode of next gen, voyager, enterprise and some of deep space. I did not like the first Star Trek movie, for the most part I liked the old cast movies enough. The Next Gen movies were pretty bad for the most part. We had so many bald villains in next gen and even in the first of the last series, they aren't exactly memorable characters.I enjoyed the first of this series enough. This one was pretty good, they didn't totally destroy any of the characters, like they did to IronMan 3. I can see myself watching this series again and I don't do that much. It was a simple plot, but I did like the interaction of the characters.The only negatives: I think they under utilized Doctor Mccoy, as he only had one liners throughout his parts. bOy and this new Mccoy gained some weight. They used Uhuru way too much IMO.They never use the replicator and I would have liked to see that kind of tech. I kinda like when you saw the old cast eating etc in the original series.My primary concern is they used an old villain again. Since the series can go anywhere since the past was altered not sure why they didn't do something fresh. At least they didn't give us yet another bald villain. These remakes are just lazy writers who have no imagination.I guess the cast is ready to do one more movie, The third movie in the series is usually when they kill the series for the fans. I see this in Star Treks future I am afraid. Since none of the actors will be back for a forth, the writers will basically kill off what is left of any loyalty they had for the fans.",Star Trek Into Darkness
758,Theodor-turner,"Spectacular in every way, another great addition to Abrams' collection and possibly the greatest film in terms of entertainment of all time.",9,12 May 2013,"When I first watched the 2009 Star Trek reboot, I thought that - despite it's flaws - nothing could compare entertainment-wise. That was until I watched its darker, grittier sequel, Into Darkness. The flaws from the first movie are gone, and there are a number of great additions to the series, which I wholly hope will continue.Into darkness is an action-packed, but well-paced movie for hardcore Trekkers and newcomers alike. The writing and screenplay are excellent: the storyline is thoroughly enjoyable throughout and draws from elements of some of the best Star Trek films from the past. Our heroes are back, but this time they're even better: Spock (Zachary Quinto) is Vulcan as ever, and Kirk (Chris Pine) is a humbler, more Shatner-esque captain. Actors in supporting roles all do fantastic work. No star's acting can be faulted. Most impressive of all, the villain (whose name I have withheld to avoid spoilers), played by Benedict Cumberbatch, is both compelling and fantastically developed. Over the course of the movie, I began to empathise with the seemingly misunderstood antagonist, but - with a sudden, well-placed plot twist, I started to hate him, more than any other movie villain before. I took pleasure in seeing the crew of the Enterprise finally deal some blows, and genuinely felt part of the movie. Into darkness made me cry, cheer and rage in the best of ways, like I never had before.As with any other Abrams movie, the special effects are incredibly impressive. The director has a way of making the large feel large and the epic feel epic, which really adds to a movie like Into Darkness. The direction was, in a word, spectacular. When I watched the film, it was in 3D IMAX, and I can honestly say that this was one of the few movies 3D added something to. It had me on the edge of my seat throughout, and during several different parts of the film, the entire audience jumped. I had never seen that before other than in a horror movie. I really was impressed and will be seeing it again as well as buying it on Blu-ray and adding it to my collection of favourites.The only criticism I cold possibly make is that the soundtrack - though one of my favourites - is a little overused. It does not detract from the experience at all, so I didn't feel that such a minor fault was worth me deducting a point out of 10.If you love the Enterprise or don't, Into Darkness is a fantastically entertaining experience throughout its two and a half hour runtime. It's definitely my favourite film of all time, and I believe it's going to make it into the IMDb top 10 movies ever made.",Star Trek Into Darkness
759,eoinmcandrew,"""The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few""",8,12 May 2013,"The words of Spock (in whichever era you prefer) stand more of a testament to J.J. Abrams approach to this sequel. Visually stunning and exciting the film never lets up. From the beginning we are thrown into the middle of a massive scene, besides a space of about ten minutes on Earth, we are thrown on to alien planets, space battles and chases. Most notably we are treated to some fantastic character moments and are able to witness the blossoming relationship between Kirk and Spock. Old references and nods to the original series should keep die hard fans happy , Bones and Scotty in particular. However, Benedict Cumberbatch really steals the show as ""John Harrison"". On hearing initial reviews of him I was very skeptical of him, but believe me he is as good as they say! The one real complaint is the story not necessarily burns out like the Enterprises engines( ho hooo!) but that it could do with a chance to catch your breath. Essentially this film is a great continuation of the first film, although I'l admit overall I do prefer the first one. 8 out of 10 and more of the same please!",Star Trek Into Darkness
760,bruce-spencer-ky,Character Review,4,30 May 2013,"I was 10 when the first Star Trek series came on TV. I've watch all of the originals, all of Next Generation, all of the movies, a large percentage of the other series, and read several of the books. Regrettably, this movie did not at all feel like Star Trek to me.I'll review the characters rather than the story: ***WARNING: SPOILERS*** Bones (Karl Urban): Urban's depiction of Bones was played perfectly. He provided the only banter usually seen among Kirk, Spock, and Bones.Scotty (Simon Pegg): I'm sure James Doohan would have approved and enjoyed the humor.Uhura (Zoe Saldana): Saldana's part wasn't up to her acting abilities.The Klingons: Why would anyone cover up a Klingon's face with a full helmet? The Enterprise (yes, she is a character): She's a Star Ship not a submarine! That was not Engineering I've ever seen on any star ship in the Star Trek universe – it was a stunt set for running.Khan (Benedict Cumberbatch): unfortunately a great actor can't go beyond the script. Two major character mistakes in the script: (1) Khan Noonien Singh is too much a living tribute to Machiavelli's The Prince to cry - it's just not in his character. (2) Not a single quote from classical literature to flaunt his ""superior"" intellect, not one. No Melville, no Shakespeare, no Miltonnothing. Where was Khan's venom, ""from Hell's heart, I stab at thee! For hate's sake, I spit my last breath at thee!"" Kirk (Chris Pine): Pine is a good actor, but he (and the writers) need to remember that the character Kirk always knows more than everyone else (you can see it in his eyes), always holds something back, and always lets the audience know that he's several steps ahead of everyone else.Spock (Zachary Quinto): A very good depiction of Spock, but I feel as if something is missing – something subtle about the internal struggle between his Human and Vulcan self. Spock is played too young (he's suppose to be about 40 years older than Kirk) in his attitude and his actions. I don't believe he could break down the barriers of decades of Vulcan training and express the emotions he has in the time-line of this movie – especially not any public displays of affection. And he hasn't had time to explore the concept of friendship with Kirk.The one place that Star Trek has out-shined all other science fiction (especially Star Wars) is in the sheer body of its stories and characters. That's why the die-hard fans refer to a ""Star Trek Universe."" That volume of work gives the characters depth.When Spock died in the original Wrath of Khan the impact was a tremendous and heart-wrenching because it felt true, because it's what Spock would have done, because Leonard Nimoy and William Shatner had created their friendship over time, because we knew the characters. And the words ""I have been and always shall be your friend"" were spoken to the audience as well as the character Kirk.Unfortunately the new franchise does not have that depth yet – two stories do not make a deep friendship and this Kirk and Spock cannot transfer that emotional connection from the original stories, so try as they might, the actors just couldn't make Kirk's death work nearly as well. The new franchise has not given its Kirk enough time to even be acquainted to Spock and his crew, so the sacrifice does not have the same impact.I hope the franchise last long enough, and turn away from ""Action"" enough, to give this new generation of fans that type of character depth.",Star Trek Into Darkness
761,oliverthered,It would have been better if it had have been worse,2,24 September 2013,"What is it with the last few modern films I've watched, there seems to be a trend in very expensive b-movies and if you're making a b-movie at least you want to get someone like George A. Romero to direct it.All of the budget of this film appears to have be spent on a disintegrated special effects combined with a mix of costumes from the wardrobe department equivalent of pound land, blue screen sets where the actors appear to have no clue what is going on around them or what they are doing.Full to the brim with over acting and the attempts to pump up the action using fast paced, meaningless dialog.Yes I remember the original star trek series and maybe the quasi b-movie style is an attempt to hark back at that but only resulted in a fail, like a mix between Barbarella and CSI.If you like all you're Aliens with heavy American accents and something aimed at kids with content I personally don't feel is suitable for kids (bad language and violence etc...) then maybe you'll like it more than I did.",Star Trek Into Darkness
762,benoitstandaert,A great movie,9,18 May 2013,"Just back from the movie and enjoyed the last Star Trek... Better to know your classics Star Trek Movies for this one if you want to appreciate it at its best, lots lots lots of references to previous movies and lots of explanation/question answered coming to these old movies. Yep, if you are a Fan of the franchise... be bold and go where no one has gone before... nah that does not apply here, just go watch it... It is probably one of the best of the franchise. Acting is good, Special effect are good, action and story line not predictable... well just a little bit. For the non Fan or new to this franchise still a very pleasant moment. 9/10 if you are a fan, 7/10 if you are not a Fan or new to Star Trek. That is my rating for this movie. Oh BTW, without spoiling anything the Klingon are different here... the look... but it's for the best.This is the kind of movie you got to watch relax and mind free if you are a fan, I did not make the mistake to watch in 3D, it would have distract me too much I guess as a fan and would have miss a lot of these details that has made me a fan from the franchise. I would probably go watch it a second time soon and now may be in 3D. Be aware thought it is a very fast pace movie with lots of action and if you are a Fan you'd better to watch in 2D first then 3D to blow your mind again and again. I won't spoil the movie but this movie from start to end captured my imagination and they bring these little new stuff (said stuff to not spoil) that make you ponder if they are not recreating the universe of star trek original from scratch... answering the Fan some old question left behind and in the meantime pinning you down your chair to enjoy a great movie and of course bringing more question... even the movie is not like a to be continue one like some franchise (Lord of the ring and the like) it create this feeling to want more. When the credit came I had pass 2 hours of pure bliss thinking it was too short. Oh well, to me it means I can wait the next one, bring it on guy, you did a great job.For the Fan Only: So where this movie fits with the original, does it betray the original saga? I'd say no, should say NO IT DOES NOT, in fact it adds on on a saga so incomplete and cement a weird but so enjoyable puzzle: the puzzle of a world called Star Trek. Lots of Fan will not like what I just said... just take it that way: what would you like to see: a remake that leave you tasteless or an innovative movie that push the franchise forward and therefor make it more than alive? I love my Star Trek so I choose innovation and the heck with sore purist Fan.",Star Trek Into Darkness
763,hoohaa79,Star Trek - Crash/Bang/Wallop.,5,23 May 2013,"First and maybe my only review but I really had to vent!!As a fan of the original series and the motion pictures that followed, I was still blown away by the first Star Trek remake. With that premise, adding a sequel with what you think you know will happen (rumored, no spoiler here) and the fact that Benedict Cumberbatch would play the protagonist, I expected a film that would take me to ST 7th heaven.Disappointed is not a word I expected to use for this movie but alas it's the only word I can use to express my feeling of emptiness on leaving the cinema. The story was decent enough but I felt cheated when they altered (in 1 extreme case, reversed) some of the original outcomes.My primary beef with this film is that it was tantamount to watching a film that induced sensory overload. The plot pace and actions scenes were so fast and *heavy metal concert loud* I had little time to gather my thoughts on what was happening, no time to care for any of the characters, it was a roller coaster with no climb or loop, just shooting straight out and didn't slow for any build up of anticipation.The only thing that gave this movie a little flare were two actors, Benedict Cumberbatch and Bruce Greenwood. BC is brilliant, since seeing him in 'Sherlock' it's a given that he will bring some panache to the table of any banquet.I also, for a very rare occasion, gave in and watched it in 3D, this I regret was yet another gimmick that I will not be falling for again until someone in Hollywood makes a Sci-Fi flick that actually uses this tech to the max and not for the same old tricks.",Star Trek Into Darkness
764,rozeminho,The most ambitious Star Trek film to date.,9,3 November 2013,"This second installment of Star Trek follows a now experienced James Tiberius Kirk as he captains his crew on the prestigious USS Enterprise. He has now taken to the chair but not Spock's lack of emotion when it comes to certain situations. As a result of compromising a mission to save Spock's life, Kirk is relieved of his captaincy and is demoted to first officer. This doesn't last long as there is an attack on Starfleet's archives in London by an enemy that no one is aware of but Fleet Admiral Alexander Marcus. Kirk is then sent with his crew to find the attacker with limited knowledge about who he really is.Star Trek Into Darkness is definitely the most ambitious Star Trek film as it has almost everything you want in a Sci-Fi film. I'm not familiar with the past Treks but from what I hear they didn't manage to explore some of the things the modern adaptations have for instance Earth during the 2200′s and Kronos. Thank god for the development of modern technology for we wouldn't be exposed to such awesome sites as these. Thus heaps of satisfied fan-boys.What I love about this film is that it's more than just a space adventure, it's nothing like Star Wars as people might think. From what I've read Star Trek has always been about developing stories that encompasses drama and character, not so much about the thrills of space shootouts. Star Trek Into Darkness definitely has the action and large scale thrills that previous installments lacked but it also has a strong plot and story line. It's more of a space crime thriller than a full on action which I found quite refreshing. The action actually had substance, it wasn't just silly and gratuitous, there was a believable reasoning to each action sequence.What really differentiates Star Trek from any other space film is its filming style and overall look. We get too indulge our eyes to a colorfully crisp film with heaps of lens flares, which I actually like a lot. It gives the franchise a new identity but also gives the impression that the future is bright. The film's opening is probably the best example of a beautifully filmed shot of vivid colors aided massively by a great set.I like how this film tried it's best to film as much as they could authentically, making it really hard to pick out what's real and what's CGI. Huge props to them because it improves the film massively. The design as a whole is awesome, I don't usually notice costumes that much but they're freaking NAICE in this film, I want nothing more than to have a Starfleet jacket now.Performances and cast don't need to be mentioned as they were as solid as the last film. Slowly giving their own twists to their previously acted characters. I like the chemistry that they have which makes you as a viewer really buy into the crew being another family for these characters. What does need to be mentioned is the villain played by Bennedict Cumberbatch who is just phenomenal. I think quite a few people may agree with me when I say he's gotta be the best villain of 2013. His character is more than just a ruthless super human, he actually show's genuine emotion which almost makes his actions justifiable emphasized when he asks Kirk ""is there anything you would not do for your family""; then the mind games ensue. On the first viewing these mind games are great fun making the film a whole lot more tense; who's telling the truth and who's your enemy? Overall, great popcorn flick with more substance than your used to in your average blockbuster film.",Star Trek Into Darkness

At nearly 40 years of age subjected to the awful original movies as a kid, I finally get why Trekkies love the Star Trek universe.There is a robust galaxy in the backdrop, facing military needs versus humanitarian space exploration pressures. The plot is all about humanity trying to resolve deciding its future values as a civilization, while the bad guy ties into the original story and movie Wrath Of Khan without a hint of the trademark Star Trek corniness.Even my wife, an actual woman, enjoyed it. I'd recommend disregarding the Trekkie purist reviews on here, who appear to hate everything including Life cereal. It is a damn cool and quite intelligent film.",Star Trek Into Darkness

The characters have good chemistry and it made me remember how it felt watching the banter between the crew in TOS. I agree that it would have been a better movie had it fit with the ST franchise but I am glad we have something Trek related. I gave it a 9 because I enjoyed the movie for what it was. I am looking forward to the next movie (which we be a long time coming unfortunately)! I will be seeing this one again tomorrow.By the way, Zach Quinto's Spock could be the original twin of Nimoys.

This film is my absolute favorite! It has all the elements of a timeless masterpiece- lovable and strong characters, interesting and unique story, action, adventure, humor, romance, darkness, light, and best of all a movie that makes me think. The greater humanity of this movie is amazing, really makes me think about my life and how I too can live more courageously like Captain Kirk does. His character is admirable, strong, and relatable. I admire and enjoy this movie. Captain Kirk is one of my heroes! And the friendships that form between the characters is so realistic and eye opening. Great film!

Too much of this movie was taken, and sometimes literally, from the ""other"" movie, which I won't mention to avoid spoilers. This wasn't cool at all, just the opposite. This movie really felt like an action movie that just happened to use characters and a story from the Star Trek universe , but very little was worthy of Star Trek.

770,CoolGreatDane,Kirk's long adventure to find love.,4,17 March 2015,"So, this one goes about an oily foreheaded guy who lives in the future and is looking for some love. How do we know he lives in the future? Because they serve spherical ice cubes on your drink, instead of cubic ones like in the present. You know, is those little details that let you know the director of a film has actually traveled in time. How do we know he is looking for love? Well, he's single but he keeps on falling in love with all kinds of people.At the beginning he is madly in love with an old man that reprimands him, so we can assume Kirk is trying some weird old-man S&M stuff, sadly we do not get to see any of this because this old dude gets killed really soon, Kirk cries realizing he has lost his chance at tasting sweet sweet wrinkly love. He is angry and jealous of the weird guy that practiced some voodoo magic on his dying love by touching him on the face. Kirk starts to wonder if this Volcano Spork is perhaps a guy he could date, but for the moment being they will be just friends and see where that leads them.In one scene two cats are in his bed but he decides all of a sudden he's not into feline love (he clearly remembers what happened with frog chick in the first film). He then sees a half-naked senorita but this does not tickle his love bone, so he decides to move on.He also has a lover's quarrel with a guy that speaks like a Braveheart extra, the problem is that this porridge wog is in a relationship with an oyster, they debate and Kirk tries to harass him in his workplace so the weegie decides to leave.Kirk then stalks an exotic looking man called Gengis who moved to the Galaxy's ghetto, Kronos. He chases him and then puts him in a glass jail. Gengis is very upset because he is in love with like 78 or 134 lads and lassies trapped in some phallic shaped missiles.Then ex-Robocop appears and all hell breaks loose because he believes Kirk and Gengis are fighting over his daughter, when in fact no one is paying attention to this half-baked horny-teenager-bait of a character.At the end Kirk dies of radioactive love while confessing his love to Volcano, who cries and desperately shouts ""Can't!!!"". I guess he was trying to say ""Can't let my love die"". That's the only way I can make sense of that scene.Kirk wakes up at the hospital, so he didn't really die. This film is more like a Sleeping Beauty in space, Volcano being the handsome prince. At the end they go on a 5 year holiday to space Jamaica to practice some voodoo techniques of their own.All the people seems to have a K in their name: Kirk, Spock, Pike, Chekov, Khan. So it's OK if you name your children Clock or Funk or Kerchoo to get the ball rolling on weird K-including names.",Star Trek Into Darkness

The characters go through the motions of their established characters without much care or integrity. The formulaic plot is not aided by the refreshing approach of the first film of this cinematic cycle of star trek. There are lots of well done action set pieces and performances but there is little cohesion or sincerity in the plot to stay invested for the full run time and nothing about the story will stick with you after the day that you see it, especially if you are familiar with the original source material.",Star Trek Into Darkness
772,charliedoble,Star Trek: Into Darkness Review,4,10 September 2016,"Star Trek: Into Darkness was not a particularly good movie in my humble opinion. I know that many people liked the movie, and it was fairly well received by critics, and I can't for the life of me understand why. I guess i'll start with what I liked about the film. JJ Abrams definitely knows how to make a movie, as is showcased here. He knows how to get you onto the edge of your seat and how to build tension. The cast is good and they play off of each other well. I think that's all that I liked about the movie, more or less. Now to get into the bad stuff. My absolute biggest problem with this movie is the writing. There are so many blatant references to Star Trek in this that it actually started to make me angry. Unlike in Star Trek Beyond (2016), which had references, but they were more like hidden easter eggs that only the fans would get. Unlike in THIS. Whenever I heard a reference in Into Darkness I would think ""Hey! I get that!"" and it would completely take me out of the film. My other problem is the film's villain, Khan. He's an extremely dull villain with stupid motivations that don't make a hell of a lot of sense. Overall, I thought this was a disappointing and dull movie that I won't be watching again any time soon.",Star Trek Into Darkness

I used to make fun of old Doctor Who episodes for the bare sets and the cheesy effects but when you fill a movie screen with all kinds of special effects the way the new Trek movies do, it does become an unwelcome distraction.

If you don't then you are just rationalizing that this dreck is better than nothing. Well if the latter then don't worry because it sure looks like you will be getting more of the same soon.I know that technically this is not a review but instead if more of a rant. There are lots of other ""reviews"" out there to read. I am just frustrated and now fearful that JA will make Star Wars even worse that Lucas finished up once he gets his hands on that property.

I think this rated almost as good as Wrath of Khan in storyline and action. It was emotional and did a good job of playing the audience with the possibilities of where the storyline could go. I really appreciate the lack of spoilers that were released prior to the films' release. I am so glad I did not know where things were going to go! Thank you to all those in the press that kept things quiet! The main cast is settling nicely into their characters and the nuances of each are coming out even more this time. I am so impressed with how the core cast has managed to give the essence of the original crew without trying to BE them. Chris Pine as Kirk has created a very believable younger Kirk in every way. Zachary as Spock is uncanny. I highly recommend this movie - so far the one to beat this year, IMHO.",Star Trek Into Darkness

Suddenly Christopher Pike was never horrifically disfigured in a freak training accident, and he never returns to Talos. If you are doing a film in a hallowed series, you have a responsibility to research that series, honor what has come before, and extend its tradition of excellence. This film utterly fails to do any of that.J.J. Abrams is not a director, he's an event planner--for five year old birthday parties.

It felt as if the writers were lazy, and just half rehashed elements of the original movie.The portrayal of Kahn was weak, and no where as sinister as the original Kahn. The original movie showed a truly evil Kahn, and this movie traded physicality, and fight scenes, for real acting. If you want to see a better version of this movie, go find the DVD of the 1984 version.

That being said? I LOVED this movie. I even capitalized it I loved it so much. The play between the characters, the more human version of Spock, the absolutely delightful ""Scotty"" (although his sidekick is one of those throwaway characters I dislike) as well as a much better crafted plot this time made for a completely enjoyable movie. The action is intense, the friendship deepened between the characters, the twists and turns are a bit predictable at times, but that is reminiscent of the franchise as a whole. I am already excited for the next movie. I tremendously respected and appreciated the ties in this movie to the elements that make Star Trek great - strong story line, deep connection to the characters and a philosophical element. In some of the older Star Trek episodes the moral/philosophical element can be oppressively heavy handed. No so in the new Trek movie. The ideas of friendship, family and humanity are woven through this movie with subtly and I will outright admit I more than teared up during the climactic scene in the engine room. EVEN though I had already figured out what was going to happen, I have already come to care about, respect and enjoy the new actors in their iconic roles.So yes, ten out of ten. And let the haters, hate. Those who can not embrace change can go sit and watch old Star Trek reruns and bemoan the 'good old days' and spout off all the reasons why 'Star Trek ain't what it used to be'!!!!

Wrath of Khan is my favorite from the series. I loved Star Trek(2009) and I respect Mr.J.J. Abrams works. Even a week ago I re-watched Star Trek before watching the new one.Now about this movie. STID is a good movie, no doubt. Story balances James, Spock and Khan very equally. Scotty plays a vital role and others characters like Uhura, Bones, Sulu, Chekov gets limited screen time. Adding Alice Eve as Dr.Carol was a good choice. Benedict Cumberbatch did a fantastic job as Khan, beside him Zachary did great job. While Chris Pine did lost some of his charm as James T. Kirk. He was great in first movie but he is kind of average in this one. I didn't cared about him much.For me this movie some how failed to create the impact I experienced on watching Star Trek at 2009. May be I should watch it again. I am 26, I enjoyed Iron Man 3 few weeks ago. I am was excited about this movie but it didn't worked like that.Last Words: Star Trek Into Darkness is good movie.

The action for the sake of action ending just absolutely bites. So bad I almost felt like walking out as the climax was playing up on the screen. Such lame and lazy story telling and dialog. I sat there at the end and shook my head where is everyone else while the good guys and bad guys fought it out. The lazy writing couldn't take into account that there is planet (earth) full of people below, spaceships and space stations all over the place (per the trek time frame) but its like these two ships are fighting it out isolated.

Thus I find myself as a great Sci-Fi fan confused. I love, though, how his movies start. However a movie with just a good start is a movie with a weak plot. As a summary J.J.

Plus, for anyone who complains that these films are too action heavy when the original series was more about exploration - there's a nice line just for you.I do like J.J. Abrams and I think he has done a great job directing the film considering it is a summer blockbuster entertainment film. It does what it is meant to do - it entertains.

785,ArdiH,Space opera turned to soap opera,5,16 May 2013,"Space opera has always had a somewhat positive meaning to me. Its an adventure in space, one that does not take itself too seriously, but is still rich with unexpected developments. When done well (Iain M Banks, earlier Star Trek, Star Wars), this can be a hugely enjoyable genre, where the best elements of the classic adventure story are set into the endless imaginative playground of Space for one fun ride. But JJ Abrams did not want to take the quality space opera look-and-feel of the known Star Trek. Instead, he wanted to stage it his own (oh so recognizable!) way. And without fail, he succeeds in making it completely dumbed down, extra lens flare. The movie has no style, zero flavor; everything is said out loud, no thinking or empathy required from the audience. Dialogue is dripping with emotions that have no depth, the drama is completely overplayed without any actual tension. The tricks of your common 3pm soap opera are taken and just poured into the plot - bad parenting, painful memories of the past, couples fighting, hands touching through the glass, good guy dies then wakes up and smiles.And just like that, the great story of Star Trek is not played in space opera minor, but in soap opera major instead.

I have to say that it strayed away from what I expected and pleasantly surprised me in most ways.There are however a few pitfalls, the first being the whole light bad guy twist. Oh you think this guy is the bad guy, think again it's this guy, no wait you were right he is actually worse than the other bad guy, bad guy. It's a technique overly used in cinema and literature these days in a vague attempt to give you a shock or even just make the story slightly more interesting but I think it's time to put it bed.The second part follows on from this original plot point. Khan is pretty much the most remembered baddie from Star Trek, he's hyper intelligent, strong and more than a match for any member of star fleet, especially Kirk and co. Why didn't they just run with this? Instead you have Robocop playing the minor/major baddie which ever way you look at it and Khan has a back seat ride from just after the beginning right up 'til towards the end. They had to change the story obviously because it's a different universe, but come on.New Spock did the Khan? Couldn't they have left this out? I cringed when it happened, perhaps they could have left it for another movie with Khan in as they are obviously going to re-use him at some point. Yawn.I liked the movie don't get me wrong. Would I pay to see it knowing what I do now? Probably, there isn't much else out at the moment. For the general audience I feel this is a safe movie, nothing majorly shocking happens, minor shocks, yes but nothing Earth shattering, I never felt like the Earth or any major characters were in danger like the first reboot when they blew up the Vulcan home world and annihilated a host of star ships in the first thirty minutes. Now that was a spectacle, hard to replicate yes, yet I feel that we deserved something more from this movie.A safe play with recognisable characters, I think they should have taken a risk like the first movie. Alternate universe, let's get messy!",Star Trek Into Darkness
787,zeekmati,Good but not great,6,22 May 2013,"I am Star Trek fan though I would hardly call myself a Trekkie(Trekker?). Regardless, I have a good understanding of the Trek universe, it's principle characters, narratives and locales. This entire film is a giant wink, gun and nod to the entire franchise of Star Trek. It's to the point where the writers have decided that they want the characters in the film to be self aware as actors in a decade long show and movie franchise. There are constant references to Star Trek movies and shows of years past which is a neat touch to those that want to see a film solely based on obscure references. Well, I am NOT one of those people. I want a movie with a plot that makes me care. Better yet, I would settle with one that makes sense. I would like to see villains that are motivated by their own struggles. Their drive should be based in obscurity. The audience should almost agree with their cause but ultimately see that the good guys have a better plan that doesn't involve the end justifying the means. Star Trek Into Darkness has none of that. Those who are evil are too evil. Those who are good are way too good. Star Trek has never been about good vs evil.On the other hand, the acting was great special effects were fantastic and the humor kept the film fresh. The pacing was also quite good though I was surprised it ended abruptly. Mind you, one can expect this in the second installment of what is obviously going to be a trilogy.6/10 for lame story, lame bad guys, constant easter eggs, good acting, great special effects, humor.",Star Trek Into Darkness
788,jonathanhovda,IMDb Reviewers... REALLY???,3,28 May 2013,"So, after watching this movie, I can say it is a rehash of the original wrath of khan. Sure, it appeared they were going to end the movie with kirk dying, then being brought back to life and the screenwriters decided that those of us who saw the original were going to be incensed so they decided to add on a 1/2 hour ""second"" ending...Hollywood had evolved to this now. We are to the point were there is very little original ideas anymore. What else is coming up this summer? The man of steel (how many other superman movies have been done), the lone ranger (yeah, I still have the 33RPM LPs from my childhood).The problem isn't with Hollywood, it is with US! Don't buy tickets for this nonsense! Better yet, don't rate this rubbish so high! Who is giving this a 9 or 10 overall?! Lets put this in perspective, as of 28 May 2013, this movie has a 8.3 overall rating. The Wizard of Oz has a 8.2. Now, the Wizard of Oz is one of AFIs top 10 movies OF ALL TIME. Lawrence of Arabia is a 8.4, so it is only .1 above this nonsense... CITIZEN KANE is only 8.5 according to IMDb, which is only .2 above this drivel.What is going on out there? There is no way someone can see Citizen Kane, and see this movie and honestly give them the SAME rating. Come on folks. Roger Ebert is rolling over in his grave.",Star Trek Into Darkness
789,eAbyss,Leave your brain at the door.,3,29 May 2013,"The movie was a rip off of The Wrath of Khan and has action just for actions sake and had very little story and character development and none of the philosophy that made Star Trek great.There are so many things wrong with this movie when compared to the original series and movies. Yes it's in a different timeline but many things should remain the same.-When the Enterprise traveled to the edge of the neutral zone in order to torpedo Kronos the planet could easily be seen from their position which would place it in the neutral zone.-When they took the trader ship down to the surface of Kronos you can see the moon, Praxis, partially destroyed. The movie begins in 2259 but Praxis is supposed to be destroyed 34 years later in 2293.-They really messed up the look of the Klingons. I can't really describe it, you'd have to see it to understand but they look horrible.-There are cars on Earth. 99% of humans in Star Trek don't even know what a car is. They use trains, shuttles, and transporters, but not cars.-How close is Kronos to Earth? It's supposed to be 4 days away at warp 4.5 but it seemingly takes less than an hour to get to and back from there in this movie.There's other things wrong that has nothing to do with Star Trek's history.-When Pike calls in Kirk and Spock to chew them out for breaking the prime directive he says that it's based on Spock's report. He mentions that the inhabitants of the planet they saved now worship the Enterprise. How did he know? It wouldn't have been in the report because it happened after they left the planet.-The engines of the Enterprise now leave some kind of vapor trail. This was never in any of the original series or the 2009 movie.-Why didn't the Klingons know that the Enterprise was on the edge of the neutral zone when it was within eyesight of Kronos, the Klingon home planet?-Why could the Enterprise contact New Vulcan which is several light years away but not Earth which it was orbiting?-Why didn't Starfleet know about this huge battle happening in orbit between two of it's own ships? If they did know they would have attempted contact and sent other ships to investigate.I know I'm missing some things in my list but it shows that this movie has more holes than a block of Swiss cheese.Also, no ""the needs of the many out weigh the needs of the few"" quote when Kirk's dying or even a ""second star to the right and straight on till morning"" quote at the end when they start their 5 year mission and were deciding on which direction to go. Myself and other people were disappointed when these were not said.I sincerely hope that they do not base a new series on this F'ed up reboot. It would be a huge disappointment if they do.All that being said, it did look good even though it was originally shot in 2D, not 3D. It's looks and a few (too few) good moments are the only reason I'm giving it a four out of ten.",Star Trek Into Darkness

In this one, Spock are just a sidekick and just don't measure up with the expectations that I had.The opening scene (comparing it to the one in the first movie) just don't make any sense and do not add anything to the rest of the movie, being irrelevant. The plot doesn't make any sense and looks dumb.Honestly.. After only a couple days, I barely remember anything but the scene that Khan toke out a ton of romulans. I miss the sword fight, the Spock ""Prime"", the enterprise phasers, a planet being destroyed, federations ships being blow up....Khan almost saved the movie.. but he becomes blend too at the end. The last action scene (Spock vs Khan) looks a LOT like a Star Wars Episode 2 scene.. almost a copy. Overall.. is a blend movie and actually pretty boring in some moments.",Star Trek Into Darkness

You have.When the movies first came out, the producers tried to tell us that the plots would be updates of past television shows. ""Veeger"" in the first movie was the reincarnation of a bot of another name that appeared with Shatner and Nimoy. The genetically superior dictator Khan, who first graced television in the series reappeared in the second movie. Just when we hoped we were done with the ""superior intellect,"" lo and behold who should arrive in ""Star Trek: Into Darkness?"" That's right, sport fans: let's all welcome Khan back to the screen. He's pretty much the same self-absorbed, boring type only NOW he's practically as invulnerable as Superman.Of course, viewers felt as though they had been fed a pre-chewed and pre-digested rather old piece of celluloid when all they wanted was a movie that could ""boldly go where no one has gone before."" Too bad, cinema fans. That rancid taste in your mouth and the disgusting feeling of deja-vu will only leave you sighing, ""Oh, no. Not again.""However, if you are one who is easily swayed by characters running across the screen being chased or chasing someone, along with the loud noises so prevalent in action movies,then you'll love it.",Star Trek Into Darkness

794,KikiFlorida,Zzzz...,3,29 May 2019,"I'm not sure why this movie got such good user ratings. It was the first of the franchise which actually bored me. The film was a mindless action movie and had none of the intelligence of any of the television series. It's hard to enjoy the it even as a simplistic action movie when you can't summon up any interest in the characters' fates. Try as I might, I truly couldn't care what happened to any of them. Maybe I cared a little bit about Khan, but that would only be because of Benedict Cumberbatch's fantastic acting skills. The character of Khan himself was flat, just like all of the rest of the characters.I'm super disappointed in this movie, especially since I like JJ Abrams and the work he did on SW:TFA. I think the weak point in Star Trek Into Darkness was the writing. It always shocks me how much money studios are willing to invest in production values, actors salaries, and special effects. Yet they treat the writing as an afterthought. Not sure if that's because they don't invest in top-notch writers or because they put such limitations on the writers that there's not much they can do to make the plot interesting.Don't waste your money or time to watch this.

WBF-WNS (written by folks with no souls) should really be a new movie rating or disclaimer or something. a note on expectations. i see a few positive reviews in here that amount to ""i lowered my expectations to the very bottom, and the movie totally delivered."" i see this phenomenon popping up all over the place in the recent decade, especially with reboots or adaptations. frankly i have a problem with this line of thinking. i think people who are handed large sums of money should be held fastly to the task of not wasting my time and energy. i expect to be moved when i sit through a movie, not thrown. i expect to grow in some way, rather than shrivel. and if you say i ask too much, then i ask you: what would you create with a million dollars?",Star Trek Into Darkness
796,mangorick,"Plot holes, terrible dialogue, and Star Trek in name only",2,20 June 2013,"I was the only person in the theater so I was able to take notes in my phone about what was excreted off the screen in real-time.What were Spock and Kirk doing on that planet being chased by indigenous people? What were they stealing, and why?Where is the civilian leadership on Earth? They never appear.Why did Khan attack the meeting in his helicopter with machine guns rather than, say, missiles, which would have been more lethal? Related, why was the emergency meeting held above-ground in a room with floor-to-ceiling windows rather than in a secure location? How convenient for Khan (and the writers!).It's impossible to beam someone from Earth to Kronos, it's simply too long a distance. It's not even possible to do this far into the future when TNG takes place. Ah, but so convenient to move the story along.After Scotty resigned, why wasn't another engineer promoted to Chief engineer? Surely he and his little alien friend weren't the only two engineers aboard the Enterprise. But it's awfully convenient for giving Chekov something to do in this film.Kirk, who was orbiting Kronos, was able to call up Scotty's mobile device when Scotty was in a bar on Earth. Apparently the Enterprise had communications, so then why didn't Kirk contact anyone and everyone at Starfleet to inform them of his situation?We are supposed to believe that Scotty is able to fly right up to an ultra top-secret hangar without being detected? How is a person with a normally functioning brain supposed to accept this? I understand that it's sci-fi, but there is still common sense in the Star Trek universe that must be contended with.The Enterprise seems to return to Earth from Kronos in about 10 minutes. It takes 4 days at warp 4 to cover this distance, as established in ""Enterprise"" episode ""Broken Bow"" (and no ""reset"" of the Star Trek universe can change that, thank you very much). Related, when the Enterprise is attacked it suddenly drops out of warp right next to Earth? How...-- there's that word again -- convenient.Lastly, the dialogue was atrocious and grating. ""Goes south."" ""Epic."" ""Ass handed"" to him. It is the slang of our time, sure, but it won't be far into the future. In TNG no one said things were ""cool"" and in TOS we never heard ""groovy."" The writers of those series understood that to use such slang terms would yank the audience out of the story, which is set in the distant future.I believe an explanation for the above flaws and others is that this film is Star Trek in name only. Everything about this film is meant to make it a box-office hit, to make it popular with large audiences. Star Trek has never been able to accomplish this before because at its best Star Trek doesn't pander to the masses. Think of what are often considered the best TNG episodes, such as ""The Inner Light"" and ""The Measure of a Man."" These episodes offer sci-fi storytelling with no explosions, no action set-pieces, and no lowest-common-denominator dialogue. Instead, these episodes are thoughtful explorations of what it means to be human and as a result they touch people as the best Star Trek often does. This film and its predecessor are grotesque distortions of Star Trek, and I'm glad Gene Roddenberry can't see what a monstrosity his creation has been twisted into for the sake of popularity.",Star Trek Into Darkness
797,budi-satrio-85,The best star trek,10,6 January 2015,"Star Trek Into Darkness is actually movie I've been waiting for. Amazed by how refreshing and coolness of the first movie, I waited for this movie like 4 years. And after I watched it, it's simply amazing! All the funny, cool, anger, sad, and twist moments are there.First, Neytiri speak klingon language! Oh sorry, it's Uhura. Haha, I think Zoe Saldana got her role to speak Klingon because of her accent in Avatar :PSecond, the USS Enterprise is real! I mean they showed us all the rooms, I can feel exploring what's inside it.The comedy and jokes are a lot, it's more funny than Iron Man 3 in my opinion.The sad moments are there too, when you have to choose your way to sacrifice your life in order to save your crew. Coupled with the feeling when your best friend died, you want to take revenge of him.The action was top notch, there's no way I could imagine USS Enterprise falling down to earth like that. The fight too was amazing, all those punch added with vengeance and anger, it feels like ""punch him! punch him hard! until his face broken!"" oops, too barbar I think.The chemistry between characters is authentic. I can feel the love of Uhura to Spock, the friendship between Kirk and Spock, which is like oil and water actually, since Spock is very logical while Kirk is very intuitive. Added with some deep lines Spock told why he has no feeling facing his death, this movie is perfect.There is one line that Spock told which suits my condition. He said he choose not to feel anything before his death, since he has felt fear and death and those sadness around it. I too have feeling like that regarding my relationship. Oh, I think I talk too much of me.. Anyway, it's good movie and I recommend you all to watch it.",Star Trek Into Darkness

799,IllyaBenkard,Star Trek series remain in the same path to be followed since the first reboot of 2009,7,17 March 2014,"I watched the first Star Trek and I thought it was a worthy film to watch. The story telling was different than the previous Star Trek movies and series. It was a daring reboot that ended up going quite well, despite the complaints that the franchise became too ""Hollywoodish"", what means fast paced and with some explicit violence. J.J. Abrams embraced this project and put his very known trademarks on it. The dazzling lens flares combined with vivid and colorful backgrounds are an eye-candy to a rather corny, yet Star Trek signature plot: villain shows up, does something bad, the brash Captain James Kirk and his crew go to the rescue, no matter how many rules they broke. New villain shows up and the previous villain is the key to defeat this new villain. Something on Enterprise goes wrong, engineering finds something magical to make the ship work as brand new, big battle ensues with all that well known bridge chatter and command chain dialog and everything goes well in the end.***** SPOILER ALERT *****Although predictable, the plot is makes you keep at the edge of the seat through the whole movie. Apart from some minor holes, it fits well to a Star Trek movie. There are some remarkable and jaw dropping scenes, with a honorable and well deserved mention to the one where the Vengeance reaches the Enerprise in Warp and engages it close range, displaying how flawlessly executed the visual effects were.***** SPOILER ENDS *****As for the soundtrack, Michael Giacchino and his team, whose work have been praised before in gaming, on Medal of Honor and Call of Duty series, does an amazing job while re imagining the movie's main theme and it's canonics throughout the story playtime. The main theme itself already displays how powerful and catchy is his work. The use of his orchestra just adds to a great potential franchise reboot.The audio is nothing to be greatly impressed with. The audio effects are what to be expected from a Star Trek movie. The very remarkable sound of the Phasers and other weaponry of Starfleet ships bring back the most tender memories to any hardcore Star Trek fans. The voice work on the crew androids are to be also mentioned here. That's some amazing voice work.Visually the movie is sufficiently fine worked with the touch of J.J. Abrams attention bringing use of anamorphic lens flares. Also the camera sudden zooms play good effect on some dramatic moments throughout the piece. The enterprise has a clean and nice high technology design and portrayal, differing from the retro depiction of the previous Star Trek series. Some innovations like the Palm Top used by Captain Picard in The Next Generation series are a lacking in this movie, although there's enough holographic screens all around to remind us that we are in a far future.External visuals are gorgeous. The planet Nibiru visuals are impressive, as well as the other locations shown, like the Starfleet HQ at San Francisco. Some good work was used there and there was no harm in the space scapes as well. Praise to Bad Robot and team by their incredible work.Let's talk about the acting, while not flawless, it's convincing enough to make us believe that things are actually happening. Anton Yelchin appearances, albeit short, are very rewarding as he delivers well what would be a teenager working at the engineering of one of the most advanced ships in the Starfleet. Chris Pine goes decently in the role of James Kirk, but Zachary Quinto really wins it when we are talking about being a Mr. Spock. Cold and calculist, he strives to hide his feelings to take the best logical decisions as the First Officer of the Enterprise. I watched both Spocks and I must say: Quinto is really good.In an overall the movie is great. It may not bring full excitement from hardcore Trekkies, but me myself, as a just a Trekkie fan, enjoyed the ride. It's a good piece of work that, in my opinion, is worth spending two hours and a half to watch.Plot: 7,2 of 10Acting: 8,4 of 10Visual Effects: 8,2 of 10Audio: 7 of 10Music and Soundtracks: 8,8 of 10Eye-Gripping factor: 8,0 of 10Space depiction: 8,5 of 10**********************************Final Rating: 8,0 of 10 (worth watching)",Star Trek Into Darkness
800,neo_701,"Good, really good. But not great.",7,11 May 2013,"First of all, let me state that I recently saw Iron Man 3 and I've enjoyed Star Trek Into Darkness WAY more than the first. Why? Because it is plain and simple a very good movie. Iron Man, in my opinion, is not.One more thing: For everybody who compares this Star Tek movie to ""Wrath of Khan"": Into Darkness takes place way earlier in Trek-continuity than the ""original"" second Star Trek movie! You must compare it to the episode ""Space Seed"" from TOS, because that's when the Enterprise first discovers Khan in space. In the time-line from J.J. Abrams' movie, Khan and his crew just hasn't been found by Kirk and his crew and so everything happens as it happens in the film ...But now into detail:The Good:The acting. Benedict Cumberbatch simply is PERFECT. Zachary Quinto and Zoe Saldana, Peter Weller, Simon Pegg and John Cho are also great. And even Chris Pine shows that he can act (no, really). The CGI. There is so much action happening in this movie and you do not ONCE think of it not being real. I guess that's the best you can say about CGI used in a film. There's one exception, though: See ""The Ugly"".The script. Adapting one of the most famous story lines/villains in Star Trek history is risky, to say the least. They did it very well. Cumberbatch's Khan is scarier than Ricard Montalban's and even though it's hard to believe that a Star Trek Admiral is even a bigger lunatic than Khan, at the end it all comes together fine. The chemistry between Kirk and Spock with all its tension is well scripted, too The dialogue. Yes, I know, this is also part of the script, but it deserves a special note. Funny, emotional ... and sometimes epic. 'nuff said.The Bad:The side characters. Bones, Chekov, Scotty. In this movie, they are just here to ... be here. Especially Chekov is so ""unnecessary"" that they take him as a substitute to Scotty in Engineering?! I'm sure that aboard a starship there is at least one other person who is more qualified than a helmsman(!) to be Acting Chief Engineer? And Scotty as a ""Secret Agent""? Doesn't work for me. Next time, please involve more of the crew members in the actual main plot!The plot holes. This contradicts my praise for the script a bit, but I just wanted to point out that there are some really ridiculous scenes: John Harrison tells Kirk his real name and he calls himself just ""Khan""? Not ""Khan Noonien Singh""? Who would do it like that? Not me! Scotty can get aboard Admiral Marcus' ship undetected? I don't think so! Khan is not able to scan his torpedoes for lifeforms, when he beams them aboard? No way! A helmsman becomes Chief Engineer? But I had that one already ...Leonard Nimoy. Why was he in the film??? His scene was really unnecessary and even more ridiculous than the ones mentioned above. So will young Spock call his older self in each and every movie to come? And will Nimoy-Spock tell Quinto-Spock everything he wants to know? Frankly, I don't care: Please get rid of Obi-Wan-Kespock!The Ugly:The Beaming. There were so many great special effects - and then the beaming of people looks like they got caught in a bunch of wool? I don't get it ...The Showdown. I was a bit disappointed by the way, Abrams & Co did the final battle between Khan and Spock. I think, a villain like that shouldn't be defeated on top of a car. Khan deserves more.The 3D. Just. Totally. Unnecessary.That's it: Seven Stars, period.",Star Trek Into Darkness
801,mailtemp1234,A good start,6,13 May 2013,This was a good movie but... It did not have the originality of the first. I was expecting a bit more of the overall action build ups the first had but this movie seems a bit disjointed at times. All sci-fi steals from previous shows and this did it a lot. I think to many ideas were taken from too many other sci-fi topics especially past sequences in Star Trek and not enough new ideas were introduced. Overall it was a good show .. I went with high expectations so that is why I felt a bit empty at the end of it. If I had low expectations like I do for most movies I would have liked it more. I saw the 3D version and wished I didn't. I rarely get the benefit from 3D anymore and find it a bit distracting in some movies it stops me enjoying the details in the storyline. I think Avatar 2 will be the only 3D for me in the future. The Enterprise does not fire a single shot in this movie which is my final criticism.,Star Trek Into Darkness
802,mads-madsen,Poor,4,29 September 2013,"I didn't like this film. I found it predictable and boring. I've seen too many of this kind of film by now, and every time I come out in the other end feeling empty and disappointed. I really should have known better. To me good sci-fi is a combination of reasonably believable tech, good story-writing, great character-development and plenty of suspense. This film had none of it. Granted; It's got loads of cool explosions, a very good Cumberbatch, and a Simon Pegg who made me smile, but apart from that I found the whole thing quite laughable and childish. It wasn't even a good space-opera.The tech is not believable: Maybe that's OK. Maybe that's just what star-trek is all about (what do I know), but it doesn't have one shred of credibility which just get's annoying in a film that doesn't have anything else going for it.The story-writing is thin: Random, somewhat contrived and illogical and submitting to cliché after cliché.No character-development: All characters - pretty much - are wooden, flat, two-dimensional. I didn't care for any of them - possibly a bit for Spok, but that's maybe because I already knew him. Kirk was just plain irritating.No suspense: The one thing you can hope for in a film like this, is a fair deal of suspense. But there was none in my view - none at all. Not that there wasn't plenty of opportunities. But maybe that was the problem - too many opportunities and not enough time to dwell properly at any of them.All in all, I'm giving it a 4.",Star Trek Into Darkness

I forgave it because people were talking about Star Trek again.I was very reluctant to even see Into Darkness because I was afraid that the Star Trek that I know and love so well would be taken even farther away from me. Would they put in a sex scene? Drugs? What if there wasn't a single scene in a conference room?Thankfully, Into Darkness did everything right that the 2009 did wrong; and kept the good stuff, too. Most importantly, the movie remembered that Star Trek is 90% about good characters making difficult decisions and supporting each other like a family. That wasn't there in the first movie, but here: we see our old familiar pantheon of Star Trek heroes each stepping up in unique ways to contribute to the success of the missions.

While it'll get very few marks for originality considering that its plot is a smörgåsbord of episodes and movies past, the movie chugs along at a blistering pace and is riveting and thrilling to boot. It helps that the actors have internalized the quirks and mannerisms of their original namesakes. A great watch for Trekkies like me but I'm not sure how much a first time viewer will like it or even BELIEVE a certain ridiculous plot twist adapted from an earlier movie. (Seriously! Out of all the plot twists out there they had to choose the weakest one?)Come to think of it the movie pays homage to more than one movie starring the original crew - saying more will be giving it away.Nonetheless, J J Abrams manages to keep things interesting throughout and Benedict Cumberbatch owns the scene whenever he's on screen and makes an otherwise flimsy story work. The bromance between Quinto and Pine lends a much needed human (or is it Vulcan?) touch to the proceedings and prevents the film from degenerating into mindless action and set pieces. Too bad Abrams won't be returning for Episode 3 and will be concentrating on Episode 7 of another well known sci-fi movie series instead. Despite that, the franchise should live long and prosper if the new director builds on this movie and continues with the story arc. Despite its lack of originality it's still one of the better Star Trek movies to come out in recent times.",Star Trek Into Darkness
805,warnerdang,Mixed Bag,7,14 December 2017,"Listen, this movie is a mixed bag just like most films these days that are either sequels, imaginations or in this case, both.It's not that this movie is bad per say, it's just that it's not new. If you are new to Trek, you will enjoy this. If you're a fanboy, listen to Shatner's advice and ""get a life"". If you're somewhere in the middle like me, grew-up with it, watched it all, enjoyed it; you may or may not like this movie.I found it entertaining and the talent was not too bad. Some of the ideas were OK, but again nothing fresh.At the end of the day it's a solid 6.5 because of it's lack of vision and depth. If you want to understand why this movie is the way it is, go watch Wrath of Khan, arguably the best Trek movie and one of the best pieces of science fiction ever put together.",Star Trek Into Darkness
806,stu-brady,the best star trek film,9,7 September 2013,"Wow what a film, having seen all the films this one is the best by far.It takes things beyond the reboot movie and expands on the characters.One point to mention is Simon Pegg is good in this film but having just seen worlds end I was amazed how young he looks in this movie, the magic of the movies I guess.By far the best part of the film is were the enterprise crashes through the clouds only to reappear later, a brilliantly shot piece. I await more films with hope as things can only get better.Lets hope JJ does not leave it too long for the next oneOne final thought is how gutted must William Shatner be having missed out in being in these like Spoke is.",Star Trek Into Darkness
807,thomaszangerllux,What happened to good screen writing ?,3,19 May 2013,"I am a long-term Trekkie and went into this movie fairly open-minded and full of expectation, perfectly seeing the need to adapt a franchise to the taste of a modern audience. It didn't disturb me either that the movie was shown in 3D, although I don't really consider it a big plus as the storytelling remains the most important aspect of a movie for me.I don't take offense of the many action scenes and relatively violent fight sequences that are not very ""Star Trek"" like, but which are probably needed to appeal to a younger audience.Unfortunately, it was the storytelling that disappointed me most. The plot was awfully unimaginative by basically just retelling ""The Wrath of Khan"" with a few plot parameters changed. What's even worse is the dialog that, as other reviewers pointed out, is at times hideously cheesy and other times just doesn't fit into the Star Trek canon (""For the love of God"",...).At one point Spock tells the villain that he needs to be stopped because otherwise he would kill anybody whom he considers ""less than superior"", a non-expression (superior compared to whom?) that a logically reasoning character like Spock would never use. At other times characters use replaceable standard-phrases that you could find in any B-movie and that are unintentionally funny (""It's good to have a family"", ""Because you are my friend, Spock."", ""Let's go after the bastard"")Overall, it is one of the worst screen writing that I have recently been subjected to.What makes the weak story even more a pity is that the technical execution of the movie is good. The film seems to have had a really good art direction, with nice and imaginative settings and both stunning and believable visuals throughout the movie. Other technical aspects of the movie, like the editing our the score were top-notch as well.Hence, with a better, more imaginative story, this could have really been an enjoyable, if not deep, movie. Sadly, as it is, I can not recommend it to any Trekkie.",Star Trek Into Darkness
808,sturgeon3736,Wanted more,6,17 May 2013,"I was really excited to see the new Star Trek. Yes, it hit the ground running, and the first half delivered everything I wanted. BUT, with the big reveal in the second half, it became hollow and clichéd. I wanted so much more from this film and know that JJ and crew can do it. Why did they opt for that path? The first installment was fantastic, blew my mind. Now I'm wondering what happened. Dialog and characters were fairly good, but some lines could've packed more punch or been less strained. Example, the Bones lines we've all come to love: ""Damn it, Jim, I'm a doctor, not a..."" While delivered as best as possible by a very capable actor, should've been written better. Talk about awkward lines! As an author of 8 novels and a fledgling screenwriter, I think JJ needed to rethink this storyline. Don't take so much from the past. You've completely changed the space-time continuum, so rock with it and give us fresh content. Will I see another installment? Heck yeah, but don't make the same mistakes. Oh, yes, and enough of the lens flares! A few are OK, but that was getting downright annoying.",Star Trek Into Darkness
809,Gsean20,A fantastic film,9,19 May 2013,"J.J. Abrams Star Trek debut was a huge success and making a film of equal quality for the sequel is a task. But Abrams and company have brilliantly risen to the occasion with a intense, fun, and thrilling film with a story that brings to mind a post 9/11 atmosphere. Chris Pine, Zach Quinto and the rest of the cast are outstanding, breathing even more life into the already iconic characters they portray. Benedict Cumberbatch burns up the screen as the much debated villain, definitely a star making turn for the great British actor. The story is good, allowing the characters to develop and grow, and the story has a very deep emotional core. The film is in my opinion a little bit action heavy, but the sequences are brilliantly well done. Special effects are outstanding, matching the atmosphere that the story and actors set up. Don't miss this one.",Star Trek Into Darkness
810,bartenderbilly60,Just... sigh... awful...,5,23 May 2014,"I'd like to start out by saying that the only reason I rated this movie as high as I did is due to the excellent acting. The cast of this movie did an amazing job! Don't let the low star rating lead anyone to think that I found their work to be anything less than exemplary. It's not an easy task to take on such iconic roles but the actors did it perfectly. I hope that the sucking hole that is this movie only motivates Hollywood to write better projects so that this ensemble can reprise these roles in better movies.If you're a fan of being let down by an unnecessary continuation of a franchise for the sake of trying to squeeze a little bit more money out of it than this movie is for you! It has everything needed to really upset fans of the Star Trek universe! They tried MUCH too hard to connect this piece of movie to The Wraith of Khan, a masterpiece that is easily the best in the series. Connecting a bad movie to a good one does not always work guys. The Transitive Principle of Cinema is a lie. This film is proof.",Star Trek Into Darkness
811,RonnyLinthout,NOT Star Trek: the Matrix meets the Terminator,1,22 August 2013,"Just watched this piece of crap. Except for the names of the main characters this has nothing to do with the original Star Trek franchise, nor the Roddenbery vision.Completely humorless, no real interaction between the main characters and computer graphics to the max. JJ Abrams should be banned from touching it (oh and Tim Burton as well). Yes it's fast moving, but the characters are completely lost in the special effects and over-the-top background, in fact they look like miniatures !I usually get a warm smile on my face when I see one of the original members of the series, but in this case not. WHY Nimoy was used in this movie I can't answer. He surely did it for the money, even in a cameo role that has no meaning to the story.What I loathed was the fact that they used the ending of ""The Wrath of Khan"", although this time with Kirk 'sacrifcing' himself and Spock the one on the outside. It misses the effect it had with the original cast members. Why they took this great scene and 'raped' it is beyond my understanding.I'd rate it ""0"" but 1 is the lowest rate. If they're so fond of computer effects, make not a new one BUT... use the faces of the original series through the much loved computer graphics !Even the webseries ""Star Trek: Phase II"" is better than this movie. At least that series has heart, remained true to the original format and is obviously done with greatest care and LOVE for what Gene Roddenberry created.",Star Trek Into Darkness
812,adrien-jb,Don't understand the Negative Reviews - solid Trek movie better than most.,9,19 June 2013,"I swore after seeing Thor in 3D that I would never go to another 3D movie. 3D was the only option for ST Into Darkness - and it really works. Wished I had seen it in IMAX now. I really enjoyed this movie. I was at school when the first series was aired. Watched most of the franchise and all of the movies. All of which were between just okay to most excellent. Stand out for me: Series 1, Insurrection, the Archer prequel, Wrath of Khan and First Contact. The action was satisfying. The baddie was awesome. The main plot was good, the human interest sub-plots present and sometimes laugh out loud good to me, the heroic journey plot (Kirk) was woven through it, and the movie develops the relationship of the characters. All bodes well for the future. Loved the reboot. It needed to be done. Look, when Series 1 was made Apollo was the only space programme that was vaguely aimed at something other than sub-orbitally delivered Mutually Assured Destruction. Buses, schools and toilets in America were still segregated. Martin Luther King helped to make sure that Lt.Uhura took the role so a future could be portrayed with an officer on the bridge that was a Negro. The idea that the only good Russian was a dead Russian was very popular during that period of the Cold War. So Series 1 beamed a different picture directly into young minds where science builds and not destroys, that the Cold War is a thing of the past, along with racial discrimination. That's what makes series 1 10/10 for me. And this backdrop has changed - not to mention the science having made some of the guesses look a bit dated. The negative reviews puzzle me. Most of them (about 80%) are single reviews. They have reviewed no other movies. That makes them difficult to trust in any way shape or form. They may even just be a single reviewer with multiple email addresses. Then half of the rest, their reviews and ratings are for movies I have never heard of, or barely heard of. Can't trust them either. Then the remainder seem to be to be from perfectionists, that ""if only I were in charge then..."". To those perfectionists a quote: ""Perfection is the enemy of good"" Voltaire. A good movie - not a perfect one. Like every other movie, book, story, fiction, you lay aside your critical faculty and enjoy it for what it really is. Star Wars is really enjoyable because it is a story about the struggle of good versus evil. The Matrix is enjoyable because it is the struggle of a sleeping man dreaming they're awake to awaken to their full potential. Shawshank Redemption is really good because it is a story of Red's journey to break free from fear and recover hope. To miss the core element in any movie is to miss the whole point of the movie. And this movie is really enjoyable because it is a good romp, with likable characters, awesome baddies, and it is fun. If you don't like it because it is not a great or perfect movie then get off your behind and make movies that are better. Otherwise enjoy them for what they are, just like we have to enjoy our children - for what they are. Not a great movie, but a good one. Re-watchable. I will buy it to add to my collection. 9/10",Star Trek Into Darkness
813,gibhk,very disappointing and bewildering,2,22 May 2013,"I really couldn't wait to get out of there. I am a Star Trek fan from the original, emphasis on the word 'original', TV series and found the first remake in this series enjoyable, but this was just abysmal. Simon Peggs Scottishness just drove me up the wall - of course, he is not actually a Scot. The constant attempts at humour became nauseous - this is not supposed to be a comedy, but it bordered on it at times. The constant bam bam bam fisticuffs ridiculous. The throwback to an earlier Star Trek movie a first-order groan inducer. I really have no idea what the hell this was all about. I truly despair. There is so much great scifi material out there and these guys have to rehash and rehash. Please give us something original and exciting and thought-provoking. This definitely was not it. I am being generous giving it 2 out of 10.",Star Trek Into Darkness

815,abhis007,Star Trek Into Darkness: A voyage that continues to excel!,8,12 May 2013,"Star Trek Into Darkness begins with crew of the USS Enterprise locked in an adventure on the planet Nibiru. The movie starts off at a fast pace as Captain James Kirk (Chris Pine) and Dr. McCoy (Karl Urban) are chased by the planet's inhabitants, while Spock (Zachary Quinto) is trying to stop an erupting volcano. Eventually, this initial adventure leads to Kirk breaking one of the Prime Directives and setting things in motion for the adventures to follow. The Starfleet is at this time facing an attack by a new nemesis who is identified as John Harrison (Benedict Cumberbatch), a Starfleet member himself. Captain Kirk is allowed to venture on in search of Harrison by Admiral Marcus (Peter Weller) and that is how the Enterprise crew of explorers are turned into a group of combatants. Harrison is though not who he seems to be, and as things develop, one is rendered deeper and deeper into an intriguing plot which evokes admiration, love, rage and a sense of honour above it all. Bonds are tested more than once, between friends, between lovers, between students and mentors. And by the end of it all, only the toughest and strongest bonds are meant to survive. The script written by the original team of 2009's Star Trek, Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman, along with new joinee, Damon Lindelof, forms the heart of the movie. While Star Trek explored the origins of two of the central characters, Kirk and Spock, their differences and their similarities,Star Trek Into Darkness brings into focus the challenges in their friendship due to the vast differences in their personalities. And yet it in no way holds back to bring forth the admiration that they have of each other, and how they will stand up for one another when required. In one of the most emotional scenes of the movie, Spock speaks out his heart to Kirk (in the small way that he can) saying, ""Because we are friends!"" and that is when you realise the extent of their love for each other. If you are asking whether this is a James Kirk film or a Spock film, you are asking the wrong question. Star Trek Into Darkness belongs to them both, unquestionably, and makes for one of the best partnerships between two leading male actors, ever seen. With the excellence of the script, follows the excellence of the director, J.J. Abrams. His masterclass was in display with Star Trek and his reputation remains untarnished with the sequel. Abrams masterfully blends in emotions in an action-filled sci-fi flick, in a manner only a few can. His understanding of the bonds between different characters is there to be seen, whether he shoots a scene with Kirk and Spock, or Spock and McCoy, or Kirk and Sulu, or Uhura and Spock. The camera placements are perfect, the scenes showcasing the vastness of space are extraordinary, and especially the battle between two starships at warp speed is worth highlighting. The movie is filled with quality acting from start to end as was the case with the previous Star Trek. Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto have matured as actors as have their characters in the course of these two movies and for the new generation of watchers, they will always be James Kirk and Spock. As is with their characters, Pine and Quinto seem to add something more to each other when they are together in a scene than when separate, and this conflict of gut feelings of Krik and logic of Spock when combined, truly completes things. The rest of the crew of the Enterprise complement the duo at every step, making them appear rightly as a 'family'. Dr. McCoy has some of the best one-liners in this one and his cynicism brings another shade of colour to the movie. Uhura, Scotty, Sulu and Chekov, each have their moments to shine, testing their strength to rise on the occasion, and along with the characters so do the actors with aplomb. Admiral Pike is lovable as always, and Peter Weller as Admiral Marcus enjoys good screen time and makes a strong impression overall. Coming to Benedict Cumberbacth, he is a name to remember, if you have not done so yet. Many will recollect him from the TV Series Sherlock. You will hear him in the Hobbit trilogy as he voices the dragon Smaug. You will meet him this year itself when he plays Julian Assange in The Fifth Estate. And you will never forget him once you have seen Star Trek Into Darkness. Cumberbacth is one of the upcoming stars in Hollywood, talented to the core and has a screen presence which is electrifying to say the least. His role really kicks off in the second half of the movie but when it does, oh boy, he dwarfs the rest. Playing a character filled with pride, rage and ambition, Cumberbatch seems to simply will himself to be that person and enacts it with such ease that you forget he ever played a charming but annoying Sherlock Holmes. Great things can be expected from this young British actor. Star Trek Into Darkness, in short, is more than just a sci-fi movie and keeps the essence of Star Trek alive. It raised no eyebrows when J.J. Abrams was offered to direct the next of the Star Wars movie, for no one else can touch the right emotional chords in a sci-fi movie than him. While many would be jubilant to see Star Wars in safe hands and awaiting the planned 2015 release of the next movie, today one just feels a pinch of sadness that the next Abrams directed Star Trek movie cannot be seen soon. What path does the Enterprise take from here on, one does not know. But is that not the point of the starship's adventures after all? To seek the unexplored! So till we hear from the crew once again, live long and prosper!",Star Trek Into Darkness
816,steve-668-198948,Great Movie,10,19 May 2013,"I'm 57 years and a bit of a weekend trekker so I start out a bit biased, this is without confusion in saying out loud it's the best movie in any field I've seen (I've seen about every movie there is). A great story and acting was top of the range, the way to destroy the old star trek is to do a better therefore more memorable star trek and they have done it, no more looking back on ""the good ol days"" I'm now prepared to move on to this more realistic genre and all that it holds for the new 5 year plan. For me the more understated the acting and every day special effects the more time there is to immerse into the story, this does this superbly. It's hard to get past the moment and this Star Trek is the start of something great. A truly fantastic movie, I watched in 3D.",Star Trek Into Darkness
817,cary-forbes,Worth the Couple of Hours,8,19 May 2013,"My wife and I went to see this movie over the weekend, and thoroughly enjoyed it. As a long term Star Trek fan who owns all the TV series, all the movies, dozens of books etc. I will admit that it did take me a little while to accept the alternate timeline/universe, but once I did I was able to see this movie, and ""Star Trek"", in a more positive light. I really like the Kirk, Spock, and McCoy characters, and in particular like what they are doing with Kirk and Spock and the way they are building that relationship. The other characters are fine, although I will admit to not being as fond of Scotty. The story I thought was good, but still had some serious flaws. The movie didn't really seem to bog down anywhere, and was kept moving at a decent clip throughout, the action sequences and more dialogue related scenes in good balance. I love the duty uniforms too. The colours and material look good on the big screen. The few things that irked me were a) the ""ooh aah"" technology factor. I find it hard to believe that in the 21st century we can't step out of a department store without an alarm going off if the security tag on our purchase has not been deactivated, but somehow in the 23rd century Scotty can sneak a shuttle into a spacedock where they are building a ""battleship"" in secret with no alarms being raised, and then sneak on board the vessel itself. Go to the airport and try to get on a plane without the proper identification etc. these days. Surely they can do better in the 23rd century. b) After the nature of the initial attack on Starfleet, would the leaders of Starfleet really have met in such an unsecure location? Not likely. c) How did they get from Kronos back to Earth so quickly? d) Why did ""young"" Spock really need to find information about Khan from ""old"" Spock. As Khan had been frozen long before the split in the timeline, wouldn't there have been computer records explaining all about Khan and the Eugenics Wars that ""young"" Spock could have referenced? As a matter of fact, shouldn't ""young"" Spock have known anyway, considering his vast knowledge, especially about a conqueror as evil as Hitler? I think this may just have been a way of getting our old and beloved friend Leonard Nimoy into the movie. I'm sure that he gave his younger self good advice, but was it really unnecessary? e) It's not really feasible that the admiral in command of Starfleet could actually do what he did without being discovered. After all, could you imagine General Werner Freers (the NATO Chief of Staff) being able to do the same thing today? Again, you would think that as the centuries go by, security would be be getting better. I have a bit of a problem with this anyway. Military people swear to uphold the oath they take, and while some may deviate (and very few), it really doesn't seem possible that such a senior officer with such great responsibility would stray so much from the path. If you know any officers, you'll understand what I mean. This part of the story to me seemed to show little respect for the military and those who serve, and while Starfleet is principally about exploration, the capital starships, like the Enterprise, are run like naval vessels, and are very heavily armed. The writers should remember that. Admiral Marcus did have the best intentions to begin with. Any officer wants his personnel to be the best armed they can be, and wanting the Federation to have the best weapons is a only natural (remember what Vegetius said ""If you want peace, prepare for war""), but unfreezing a mass murderer like Khan would have been like the West resurrecting Hitler and his disciples to win the Cold War.......not a good idea. This would have been better all around if they have made the traitor in their midst a politician.......that I'm sure we can all understand. f) What is it with the messy engine room? What is shown on screen doesn't even look like it would all fit in the ship when you look at it from the exterior. It looked too much like an engine room on a warship from today, not the 23rd century. Still, with all my gripes, I enjoyed the movie, and will be looking forward to the next one. Hopefully this movie, and the third in the trilogy, will make enough at the box-office that we will get another reboot in the years to come, maybe with the timeline that we all have come to love being continued. I think it's worth remembering that if Gene Roddenberry had been alive when ""Star Trek"" was released a few years ago, he would have insisted that the timeline be repaired.",Star Trek Into Darkness

However I was pleasantly surprised after watching the two latest installments. The story lines weren't difficult to follow but were gripping at the same time. There was humour and jokes in certain places that were well timed and kept pace with the action. The visual effects were spectacular. The role of Spock was portrayed brilliantly. Bennedict Cumberbach also added an element of mystery to the film. My only criticism is that it had to end! I would definitely recommend watching this film. Overall, great film, great action, a brilliant watch.",Star Trek Into Darkness
819,chrisleary186,Something is Lacking,3,13 May 2013,"This was great to watch, but don't know about 3D as the screen kept having to focus on a lot of shots and also that there were a lot of close ups showing all the creases on all their faces. I waited a long time for this and was unimpressed firstly by the score and how it kept repeating again and again the same tune over and over again. I can't decide if an actual score was made or they just copied it exactly from the first start trek movie. The score needs to be rethought to give the films an edge along with a better looking bridge as it looks like it was created in a holding program in the matrix. There was a rumor that Khan was in the film and we know what happens to him from the original series. What happens to him in this one??? they don't show you! Please come up with an original story line!! If you are going to reinvent or re-imagine films then do not bring back old story lines or characters! Someone was right about Chris Pine in his uniform looking like a ken doll. I enjoyed watching and Mr Spock whose hair kept jumping up and down as he ran.

820,boramoya,Strong on action weak on plot,2,23 May 2013,"I saw this yesterday afternoon and was really looking forward to it but was very disappointed by this film. The film lacked the story line of the first and like so many sequels that to come out of Hollywood relied on hyped up action and loud bangs to cover a very week plot...why do film makers always do this, yes action is important within films such as this but this should there to support and complement a good plot. When I watched the first I really had to concentrate on in order to understand what was going on and I also did feel for the characters, in this film I almost fell asleep and by the end I really did not care who won. The ending of this film does however does leave the way open for a another sequel that can only be an improvement on this travesty.

The nuances and subtleties of the original Star Trek have been replaced by dumbed down action. It seems that the director has zero respect for the audience and just shoves mindless fighting scenes down our throats. The 3D action makes you feel like you are watching a video game that someone else is playing. The plot is borrowed mostly from the 1982 Trek movie Wrath of Khan. The characters spend 90% of their time, running, shooting, arguing with each other and punching each other. The bottom line is there is nothing new here. Even the visuals are not convincing.

822,theskyavatar,where's the dept of the Plot,5,16 June 2013,"I think it's great that JJ Abrams is trying to get a wider audience for Star Trek. The FX's are certainly spectacular. however, the special effects get so much attention that the dept of the stories suffer, and the finer details, for which i know Star Trek best, leave much to be desired. When i saw Startrek the Beginning the first thing that popped into my head was ""I think they made a mistake, this isn't Star Wars, is it!?"". when i saw Star Trek into Darkness i thought, ""My god! they botched it again!"" You have to understand - i have always seen Star Wars as an entertaining action packed sci-fi fairytale and Star Trek as its more tempered intelligent big brother. they were always meticulous with details, especially chronologically and the stories carried a great moral content. so now i got to ask, for example... how come the klingons got their cranial ridges back, which they lost in season 4 of Startrek Enterprise, which was clearly used as the basis for the new star trek movies.so please, bring back my star trek to me - i really do not need another Star Wars. the one we already have is plenty. I need a Sci-Fi that isn't afraid of asking their audience to think about the big questions, which the latest 2 Star Trek movies clearly seem to lack.Remember, action and special effects are good... as long as the integrity of the story does not suffer from it.",Star Trek Into Darkness

It is not a great Star Trek film.",7,18 June 2013,"There is a lot to enjoy and feast on in, Star Trek: Into Darkness, the visuals are once again fizzling with a pristine look and sparking explosions, and the snappy dialogue is back. Now Into Darkness never reaches Avengers level of funny, but there is still a chuckle in seeing Mr Spock's inability to be well be ""normal"" and Scotty still provides some important comic relief. But, for me, there was something missing. I only really started to be fully engaged when I realised that Star Trek is just fun. And at the moment of typing that last sentence I could feel the Treckies slipping away from me. However, fleeing Treckies, Into Darkness stops to work when you try to squeeze some real emotion out of it. And, perhaps unfourtunatly, Star Trek: Into Darkness, is a great action film.

825,sas318,Exciting and suspenseful,10,2 October 2013,"This was meant to be a big blockbuster, entertaining, action movie, and it did just that. The whole movie was exciting, suspenseful, and thrilling - all the makings of a fun afternoon/evening at the theater.The jokes were funny, especially between Kirk and Spock and occasionally Bones. Kirk and Spock's friendship was touching, from Spock throwing Kirk under the bus to the end when Kirk was behind the radiation door. The part that was pointless was the beginning when Bones and Kirk were running through the forest and then jumping off a cliff into the water (they should've died from that jump, but hey, it's a movie).The entire cast played their characters very well. I thought Karl Urban was a terrible Dr. McCoy (because Bones was so skinny) until I heard him speak, and then I thought Karl was brilliant in mannerism, facial expression, and southern accent. Chris Pine was okay. He was good when he was being funny, but he's terrible when he's angry. That speech he gave Kahn about Kahn being alive only because he's allowing it was terrible acting; he sounded whiny, not authoritative nor angry. Zachary Quinto was a fantastic Spock. So impressed by this guy's portrayal of him. Wonderful acting. Simon Pegg as Scotty was funny. Benedict Cumberbatch didn't impress me too much. To me, he was just another actor in the movie. He didn't stand out to me at all. I rolled my eyes when he said he was Kahn. When the rest of the cast was painstakingly casted to resemble the original Star Trek cast, I have no idea why Kahn was turned into a monochromatic, Caucasian guy.Other than the acting, the entire movie was exciting and suspenseful. I loved it so much that I bought the DVD, and I never buy DVDs.",Star Trek Into Darkness
826,miller_jayme,The writer's of this movie did not use original ideas,1,15 February 2014,"As it seems like the movie takes a lot of the ""Wrath Of Khan"" writer's ideas and injects them into this Movie ""Into Darkness"". The Movie seemed like it no Original thinking behind it. The writer used quotes from the ""The Wrath Of Khan"" in the Movie ""Into Darkness"" The Actor's were well cast. In the ""Star Trek"" TV series Spock never shows emotions at all, where as in the Movie ""into Darkness"" they have Him all over the place with emotions. Lt. Uhura In ""The Undiscovered Country"" could not speak the ""Klingon Language....was as in ""Into Darkness"" She is an expert in the Language...So the the writing is inconsistent as well as not being an Original Idea. The review was low, because of previous statements.The special and visual effects were good",Star Trek Into Darkness
827,HollandSkies,Unscrupulous characters fighting a bad guy and each other,1,23 February 2014,"I guess this movie gets rated ten stars by fourteen-year-old's that play war games all day, and don't care the tiniest bit about a story line. So if you like explosions and don't care about a story, this movie is for you. But you might as well just continue playing your war games, or join the army in the first place.This movie is basically about a bunch of unprofessional asses fighting a bad guy and each other. When an extremely selfish dad kills about 500 people including himself to save only his daughter, the tone for the rest of the film has been set. There is selfish, ruthless and unprofessional behavior by all main characters during the whole movie. They are all just busy with their own personal problems and don't give a damn when other people die. For example, nobody on the bridge of the starship Enterprise seems to care the the tiniest bit when half of the crew gets killed. But when the beloved captain Kirk (who only got captain thanks to nepotism) seems to die, everyone is in utter tears. Spock even screams out of anger, and starts chasing the bad guy, who in the meantime has killed at least 100.000 people.This movie is not science fiction. Nothing inspiring is happening (although I was given false hope with the first scene on the alien planet). It's just a really cheap blockbuster scenario that does't seem to end, somehow wrapped into a science fiction jacket with a mega budget for slick graphics. The total lack of humor adds to that this is the worst movie I have seen in years.",Star Trek Into Darkness
828,wunderwood,Sorry that so many people here seem to to have missed it,1,14 June 2014,"I really loved the original series, and many of the other aspects of the Star Trek franchise. I'm amazed that so many people are willing to rate this at ten stars when it's pretty clear that this movie flat out sucked.I'm not sure what else I can do but try to help balance out the rating a minuscule bit with my own.It's clear what has happened. J.J. Abrams screwed us over with Lost, putting the plot elements on his credit card, promising to tell us what was really happening and then laughing all the way to the bank with his mediocre ending.Now, he's merrily romping through Star Trek, destroying the continuity of a couple of generations and obviously possessing little to no idea of what it means to those of us actually over 30. Star Trek was, at it's best, an intelligent series. These two movies are simply an insult...Next, fresh from his current financial victories, Abrams is off to finger-paint his way through Star Wars. God forbid.And some of you here are cheering him on.Amazing.",Star Trek Into Darkness
829,boobah-50476,A lot better than the first movie...,9,21 July 2016,"Now, the second movie in we are introduced to Benedict Cumberbatch-I mean Khan. Boy, oh boy, Khan is way more threatening than the villain in the first movie. Maybe the third bad guy will be the evilest? I guess we shall see tonight, won't we?What I Liked The beginning was super pretty, I loved it so much. That red planet looked great xD okay, the whole movie looks great. It was so pretty, and it started off action packed like the first movie. Star Trek Into Darkness had you on the edge of your seat from the first minute! I think I liked this more than the first movie because I'm now more used to the world of Star Trek...Again, like the first movie, Star Trek Into Darkness was SO funny. I love the characters so much.Into Darkness is action packed, just like the 2009 Star Trek movie. Only, the action in this one makes a lot more sense, it isn't just there to be there. The plot tossed the characters into life or death situations where they had to risk themselves for the safety of others over and over. Unlike the 2009 movie, Star Trek into Darkness raised the stakes, high. Like I said earlier, Khan is a bad guy. This movie was REALLY emotional, come on, why did they do this to us? I wanted to cry, OK? I did. Into Darkness shows how Spock and Kirk's relationship has changed. In the 2009 movie they start of hating each other (well, they were really competitive and petty XD) but by the end of Into Darkness, we finally have the close bond between Spock and Kirk. This movie was very emotional and I don't want to ruin it... so just... watch it :)Benedict Cumberbatch is one amazing actor! I might be biased because I'm a big fan of his Sherlock show (and character) but he did a great job playing Khan! I kid you not, he was threatening, evil, manipulative, A GREAT VILLAIN! Every hero story needs a great villain, and Benedict Cumberbatch delivered. As I've already said and will say again, he was way worse than the villain in the first movie. He actually had a purpose to be in the plot, he made sense. The bad guy in the 2009 movie didn't make sense.One of the reasons I think I liked this a lot better was the lack of world building. Which sounds weird... What I mean by that was Into Darkness didn't need to introduce Spock and Kirk and their crew, because the 2009 movie already did that. It wasn't as choppy as the first one because it didn't need to jump back and forth to introduce us to all of our characters. Into Darkness did have world building, but it didn't need to set up the ""world"" if that makes any sense at all.As always, the visual effects were AMAZING! I love the lasers, the color, the lighting, the alien stuff. The technology. I could just ramble forever, but again, J.J. Abrams and his team did a FANTASTIC job transporting us into the world of Star Trek.OverallStar Trek Into Darkness was a LOT better than the first movie. The characters were just as good as the 2009 movie, but they had more depth. The villain and action made sense and it was just overall... amazing.",Star Trek Into Darkness
830,iron_net,Just terrible,1,10 July 2018,"You probably either love or hate the J.J. Abrams Star Trek movies. There's little in between. However, this second movie in the new series is the one that is clearly objectively the worst. Not only is there hardly any coherent story at all. It is also obvious that most of the elements where just shoved in for the sake of providing vague references to earlier movies for those who don't really remember them. Maybe the best example is the moment where Khan reveals his name in a big build-up, a reveal that has absolutely no meaning within the movie because neither do the characters know Khan by that point nor has the name any significance beyond that. The actual plot of the movie goes something like that: There is a Starfleet admiral who who is plotting to start a war with the Klingons. There is a super soldier from the past who the admiral is unfreezing in order to let him fight against the Klingons but refuses. And there is the Enterprise crew who is trying to stop both of them. What sounds like something that could somehow work never manages to become a coherent story. The plans and intentions of the characters just don't make sense and there isn't any reveal that the plot is building up to. ""Into Darkness"" is another movie that doesn't seem to be based on an actual story but had its thin plot being thought out more or less after the fact.But the worst part about this movie is the fact that it uses the name of a classic brand of mature and enlightened television for a downright regressive effort. There are no real motives in this movie; no different approaches to complex problems or questions; no real despair and no constraints of the human condition. No conversations about incomprehensible phenomena or dilemmas. Instead, the entire movie is solely about who has the strongest punch, the biggest starship and the most snappy line. These means are the only ways to make any impact on the course of events. And whenever the movie gets too boring a starship is dropped on a city full of people to wake the audience up again. This is not even treating the audience like children. Because children are entertained by creativity, richness, emotions and heroism. This is treating us as creatively deprived and apathetic.What causes utter dismay is the sheer imbalance of expensive visual effects, the huge cast of high-class actors and rich movie sets on the one hand and the total absence of a good premise, capable writing or even a basic passion for telling a story on the screen and carry your audience along on the other hand. In fact this movie is one of the instances that make you think of all the great movies that could have been made if you had split the budget between five or even ten passionate filmmakers.",Star Trek Into Darkness
831,oakbymaple,It's solid,8,26 July 2020,"I know I saw this one in cinema when it came out and was pretty content with what I expected to be a sci-fi action movie back then.
After watching it a second time my opinion of the movie has not worsened, it might actually have improved a little here and there when comparing it to other major hollywood productions these days:The movie ticks every box when going over the sci-fi action but also the writing-checklist.
The plot has a properly developed arch with setups and payoffs. Its stakes are high and so is your investment and the suspense. There might be a plot hole here and there but they're minor in themselves and ultimately unavoidable in space anyway.
The characters show actual development and special traits and weaknesses. They actively deal with issues like friendship, love and obedience. The actors all perform really well, although the main attraction of course is Cumberbatch. I'd even go as far as saying he's the main reason for me liking the movie so much: ""My name is *Khan*""; Chills, literally!
Then there's action that can be best described as awesome with great cgi and admittedly a bit too much lens flare, a score that gets you going and lots of star trek gadgets.But isn't ""ticking every box"" a kind of weak reason to like a movie? For me personally in this case it isn't: all the parts are there and they even fit very well, I just love it!
But apart from this personal opinion it's also worth being highlighted in a broader context: nowadays multimillion hollywood productions can deal with not even looking at the checklist of basics, produce utter garbage and still be a commercial success. So why not like a movie that shows it understands and appreciates the laws of writing?One more word on the flood of 1-star reviews: I hope I showed why those are mostly unjustified from a technical viewpoint, but they seem to come from a very emotional direction anyway. Of course, none of the above mentioned traits exceed somewhat high expectations, no element of the movie blows your mind, and some weaknesses (no spoilers) should actually be discussed. But hating a solid sci-fi action movie for not enlightening you and blowing you away like Star Trek used to back in the days? That sounds very much a question of expectations and not of craftsmanship in filmmaking.",Star Trek Into Darkness

833,Culher,It just left me frustrated.....,5,8 May 2013,"I I have seen movies that I loved...movies that I hated. But I don't remember ever being that frustrated when I left the cinema after a movie. Maybe I should explain that I grew up with the original Series. Have seen the second movie of course I even read the book to it. The movies didn't need a reboot. And even more it didn't need a reboot that that didn't even declare itself as such. Why go through such length to hide the characters when it the end almost everybody already guessed who they are going to be. The moment the Name Marcus fell everything else was just to obvious. For some time during the movie I actually hoped that they would at least be original and make Khan the good guy.At least that would have given the story and original spin. So in the end I just watched them recreate the 2nd movie, only without the closeness that hat worked to well in the original movie. This crew is barley getting to know it each. And switching Kirks and Spocks place at the end only made Kirks resurrection more predictable. It is not a bad crew but they need their *own* stories! Plusside: -Cumberbatch: For me, he saved the movie, since he was the only one that really made me care about the character. - Kirk Spock: They are working on becoming the Duo that made the show to watchable. But they are not there yet. -Pegg and Urban: Great actors underused in the movie. -Uhura was at least not completely useless. -Nimoy! (Even if seeing him made me wish I was watching the original instead) Minus: -What was the point of Kirk Demotion? It did nothing for the movie -Still too much Uhura Spock couple time their fight was just boring. -Why split the crew up so many times. After the first movie I was really looking forward seeing them work as a crew. But the biggest Minus: WHY NOT USE the reboot to change things? What is the sense of making a alternative universe if even the dialogs stay the same!",Star Trek Into Darkness
834,mizzetniv,Could have been a split success,8,20 July 2021,"My y father, his friend, and I all think the film should have been two separate films, rather than the one we saw. What we agreed would have made it better was if in the first, of the now split movie, we see Khan, although we the audience nor the characters would know that, cause some mischief. We still see the father blow up the base in London. The movie would end with the ""Death"" of Pike, the reveal of Khan being the man we know him as, and Scotty learning about the USS Vengeance. In the next film, we open on the crew of the enterprise trying to find Khan. We still have the Klingon fight from the original film. Then some more action, surprise Pike still alive and he's the captain of the Vengeance. We then get the same ending.My father and his friends. Are both Trekkies and they say that it is hard to replace Riccardo. Both agree that this film isn't all that great, but they think it could have been better if it wasn't 30 stories crammed into one 2 hours long film rather than two separate movies.",Star Trek Into Darkness
835,Pee_dee,"Good overall, with distractions",8,31 May 2013,"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, but found some of the filming techniques distracting and think they took away from the enjoyment. LENS FLARES! Get rid of them... they are NOT enjoyable and detract from the overall look of an otherwise good movie. Buy a STEADYCAM if you want to do the hand-held look. Better yet a tripod or a dolly. Save the shaky shots for the occasional extreme action scenes. Many filmmakers now seem to think that distorting the color or shaking the crap out of the camera adds to the experience... It doesn't! The lens flares are a sign of Bad photography and lighting, not and enhancement. I would have rated this film 9.5 out of 10 had they not spoiled it with these ""enhancements"". J.J. Abrams is a fantastic filmmaker but he has lost his way in the photography department in my opinion. It sounds as if I didn't like the movie, but truth be told, I did. I just think they are overdoing this ""Documentary"" Style of filming. I just watched The Last Stand and found the camera work to be excellent in it, nice steady shots, slow sweeping pans and zooms, and shaky camera only in a very few shots, (but they distorted the color) Much more enjoyable.",Star Trek Into Darkness
836,psxmeup,Where no logic has gone before...,6,11 November 2013,"Star Trek Into Darkness is an entertaining romp but I shutter to think about the generational chasm separating this generation from the one that was privileged to see the original movies in theaters. Are we so jaded that we need explosions every couple of minutes? Are we so brain-dead that we miss all the logical flaws? Apparently it takes a few seconds to go to a homeworld that's 21 light years away and back. Apparently Starfleet has only 2 ships. Apparently McCoy has time to do completely irrelevant lab experiments while chaos ensues around him. Apparently it's common practice to park the mothership on an uncivilized world, needlessly risking the lives of your crew and prime directive, just for the sake of having a spectacular set piece. Star Trek Into Darkness throws logic out the window in favor of brainless action. The script was clearly written around major action sequences, with dialog and plot (holes) slapped together like patchwork.Viewers be warned: leave your brain at the door - you'll better enjoy the movie that way.",Star Trek Into Darkness

The director himself said he wanted to make a film which someone who didn't know the back story nor was a Trek fan could still watch and enjoy. This was a poor move and it shows. There are too many inconsistencies with it in terms of holding true to the Trek style where dialogue, suspense, deep plot lines were the norm and set Trek apart from most sci-fi movies. This new film is just too bang! boom! zing! and lacks enough link to the themes which made each previous Trek film (bar a few exceptions) special additions to the Trek family of films.",Star Trek Into Darkness
839,Orion5002,What on earth I just saw?,1,14 November 2013,"This is perhaps the worst Star Trek movie ever made and even the 2009 movie is better than this. It seems that Paramount wants another hero/war film and not a movie that will promote a better future and follow the true story of the Trek time line. By 24th century technology hasn't develop too much and Enterprise has to send the second officer in charge, Spok, into a suicide mission to save an ancient, far-away civilization. RPV's (Remotedly Piloted Vehicles) that are in use by the last decades of 20th century have disappear by 24th? Very convenient, but on the other hand we have a starship that can submerge and fly to the stars without a problem!! Wow great technology...It looks like an anime I used to watch when I was a child called Blue Noah, but there at least was a submarine going to space. Also some scenes looks like they are from other movies especially when a Klingon patrol ship hunts the shuttle, it reminds me of the hunting scene of Star Wars 2 when TIE fighters hunt down the X-wing rebel fighters that going to destroy the Death Star!!! Do you remember it J.J? And then what about altering history itself? Khan in the original story of Star Trek is found aboard the Botany Bay. Now he is just an alive, free-mad man and his fellow supporters are hiding inside cryogenic new-super-range-torpedoes! Again wow. And how the hell is Khan supposed to take control of the Enterprise, by remote control? And of course he can even have the only cure for somehow unknown disease that (again) the medical science hasn't advance at all by 24th century. Perhaps for Paramount it would be much better to set the story at some point where a war rages on. Another great scene is the human torpedoes of Khan and Kirk! It is known to all that a human body cannot survive at such a great speed in space. But wait, J.J Abrams has the solution: human-torpedo-suit. And what about the star ships? Mixed from Constitution class (Enterprise) to a complex design of Excelsior and Sovereign class (admirals starship), ships that not only are years beyond the time line the movie takes part but also they were made to replace obsolete technology ships. And for the end I kept the worst scene of the movie. Kirk trying to save the Enterprise enters the engineer room totally flood with radioactive energy and of course survives by a medical trick of Bones...err sorry I mean Abrams! Perhaps J.J Abrams would like to make it look like ""Star Trek II:Wrath of Khan"" but at the end he only manages to 'wake up' Khan from the grave and make him (Khan) hunt him (Abrams) to where no Man has gone before.",Star Trek Into Darkness

I have been a fan since I was 7 years old and watching it from behind a chair because I was usually sent to bed before Star trek started. I have enjoyed the other parts of the franchise but it will always be Kirk and company who have my heart, so when they announced the remake I was mortified. My fear was laid to rest with the first film. I left with a renewed interest in my old friend which had been worn down over time with DS9 and Voyger, both of which just about destroyed my love of all things Trek. But here we are with Into Darkness and I have once again been blown away with not just the effects but the acting, writing and the amazing way the story I had come to expect had been turned on it's head. I welcome seeing Chris Pine taking Kirk to a place he belonged. Zachery Quinto has brought a wonderful innocence to Spock, Karl Urban has made McCoy attractive in so many ways. And thank you Simon Pegg for adding a little extra to Scotty. The rest of the crew are just as stunning. I have no doubt Gene would have been proud of this one.",Star Trek Into Darkness
841,rjamesnj,Same Story Different Day,3,19 May 2013,"SPOILER ALERT SPOILER ALERT SPOILER ALERT Please do not read this review unless you have seen the movie or do not plan to see the movie. I do not want to ruin anyone's movie going experience.I saw this movie in 3D and Imax I want to look at the movie with out the wrapping all the flashy stuff and exploding stuff and as many say the lens flair moments. This is a hard review for me to write I love Star Trek the TV shows and most of the movies but this second in the ""reboots"" just left me wondering.First the Imax was great the 3D I can not comment on due to a vision problem that does not allow me to see 3D. Now on to a breakdown of the movie.The movie opened with what I call the Raiders of the Lost Ark scene it was almost lifted right from raiders and at that time my worry set in was I going to see anything new or was what I call the George Lucas effect going to step in and sadly we got the Lucas effect.The reboot the new time line was to give ST it's own legs the freedom to go where no other ST has gone before. And where do we find the story we are dropped right in to The Wrath of Kahhn Yes JJ did a great job hiding at least from me the fact that Kahhn was back. I stayed away from reading about the movie so I may have been one of few that was like oh he is Kahnn . So now we are going to rehash the story that we already know about. But wait there is more let's throw in a dash of ST Undiscovered country in to the mix and let's play a game of trading places with Spock and Kirk this time let's kill Kirk but at the same time let's give away how he is saved half way into the movie. This movie held nothing new nothing to boldly go where no man had gone before. We took the opening from one movie and the base story from to others.

Not that I have anything against the franchise, but I am not old enough to have been with it from the beginning and I somehow never found the time to pick it up from the start.That being said, I liked the movie. It wasn't awe sticking, but it was OK, if you're in the mood for an actiony SciFi. The plot isn't deep enough to generate a long analysis. The story is pretty straight forward and the plot twist (if that's what it was) is extremely predictable. Also, the movie kind of dragged on for me with long action, special effect riddled scenes. I realize that is part of the appeal for most SciFi movie goers, and the special effects where impeccable, but I usually loose interest during these scenes.The acting was amazing. Benedict Cumberbatch gave a stunning performance. Way above the standard for these kinds of movies, just going to show that he can really pull off any type of movie/character. The rest of the cast wasn't bad either, not at all, but it was my personal opinion that Cumberbatch sort of left them in the shadow.All in all it's not a bad movie to watch, especially if you're a Cumberbatch fan, but don't expect surprising turnings of events or thought provoking depth.",Star Trek Into Darkness
843,stuart-mccormack,Still boldly going forward,10,9 May 2013,"The original series had a LOT to say; particularly for its time.Without pontificating (show, don't tell) the original series featured a black, female officer -while Martin Luther King was still alive-, a Russian pilot -introduced only three years after the Cuban Missile crisis- and a Japanese helmsman -""only"" 21 years after WW2 and still, I think it's fair to say, at a time when Asians were broadly seen (by whites) as a lesser race-.AS a kid, I just soaked it all up. It never occurred to me that officers who were Russian, Black, Japanese and/or female were somehow unusual. We were all human, right? Sure, Spock was weird, but hey, he was way smarter than 'us'; what if it was really us that was weird, not him? Woah!And Star Trek was far from perfect. It had (and the movies still have) fist fights and a distinct tendency to treat women as sex objects. (Great to see that THAT is gone from TV now, eh?) But it also often had a really great story-line and it managed to present real ethics without moralizing. It made me think, not just watch. God, how I loved it.So, (finally) what's the point of all this long-winded preamble? (sorry)Like its ancestors, Into Darkness also has a lot to say. In particular the US response to 911 and the assassination of Bin Laden resonates in this movie.... and not in a positive light.How do we respond to attack, or the threat of attack? Do we have the right to invade alien territory when we're not at war? Do we have the right to execute an enemy without a trial? If not, what does that make us and, more importantly, where does it take us?Kirk's final speech started with these issues and could have been one for the ages; right up until they F'ed it up by duct-taping in the ""Space, the final frontier..."" bit. Sadly, that was clumsy, completely inappropriate and the only ""original"" Star Trek reference that they really, really got wrong. Up to there, I was sold.But hey, that aside, I really loved the movie.

We finally have a solid sequel for all to enjoy.I'm no Trexpert but I know common tropes like Dr. McCoy's cantankerous outbursts or the tribbles when I see them. Chris Pine is a wonderful actor but the script still hasn't furnished him with enough material or classy moments to outshine the likes of Zachary Quinto and Benedict Cumberbatch. Yes, he can bed alien babes, get into fist fights and hang from dizzying heights but we have yet to see him display the tactical skills and strength of character that made Shatner such an iconic Captain Kirk. Then again, Pine is doing very well at shouldering an immense burden. The movie is quite staggering in action and scale. Unlike the modest budgets of the space-faring action films in the 80s Abrams has been entrusted with a mind-boggling $230 million. Big money can be a big turn off since it usually implies complacency or compromise.The creators are a teeny-wee bit guilty on both counts, but a bit of pandering is forgivable. The pressure to make back the money, not to mention the moral responsibility of pleasing all the hard-core fans, must be immense. He did seem fatigued during the London stage of the publicity gauntlet and apologised in advance to those who think he has compromised on essence of Roddenberry's creation.If one tries to judge this film on the ""classic"" standard of Star Trek II: Wrath of Khan (or even The Empire Strikes Back) then it pales into comparison. This is not the nostalgia talking here: it is a fact borne out a better script, better dialogue, better editing, and superior score by James Horner.It maybe better to compare Star Trek into Darkness favourably to Episode II: Attack of the Clones. Both films start with a terrorist attack on a capital city, followed by an assassination attempt on a high-ranking political leader. The villain is then tracked across space to a remote location where genetically-altered soldiers are waiting to be activated for a war fabricated by a secondary villain. As a Lucas toy boy I must say this film is leaps and bounds better. The scene where Spock and Uhura fight a superhuman bad guy on the roof of a hovering junk ship tops the pursuit of the bounty hunter on Coruscant and brings the Spock-Uhura dynamic to a nice conclusion.The Kirk-Spock bromance is spot on once again and a scene where they bicker in an elevator brought to my mind a scene of Anakin and Obi-Wan (only much better of course).There are course numerous other visual similarities to other sci-fi and fantasy genres like Mass Effect, Battlestar Galactica, or The Avengers, which have either been imitated consciously or have (more likely) seeped in through a sort of creative osmosis. And Peter Weller appears too, 'nuff said.Despite the healthy mix of influences and sources of inspiration there is something not quite right about this film besides the obvious overuse of lens flares and over-the-top action set pieces (the film STARTS with Spock in erupting volcano!)I'm sure that critics and die-hard fans will identify the film's weaknesses in the weeks ahead. For some viewers Into Darkness may seem like a step backwards after a successful reboot; much like Quantum of Solace or Sherlock Holmes 2: Game of Shadows. Yes, there are plot holes, missed opportunities and ways this film could have been elevated to classic status had a bit more thought been put into the script/screenplay. One the biggest disappointments (for me) was not ending the film with Kirk returning to the Enterprise after a stint in hospital only to find the bridge crawling with tribbles.",Star Trek Into Darkness

I Would Even Say, it was better than the first installment, and that film first Film is an amazing film. and is just as deserving of a 10 Star Rating.

847,unsaloroglu,Die Hard in Space !,6,7 June 2013,"Well , I was very excited especially after the first movie. I watched Wrath of Khan yesterday night again and latest Star Trek to prepare myself to movie. But after the movie I can easily say , movie is below my expectations. Plot was average , action scenes was good BUT it was like die hard in Space. All the main characters was immortal and they escaped all the bad situation by hairbreadth. Also I must say ; Khan is powerful we know it from the original movie but he was also genius. All I see was Khan beating someone so where was the 2 dimensioned intelligence of Khan !Anyway , my point is 6 out of 10 for the movie , it is a good action movie with very good CGI and good 3D but I was expecting a clever movie and of course more spaceship fight. All the references from the old movie was the best part of the movie.Khannnnnnnnnnnnnnnn !",Star Trek Into Darkness
848,Hudsons_Skull,Star Trek for the masses? More like Star Trek for morons.,2,17 May 2013,"Where do I start?I'm a huge fan of the original movies and I admit, I enjoyed the 2009 film. Why? Because the well got dry and it seemed there wasn't anywhere left to go with the franchise. So, seeing as Abrams alluded to everyone that by taking the franchise back to where it all began and altering the time line, it was his intention to re-tell stories from the original ""series"" and breathe new life into them. Naturally, I thought he was talking about the original ""TV series"" from the 60's. Fine by me, because the original TV series was cool, but it's pretty much outdated.This latest movie has shown me that it's obvious he just wants to do the ""films"" of the 80's and 90's all over again, but in his own image, which is... an abundance of lens flares and people who are only good at looking pretty on screen. And that, in my opinion, is not what Star Trek is about. He even stated in an interview with Jon Stewart recently on The Daily Show, that he never was a fan of Star Trek as a child because he didn't get ""the philosophy"" of Star Trek. This movie is proof that he still doesn't get it. If he wants to make flashy sci-fi movies with no depth or substance, fine, there are plenty of scripts out there for him to make this kind of bland movie that attracts dimwitted people. So please Mr. Abrams, leave Star Trek alone, you are only making it worse.Abrams might be trying to get ""non-Trekkers"" to enjoy the franchise, but in order to do so, he is replacing everything that made Star Trek what it was in the first place. I'd love for more people to get into Star Trek, but not at the expense of my enjoyment of it. This movie has nothing more to offer than Transformers did, snazzy special effects and a story line riddled with plot holes and love/hate relationships between the characters that seem forced and unauthentic.Which brings me to my next point. Orci, Kurtzman and Lindelof. Where did these men learn to write? They use the technology of Star Trek only to advance the plot or create tension when needed. For instance, a transporter that the enemy uses can transport him light years to another planet, but the transporters on the Enterprise have a hard job locking onto a person on the planet they are orbiting, a hand-held communicator that can call someone in a bar on Earth from the Klingon home world light years away, infiltrating a top secret military base with a shuttle craft without being spotted by sensors, and the list goes on.The last part of the movie they just got so lazy that they re-created the whole death scene at the end of Wrath of Khan, but mirrored it by reversing the roles. And if that's not enough, the writers blatantly do a copy/paste of most of the dialogue like ""If we go in there we'll die, the radiation will kill us"" and ""The decontamination process is not complete, you'll flood the whole compartment.""Later on they even forget that the attributes that makes Khan's blood special, and which is needed to revive Kirk, also flows through the veins of the other 72 augments sitting in cryogenic tubes in McCoy's sick bay, the same cryogenic tubes that McCoy himself says earlier in the movie he could not risk opening without possibly killing the person inside, which could have been a solid reason to send Spock chasing after Khan in a foot- chase through downtown San-Francisco to retrieve a sample of Khan's blood, but instead, they have McCoy open a cryogenic tube and remove it's occupant in order to freeze Kirk so he can preserve his brain functions, I believe his exact words were ""Get this guy out of the cryo-tube, keep him in an induced coma."" but still, poor McCoy doesn't realize he could use that person's blood to revive Kirk. So now we are led to believe that McCoy, the same McCoy who based most of his arguments on ethics throughout the series and movies, is perfectly capable of opening one of the tubes, risking another being's life in the process, all to save another man? A little unethical if you ask me. These guys obviously don't know what the hell they are doing when it comes to writing Star Trek movies.This movie is, in my opinion, the worst in the entire series. Yes even ""The Final Frontier"", because at least Shatner had the guts to go where no other writer or director had gone before or since with that movie, by doing a story about God.",Star Trek Into Darkness

I did not want to like the the rebooted franchise, the first movie was 'ok' at best having changed sooo much from the original universe. But ""into Darkness"" is very close the perfect execution of a Star Trek film AND a perfectly made Sci-Fi movie. I cant imagine there will be many 'fan boys' that dislike the movie, but there will be some. Back to the review tho, an awesome non-stop ride with a perfect ending that even hardcore fans of the original (like me) should find pleasing. My only complaint is that my favorite quote from the original movie (the original Star trek 2: Wrath of Khan)did not make it to the new movie.

The whole point of the time travel reboot from 4 years ago was that stories can be retold without being enslaved to the original. Hence Pike. Hence Praxis. Etc. It's a different timeline - different rules.

And the acting of every character going hand in hand with the set stage turns out to be flawless. It just goes to show you exactly how far people are willing to take their dreams and make them a reality. So much effort & imagination goes in to making something like a movie look so real & feel so real. Any idea in a movie script generates all kinds of side props, and so much of energy & dedication go in to make everything seem just right just so that the original idea is made to look & feel as real & vivid as one can possibly imagine. It almost grips your very soul and pulls you into their universe making you believe you are actually there in the moment through every scene. Now THAT's good story telling.The very title of the movie Star Trek if you realize has already had a magical effect on you & your mood that you'll probably understand even further if you are an true FAN. A trek to the stars. Sounds like an impossible journey to the average people, and yet, we too can experience this joyous sensation through this movie.You get everything, Kirk's Heroic Nature & with the ability to think on his feet and battle any situation HEAD-ON(Chris Pine), Spocks Quick Intellect & Reasoning with twisted styles of emotional, critical & Logical Thinking(Zachary Quinto), an exemplary villain Khan with inhuman strength & skill who appears to be a one man army whose wrath knows no bounds(Benedict Cumberbatch), Crazy Fight sequences with both, Man & Machine & all the High-Tech Gears, and of course, J.J.Abrams Legendary art of direction.

Abrams is a very clever director. He is no Kurusawa or Ray and he does not pretend to be so! He is the modern Spielberg and he is here to entertain and does he entertain with this sequel to an equally entertaining first star trek. With all due respect to the old star trek, the cast is spot on. Quinto redefines Spock from the time Nimoy graced and then left the scene(die Nimoy retard fans!). The pacing of the movie is superb.

I thought jj Abraham did a good job directing the first one and he didn't disappoint this time either. I never watched the old Star Trek movies or TV shows but I heard if you liked those then you might not like this one. But if you like a good action movie with an amazing story watch this one. The CGI was really good too like when the enterprise was crashing it looked realistic too. Zachary Quinn played an amazing Spock. The only complaint I had was I thought it was a little long though. You probably will disagree but I think it could of been shorter. Also in the movie Spock prime said there would be great sacrifice but I didn't really see the sacrifice part but besides that I think it was a perfect movie just like the previous one.

I've never really paid much attention to Star Trek as a series and I never even saw the 1st movie of these two, but I loved this movie, and I am pretty picky with films! (Maybe I'm biased because I'm not some oldschool trekkie, but who knows). Anyways, lots of action, a lot of edge of your seat moments, not dull at all, exciting, good acting from most. I would give it a higher score if it wasn't for Chris Pine whom I CANNOT stand as an actor. I don't know what it is about him but I just cannot take his acting seriously, and his acting is just meh, not something I would remember, competent at best. I don't know, he just didn't seem very Captain Kirk, maybe if they made a Star Trek tween movie I would understand, but this...not so much, I imagined someone a bit older and more mature to play his role. (Its like having Russel Crowe play Spock or something crazy, it just does not go!) NEVERTHELESS! I loved the film and didn't leave feeling disappointed, and Zachary Quinto's acting (Spock) was AMAZING like usual.

The screenplay was brilliant with the right amount of intensity, humour, emotion and action.The way they've moved forward with the new timeline was very well done allowing past stories to cross paths with the enterprise but in a completely new light. All the actors did there characters justice with Cumberbatch making an amazing villain. I'm not a huge fan of 3D but the film worked extremely well in 3D.

858,slimmcnally,Lens Flare: The Movie!!!,5,27 September 2013,"Well let's get straight to the point. The actors from the first one return and I have to admit that it is well casted (minus Chris Pine who is a terrible choice for the great role that could have gone to a more deserving actor). The other members of the crew are perfect in their roles. The villain played by Benedict Cumberbatch is very convincing and does not disappoint. All the actors bar one are the right choices for their roles. The problem with this film lies in story and execution.This is a very weak script. The story is predictable, the dialogue is very stock (and when I mean very stock I mean a rip off of Star Trek II: The Wrath of Kahn, once you watch both of them you will understand what I mean) and I can't help but feel this was rushed together. I will say that I did like the opening sequence and the scenes that followed it because it asked some real philosophical questions about responsibility of human life , but other than that I felt it was poorly written.Which leaves the direction. J.J. Abrams is yet to amaze me. All of the films he has directed have been decent but none of them have wowed me. For someone that is supposed to be this creative genius she hasn't shown it. He hasn't really done any bad work until now. This film is carried by its actors and not by its direction. The film should have been called Lens Flare: The Movie because it is full of them. I can understand using them when you are trying to establish mood or trying to go for a distinct style but this is way over the top. They are all over the place. Real dramatic scenes are ruined by them. People have said that he likes to use lens flare in his other films and I have to admit I did not notice or at least they did not intrude upon it, but he has gone to town on this and shoved them anywhere regardless of meaning or placement. There are at least a couple of scenes where if the film was really happening then the lens flares should not appear because the wouldn't have been a light source for them to exist. I would have given this film a solid 8 (mainly because of the acting) but thanks to Flare Abrams I can only in good conscience give it a 5.I only hope he doesn't send Star Wars into a deeper pit than George Lucas did.",Star Trek Into Darkness

The plot was from the Wrath of Khan from back in the 80's. I really like Benedict Cumberbatch as Sherlock, but as Khan he misses the mark. Ricardo Montalban was the perfect Khan. Smart, good looking, good strong body, and menacing. Cumberbatch did not fit that role. I can think of any number of male actors that could have fit the role better. Khan was supposed to be a superman, not a tall skinny guy. Chris Pine did a good job in his role. So did Zachary Quinto. I was disappointed as well (spoiler alert) of the Spock calling Spock scene. Every time the Enterprise runs into a bad guy is Spock going to call Spock? And again (spoiler alert) the scene of the radiation death is just a copy of the Wrath of Khan death scene. It was hard to get choked up about the death scene, when you knew it was not permanent. It was a predictable shadow of a copy of the Wrath of Khan.

Tastes great while you're eating it, but short on nourishment. They did it well enough that this junk food has squeezed pretty much everything good off the menu. The picture is just mediocre, but the trends it started have been horrid. Cornball plotting and dialog is one thing, but the simple-minded good vs. evil masquerading as some sort of authentic spirituality is vomit inducing.

862,cyber___,A highly entertaining Star Trek blockbuster with an ending that will possibly ruin the experience for certain viewers,8,13 June 2013,"The main focus of the Star Trek: The Original Series was always exploration. But it's strength laid in the crew of the Starship U.S.S. Enterprise crew and their interaction with each other, Kirk and Spock in particular. Outside of the short introduction sequence, Into Darkness has nothing to do with exploration, but the crew is as interesting and entertaining ever, staying true to the core of each character despite being remakes in an alternate reality. The story does come with clever and interesting twists and turns. The script itself is very well written - especially the dialog, delivering several memorable quotes, polished and entertaining exposition, and individual speech types for each of the characters, which is rarer than one might think. But it's not just the dialog and story that brings us such entertaining and likable characters. The acting is solid throughout the entire film. Not one actor does a bad job here. But there is one who stands out – Benedict Cumberbatch as John Harrison! He gives us, despite hamming it up here and there, a very memorable performance. John Harrison is meticulously cunning, ruthless, and is a physical force to be reckoned with – and yet, impressively, we still feel for him.Another thing about Into Darkness which impress is the visuals. And not just with the CGI, but with beautiful cinematography and mise-en-scène as well, and the warp aesthetics, and how well they utilize the scenery.Of course, no movie is without fault, and this one is certainly no exception. In fact, there is one aspect which will possibly ruin nearly the entire experience for some; the ending is quite stupid, which there's no denying, and it goes too far with trying to tie in with the old Star Trek that it comes off as plain lazy.While this is overall a very well made movie, I expect the final rating from the audience will vary greatly from individual to individual because of the ending.

The writers think they are so 'clever' by just taking an already hit script and just reversing a few things to pass it off as a new film? For the hundreds of millions spent, can't we get SOMETHING NEW? Must we re live the same movie OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN? Are these films or just cheap amusement park rides disguised as film? Kirk dies, instead of Spock, Spock yells ""Khan!"" instead of Kirk. Kirk comes back to life instead of Spock in a dreadful meaningless film? Star Trek has the ENTIRE universe with a crew of amazing special effects masters and all they can come up with is.... let's RE DO KHAN?? and do it badly.I didn't even care for the wasted use of Klingons..... dozens all killed by one man? Sure, Khan is super human, but he is using a gun to kill them all, and what, Klingons don't have guns?? Who put the clitoral rings in the Klingon's heads??More importantly, they are rushing the friendship between Kirk and Spock. Already Spock is weeping like a little girl for his dead friend? They've only known each other for a very short time?? No bonding?? No history first? And enough already with Spock and Uhura. IT DOESN'T WORK. He's a #^%&) Vulcan!! That relationship is ruining the whole point of the character of Spock.I enjoyed the first film and thought it was great. This one is just masturbation. Nothing new, no NEW eye candy. No wild and new worlds to encounter... just a blue eyed white boy, Khan, with a ""Bain"" voice from Batman. Hello.... Darth Vader has the voice.... now every movie has to have a villain with a dark scratchy audio enhanced voice? And what in the HELL is Khan's purpose?? Sure the Admiral needed info from him to achieve knowledge, but what was Khan's motif for being so evil? No motif, nothing. The filmmakers are relying on the fact that everybody knows who Khan is.Star Trek SLIPS Into Darkness, is entertaining, and keeps you watching, but when it's done, you walk out with nothing new to think about. No new story, just the same old crap....and Lt. Uhura is NOT a super hero..!!! She's the communications officer!! Why in the hell they beam'd her onto the moving roof top of that ship to help Spock is beyond violating continuity. The series is becoming a Super Hero rip off and moving away from what Star Trek is supposed to be. It's supposed to tickle your brain and your eyes, not just shake the camera at the lights and re do the same old story, badly.If those ***holes ruin the new Star Wars coming out, like they are ruining Star Trek, then the end of good science fiction will soon be complete. Science fiction hits will only be for 15 year old kids that have no idea good science fiction film used to have a STORY and wasn't just explosions and alien make up.I gave it a 5 for special effects only. No, and not for Kirk and McCoy jumping off that cliff. We've seen that lame cliff jump in so many films now...they even had the balls to use the same jump twice??

That being said, I simply have to bow down and give huge credit to Benedict Cumberbatch for his amazing portrayal of Riccardo Montalban's legendary Kahn character from both the OGS and Wrath of Kahn. I can guarantee you - Montalban would have gotten the chills if he had lived to see Cumberbatch's portrayal of his own character - just pure perfection in regards to acting and he stayed true to Montalban delicate and calm portrayal of Kahn.

So much that if Gene was alive today, it would have killed him.In fact I'm calling out anyone attached to this movie as to really being a Trek fan. Star Trek isn't suppose to be about Halo firefights, starting wars, and building warships. It's suppose to be how we as humans came together as technology on earth advanced. Then traveled the stars sharing our wisdom to civilizations who were just like we once were.If anything this movie is a reflection on today's society and it's sickens me. When the original TV showed aired it was during troubled times ( I'm only 37, but I learned all about that stuff from The Wonder Years). People 30 and under had little hope for the future.Wars, Cold Wars, Nukes, Political Corruption-- No one at that time thought we as the human race would live to see the year 2000. Then came Star Trek. It showed a future where mankind put its differences aside. We worked together for a common goal. We seek knowledge through exploration and looking back at our own history. And not only that, but we were the conscience that helped others see the wrongs they were committing. Star Trek gave young people hope.THEN THERE'S THIS MOVIEExplosions, Loud music, Gun Fights, Fist fights, head squashing, jumping, running, explosions, explosions, explosions. Did I mention Explosions?!! I'm not sure because this movie probably had more explosions than TOS and TNG combined.This is an insult to what Trek once was. It pisses on what Star Trek 2 was really about-- The man who never faced death, but stared it in the face-- Only in this one he dies and is brought back to life without a sequel. It crapped all over Kahn as well, who was in essence a remnant of who the human race was in the late 20th century. NOT A FREAKING SUPER SOLDIER WHO JUST MURDER-DEATH-KILLED FOR NO REASON.AND ABOUT THAT PLOT.Kahn was a one man army in this movie-- So one would think if he defrosted his people, all 72 of them, they'd be unstoppable-- Instead he puts them in Torpedoes to ruin Robocops plan of starting a war with the Klingons to defrost them later...WHAT THE AM I TALKING ABOUT I DUNNO BUT THAT WAS THE PLOT!!This movie is for morons who couldn't get into the original Star Trek because they probably see it as old, boring, and full of bad actors. Let's not forget the pride of TOS was the fact all 80 episodes were well written.Something Into Darkness isn't. This isn't even good fan-fiction. This is an embarrassment. It cost millions to make, it will make over billion at the box office.Like I said, this is more of a reflection on our society in general and it disturbs me that Star Trek as turned into a mindless 2 hr romp and not a beacon of hope for the future of mankind like the original series did.The only HOPE these JJ Treks bring is the Star Wars movies he'll make will be just as mindless, which fits perfectly for Star Wars, not for Star Trek.",Star Trek Into Darkness
869,orlandotourist8462,Star Trek Into Darkness is the confirmation for Star Wars Episode VII's faith,9,18 May 2013,"For the first time in science fiction history, the faith of the next Star Wars movie has to depend on this new Star Trek. So is it good? Let's find out.Now that he's Captain of the Enterprise, James T. Kirk (Chris Pine) and his crew request to go after a Star Fleet fugitive by the name of John Harrison (Benedict Cumberbatch), after he attacked two key Star Fleet locations. Kirk, Mr. Spock (Zachary Quinto), and the rest of the crew embark on an adventure that leads to some surprises and unexpected events.There was a lot of excitement for this movie, and the trailers made it appear that no one was going to be safe, and given the fact that this is an alternate reality, anything can happen. While it's not as good as the last movie, it does have some improvements. The action scenes are much better and more exciting. So exciting that they made me feel tense most of the time. Since the crew is established with each other, there's better interaction between the characters and Kirk is a much better fighter then in the last movie. The villain is a lot stronger in this movie then Nero was in the last one. Benedict Cumberbatch owns every scene he's in and is great as John Harrison. I also love how Scotty (Simon Pegg) is given more to do since he wasn't introduced until at the end of the second act of the last movie.There was some stuff that I wasn't crazy about. One thing that disappointed me was that the trailers made me feel a sense of dread, and I didn't feel that until near the end of the film. The rest wasn't all that dreadful. I felt that the ending was somewhat of a cop out. It's not really bad, it's just not as climactic as the ending of the last movie. It felt a bit rushed. One thing that I feel is going to irritate hard core Trekkies, is the fact that the beginning of the third act, feels like they were remaking bits of ""Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan"". I've seen that movie, and as a very casual Star Trek fan, it didn't bother me all that much, with the exception of one moment in particular that took me out of the movie for a while. People who have seen the movie will know what I'm taking aboutDespite that one moment, it wasn't enough to ruin what is an very enjoyable movie. It wasn't as good as the 2009 version and it wasn't as emotionally powerful as I was hoping it to be, but it's still pretty good and if you can, see it in IMAX, because there are scenes that were made for the IMAX format.",Star Trek Into Darkness

I certainly can't imagine the next one without the same star cast and more importantly without Mr.Abrams ......who is the soul to this entire journey .

871,monkriffe,Star Trek Into Darkness Review- some very mild spoilers,8,12 May 2013,"STID (not quite as contagious as it sounds) has often thus far been reviewed in comparison to its predecessor, the admittedly brilliant Star Trek of 2009. This is frequently seen as a trap, so I'm going to try, initially at least to review the movie on its own merits. Here goes.Into darkness opens with a Star Trek equivalent of a Bond movie opening sequence on the beautiful planet Nbiru, grabbing the viewer by the eyeballs as we're forced into watching two separate blistering action sequences involving deep sea diving, an erupting volcano and raiders style alien natives with spears in a crimson forest. It's stunningly beautiful, and the most colourful the film gets for the rest of its considerable running time. It also sets an integral theme for the rest of the movie: Despite the slightly nonsensical plot- quite what Kirk and McCoy were doing in the temple in the first place is never explained- there's enough action and beautiful shots to make you try and forget the need for a plot in the first place. This seems to fade into the background with the start of the movie proper- Abram's' ultra modern London, and the wonderfully tragic background story to an explosive break in at a London Starfleet Archive feel almost like another movie. Kirk's comical side is slightly muted in the face of office politics and an FBI- style briefing on Cumberbatch's character- still at this point in the shadows- until Harrison starts coming out into the open and blowing things up, whilst glaring malevolently the whole time. It's once John Harrison comes onto the stage that the film starts taking off- limited only by the fact that he isn't in it enough. You find yourself rooting for him, more than the Enterprise's crew, who for the most part, with the exception of Kirk and Spock, fade into the background.Kirk's swift off the books chase of Harrison into deep space is fun enough; although increasingly murky due to plot details too spoilerific to go into here. But again, despite the welcome reappearance of familiar enemies on the starboard bow, it's only with Cumberbatch that the film becomes really engaging. His character is constantly evolving, from Sherlock- esque mind games to unfettered brutality in his fight scenes. You find yourself constantly guessing as to which side he's on- but when you ultimately do, well decide for yourselves.In comparison to its precursor, Into Darkness doesn't pull off the slick ride of Star Trek. Neither in story cohesiveness, nor in terms of originality. To its credit, the action scenes are up to the standards of its predecessor, and sufficiently engaging to dispel any growing pedantry over the plot. In fact, it's only really in terms of the story of the film that it falls down. Not in terms of the dialogue, which remains snappy as ever, especially with Scotty, whose depiction by Simon Pegg gets the chance to actually become a serious and integral character, as well as very, very funny. But the plot seems to mutate over the course of the film from an original and engaging adventure to merely a very good remake of a story which was already pretty good to begin with. It's not the execution that bothers me, although one plot line involving a radiation chamber and a tribble could have been done better, but rather that one of the high selling points of Star Trek in 2009 was the promise of originality. The genius of rebooting the franchise in its entirety gave the promise of new, original material. The promise of discovering new worlds and civilisations finally meant something. This makes Into Darkness' decision to turn its climax into a new and perhaps unnecessary twist of a classic Star Trek story ever so slightly disappointing.Verdict: If the above rant hasn't put you off, it's definitely worth a look. There are too many plot twists, some better than others for me to go into too much detail here, so it's worth seeing the film for yourself and forming your own opinion. There's a lot of good stuff here, and the film manages to make even a darkly lit hangar look beautiful. It's just Abrams' decision to try and pay homage to a bygone age which has not quite worked as smoothly as last time round. As the title suggests, the Star Trek franchise is flying into slightly murky territory, but it's still one hell of a ride.",Star Trek Into Darkness
872,jasonparkeres3,Best Movie Ever,10,17 May 2013,"I'm not a Trekkie. I've tried to watch the original movies and they are slow and boring to me. The only reason why I tried to watch them and like them was because I loved the '09 reboot.The '09 reboot was my favorite movie of all time. Into the Darkness is just as good.If you're an old school Star Trek fan, then I have no idea whether you'll like this or not. But if you liked the '09 reboot, then you should love this.It's a fast paced action movie in space, but very much an inward emotional journey at the same time. I think that's why I like the new Star Trek much more than the old--it's faster paced and has more heart, less head.",Star Trek Into Darkness
873,Americancarver,This movie is awesome,10,18 May 2013,"This movie is even better than the first NEW Star Trek! The cg is awesome and the story is great. I truly enjoined it. The use of swearing was greatly reduced from what the first one was, a very welcomed change as I would not allow my 7 & 8 year old to see the first one but would consider the second though it is rated pg-13. This movie will defiantly keep you on the edge of your seat most of the time. Although some of the plot becomes very obvious as the movie goes on. For those of you that have seen old trek movies some of the plot will be very familiar, but with a big twist. I hope they keep up on this series and if they continue with what they are doing the. The next on will be even better than this one, although it will be difficult to top this one but not impossible as the very ending is very predictable. What you expect to happen will. It would be nice to see some of the twists to take you in an unexpected direction. But that is my only negative thing I have to say about it. Great fun and defiantly an addition to my collection when it releases on disk.",Star Trek Into Darkness
874,kenkennyrh,Gene Roddenberry would be proud . . . .wow !!!,10,21 May 2013,"Let's get this out of the way right off the bat. This is the best film I've seen in 10 years and, yes, I am a Star Trek fan. Does that necessarily make me biased ?? Well . . .no, because this is most definitely Star Trek Mark 2 for those who've never seen an episode of any of the series or one of the other 10 films prior to J.J. Abrams re-working from 4 years ago.There is a major difference between the Cinema experience and Home Entertainment so if you're waiting for this to come out on BluRay . . .don't. Get out to see it in all its' cinematic glory.Damien Lindelof did a lot right with his script for Into Darkness. Bringing back Khan as the villain was an inspired choice given that this character was central in one of the most beloved episodes of the original Star Trek TV series and again in, arguably, one of the best movies involving the original crew. I had reservations about Benedict Cumberbatch before seeing this but his performance as ""John Harrison""/Khan is permeated with quiet yet forceful menace.The Spock/Kirk relationship is pitched just right here too after the fraught antagonism of the first Abrams movie. Not sure about the smoochy stuff between Spock and Uhura, though.I was led to believe that the action in this film was even more energetic and fast-paced than the last and I wasn't disappointed on that score either. And, of course, the brief inclusion of some Klingons was very welcome also.The two hours and a bit screening time just zipped by in the cinema and, quite honestly, I could have managed another hour. Even the end credits are watchable.So without going on at length this is, in my humble opinion, the perfect cinema night or day out. It has drama, pathos, loads of action with a credible villain delivered in beautiful tones and backgrounds with solid performances from all the cast.What more could you want ???",Star Trek Into Darkness
875,ourcatch22-690-400278,Good Not Great,6,20 May 2013,"Star Trek is a good movie but not a great one. I am not a big fan of Star Trek to be honest and even thought the TV shows were boring, except Enterprise which I thought was pretty good. Most Star Trek fans hate Enterprise though so that should tell you if you're a fan of the original and next generation series you and I probably won't agree anyway. I thought the 2009 Star Trek film was pretty good and this was at least as good. Great action and adventure. After Capt. Kirk and the crew of the Enterprise find an unstoppable one man weapon of universal destruction from within their own star fleet, Captain Kirk leads a manhunt to a war-zone world to capture him before it's too late.

I will admit, storyline is poor, but the film makes you forget about it and you enjoy it. It has a good amount of action and dialogue and it's even and nicely balanced. All I have to say is Cudos to Zachary Quinto. Just a perfected job as usual. Amazingly acted his character of Spock. Which isn't simple. Spock is a reserved and much serious character of the Star Trek cast. He carries it perfectly throughout and for one of the main character's to be as reserved and quite he does it perfectly and makes us love his character more and doesn't make it boring and unwanted. One emotional scene between Captain and Spock made me shead a tear and make me love them more. It made us see their friendship and their type of friendship be defined. Too good, too good. Anyway, it's REALLY good. WORTH SEEING.",Star Trek Into Darkness
878,Nixter32,One of my favorites (must see movie).,7,10 July 2013,"I seriously enjoyed this movie through and through. As a major Star Trek fan I have seen just about every Star Trek movie and TV series made, with the exception of Deep Space Nine, (and maybe one or two others that slipped through the cracks).I was absolutely impressed with technology and awesome interior displayed on the ship. The cities and landscaping that the CGI helped to create was fascinating. I wish all the Star Trek pictures had the ability to use this CGI technology.To me, with the money, technology, CGI, and brainpower they put into this movie, this has got to be the best Star Trek movie ever made!Aside from the absence of all the original cast members (William Shatner, etc) The new generation of actors (not to be confused with the NYG TV series) did a fantastic job continuing the on with the saga of Star Trek.On the downside, there were a couple things changed in the abilities of the characters. These abilities don't really match with the other movies and their plots. So if you keep an open mind, these new changes are good enough to make the movie an absolutely awesome movie. Just ignore those minor changes OK?This is a MUST SEE FILM FOR 2013",Star Trek Into Darkness
879,davidwcash,Another great Star Trek,9,17 July 2013,"Bring a long time Star Trek fan, I'm very pleased to see this kind of reboot for the franchise. This movie, Star Trek into Darkness, ranks as one of the best. The main thing I love about this movie is the story. The story line about Star Fleet and their need for Khan display a dichotomy of Star Fleet that parallels the early movies in the franchise that links it back to the Undiscovered Country and the original movie with Khan. It also explores what hatred does to a man showing that Marcus has ill regard for his daughter and is only concerned for is own personal goals. Watching Kirk and Spock's characters to continue to develop is also another great part of this movie. Assuming their roles and putting slight twist that still resonate the earlier movies. With a story like this, it makes a movie easy to watch over and over so you can always find things that helps relate other parts of the movies together. The one thing I didn't like was USS Vengeance was a bit over the top, little bit too big and powerful. I get the point, but a bit over board.Over all, I could go on forever here, but great movie. Can't wait for the next one. Someone please slap some since in JJ and get him back over here to complete this series!",Star Trek Into Darkness

The not quite so good news is that the plot is minimal and pretty predictable, and the acting (and / or casting), with the exception on Benedict Cumberbatch as Khan, is abysmal - half the time I was wondering if I was watching a spoof! Scottie, Bones and Chekov were particularly awful. I am not a big Star Trek fan but had enjoyed the original Star Trek movie because of its terrific storyline, but I did not particularly enjoy this. The movie's rating at the time of writing is 8.3 so I am obviously in a minority. Die Hard fans will love it but I wonder how true Trekkies would feel.

I mean really what is wrong with this character why is he getting all mushy with Uhura why is he shedding tears when the captain takes a dirt nap. Why is he feeling stuff. The old Spock ....well he was awesome he never broke character. He looked like a Vulcan...Acts like a Vulcan...And doesn't feel like a Vulcan...Isn't the dominant side (The Vulcan side) supposed to suppress the human side.

This movie was absolutely enthralling and was just as good as JJ Abrams' last one. (I believe Abrams has produced the best of all Star Trek movies.) Do yourself a favor and go see this in IMAX 3D, and you won't be disappointed. You've never seen space like this before! This movie ties into the other ST movies just beautifully, in ways that completely impressed me. It is great to see the origin of the friendship between Kirk and Spock. Before seeing this movie, I read a less-than-stellar review by Anthony Quinn of the UK's Independent, which had me a little worried. Could genius Abrams actually flop? I could not disagree more with his review. His criticism was that it was too much to have two intellectuals on screen, Spock and Kahn, but this was not a problem whatsoever, and it certainly was never a problem in the ST: Wrath of Kahn.

Don't tell me they don't have stuff beyond logic.My point: Let a movie entertain me. Into darkness does exactly that.

I sit at home when the DVD/Bluray comes out to watch it in awe of my own home theater and make my undivided review, so here it is; I thought the movie, if it was a first, would be great. The first problem arose when Pike was killed, meaning that history was rewritten to include him in a death that was done many years in Kirks past. Then the introduction of Khan, which was also done in Kirks past. Also the movies radiation episode was also told in Kirk's past but with Spock as the hero and dying.

This is a rebooted franchise so by definition there has to be similarities with differences or else it would just be the same movie redone. Yes, Khan is a ruthless super villain as he was in the previous versions. But, yes Kirk still requests his help after he kills federation leaders. Why is that so hard to believe? At that moment in the story Kirk felt he had no other choice in order to save his crew from obliteration. ""What would you do for your family?""Yes, Spock struggles with his emotions and shows rage and anguish, he has ALWAYS had an inner struggle with his human side, hence the depth to his Vulcan character. Yes, the dialog/plot line of the warp core breach and the 2 main characters' involvement are practically verbatim with Star Trek II: Wrath of Khan, except with the roles reversed. The entire Star Trek ""family"" is now on it's own time-line so events could be similar to the past, but obviously could also be different because, after all, did two Spocks exist in the past Star Trek films/series? Both Spock and Kirk in this film at that moment even state that had the roles been reversed that's what each of them would have done: obviously because that exactly what was done in the first time-line!Some people had issues with the easy infiltration of the military starship. Well, that ship was being built in secret by the top military leader, there was no enemy around, no need to heighten security. BUT they should have still communicated with an unknown vessel entering the construction site, so yes perhaps the infiltration was too easy.Some people questioned how can people communicate from such large distances (galaxies) but yet not be able to transport between ships/places within the same planetary system. It's harder to get transporter locks on moving targets especially if you want to keep a human being in tact, wouldn't you say?All in all, this was an entertaining adventure ride. The iconic characters's relationships are still growing in this movie towards what Trekkies know and love them to be in the Shatner/Nimoy days. Will there be a battle with the Klingons? That is to be expected because Klingons verses Federation is such a strong element is the previous storyline. Trekkies will enjoy the film even more if they realize that this is not a retelling of old tales, this is a tribute to them while still creating new ones.

Villain agrees to cooperate just because of ""72 reasons"" hidden on a ship. As in all movies, antagonist appears when protagonist needs him most - Captain learns how accountable he is for and to his own team thus, sacrifices himself. In his final moment, he sees the point Spock tried to make in prequel - face fear of imminent death yet be commander a Captain should be. Kirk asks First Officer how to shut down emotions and, surprisingly, Spock has no idea how to. They finally admit their friendship and captain dies in front of Vulcan's eyes. Spock acts upon his emotions second time and, again, it is Kirk who unleashes his rage. As alternative Spock has mentioned, their friendship affects them both - Kirk's recklessness balances Spock's unshakable logic.

Born & raised in a very pragmatic country that praises the powerful and despises the ""weak"", I was always attracted by the ST/SW culture but have never actually watched one of the movies. One of my favorite actors is Benedict, and when I was watching one of his interviews he said that he likes the movie in that he likes the script's ""Shakespearean"" treat to each of the characters, which extends to JJ's Shakespearean treat to the cast as well and makes him feel safe/secure to play such an important role in such a culturally phenomenal movie. Those words moved me and I immediately decide that I need to watch this film. From my point of view, the ST world is just amazing. The diversity of the species, the moral standards and friendship, most importantly the ADVENTURES. I really like the last bit when it says the final frontier.

I've followed all the ST movies (we have them all) and have watched all the series.I loved the 2009 film and just rewatched it the other night for the umpteenth with my 15 year old son to introduce him to the ST world. He came with us tonight as did hubby and our 19 year old daughter. That being said, this film kept me on the edge of my seat. OK - so I guessed a lot of the plot, but that's because I know ST and love it. Even so, this film was better than the first with a more realistic villain. Love the interplay of the characters in this alternate reality and their ability to bring in bits and pieces from the various series and movies.Son and daughter both loved it as well. Of all the franchises out there, this remains my favorite and JJ Abrams has only given it new life and energy and I thank him for that.",Star Trek Into Darkness

He is great in the role of the villain and gives his character incredible depth and realism.The relationship between the Enterprise crew, and especially the on between Kirk and Spock, is explored on a higher level.

895,jcterzak-28759,Letdown,5,17 August 2019,"I'm going to try to avoid direct spoilers.After the Reboot breathed new life into the series and you have a young talented cast this movie proceeded to disappoint in a number of ways. And this is all on the story and plot.1. Why attempt a remake of one of the better (if not the best) original cast movies. This particular villain had a backstory set up in the TV series. I also feel that this character raises fan expectation especially when you have such a talented actor in the role.2. This plot felt rushed, Why not write a multi-movie plot for Cumberbatch (maybe a trilogy) to allow for the story and character to develop with the new cast. In fact you can use some of the very same twists from the original cast plot they used in this movie over multiple movies and make a solid story.3. As much as I loved seeing Nimoy in the small scene, the token fan service scene just reminded me mid-movie of the original cast version4. The Klingon section made little sense, I understand the costume and appearance changes to a point but to have them so under-powered?5. The reboot series has seen too much of Earth, you have an entire galaxy to explore, let's see it!Overall: this movie was a bit of a conundrum to me, I feel like the cast and crew nailed the execution of the story and the movie was a fun ride.

I am a big Star Trek fan and The Wrath of Khan is one of those movies that you can watch over and over again, it will always be to me the pinnacle of the Star Trek franchise. To me, Wrath of Khan is what Empire is to the Star Wars franchise (ironically J.J. will be doing that to). But what I can say is that what J.J. Abrams has done is not a reboot, re-imagining, remake, retelling, or whatever name Hollywood uses to put out there latest piece of garbage. What he has done is made pure sequels, it is a telling of what would happen if after Star Trek VI, Spock went back and changed history. Thats what people don't realize.

It's the McRib of Star Trek films.I prefer the Bond franchise where attempts to introduce clever technology and emotional attachment to the characters in the Daniel Craig reboot (specifically in Casino Royale and Skyfall) has resulted in a far higher quality product. And that's what Star Trek: Into Darkness is... it is product. It feels like the Frankenberry cereal to just about ever other franchise sequels wholesome, a** kicking bowl of Vector.See it but don't come running to me when you get "" the diabetus""- I warned you it was junk food.",Star Trek Into Darkness
899,christhegr,Kahn will steal your heart and then destroy it.,8,17 April 2020,"There is no light without the Darkness. In the history of cinema big baddies have stolen the screen and made a good movie great. In recent memory the list of villains audiences loved to hate include the likes of Thanos (Josh Brolin), the Joker (Heath Ledger and Joaquin Phoenix...in that order), Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes), and Willam Cutting (Daniel Day Lewis) just to name a few. These actors painted their cinematic canvases with shades of grey nuanced evils so masterfully it asked the viewer to explore the bad places they would never go in the back of their own minds. So what is it that make these villains so beautifully bad? It is a combination of their power and might but also their humanness, which is to say that we can relate to them even if we don't want to admit it. They shine brighter than their counterparts on screen and no matter how great the other actors in the movie may perform, the own and make the movie. All of that being said Benedict Cumberbatch's Kahn checks all the boxes to easily join the ranks of recent and all time cinemas greatest baddies. The movie itself is not a masterpiece, but the familiar recurring characters like Spock (Zachary Quinto), and Captain Kirk (Chris Pine), bring a wonderful combination of heroism, conflict, comedy, and likability to the movie. However Kahn is the heart of this movie. His undeniable power makes him a more than worthy adversary for the crew of the Enterprise. Like Thanos and many of our other favorite bad guys, Kahn's display of might and cunning is scary to the point that we question how the hell can anyone defeat them. Kahn is an immovable dark force capable of extinguishing our belief that our beloved Enterprise heroes are good enough. A lot of people will overlook the performance of Benedict Cumberbatch in this movie...and many people have never seen this movie or will never see this movie. In this case many people will see my comparison of Kahn to the most notable villains in cinematic history as ludicrous at the least. But I argue that he belongs in the same class as any of these baddies, as within his universe their are no equals. Whether you love or hate him, Kahn jumps off the screen and taps in to all of our fears and captures or attention from start to finish. This movie is underrated and under appreciated in itself and those who miss it will be missing a huge link in the chain of unforgettable characters of recent cinema.",Star Trek Into Darkness
900,Phanatic77,Star Trek: Into Darkness,9,29 May 2013,"Trekkies and mainstream audience galore rejoice as JJ Abrams returns to direct his latest installment, Star Trek: Into Darkness – A name befitting the film exceedingly well. The Plot - The movie picks up a year after the events portrayed in the previous installment. James T. Kirk is in command of the Enterprise, and the audience is treated to a visceral introductive piece that sets the pace for the rest of the film. While in the previous installment, the crew fought a Romulan bent on revenge that ultimately alters reality, this time around Kirk and his crew have their hands full as they are pinned against an academy officer who, for reasons unknown, swears a vendetta against the entire federation and executes his devious plans by deploying heinous terrorist acts. The Acting – While it is very unlikely that any of the cast members, Benedict Cumberbatch included, will receive any academy award nods, one would be hard pressed to argue that the acting here is not spot-on. The two leads, Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto reprise their roles as young Kirk and Spock, and they do so with great confidence and authority. Clearly no one can replace William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy, however Pine and Quinto serve great justice to the iconic characters with abundance of winks and tip of the hat moments that cater even to the hardcore fans of the original series and movies. The two play off each other really well, and there is great chemistry among the entire cast as-well. Benedict Cumberbatch who plays the villain provides a stellar, engaging, and oftentimes moving performance, and he does so effortlessly. The Action – JJ holds no punches when it comes to cinematic set pieces as he provide much of a spectacle as he does truly engaging edge of your seat explosive visceral sequences. From the moment you see the enterprise rising out of the water accompanied by the unforgettable score booming in the background, you know you are in for a treat when it comes to action and special effects. JJ knows how to work the camera, special effects, action, GCI, and he is not afraid to showcase it, even at the risk of over-indulging for the sake of over indulging. Final Verdict – Although JJ Abrams manages to hit most of the right notes here, this movie unfortunately suffers from some flaws that hold it back from being a true masterpiece, namely character exposition. The villain here, although menacing, simply does not reach his full potential as a result and ultimately feels like a rehash of a much greater villain. Further, while there is depth to the characters, the movie appears as if it is sprinting across the emotional exposition without letting it breath properly. The movie also runs a tad too short with just about two hours and ten minutes until the credits roll, and could have definitely used additional character arcs and revealing story boards, namely the villain. However these flaws do not detract heavily from what the movie has achieved. It is best to view this movie objectively for what it is as opposed to what some might believe it is supposed to be. It is not a remake, rather another chapter in JJ Abram's reboot franchise, and it works. 8.5/10",Star Trek Into Darkness

I have little knowledge of old Star Trek so everything was fresh in interesting for me. Then it began to become Deja Vu from the first Abrams Star Trek. The movie almost presents the exact same setup as the first at this point. I guess its the second act that lost me a little, as twists and turns are literally telegraphed to the viewer. Moments that are meant to be sincere are rendered pointless, when EVERYONE knows whats going to happen. Even with all the clichés I enjoyed the movie, just got bored near the end. I will watch it again but after one viewing i'll say above average movie. Very strong first half followed by weak second half.

905,burnsec,Better than the First,10,16 May 2013,"Going into the movie, as generally is the case for sequels, the expectations were not as high. We didn't see it in 3D or anything since viewing films turned to 3D in post production is frankly a waste of money, but nonetheless the visuals of the film were spectacular. As for the movie itself, I went with people who had seen the original movies, and people who had not. Everyone had seen the 2009 reboot however. It was the majority consensus that this one was better than the first in this series, aka the 2009 one.The movie was action from start to finish, yet the entire theater was laughing out loud quite frequently during this one. Much more than the first one. The movie was great for anyone. Someone who had seen all the movies and was a trekkie, someone who had just seen the 2009 movie, or someone who had never seen the franchise before, could each enjoy it. Without giving anything away, for those who had seen the original movies and for anyone who is a big trek fan, the story line has many throwbacks to the original movies, while not being to redundant or nostalgic. There is much more character development in this movie than any of the previous ones, including the 2009 reboot. Overall, I'd suggest this movie to anyone, and if you have ever liked anything Star Trek, or just plain sci-fi or action, this is a must see. JJ Abrams has a golden hand, and this will surely keep continuing as a successful franchise under his guide.",Star Trek Into Darkness

Rattling along at a quickfire pace, you find yourself being bombarded by one spectacular action set piece to the next. The tempo never drops from the breathtaking opening on a distant planet(inside a volcano), to the jaw dropping conclusion. Twists abound, with many self referential nods to the Star Trek canon. Some might complain that on any occasion they are far too conspicuous (I'm looking at you Spock) but on the whole, they are only fan service; and that is what the purpose of this film is. This is made for fans of the franchise, it has been made in the assumption that you will have seen the previous entry in the series. Like most films (although few rarely make the effort that is on display here) the aim of this film is to be an enjoyable movie going experience for the audience. An aim that Star Trek: Into Darkness succeeds in fulfilling. A 4 year mission in the making to build upon and improve on the previous entry has finally completed.",Star Trek Into Darkness

Like me having been forced to watch the series back in the l960s with my brother's; I can't for the life of me understand what was so great about the old star trek in the first place.I think J.J. Abrams is a brilliant director and really delivered a great movie with all the action that the old ""Star Trek"" lacked. Had he done it with no action like the old ones; no one, would have liked it. I loved it and really understood it. As for the old timers considered ""Trekkies"" they are the only ones who will not like it; partly because they are just ""Stuck in the 60s"". I am now a new ""Star Trek"" fan, and hope he does more sequels. Everyone out there should give this film a chance!!",Star Trek Into Darkness
908,Engenius,More of the same on the USS Enterprise,7,28 May 2013,"After J.J. Abrams' impressive 2009 reboot of Star Trek, I found myself eagerly awaiting the next installment. With a little fine tuning to the quality of the script and giving some depth to some of the main characters, Star Trek could have become a classic. The issues with the first film I thought would be addressed for the sequel, making it far superior to an already great film. Unfortunately, it all turns out to be more of the same. Star Trek Into Darkness meets most expectations while exceeding very few. Like a truly great sequel, everything feels back and in its proper place. The cast members all feel comfortable in their given roles, almost similar to watching the TV show. You know where they all belong. This is an improvement on the original, which squeezed the crew into their roles on the Enterprise much too quickly. Kirk (Chris Pine) is more tolerable in this film. His frat boy mentality, while still present, is dialed back a bit now, so it feels like a characteristic more than a personality. This opens up opportunities to add some dimension to Kirk's character. Unfortunately, the film just doesn't take that risk. He is a young (inexperienced) and reckless leader, who is often brave and selfless when it comes to his crew. His role is as safe and cliché as ever and adds nothing new to the part. This is, regretfully, how most of the characters end up filling their roles. Particularly Scotty (Simon Pegg), whose sole purpose is comedic relief. It's frustrating because as funny as he is (he actually is!), the character is nothing more than a walking one-liner waiting to happen. Most egregious however, is Carol (Alice Eve), which, upon first introduction, I thought was going to be a strong female character. This opportunity, as quickly becomes evident, is completely squandered as she is reduced to nothing more than eye candy and jokes for Kirk and Bones (Karl Urban). It would have been better, to not introduce her character at all, as she is completely unnecessary.Even the villain, Khan, played by the magnificent Benedict Cumberbatch, is a disappointment, albeit to a much lesser degree. He ends up appearing more interesting than he actually is, mainly due to Cumberbatch's acting abilities. When we are first acquainted, Khan exudes an aura of mystery and menace. I still have goosebumps from when he says, ""I am Khan!"". This feeling doesn't last however. Khan flourishes in the shadows; his ambiguity is what makes him successful. As his layers slowly strip away, his motives become weaker and in the end nothing is left but disappointment. In this sense, Khan becomes a metaphor for the entire film; the build up is fantastic, but the movie cannot resolve its many facets successfully. Exception to this is the gifted Zachary Quinto, who plays Spock. You can tell that Spock is the character that the screenwriters (Roberto Orci, Alex Kurtzman, & Damon Lindelof) enjoyed writing about the most because he is the only well-developed character in the movie. The best scenes develop out of his cracks of human emotion hidden behind his tough Vulcan exterior. These are brought out from his relationships he shares with the film's main characters: his love for Uhura (Zoe Saldana) and why he hides his emotions from her, his bromance which blossoms into a deep friendship with Kirk, and his rage with Khan. Once again, Leonard Nimoy, makes a cameo as Spock from the future, which is one of my favorite parts of the original. However here, it feels unnecessary, and I wished it was scratched. His purpose here is to give insight into Khan. The revelations he gives, should have come about naturally through the movie, instead of all at once, adding more suspense to the film.I felt that the film didn't know how to bring all its wonderful pieces together for the end. A good example of this is the relationship between Kirk and Spock. Throughout the movie, the relationship slowly evolves but it falls apart in its climax. The story ends up faltering to make room for some soap opera-esque drama. There are ways to display the friendship sentiment differently and more suitably. The film looks fantastic. One of the key perks of Abrams' first Star Trek was the look of it. Into Darkness, takes the alluring action from the first movie and amps it up. Space looks as gorgeous as ever and all the ships and equipment have a brilliant sheen to them. The action set pieces, particularly the volcano in the opener, are beautifully designed and staged. The screenplay here is also an improvement over the original. I was impressed by how much funnier this movie was than the first, which tried often and failed. On the whole, the story is a marked improvement over the first installment, even with its hiccups. And before the end, where all the various plot pieces and character relationships don't quite fall into place, the movie functions at top level. Maybe the film is called Into Darkness because it works best there.",Star Trek Into Darkness
909,RAMfilms,Interesting new details,8,19 May 2013,"On the still altered time line, this new Star Trek provides some completely new material built on top of a familiar antagonist. It is a vey clever approach that allows for much more new thinking in the coming films. That's smart. No need to re-tell old stories. They were done right (in the original series, and the original movies) the first time. What's compelling about this movie, in addition to the story, is the stunning look and feel of it. It's a beautiful film, and the characters play their parts so well. Frankly, I'm anxious to see what happens in the next installment, given the superior knowledge gained by Star Fleet as a consequence of dealing with the villain John Harrison. Oh, by the way, I loved seeing Peter Weller in the movie. And, nice to see a Dr. Who guy in it as well.",Star Trek Into Darkness

Why would the admiral need Kirk firing those missiles onto Khronos to destroy Khan's crew who was in cryogenic sleep? He could have just cremated them, why risk so much with no reason whatsoever?And how could Khan finish so many klingons with so little effort and had so much trouble with Spock? And on top of that, how could Scotty stun him (true:for a shot period) while Uhura fired countless stuns at him and got nowhere?And those above are only examples...if you look carefully you'll find tons of non star trek thinking in this movie!

911,lamsaes,"OK, but a little disappointing",6,15 June 2013,"I loved the JJ Abrams' 2009 Star Trek reboot, so I'm not one the haters of the new franchise. I though Abrams had injected a welcome new energy and scope to the ST universe. The film was fun and inventive and had me looking forward to what they were going to do next. A sequel is always a difficult matter, because you have to deal with people's expectations and those are often impossible to match. It seems to me that Into Darkness suffers from the need of giving MORE of everything that made the first installment so successful: more action, more CGI, more noises, more jokes, more emotional scenes. There's just not any time to breathe in this film. The action scenes, for instance, are just too confusing and noisy. I would have preferred a more classic and less frenzy approach to the action shooting. This is Star Trek, not Jason Bourne. I also think that Abrams tried too hard create bombastic emotional moments for the audience. Personally, I think it is too soon for that. This is only the second film of the new franchise, and, since the first one was more of a pilot, we are watching the beginning of the adventures of the Entreprise. As the film starts, the whole crew is already falling apart. Too soon for that. It's too bad, because the plot had great potential and the villain played by the great Benedict Cumberbatch is one of the best I've seen in a ST movie. When he's on screen, the film grows. Overall, Into Darkness is a decent piece of entertainment, but one that would have benefited of a tighter script, more focused on the story and the villain.

912,mayankrajput61,A Very Entertaining And Gripping Movie,9,12 May 2013,"I went to watch the movie with some expectations; I was expecting it to be good but not really great. However what I watched was a great piece of cinema. This movie scores on various fronts, be it direction, cinematography, CGI/VFX, background score, Plot. Let's start with plot first, the first half of the movie runs two parallel plots, one for the antagonist and one for the protagonist, both are done fairly well, the first half is more of a build up and hence some might find it a little slow. The twists have been placed brilliantly, especially in the second half the climax, the anti climax and then another one to top it. For a Sci Fi franchisee movie this was definitely a winner. The Direction was top notch, Spock's dialogues, Benedict was phenomenal as the antagonist, Alice Eve made her mark in the limited presence that she had in the movie, Pines was good too. Some of action scenes are excellent in direction and implementation, the gate crash scene, Spock chasing the villain, A space ship crashing in the city, and many more. What were unexpected were some really good emotional scenes in the movie, especially those involving Spock. The movie paid homage to the original star trek series at various point and used great back ground scores, though over all the scores were pretty average. This movie is tightly packed, with first half being slightly boring but the second half is a straight 10/10. Enjoy the movie, have a great weekend ",Star Trek Into Darkness
913,Ld-Trtle,A Quest for Vengeance,4,19 May 2013,"Perhaps the main theme of the movie is 'revenge'. Some thought this movie lacked a theme, but I think that was it. The parallels that exist between the hunt for the movie's 23rd-century terrorist and that for Osama bin Laden are definitely there, and so the movie, despite appearances, really has some substance to it. Whereas bin Laden was hunted own and shot without a trial, Kirk refuses to give in to anger and his desire for vengeance, and instead captures the terrorist so that he can be tried in a court of law, all while battling the militaristic ambitions of Starfleet. That's a fairly hefty political statement to make in a movie like this (which I admire), so perhaps it's no surprise that they buried it under thousands of daft explosions and an otherwise stupid and nonsensical plot.I saw an RSC production of Hamlet the night before, for roughly the same ticket price(!).

Go for coffee? Are away from their posts? Are ordered to ignore it? Or can any ship warp in by the moon and it's the great Earth blind spot? Then the Enterprise ""suddenly"" is picked up by Earths orbit and starts spiralling in. And what does Starfeet do? They couldn't pick up 2 starships by the moon, so now that they are in Earths orbit I'm thinking they maybe noticed by now. ""Should we beam them out Sir? The Starship is spiralling in out of control and we're Federation HQ and have lots of transporters"". ""Nah, let them handle their own problems, they have Kirk and Spock they will figure it out in an overly dramatic way"".Then the big dark starship flies at high speed into San Francisco and ... lands like it's going 60 kph.

OK, I understand there might be a large market in this category (kids and youths) but in any case I just don't like it. Besides this, Into Darkness is a decent movie. Not deep, but with a lot of action and thus comparable to other action movies like Iron Man, Superman, etc. OK, you got it, this is an insult for a Star Trek, but it's not my fault.All in all, the best thing about this movie is that kids acting are older than how they were in Star Trek (2009) and maybe, if producers postpone the next movie for a decade, we get to have adult actors in our beloved space franchise.PS.

918,mstoil122859,"OK film, bad science fiction",7,9 June 2013,"Star Trek Into Darkness, judging from the host of reviews at this site, is turning out to be a very controversial work. As a summer blockbuster, it was fun. The script was more intelligent than, say, Wrath of the Titans and the visuals were great. For those who grew up on the Star Trek franchise, the homages to the 8 or 9 previous movies and the first original series--were enjoyable and since we ""know"" McCoy, Scotty, Spock and company, we don't need a lot of characterization. (Actually, Zoe Saldana's portrayal of Uhura has more depth and interest than most of Nichelle Nichols' portrayal...not because Ms. Nichols is not a fine actor but because the original writers didn't give Uhura a lot of business in the 60s series). Without mentioning any spoilers, complaints that part of the last half hour is strongly influenced by the action and dialog of an earlier film are just silly; the 2013 film is supposed to depict an alternate time line where things are somewhat--but not exactly--like the original Star Trek universe. The more serious problem that keeps this from being a really good film is that Into Darkness is very bad science fiction. What made the original series successful, despite cheesy sets and occasionally preachy or inept story lines, is the same thing that created the Star Wars franchise and makes the depressing Blade Runner into a classic: their depiction of a detailed and plausible future and its attendant problems. This is where Into Darkness fails. The first half-hour depicts a future that makes sense, more or less; but then rationality is repeatedly sacrificed so that the film can move from one visually stunning cliff-hanging sequence to the next. For example, the visualization of the Enterprise's main engine workings as a cavernous vault similar to the boiler room of the Titanic helps a nice action sequence but seems like a really unlikely outcome of 23rd century technology. The result is that Into Darkness is closer in spirit to comic book blockbusters than to science fiction or, at best, is a dilithium-powered version of Rocky Jones, Space Ranger. If Mr. Abrams wants the relaunched Star Trek to provide employment during his 50s, perhaps he might consider an entirely new approach that focuses on a future that we can believe in rather than one that's basically the background to a cinematic thrill ride.",Star Trek Into Darkness
919,bloczone-925-634320,Star Trek on the move,9,24 August 2013,"First off, its depressing to read some of the many reviews about the supposed illogical and ""wrong"" things with this new franchise, didn't anyone get that its another time-line at hand..? Even old Spock is in here by a twist of fate! Well, fans of the old Star Trek will no doubt find many changes hard to swallow, but I loved Star Trek as a kid and love it just as much now. But it not the same as the old - and thats a good thing.Acting this time around were just as good as the first Star Trek reboot, although, as others have pointed out, Cumberhatch's performance almost out-shined the others. Bones were a bit in the background this time played Karl urban, but Uhura,Sulu and Scotty were more than good, building on the characters of old Star Trek. As for scientific facts, or even sticking to the old universe, we should have grown accustomed to changes from books/earlier movies by now, examples being Batman, Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter to mention a few. Its always different, and the only good measure is how the movie stands on its own feet. And in that respect this movie does that and more. Easily a classic and a keeper in my library.",Star Trek Into Darkness
920,RoseandKenatDesertRose,"Not Impressed, Disappointing.",2,12 April 2015,"Choosing one word to sum up our rating for this movie would be difficult. It was simply disappointing, cheesy, fake, and not something we were able to take seriously. The cast seemed completely wrong, especially for Kirk and Spock. Besides being out of character throughout the majority of the film, both actors just didn't seem right for their characters. The romance with Spock and Uhura seemed out of place and random. While I liked some parts of Khan's character and performance, other parts were not believable, and just ridiculous. Most of the cast was acceptable, but still could have been done better.The entire film as a whole seemed disjointed and choppy. The flow was all off, and the transitions between situations and plot twists was painful, at best. There were several areas that had mistakes worthy of the original Star Wars trilogy, which made the whole thing seem cheap and lacking the proper care or effort.For as much hype as this film had before it's release, we were expecting a whole lot more from it. This isn't a movie we'll be watching again any time soon, and is not one we would recommend to anyone, especially a fan of other Star Trek versions.",Star Trek Into Darkness

But alas, I was disappointed.I'll try to keep it short.Karl Urban as Dr. Mcoy is great. He is by far the best actor of the lot, and plays Bones to a tee. He was the only bright spot.I still find it hard to believe that someone on his first mission after the academy (one he wasn't supposed to be on anyway), could be made captain. In the series, Jim Kirk was the youngest captain in Starfleet history, but he made captain at about 35 years old after doing his time in space and working his way up the ladder. But, i suppose that's an old complaint.The shout-outs to Star Trek II are dumb and poorly acted.They have Spock showing emotion way too often and too strongly. Lastly, and most importantly, I think Benedict Cumberbatch is an excellent actor. I also think he would make a great villain, but he is no Khan Noonien Singh. Ricardo Montalban betrayal of Khan is legendary. Khan is usually listed as one of the ten best villains. Kahn has class, finesse, he'd kill you while sipping a cognac, and reading Shakespeare. That is not the Khan we got and I'm highly disappointed.In the end, the movie would've been a lot better if they started fresh. But to take on remaking Khan?!!! That's almost as bad as remaking Darth Vader. God help us, because J.J. Abrams is doing the next Star Wars film.5 Stars is being charitable.",Star Trek Into Darkness

Let's replay events from Star Trek: The Wrath of Khan, and let's flip them a bit and it'll be cool. Once again, a group of people make a choice because they could, and forgetting to ask if they should.First off, I really like this film. It's a well made, good film. It's fast paced, it has good character beats, good character interactions, and it's big. Where it goes wrong, is that it's not bold. It fails to be new, to be different. It takes, what should have been homage at most, and turns it into 'new' plot points – just flipped a bit. As a writer/director, and a Star Trek fan, I understand this must have been tantalizing for them, and it clearly felt like the right thing to do. But after a moment of pause, didn't anyone say wait, stop. Anything we do, in the vein of what we're discussing, will only be compared to Wrath of Khan, and we don't want any part of that. Did no one ask, why should we do this? What is the upside? Of course, there is no upside. If you do it badly, you lose. And if you do it well, which they did, you still lose.The 'prime directive' should have been this Homage moments aside, we need to inhabit this new universe with our own new villains, characters, stories, before we reach back into the past and rely on, in essence, a stunt-plot We're brand new, let's enjoy it.I, personally, would love to see what Nicholas Meyer would do with all the toys that J.J.

A treatise on the indignities of war like 'Errand Of Mercy? Maybe a comedy with Harry Mudd or Cyrano Jones? The fact that I loved the movie is a matter of opinion, but these people are missing one important point-the franchise that we love is popular again.

926,ericdevet,A mismatch of elements we all have seen before in older star trek pictures/series,5,17 May 2013,"While watching this picture i got the distinct feeling i had seen this one before. I mean the action is good and the Special Effects are amazing, but the story was so familiar.After hearing the villains name it all fell into place. This film is made up of parts of the stories and events of the following:1) The TOS episode Space Seed ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0708447/ ).2) The movie The Wrath of Khan ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0084726 ).3) And the 'come back from the dead' element of the movie The search for Spock ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088170 ).They altered some locations, they changed some motivations and at the end they changed the characters in the Kirk-Spock death scene (Almost a 1 to 1 copy of the original from The Wrath of Kahn)They even introduced the character of Dr. Markus for a possible love relation with Kirk in the next movie. (Dr. Markus was the mother of Kirk's son in the movie The Search for Spock)All-in-all a very disappointing movie story-wise. It looks like they could not think of something brand new. I mean, in the first movie they established that this Star Trek Universe would be in an alternate time-line. This could have been exploited to go in to a whole new direction with adventures not seen in previous movies or series, but unfortunately they had to stick to the known stories with some alterations and twists. Good for people that have never heard of Star Trek before (If they exist) but just a re-run for the real Star Trek fans.I hope the next one will be more original and not a rework of known Star Trek stories from the past.I gave it 5 out of 10 mainly for the Special Effects and the Action, but if i had to judge on the story alone, i would have given it just 2 out of 10.",Star Trek Into Darkness
927,incaustic,Brutally bad.,1,24 May 2013,"No lie, this was one of the worst movies I've seen in awhile. Thin, dull plot that's already a rehash from a prior film. Paper thin characters. Zero intellectual or emotional depth. There was nothing challenging about this story, nothing thought provoking or even intriguing. Basically, bad guy wants to blow some *beep* up and after a bunch of explosions and hand-to-hand fights and crappy one liners, he's stopped by our heroes. The end. This kind of formula occasionally produces an awesome movie or two, but those movies are usually fresh and intelligently made in some way that makes them stand out. This movie was not intelligently made, not at all. Seriously, the writing here seemed like a seventh-grader's rendition of how adults are supposed to act: the Uhura / Spock 'fight' was like a scene you'd overhear in a middle school hallway or something. It was laughable. The few moments that should have been stirring sucked because they were just straight rips from Wrath of Khan. On screen, it seemed like explosions, gunfire, and lens flare dominated probably 80% of the shots, and the effects looked like something from a B-grade Xbox game. There was so much CG ""action"" that it all ended up being pretty boring. I never felt any sense of danger. Worst of all was that constantly swelling score with the same series of notes over and over and over again. You know what I'm talking about. I mean, damn, it was cool the first couple of times, but when the 18th minor protagonist triumph was accompanied by this same bombastic progression, I was curled up in a fetal position. Please, just make it stop. Beyond all of these issues, Star Trek was never supposed to be about endless violence and effects and one liners. It seems like Abrams has turned the series into a moderately more upscale version of Transformers, and it's too bad. There was so much more that could have been done. So yeah, this movie sucked. A lot. I can't believe the rating it has on here. I'm starting to wonder if most of the voters work for the studios or if they've received lobotomies or something...",Star Trek Into Darkness

929,waxybkl,A Senseless Waste of Time and Money,1,15 June 2013,"There is nothing new or interesting in this movie despite the hype of the reboot and a thousand opportunities to move in a new direction. The writers/director and studio sadly chose to go with a sad rip off of 1982's The Wrath of Khan and one of the most successful Star Trek movies made. The actors who are good in their own rights are forced to play comic-bookish, super hero representations of the main characters. The story has more plot holes than swiss cheese. C'mon Orci & Kurtzman, the Sol system would arguably be one of the least likely places to build a super secret base if you wanted it to go unnoticed. The Enterprise is NOT a submarine (Go to hulu and download Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea or 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea if you need to discover the difference) it IS, however, a STARSHIP. Crashing a ship (ala Revenge of the Sith) with a functional warp core, why didn't it blow up the city or at best half the planet? The death scene stolen from The Wrath of Khan was cheesy the way it turned out and quite frankly hard to watch without laughing. And finally, I also find Khan's ""magic blood"" to be a hard pill to swallow. All manufactured ooo and ahh moments at best intended for a Playstation/Xbox/Wii generation with the attention span of gnats. Star Trek is about the human adventure and I saw none of that adventure here. To paraphrase the Federation President from Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home ; Save your time! Save your money!

932,aceasar23,Good but not Great,7,18 May 2013,"Flipping through the reviews I've notice either a lot of 10 out of 10 or the disappointed 2 out of 10 neither is warranted. This latest version of JJ Abrams Star Trek Universe has a lot to like for the casual and serious Star Trek fan and unfortunately a lot to dislike.I'll start with the good stuff, the cast in these two films has been phenomenal. Back in 07 or 08 I was very nervous about the casting and very happy about Abrams, now the opposite could be said. Anyway from Chris Pine to Anton Yelchin they have all managed to create their very own characters and yet still maintain the original cast's energy and essence. Truly whether you are a life long Trek fan or have just come aboard this cast I believe in the long run will be one of Abrams greatest contributions to the Trek Universe and I hope we get to see them in at least a few more films together.The look, feel and pace of this film is on par with Abrams first Trek that should come as no shock. The effects are out of this world truly a film to be seen on the big screen and if you have the means an IMAX screen is probable the only true way to enjoy all the masterful visuals that come out of this film. Abrams was also able to use low tech to produce a nice feel to the film long time fans will enjoy seeing models of the Space Shuttle, NX-01 Enterprise, and Cochrane's Phoenix. If you like a none stop action packed roller coaster films then you will enjoy this film Abrams managed to push the pace even more than his first Trek film. From the open till the end there are few moments to catch your breath and take in the story which might have been intentional.Now the bad, some might feel Abrams has created an epic film which is the case with the visuals but the story falls well short of anything epic. Unfortunately for this fan Abrams has missed a great opportunity to create something more than a stand alone film story wise on par with any basic run of the mill action film. For anybody who has watched Trek over the years their is one essential theme through out their stories or at least the good ones and that is the progression of the human condition or growth. Abrams in my view had set the stage for a grand story with his first film flipping the universe on it's head and destroying Vulcan were very grand a epic moves but in what Universe would Nimoy's Spock let that Stand! This is where Abrams has failed to understand the world of Trek these characters don't stand for mistakes and will sacrifice there lives to correct those mistakes. Nimoy's Spock had made the grandest of mistakes in the first Trek and Abrams missed the chance to the tell the story of redemption in this film. It's funny probable the best story of redemption in Star Trek came from the Wrath of Khan, Kirk underestimated Khan and it cost him dearly and he spent the next film The Search for Spock in redemption. What did Kirk say at the end of the film ""It would have cost me my soul if I hadn't tried"" Shatner's Kirk had real growth at the end of that film. So the use of Khan in this film was also a missed opportunity, Khan was catalysts for growth and change in the original characters but I have a hard time seeing what his purpose was in the this film other than being the typical villain they could have left his name as John Harrison it would have made little difference to me.In to Darkness although very entertaining has very little to do with character growth or development two staples of Trek stories. I'm glade Abrams is moving on to do Star Wars his filming and story telling style might be better suited for that franchise. I'm hopping for more of a Christopher Nolan story teller for the next Trek but I'm not holding my breath =)! Enjoy the film!!!!!",Star Trek Into Darkness

I've been a Star Trek fan my entire life, and I've watched the first reboot about 50 times, and it still hasn't gotten old...which makes this film, once so eagerly anticipated, a total disappointment. The action scenes are good, but not oh-God-is-this-the-end great. The emotional connection between the characters feels scripted, as if we're watching the attempts at recapturing the remnants of the chemistry of the first film, and only catching glimpses of it's greatness.The rest of the film is predictable. Literally - my husband had called the entire plot, ""twists"" included, within the first 20 minutes, and he's not nearly as big a Trekkie as I am. The plot is recycled, revenge is a motive as old as time, and not particularly well done here, and there is even outright recreation of scenes from previous Star Trek movies.So, I was looking forward to it - I was looking forward to the undercurrent of philosophy that has permeated the Star Trek universe as long as I've been alive - I was looking forward to seeing insurmountable situations handled with grace, and compassion, and verve - and I was looking for new iconic moments that I can add to my collection of favorite Star Trek moments of ""What would Spock do?""

I will say straight away that I really enjoyed this movie, it keeps the same pace of the first one, and it's amazing to see these characters back while feeling they never really left. The movie does have some problems but it's strengths outweigh them.The whole cast from the movie does a great job, they look like they want to be there and nobody is disappointing in this film.Benedict Cumberbatch is the villain John Harrison and I loved him in the movie. He was bad-ass, the voice really worked for that character and he is one of the strong points. I left the movie thinking his plan didn't have to be THAT complicated but neither did The Joker's, Bane's, Loki's or any other villain really these daysThe action sequences were really entertaining too, the opening scene was cool, some really good special effects and lines. You will get to see the lens flare going on which I think makes it look so clean and futuristic.The movie was marketed and it showed way too much, some of the best lines by Benedict Cumberbatch are in the trailer, that being said he was really good in this movie and brought something new to the series as I feel that the villain in the 2009 blockbuster was a bit underdeveloped.On the downside is simply the fact that Star Trek fans may not be very pleased with this film and I totally understand that. If you didn't like the first one they push the things people don't like further. If you loved the first you will still like the film for sure, but if you didn't Into Darkness won't win you over.If you liked the first you might just love this and i'll understand if you do, but some people just might not like it and i get it.8.3/10",Star Trek Into Darkness

936,avinashjagassar,"!SPOILER ALERT! Star Trek Into Darkness, an Epic in many ways.",8,16 May 2013,"Once again let me emphasize, this note may contain what some consider to be Spoilers from J.J. Abrams' Star Trek Into Darkness. I also wish to make something clear; this is opinion, my opinion, if you disagree with anything I say then do so constructively. I will simply ignore any spamming, trolling, flaming, etc. regarding my views on this movie.So as usual I will start with the Pros;1. Acting- The acting in this movie can be seen as an improvement over the reboot in 2009. Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto bring their chemistry once again and the latter actually surprised me at times. Benedict Cumberbatch played the role of Khan Noonien Singh, aka the villain, and he did so splendidly. We also get a brief bit of acting from a Klingon, played by Sean Blakemore and it was rather interesting. Overall the performance from the actors in this movie was satisfactory.2. Storyline- The plot was very believable as it had characteristics of a series of events that make up a diabolical scheme rather than an Avengers/Dark Knight Rises style convenient happenings. Also, despite being 2hrs 12 minutes long, it was noticeable as the movie practically grips you and drags you into the storyline.3. The Little Things- There were little aspects to the movie that made me remember the Star Trek of old, such as a featured Tribble and the early mention of the 5 year Deep Space mission. Such mentions reminded me that this is the Star Trek reality not just a cheap knock off (like Michael Bay's TMNT Space Alien Turtles remake is likely to be)4. Character Development- We still see the growth of characters even after they have been Enterprise Captain, First Officer and Crew for several years. For example, Spock coming to terms and explaining how Emotion affects him and Kirk learning that being Captain isn't necessarily a one man job.5. The Fights- The space battles, the gun fights and the hand to hand combat scenes were well done and did their best to avoid lens flares. Also, Spock delivers an Epic Vulcan Death Grip to Khan, it was epic indeed.6. KHAAAAAAN!- Spock says it instead of Kirk. Right after Kirk dies. Spoiler Alert!7. The Ending- A little corny but it never gets old; the classic ending monologue from James T. Kirk on the Star Trek of old.Now for the Cons;1. Character Development- Even though he has been Captain of the Star ship Enterprise for several years Kirk seems to have not learned much about being Captain which is made apparent relatively early in the movie. Kirk and Spock still have a huge gap between them in trust despite working together for some time. Not saying it is a big Con, as I know it is necessary for the movie to flow, but it seems like this movie happened immediately after the first in some ways.2. Technology- Apparently Starfleet invests all its technology in Star ships and nothing to see things coming from space. An epic battle between a Federation vessel and what appears to be the same ship, on steroids, rages within our Solar System and nobody knows about it save for those involved. There is no alert or emergency response on Earth and apparently their primary fleet is still engaged in the Laurentian System. Granted, what was left of Starfleet on Earth was in shambles as the majority of their commanding officers in the sector were killed off early, but what about Earth's military? They even mention the military in the movie, so why doesn't any ever show up?3. An Avoidable Death- So there's this door that leads to the Warp Core which acts as a barrier to the massive amounts of radiation produced there. Kirk opens this door and runs/climb/jumps to the Warp Core in order to manually realign it (by kicking it), succeeds, saves the Enterprise and dies from overexposure to Radiation and Lack of Foresight. Hold on, why aren't there any Radiation suits outside that door should anyone need to enter the Core to kick it? I mean fix it? I'm just saying, if they have disguises and unmarked ships standing by, then why not radiation suits. To add insult to injury, when Bones first sees Kirk's body in Sickbay we get a shot of protective suits in the background. They may not have been radiation suits but still; everywhere else is prepared, except for Engineering.",Star Trek Into Darkness

So, hopefully, my views would be taken as unbiased coming from a genuine movie lover and cinema goer.The movie starts off brilliantly with Chris Pine being at his best as a rebel with a good heart and bravery. He shows his deduction skills very well, ironically in a movie that has Benedict Cumberbatch (in my view the best Sherlock that has ever been played). Benedict continues his good work as an actor in this movie as well. 30 minutes into the movie and you know this is going to be one hell of a movie. But then it starts to drag a little bit. The ending seemed very predictable with a few questions that may linger on in your mind once it ends.ST has got the right mix of twists, humor, drama, emotions and of course the special effects. Its definitely a one time watch for its visuals, acting and the humour!",Star Trek Into Darkness
939,b-rocks-382-365853,Better than the first for sure!,10,16 May 2013,"When I saw the trailer for this I thought it would just be okay. My mom loves Star Trek, shes a die hard Trekkie. Im not even sure if I spelled that right but oh well. She bought sneak peek tickets to see if so she bought me one as well. Before film I was in bad mood. All I knew going into was I liked the first one and I was already upset so I hope this movie doesn't set me over the edge. When I walked out I was amazed! I thought it was absolutely stunning! The acting in this movie was amazing. Chris pines did a good job and Spock did better in this film then in the last. The bad guy in this movie was SO much better. I thought he made the story so much more interesting. I thought Eric Bana did a terrible job in the last one, so it was nice to see a better bad guy. Visual, as always it was amazing I saw it in IMAX. I thought it was spectacular but to be honest, Id rather watch it the first time just normal. I felt like the IMAX 3D was very exhausting. (keep in mind I'm 19 so imagine how my mom felt). The best thing I think compared to the last one was a lot more character development. I thought the last one really lacked a lot of developing who they were. I felt as if they were simply just introducing who they were, which is understandable since it is the first one.Now heres my thing for all the die hard star trek people. Some of you may not like it because it lacks creativity. I have seen the some star trek movies before but it personally didn't bother me or my mom. She thought it was great!All and all, This movie is very good. It is better than the first and is a good movie to go to the theaters for. Don't miss it.9/10",Star Trek Into Darkness
940,jseele,The worst Star Trek since Generations,2,18 May 2013,"Star Trek Into Darkness is one of the most flawed, stupid and shallow experiences I ever had when watching a movie. In literally every scene I asked myself ""really?"", saw a missed opportunity, or was just bored, because I didn't care about anything happening or any character in it. The dialog is cheesy, the story makes no sense and there is no chance to connect to anything. This is basically because no one has to do any decision in this movie, no one has to be really clever, no one has to really sacrifice or risk anything. Every single slightly interesting scene and every single dangerous situation is resolved by something unexpected happening or someone unexpectedly arriving at the scene as a deus ex machina. Literally. Every. Scene. This leads to a plot driven mess where everything happens just because the script says so. On top of this sits a layer of stupid phrases and forced and incoherent character development. Kirk understands responsibility, Spock learns to know friendship, Bones stands around and is cynical, Uhura knows languages. Nothing new, nothing of interest.Besides all that this movie is just a collection of special effects and poorly executed references that will not please a single Star Trek fan and will not appeal to anyone who didn't saw the old movies and therefore doesn't get the references at all.Instead of writing to much abstract stuff, I will just list some of the several things that came to my mind while watching this flick (you always know it's a bad movie if you have too much time to think about it while you're watching):SPOILER TERRITORY STARTS HERE The film starts with the Enterprise being hidden underwater so it can't be seen by the people who live on the planet. Didn't they see the ship when they landed? Wouldn't they see it if it starts anyway? Why did they not use their transporters as usual? Is the Enterprise designed to land on a planet? Why didn't they use their shuttles? This scene is just in there to show Kirk and his buddy jump from a cliff into water and to show a nice effect when the Enterprise flies out of the water.Kirk looses the command of the Enterprise. And then gets it back ten minutes later without doing anything for it.Travelling to Kronos now takes about 10 seconds. And Klingons doesn't scan the neutral zone anymore, even if they prepare for a war, so our heroes can enter Kronos airspace undetected pretty easy.The federation doesn't scan their territory either, even if traveling to Kronos just takes 10 seconds nowadays. They also build their situation rooms now with a big panorama window, so terrorists can shoot through with the cannons of their helicopters that can approach important star fleet buildings undetected. They also don't intervene when two star ships fight to death between earth and moon. Also, if someone (Scotty) just flies into their secret weapons facility at Jupiter, they just let him do that without asking what he wants there. And if this someone sneaks into their new prototype starship (painted black, because it's evil) they also just let him do this without asking stupid questions. Luckily this isn't shown on screen so the viewer isn't able to ask stupid questions about plausibility himself. It is shown on screen though how security personnel finds the intruder out of pure luck and hesitates way too long so there is a good chance of getting killed. Luckily they didn't detected Scotty talking to Kirk on his phone or detected him fiddling around the door controls.Phone calls from the neutral zone to London are possible now.When Uhura has the chance to tell Spock of her feelings, Klingons attack and interrupt her. When she has the opportunity to show her language skills in front of some dangerous Klingons, Khan attacks, rescues her and therefore interrupts her. If Kirk and Scotty are hanging from a bridge in the machine room, ready to die, Tchekov appears out of nowhere to rescue them just in the nick of time. If Kirk nearly dies in outer space, Khan suddenly reappears (disappears first for no reason so he is able to reappear) to rescue him just in the nick of time. When the evil spaceship of the evil admiral nearly destroys the Enterprise, Scotty switches off the weapons of the evil spaceship just in the nick of time.Khan's plan is so complicated and only told dialog-wise, that me and my friends couldn't explain it to ourselves after we saw the movie. Parts of that plan: after working on secret weapons for the star fleet Khan thought his best friends were dead. He did terrorist attacks because he was angry. But his friends weren't dead at all. He then put them into torpedoes he made for the star fleet to keep them safe (think about that for a moment), anticipated they would be brought to Kronos but would not be shot at him so he could recollect them and... I still don't get it.There's plenty of more stupid stuff going on in this flick. Apart from the logical problems and inconsistencies, so much potential was wasted. If you introduce Kronos and the Klingons, do something interesting with them. If you have an interesting antagonist such as Khan, let him scheme a good plan and be clever. Don't build up a showdown where he just has to fight against Spock and is shot down by Uhura with twenty phaser shots. Spock and Khan are two physical characters in a way, yes, but they are also logical thinking ones that could outwit each others. It would have been far more interesting.The list goes on and on...1 star for the effects, 1 for the good score. It's not more than that.You better watch ""Wrath of Khan"".",Star Trek Into Darkness

942,Loly_liker,This movie was the best I had seen all year,9,7 June 2013,"This movie was truly amazing. It was better than the last one, definitely. What I loved best about it was the HUGE twist it had. Usually, when the producers of a movie preview a trailer, worldwide, they tend to give away the whole plot of the movie. But when I first saw the trailer of this movie, I was left with a mystery to what they have done to Khan, and when I found out, I was absolutely mind blown. Now, I would recommend that you don't listen to the reviewers that have said things such as 'don't watch it because of the graphics,' 'don't watch it because of the lack of the creativeness of the plot,' and 'don't watch it because of the lack of sci-fi it has.' I respect all of those opinions but they are pretty false. The movie has outstanding effects and an outstanding story plot. And seriously, how is this movie lack sci-fi? That's the biggest bull I've ever heard in my life. I give this a rate of 9/10 and a 10/10 would recommend you'd watch. But if you consider watching it, please watch the first one so you could have a better understanding.",Star Trek Into Darkness
943,andygeerlings-473-359894,"Plot holes, plot holes, and even more plot holes galore. Awfully unintelligent.",1,11 June 2013,"I'm truly ridiculed by the high ratings this movie got. An 8.2??? It clearly pays to air absolute ridiculous dribble with a whole lot of even more ridiculous 100%-non-stop-action in it, and the masses just love it. I'm no Trekkie and I actually enjoyed the previous movie, but this one feeds you utter and complete crap and just requires you to completely abandon your brain on entry to be able to enjoy it, let alone log in here to rate it highly. This movie is an utter insult to anyone with an IQ above 80 willing to think for just mere seconds at a time. And I'm not even kidding with that.Just a few questions highlighting the ridiculous plot and even more ridiculous plot holes:*SPOILERS FOLLOW* Why the *piieep* does Kirk hide the Enterprise within the ocean of an undeveloped planet? He could have just orbited it. Since when do Enterprise class *space*ships also have a *submarine* function by the way? How does Khan get a top level Starfleet officer to blow up himself plus his super top secret Starfleet agency AFTER saving his daughter? By asking nicely? After the blowing up of the archive, how does Khan get flying to a top secret Starfleet (MILITARY!!) meeting with ALL TOP DOGS present.. completely unnoticed, with the perimeter completely *unguarded and defenseless*? Are you kidding me?? Instead of simply using a missile which would have killed anyone present instantly Khan uses some kind of phaser machine gun on the room, gunning for minutes but leaving many alive and even unharmed? Art thou joking or something? After his ship gets blown up by Kirk with a fire extinguisher (is that a joke or what?) how the *piieep* does Khan beam out with a standard issue *portable* beamdevice to a Klingon planet *lightyears* away? While just before an *Enterprise-class* beamdevice can't even get a normal fix on Spock in a volcano a few *miles* away? Please.How the hell does Khan get access to his 72 man crew, putting them in 72 torpedoes, while exactly that crew was used by the admiral to blackmail him in the first place? Why the hell would Khan put them in torpedoes in the first place if he had access to them, in stead of just defreezing them? Why would the admiral load all 72 super top secret torpedoes created onto Enterprise, while only 1 or 2 would be needed for the mission? Apparently with the bloody things never even *tested*?? And no-one made the ""hey 72 torpedoes -> 72 Khan crew missing"" connection? Why would the torpedoes created by Khan to save his crew be set sharp to explode 'on touch' in the first place? You'd expect Khan to disable them? And ofcouse just blindly janking out some part of it by some blonde babe that knows nothing about them miraculously stops the detonation 1 second before blow-up.. Since when do Startrek hand communicators have the ability to communicate over Lightyears distance from the Klingon planet Chronos allllll the way to earth? And at the same time the Enterprise radio can't reach earth for a distress call that they're being shot up by the Big Bad Admiral when it's as close to it as being pulled in by earth's gravity?How does the Enterprise mechanic get into an ultra top secret base with a standard issue Starfleet Shuttle unnoticed? How did he even get his hands on the shuttle in the first place, since he resigned his position/function? How (and WHY actually?) does the Enterprise mechanic get into an ultra top secret highly secured battleship? How does he get into a minutes long conversation with an undoubtedly commando-class crewman while being found AFTER disabling the ship with EVERYONE looking for an intruder with the order to put him down IMMEDIATELY, giving The Good Mechanic the chance to open the airlock for Kirk to get in?And so on and so forth. And I'm not even touching character interaction yet.I have no idea where the writers of this nonsensical dribble learned to write a plot but I'd suggest them to pick up another job. Cleaning toilets or something would be a great start.

945,natalisek,Good Travel,10,10 May 2013,"Why did I see the Star Trek' 2009 in the first place is – I really liked the way Carl Urban moved his jaw in ""Dredd"" and got interested in his filmography. And he was good in the part of mean doctor Bones and I got to love the movie as well, not actually being the fan of the series or of any previous films. I loved it for its characters, its heart, its humor and intense action. Authors, do some more! And they did, though a bit differently this time. The following simile came to my mind: the 2009 film is a flower-chocolates period of a romantic relationship, when there's love, lightness and energy, but the future is yet unclear. Whereas ""Star Trek Into Darkness"" is the family-life alright, with habits and fights (see Spock and Uhura), but with solidity and profoundness. I think this is right, because one cannot jump around and just be funny for long, there must be seriousness and growth, etc.Thus we have the film about Kirk's growing up, while traveling from attack to negotiation, from being reckless to being responsible, from empty foolhardiness to personal heroism. And he did surpass his heroic Dad, got reborn and his dream came true. Hooray! J.J. Abrams having successfully expanded Star Trek fan base the last time, now is humoring, I think, the hardcore fans of the series, hence the multiple moral dilemmas, the uneasy decisions and heavy pathos of the ending.There could be a little less action and the mentioned pathos and there could be a little more of the arrogant, tragically controversial figure of Khan (absolutely lovely in his ugliness Benedict C.), otherwise the film is perfect! Do some more, J.J., and may the Force be with you on Star Wars!",Star Trek Into Darkness
946,mailofphilip,"Better than the first one, but still uninspired",6,4 September 2013,"While I found the first remake to be just bad, the second try by JJA is better, story wise. That is mainly due to the fact, that it is now somewhat more believable that Kirk is actually in charge of the ship. Not necessarily because he acts like he is a Captain who, after gaining a lot of experience has finally gained command of his own starship, but because this is the second movie and at least it feels like he did not take command after a mere few days at the academy. The biggest problem with JJAs whole vision for the remakes is still that it feels like he would rather make an 1980s coming of age movie. The villain in this movie is good. Not as good as Heath Ledgers Joker, but still good. The FX is of course great, though using a brewery as the setting for the ships machine room stills feels wrong. The story is OK, though there are is a terrible deus ex machina at the ending. No themes which have not been incorporated into any Star Trek story in the past, but solid action. The references to Star Trek lore are sometimes funny, sometimes they feel like the writers had no better idea, and some are simply misplaced. All in all a solid movie and good entertainment, but like the first one uninspired.",Star Trek Into Darkness

948,elspeth-graham,The climax of this film left something to be desired.,7,22 February 2014,"I liked the climax of the film, but I also didn't like it. The characters and their actions begin to come together in the last 1/2 hour - providing the beginning point of things which come together in Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan. The intentions of the writers and directors were good, I'm sure. However, the plot, IMO, had to be forced in order to bring about the climax - which left me somewhat disappointed. There are a couple of things which were left out of this film which I would like to have seen. First, who brought Khan and his fellow ""supermen"" to the planet Ceti Alpha V? The Enterprise? Not likely given that the re-christened Enterprise is setting off on its 5 year mission.The second missing item is in regards to the Federation-Klingon war. Wouldn't it have already occurred given that the Neutral Zone has been in place for many years? It's not entirely clear - would this breach of the Neutral Zone (by the Enterprise) actually provoke the beginning of a second war? It's left up to the viewer's imagination - or maybe I missed this when watching ST:TOS or ST:TNG. In any case, this is something which could have relatively easy to weave into this film's plot.It's for the above reasons that I gave this movie a rating of only 7 out of 10.",Star Trek Into Darkness

953,tylerlee0622,A loud mess,5,10 June 2013,"Let me begin this review with a proper statement, this is not a personal thing, but I'll be completely honest. First and foremost I have no interest in Star Trek. I never have and never will. I personally don't have time to sit down and watch entire seasons of the original series like some shut-in, I'm fat enough as it is. But I know a broad scope of Star Trek, I know what's the difference between William Shatner and Chris Pine when it comes to James T. Kirk, but I honestly do not give a crap, my only concern is, what justifies films as a good movie, and JJ Abram's recent outing is just a straight up loud mess.My first complaint is also one of it's strong suits. In terms of cinematography, it was really good looking, the effects are spot on and they don't ""clip"" with the actual film. However, each time I got somewhat interested in a certain aspect of the photography, I was shoved into another even louder scene with even crazier ""shaky cam"". For the first few minutes (by which you're already thrown into chaotic action) you're bewildered by a bright red alien forest, Peter Jackson's tribal people from King Kong and a faux-Indiana Jones (I'm guessing this is foreshadowing Abrams's monopoly over the Indiana Jones series as well, I mean why not?) scene, all of which is accompanied by loud explosions and constant back and forth yelling of pre-established personalities. I recall developing my headache early on, and I'm relived I didn't see the 3D, IMAX rendition of it, because I'm sure I would've been put into a coma.Pre-established personalities is also one of this movies biggest faults, the reason why I actually liked the first Star Trek movie was because everybody grew up in the first film. The various character arcs (as basic as they were), were effective because it was a clean slate for the series. I mean how many people in the audience actually have watched the original series? But. And this is a big but, how can you as a screenwriter actually rewrite the entire first film? I mean this is virtually the same film as the last, just with a bigger budget and twenty minutes longer.Virtually nobody is developed beyond a one dimensional cardboard cutout. They basically focused solely on a false sense of nostalgia and never built up from it. Kirk is the charming rogue, Spock plays by the rules, Bones is grumpy, Scotty is wacky, the list goes on, yet it never breaks from it's basic caste. So not is only everything straightforward and boring, but the plot and action brings nothing to the drama. Do I care if Spock's relationship is falling apart? What will happen when they catch John Harrison? We never really feel any risks, because there are none. It's essentially a foam paved playground. Everything sharp is there, it's just unable to take any effect because we're too afraid of making drastic moves. For a better analogy, all bark, no bite.Another one of the biggest issues I have is the standard villain archetype. Benedict Cumberbatch, as talented as he is, falls flat as a standard post-9/11 dual villain. He is calculating, he has a bigger picture, yet he is every other movie villain in recent Hollywood productions. The only thing that makes him stand out is his Alan Rickman-esque tone. But other than that, he doesn't really stand out. Additionally, the twist is so forced and insecure in it's own delivery, it's not only one of the weakest writing jobs I've ever muddled through, but it's one of the biggest slap in the face of a loyal fan base. I mean there's nothing scary about a super strong anglo-saxon with a nazi haircut and a turtleneck.By the end of the film, the story becomes so candy-coated, simplistic and juvenile for a lack of a better word. Nothing feels at stake, everything is exploding. Spaceships are crashing into cities, yet in the background you see people still trying to get to work. The believability of everything that's happening on the screen is exaggerated to such an exorbitant degree, it's not only visually exasperating, but jejune. The ultimate finale is lame brained and sets up for a sequel, but unlike The Wrath of Khan, Into Darkness is just an ugly stepson to the original 2009 film.I know there will be many of naysayers out there, but the fact remains the same, nothing in this movie stands out. For something with such a high, ridiculous budget I'd expect far better quality then what was delivered, but than again, just look at World War Z. JJ Abrams might have both the classic Sci-fi franchises in his hands now, but I'm very nervous about the direction he's taking them (not to say Star Wars was not already brutally beaten and put on life support). And call me incredibly pretentious for saying this, but there are far better Science Fiction pieces (Moon, Sunshine, Cloud Atlas, Prometheus, Looper etc.) in recent memory, because this isn't Sci-fi, this is just a lame brained action film. Mr. Abrams, you are no Stanley Kubrick.",Star Trek Into Darkness

However after a questionable decision on their last mission, Kirk finds himself out of favour with Starfleet command. Enter John Harrison, a rogue Starfleet operative with a taste for the melodramatic and a penchant for things that go boom. Kirk volunteers himself and crew to track down Harrison and bring him to justice but along the way Kirk discovers that not everything he believes in may be true.To go any further would be wrong and evil and spoil your enjoyment of the movie but let's just say there are some fantastic revelations which may take you by surprise.The tone remains much the same as the first movie although the secondary characters seem to get a bit more screen time on this mission. Chris Pine is a solid Kirk, displaying the bull-headed nature and incredible ego that Shatner bestowed upon his creation. Zachary Quinto nails Spock, getting the underlying struggle between his human and Vulcan origins just right.Newcomer to the series, Benedict Cumberbatch has an amazing screen presence, oozing menace yet at the same time capturing the essence of an arch manipulator who is just as deadly with his mind games as with a bomb.The movie belts along close to warp speed and the action sequences are slick and polished. The interplay between the crew of the Enterprise is entertaining and believable, giving nods to fans of the original TV show as well as keeping things contemporary.There is one moment in the film which Trek fans will either love or hate. I'm not going to spoil it but there is a section of the film where.....well I'm not going to say but if you are a fan you'll know it when you get to it!This is near enough the best film that I've seen this year and it pretty much lives up to the hype.

The action is swift and eye catching, literally in 3D, but the under-laying message is a reflection of the society we live in today.

If you never heard of Star Trek before, no problem as this film plays out in its own way.

From the opening sequence to the closing credits I was immersed in this world of space exploration and military operations. Not to mention easy to watch captains and their crew. This is the first time I have seen Benedict Cumberbatch in anything and I thought he was marvelous, every time he was on screen I was expecting something evil to happen, his manipulation of Kirk and the crew to get his way was magnificent to watch, his demands to Spock and his explanation of how there was no logical way to disagree was so enthralling, I could have watched him alone for hours.Similarly I could watch Chris Pine run around and get beat up for hours also so this movie ticked all the boxes in that respect. However, I did feel this film made him stretch more with his acting abilities and has to be the best film I've seen him in. Zachary Quinto is equally brilliant and the friendship dynamic between the two characters is great to watch on screen. I was a fan of the first Star Trek film and it was so much fun to see everyone come back to their roles and reanimate the crew of the Enterprise, the relationships between everyone makes you want to be involved and be a part of their world - kind of like the cool kids at school. There is plenty of action to keep you busy as the story moves along and it was wonderful to see more of Simon Pegg in this one. I wouldn't classify myself as a 'Trekkie', I'm familiar with the Star Trek Universe and some of the characters and story lines but have no specific loyalty to anything or anyone and I think that helped me enjoy the film for what it is, I wasn't offended by any changes or anything that didn't relate to previous Star Trek time lines (although I empathise when this happens - I was equally offended by the remake of Clash of the Titans) but if you go this movie and accept and enjoy it for what it is there is no way you can come out and feel let down or un- entertained. 1000 stars to the cast and crew of Star Trek Into Darkness. I hope to god that JJ finishes the third one. Go, enjoy and have fun - a thrilling movie from start to finish.",Star Trek Into Darkness
958,peaceriver,Terrible and Tired,2,1 June 2013,"The paucity of ideas in this film is mind-numbing. J.J. Abrams has jumped the shark. This is just tedious as hell. Easily one of the most dreary movies in the series. Endless, repetitive, seen-it-all-before action sequences until I wanted to scream. I never cared a whit about any of the characters. I just sat there waiting for the movie to actually engage or BECOME something other than just a retread or reversal of ideas from the first movie series: Ideas that were inspired the first time around and now are used just to wink at the audience and try to pump up emotion that isn't there. And, if you want the audience to cry, the worst thing you can do is have all the characters crying or tearing up in the scene that's mean to provoke such a reaction. It's one of the oldest rules in the book, but nobody here seems to have learned it. Mainly, I just---felt--nothing. Sitting there waiting for this endless loud claptrap to end. Really weak. Oh, and it's obvious that so many sequences are designed purely for the 3D experience without working independently or having emotional impact. Which means you might as well be on a ride at a theme park. A truly empty-headed movie.",Star Trek Into Darkness
959,rpainemail-misc2,Excellent addition to Star Trek,10,16 May 2013,"I just saw Star Trek Into Darkness in Imax 3D and enjoyed every minute of it!It was filled with references to past Trek that should please fans, while offering plenty of suspense and action for the average summer moviegoer. Although not as obvious as in some past Trek plot lines, there were also some moral dilemmas and social commentaries to satisfy those viewers seeking some take-home message from the film. For example, there was an apparent criticism of the current US policy to execute suspected terrorists overseas with drones and without a trial. It was also nice to see an exception to the blind obedience of the ""Prime Directive"" (non-interference in alien cultures) that has been used both in Trek and in real life as an excuse to avoid responsibility for the well-being of others. As with many of the ""reboots"" that Hollywood is feeding us, those familiar with Star Trek II might feel that this new film is too derivative and lacking in originality. However, both Star Trek II and Star Trek Into Darkness (Star Trek XII) are sufficiently strong films to stand alone or to complement each other. One would certainly gain a greater appreciation for the strengths of this new film by watching Star Trek II again. Overall this film had excellent acting and special effects with more subtle yet powerful moral dilemmas than recent Trek films and than Star Trek II. I wish only that Paramount would use this cast for a new Star Trek television series.",Star Trek Into Darkness

Worth every cent. I hate 3D. I went to see Avatar in 3d, and was dizzy and headachey for hours. But this went better. I sat with my eyes closed for 5 mins at the end of the film. I still weaved like a drunk for a while, but so far, an hour and a half later, no headache. I swear I ducked space debris. I was in space wrecks and bomb attacks (I really have been in a IRA bomb attack, the difference is that a forceful wind pushes you off your feet as debris flies past and thank god, over you.) I found myself studying the bad skin of Chris Pine(Kirk) and flawless skin, but beard shadow of Zackery Quinto (Spock)If they were wearing make up it was very well done. Not only do you need perfect skin to survive 3D, but perfect acting responses, blink in the wrong direction and this format up close and personal picks it up. Quinto is channelling Nemoy 100%, and Zoe Saldana is Uluhu as she was, short 60s skirts and high boots. Why did it take so long to discover this actress? She is more than interesting. Chris Pine is Kirk and that is not a good thing. Sulu is a different person, and not better or worse for it, just different. The casters went out of their way to put all human types/ethnicities/colours in all the bit parts as well as aliens. Yes, this is a totally believable future world. Benedict Cumberbach is a busy guy, he is in everything, and on stage, and here he is an outstanding villain. Looking nothing like the older version, nor sounding like, but so menacing! the storyline is totally expected, see skyfall! But well told and the special effects are awesome.

961,sacjmc,Can't understand the venomous reviews,10,16 September 2013,"Let me start off with saying I watched the original series when it was an original series. Never was a fan of Next Generation or DS9, Voyager was OK until it got boring, and Enterprise just never grabbed me. Watched the first 6 movies, skipped 7, kind of liked 8, and wrote off the rest. I enjoyed the hell out of Star Trek in 2009 and was really looking forward to this one. Finally got the DVD and I LOVED IT!!!!! I cannot for the life of me understand what the naysayers are complaining about, because this is a Star Trek movie through and through. I have no idea what movie the hand-wringers watched, but it wasn't this one. I can guarantee that Into Darkness went into the ""movie I can watch anytime"" category in my house - I've had it for three days and watched it twice already!",Star Trek Into Darkness
962,simon-680-399511,"Not yet complete Star Trek, but more than worth looking",8,8 May 2013,"Honestly, I hated the 09 Abrams-Trek Star Wars rip off, he called ""Star Trek"" It wasn't anything near the core of Star Trek: Thinking of plausible looking and sounding future technology and solutions to moral problems combined and told with a good story. He had only a story telling, without a Star Trek story.Now, with the second film in the new ""time line"" he keeps the fast action from his 09 movie and brings this action nearer to the Star Trek core: A plausible Story, nice references to the old Trek and at least a pseudo moral dilemma as a story element.Over all, it can't compete with the TMP era movies or the TNG series in matters of moral/philosophical dilemmas as a background, but for now, it's OK.The movie managed to convince me to make my peace with the Abrams version of Trek.It's a movie more than worth looking, and it shows a promising development. If the writers are taking ""moral/philosophical problems"" as their core material like the writers of the TMP movies did, i can't see a problem in making Star Trek more fast action based.

963,saulmasters27,No where near as good as the first but it does entertain.,7,16 May 2013,"Star Trek: Into Darkness is JJ Abrams' follow up to his rebooting, alternate universe version of Star Trek. And where the first film succeeded this follow up attempts to keep up with its predecessor but stumbles and fails.The sequel sees Kirk and the crew of the U.S.S. Enterprise travel to the edges of the federation space to catch super human terrorist, John Harrison (Benedict Cumberbatch). Driven by revenge Kirk has to take on a more mature leadership style if he is to survive what he faces. Abrams' first installment did a great job of building up the initial excitement of the Kirk and Spock bromance. The chemistry shared between Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto, who plays an uncharismatic character with charisma perfectly, worked perfectly with the conflict and friendship, grating up against each other. But now we see the honeymoon phase fade off and the relationship hasn't exactly flowered into a beautiful marriage. The sequel starts off with all guns blazing with Spock dropped into a active volcano and Kirk and Bones running from a tribe out for their blood.",Star Trek Into Darkness
964,historyphdguy,The Same but Different in this Star Trek Universe,10,16 May 2013,"SPOILER ALERT!!! SPOILER ALERT!!! You have been warned!!!Others have detailed the plot specifics so I will go with my own perspective as a lifelong Star Trek fan who started watching TOS in syndicated rerun in the mid-70's. Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan is my favorite Star Trek movie by far and it is in my list of the Top 10 films of all-time. So I was a bit concerned when I read the rumors on the Internet that Cumberbatch was going to reprise this iconic Science Fiction role in Star Trek: Into Darkness. I felt that JJ & company needed to do something different since they had created an alternate timeline with the first movie. I think the writing team had given lots of thought of parallel universes and how certain points and people are fixed in time in all possible universes. The work they did on Fringe pushed them to do several seasons worth of story about an alternate universe. Peter was their fixed person in the Fringe universe who impacted both realities. The writers looked at Khan the same way. I had to think about the plot threads of terrorism, betrayal, security, revenge, optimism, family and trust that were weaved through Into Darkness after seeing it Wednesday night. I then read the novelization and the prequel graphic novel to gain a better perspective before I went and watched the movie again today. The main themes hit by this story are many such as Kirk being too young, impetuous, inexperienced, undisciplined, egotistical, etc., to command a starship effectively; Spock still suffering emotionally from the traumatic loss of his home-world and his mother while trying to connect with his erratic, emotional, impulsive Captain; Starfleet Command reacting badly to the devastating terror attack by Nero against Vulcan and Starfleet in the previous film causing Starfleet Command to turn to extraordinary extra-legal actions to bring security to the Federation despite undermining the very freedoms and ethics espoused by the Federation (Section 31); Scotty being the one crew member (besides Spock) willing to take a moral stand with Kirk over crossing the line of legality and ethics while Kirk & Starfleet are preoccupied with revenge against Khan. So to me this wasn't a rehash of Wrath of Khan because that story was about coming to terms with growing older and feeling that life had passed you by. Kirk's past comes back to haunt him and the Enterprise and Kirk finally had to face his own Kobyashi Maru test with Spock's sacrifice. Khan was motivated by his need for vengeance against Kirk over the loss of his wife and being left marooned on a doomed planet. This too was an issue from Khan's past he could not let go and it was his undoing. ST:ID is about surviving the vicissitudes of youth and learning from your mistakes to mature into a better sentient being connected to your friends and society. Kirk had Pike to place his faith and trust in him even when Kirk had royally screwed up from the hubris of flagrantly violating the Prime Directive on Nibiru even as Kirk failed to recognize this error. It took Pike's death and the pursuit of Khan to bring Kirk to the realization that he had to change his worldview and behavior. Spock was struggling with his inner demons over the loss of Vulcan and his mother. He also made a personal journey of self-discovery in ST:ID especially after Kirk sacrificed himself to save the ship. Spock is filled with rage and pursues Khan with a fury never seen before. He helps save his friend Jim Kirk and he can now acknowledge this friendship and let it evolve.Starfleet Command reacted like the US did after 9/11. They undermined their own principles in the name of imagined security. Admiral Marcus had sent out ships looking for resources to help Starfleet defend the Federation and they found the Botany Bay. Admiral Marcus thought he could exploit Khan's genetically engineered superior intellect and his capacity for violence to give the clandestine Section 31 (think CIA/Homeland Security/Special Forces) an advantage in building a capacity to take on the biggest perceived threat to the Federation for Admiral Marcus... the Klingon Empire. Thus you get the top-secret special prototype photon torpedoes and the built for combat USS Vengeance along with who knows what else that didn't get mentioned. You get incidents manipulated to provoke a state of war with the Klingons. All justified in the name of security. Scotty was just awesome in this story. He was a moral compass while getting in on the action with the sabotage of the USS Vengeance. He also got some more great comedic scenes and lines. I was a bit disappointed that Bones didn't get more involved in this story but since it involved more technological issues I can see why Scotty was used rather than McCoy. Bones still got in some great metaphors and scenes and you know he can deliver Gorn babies in a crisis situation. Sulu gets a taste of the command chair and Checkov gets to flex his savant genius abilities as Scotty's replacement (temporarily) as Chief Engineer. Uhura has some issues with Spock, talks up some Klingons, battles some Klingons & makes some tough long distance calls. Getting a young Carol Marcus was cool and they didn't force her to be romantically involved with Kirk, She gets to join the crew and maybe they will hook up in the next installment. The Big E gets a refit to repair her battle damage and the crew of the USS Enterprise embark on the start of what should be an eventful, glorious and historic Five-Year Mission to Boldly Go Where No One Has Gone Before.",Star Trek Into Darkness

967,shankar-sankararaman,"An amazing roller coaster ride, which falls just short of its predecessor",8,20 May 2013,"How to pack a ton of emotions into an action-filled science fiction adventure? We should probably ask JJ Abrams and his team to teach a short course on this topic. It was an era of reboots and sequels when the 2009 Star Trek movie arrived with a bang to the theaters, and J.J. Abrams impeccably rewrote the character sketches of the entire Enterprise crew. In the 2013 sequel, the writers decide to take these characters, play with their emotions, create scenes and sequences that push these characters to the brink of their emotional balance, and provide an amazing roller coaster ride for the audience.Half an hour into the movie, we are exposed to some spectacular visuals, impressive acting of Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto as Kirk and Spock respectively, beautiful dialogues, and excellent writing. For example, when Admiral Pike questions Spock, ""Are you showing an attitude to a superior officer?!"", Spock responds, ""Actually, I am showing multiple attitudes. Which one are you talking about!?"" There is so much subtle humor infused throughout the movie that you would burst out laughing on numerous occasions which would otherwise be extremely tense.Enter Benedict Cumberbatch as John Harrison to blow off a Star fleet building in London. Scratch all those two-year old rumors claiming that Benedict was playing Khan! Enterprise starts off on a seemingly simple chase to track John Harrison, and even manages to capture him. But as we have already seen in The Avengers, The Dark Knight, etc., capturing the villain is only the beginning. After a couple of twists and turns, Enterprise is on the verge of destruction, and its crew members are staring into imminent death. Just like the 1982 Wrath of Khan, sacrifices need to be made to restore order.The writing and direction show off their mastery over character development and emotions, in addition to creating stunning action sequences. The music was further expanded from the 2009 movie, and was aptly suited to the story line. The cinematography blended so well with the special effects that certain sequences were mind blowing, for instance, the atmospheric re-entry scene. On the contrary, the movie was not as taut as the 2009 film; may be the simplicity of the first venture of JJ Abrams was lacking in its sequel. Also lacking were certain original science fiction elements which were present in the older films; while there is mention of genetic engineering, cryo-beds, etc., they are not wholly key to the central plot.I had one of the most unique experiences watching Star Trek Into Darkness. The first ever Star Trek movie I watched was the 2009 reboot. I had made up my mind to get acquainted with the original movies before I watched the 2013 movie. Being the procrastinator I am, it did not happen until the Monday prior to the release of Star Trek Into Darkness. I started watching the ""original motion picture"" on Monday evening, and given the spectacular bore it is, I did not finish watching it until Thursday evening. I was planning to go watch Into Darkness on Saturday, and started watching ""Wrath of Khan"" late night on Friday. I finished the first hour of the movie; though I really hate watching movies in installments, I could not complete the movie, and the latter half of Wrath of Khan had to wait. However, in retrospect, I ended up having an amazing one-of-a-kind experience. On Saturday morning, I watched ""Into Darkness"" at the theater, and came back home to complete ""Wrath of Khan"". Wow, what an excellent experience the entire thing turned out to be! Did JJ Abrams deliberately choose to pay his respects to the epic 1982 film? What a superb homage!What I saw:Direction: 3.5/5 Writing: 4.0/5 Acting: 4.0/5 Music: 3.5/5 Cinematography: 3.5/5What I felt:Degree of Tautness: 3.5/5 Emotional Quotient: 4.5/5 Intelligence Quotient: 3.5/5 Entertainment Quotient: 4.0/5",Star Trek Into Darkness

969,expressjordan,Fun watch but that's about it...,4,20 May 2013,"Star Trek Into the Darkness Review:When it was announced that Star Trek was going to be rebooted in 2009 as a prequel with the original crew from the TV series and first movies, I had some mixed feelings. On the one hand, I thought that a prequel with a younger/different set of actors but the same characters we know and love, along with new special effects, would be pretty cool! On the other hand, I knew they could easily screw it up if they weren't careful. In short, I think they did a good job in the 2009 Star Trek, but I think they dropped the ball on this one.Spoilers are ahead so please, if you haven't seen this movie, watch it first.I want to start out by saying that I actually really had a good time at the movie theater watching this. The special effects were great, the acting was excellent (especially from Benedict Cumberpatch!) and I liked that we didn't need an introduction to the characters as that was done previously. However, there was very much to be disappointed about here. Even though the action was good and acting was even better, in reflection, I do feel a bit cheated.Since you must have seen the movie if you're reading this, I'll start to say that several parts were RIPPED OFF from the second original movie (1982) which is widely regarded as the best Star Trek movie ever. I would pretty much agree with Wrath of Khan's title as the best movie, but it was shameful to reuse so many plot devices in this movie, like the radiation room scene at the end, as well as the resurrection of a main character. This was incredibly disappointing, which was terrible as I was really liking the movie up until then (sparring a few very specifics I would have easily overlooked).Benedict Cumberpatch said in an interview, I believe, that he is NOT Khan. While that wasn't true, I appreciate him saying that as it would have easily ruined the reveal (though there were a few hints, one being he was ""genetically altered""). However, after seeing what the script did with the movie from there, I can safely say that THE SCRIPT RUINED IT ANYWAY.Spock's ""KKKHHHHHAAAANNNNNNN!!"" along with the above-mentioned ending was SO disappointing, that everything else about the movie that was actually pretty good is easily forgotten. Doing my best to list some additional positive points, I did really enjoy the story BEFORE Khan's reveal, as well as seeing so much of London and San Francisco in the 23rd century! I particularly liked the very beginning where the crew of the Enterprise saved a primitive species on some ""Class M"" planet from extinction by stopping a volcano. It was very exciting to see that technology and I love how they were not to be seen (though they didn't succeed...) That parallels the ""Ancient Astronaut"" theories about spaceships and flying men that our ancient ancestors supposedly saw. I will say, however, that putting the Enterprise under water was fairly ridiculous.... I'm curious how they got the ship IN THE WATER without being seen... seems a rather large plot hole there, considering, as one reviewer said, they could easily have stayed in orbit and beamed back and forth and/or used a transport to/from the planet.Did anyone notice the very attractive addition to the crew, ""Carol Marcus""? I'm sure you would have still noticed her without her having to get half-naked for NO APPARENT REASON. While as a flesh-and-blood straight guy, that was nice, it had nothing to do with the movie and was clearly put in there JUST FOR THE TRAILER. Believe it or not, I went to see Star Trek Into The Darkness because the trailer made the movie IN GENERAL look good, not because I saw a half-naked woman on the screen and wanted more..... again, shameful. Speaking of Carol Marcus, if you remember Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan, didn't James T Kirk have a fling with a Science Officer named Carol? The IMDb listing for her character simply says Carol, but if I remember correctly in the movie (though it's been nearly a decade since I've seen it), I think she was in fact ""Carol Marcus"" .... Hmm... obviously we'll see her in at LEAST one more Star Trek movie as Kirk needs to get busy with her if he is to have a son from her. While I realize events don't need to play out as exactly as they did in the other movies (the time-line has been altered) it probably will if the writers continue to be this absent-minded and unoriginal.All-in-all, I'm a bit disappointed with the movie, THOUGH it was fun to watch. When the movie ended, I in fact said ""Cool!"" to myself and had a smile on my face, but in reflection I think the writers REALLY didn't put their ""thinking caps"" on for this one. This is so sad considering the budget they had as well as the importance of not disappointing all the Star Trek fans out there. No offense Trekkies, but I can see them not being INCREDIBLY accurate and pissing off a few people who pay too close attention to the details - it's a movie and it's supposed to be fun - but by ripping off an old villain with a different plot that ends in the SAME WAY AS THE PREVIOUS MOVIE WITH HIM but simply switching characters around is unoriginal and sacrilege in my opinion.The question now is can we forgive them and can they do a better job next time?....808Jordan@gmail.com",Star Trek Into Darkness
970,karensherrybrackett,Abberational Behavior in Star Trek Into Darkness Alien Sex,1,24 May 2013,"Christopher J. Dodd,Star Trek needs to be re-rated to NC-17. There is simply no way the bestiality scene with Kirk and the two alien cat women passes the definition of obscenity and aberrational behavior in regards to sexual content suitable for children. This scene is morally obscene and biologically obscene. While many today wish to insist that the word bestiality with ""a"" is misspelled and even that the word simply does not exist, they are blatantly wrong. Bestiality is animal behavior but bestiality with an ""a"" defines the act of a human having sex with an animal or in this case aliens; but most specifically with a creature other than another human being. In addition, I will go so far as to state the writers and directors need a serious dressing down by the movie community worldwide for producing a science fiction product that so directly intellectually degrades and emotional discriminates against women that it is repulsive. We need young women to be interested in the sciences and not discouraged from pursuing them. We do not need film makers promoting an atmosphere which instruct discrimination against women in the work place to extreme point of limiting them to mini skirts and leather boots in space; which is completely illogical. Most concerning however we do not need young men being taught to emotionally neglect their female friends nor create an industry that emotionally grooms young men to being gay. There should be a law against gay writers and producers high-jacking what has been All American Heterosexual Characters and turning them into instruments of gay propagation without at least requiring a rating that indicates such product is what it being sold. There are millions of Americas male and female who are disappointed and feel robbed at the ticket counter for having purchased a ticket to see Into Darkness. Quiet Frankly, the name could not have been more appropriately titled because it has in fact taken the motion picture industry and the world into darkness of moral depravity and intellectual slavery.The article released in the Daily News that Abrams has now offered an olive branch to female audiences by providing a shower scene with Cumberbatch's character only acts as proof that he has no moral compass to even begin to understand the hurt and pain he has done to the young minds of America. He thinks his mistake is about skin exposure when it has nothing to do with skin exposure. It has to do emotionally degrading the character development of human love to a peekaboo trick. His new behavior in releasing the cut shower scene is so concerning that I am now in the position of suggesting you start an investigation into his behavior towards young actors. If he filmed this scene for his own private collection and gratification, he has violated Cumberbatch's right to a work environment void of sexual harassment. Not to mention, releasing a cut scene does not compensate for the financial thief he has done at the box office.In closing, the script in time formula alone so vastly promotes male to male emotional bonding out of equilibrium with male to female emotional bonding, in an obvious purposeful attempt to enslave women and men into emotional numbness; that its effects may do so much generational harm in emotional development of our people even older than 17, to the point that the entire film needs to be banned all together. I only came to that conclusion after reading hundreds of comments on line of women complaining about their treatment in the film; while men comments clearly indicated that they could not even understand what was wrong. When I complained about the film to a grown male friend who works in government, he actually replied to me that the only reason women would ever be allowed in space would because of mini skirts and leather boots. If adults are being groomed by this film so severely to think this way, imagine the impact this film is having world wide on young minds. At the very least, Star Trek Into Darkness needs to be NC-17 and I seriously suggest the film be banned from any form of distribution altogether.Sincerely,Karen Sherry Brackett",Star Trek Into Darkness
971,Treknologist,An awesome film!,9,25 May 2013,"I've been waiting a long, long time for this movie and I have to admit, I'm impressed. Chris Pine is definitely a better actor since the last ""Trek"" and Zachary Quinto is particularly impressive as Spock. The special effects are off the charts and the ""Enterprise"" looks beautiful. Now, the villains. Benedict Cumberbatch couldn't be more awesome as John Harrison/Khan. Every one of his scenes steals the show and makes you feel bad for his character. He aces all of the lines, emotions, and expressions like he invented the role. He definitely should have had more screen time. The only thing I didn't like is that his main use of superhuman strength in this movie was to...break people's bones?? Admiral Marcus is not a good villain. He's just not what a villain ought to be. Kind of boring, really. Also, Carol Marcus could have been developed better, as a character. Alice Eve's talent is wasted for sure. I didn't like all the plot-holes either. I mean, reviving people with superhuman blood? Come on! Why didn't they show us HOW they got Khan back into his cryogenic tube? Why did Kirk and Spock get into a battle with Khan after he TOLD them he didn't feel pain? Why did old Spock show up to tell the crew what they already knew? Why did Kirk take the 73(?) cryogenic tubes with him on their exploration trip at the end? Why was the ending so easily resolved? Why did Pike die so early on? Why was Admiral Marcus not killed in an epic fight scene between him and Khan? What was with those awkward, unneeded scenes (ie. Alice Eve's changing scene, Kirk with the Alien women, Khan and Kirk unrealistically blasting through space with jet-packs, and lots more)? Part two in the making or lazy ways of getting out of writing better solutions? I will admit, though, Kirk's death at the end and Spock's reaction to it was sad. You will cry for sure. The minor characters (Bones, Sulu, Scotty, Chekov, Uhura, etc.) are developed nicely and you'll like them more at the end. If this was just another sci-fi movie, I'd give it a 7.8/10. But Cumberbatch, the cast, the effects, the music, the acting and the overall action is totally worth a 9.

I was a fan of TOS and TNG but must admit to getting totally board with the other spin offs. As predicted the powers that be killed the goose that laid the golden egg. But J.J. Abrams brought that goose back to life the only way it could be done. He went back to basics and rebuilt the entire franchise. Seeing Kirk, Spock, McCoy and the rest in a completely new perspective is exciting and refreshing and was long overdue. I really liked the first Trek film Abrams produced but Into Darkness is a Trek masterpiece. He has preserved the major elements of Trek and its original characters played extraordinarily by this new cast and given them a whole new dimension. True to Roddenberry's idea, this new trek uses current world events as a basis to tell a sophisticated story. Abrams' interpretation of an earlier Star Trek plot was brilliant giving fans of the original series and films something new to discover while those having never seen Trek before, a movie as exciting as any Sci-Fi film out there today. Star Trek has established its own universe in these last 40 plus years. But it is a work of fiction and if the deviations of this new iteration of Trek disturbs your expectations of what Trek should be, you are cheating yourself out of some wonderful entertainment.",Star Trek Into Darkness
973,heycwalker,Awesome!!!,10,1 June 2013,"Saw this in IMAX incredible! Another great JJ Abrams film, beginning to end. My wife who isn't really into SciFi movies has really enjoyed both the Star Trek re-gens and I agree they are great. Can't wait for next one. The cast has great chemistry and they subtle way they pay honor to the original cast is uncanny, especially Karl Urban as Bones and Simon Pegg as Scotty.Benedict Cumberbatch is a great actor, really like him in the Sherlock TV series, and he does great at breathing new life into the character Khan, from the original movies.Also liked the ending with it leading and reminding us of the original series that made it famous, with a mission to boldly go where no human has gone before. :-)Star Trek fan or not, if you like action movies, go see this, and if you can still catch it in IMAX, even better. You won't be disappointed.Thanks for another great movie.",Star Trek Into Darkness
974,parkey9,"A fun, visually compelling movie where nothing makes any sense",3,14 September 2013,"This movie bothered me. I enjoyed all the performances (except maybe Chekov). It was exciting with great special effects. Overall, it was an enjoyable film. But here's the problem. Very, very little of the plot makes a lick of sense whatsoever. Why are so many critics (both newspaper reviewers and Youtube reviewers) giving this such high marks when the actual story line is painfully devoid of...oh, what's that word Spock's always using? It's kind of one of his most important ideals.....oh yeah, LOGIC!*Spoilers*So the Federation happens upon Khan, wakes him up, and upon ascertaining that he is both mentally and physically superior to the average human, they force him to make better starships and weapons for them? Someone who's three hundred years old? Okay, maybe they had him take an engineering course to catch him up on the advances that happened in three centuries, but isn't there a better use for him? He says they needed his savagery. Why? To design torpedoes that are undetectable and a ship the size of a small moon? That takes savagery? And he's such a genius that he is duped by the Federation? So his answer is to smuggle his frozen crew in something designed to explode? How did he get his hands on his crew? If he could get a hold of SEVENTY-TWO cryogenically frozen people, why wouldn't he just wake them up? Why would he go through the trouble of putting them into something that will certainly kill them once it's out of his sight? But then he says that the Federation discovered his plan...but then they didn't do anything about it? They left the bodies in the torpedoes? I guess they figured the torpedoes would get fired and they wouldn't have to get rid of the bodies. Hey, here's a thought. Why not hold on to the bodies instead? They might come in handy. But that would ruin the plot point where Khan beams them aboard his ship (or so he thinks), so we gotta leave them in the torpedoes.Oh, and as it turns out Khan's blood can cure people who are dying. Maybe not all people who are dying. If you got crushed by a starship crashing towards Earth, it might not help. But it saved at least two people in this film. He has magic blood. MAGIC BLOOD that can keep someone exposed to severe radiation from dying? And you morons are using him to build a bigger spaceship? Certainly this is at least worth looking into, no? And maybe it was, but the audience has no way of knowing because all we see is Khan resting peacefully in a cryogenic chamber at the end. This is the most significant aspect of Khan, and it's used rather unceremoniously to revive a dead man, and then not discussed at all. Nor will it be in future films, I'm sure.So in conclusion, a super intelligent, super strong three hundred year old man with magic blood that can help people cheat death is bested not once, but twice by a Vulcan who tricks him into taking armed torpedoes onto his ship, outruns him as his super legs take him from the scene of a crash, and beats him up (albeit with a little help from his girlfriend) even though Khan killed a dozen Klingon warriors almost completely by himself.Do you see why this movie bothered me? Other than everything I just mentioned, it was a fun, exciting romp.",Star Trek Into Darkness

The director has played around too much with the key protagonists' characteristics. And it doesn't work out well. The story is plebeian and the writing weak. This shows throughout the movie. The sidelining of some excellent characters such as the Doctor has already been mentioned in other reviews. I agree as well. And melodrama seems to have become a substitute for a good story and acting.Overall, the movie was enjoyable while it lasted.

It's an awesome movie, great CGI and JJ Abrams really goes a good job with it. Um, It is hard to follow all the things that are going on, the plot is complicated, and After the movie I read the synopsis, which helped me truly understand how good and complex the movie was. This movie was very well thought out, good character development, and every actor did a wonderful job in their parts. The only reason I'm holding back from giving it a 10/10 is that I thought Inception and Terminator 2: Judgement Day were just a little better. But over all, go watch this movie. Its very fun with lots of action but a great plot surrounding it, The movie is very well balanced. 9.2/10. Its a MUST SEE so go to a theater and see it. NOW!!!",Star Trek Into Darkness

I liked it so much I went to the theater to see it several times. Definitely worth the 2 and a half hours of my life that I gave up to watch it =) it gets a little graphic with the skull crushing but that adds to the epic-ness of it. CAN'T WAIT to see what Star Trek 3 is going to be like. Keep up the good work!!! If you want to see a good movie that is not too graphic (it's a little graphic) and that will keep you on the edge of your seat the whole time, I definitely recommend this movie.

979,dlw_1999,Boldly Going Where It shouldn't,2,20 July 2013,"The film has lots of special effects; lens flares (again?!), odd camera angles, new props, and lots of loud noise. What the film lacks is a script that makes any sense and scenes that are offensive, useless, and contradict previous scenes minutes earlier. It is obvious that JJ Abrams and the writers don't care about the franchise as anything other than a way to make money. I won't give away any of the plot, because there really isn't one in this film. It rips off two other Star Trek films from the 1980s and is very badly written throughout the entire time the film is running. I won't be seeing any more films by this director, as he appears to believe and has stated that he wants this Star Trek to be remembered over the others. Believe me, this is one person who will remember the 2009 and 2013 films as being the worst ever made in the history of Star Trek. Save your money, don't see this film and don't buy the DVD.",Star Trek Into Darkness
980,alex-philip-byron,Why the reboot rechristened hope for Star Trek,9,10 November 2013,"This film, as a film, is brilliant. I echo the numerous reviews from the newspapers and reviewers that say this sequel proved Abrams didn't fluke a great reboot in 2009. Star Trek Into Darkness takes us on a journey into the new, through fast paced visuals and stunning camera-work, whilst rooting itself in the old, with the central plot taking reference from The Wrath of Khan. The cast are, again, loyal to their character's ethics and traits, and Cumberbatch makes a great villain, no doubt about that! I was really disappointed that so many Trekkies gave this film a bad review, not because of its credibility as A film, but rather as a STAR TREK film. Apparently this year's ST convention rated it the worst film in the franchise. There was little doubt that a Star Trek reboot was going to cause some splits in the Trekkie collective! There is one thing, however, that they will all have to agree on: Star Trek was a dying franchise without Abrams' help.Whilst the mighty Next Generation came to a close back in 2002 with it's mediocre run at the box office, most people had assumed closure of the franchise, especially after the cancellation of the TV show Enterprise in the mid-2000s. It is true that Star Trek was just one of many films that was chosen by Hollywood to lead the reboot period (which still rattles on today...).It is a great shame, however, that so many Trekkies have a poor view of the new crew and their movies. Is it the cast choice? The ripping off of the Khan storyline? Did Abrams ignore too much of what Star Trek really is, in both political and philosophical terms? (Yes I would have liked to see more reference to the political and social ethics of the franchise...). None of this matters though! Like the franchise, which ran for decades remember, Star Trek adapted and changed. In both it's philosophical and general nature it was a largely progressive show. When Picard turned up after the original series had closed for good, many, included Stewart himself, were convinced it would not hold. Now TNG is arguably just as well known as Kirk's Trek, and was by far the longest running, and technically the most popular, series in the franchise.My point is this. Abram's reboot forms the next stage of the Star Trek canon. Given the option, I think most moderate Trekkies would say that the choice to reboot Kirk over creating a brand new crew was the right decision (save that for a TV series in 2020s perhaps). Star Trek has a living, breathing soul again. It really does. Added, many people see Star Trek as a way of life! I know that sounds ridiculous, but many (even Patrick Stewart actually) see the Trek future, where humanity is united by the common goal to learn more, and be more than it once was, as something to aspire to. Into Darkness didn't quite show that (until the last scene though), I'll agree.I believe Abrams successfully found a balance though. One that pays respects to the past through Into Darkness's storyline, and both looks to the future, updating a lot of the now out of date bits, and so on. It has provided a base for the next 50 years of series, fans and philosophy.I saw this film on the last week of its run this summer. I was not a Trekkie by any stretch either. But having seen this, I've been drawn to learn about the rest of Trek too, watching the Next Gen over the summer, and now just finishing their 90s/00s films today. Into Darkness has truly helped encourage new fans, like me, to take their place at the franchise's table. I know that it will help plot a new course for the franchise, allowing more to come to recognise and enjoy a series that has inspired the creation of the mobile phone, tablet device, and other technological and social changes throughout the last few decades.Star Trek is changing. I find it very strange that fans of a show like this cannot embrace that. It's quite sad, actually. Whether they like it or not, at the very least Into Darkness has helped ensure that history will never forget the name Enterprise!",Star Trek Into Darkness

For this rating, there should have been multiple spectacular scenes.Agains there is much lack of creativity, the aliens always look similar to humans. Vehicles of distant future still look like present day vehicles, though now they are floating.The storyline is predictable, with some surprise twists, which didn't help to elevate the seasoned feeling of the movie.IMDb have always made me believe that ratings 8 and above are for breakthrough movies but now even mediocre movies are able to have same ratings.",Star Trek Into Darkness
982,tvrobertson,Unexpectedly Entertaining,10,23 September 2013,"I watch a lot of movies, and it's easy to get jaded. I remember hearing about this new Star Trek movie and then I just forgot about it - never even made it to my queue - just what we need, another Star Trek movie! Fortunately a friend invited me over to watch it in his excellent home theater, and I found my expectations exceeded at least once every five minutes. It reminded me of taking my kids to the first Star Wars movie. No fundamental novelty, but executed in way that was totally entertaining. Fast-paced plot, five-movies-worth of action scenes with terrific effects, and characters that engagingly moved the story forward while having a blast evoking the original Star Trek characters. What fun! I gather from the negative reviewers that for this movie I must have the right amount of Star Trek familiarity together with lack of attachment to its (or at least the reviewers') canons.

983,earthlingfire,Too much action. Too little story.,5,5 November 2013,"This is a non-stop action movie. It's the kind of movie where the action/CG scenes are so prevalent that the effectiveness of them, the affect, is nullified. One disaster leads into another after (very) short reprieves of story and dialogue and by the end the viewer is left numb.This kind of thing seems to be a trend with many movies these days. Movies are becoming more visual rides than stories and are mirroring the non-stop silliness and action found in many bad kids movies. I wanted to see Star Trek! It was in there somewhere; underneath all of the shiny glitter there was talk of the prime directive etc. Kirk is depicted more as a cowboy than a Starfleet captain. I found it very messy. There was almost no professionalism to be found in Starfleet other than Spock's dry, logical persona that us Star Trek fans know and love. I thought the actors did a fine job. If they were given a better, more interesting script I think that these new Star Trek movies could be strong. I don't feel that this crew of actors is getting a fair chance. I do like that these movies are made to appeal to the masses rather than just pure Star Trek fan, in that they are looser, less confined, and more youthful, but Star Trek is getting lost. I wonder what Gene Roddenberry would say.",Star Trek Into Darkness
984,maxpam44,Where did the big Starfleet vs Klingon-war go?,1,7 December 2013,"I've just 1 question for mister Abrams: what happened with the big all out war with the Klingons, the center of the plot with crazy Marcus? Did the Klingons suddenly forget all about that big shiny starfleet Enterprise lurking in their space, forget that starfleet attacked and killed several of their members at Kronos, and became budhistic?OK, another question: Was it the wish of the studio to show all the violence in a vanilla-way, no blood or other nastiness except some dark coloured spots on Pikes shirt? Was it too much to ask to add a bit more plausibility to Kirks severe radiation syndrome than his sweeaty face?I've one suggestion for you: ask the producers of The A-Team whether you can borrow their score to combine with whatever actionscenes you'll shoot in whatever new movies you make. It makes for us viewers a much more understandable experience.",Star Trek Into Darkness

The acting is amazing, the sets are incredible, and the villain casting was a really great choice. Bravo filmmakers. I loved the first film as well, don't get me wrong, but this one I especially liked. I am thinking that I especially liked it because of Cumberbach and his portrayal of Kahn. Plus, anything Zachary Quinto does is perfect in my book. I've only rented it twice, but hoping when I purchase the Blu Ray it has some great extras. I guess the only criticism (not that I have any right to criticize, that's for sure), would be to to perhaps have another main female character because the entire movie of men. But still, that's Hollywooooood I guess. It certainly didn't ruin the experience for me and I gave this movie the highest recommendation. Maybe 8 is too low, not sure. Either way, watch this film!

I actually bought this movie, and I am super glad I did. It is freaking awesome. I just loved it. But let me just say there is something really fishy going on here...How can this movie get a 7.9/10 stars on the IMDb If all I am reading here is mostly NEGATIVE reviews?It just does not make sense at all! This movie is HIGHLY Rated on all the other websites...like saaay ROTTEN TOMATOES! It is certified FRESH and 90% of the audience liked it and 87% of the critics liked it. It also did super well on Metacritic,....a solid 72/100 and the user score? a 7.8/10. So what the HECK is going on here ? this is the only website where I am reading mostly NEGATIVE reviews..everything else is positive ! Why is that ?In the first few pages of reviews..there is mostly negative reviews...same thing goes along somewhere in page 13 to 17 and same at page 24 to 27 but at page 34 or 35 or 36, the reviews got a little bit more positive. I just decided to stop there. Anyway, I give this movie a 77/100 and a 7.8/10 stars. The cast as usual is great. I just love the cast, and I love the new add on too. There is a NEW character and she is a cute blonde women! She made the movie more live as well, she was a great add on to all this. She is Alice Eve as Carol Marcus.Special Effect? GREAT! loved the guns...looks like the guns from star wars. My favorite scene is when the black ship crashed landed into London, and knocked down a lot of buildings. Boy, that scene is just amazing.

988,fading_review_nerd_01,Dark sci-fi adventure that delivers a non-stop thrill ride,5,30 September 2014,"Star Trek Into Darkness continues on some time after the events of the 2009 movie. The story is carried with quite dark tone of intrigue and betrayal as Kirk and his crew search for an elusive terrorist. The pace is super fast and very slick, taking me from one scene to the next with hardly room to think. These scenes are interspersed with frenetic fight and chase sequences that really put me right there at the centre of the action. There is also an array of gorgeous special effects, set visuals and soundtracks that effectively capture the mood of the scenes. Spock and Kirk are played well enough but don't really display great chemistry between them, despite the heavy drama that develops later in the film. The rest of the crew are pretty much redundant in their roles too in terms of dialogue and aren't really developed any further than they were in the 2009 film. They do their best but I don't feel much affection or warmth towards any of the characters.The premise of this film is quite exciting and I like the idea of how a society deals with an all-too-real threat against their way of life. The main antagonist, Khan, delivers a charismatic yet enigmatic turn as a hunted man with a shadowy past. The actor playing him injects a lot of energy into his role but isn't given the best dialogue to work with. In fact, a lot of the dialogue throughout the movie is often clunky, clumsy and forced. This is a shame as I think there is a lot of material in the narrative to bring out something more meaningful.Overall, Star Trek Into Darkness offers an atmospheric and ambitious spectacle but at the same time a soulless drama.",Star Trek Into Darkness

The one thing that bothered me about the 2009 re-boot was future Spock and yes he appears again for whatever reason in this film as well. The Original Wrath of Khan is probably the best of all the Star Trek films and they decided to rip it off and in a bad way with slight twists and differences although not creative ones. Kirk and Spock are friends and have respect for each other, they are not supposed to want to have sex with each other or something. The Positive: Zoey Salandana, if the movie is going to suck then let me see more of her at least. Conclusion: It was a mildly entertaining, box office budget, mind numbing experience.

Then into darkness came out, i asked 6 of my friends to go to watch the movie with me, none of them said yes(they didn't watch first JJ's star trek), all of them said no because they thought its the same like the old star trek!!

I did like how they threw in several Star Trek tributes...little sayings or cameos such as mentioning Nurse Chapel, Harry Mudd and even the Tribbles make an appearance. This does not give away too much but for hard core Star Trek fans you will catch those little snippets. The special effects were off the hook and again in 3D were even better.

When accepted in that realm...be prepared to just let loose and have fun. After all, we're talking about warp speed, worm holes in space that can take you into a different place and a different time. The thing is...There's something to be said about "" suspending dis-belief"" . Almost always, the Star Trek franchise gets a more forgiving grading curve, at least by me, and it should. It's the one place I can sit back and say "" Ahhhhh...hey...it's years in the future...why not!"". The problem however arises when ""Into Darkness"" does what so many science fiction and action movies all seem to do today.....absolute overkill on action scenes, special effects, and in some ways even the plot itself. Yes...even for Star Trek this time. Scotty is leaning over the rail pulling two people up that are subsequently holding on to each other ( human chain). Come onnnn! How about at the end when Spock was fighting Khan? Spock and Khan jumping with ease...from a moving vessel to another moving vessel a hundred feet below. It goes on and on and on. It's really really sad that the soul of movies has largely been substituted for more action and more special effects...which undoubtedly will affect the script. Not all with Into Darkness is bad. I do believe some thought and ""some heart"" was put into. I even had a ""little"" fun. Leonard Nemoy's final appearance as original Spock rocked. The scene was actually touching. I was able to keep in mind that their lives were changed forever in the previous movie allowing us to see the crew with brand new adventures. I am fine with that. Again, it's Star Trek. I would've been much happier if JJ Abrams would have left Khan's body parts floating back on City Alpha 5 (or how ever you say it..I'm a Trekki, but not the best one). There was enough here for me to get excited about another Trek.....but boy oh boy...Hollywood sure seems out of touch sometimes. Any other Hollywood movie that does these kind of critical errors wouldn't even get a ""1"". Seriously folks, its getting bad.

996,Talking_of_Michelangelo,Derivative plot elements make the stars themselves enter darkness...,1,12 May 2013,"***WARNING: SPOILERS*** Please note that this review does contain spoilers.I have been a fan of Star Trek since watching it as a child during the first run of the first season of The Original Series on Australian television (then in living black and white).I was so bitterly disappointed in Star Trek Into Darkness.My issue is the plot and writing.The acting, direction, cinematography and SFX were all of very high standards, however...However.Kirk has the Enterprise taken off him, demoted then put back in the chair - I saw little point in that other than to address the concerns about the rapidity with which Kirk was promoted to Captain in the earlier film by JJ Abrams. It seemed to be a back-peddling contrivance, and a little too convenient to accept.Later, when Benedict Cumberbatch reveals himself as being Khan I found myself bored. It was to me a non-event.It is not Benedict Cumberbatch's performance - I actually think he made a 'superior' Khan to his predecessor (although I found his pallid, northern European appearance to be seriously at odds with Khan's ethnicity - genetic superman or not, he did not 'look' the part of a despot from the Indian subcontinent).Rather, I felt that something was being rehashed. And it was. And Khan was not the only element being rehashed.The worst part of all to me was the rehashing of Spock's death from ST II: The Wrath of Khan, then the rehashing of his resurrection from ST III: The Search for Spock. The twist of it being Kirk, not Spock, on the lethal side of the glass, as his hand goes up in a vain attempt to reach through and make contact with his pointy-eared friend did not in my view make this recycling excusable. Kirk's resurrection in Into Darkness was very different in mechanical terms to Spock's seen in ST III, but I felt it to be as big a cop-out as its earlier incarnation.I have always felt that the resurrection of Spock in ST III was a shameful act of story-writing cowardice, and the fact that the same principle has been applied to resurrect Kirk (albeit in a different manner) is far worse this second time around, if only for its severe shortfall of imagination and originality.The, worst of all, when Kirk knocked out Scotty and entered the high radiation area to save the ship from certain doom, I actually started groaning - with disgust. I very nearly violated my longstanding principle of never walking out on a film. I had hoped the story would redeem itself. It did not.For those who never saw Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan nor Star Trek III: The Search for Spock, this fault will go unnoticed. If you have never seen ST II or ST III, then you have not seen the original source material from which so many important plot points have been plundered in order to make Star Trek Into Darkness.To cap it off, with his friend Kirk now dead, Spock repeats Kirk's line from ST II, screaming out: ""Khaaaaaaan!"" That line was so cheesy the first time around it has been the source of many a parody. The tragedy here is that what appears to have been intended as an emotional punch is simply pitiful.To me, Star Trek Into Darkness has taken the franchise into true darkness.I don't think I'll be able to drag myself along to see the next installment.And that saddens me.It is as if the stars themselves have entered a darkness from which they may never return.",Star Trek Into Darkness

Anyway, predictable plot twists even for a 10 year old, complete disregard for any sort of scientific fact (i know that is fiction, but that ""sci"" part comes from science - example when the ship is free falling towards the Earth the objects inside free fall along with the ship at the same speed, anyone who saw a image of an astronaut in the space station or was riding a roller coaster knows that) and not one moment to remember.(at least a joke or a clever line).Good luck with your new demographics ""Star Trek"", probably the same who gave ""sex and the city"" 9 out of 10.",Star Trek Into Darkness

999,angelinakontini,"Bad Actors, Bad Script, Bad Taste",1,5 February 2018,"First of all, it does not follow any of the real Star Trek principles. The ship does not look at all like a starfleet ship. The crew does not talk at all like a starfleet crew. Starfleet represented higher ideals and a formal way of managing a ship. The dialogues are so informal, thoughtless and none can believe that real starfleet officers would talk in such a manner. The first impression of Captain Kirk is that of a fearful, uneducated cadet. Leaders are born, not made and this Kirk does not sound like a leader. I am not sure what is worse, the script or the actors or both. The settings look highly technological, which is completely contrary to the fact that the setting of the original Star Trek was not so technologically advanced. They failed to create a believable timeline. Nothing inside the starship, reminds one of a starfleet starship. This vast inconsistency in style is not believable. The story itself has nothing unique, nothing intelligent, it is like a badly written episode of a 7 season series, but without any real plot. It's all action. Nothing on morality, nothing on exploration, it is just a continuous conflict and an attempt to escape unfortunate circumstances. Not even any brilliant strategical or tactical scenes. The worst thing about it, is how they tried to recreate the scene where Spock died in ""The Wrath of Khan"" with Kirk in his place. It was obvious that that scene was placed there as an attempt to somehow connect the old with the new Star Trek, totally failing as it came across tasteless, and without any sort of justification from the actual plot. They changed everything, only kept the name and some childish references to the older Star Trek. Disappointing.",Star Trek Into Darkness
1000,tacomaguy,Franchise Killer!,1,6 December 2018,"I hated this movie with a passion. It feel like its a bunch of millennial brats running around on spaceship half cocked and not thinking anything through. What I liked about Star Trek TOS was that Captain Kirk could outsmart his enemy and fight when needed. Now Star Trek has been dumbed down. It's all run, shoot, run more, get shot at, do a trick, get tips from the future (cheats from the future Spock). As long as there are special effects, nothing else matters I guess. Oh and don't worry, no actual crew members have an original thought. ""Oh you need the mathematical equation for transporting during warp, sure thing"" says future Spock. ""Anytime you guys are in a jam just call me up and I'll solve all your problems for you!"" Then the ending was horrible with the switch they did. God that irked me like no other. I watched this movie in the theater and it turned me off from watching the 3rd movie in this new franchise and I've watch all the TV shows:TOS, TNG, Deep Space 9, Voyager, etc as well as all the other movies. This movie ruined the franchise for me, that's how bad it is.",Star Trek Into Darkness

Instead, (re)rent Star Trek 2: Wrath of Khan. Abrams' re- imagining lacks any of the philosophical and ethical dilemmas of earlier Star Trek, or the clever battle of the wits between Kirk and his nemesis. Instead you have many characters who act in ways very different from the philosophy of Starfleet, unnecessarily (and poorly) re-imagined species like the Klingons, inexplicable plot points, excessive fight scenes, and way too many lens flares. Also, if you have seen Star Trek II: Wrath of Khan, you'll see things that are not an homage, but instead a true insult to Star Trek fans. The intriguing back story of the villain explored in earlier Trek is glossed over here resulting in a two dimensional baddie, despite Benedict Cumberbatch's otherwise excellent acting. If you're looking for an intellectually stimulating space adventure, look elsewhere. If you're looking for over the top action, eye numbing visual effects, and goose stepping-inspired uniforms, then it might be just what you're looking for.",Star Trek Into Darkness

So this movie had a tough up-hill battle ahead of it. I am happy to report that the writing, direction, cinematography and acting were all terrific. But it's not quite flawless. There are a couple of minor plot holes that distract viewer attention to some degree. Cumberbatch is brilliant. I won't divulge any spoilers, but I will say that the throw back to the earlier movies is very very clever and well executed.

1003,brianseto,Eh,3,20 May 2013,"I want to qualify my review by saying that I'm an old-school Trek fan. I also want to say that I didn't like the 2009 Abrams ""Star Trek"" movie very much, although I didn't absolutely hate it.They managed to make the franchise even dumber and more ADD than the 2009 Trek movie.Lots of action, pretty actors and actresses, and cool special effects. Those were the only real redeeming qualities of this movie.Story and character motivation were severely lacking. A brief cameo appearance by an old-school Trek character is used to further the plot in the least subtle way; the character bonks the audience over the head with information about the antagonist, rather than the script leading us to the information.Benedict Cumberbatch was severely underutilized as an actor. There was only one marginally good scene between Kirk and Cumberbatch's character in which he explains his motivations. Otherwise, the character was one-dimensional and was going through the action-packed motions from that point on with requisite snarling.Overall, I hope J.J. Abrams gives up the Star Trek franchise when he makes the new Star Wars movie. He's taken all of the thinking out of Star Trek. While old Trek was never hardcore sci-fi, and sometimes was kinda cheesy, at least it had elements of politics, religion, and social issues.",Star Trek Into Darkness
1004,okerry-1,Cashing in on a cheap rip-off,2,20 September 2013,"This film is an attempt to cash in on the Star Trek name with poorly done stories that don't take one-tenth of the effort that the original stories took. The producers are making the very, very big mistake of thinking that you can slap the Star Trek label on any kind of crap and people will still spend lots of bucks to see it and make you very rich.Don't count on it.Calling it a ""reboot"" is an insult to the fans who have supported this series for so long and would love to see more well-done, intelligent stories about these characters and the positive, hope-filled future they live in.To Paramount and Mr. J. J. Abrams: Either do Star Trek stories that are true to the characters and philosophy that made it a hit in the first place, or just create your own original series and do whatever kind of blow-stuff-up movie you want. You can't do both and you are only alienating fans everywhere by trying to do both.I gave this a 2 instead of a 1 only because the actors are trying their very best to recapture some beloved characters, but even they can't overcome a rotten script written by people who care nothing about those same characters.What a waste.

Yes, the action scenes are exciting, but what really makes this film great is the emotional depth of the characters and their interactions. For those of you who are wary of seeing this film because it may not be exactly like previous episodes or films, I argue that you give it a chance. Yes, the stories are different, but our protagonists are the characters that we have come to know and love over the years.

She is a ride or die kind of girl and won't back down.I wish they would have brought back sarek because he had a big presence in the tos movies although shown briefly in each one.

Star trek into darkness is like an effort to finish off a movie so that J.J Abraham could get up to go do what he really intended to do in the first place. Impress the likes of George Lucas into making his next film.The film -without revealing any spoilers- sticks to the age old formula of just portraying the bro-mance between Kirk and Spock without much loyalty to the grand Universe that Gene Roddenberry set to create. If you are a hardcore fan of Star Trek - The next generation universe and yet like the characters that the first series had, then you will not be disappointed. This film is an out and out action movie with a fast-paced screenplay which will not bore you. The dialogues I would not say the same about, as much needs to be refined to get the whole team chemistry to be like-able and praiseworthy.That being said the film continues the parallel universe that the first (2009) film created and ends up just rehashing the old plot with alternate characters facing the same obstacles, villains and life choices that the earlier adaptation went through.

1011,wifi13,Major Science Fiction Contender,10,17 May 2013,"There seems to be a lot of sour grapes going on still from original Trekkie's, when if pondered in the light of what alternative sci-fi films we've been given in the past few years (e.g., Prometheus was a miserably written mess), this latest Star Trek version rides high with intense entertainment value in contrast to so much sci-fi genre mediocrity. There's nothing really to complain about as a stand-alone film; therein lies the conundrum. Fans of the original Trek universe are still in a tizzy over what the new canon writers are perpetrating on them. Understandable, I'm a huge original Trek fan; I've spent most of my existence trying to emulate that universe here on this devolved planet of xenophobes. For me, when a film moves me to tears 3 separate times, then I have to take notice of how it all fits together, regardless of how other Trek films have played out. Doctor Who doesn't resemble much from its predecessor either, but it's such a brilliantly produced and written show that original fans no longer stress over continuity and canon. But then again, Star Trek and its fans are a very unique breed of critical and over-analyzing nerds. Further, there is nothing lazy about bringing an original character back (Cumberbatch's exquisitely acted performance as Khan), especially when the storyline is completely fresh & updated. 10/10 for superb acting, stunning visuals, and genuine ecstatic entertainment.",Star Trek Into Darkness
1012,akeelthefirst,"Just another action movie, not the Star Trek I know and love",6,6 July 2013,"I consider myself a bit of a trekkie. Not one that speaks Klingon or Vulcan, but one who loves the show (original and new generation), and has watched most of the movies. In fact, only this morning I watched an episode of new generation to accompany my breakfast. And I was thrilled to finally find the time to watch this movie later in the day, especially since it's garnered such favourable reviews. Turns out, of the two, I immensely preferred today's show to today's movie.In ascending order, here are my reasons:3. Spock's portrayal as being the constant nag, who is constantly ignored by kid Kirk. Whatever happened to the great chemistry shared between these characters, and Spock being Kirk's most trusted aide. Sure the movie shows that they're willing to risk all for each other, but it completely fails to show why. Spock for me comes across as more of a machine, with no real wisdom, and his triumph over Khan is only achieved after receiving much needed advice from his older, better and future self. And when he does show emotion after Kirk's death, its a bit too much, especially when he goes ballistic (aka Kirklike) on Khan. And Kirk, instead of having grown and matured since the 1st movie, seems to have regressed into a bar fighter. The Kirk I know might have broken all rules to save his best friend, but he wouldn't lie about it later.2. Why the reinvention of an old Star Trek movie? There is so much new ground that can be explored. Is Hollywood so completely out of ideas? And when you re-do key scenes (of course I'm referring to the radiation room death), its sweet in a way because its a little tribute to the original. But you know what, given this is a Star Trek movie, you don't need to provide tributes in this form. The fact that you're making a Star Trek movie, with the same characters as Gene Rodenberry's creation, is enough of a tribute. Simple fact is, if I wanted to watch Wrath of Khan, I'd go to NetFlix. But when I go to the movie cinema to watch a new Star Trek movie, I'd like to see a new Star Trek movie.1. Star Trek isn't just about action set in space. Nor is it just about humans betraying and killing other humans. Star Trek is about cultural and scientific exploration. The fact that the sole premise of this movie is just about a manhunt (even Wrath of Khan had the important side story about the Genesis project), and war mongering between the federation and the Klingon empire makes this feel not like a Star Trek movie, but just any other summer action blockbuster. Which isn't what I at least wanted.So all in all....if you just want an entertaining action movie, go see this movie.

Some of the other characters are caricatures, really why do all heads of engineering have a lousy accent? You got a ships doctor going out on very hazardous patrols instead of someone with fighting or survival skills. Both the ships captain and the first officer taking of for whatever they feel like without showing an ounce of responsibility for their ship or the people on it. And then the plot....

The latter stems from a tasteless joke about toilet paper) and I don't go around with that dorky hand gesture wishing others to live long and prosper.Seriously, this movie is a blast from start to finish. Pine, Quinto and everyone else in the cast are thoroughly convincing in their roles, worthy replacements in an alternate universe. Sure there are plot holes, but like Kirk said in this film, ""Big Deal!"". It might also be worth recalling that the original series, TNG, and all the movies all had plot holes. In many ways, that's kind of what makes Star Trek, in all its incarnations, so much fun. As soon as I saw the Enterprise on the bottom of the ocean, I knew IMDb would be full of howls of indignation about this movie and I was right. And I don't care. I do not want to imagine what it might be like to sit through a movie in the company such detractors because all it would do would be to ruin the tremendous amount of entertainment that this film offers.As for the complaints about the Spock/Kirk switcheroo, I thought it was brilliant. If you cannot see why this was well done in the context of an alternate universe then you are not the Star Trek fan you claim to be. Oh, and did I mention it's in 3D.

Abrams was a delight to watch and literally amazed me by how greatly he has re-introduced the same old characters to the new generation.After witnessing such a reboot I have been waiting for the next chapter ever since and finally came Star Trek Into Darkness.From the very first scene JJ sets the pace and missing a scene means missing a reference to the old Trek movies either through the various catch phrases or through the sets.Reliving those moments in a somewhat familiar yet different setting is an experience of its own The movie takes off where the previous one left us i.e. the bonding between Kirk and Spock which is developed into a friendship in this movie.Attention has been given to the development of all other characters may it be Scotty, Bones,Uhura or Sulu.Benedict(a.k.a Sherlock) has underplayed his part perfectly and as always is a treat to watch. Leonard Nimoy: his presence made me add another star to the rating. He is a legend.There has always been a silliness quotient attached to all the old Star Trek movies, despite being set in future, which saves the movies from becoming too complicated and restricting the viewers to be a lover of a particular genre and this movie stays true to it.It is no where near perfect and have countless flaws but then again it is made for humans so it is not logic that always comes first it is the heart and this movie has plenty of it.P.S.

I don't have an inclination to write reviews, but as a Star Trek fan since I was just a kid force me to give my opinion.This is my take why this movie sucks: Spock acting like a raging maniac compared to a real Vulcan?? They had to place the device manually into the volcano? Don't they already have the technology to jut drop a device into the volcano and let it do the work? If they can use shuttles and the transport beam why the hell they have to go into the atmosphere... and not happy enough, to put the entire ship under water? Why don't just keep where it belongs, in orbit? Why Khan kept his fellow shipmates frozen? Why just revive them all and take the hole world? The Klingon race is much stronger than humans, maybe more stronger and capable in war and fight than any other race, even compared to Khan. But in this movie they drop like fly (not forgetting the war machines destroyed by a had gun, a big gun indeed, but still a hand gun.Kirk dies?? Ho, they have a miraculous healing blood that even cure the dead, and everybody seems not to noticed before? Carol showing her hot body?? Hmm, OK...The interior of enterprise seems to be a big hole of lose pipes and big machinery just laying around waiting to go flying around destroying other stuffs...The enterprise is not a war vessel... Where did those nuclear-submarine-like torpedo hatches, along the hole ship, came from?? And at the end, a super giant bad ass enterprise-like ship crash into the city, killing maybe hundreds of thousands citizens in the ground and into the buildings, and they make a ceremony to one dead man?

There were also at least four or five events, in different settings, repeated from the film prior. It makes me wary of the next film running out of steam halfway into it.Pros. The character interactions are solid. It doesn't fall short of basic standards you'd expect. The darkness in men is also shown and more of the scenes are shot with grey and darker colours tipping a hat to the title. All of the main crew members each get to do one or two things that were outside of the 1-D roles the last film had them in.Conclusion. Most will like this, you may love it, but you won't be in love with it. It's better than most releases this year so far but it's in the friend-zone.Email comments are welcome.",Star Trek Into Darkness
1023,dmarley-1,Not for the die hard Trekkies,5,13 September 2013,"JJ Abrams knows how to deliver action, this movie is packed with it. I think he would have done such a better job with star trek if he would have not used original characters. Trying to replace the original cast was bad enough (with the exception of Carl Urban).....Then he committed the ultimate sin, how can you even attempt to cast anyone other then Ricardo Montalban as Khan. Abrams has chosen to go with this ""altered universe"" theme- you know, the one that does not include Kirks older brother Sam. He should tell his buddy Damon Lindelof to watch the original Star Trek. We know that Lindelof is good at copying other peoples work, He owes his writing career to Art Bell, George Noory and some of the guests that they have had on their radio show- Coast to Coast AM. All one has to do is watch Lost or Prometheus to make that deduction.",Star Trek Into Darkness
1024,brezanac,A well deserved 1/10 movie,1,21 May 2013,"Easily the worst film I've seen in years not to mention the worst (Star Trek?) movie ever. I've been a Star Trek fan for over 25 years and seeing how a Hollywood hotshot-director destroys absolutely everything he touches was especially painful for me in case of Star Trek.Nevertheless I approached watching this movie with clean slates. That didn't help - the movie is an absolute insult to Star Trek. I could now go over all the stuff that simply didn't feel right but really, why bother? The story was absolutely hideous and full of plot holes which could be easily spotted by a two year old. Some of the characters were simply put in the movie to appeal to older Star Trek fans but in this reboot they are so shallow and distracting that it hurts. The character that really showed potential was the one played by Cumberbatch because for a couple of minutes I really though his rendition of a famous villain could be so good. I was wrong. He was simply wasted in favor of some brainless action and as a result of, yet another, plot hole.However the most insulting thing in the whole movie had to be the scene at the end which was simply a recreation of the famous death scene from the original ""Wrath of Khan"" yet with reversed roles. It just showed how lacking the whole idea of rebooting Star Trek was because on one side it insists that it was a separate timeline and everything can happen but on the other side it shows that the best it can come up with is a refined idea from the originals.To conclude this short review. My 1/10 score is not affected by any kind of rant or feeling that I need to rate the movie so low just to counter all the high scores. No. It is my honest opinion deeply influenced by so many flaws and scenes that any honest Trekkie would deem insulting.",Star Trek Into Darkness
1025,heatherdeutsch,Star Trek Into Darkness 2013,3,30 May 2015,"I love all the Star Trek movies - even the not so good ones. The problem with this movie is J.J. Abrams. He has made 'Star Trek Into Darkness' too much like a Star Wars movie - way too much technology and special effects and not nearly enough character development. It was always the character development that made us care about the characters of Star Trek - not the flashy technology and special effects. J.J. Abrams may be great at Star Wars but he is turning Star Trek into a non-stop action movie which is Star Wars - not Star Trek. Abrams needs to either review what made Star Trek, Star Trek Next Generation, Star Trek Voyager, and previous Star Trek movies so loved - or Star Trek needs a different director.",Star Trek Into Darkness
1026,UnboundDarkness,"Stunning effects, pays tribute to the original",8,11 May 2013,"Where to begin? The easiest part: the effects are awesome (although the 3D leaves a lot to desire). Nice explosions and flashy lights.Also, it pays tribute to the original by developing the personalities of the characters to something that actually resembles ST:TOS. But then you also have some things that do not quite fit, because after all this is a reboot and not a remake (I will not forget that Vulcan is non-existent in this version). So, there are some awesome elements that made me say ""This, THIS is Star Trek"", followed by ""Damn, I have to take that back"", then again ""THIS is it... no, not THAT... YES... NO"".Mixed feelings, but left with an awesome experience. Many fans of the entire saga will disagree with me on this one, but for me THIS is Star Trek (a little more flashy and shallow).",Star Trek Into Darkness

Will it please TrekKERS(fans of ""The Next Generation"") and their laughable longing for ""cerebral"" story lines fit for sleep-inducing television but not for a big screen blockbuster? No. If 7 wooden crew members spending 25% of a film sitting around a table trying desperately to sound intelligent is your cup of tea...don't bother seeing this film. If you simply want to be entertained by a cast and crew you can actual cheer for and laugh at...this is your film. If you want a wooden crew with no clue as to what a sense of humor is...this is NOT your film. This is Star Trek TOS and although the body of this story arc is serious, it's not without its funny bone. While Karl Urban still hams it up a tad bit as Dr. McCoy, the rest of the cast do their job well in their respective roles. As for the film's antagonist, I have to admit there is a lack of ""gravitas""...but only for longtime Trekkies who can't get the original actor out of our heads. This is the trap of bringing back a character from the original series. I suppose a newbie Trekkie could care less but overall the plot and most importantly, the PACING is vastly improved over the '09 film.",Star Trek Into Darkness
1029,thetampapirate,Excellent and well worth watching!! Roddenberry would be proud.,9,25 August 2013,For those who want the same story retold over and over it's a shame they can't see the brilliance JJ Abrams brings to the franchise. I think it was an excellent story and I love the twist! I think those who can't get out of the past to see the good qualities of this movie are foolish and sad. They are missing the whole idea that the stories will have new endings because the time line was changed thanks to Nero. The only thing I would have a slight issue with was continuity was lacking in some areas. The special effects are stunning and the soundtrack was equally stunning. I enjoy that Abrams understands the Naval shipboard terminology and protocols. Outside of that it's an excellent movie and worth the watch!!,Star Trek Into Darkness

This is simply an action movie, that happens to have phasers instead of guns, and beaming instead of taking a plane/car. I was expecting to see some science and understanding, instead I got the 1970s captain again, with the fist fighting enemies and kissing the girls. What happened to the optimistic bright future where money is not an issue and people work to better themselves? What happened to the Earth that was heaven? What happened to the engineers who make improvements to the ship using alien technologies, and not try to fix it all the time? What happened to technological competition and diversification? Where is the strategy? Smart ship tactics? All seems to be brute force in this movie. As a trekkie, I am quite disappointed.",Star Trek Into Darkness

A reboot means fresh ideas in a movie, not a recycled pastiche of earlier stories and dumb action flick. To say it was written by monkeys insults monkeys and implies it was actually written. Waste of money unless you want to see escapism without any brains involved. I don't hate action movies with a blatant disregard for physics, but some consistency is asked for. But makes whooshes in a vacuum for drama is one thing. What is apparently a dead stop somewhere near the moon all of a sudden is a free fall descent like a rock dropped over SF isn't credible to a 2 year old child and a waste of my money.

1034,fay-vincent,Disappointing when there was so much possibility...,7,8 May 2013,"(no spoilers)OK, well I was a big fan of J.J. Abrams first reboot of the Star Trek brand and have been looking forward to this installment for a long time. I'll admit that one of the things which I liked most about the first film was the nostalgia, casting decisions and new time line plot which left this movie open to any possibility. In fact that's mostly what I was hoping for with this one - a new direction. We got the background/reintroduction of the characters last time so perfect to start pushing the boundaries. The first half an hour or so didn't disappoint, visually great although I'm not sure the 3D was necessarily needed, feeling like an afterthought, which in fact it was (shot in 2D and converted in post production). As the plot starts to develop it feels interesting and I started to hope that my expectations were going to materialise. HOWEVER...Don't get me wrong I understand the die hard Trekkies want the references to the past films/series but sometimes it felt forced like certain characters (Scottie, Bones) were turning into caricatures of themselves and the dialogue/banter certainly wasn't as good as the first installment in my opinion. Sentimental scenes were just TOO sentimental and the Leonard Nimoy appearance superfluous. If action is your thing you won't be disappointed and Benedict Cumberbatch is an AWESOME movie villain I'll give him that.Anyone new to ST just won't understand the relevance of some of the plot, any old timers like myself might be disappointed with the lack of imagination when they had so much there to work with. All in all 7/10",Star Trek Into Darkness
1035,tommo385,Great film that stays true to the Star Trek faithful.,9,16 May 2013,"So, I treated myself to a night out, on my own, at the IMAX for a bit of Trek. Granted in 1966 when Shatner first eyebrowed his way to the forefront my father was 14 and I was 20 years from conception. I am no uber Trekkie but I did grow up watching reruns and know the series well. I was prompted to write a review by mutterings I heard from a young whipper snapper (i'm an aging 26) as I left the screen on Wednesday night. He said ""The overacting was ridiculous."" I would echo this sentiment in the most positive way possible. In every way the overacting was ridiculously true to the original cast.The film itself was great. From the special effects filled beginning (reminiscent of Insurrection) the plot jumps straight in. The side plot, difficult relationship bit, as in the 2009 reboot, is between Kirk and Spock. This is very well done, appropriately cheesy at times. Quinto does a great job of showing an emotionally immature Spock and gives a great performance all round. Pine seems to have settled in to his role much more this time around. Maybe not quite getting the inappropriate pauses in all the wrong places but that will come. With time. The plot continues to unfold at great pace giving us our villain Khan. Cumberbatch is menacing, scary and cold with his reptilian stare, truly making the role his. I think even the most faithful will agree that his performance is brilliant. At no point does he seem 'just like Sherlock' which is an achievement in itself. He portrays emotion with apparent ease and bring a new interesting Khan angle to the Trek canon. The action continues relentlessly throughout the film. Although at no point does this feel inappropriate it is great when the action slows. It is worth a note that the film clearly benefits from not having to re- introduce all the characters and relationships. The IMAX screen did the SFX great justice with the 3D truly complementing the fast paced action. I do still find 3D motion blur a tad distracting and feel this sort of Abrams SFX bomb will really benefit when technology catches up with this issue. The film finishes with a long and epic climax. The 'dragged along' girlfriend on my right (not mine I might add) clearly amused by my involuntary fist pumps but am I bothered? no. well a little.The show stealing performances were without a doubt, Quinto's Spock and Cumberbatch's Khan. However that should not take away from the rest of the cast who were not overshadowed by these performances. Urban was great as Bones. Very true to the original in standing up to Kirk at times and talking in riddles. I have heard criticism of Pegg's Scotty from a number of people. I am going to respectfully disagree. He puts his own spin on the character slightly more than the rest of the cast but not to any detriment. I am yet to understand the problem with employing a Scot to play a Scot but it is a theme. One smaller role worth a mention is John Cho as Sulu. I love this guy. Mainly because whenever I see him I remember watching him shout milf at a portrait over ten years ago. He plays a young Sulu wonderfully. At times his character balking but then rising to responsibility handed to him. The fact I have gone over some of my favorite performances here should not take away from the great show given by the rest of the cast. Bruce Greenwood continues as the father figure that our new, alternate reality Kirk never had. Zoe Saldana plays on as the Uhura that Spock always dreaded about and Anton Yelchin is a hilarious as the nervous but very competent Chekov. Where the first film was introducing characters and explaining alternate realities, this film is pure action and plot. Very enjoyable and a great addition to the Star Trek canon. Rodenberry would be proud.",Star Trek Into Darkness

1037,boofoo-42-900816,Another disappointment,5,20 June 2013,"Another typical star trek movie. Great special effects; not always the most realistic, but as with the rest of the movie industry, it's getting better. Star Trek has always had weak plots, which become predictable half way through the movie. This is no different.The biggest disappointment is the weak story. I absolutely hate movies where you as the viewer are smarter than the characters. SPOILER! the last 20 minutes is about trying to capture Khan because only his blood can keep Kirk alive. OMG!!! Only Khans Blood??? He was one of 73 super humans. He was on the run (kill him if you can!) Where were the other 72 super humans? Comatose in a bunch of torpedo tubes 2 feet away. You can't get any blood from them?!?!?! Why is Khan's blood better than a bunch of sleeping prisoners who can't even say 'no' let alone fight to not get their blood drawn.After that the movie became a big fat ZERO. I only give it a 5 because of the first hour. Unfortunately the Star Trek movies have mostly been let downs. Only two movies out of the numerous made are even work seeing again. The Wrath of Khan (best Star Trek movie ever, by a long shot) and The Voyage Home (because of the humor). Other than that snore....",Star Trek Into Darkness
1038,igasu,"Great Fun, Or Empty and Shallow? (Minor Spoilers)",9,19 May 2013,"First I would like to say I probably liked Star Trek Into Darkness more than J.J Abrams Star Trek. But people also seem to see a lot of negatives in this latest movie. Make no mistake, Into Darkness is a fun, energetic movie with a lot of call backs to previous continuity. All the actors do their job well and Cumberbatch absolutely kills it as ""John Harrison"".Of all the secrets in the movie the John Harrison one was not a big secret. The Big secret in the movie is Peter Weller. He plays a much bigger role in the film and it was great. But this is where I think the film misses its mark. See, Star Trek at its heart has always been a smart piece that is able to make a point about the world we live in today. Or its able to make a statement about how we as society can be better.With this though we only scratch the surface. Weller's character sees a war coming with the Klingon. And he aims to start it so he can stop it. Sadly this thread is only in service of the twist in the movie. It is as if the subplot was created just to make every turn in the movie happen. But if time was spent on making the Klingons more of a character, gave them more of a role than background noise I think the movie would have been better off and all that stuff with John Harrison could have been saved for a sequel, which we will probably end up revisiting anyway.In the end, I think all the twist and left turns work, the movie is fun and fast pace and even the small amount of weight this movie acts like it wants to have works as it does not get to bogged down by what it wants to do. I do think if the story was told from the view point of the Admiral, Peter Weller's character it would have been a more interesting movie.",Star Trek Into Darkness
1039,sanjay-mayar,Wham-Bam action with Star Trek window-dressing,6,10 June 2013,"One of the worst Star Trek films ever. Yes, this includes ST5 and Nemesis. Bigger plot holes than Montreal potholes, non-stop action that really wasn't necessary and zero natural character development.A summary of my issues with this train-wreck:1) When McCoy realizes that Khan's blood can save Kirk, why does he frantically try to get it from Khan? Why not get the same genetically- enhanced blood from one of the 72 bodies in his sickbay??2) Why did Khan hide his 72-member crew in torpedoes? He said he did it for protection but that makes no sense. Why would you protect what's most precious to you in something designed to explode? Would you hide your baby on a nuclear bomb??3) There's gotta be better ways to start war with the Klingons than a scheme to a) Randomly search for things in the universe to help you build a super- ship and stumble across a 300-yr old frozen warlord b) Train that warlord to build you a ship and weapons c) Have him invent threats like bombing Section 31, killing a bunch of senior staff and then beaming 20 light-yrs to Qo-nos so you can bomb the heck out of an abandoned outpost4) If you can beam 20 light-years, beam the freaking 72 torpedoes there so Khan goes boom!5) When did Kirk turn into such an idiot? He's supposed to be a genius (says Admiral Pike in first ST reboot) but he makes the worst mistakes ever. a) Steals a sacred scroll from a native planet b) Sends Spock - his MVP - into a volcano that easily destroys a shuttle (which they leave on the planet) c) Brings 72 torpedoes aboard la-ti-DA despite everyone telling him he's an idiot d) Wants to start shooting at Klingons in his rink-a-dink ship and phasers e) Gets involved in a lover's quarrel with Uhura and Spock f) Speaking off, how come he doesn't' tell Uhura to zip it? She's constantly insubordinate and rude, leaves her post all the time - WTF?!6) Why doesn't Khan simply revive his crew? He was revived easily - and someone who can design star-ships/weapons with a 300-yr old handicap should be easily able to revive his crew. Especially if he can beam them into torpedoes! Why not beam them into a hot tub??Moreover, there's non-stop action that is gratuitous with zero Star Trek values (except uttered by alien Spock and an old-man Admiral who dies). No natural character development at all - Kirk saves Spock's life and all of a sudden they're best friends? Uhura just bitches the whole trip, McCoy is an old man who whines/worries, Kirk wants to shoot everything, and Spock grows by kicking the tar out of Khan and then crying??I don't understand why this movie is getting such rave reviews. It's bang-bang shoot-em-up in Star Trek window dressing - remove Enterprise and character names, and this film works by itself without any ST elements. As a Sci-Fi action film it's 7/10 at best and as ST it's 5/10.OK - the Spock/Khan scene was amazing. Great fight.",Star Trek Into Darkness

Benedict Cumberbatch seemed much more suitable for a villain; well acted character... Also the return of the Old Spock was a good touch. Liked the characters and the accents of the character played by Simon Pegg and the one that has a heavy Russian accent. This review is supposed to be at least 10 lines. Graphics-wise the movie meets the expectations. The first one was also a groundbreaking movie in terms of graphics.

The movie is, at best, a parody of the original Star Trek. It's full of clichés and try hard characters pretending they're the original heroes with every second sentence. The acting is awkward and childish, the story is boring and predictable, the effects are cheap and unrealistic and the soundtrack is a comedy. I almost walked out of the cinema on three separate occasions. The only emotion you will feel is a regret of the time wasted watching this.

I knew I didn't make a mistake just in the second when the movie begin. It was epic from the start, and for me, this movie had them all : Action, Great Effects, Sadness, Tears, Humor, Friendship, and moreover, It's quite a bloodless movie among their genres. Even the bad guy didn't end like what I expected, and It didn't disappoint me at all. This movie secretly taught me that there's always forgiveness for any mistakes. I don't know what exactly happen between Khan and The Enterprise, is he really that evil or as my inner said that he's just a pitiable guy. But at last, I was so satisfied with this movie. And I said this movie was not racist at all. Even each person use a different dialect, but I saw them as the director just wanted to show us how diverse our world'language are, there's so much unique languages and dialects besides English.

YES, THIS IS CONSIDERING GRAPHICS/3D, ACTING, FIGHTING AND REFERENCES OF THE ORIGINAL.(Minimum spoilers)Beginning kind of cheesy with the arrows. Light speed sparkles... eh. Khan's plan: not really a plan until Marcus comes. Carol Marcus: could have been better portrayed as the amazing scientist she is.Great references to Wrath of Khan with the KHAAAN yell, and the radiation. The 3D was amazing after the promotion to 2nd. Great acting by every one and especially by Pine, Quinto and Cumberbatch. Enjoyed the new Spock and Khan greatly!!!I did not mind the falling from orbit thing as much as I thought I would. S So many great moments! Acted like a kid and kept rocking the chair almost every 20 minutes!!!!Still pretty hyper.You can tell I enjoyed it. Haven't enjoyed anything like this since Dark Knight!It was nice of Abrams to not blind us with flares as much as the previous. And the flares actually ADDED to the movie in some conversations like between Kirk and Khan in Sickbay. Something to fill in the corner. Enjoyed that every main character got to have an impact and not one took the scene or even the movie. Mostly evenly matched or as much as you would expect to see them. Liked that they didn't overuse the ""Needs of the many..."" line, like in several of the movies.Big production movies usually have a few scenes that are just there to fill gaps while in shorter films every scene counts.To me every scene counted for something. Whether it be for nudity or explosions. There was very little I did not like and I can't remember them already. Which is probably due to there were better moments almost right after. Like everyone has said before, you do not have to have watched the Star Trek series or even the previous movie to enjoy this. But you have to admit, its a better experience!At the end, the way it ended with Kirks speech tying in with the Final Frontier line was very nice!In response to the ""purists"". I started reading reviews on IMDb and was not impressed. The Star Trek ""purists"" do not realize that this is a MOVIE and Movies do not have the same principles as Shows. Shows can go more in dept while there is a time constraint and trying to keep it interesting for 2 hours. The older movies were great for their time but even in them there was as little EXPLORING as there is in this. It is just that now the Special Effects are more widely used because they have become better. The camaraderie between the characters, the moments between Spock and Kirk. The development of Spock's human side. The relation between the original and newer changed actors. It was all remarkable. There was enough character development everywhere and even utilizing side characters was a good thing!Do not believe haters, they do not appreciate the revival of a legend and just name meaningless faults that are explained because of the alternate time line. Yes the beginning made no sense but beginning of movies and Star Trek movies have usually been just 'cool'. This is a great film, make your own opinions and share them! Everyone has an opinion but some of the reviews on here are preferences. Like how I would have preferred if in some moments there was a longer pause just for the feeling to sink in, because I did get a little emotional. Is that a bad thing? No, its just not many movies have enough character development that it makes you care for them. Only GREAT movies have this.As a Trekkie from Star Trek generation said to me today ""It's great that the new generation gets to enjoy the greatness of Star Trek.""",Star Trek Into Darkness

It was more than just the characters or what happened from week to week. What Abram's has done is take the idea of Star Trek and made it new and re-energized my dream of going into space. With his movies I am able to go.",Star Trek Into Darkness
1048,tommyinglis-203-847476,Could have been so great.,10,12 May 2013,"OK, before I get to it, I need to stress that this is not a bad film. I gave it a 7, meaning that I did enjoy it - but it could have been a 10. I'm not a die hard Trekkie, I have seen every movie and some episodes, but I don't know everything on it. That being said, I do feel let down by this film, even if my connection is not as strong as some peoples, so much so that I have taken to IMDb to discuss my anger.First, the things I liked. I need to stress, the majority of this film was amazing, visually and story wise. It was only up until the last ten minutes that the smile left my face and I felt as if I was watching this perfectly constructed film be blown up. I really liked the acting, especially Zachary Quinto who should seriously be up for awards. I also quite like some of the throw backs, from Chekov's worried face after he's told to put a red shirt on to the big reveal that Khan is in fact the villain (which we all called 5 months ago, but doesn't particularly bother me). The movie on a whole, until the end, was strong; and everything seemed great.Until the film sort of cheated. Now, when they killed (Spoilers) Kirk, I thought it was beautiful. That's the only word. The mirror of Wrath of Khan and the great acting made it so that fans were touched, but so were newcomers. That's what this film did, it made Star Trek enjoyable to everyone. Until they brought Kirk back. I mean, c'mon. What was the point of this film? It had a purpose, up until they tipexed over the emotional growth for the sake of a happy ending. Did we really need that? Before I entered the cinema, there was a trailer for Fast and Furious 6. Me and my mother (she is a die hard fan) were sitting and joked about how a film series can have so many movies without anything changing. Driving home she sat in silence, and I know why. Star Trek has become a Hollywood franchise. Nothing was learned in this film. The ending was exactly, shot for shot, the same as Star Trek (2009). this should not have been titled Star Trek Into Darkness, but rather Star Trek Into Lightly Shaded Rendering That We'll Erase So We Can Make Sequels, or LSRTWESWCMS for short. I feel as if Abrams could have done something special with this film, revolutionary even. Now I think he's just in it for the money. Anyway, as I said, I really enjoyed this film. If they has left it, ended it 20 minutes earlier, it would be a 9/10. However, someone thought they'd be clever, and failed - disappointing me and undoubtedly others.",Star Trek Into Darkness

Fool me twice, shame on me.",1,19 May 2013,"Paramount Pictures, director JJ Abrams and writers, Orci, Lindelof, and Kurtzman have once again proved that they figure Trekkies will go see anything as long as it's got the name ""Star Trek"" on it. If you set out to write a prequel to an existing work, then there can be nothing in the prequel which prevents the original from happening. It's simple, logical, cause-and-effect. Yet the 2009 movie contained story elements which effectively precluded at least one of my favorite episodes of TOS, ""Journey to Babel"". I'd hoped they'd learned how to write by now, but ""Into Darkness"" creates new paradoxes that mean that several other episodes cannot now occur (and more than just one particular episode, and its movie sequel, which have been mentioned in several other reviews). The claim that Abrams' version of Star Trek represents an ""alternate universe"" is nothing but a cheap cop-out explanation, made up after the fact, in an attempt to excuse extremely sloppy writing. ""Alternate universe""? Well, maybe there's an alternate universe ""me"" who'll go see the next Star Trek movie.

The emotion between Spock and Kirk, it moved me. I did cried a bit (well, I can't tell what scenes that make me cry). The acting, Benedict Cumberbatch being a villain so great. I love his gesture, mimic, voice, I can felt the angry. Well, If u are a cumberbitches, u re definitely watch this movie. Quite different with Sherlock of course.

1051,Jjbbmm,The plot went into darkness,3,29 June 2013,"*spoiler alert* So had Spock been on board the Enterprise and Kirk inside the volcano, he would have been okay to let Kirk die without beating someone up afterwards (because he himself is the only one who gets to decide?). Now Kirk made the decision to sacrifice himself to save the ship, and Spock went crazy beating Khan? This time he did not even try to curtail his emotions. Does his own entire planet, his mother included, not add up to Kirk?What kind of message are we sending to the world? -- This is after all an American movie, isn't it? -- That even the most rational of us could and should use violence at times?I like the first half of the movie; the character of Khan was building up nicely. He could have been told about the survival of his crew and shown his last path and it would have revealed more emotional depth of him. What a waste of character in the end. The movie jumped the shark the moment Kirk began climbing the nuclear core, and it went into the darkness as Spock lost it.

1052,jessica_yan1978,Best Science Fi in years,10,25 May 2013,"I haven't really been a big fan of Star Trek, technical not seen single episode, 2009 reboot completely blew me away, I loved the way J.J tells the story, in 2 hours ,explained brief background, it didn't take that long to bring me up to speed, at least to be able to enjoy the movie. Waited for 4 loooooong years (Seriously J.J is that busy??), here comes ST-into Darkness. I've seen it 2 times and going again with 3 others tomorrow, good movies you can watch a few times and every time you pick up something, J.J's Star Trek is one of those, leave some aftertaste and you are amazed how it can be a blockbuster but not a popcorn movie. The movie focused on the actions, visual effect, at the same time, capture each characters emotion, relationship, core value, so it doesn't give you a dry mouth of pure actions only, as female viewer I appreciate that ! Most importantly, this movie has a good story, good script, I know some Trekkies are not happy about reusing some characters or stories from previous, but Batman, Spiderman, Superman, all did that, plus Star Trek has some many good stories and characters in last few decades, use some of them will make a fantastic franchise, also the TV series stopped long time ago, it's time to reboot and attract new fans. J.J did great job on this, ST-Into Darkness is also expanding to overseas market, I would say great job! Last highlight I want to say is Music composition, Michael Giacchino did briiiiiiiliant job for 2 ST movies, I noticed the music since 2009, the soundtrack I could just listen to it along, beautiful and powerful, it adds another 50% boost to the movie I would say. Overall, I gave it 10, I know it's not perfect, but I'm so passionate about it, so going to give an irrational 10. If you are after a good movie, entertaining, inspiring story, go to watch it. If you are fussy about all the difference between this movie and previous Star Trek series, or you don't like they swap the time line, or change an Indian to an English, then don't bother to go, coz this is not a copy, it's a reboot :P",Star Trek Into Darkness

Please, go check it out, but prepare to walk out of the cinema significantly stupideR. No spoiler intended, but man, i can't get over cheesy bromance sequences that go on forever and just take the science edge of this, once great theme.

1054,altairmtever,Great Movie.A must-see!!,9,25 February 2014,"Well, this movie was absolutely fantastic. Star Trek will continue to raise new generations!!! I believe that it has earned a position into the top-3 of Star Trek movies(the others are First Contact(1996) and Nemesis (2002), the first with the best villains, the Borg and the latter with the best to my opinion space battle ,between Enteprise E and Scimitar).This movie has everything!!! The story is great which is an adaptation of ''The Wrath of Khan'' script and mixed up with other elements such as Admiral Marcus and his plans. The acting was good. Chris Pine(Kirk) and Zachary Quinto(Spock) perform in a very good level. Simon Pegg(Scotty) is great and incredibly funny and he excels in his role. But the true star of the movie is KHAN played by Benedict Cumberbatch.This guy is awesome. His is the best villain we have ever seen in Star Trek. He is ruthless, cold, merciless, genius but also very well back-rounded and it makes you feel sorry for him when his talks about his companions.Another point is given for the love-affair between Spock and Uhura. It was something that was missing from previous movies(with the exception of Diana Troy an Riker in Nemesis).The music was great like the previous movie and it's nice to see how Star Trek music has changed through the years by remembering the original series theme. The change is to the best and it adds to the movie.I do not know why some people hate it. I mean it's all there...the mystery, the exploration, Gene Roddenberry's goals with the addition of new visual effects which make it more beautiful and a little more action in order to introduce Star Trek to new fans and make them watch the series, without changing the original ideals o f the Star Trek Franchise.Great movie which deserves a little more respect.",Star Trek Into Darkness

It started off well enough, great special effects, exciting action and good characterisations but, when the big reveal of the villain came it all fell apart. I wanted to see something new, something never before attempted in a Star Trek movie, all I got was a tepid remake of The Wrath of Khan. Sure, Cumberbatch played a good bad guy and I liked the new look Klingons when they appeared but why rehash an old movie? Once Khan is revealed the movie just heads downhill and never recovers.

It has a lot of action scene and feels like a typical episode of star trek. HOWEVER it is not without its flaws. these flaw make this move slam hard into so many walls at warp speed that you will want to forget this ever existed just like that other (non) trek sham known as nemesis. God what were they thinking???Acting: Pros: Zachary Quinto was wonderful as Spock. Even if he overdid the robotic emotions now and then, he was much better than the rest of the cast.Karl Urban was just as funny and clever as in the first. Bones isn't a hard role to play, but still, he matches him perfectly.Simon Pegg was hilarious, and his presence just made me want to re-watch Hot Fuzz and Shaun of the Dead.Benedict Cumberbatch was pretty good, but not excellent.Cons: Zoe Saldana (as usual) was boring and flat. Due to her bad acting, I didn't really care about her character at all.Chris Pine is kind of boring. I don't really understand why he would be cast as a major character.John Cho is a really bad actor.

We shall rule again! I was blowen away by the tremendous acting! The acting may have been forced by the fact that women and children may have been watching the movie but it was tremendous! The all around startrekeyness of it was great! The movie is obviously meant to be something that you missed! It was a great sequel. That means that although it might have been a bad movie by a movie reviewers standards, that doesn't mean that it was a bad movie by the standards of the people whom watch it.

The first film in 2009 was okay but nothing special, but Into Darkness was brilliant in every way -it felt like 'Star Trek' was just an introduction to this film. The storyline, the edge of your seat action, the acting was all amazing. The plot wasn't one-dimensional, it had twists and turns, was fast-paced and unpredictable. There was plenty of action which was lightened with a few comedic quips (usually from Scotty). The villain was fully developed and Cumberbatch's other-world acting ability made him so believable. It was great seeing more of the villain this time around with a well-written back story so we could fully understand his actions.",Star Trek Into Darkness
1059,authormonicaburns,"Change is Good, But This Epic Failed - Not Good",4,21 May 2013,"Abrams's 2009 Star Trek was a fantastic and fresh storyline of how Kirk, Spock and Bones met. That film re-energized the franchise. Thus I fully expected him to meet or exceed the quality of that film. But, Into Darkness failed miserably.WARNING - Some Spoilers One reviewer pointed out that long-time fans (I'm one from TOS) need to embrace change. I embraced change with the 2009 film. I could have embraced change with Into Darkness too if Abrams had just given me a FRESH storyline, not a rehash of an old one. I want new stories of these alternative universe characters. I don't want the exact replicas of the old stories, and don't insult my intelligence by retelling the old with slightly modified characters and scenes stolen from the original.SPOILER ALERT ----------------------- I expected ORIGINAL material from JJ. Instead I got a bad retelling of 1982's Wrath of Kahn! If you're doing a remake, at least tell people you're doing that. Don't cloak it in mystery just to up the box office receipts.Into Darkness starts out great then falls into an abyss that is a mere shadow of the 1982 film. JJ steals actual scenes from the original, rather than creating a totally new storyline with the new alternative universe characters.Long-time fans will know almost at the start Cumberbatch is Kahn. Cumberbatch for all his brilliance as an actor is stuck in a role that Ricardo Montalban made indelible (much as John Colicos did with the character of Kor). There are some characters it's just impossible to reinvent.Worse, the main characters are caricatures of the originals. I love Urbane, but by film's end I was ready to slap McCoy at the next word. Simon Pegg as Scotty, and the awesome special effects, was the film's one saving grace. Pine, played the Playboy to the hilt in the same manner Shatner did on the TV show. A shame, because the guy has great range of acting ability.Zachary Quinto is the actor I feel is truly out of his element, whether due to poor acting or a bad script. It doesn't help that he made such a wonderful villain in Heroes that perhaps it's difficult to get beyond that typecasting. I found his performance wooden and lacking in the true vulnerability that Nimoy brought to the role. It's difficult to step into the shoes of an icon, but maybe Qunito will find it possible to make the new Spock his own. Time will tell. If he keeps getting scripts like Into Darkness, he's lost.One of the worst images on screen were the costumes. Can I just say those uniforms AND the hats were reminiscent of the SS forces during the Nazi regime? Any costume designer would have a hard time reinventing a new look for the franchise, but this was an epic fail.Long-time fans of Star Trek will probably be disappointed in the movie. New fans won't know the difference and find it wonderful. Color me extremely disappointed and betrayed by a director I thought truly ""got"" the Star Trek universe and its fans. I'm up for change, but don't give me an old storyline, wrapped up in glitzy special effects and a poor script. Change means stepping up the game.

The actor who plays Harrisson (the ""modern Sherlock"") is a good surprise in this kind of character. Chris Pine is a good bad boy, without interest but with beautiful eyes.However it is not enough to stay concentrate. The film is noisy, a long scene of battle, fight and explosion.

What disturbs me most is that it has virtually anything to do with the original Star Treks and its sequels. The characters do have similar names, but that's it. Star Trek has always (or at least most of the times) been based on a good story, not spectacular tricks and some van Damme style violence. But in this movie the actual storyline is thin as rice paper and its more like a C-class action movie. And since this is supposed to be in the time line BEFORE the ST-original series, why the bridge had to be designed to be so futuristic? In general the whole idea of making something preceding the original series sounds not so good. Since obviously the saga will go on even after this movie, I'd let the old crew into history and made something like a 3rd generation using the characters of both DS9 and Voyager and some totally new ones.

It also hinted little things that many people may not have picked up on, like that hand motions that Kirk made and the way he sat down.

The special effects are definitely great, the story is interesting but the actuation is pathetic with dialogs at the level of kindergärtner discussions. J.J. Abrams tried desperately not to bore the viewers with their own thoughts by creating this high-pace movie full of explosions and ultra- violence.

You do not have to have seen any of the previous movies to watch this one but if you have you will see characters that you heard of before. Because I had seen the prior movies, it made it more enjoyable to me. I was entertained thoroughly and say that if that is what you are going for, then go. Enjoy it. I did.

After that, it kinda with down hill for me. I felt cheated the way the story turned out as it seemed like the writers got lazy towards the end. I was somewhat stunned at what I had just witnessed on-screen and after seeing it again, I still felt the same. I guess maybe I'm a crazed Star Trek fan to think that. Other reviews have focused on the good or on the bad. I tried to be less analytical and see this movie for what it is. A mainly a fast paced action film interspersed with scenes of human interest which facilitates the deeper development of the main characters and their inter- relationships.

Enter John Harisson, a man from their own community which becomes a big threat to the whole galaxy.",9,15 June 2013,"This is one of the Landmark films made by J.J. Abrams. HATS OFF to the whole team of Star Trek. They have made a film which is not only Good- looking in effects only, but it has lot more to offer. Firstly, I am not a very big fan of Star trek, but this movie just blew my mind away due to many reasons. The Acting was phenomenal by every cast member. Indeed, the Scene stealer, in my opinion, was without doubt Benedict Cumberbatch. What an exceptional portrayal of a 'Clever' villain. From his entry till end, his presence was felt at each moment with a certain anxiety. He has really done a great job. His dialog delivery is just pure excellence in many scenes (I cannot point out, but you'll get to know as you see the movie). Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto were equally good and flawless in their roles. Great Performances and Emotional appeal. Secondly, The Movie's plot and direction are top-notch. The Large Scale CGI Effects. The whole Sci-Fi setup. The Camera-work. The Background music. Everything just molded so well on celluloid that the Impact of the film just boosted. I saw this movie in 3D. I personally never favor a 3D movie. But Surprisingly this movie contained very well executed 3D scenes, which astounded the audience at several moments. They were not the best but still surprisingly were not bad at all. Music was also note-worthy. There is always a silent scene in a star trek movie. In the previous movie (2009) it also had a complete silent scene if people would remember. There's one in this one too. It was one of the highlights of the movie, where the audience was like 'OMG'. Lastly, The only regret i have is this that the plot was just okay. It had ample scope for many twists and thrills. The movie is more about effects, acting and Sci-Fi. The Plot should have contained that edge-on- the-seat factor like the dark knight. No doubt movie had some thrills, but were less. This was the only con i felt about the movie. Otherwise the movie is perfect in all means. A must watch in 3D cinema. Highly recommended for Sci-Fi lovers. :)",Star Trek Into Darkness

1069,brucecoughran-527-672003,Good as far as it goes...which isn't far.,5,22 May 2013,"I have to say at the outset I am puzzled as to why people seem to like this movie so much. It does have wonderful sets (even if it seems to feel like they were all recycled from the last Star Trek movie or a Mission Impossible set piece). The characters are likable enough, but paper thin. The script seems like it was written by a 14 year-old, obvious and un-nuanced. The photography is supremely well crafted, but without an ounce of creativity or artistic flair. There seems to be no real vision here, some of the dialog is embarrassingly obvious and unjustified.I also have to say that there seems to be a real lack of honoring Gene Rodenberry's intentions at almost every plot turn. Kirk actually says at the beginning something to the effect of ""Violating the Prime Directive....What's the big deal?"" After Rodenberry, who was so groundbreaking with casting choices, the new character introduced here is a cute, young blond with a unexplained New Zealand accent.So as light entertainment, I think the movie does fine. Why a star trek fan, or anyone looking for any kind of substance, would think this movie was good...I just don't know.I don't think it is even worth exploring some of the weird thematic elements (like the seeming celebration of uncontrolled rage, not only from Kirk, but then from Spock who mercilessly beats the Khan because of his anger, and this is supposed to show he has become more ""human""???) Is this the future of big budget screen writing??",Star Trek Into Darkness

Scenes that should have brought a cheer from the crowd passed by with groans or titters of embarrassed laughter and dear Hollywood,I know this is the year of the derivative with Oblivion and Star Trek using the same algorithms to rehash everything that came before....but I swear if I see one more....just one more chase scene with a ship flying on its side to get thru the thin space between buildings or cliff walls I am out .... because it probably means everything that follows is just as much re-hash too.

1071,robertsonsmithwoods,Plot Holes Galore,2,27 May 2013,"Since I am discussing bad plotting, this review is chock full of spoilers.There is a simple way to check a plot for holes. Simply look at the characters' motives and see if their actions result from those motives. It is particularly important to check this for the villains, because the sloppy or lazy writer just uses the villains to set up obstacles for the heroes without regard for logic or motivation.The two villains here are Khan and General Marcus.Khan's goals are (1) reassemble his crew (2) get a starship (3) dominate the galaxy. So what does he do? He blows up a Starfleet archive, attacks Starfleet command and then .... flees to an uninhabited sector of the Klingon Empire. Now why does a super-genius think that this furthers his immediate goals of unfreezing his crew and acquiring a vessel, or better yet, a fleet? But here's where the unbelievable General Marcus comes in. General Marcus' goals are (1)secretly assemble a massive Starfleet military force in preparation for war with the Klingons (2) provoke said war with the Klingons ... even before his awesome armada is built except for one ship (huh?) (3)protect his lovely daughter. To this end he enlists Khan to help him design his superbattleship of space (which weirdly can be controlled by just one crewman). Then, when Khan escapes and decimates the Starfleet Command which is vital to his projected war, Marcus decides now is the perfect time to provoke the Klingons.So he sends Kirk to fire long-range photon torpedoes from neutral space to kill Khan. And he makes sure the Enterprise is crippled in neutral space, so that the Klingons discover and presumably capture the Starfleet vessel bombarding them. EXCEPT...for no reason whatsoever, the torpedoes are loaded with the cryogenically frozen bodies of Khan's crew. Which means the Enterprise is firing duds and the Klingons will only discovered a disabled Enterprise just outside their space. Which is hardly the causus belli Marcus wants to create.Naturally enough, Kirk of the Enterprise does not fire the weapons. Because of nice speech about how it is wrong to kill vicious terrorist assassins with drones on foreign soil rather than bringing them back to stand trial (gee, wonder what present day parallel the writers are thinking about). So, Marcus has to send his supership, not to start the Klingon war himself, but to kill Kirk, Khan and the Enterprise crew. Because... I don't know, just because he is eeeeeevil.But he screws even this up and Khan gets control of the superbattleship of space, which, by sheer damn good luck, one man can run. So, Khan goes on a rampage and smashes his flying vessel into some skyscrapers on Earth (hmmm, wonder what events inspired the writers). Yes, I wonder, particularly in view of more dull speechifying that there will always be those trying to destroy us, but we mustn't lower ourselves by, you know, retaliating.Preachy, yes.

1073,jordanjohnvaughan,Brilliant,9,5 August 2013,"I'll start by saying when it comes to Star Trek I don't know my Kling'on from my Vulcan; however I watched both the first ((J.J.Abrams)I'm a Novice) and this film on the weekend and the first film was very good I didn't really enjoy Nero so that left the villain spot lacking. The one thing I have to say is BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH; I'm not a cumberbitch, at all and I'm British so his accent is normal to me, however that was such a performance that even when he wasn't on screen he was still very much affecting the film and when he was on it you couldn't take your eyes off of him for me he was the star of the show. Chris Pine played Kirk very well and convinced the audience that everyone has a kid in them and needs to mature. (I hope I haven't offended any Trekkies). One problem that I do have though is (SPOILER ALERT) when Khan and Spock fight at the end I don't understand how he even lasted more than a minute and why did Khan run?!? One other is that why did they need to take Khan alive? They had 72 other superhumans that I imagine had the same blood capabilities. (I could be overlooking some massive plot point that had I watched the original series' I would know the answer to both so if thats the case ignore the last to points) Other than those two very small points it was amazing and again Cumberbatch put in the performance of his life!",Star Trek Into Darkness
1074,joe-594-809946,JJ Abrams Continues to impress,9,12 May 2013,"Walking into the theatre I was new to the whole Star Trek franchise. Only a few days before I had watched the first instalment in the film reboot series and only knew bits and pieces of the original series' history. However after watching the 2009 film I was eagerly anticipating it's sequel and it certainly did not disappoint. The cast's acting is outstanding all round especially at the game changing scenes, particularly with Zachary Quinto during the rare moments where Spock displays his deepest emotions. However I feel that the best acting throughout the film came from Benedict Cumberbatch as the antagonist Johnny Harrison. From the moment you meet the character you are already aware of his sinister nature and throughout, Cumberbatch is able to make you aware of his brutality and even at moments in the film, empathise with him as he describes the path that led him to be the terrorist the audience see before them.One thing that I have noticed about the negative reviews from avid Star Trek fans is that the plot almost veers too far away from the original stories mirrored in this film. Although I can understand why this may boil the blood of some, I feel the need to point out that this film franchise is an alternate time line (as revealed in the previous film). If the plot was a word for word replica of the previous storyline then there would be no surprises, no curiosity as to what will happen next. The alternate time line keeps the franchise fresh and also allows the films to open up to newbies such as myself to a long celebrated series. As someone who has little knowledge of the original plot I have to say that I thoroughly enjoyed the story, and that every scene would bring out different emotions in the audience whether it be joy or pain. The film does have everything from mind blowing special effects (made more special if the film is viewed in the IMAX which I would highly recommend)to moments of comic relief mainly provided of course by the hilarious Simon Pegg as Scotty.Whether you have been a Trekkie all of your life or are completely new to the cult series, Into Darkness is a film for any sci-fi fan and I would gladly see it again if given the opportunity.",Star Trek Into Darkness
1075,Eng-NugentW19,"The next voyage of the star trek enterprise, only this time trying to hunt down Khan",9,24 May 2013,"This movie was phenomenal. The acting, the cinematography, and the visual/special effects were top of the game. I recommend this movie to all Trekkie's EVEN if you didn't like the first one. I am not a Trekkie but I saw the first one and thought it was just all right, after I saw this one I am seriously considering becoming one! (o.k. maybe a little exaggeration). But overall, the movie was great so stop reading this review and get to the theater! (or red box if it's on DVD)! Now, I have nothing more to say but IMDb won't let me through without ten lines so I'll just have to stall, I mean tell you a little more. The director J.J. Abrahams reminds me a lot about Tampa Bay Ray's manager Joe Madden. I say this because none of the actors before the first movie were very well known but he really forces them to gel and overall they made a very good cast.",Star Trek Into Darkness
1076,calypsoart,Roddenberry would have initiated Star Trek self destruct if he knew that is what they'd do with it.,2,5 June 2013,"I give it 2 stars, 1 for the production design and 1 for Cumberbatch. On Jon Stewart Abrams said he had not been a fan of Star Trek. With this movie it became glaringly obvious! Everything that made Trek the phenomenon it is, was washed away and replaced with Transformers level absurdity. And seriously, there is a difference between Homage, and the calculated lifting of scenes from previous iterations of the franchise. No need to go into the stinker of a script. These people should be writing for Lifetime movies. Don't know how to address a plot hole? Just showcase expensive effects, or insert clichéd throwback dialogue.The truth is, they made money, not a Star Trek story. And that is all that matters. Roddenberry created a masterpiece of entertainment and thought. Abrams made money. I look forward to seeing Cumberbatch again in ""Sherlock"", stories where quality runs rampant.",Star Trek Into Darkness
1077,hutchins_77,Boldly go where no man has gone before my arse.,1,14 May 2013,"(THIS CONTAINS SPOILERS PEOPLE, YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED)I'll start with the good: Cumberbatch is excellent and knows how to make a good villain, but only when we do realize who he is I can't help but think it's an imitation of the previous version. Peter Weller makes an excellent admiral and really does bring presence to the screen.The action and visual effects are all excellent, but this is to be expected of a film this large and Abrams does a solid job giving every crew member their moment to shine, bar one character whose names should have been Mrs. Plot Point.(SPOILERS)My main problem with this film is the fact that for those fans out there, there will come a moment where you put two and two together and sigh in contempt - which I heard about another 70 people do at the same time as me. The whole third act kind of felt like a slap to the face to Trek fans, I'm no die hard Trekkie but I enjoy the films, and every throw back to Khan felt forced and melodramatic. The fact that Quinto's Spock can call Nimoy's Spock out of the blue is cheap and out of place, and the whole radiation chamber scene while ""clever"" for reversing the roles is boring and predictable. But if you haven't seen Wrath of Khan then this will be quite a shock, for a few minutes at the least.Overall, I wish that the Kilngons had been given a larger role as they were quite awesome, and I have the feeling they will be the main antagonist in the third film in 20-whenever-it-gets-made. The many bad things in this film outweighed the few good bits.",Star Trek Into Darkness
1078,dchintx,alternate reality,9,16 May 2013,"Although quite a Star Trek fan from both the original TV series (yes, I'm THAT old to have watched the original) and the many movies and spin offs, I still enjoy Abrams playing with the alternate reality for the new series and don't think the stories have to be tied that much to the old series.I find this new look refreshing, but I also enjoy the small kudos to earlier story lines. And what is not to love about our new/old nemesis played by Benedict Cumberbatch, who I loved in the TV Sherlock series. More than one character shows emotion and I especially enjoyed those moments and was moved to tears myself, but I especially enjoyed BC's performance talking about his crew to be truly moving.Lots of action to thrill those who go for that, but I'll still take a good storyline any day. Thought ST fulfilled both of that criteria.Definitely give it a thumbs up and plan to go see it again.",Star Trek Into Darkness
1079,jtpowers_01,Beams me up!,10,16 May 2013,"Star Trek Into Darkness combines good-to-excellent CGI, a fast-paced plot with original series undertakings/conflicts that will excite, I believe, the novice Trekkies along with enduring fans. It holds you in a constant crisis mode - nearly 75% of the time is racing against the clock - and that allows only little moments for characters to interact more deeply. You get these moments - but its in up close, quick conversations where neither party (or parties) get to dwell too long on, or able to revise their thoughts, which is actually the best for it.In fact, one scene is too much exposition - really the only one - but it served as a way to feel as others have when all they treasure is being destroyed or taken from them: it is the primary source of conflict in this movie.The course of this movie is set in rapid fire, almost WWII battle scene action, where things will get missed on first pass. I've seen STID twice now, and I got more from it the 2nd run. Not a bad thing - it is imminently watchable for the action junkie; and,a necessity for the Trekkie to compare and contrast details missed. The twists are much like a war - retreat/devise plan/counterattack/on-the-fly decisions - so if you like that, great, if you like a psychological and silent exploration, or brooding, foreboding, unknown conflict, well this movie will disappoint on that level.It shouldn't though. Kirk and Spock cement their visible bond. Sulu envisions his future. McCoy accepts begrudgingly with metaphor always handy. Scotty is Scotty - wisecracking his way through and to warp 9. And a future trek is possible -even as sacrifices/choices were made - as a ""Star Trek Beyond Space and Time"" movie could happen...(My suggestion for a future title.) In comparison to other action - superhero adventures (Marvel), Trek has equaled their level, and surpassed in my opinion. Only the Dark Knight trilogy is far superior - and that should tell you something. Kudos to JJ Abrams for taking on the venerable and while not sticking directly to it, he does his homages to the source material. Not without flaws or corniness, but it's a 2-hr movie, not an exam.",Star Trek Into Darkness
1080,andykuchen,Absolutely Amazing,7,26 May 2013,"Just when you thought the first movie was good, the second one is even better. JJ Abrams returns to make a movie that is much more dark and much more intense. The effects are out of this world. The acting is impeccable. Chris Pine, Zachary Quinto, Zoe Saldana, Benedict Cumberbatch... they are all talented and bring so much to the film. The whole crew of the Enterprise is put to the test in this epic movie. Think if Into Darkness as what The Dark Knight was to Batman Begins. That much more diabolical and fiendish. Although, The Dark Knight is a better movie than Star Trek Into Darkness, Into Darkness has a lot of great elements and dialogue that makes the movie a thriller. Highly recommended and must see it again!",Star Trek Into Darkness
1081,bcdserra,Trekkies rage LOL !,10,23 August 2013,"Star Trek fans, they are hilarious. So much hate towards details, so much far-fetched criticism, it shows most of them had decided to hate it before even seeing it. The biggest complains seem to be the negation of the old series and the missing of Gene Roddeberry's philosophical and social points. How can you make new generations discover a story and expect them to take in account an 80-episode (first story only!) long back-story from decades ago ? It doesn't work like that. I am a 33y old man, and even I was too young to clearly remember it all. You have to let go of those things and start over, something JJ Abrams did in a fantastically thrilling and entertaining way. Into Darkness supposedly misses Gene Roddenberry's points about building a better world and similar topics. Most Trekkies' hate was so focused on this they missed the fact that some of the man's other favored themes were chosen to star in this film; friendship and sacrifice. It doesn't matter if some characters were interchanged for the remake of some iconic scenes, it doesn't matter if fan's extensive knowledge of the series forbids them to believe a starship can ""go on certain terrain"". If you like science fiction, action, a good movie and Benedict Cumberbatch's voice, hurry up and watch this roller-coaster ride !! 10/10",Star Trek Into Darkness

From that point of view, the only thing in my mind about this movie is that it is horrible!!! usually, Star Trek is about a great future of humankind, a place of great accomplishments and great ideas put into real effective work. Into Darkness is just a dismembered collection of lines and visual special effects. No great ideas, no real contradiction, nothing. The only good thing about this movie is the the actor's performance. I liked the two Spocks, the new Khan and especially Bones.According to these assertions, I give the worse rate ever for a movie!!!",Star Trek Into Darkness

If you can't accept the fact that all of the familiar faces are replaced, don't spend the money to watch it - you won't be able to enjoy yourself. That being said, I just got back from the theater and I thoroughly enjoyed myself. As a lifelong Trekkie and a big fan of Benedict Cumberbatch, I made it a point to go see it on the opening weekend. I'm not going to try to spoil the plot, but existing Trekkies will be pleased to see throwbacks to the older movies (**Spoiler: To the second film in particular**).Everyone's acting was top-notch. Spock (Quinto) and John Harrison (Cumberbatch) were both exceptionally written. I would definitely watch this movie again. And again. And again.",Star Trek Into Darkness

Over dramatized to the point of ridiculousness. The disaster scenes were ridiculous. The damage sustained in some of the scenes should have completely destroyed the ship several times over. Too much time spent on action and not enough on story line left me confused in several parts. I would rate this film a just short of awful, and am grateful I didn't spend good money to see it in the theater. Glad I had access to someone else's video and didn't waste any of my money on it.

1087,capttravis-679-428018,First half was fantastic...but then it crashed and burned.,7,16 May 2013,"I have to say this movie was the one I was most excited for. I have been a Star Trek fan for a long time. I've never been quite as big a fan as others, which is why I don't consider myself a ""Trekkie"" but I enjoyed all the series to some degree,and for the most part I enjoyed the movies. So, was my excitement validated? In one word: meh.Honestly this movie had a lot of good points. The first Star Trek movie did a fantastic job of creating a believable world for the main cast to operate in. As a fan of the series, it was nice to see the plywood sets be transformed into this massive realistic world. This new film builds on that and expands the universe the first movie created. If you love action there is plenty of it. The first 2/3 of the movie are very well paced, and filled with great action scenes. Benedict Cumberbatch does an outstanding job as the villain. He is a very threatening villain who you BELIEVE could take out the entire Enterprise crew and all of Starfleet. In fact for the first 2/3 of the movie everyone's acting was great. They were funny, emotional, and believable. It's a fun ride...and if you enjoyed the first movie you will probably enjoy this one. You probably noticed me mentioning the first 2/3 of the movie. That's because there is a turning point in this movie. And from that point on the movie crashed faster than the ship in the trailer, and left no survivors. The rest of the movie is confusing, cheap, and lazy. They didn't create any new characters, and relied on poorly recreating scenes from the original movie, because they were too lazy to write new and interesting ones. Say what you will about Nemesis, but at least the plot was original (stupid as it may be). Is it worth seeing? Yes...even though it's not as good as I expected, and there are some MAJOR flaws, it is fun, energetic, and will keep your attention. I give this movie a C (honestly though I'd give the first half of the movie an A+ and the second half a D.) Bottom Line: The movie is decent and the effects are enjoyable...but does not deserve all the praise. The first half is fantastic and worth seeing, but by the end the story becomes lazy and pointless.",Star Trek Into Darkness
1088,paulgab,Star Trek The Wrath of Khan Parity,2,11 May 2013,"Firstly, let me say that both the visual effects and sound track are both great, but it's all down hill from there.The opening scene, I completely agree with Scotty when he says ""You know how completely ridiculous it is to hide a starship on the bottom of the ocean?"" Yes this ridiculous, it is a spaceship not a submarine. The ship could have stayed in orbit and either beamed the cold fusion device directly into the volcano or beamed Spock with the device down and then beamed him up. This entire scene feels like it was an excuse to get the cast into 23rd century swimmers.Next, the effect when the ships go into warp has changed since the last film. Why do the ships leave a trail of shiny star dust at warp? When Star Trek was rebooted in the last film, the warp effect was updated, this was the time to add this (I still wouldn't have liked this effect). They should have kept this effect consistent for both films.Though this film comes after the Enterprise series, making it canon, the appearance of the Klingons, the design of the Bat'leth and the Bird of Prey have all been changed. These are all key Star Trek components are shouldn't be tampered with.Having Dr. Carol Marcus change uniforms in a shuttle while Kirk is asked to turn his back, is just a pathetic excuse to see Alice Eve in her underwear, and is completely unnecessary to the story.Many parts of the story were predictable and were taken directly from The Wrath of Khan with a slight twist. Having Benedict Cumberbatch's character of John Harrison ending up to be Khan was no surprise. Having Kirk die while saving the ship instead of Spock and having Spock yell KHAN instead of Kirk, these parts were just swapped from The Wrath of Khan. The audience I was with, was shocked in horror that these scenes were rehashed again. When Bones was experimenting with Khan's blood to resurrect a dead tribble, it was obvious that this was going to be used to bring back Kirk.The design of the Enterprise has as been tampered with. When falling to Earth, since when did the Enterprise have 10+ thrusters in the underside of the saucer section of the ship? Secondly, why does the Engineering section have torpedo tubes down both sides to firer the long range torpedoes? This made me think of a pirate ship with canons along both sides. These should have been fired via the existing fore or aft torpedo tubes.The Wrath of Khan is possibly the best film of the first ten and should never have been touched upon again. 2 of the 3 three writers claim to be long time trek fans, if so, they should have known that this would not be taken well from existing fans. The previous film also had a few issues that I wasn't happy with (Enterprise being constructed on Earth instead of in orbit, a Cardassian beverage though we don't meet the Cardassians for about another 100 years and having a Orion (the green women) members in Star Fleet as the Orion Syndicate were enemies of the Federation), but as the story was original and good, these few issues I can turn a blind eye to. Unfortunately, Into Darkness has too many issues for me to forgive. The writers have an universe of new stories they could write, don't go rehashing content from previous films.",Star Trek Into Darkness
1089,ando66412,Disappointing remake,2,9 May 2013,"I was looking forward to the next chapter in the reboot of the Star Trek universe, having enjoyed the first one very much. This remake of a classic Star Trek movie was however, in my opinion, not a patch on the original. The effects were seamless and well done, however the characters lacked the presence of the original crew and seeing some of them cry, etc seemed a little 'un-Star trek"" to me. I wanted to see Kirk and co. develop into the type of leader and crew that they were in the original movies, however the assured leadership and almost cocky surety of command decisions was replaced by apologetic and unsure leadership. Spock seemed to have lost the Vulcan coolness that made him, well Spock, and Dr McCoy was rarely sighted. The potentially moving scenes were nowhere near as moving as those in the original, and it seemed as if the writers could not find original ideas. I think with all of the potential story lines that could have been made, a remake of a classic original movie was a bad choice and doesn't work. I hope they allow the characters to develop in the next one and choose an original story line.",Star Trek Into Darkness

1093,josephdonald316,PC moralising grates amongst the explosions,4,9 May 2013,"I had a real problem with the underlying political/social commentary running through this film.War with the Klingons gets discussed, only for us to learn that they are being 'provoked' by a militaristic Starfleet Admiral who is arming the Federation to deal with potential threats. Say what? I understood the Klingons to be a warrior race, born and bred conquerors. The Federation better arm up or humanity will end up a vassal state of the Klingon Empire. A Pollyanna-esque ""we can all get along if we are nice to each other"" attitude doesn't cut it when facing the bat'leths.Then there is the main 'bad guy' - a well-spoken, white Englishman. Notice how bad guys these days can't be aliens or 'ethnics' anymore? Apparently it demonizes the 'other' – read black people, refugees, Muslims, etc. Hence we get dark skinned Klingons being 'provoked' before trying to kill everyone in sight, and a nice, safe, white English toff bad guy we are 'allowed' to hate. The same was seen in Iron Man 3; Guy Pearce is the boo-hiss bad guy and an Osama Bin Laden knock-off turns out not to be bad (or ethnic) after all...The message this film (and many like it) convey is that rich, white Western people are in fact the bad guys - and that it's our fault when the 'not really' bad guys kill us.The action sequences were great but the PC ideology was just grating.

Would like to see McCoy get more lines as I think he's a really engaging character and one that DeForest Kelly would I'm sure be proud to see.

The acting is very good especially from Benedict Cumberbatch, the plot is quite good but occasionally predictable especially towards the end. The end of the film sets up nicely for another film which will be amazing. Overall i think this new star trek film is better than most of the star trek films but could have improved the plot and been a bit more less predictable.Another thing that annoyed me was that there was quite a lot of language mainly B words but still star trek barely ever had language in it.

1096,dfarley1-682-976759,Explosive and exceeds expectations,9,11 May 2013,"I will be the first to admit. I hate Star Trek. I am not a fan of the older films or the TV series. I found them dull, mundane and boring to say the least. However, when the re-boot came out a few years ago it blew me away and as the curtains closed left me with all sorts of ideas regarding how good the sequel would be. What can I say, it doesn't disappoint in any shape or form.It has all of the same breath taking moments as its previous instalment and including moments of sheer brilliance. Pine (Kirk) heads up the cast once more with his brash, rock and roll, playboy approach to the captain and Quinto (Spock) is suited fantastically to the role. However for me it was Cummberbatch (Khan) who stole the show. What a performance!! I always analyse villains in my movies and as far as I'm concerned no one touches Heath Legder's Joker or Gary Oldman's crazed cop Stansfield in Leon The Professional. However, this guy gets close. Every time he is on screen the tension builds and due to this the excitement of seeing him on screen builds every single time he is off of it. His hatred for everyone and everything is demonstrated incredibly well and his 'secret plots' remind me of the madness and secretness of the Joker from The Dark Knight.Overall this was breath-taking and I rarely say that about any film that is released in this day and age. If you are sitting around wondering weather or not to take the plunge with this one, I would recommend that it is well worth your 8 quid! Better than the previous film..... Most definitely.

I watched it a second time today (in 3D) and enjoyed it as much as the first time. Again, I benchmark the use of 3D against Dredd 3D and in this effort I would say it is not quite up to par. It's not bad, but it is just used the way it is in most 3D films these days, to add image depth and immersion. On the film itself. I like JJ's handling of the franchise. He also has a budget to make this incarnation which the previous films could only have dreamed of. So you do get to see stuff you always wanted to see in the previous trek film franchises. So again you get mind bending special effects and settings never before seen such as Earth (at ground level), Kronos (never really fully explored much since ST:TNG/DS9) and the use of ships within planet atmosphere's (and under an ocean!).Well versed trekkies will note many of the changes to the original timeline again in this film and those changes influence the story to a large degree, particularly where the antagonist is concerned.JJ has also appeased long time fans be getting in a lot of character development and the actors seem to pull it off very well. I note it only because this is an essential element to a trek film, particularly where these characters are concerned and a failure by a cast to meld properly (excuse the pun) has caused problems in syndication (NX-01 crew!). The character arcs and intense story work extremely hard to 'fit' into a movie sized meal though and the intensity is maintained from start to finish. You don't get the audience fatigue like you may have gotten from The Dark Knight, but it was close for me. There are some elements to the film which don't take themselves to seriously though and the hat tipping to the original timeline is included. Not sure I like that, but it's not a distraction for me........ except for......you guessed it.......the purists......who have been quite vocal since the film debut.An open letter to anti-JJ Star Trek purists.Dear fellow Nerds,FFS let it go. This is not your father's Star Trek. This franchise had to change to survive, and while I agree with you that the Rodenberry legacy has been de-emphasised to some degree, it is not totally lost. Surely you must realise that today almost two decades on from when Star Trek on the big and little screen peaked, that any Trek is good Trek. Stop being a bunch of whiney andorians and bring back the love. Or continue bitching....it doesn't matter.......you know you'll be going to the cinema to see it anyway Yours Faithfully,King Nerd.Overall though I rate the film a solid 9/10. Good character development thanks to competent actors, awesome special effects and never-before- seen sequences and a great story which compliments the entire history of the franchise.",Star Trek Into Darkness

1099,jarkimond,What a film!,10,12 May 2013,"--NO SPOILERS-- Although viewers who haven't seen the original Star Trek series/films or the 2009 film may struggle relating to the characters, this film is outstanding. I went to see this with my partner, her step-father and his wife and we all enjoyed it. Her father is a massive fan of the original series, where as my partner and I were fans of TNG, Voyager and the 2009 film, but we were on the edge of our seats the whole time. Action, Drama, mystery, romance, crime, thrills, comedy, twists and turns; this film has it all. JJ Abrams has directed this film extraordinarily well, and fortunately got rid of much of the lens flare that became OTT in the 2009 film. It has given me faith in him to carry on the Star Wars legacy, of which he has recently been announced as director.Well done to all the cast and crew, you should be proud!Go see this film, ignore your cold or achy back, seeing this gem on the big screen will make it all worth it!",Star Trek Into Darkness
1100,mobiledj07,Worst Star Trek Ever,1,12 May 2013,"Star Trek Into Darkness wants to do just that fall off the edge of the world into darkness and never see the light of day again. It is absolute rubbish, full of continuity errors, ripped off scenes from other classic star trek films, total confusion over character origins and timelines. In short Paramount should refund the money of every person who went to see it. If that is the way the new breed of Star Trek films is being handled, then all I can say to Paramount is to cease their involvement with the Star Trek name and go back to making westerns about the 7th Cavalry. If you have not been to see this movie don't save your money for a night at Blockbuster Video Rentals and watch the classic Star Trek movies. On a scale of 1 to 10 I would give this latest offering minus 10 minimum.",Star Trek Into Darkness
1101,mithras001,An excellent movie.,9,13 May 2013,"I have to say that I am not an original Star Trek fan, and I barely watched any Star Trek series before Star Trek the movie issued at 2009, and to be honest, that was the only Star Trek movie that I liked.It was good, something new from the original series, the custom and acting was excellent.So the new one came out, I thought, sure I would go and have a look, even if it's half good as last one I will be happy. I was wrong. Into Darkness is so good, that I have to stop myself from crying few times. I knew Captain Kirk won't die, but all the sacrifice that he has to made touched me somehow. For me, this movie is not just about a group of people exploring the universe,it's also about love,fear,friendship, family, and how far you willing to go for the loved ones. The movie has some clichés, such as how he revived buy the'super blood', and how they port Spock out of the volcano at the last sec. But I enjoyed them as part of the movie. The fighting in space, between 2 space ships are massive, so realistic. The small fights between people are fine, and I enjoyed how they struggled during fight but finally won at last as always.",Star Trek Into Darkness
1102,kcjoss,Oh gawd please make it stop !!!!,2,13 May 2013,"Oh dear, oh dear.Just goes to show that squillions of dollars and a shed-load of cgi effects can't make up for a totally loopy, over-blown,juvenile 'plot'.It wasn't all bad - Spock and Harrison/Khan were actually pretty good, and the aforesaid cgi was exciting (albeit in a derivative kinda way).But...Pine was hopeless (except when being 'bad ass' he just looked goosed),whilst the excellent Urban, Soldana and Pegg were woefully under-used.The story made no freaking sense, having more holes in it than a Tetley teabag. There was little in the way of dialogue and less in the way of character development. The 'climax', with Spock and Khan going three rounds on the back of a flying dustcart, came straight out of a 1950s 'Flash Gordon' matinée.The musical score was of the DAHN-DAHN-DAHHHHHHNNNNNN variety, heavily underscoring any emotional sub-text that we dullards might have failed to notice.Please tell me JJ Abrams has left the building.Please make it stop.Perhaps then somebody good could take on the Trek franchise - Joss Whedon anyone?",Star Trek Into Darkness
1103,liverbirddan,brilliant,7,13 May 2013,This films shows a great awareness for the original series and has some new inspirational characters.To begin with the film starts with how the character of khan came into this film and why he sets out to end star fleet. as the film builds we begin to see more into this character as they try to show an innocent side which doesn't last long because as soon as he gets the chance he stabs Kirk in the back not literally and the movie begins to spiral into the never ending battle between the crew of the ss enterprise and the super bieng that is khan. as the film nears the end we see a side to Spock which proves his half humanity and fights with khan to eventually try and save the captain. i believe this is a brilliant sequel and i am hoping a third is in the making and i recommend it not only to the cooler geeks of the nation who like star trek but to all who live to see sci-fi action thrillers as this brings greatness to the cinema screens.,Star Trek Into Darkness
1104,miroslav-dubic,Give us TV series with this crew please,10,14 May 2013,"Many movies really fit to their trailers. All special things that you have in a movie this days you can find in their trailers. Not the same thing with this movie.I do not remember the movie that left me with this feeling in my chest that I have right now. As a fan I was very sceptical about the plot when I saw those few trailers. Now, after I've seen a movie, I can just smile when I remember the trailer. Zero disappointment.After Eugene Wesley Roddenberry, mister J.J. Abrams is 100% score to continue his work. Some people can still cry about the look and feel of TNG and TOS, but let's be real. New century is here. New technology comes every second. Our perception about future changes and J.J. Abrams is keeping a good track about that. Here goes my last sentence. Mr. Abrams, if you will read this one day, please give us TV series with this crew under your command. M.D.",Star Trek Into Darkness
1105,hardestyjamie,A thrilling sequel of warp-speed proportions,8,15 May 2013,"J.J.Abrams enjoyed great success in 2009 rebooting the Star Trek franchise to produce a cinematic experience which managed to please both traditional Trekkies and new fans alike. Receiving positive reviews from most film critics, Abrams' concoction of comedy, CGI, action and perfect casting breathed new life in to a saga, leaving viewers eager for more. 'Into Darkness' certainly picks up where it's predecessor left off, though this time we are propelled in to a world which knows no limits, as we are strapped in for an even faster paced roller-coasting thrill ride than we found in the first installment. Without doubt, this is a blockbuster of relentless proportions,fusing a core blend of character development and epic action sequences, to create a two hours of sheer box office entertainment. The film's premise revolves around Captain Kirk, expertly played by Chris Pine who seems to flawlessly ooze the required arrogance required for the role, pursuing a fugitive across the galaxy, only to discover there are greater forces at work than simply the terrorism or a madman. As the plot unfolds, the safety of Kirk's crew, or his 'family' as he values them, are continuously threatened and endangered, although this primarily comes from treachery within the hierarchy of the federation, as opposed to Cumberbatch's menacing villain. When Abrams introduced us to his interpretation of the Trek universe, the element of time travel was essential to the first movie's plot, producing some confusion amongst an otherwise enjoyable storyline. 'Into Darkness' places far less emphasis on the time travel aspect, as an audience we accept this is an alternate reality from the classic Star Treks of old, as understandable from Spock (played by the simply superb Zachary Quinto) and 'Prime' Spock (the original Leonard Nemoy) having a different destiny. Because we are now acquainted with this depiction, Into Darkness has a storyline far less convoluted than the 2009 Star Trek film, therefor the audience can simply sit back and enjoy an action movie that isn't weighed down by a plot which could lose audience appeal. After all, this is a reboot, this is a blockbuster. The humour, CGI and character relationships are the core strengths of the film and consequently we see the most emphasis placed on these aspects to produce a piece of cinema that provides simple but effective gratification.Perhaps the greatest strength of the film lies in the acting and the on screen relationships established. The bromance of Kirk and Spock, the rivalry between Kirk and Cumberbatch's villain and the fusion of the supporting cast, to produce a familiar yet memorable Star Trek ensemble allow us to recognise that this is Abrams' addition to the franchise, which not only reproduce conventions of the Star Trek characters of old but manage to produce a distinctiveness of their own. Take Karl Urban's role as 'Bones' for example, he delivers the classic 'damn it man I'm a doctor not a...' lines, though he brings an edginess and genuine humour that modern audiences can relate with. This is how Abrams has appealed to both worlds, that of the new viewer and already established fan. If you, like me, have been enticed by the trailers and found enjoyment in the 2009 reboot, then I urge you to invest your time in this film. It isn't perfect, it doesn't break the boundaries of cinema, but go in to the screen with an open mind. Switch off for two hours and allow yourself to enjoy the film for what it is. The CGI is credible, it's packed with witty metaphors and humour, it pays homage to traditional fans of the Star Trek universe (the infamous Klingons make an appearance) and it's loaded with high octane action sequences from start to finish. The acting of Pine, Quinto and Cumberbatch are good enough to see the film purely based on their involvement.Remember, it's a reboot, it's a blockbuster and it's a sequel to a recently rebuilt franchise... You have to be realistic and not expect too much. It doesn't make you re-evaluate film in it's entirety but as far as action goes, there's not much better out there. Go and see it, have fun and allow yourself to be a part of Captain Kirk's latest date with destiny! I can guarantee, Trekkie or not, you'll be quoting it afterwards...",Star Trek Into Darkness

Well if you loved the 4th one (Crystal Skull) then you'll still be disappointed with this film.Great actors - just bad casting, writing and directing. Horrible villain (Cumberland is a great actor just wrong part). Just be prepared.I loved the last film they came out with. The Romulans were well done, casting, writing, everything! However this show was like a bad episode of DS9 when they are in the alternate reality -- for the 7th time. Plot holes, lack of physics and unoriginality are just a few things to ""look forward"" to.If you watch it - leave enough time to come home and watch a good movie afterwords.PS - If you saw the prequel that was at the beginning of the Hobbit there's no reason to see it in 3D and/or IMAX since apparently all of the cool things that made the 3D and IMAX worth it happened in those 9 minutes.PPS - for a better review with spoilers http://scifi4me.com/2013/05/16/star-trek-into-darkness-review/",Star Trek Into Darkness
1107,rydawgg10,Abrams Saving Sci-Fi?,7,15 May 2013,"****MAY INCLUDE SPOILERS*****I cannot express how excited I am for the future of science fiction films, and the genre as a whole with Abrams at the helm. With that being said, some portions of this film were lack luster, however the film doesn't disappoint.In typical fashion, Abrams holds all of the cards until the end of the film, however the reveal this time isn't as astonishing as his first film. WIth the introduction of Kahn to the series, and previous premise of alternate time zones, we are under the assumption that any character in this series can possibly re-enter at any point.The performances by Kirk, Uhura, and Spock are emotional and moving even when they don't intend to be. Long story short, this film continues in on a great path, however the film is exactly what you expect, and I would have liked for that insane Abrams twist to truly wow me in my seat. Great film, great action, great plot, however a step below what I expected from this usually intelligent and witty director (Star Trek, LOST, Super 8, and Cloverfield)Imax if you can, however a definite film you should see this Summer in the theater, lets just hope he does a great job with Star Trek 3 which was just announced.",Star Trek Into Darkness
1108,zjb5802,Great Movie That Casual Movie Fans Will Like & Trekkies Will LOVE,9,16 May 2013,"What's great about ""Star Trek Into Darkness"" is that it does what few Treks ever do....it will (for the most part) unite the Trekkie and casual movie goer alike in their enjoyment of it.First off, I'll confess that I did like the original series and saw quite a few of the Trek movies. I'm not going to get dressed up in Klingon garb or some other BS for a convention, but I did enjoy the show and see the movies on VHS or in a theater.Here's the thing....there certainly is a devoted group of Trek fans who will NEVER be satisfied with anything but an exact recreation of the original. Heck, one guy on here wrote a review ripping the movie for callously violating the prime directive, invoking God, etc. These type of people....are morons. Yes, Star Trek occasionally told some culturally relevant tales, but it was, at it's core, still just a TV show and, for every great episode full of morality, it had it's episodes with scantily clad women or clunkers that were meant to do nothing more than try and boost ratings (or were just lazy efforts). And for the ""it's not Trek because it's a big budget mainstream flick"", well yeah, and guess what, the original Trek went there too in it's very first effort (The Motion Picture). And it failed so critically it nearly killed the franchise.The reason that film failed, Wrath of Khan & Into Darkness work, and also the reason moron Trekkie is an idiot, is that Star Trek is all about the CHARACTERS. Whatever the story, whatever the moral, it's the iconic characters of Kirk, Spock, McCoy et al who drive it. The Motion Picture spent, in it's day, a lot, but was all about special effects. Wrath of Khan not only had the stories, but it brought out the same characters that we'd seen in the series and it in the process revived the franchise.That's what J.J. Abrams has done best. The original series cast will always be the most beloved, but remember, they had 79 TV episodes together before the movies. This cast has only been together twice, yet they've recreated (and in their own ways put their own stamps) the same chemistry. And they get the viewer to care. The death scene (though a clear homage in many ways to Wrath of Khan) is amazing. Again, Nimoy and Shatner will never be topped as they originated the characters, but Pine and Quinto have the chemistry down and it is a very good piece of cinema.In many ways, Into Darkness is a mirror of Wrath of Khan. Wrath of Khan had themes of age, how do we deal with growing older or past our prime. After all, those characters were in their 50s by that point. In this film they're obviously younger and the theme is reversed, it's more about the aging and maturing into a man, into a leader. Some of called it an homage, others a remake. It's really more of a companion piece as these ""Wrath"" and ""Darkness"" are essentially separate sides of the same coin-in one we see these characters in the beginning of their development....in another we see them at the end. And yes, there are other contemporary themes woven into the plot in regards to terrorism, drone strikes, and the morality of how we react when we've been attacked. But the movie certainly also has all the loud noises and action that will attract the casual movie watcher.Now, it's not a deep pic or anything like that. It has it's holes and nitpicks. Though I'm a fan of the original series, I think sometimes they made a few too many references to the classic Trek (and truth be told they even had a reference to the Deep Space Nine series too). I mean, hasn't Shatner's ""KHAAANNNN!!!"" line been parodied or done enough? And to me, if there was one flaw, one thing that really could have been done to set this movie over the top, and into a really dark place, it would have been making the death permanent. That's what made Wrath of Khan such a big hit. When Spock died in that film it looked permanent, it felt real, and few movies to this day take that chance, especially considering how beloved the character was. At the time they did it because, after the bomb of the Motion Picture, there didn't figure to be many more Treks, if any. Of course, when the movie became a surprise hit and spawned more, they had to bring Spock back to keep making money (see Trekkies, even the original series people weren't that saintly that they didn't chase the almighty dollar). In many ways, that's the same case here. CLEARLY this rebooted Trek has more life after the way the first one performed and this one will, so killing off a central character for good would be a HUGE risk, and one they're not willing to take. But had they done it, and made it stick, it would have put this on a par with a Dark Knight or Godfather II type sequel.In any case, the flaws and nitpicks are minor compared to just how much fun you have watching this flick. In many ways you wish it were a TV show because you want to see another new adventure. Something the moron Trekkies almost fail to recognize, ironically, are some of Gene Roddenberry's (creator of the original series) last words before he passed away. He'd been interviewed and said he hoped over the years people would take Trek and reinvent it, not copy his vision to the letter, but put their own spin on it and keep it going in it's own contemporary time. Abrams really has done that while still keeping to what can make Star Trek fun and special.",Star Trek Into Darkness
1109,nemesis2998,good but a few mistakes,8,16 May 2013,there was two problems with this film other than that its was great 1st prob captain pike wasn't killed in the original series he was held captive and kirk rescued him 2nd in the original series Klingon's looked like us and not like the ones in the next gen as we all know it was said they got that way by a mutated virus which made them like that and when they took the masks off i was expecting them to look like us but i had a feeling they would make that mistake too. now its coming to the part of the 5 ear mission do you reckon they should do the series with those actors first should they go straight to the next gen personally i would like to see what more mistakes they make in the series lol. other than that i liked it 8 out of 10,Star Trek Into Darkness
1110,bobxxxj,Not For A Trek Fan,6,16 May 2013,"Been watching Star Trek since the original films were released in the 80's, I missed the original TV series & never really got into them but the movies captured my imagination more than any other sci-fi could. The TV series, Next Generation, Deep Space, Voyager built the Star Trek I know today. Why don't modern productions expand on that with so many great possibilities, species 8472, Borg in decline, dominion, war across the federation etc... etc.. which brings me to, Into Darkness.Spoiler ALERT !! Star Trek into Darkness is a re-imagining of Star Trek II - Wrath of Khan. Not a very good one if you follow Trek lore. There are parts of this movie that are visually pleasing & some character development that is a welcome change to the first movie but that accounts for the positive aspects.Problems with this movie: Scotty is the Jar Jar Binks of the new Star Trek. His character is basically a stand up comedian stumbling around the movie ruining the credibility of all the villains & climatic scenes in the movie. How the hell does Scotty manage to simply fly into the top secret ship without their sensors picking him up as an intruder. They do use sensors don't they? How is he able to freely roam the enemy ship with the top brass of Starfleet commanding?? Then he powers down their power systems with no one on board having a clue, where is their chief engineer???? This whole sequence breaks the movie in my opinion. Very similar on the crapometer to the scene when 6yr old Anakin Skywalker jumps in the fighter & destroys a whole space station by sheer fluke in Phatom Menance. Action-Adventure turns to comedy.Kirk is portrayed as an essentially wreck less idiot that would never command a star ship in any other series. Not to mention he is rewarded for his stupidity. He is lacking any of the requirements of an actual captain in starfleet in terms of decision making & maturity. If his rank were ensign he would be kicked out of Starfleet for the ideas he comes up with but in the movie he is rewarded over & over again. The one moment that can make this movie, the scene where he dies saving the crew which is carbon copy of ST2 but is reversed (Spock dies in that one) the emotional connection is there...that is until Bones has a sudden inspirational moment minutes before the movie ends & ends up saving Kirk.. boom movie is just typical happy ending garbage.. lets warp to the next dodgy adventure!! Spock's character also destroys his own back story completely by showing emotions throughout the movie. He gets angry, he still has a girlfriend despite his so called-lack of emotions which in itself is down right crazy (Girlfriends demand emotions!). Spock also contacts his other self from the original universe to break the temporal prime directive, how logical!!!!!!!!!!!! I accept this movie as an alternate timeline flirt but it could have easily been made as a 2 part episode in any of the TV series and barely worth making a movie out of it.If this is the best that can be created for 180 million, JJ Abrams will be better suited to making Star Wars movies, at least all those wacky ideas can fit into that universe better than the trek one. Star Trek was never meant to be an illogical-Transformer'ish action ride mixed with stupid humor for a wide audience. It is meant for true sci-fi fans.It would only take some smart editing to change this movie to make it solid for trek fans but it's the directors overall vision will hamper any proper revival of Star Trek in my eyes. He has the wrong vision.",Star Trek Into Darkness
1111,davide-verotta,Embarrassing,1,16 May 2013,"Probably one of the worst Star Trek Movie ever. As much as the previous Abrams movie was fun, creative and rejuvenated the franchise, this one is dull, with an unrealistic plot and looks like a mix of a bad Star Wars and any of a hundred cliché super hero movies.It starts with a frantic and jugged pace, that has the only purpose of providing the thin emotional theme of the story (what it means to be friends, one guesses) and then takes us into the movie proper that settles down at a more regular pace.The movie proper is a ton of explosions and chases and hand combat alternating with close ups displaying teary feelings. The unrelenting amount of video-game action seems to completely ignore the premises of the franchise (humanity sense of wonder, best qualities, and love of exploration). Amazingly, the tears on the cheeks do look like computer animations, and so do the emotions that such tears punctuate with alarming regularity.The plot? There is almost none, besides destruction on a grand scale at the hands of a villain who is upset at the Federation, and a huge number of unrealistic twists and turns that go from the absurdity of a space ship apparently without any security (you can just walk in, and access its most vital functions), to minor scenes such as when Kirk looks overwhelmed by the sight of Alice Eve wearing a sporty, almost Victorian Age, two pieces undergarment. A scene so obviously targeted to juvenile audience (in 2013?) and to the PG13 rating that is embarrassing, indeed like the movie.",Star Trek Into Darkness

But it's NOT Star Trek If you know & care about the original story line, forget it. J.J. Abrams appeared on The Daily Show & said that he hadn't liked Star Trek as a kid. It really showed. He changed all the old story lines. The flow of history is totally different, with no way to logically fit the stuff together. I'm so disappointed. What's up with Spock & Uhura? And we know that that's not what happened to Christopher Pike! The history of Vulcan -- what? The role reversal between Kirk & Spock? And future Spock? But the whole Khan thing is SO different from the original histories, & he is played so differently. Why is Carol Marcus there & why is she British? And really, all of the characters are just caricatures of how they were originally played. Abrams said he studied up on the old stuff, but he didn't get it. Boo! Hiss! I wonder how Abrams will screw up Star Wars next.",Star Trek Into Darkness
1113,orionsagan,I strongly recommend Star Trek Into Darkness,10,16 May 2013,"This movie was excellent homage to a part of the old Star Trek. As it turns out, the character of John Harrison is in reality Khan Noonian Singh. The name John Harrison was an alias for the villain of this movie. I also noticed that the character of Admiral Marcus was itching for a war with the Klingons and he reminded me of the Military Industrial Complex. There was a reverse where Kirk instead of Spock went into the radioactive room to save the ship and Spock yelled ""KHAAAAAAAN!"" Khan hijacked Marcus' flagship and crashed it into San Francisco. This movie was quite interesting. For the first time, Khan reminds me of my most hated science fiction movie, Titan AE.",Star Trek Into Darkness

I am a life long Trekkie and have seen other life longer's very upset on how Abrams has reinvented Trek but I for one am very impressed. Two movies now with two amazing stories behind them. Yes both films have way more action than all the previous films but what's wrong with that? As Trekkie's we should be happy we still have Trek around and that there is a man who was smart enough to find a way to reinvent it instead of a Rick Berman running it into the ground! Now my children are getting into Star Trek just like I did. Anyways this new film is great!Great effects with a great story and the Enterprise is beautiful as ever! GO SEE THIS MOVIE! You will not be disappointed.,Star Trek Into Darkness
1116,jdceditor,"Too much tampering, but a great film regardless",8,18 May 2013,"I've enjoyed the last two movies considerably, but some changes seem just for the sake of it, and some just grate.For a start, the bridge and most of the ship are pleasing enough, but the engine room is less believable than the original series, much of it looking like it's shot in a gasworks or something, and it seems far too large for the vessel it's in.The transporter effect is dreadful, even the very coarse shimmer effect from the first series has more charm than this. Most certainly I regard the phaser from the original series as being one of the best designed props ever made. Every movie and series since has tried to improve on it, and has failed. Another change for no good end.Even the textured and tarted up uniforms don't make it for me. And what on earth have they done to the Klingons? Truly pointless. Changing something just because it's a reboot isn't a good enough reason.But even seeing past these things, the current universe they inhabit (and I know it's supposed to be a parallel one) has done away with many aspects of accepted Trek lore for no good reason. Why was Vulcan destroyed? Kirk did not just have to obey the prime directive, he wrote it, which was not mentioned. Kirk discovers Khan much later in life and in different circumstances, and why oh why was an Indian dictator blue-eyed and white? That's not just wrong, but ridiculous.A wonderful film, but I think the next one needs to take them back into their own universe and time line. Ignoring established events in the Trek universe is beyond a mistake, it's an insult.In conclusion, a must-see (especially in 3D) but needs to get back to its roots.",Star Trek Into Darkness
1117,dan-688-348058,A joke on Star Treck,1,18 May 2013,"Yet another 3dFirst of all, I do not care about graphics. Graphics are not the reason I watch a film. I rather enjoy a good story, consistency, engaging action, drama, a nice plot - none of witch the subject in hand has.Story:Well, if you know Wrath of Khan, then do not bother, just imagine Spock instead of Kirk.Engaging action:Wile there was action, plenty, I was struggling to see reason - this makes it non engaging. It does not matter that they are in trouble running from indigenous people if they should of not been there in the first place, nor Enterprise under water, nor Kirk on the Kronos planet fighting inconsistent looking Clingons! DramaKirk in Spock running in the woods in opening scene - why?Prime directive trashed for no good reason - huh?Spock relationship issues during mission - really?Kirk revived by Khan blood - no one saw that coming?Big/mean Enterprise is faster and more powerful that small/peaceful Enterprise - oh no!Kirk and Khan are buddies (temporary).Plot:Still unclear who wanted to do what.Slow, predictable, dialog really lame (school like)Khan never reveal his ultimate goal.Kirk was pretty much a dice (remember his captain of Enterprise) - slightly constant was his need for mindless vengeance - nice touch.The only one actual important element to the story came in the form of a paranoid admiral that wants to fight Clingons in a improbable vessel.In the end it all proves that Kirk is nothing more that incredibly stupid, vengeance indulging, risk freak Enterprise CAPTAIN - we all like that don't we?. And there are 72 more reasons in form of ""manned"" photon torpedoes - OK, so that is more easy to do then to just kill them - sure I got it.Consistency:Lately, warp drive creates magic dust.Clingons had collectively changed as a race.Enterprise can swim.Cardasian beverages can travel time.Kronos planet has no defenses.If this would of been shoes, I would of taken them back to the store and ask for my money back!

I thought The movie was ""AWESOME""! To say the least. It was so good that I'm on here writing a review, which I never do. It's so good that my 9 year old sat still through the whole movie. Which he never does. We also recently watched Iron Man 3 and GI Joe and in his own words he said "" I like Star Trek way better mom"". This reminded me of when I watched Star Wars with my parents when I was little. It was something I will never forget. My son and I had that moment . One I know he will look back on. What I'm saying people is it is one of those movies that can make you a fan for life. I too grew up on Star Wars & Star Trek. From one ""OG"" to a Noob(ie) today I just passed the torch forward =). Just go and watch the movie and see for yourself! Yes I know,we all have our own opinions in life and you can can't please everyone. I just happen to be the one who was Very Pleased =)And stop comparing this to the original series and movies. This is a Prequel. 2 totally different things.

This is a film in which the last scene should have been the first. Instead the scene is used as an apology and promises it will do the right thing next time. It suggests that order has been reinstated and it will be boldly going somewhere next time. By why not this time? why was it necessary to pick the skeleton of a million other action movies and turn Star Treck into a predictable good guy discovers treachery inside the firm movie. A thousand plots on the banking system would have made a better story than this. Why does the crew of the Enterprise go around shooting like they are LA cops and why does Spock has to have an action sequence when a simple grip of the upper shoulder has always been adequate to maintain his superior power. Meddling with the DNA of any brand is a dangerous avenue and when seemingly intelligent decision makers see it fit to use 9/11 as an appropriate way to provoke sentimentality or even attempting to Americanize the context of Enterprise then you know that these guys can only ever look for ideas up their own asses, because clearly their brains are devoid of intelligent thought.",Star Trek Into Darkness

""too much action"" i have found myself at when i watched the 09 movie saying this but after consideration this is not so much of a big deal now would i want a balance of terror type star trek movie sure id love it but it wouldn't sell as they are two different generations balance of terror people had games like battleship now we have games like cod and halo 2. ""Abrams ruined star trek"" this one's confounding as i love the idea of a alternate universe lets face it star trek can only go so far in the future before it gets silly he has breathed new life in trek and if you don't like where he's going watch st IV on a nuclear vessel 3 ""nonsensical plot"" i don't know about you but the plot i found was very consistent with trek lore and the new alt universe in fact more so than 09 now for the review cumberbatch gives an amazing performance as john Harrison and Alice eve a solid performance as carol Marcus ,as always the crew of the enterprise does a stellar job as with last go round the effects are awesome and this time they do bump up most of the crews roles so its not a kirk Spock male romance this time thought they do still get a lot of screen time scotty gets his shots in and urban i think did a better job as bones though i am a bit partial as bones was my favorite character and Uhura becomes the latest in a line of strong recent cinema female characters joining Gwyneth Paltrow as Pepper Potts as i said with the plot very consistent with trek lore and fitting with the new alt universe action was well paced and looked great and abrams even threw in a rather furry reference for tos fans the future looks very bright for star trek if abrams keeps this up",Star Trek Into Darkness
1123,renilicious,Accessible for all! Fun and enjoyable.,9,19 May 2013,"Right off the bat, if you're reading this review to find bitter complaints from an equally-as-bitter fan, you won't find them here.I loved the film! What I saw, and thoroughly enjoyed, was a resurgence of the quirky series of Star Trek, Next Gen, and DS9. To be honest, I thought the franchise was ruined with that awful Voyager series and was only vaguely revived with the short-lived Enterprise.Star Trek has NEVER been a serious franchise. Ever. It has always had an underlying feeling of cheesiness and quirk - that is what I have always enjoyed about it.It's space and science fiction and adventure. If I want serious aliens, I'll watch Alien! Now... the movie itself, again, it was brilliantly cast. Simon Pegg is a stand-out character this time around, brilliant as Scotty and gets all the best lines of the entire film. Chris Pine as Kirk is still the sex-mad hot head that he always was in the original series. Spock (Zachary Quinto) is still infuriatingly logical and rule-driven. Bones (Karl Urban) is still as grouchy as ever he was. The young Khan/Harrison is played to perfection by Benedict Cumberbatch - the man does the cryptic evil dude very, very well and his voice oozes malice. A perfect choice as far as I am concerned.It's my feeling that JJ Abrams has kept to the Star Trek cannon as much as possible while bringing the back story of these characters to life as well as also trying to appeal to the new fans of the franchise.The film may have been a little heavy on the action scenes at times however they were all enjoyable. Probably the only scene that I thought was tedious but a necessary evil was the crew's adventure to Kronos. It was too obvious for a Klingon ""patrol"" ship to be floating around an area that's completely uninhabited except for ONE life form - that of Khan - when our heroes show up to do Star Fleet's dirty work. I feel that could have been done much better in a different way.Overall, however, I thoroughly enjoyed it a heck of a lot more than I thought I would. I've been dragged kicking and screaming into the franchise because I am surrounded by Trekkies (married to one, parents are, etc, etc) so I've learned to like much of it. As someone who is familiar with the cannon, I was not disappointed.",Star Trek Into Darkness

1125,foxrock66,"Lots of fun, but a tad too familiar",7,19 May 2013,"Star Trek : Into Darkness""You are a pawn, Kirk. You can't even guarantee the safety of your own crew.""There's no denying 2013 is a good year to be a sci-fi fan. Offerings like Oblivion, After Earth, Pacific Rim, and Riddick all promise to keep fans of the genre quite happy. However, it's J.J. Abrams' sequel to his masterful 2009 Star Trek reboot that is arguably the most anticipated release of the year, and rightfully so. The 2009 film was an accomplishment; successfully modernizing the series while remaining decidedly true to what Star Trek is expected to be. Now, four years later, does the sequel, ""Into Darkness"" live up to its' predecessor?That all depends on what sort of film you want to see.If you're all in for an action-filled, gut-wrenching adventure featuring the cast and characters you love from the reboot, then this is the movie for you. The sound design is some of the best I've experienced in recent memory. From photon blasts to screeching metal to warp drives, it's unbelievably immersive. Jarring, subtle, soothing, adrenaline inducing, loud, it's what sound in a film like this should be. Everything – even simple punches – have a weight and realness to them that is often overlooked in films.This beauty extends to the musical score as well. Haunting melodies and rising crescendos are superbly placed to manipulate the mood to exactly what the viewer needs to feel at the time, whether that be wonder, dread, or excitement.The returning cast members – from Pine to Urban to Quinto to Pegg to the superb Bruce Greenwood - are every bit what they were in Star Trek 2009, and have arguably improved in their roles. Quinto's Spock has noticeably grown, as has Urban's Bones McCoy. Pine's Kirk is a less explicit progression, but has successfully shaken some of the annoying frat-boy persona he exhibited in Trek 2009, which in itself is an accomplishment I can applaud.The new cast members serve their roles for the most part – minus Alice Eve, who seems perfectly content to act as a hollow shell placed in the film to be nothing but eye candy. Benedict Cumberbatch's Khan, on the other hand, is a force to be reckoned with; Vastly superior to 1982's Khan – played by Ricardo Montalban, this new Khan is a sight to behold. Equally menacing and relatable, there were many instances in the film that I truly felt for him and thought he was justified in his villainous actions. Cumberbatch's brooding, emotional portrayal is one the better characters in the series history, and I can only hope he'll somehow be used again in the future. As engaging as he was, the final turn-about of his character arc was sadly predictable.That is where we come to the bulk of what is wrong with ""Into Darkness""For all its victories, the film was almost too familiar for a returning fan like myself. It leans on its source material – 1982's aforementioned ""The Wrath of Khan"" – like an ugly crutch, all too often borrowing plot points and twists in unneeded ways. 2009's reboot also did this, but in a far less greedy way, and ultimately managed to be original and surprising. ""Into Darkness"" does not succeed in this regard. While the story is serviceable; if you're an old fan, chances are you've seen a lot of it before. This means many of the scenes meant to evoke shock or suspense may ring hollow, because you already know the outcome.On occasion, Abrams has an inspired stroke, and instead of lifting a plot point, turns it on its head and gives us a legitimate twist that we can appreciate, but too often he eschews this in favor of trying to play to our nostalgia. I was much more impressed with Oblivion's story line and unique ideas than I was with the script of ""Into Darkness"", which is rather sad. Star Trek has always been more of a thinking- man's sci-fi, but this new film falls squarely in the action/thriller department. If you're looking for a good thought-provoking romp through the future, I recommend Oblivion.Overall, ""Into Darkness"" is lacking in comparison to its older brother - and it seems to its competition this year as well. I will give credit to its final act, which was superbly engaging and had a pair of wonderfully executed twists – though they may be lost on newcomers to the series.The film is lots of fun, and if your introduction to the universe was the 2009 Trek, then you will likely be perfectly satisfied with this merely adequate sequel, but if you're a veteran of the world, you may be a tad disappointed.In closing, I cannot help but feel let down. Into Darkness was engaging while it lasted and had plenty of great moments. The humor was frequent enough that it prevented things from ever becoming too dark, while also keeping it's distance during the most dire of situations; and as previously stated the final act of the film was a superb ride.Yet, there are so many little things that while competent, were not astounding. So much potential literally brimming around the surface of the display, but never being fully realized. Does it deserve a place in your collection? Yes, though perhaps not on your ""classics"" shelf. ""Into Darkness"" will find itself much more comfortable alongside contemporaries like Prometheus or Terminator : Salvation.E. C. Cook 20137.5/10",Star Trek Into Darkness
1126,bkbraids,Cumberbatch is no Khan,2,19 May 2013,"The movie Into The Darkness is a travesty of the Trek Legacy - Khan is Cumberbatch? This is a kick in the face to Star Trek fans!!! WHAT WERE THEY THINKING? As a girl growing up - Ricardo Montalbán was the object of dreamy affections. I'm sure there were many of us. His appearance in The original Star Trek series (STOS) was when I first saw him and when he returned in his masterful performance in Wrath of Khan - he made the movie! I can't believe with all the care and thought that went into casting the current Star Trek crew - they picked Benedict Cumberbatch as Khan? I think he's great in Sherlock - but as Khan? Are you kidding me? How about Javier Bardem - he would have been fabulous! Khan wasn't just a a vicious terrorist - he was a charismatic leader of his people. Cumberbatch's Khan is a one dimensional terrorist and lacked the alluring charm and veiled threat that Ricardo brought to the role.The movie was great - until Benedict says ""I am KHAN""! WHAT? After a Scooby Doo moment - the movie lost me and started to make me mad.",Star Trek Into Darkness
1127,fjsalazar,Riffing on the Classic Chemistry,8,19 May 2013,"Face it, the great strength of Star Trek has always been the ensemble of characters. Yes, the show and movies in its many incarnations have taken on many social and political themes, and seen many popular culture firsts. But we're here to see Kirk and Spock, aided and abetted by the rest of Team Enterprise, tackle the universe head on wielding their main weapons of raised eyebrows and galactic overacting.From that perspective, ST:Into Darkness does not disappoint. Pine and Quinto have relaxed more into their roles and are much more believable in the 2nd installment of the rebooted franchise. After you see it, you may wish there was more to do for McCoy (Karl Urban) and especially Chekov (Anton Yelchin) who pretty much spends the film staring perplexedly at a non-functional warp core. Zoe Saldana as Uhura gets a good slice of screen-time, but let's just say her knowledge of Klingon psychology needs improvement.As for Benedict Cumberbatch and the plot ... well, let's not over think things. JJ Abrams clearly didn't -- he focused on the interplay of character and action, with a hint of heavy handed but real-American social consciousness. And that's the Star Trek formula, right? Plus, the numerous quotations from TOS and the classic films, while a bit predictable, are just great to see. You will cry and you will laugh.Wrap up: If you are already a fan, Into Darkness gives you A+ classic character chemistry and a B+ plot -- it's a must-see. If you are not a fan, see it: I guarantee your next stop will be NetFlix or Hulu to see what the source material was like.",Star Trek Into Darkness
1128,cruella6235,Star Trek: Into Darkness - Review from a Non-Trekkie :),10,19 May 2013,"I appreciate J.J Abrams and his vision for the new Star Trek movies (and hopefully it will become a trilogy). I am not a Trekkie by any means, but J.J has shown me how to appreciate Star Trek and its' characters :) Into Darkness is probably one of the best sequels to any film I've ever seen. Most sequels are just money-makers and usually not that great, but Into Darkness (in my opinion) is just as good as 2009's Star Trek. And the addition of Benedict Cumberbatch was a genius move.My reasons: (without spoilers) Captain James. T Kirk begins to learn what it truly means to be a captain. He's still very young and arrogant and he thinks that the rules do not apply to him. As a captain, he must learn what it means to make mistakes and learn from them when luck can no longer assist him.Especially when revenge in involved. From both Kirk and the villain.This movie had me and my four friends (all Geek girls, mind you, with no boyfriends) on the edge of our seats the entire time. This film had the perfect combination of humor, action and drama that would honestly keep anyone - Trekkie or non-Trekkie - excited.I won't spoil too much, but I think that this movie is beyond enjoyable. I will definitely see it again and purchase the DVD when it comes out. I have already gone to see it twice and I want to go again. I applaud J.J Abrams for his vision for his Star Trek series and I hope for another sequel, making it a complete trilogy.Honestly, my opinion, stay away from critics and reviews, since they will ALWAYS have something negative to say about this movie. Of course Into Darkness is going to upset the Trekkies and they won't see it, because it's not ""accurate"".Forget about it. Go see the movie for yourself. It really is an amazing movie. I give Into Darkness 9/10.",Star Trek Into Darkness
1129,aidanh99-690-634214,Amazing!,10,20 May 2013,May contain spoilers!There were many great things about this reboot. First off it had a great plot (a bit predictable but not by that much to hurt it) critics and people who CLEARLY have not watched much Star Trek say that it has too many plot holes but maybe if they paid attention to that this movie series is based in a alternate time line and not set on the same time line as TOS/TNG. It incorporated lines from wrath of khan but was not parodying it as many critics of the movie have been saying. Because the Star Trek franchise was in hibernation they needed to appeal to a wider audience to keep it afloat this may have taken a hit on star fleets diplomacy and ask questions first shoot latter but the new style of action has done the franchise well Please ignore the critics and harsh reviewers and GO WATCH THIS MOVIE,Star Trek Into Darkness
1130,parrotgirly,I truly enjoyed the movie,9,19 May 2013,"I won't go into details of the movie, since many have already disassembled the plot lines and synopsis. I truly enjoyed the reflection of old bonds and the introduction of new ones. The relationship between Kirk and Spock and the introduction of the new villain were fantastic. I have watched the series in the 60's and then the movies as they came out in the 1970's. There were fantastic ones (Wrath of Khan)and some not so good(come on....ST IV?). I found this franchise to be a refreshing introduction of the original franchise with some wonderful additions. I enjoy the banter and development of the characters. I hope that JJ Abrams continues with the story. Yes, there are discrepancies from the old stories, but isn't that what an alternate universe is supposed to be? Go see it.",Star Trek Into Darkness
1131,jackrdunn,"Very Good, but flawed.",8,19 May 2013,"Overall I liked Into Darkness but it did have some major flaws (SPOILER ALERT). First, Star Trek is about a utopian future, and this version is all dystopian. We are supposed to be able to trust the values and the leadership of Starfleet. Second, what's with the cheap ugly warehouse/oil refinery style sets that make up the guts of JJ Abrams' Enterprise? They look like he was too poor or too lazy to design real starship sets. The inside of starship should not look like inside of a Costco. Where are the bulkheads? Third, what's up with the blinding halogen lights on the bridge of the enterprise? Previous versions of Star Trek have used the bridges and combat control centers of Navy ships and subs as models for their Enterprise bridges. This Enterprise bridge looks like a Beverly Hills hair salon. Fourth, what's up with the stupid re-imagining of the Klingons? Abrams was true to the Vulcans, but the new Klingons look small, silly, and undignified - not things one usually associates with Klingons. Fifth, what's up with casting Benedict Cumberbatch as Khan Noonien Singh. In one scene Khan is shown being led to the brig with Enterprise security towering over him. He's supposed to be stronger than normal humans but Benedict is totally unconvincing. When Ricardo Montalbán played Singh he was tall, powerful, imposing physically, charismatic and very convincing as a superior specimen. Cumberbatch has the passion, but none of the charisma, none of the physical presence that Montalbán had. In the end he suffers from the same weaknesses of Abrams previous Star Trek villain, he just isn't memorable.",Star Trek Into Darkness
1132,purchasing-690-745224,Didn't make it for me,3,20 May 2013,"I have been watching Star Trek since the 1960's. Abrams went boldly down the wrong path with Into Darkness. While I fully realize that this is a new Star Trek franchise, and I did like the 2009 reboot, this one didn't cut for me. The opening scene was ridiculously lame and nonsensical. Planetary orbit and transporters were abandoned in favor of turning the Enterprise into a submarine (like the planet inhabitants wouldn't have seen THAT when they went underwater) and using a ""cold fusion"" device to create cold when in fact REAL cold fusion creates heat, not cold. The non-action scenes were fairly well done, in fact they are the only reason I wasn't completely bored with the movie and why I gave it a 3. I was expecting much, much more from Cumberbatch, but I found his performance to be robotic, dispassionate, and just downright not creepy enough. The best scene he had in the entire movie was his encounter with the Kingons, but other than that he was pretty blah. The action scenes were either too predictable or upscaled, blatant ripoffs from previous ST movies such as Nemesis. The gratuitous profanity was neither needed nor appreciated and actually detracted from the dialogue. The scenes of Alice Eve in her undies and the one with Nimoy could have been left out as they added nothing. If you have seen Wrath of Khan, the scene of Kirk in the radiation chamber will make you absolutely cringe. Overall, the movie simply lacked the edge, passion, and creative thinking needed to recreate the Khan story.",Star Trek Into Darkness
1133,vulzeta,"Superb, Great Film!!!",10,20 May 2013,"I thought this movie was terrific and was re-invented to draw in a new fan base, that didn't particularly connect with the old ""Star Trek"" or were just too young to even know about it. Like me having been forced to watch the series back in the l960s with my brother's; I can't for the life of me understand what was so great about the old star trek in the first place.I think J.J. Abrams is a brilliant director and really delivered a great movie with all the action that the old ""Star Trek"" lacked. Had he done it with no action like the old ones; no one, would have liked it. I loved it and really understood it. As for the old timers considered ""Trekkies"" they are the only ones who will not like it; partly because they are just ""Stuck in the 60s"". I am now a new ""Star Trek"" fan, and hope he does more sequels. Everyone out there should give this film a chance!!",Star Trek Into Darkness
1134,fish1534,"The movie got Trek cannon wrong, got basic 21st century science wrong and in no way contributed to Gene Roddenberry's dream of a better world",2,20 May 2013,"The film was horrible.With that said I'll start with the good. Karl Urban's Dr. McCoy was the one shining star in the film. His deadpan line, ""He'd let you die Jim"" was perfect. It showed the struggle between compassion and logic that was so well portrayed by Kelly and Nimoy in the original series. First, the film completely disregards Star Trek cannon. Christopher Pike does not live through the movie to end up as a quadriplegic on Talos IV. The Klingon home world, Kronos, appears to have a moon, Praxis, that has exploded, except this doesn't happen until Star Trek VI. All this is forgivable however; new movies for a new generation that knows nothing about Star TrekSecond, what isn't forgivable is that basic Newtonian physics and science is so poorly understood by the film makers that it distracts from the movie. Some examples of plainly not understand that the world around you is governed by science and not magic are: the heat from the volcano is attributed to damaging shuttle craft Galileo yet the heat caused by de-orbiting the shuttle craft would far exceed any heat caused by a volcano. In the same sequence, the Enterprise is parked underwater. Are we to believe that a star ship that must be constructed in space and is designed to be used for interstellar travel also doubles as a submarine? When was the last time that you boarded a 747 to go on an undersea adventure? And why in the hell would they park the Enterprise underwater when they could be invisible in orbit directly above the volcano and use sensors and transporters? Other big issues are that the crew of the starship Enterprise does not know the distance of the moon's orbit. Ask Neil Armstrong, I bet he figured it out 300 years earlier. I think the first question on starship helmsman's exam should be, ""Where is the moon and so you don't hit it?"" Next when the ship can no longer hold orbit, it falls back to earth in a few minutes like a stone dropped into a pond. Newton? Never heard of him! What laws of motion? I think movies reflect a lot upon a generation. This new generation claims nerds are cool, but has no manned space program. Your parents' generation actually walked on the moon.Third, when the script however fails to make common sense, it throws you outside the movie and this makes the movie 'unfun'. After a secure, secret Starfleet facility is attacked, Starfleet Command decides to meet in an unprotected high rise. I guess in the 23rd century, rank isn't correlated with intelligence or experience. Next, the Klingons are a war like race equally as advanced as humans that have developed space travel but they don't bother to guard their entire home world. They actually sound pretty easy to conquer. That's okay because humans are just as dumb; two Federation ships appear in earth orbit to duke it out and there are no other Federation ships around. Please, will one ship randomly fall on San Francisco? We sound pretty easy to conquer too. Let's not forget about the unnecessary, obligatory, giant tittied girl in skimpy underwear to make all the 14 year old boys have happy wet dreams. I love nude women as much as the next guy but porn has it's time and place and this wasn't it Unless you are a 14 year old boy with $10.50 for a movie and no other access to porn.When Kirk died, why did Dr. McCoy need Kahn's blood to save him? He had 72 genetically engineered humans from the eugenics war frozen in front of him. The Eugenics Wars are well documented. He actually had to thaw one of those guys out to put Kirk in the life support tube. Why not use his blood or one of the other 71 samples of super blood?Fourth, I remember when Spock died in Star Trek II, people cried, it was debated if he could really be dead. It was an emotional heartfelt moment that asked the audience to way, ""the needs of the many, versus the needs of the few."" Did anyone really think Jim was dead in this movie? He was dead for all of five minutes! It was a completely wasted scene because it was devoid of emotional connection. I believe it was 30 seconds wedged in the middle of two action sequences. This may be because modern movie audiences lack the social skills such as empathy which are necessary for bonding with others. So the film makers simply recreate a scene from the past devoid of emotion and the audience believes it has the received the same spellbinding moment that their parents received.The only emotion portrayed in the whole film is the Caulfield like teenage angst of Captain Kirk. Great men are no longer portrayed as being challenged with great responsibility or moral questions but now face the pubescent problems of spoiled teenagers. This is the greatest reason why this new Star Trek movie fails. Gene Roddenberry created a future where men had moved beyond many of humanities vices. He created a series of moral plays in his ""Wagon train to the sky""; the original series is more like twilight zone episodes than anything else. Where in this movie did you feel good about humanity? Did this movie make you feel like we could end the Iraq War? That's how the old series made you feel about Vietnam and the Cold War. Did it make you feel that bigotry toward gays would end? That's how the original series made you feel about racism. The movie is an epic fail that reflects a generation that is an epic failure.",Star Trek Into Darkness

There were a few scenes that try to call back to previous Star Trek movies, and one in particularly is howlingly bad. I actually laughed in the middle of the theater when the big emotional climax of the movie was happening because it just was so cheesy compared to its inspiration. There are plot holes galore. No need for me to go into detail on them but needless to say some of the things that happen in this movie are just stupid and make no sense. Without giving anything away, it seems that both Starfleet and the Klingons have very lax security protocols because people keep sneaking into places way too easily. Also, while I love the look of the Enterprise and its bridge, the overall production design doesn't give a sense that all these places that supposedly are on the same ship, are actually, you know, on the same ship. Engineering is this gigantic open vaguely industrial space, with nothing in common with the design of the bridge or hallways. Nobody walks from a hallway, through a door and into engineering. They go through a hallway and then after a cut they're in engineering. I'm all for giving the innards of the ship a more industrial or lived-in feel but they just don't feel like they're actually on the ship. The warp core is yet another room with lots of metal and dangly wires, with essentially two giant spark plugs in the middle. At one point, a character has to kick one of these spark plugs back into place! I could go on, but yeah, it'd be a dissertation. Overall it's a mostly fun movie with some fun homages to Star Trek of old, great effects & music. But try not to think about it too hard or you'll end up irritated, like me.",Star Trek Into Darkness

Any conflict or fight activities that's happening in the Star Fleet's space, especially over the Earth's space which is very strict area and high securities. There should be some very efficiently security system or high protection by the Fleet, but it seems there are just the Enterprise with Khan's battleship, I knew it's possible that the Khan's ship is the most advance one over the others but it's not possible he can fight alone with large fleet's that patrolling around the Earth's space.This is the same point of the 1st part, when Romulan (came through the black hole 25 years ago) can harm to Valcan's planet, as the Valcan has the most advance technology, are there any Valcan's fleet protecting the area? Don't tell that because Valcan is peaceful enough which is not necessary to have any guarding fleet for them self.

1139,delicasso,Major Credibility Gaps with Good Special Effects,5,21 May 2013,"This movie, like it's predecessor, had major credibility gaps. While it was easier to let them slide in the last movie as they needed to rewrite history in order to reboot, this time it's far less excusable. I know it's sci-fi, but the Star-Trek franchise has a certain integrity that was totally ""warped"" in this movie. Spoiler alert: Don't read on unless you don't mind having the plot spoiled a bit or a lot: (1) How could the federation build a spaceship in a few years that was many times faster, better shields, and could seriously out-gun the ""flagship"" of fleet - the enterprise. Was Khan, a relic in time and technology, able to inspire that much? Maybe they should research the genetic testing experiments that created him, and see if they can build the better intellect without the Psychotic emotional issues? (2) Using a small suitcase sized transporter to go from one plant to another, light years away? Sounds like an excellent way to attack, but totally unacceptable. (3) A torpedo that could be launched from the edge of the 'Klingon' neutral zone and accurately hit a target on the planet? (4) Have an emergency high level 'military' meeting in a downtown high-rise with no military support or surveillance? (5) Why would a star fleet officer detonate a bomb and kill thousands - just to save his daughter? Did Khan use the dark side of the force on him (oh wait, that the next movie that JJ Abrams is going to direct). (6) Are we to believe that this 'evil' guy is really a younger Ricardo Montalban. Where did the accent go? (7) Khan's ship had no guidance system but he managed to get it to run in to San Francisco? (8) The admirals daughter saw her dad's head smashed in. Why wasn't she is massive shock? And couldn't the writers have brought him back alive to be punished. That would be more consistent with the star-trek morality. (9) So you could build a photon torpedo with enough room to put someone inside it, and yet yet still be able to blow it up? Seems like a major waste of space. Where does the 'explosive' go? (10) Using Khan's blood to save the captain. What kind of morality issues that that bring up, and what side effects? The list goes on... Enjoy.",Star Trek Into Darkness

1141,russ-692-838456,Open-Minded Non-Trekky Unimpressed by this Mess,2,22 May 2013,"I am not going to mention Star Trek itself a lot in this review but rather talk about what I saw in terms of how good a movie it is in general and whether it is worth going to see it.It isn't worth it.Seriously I'm not going to judge all of Star Trek by this extremely awful movie but if I did I would be forced to conclude that it is utter garbage. For a start who is this movie actually for? It's not impossible to include decent dialog in the action genre (as seen in Iron Man) so why has this been written solely for unimaginative children? I haven't even written any reviews on IMDb before despite being a die-hard movie lover but I just have to warn people – pay for this and you're going to regret parting with your money.If you have no attention span and can see it for free you may at least enjoy the video game effects. I did, and to be honest I'm too lazy to play video games. That's why I've given it 2 stars. Other reviewers have said the effects aren't that good but the 3D is obviously quite well done in places.The worst thing about this film (apart from the acting which is woeful) is that if you're unfamiliar with the general Star Trek narrative it's easy to assume that the pathetic attempts at interactions between these 'characters' are nothing but simplistic portrayals of the 'goody' / 'baddy' dynamics in kindergarten nursery rhymes. While these rhymes have their place (namely child-care centers) a 38 year old father like me who's forked out $30 for the Gold Class 3D version now expects some kind of 'reverse-ratings' system to warn me to keep well clear of such trash in the future.Other reviews have delved into the actual 'plot' in a way I am unable to but it surprises me just how astonishingly bad the writing has been in this and Prometheus by Damon Lindelof who's work I enjoyed massively on Lost. I'm never going to enjoy his success even though I dabble with writing but it has obviously gone to his head.I found myself emotionless and bored throughout this movie which has nothing in common with good science fiction pieces from the recent-past such as Event Horizon or even newer works such as Sunshine by Danny Boyle.If I were a Star Trek fan I would be affronted by this rubbish which, personally, I find myself being unable to give only 1 star only due to 'flashing-of-cash' special effects which may be boldly going somewhere but not anywhere – well – special.However, remove the nice graphics and some of the action sequences, and you are left with nothing but a straight-to-video, 'Worst 10 Films of All Time' TV show contender which bored my socks off and made me question whether it's even worth actually paying to go and see any Hollywood movies ever again.",Star Trek Into Darkness
1142,Chredd34,Well Done,8,22 May 2013,"OK people this is not the ORIGINAL TIMELINE so expect different things. I have seen all the movies, and episodes from every franchise of Star Trek. Yes this is a reboot of the Wrath of Khan, but its a different timeline do remember that. So let me answer some of the many complaints I have read on here.Yes Khan was played by a Hispanic in the original, and a British guy in this one, but he did a decent job. Why was the enterprise parked on the ocean floor instead of in orbit, don't know but why care. Why wasn't the bomb transported in the volcano, well if they could do that, then Spock would have been transported out, and what would they transport it onto without seeing, it would go into the lava. The film explained why Khan was found much earlier but I guess many missed it. He was found by Starfleet due to the back in time threat from the first movie, as Starfleet started looking for threats by going out further into space and found him.They reversed the roles of Spock and Kirk, and used some of the same dialogue, I didn't have a problem with it like some people do. I saw a lot of complaining with Kirk being demoted, like he never went through that for being reckless.Khan put his comrades in the missile's to keep the admiral from using them, as it was his only leverage against Khan. Everyone talks about the cryotube, and how Bones took a person out to put Kirk in. If they had cryotube's in Khan's time why wouldn't they have them in this time, and aboard the ship. Everyone assumes he took one of Khans comrade's tube, even though Bones already stated he couldn't do it without killing one. Doesn't anyone ever think when writing these reviews, other than just trying to tear the movie apart. For those who missed it Khan was put back into the cryotube.The reason Spock has so many emotional problems was due to his home planet being blown away and his mother being killed. He had his mother for most of his life in the original timeline, once again think past that. Bones could have had better lines, than just the rhetorical remarks.This is not the ORIGINAL TIMELINE die hard fans, when will you realize that. This is Kirk, Spock, Scotty, Uhura, Bones, Sulu, and Checkov when they were young, not the middle age crew you got in the original series. The timeline is altered due to the previous movie, so Kirk doesn't have his father, Spock doesn't have his mom, so things aren't the same, let it go.If you didn't like this movie, you either don't like the reboot cause your a die hard Star Trek fan or your just knit picking and can't think, plain and simple. I am by no means a JJ fan as he screwed up Transformers, but this movie was good.I liked it and will see it again.",Star Trek Into Darkness
1143,undsoft,Where's the morals?,5,23 May 2013,"What this story lacked is the moral fiber Next Generation has. The whole moral conflict is being contained in a tiny speech Kirk gives in the end of the movie. But where's the struggle, where's the dilemma? Basically the moral is that one shouldn't return evil for evil. Like we should try a criminal and give him a chance to defend himself before prosecuting, even if we are 99% sure that he's guilty (Hello, Osama). And that the very act of plain revenge dehumanizes us. There could have been a passionate conflict about all this. Kirk has the orders to execute Khan without a trial. Instead he chooses to capture him and prosecute. He makes the moral choice, but we don't really know why. Is it because Spock has successfully appealed to his reason? We don't know, they barely discuss this.Is Kirk now in opposition to the whole Starfleet risking war with Klingons just because he believes that moral grounds are more important than real politics? Probably not, because as we find out later its not really about Starfleet, it's about EVIL Admiral and his EVIL plans. No moral dilemmas here.Did Khan face the same moral choice (return evil with evil) and just made the other choice? We get a hint of that, but then, Spock-Nimoy resolves any moral problems here by letting us know that Khan is... well.. EVIL and cannot be changed.This way the whole movie turns into bland good vs. evil story with one antagonist being fascist and another one being power hungry militarist.When did Star Trek became Star Wars? :(--- P.S.

The saddest part about it all is that no one seems to care.

1147,adamreid-694-734167,Further proof of the 'Death of Craft',1,24 May 2013,"There comes a point in time in the life of any cinephile when you realize that the majority of films are being made and targeted towards a generation now younger than yourself. As depressing as this realization is, it becomes doubly demoralizing when you realize the demographic being targeted has the digital age attention span of someone badly in need of a Ritalin roofie. If you've seen the original Wrath of Khan film, it's virtually impossible not to hold this movie and the people who made it in contempt. This is a film utterly devoid of originality, creativity and soul. The shameless fashion in which Abrams has recycled a film from a previous generation (and in fact, verbatim dialogue passages) and repackaged it wrapped in a glossy CGI bow for his tween audience is reminiscent of watching an American Idol contestant butcher a jazz standard. Style over substance - could it be the mantra for this generation? It certainly would be for the two teenage girls who sat in front of me while I watched this cartoon. They giggled ceaselessly at every predictable pun, sighed ardently whenever Chris Pine flexed his hair, and will wonders never cease, were reduced to tears when their generation's Captain Kirk committed the unthinkable action – a selfless act. Never mind that the scene was directly plagiarized from a far more talented and original screenwriter and Abram's directorial execution is more comparable to a shampoo commercial. We're living in the digital age where calling something a reboot gives you the artistic 'license' to steal. The box office receipts confirm it. Hollywood knows its audience. They line up like lemmings for vacuous fare like 21 Jump Street, Mission Impossible and Star Trek - Into Darkness, and this current generation of movie goers never once stops to consider why Hollywood exhibits zero fear in foisting this mediocre dreck on its hapless consumers. Movies like this confirm that, in this era of immediate digital gratification, we are experiencing the death of craft. Say goodbye to films like Goodfellas and Apocalypse Now. Bid adieu to albums like Dark Side of the Moon and Quadrophenia. The modern consumer/digital pirate has spoken with their wallets and voted in favour of a never ending stream of artistic pabulum.

"" And if you want your Trek with a social message, this movie has a pretty clear one: if we as a country forget what we stand for and become like the ""terrorists"" we fear so much, we are indeed going ""into darkness.""I'm also not sure what the comments about it not being Trekish or intellectual enough are about. This set of movies clearly references ST:TOS, a rather cheesy TV show. The typical TOS episode involved the senior officers of a ship all beaming to a desert back lot, where Kirk macked on an alien girl, Spock opined about logic and the prime directive , and everything is solved by fisticuffs. Oh, and there is a scene at least once an episode where the Enterprise is attacked and the crew defends it by vigorously throwing themselves from side to side on the set. Herman Melville it ain't.

(when people include that kind of stuff in a review it discredits the entire thing imo.)Secondly, too many people complain it has too many explosions and its too action based, in case you haven't noticed that it what 'Blockbusters' are. Funny how most of them know the definition of 'Star Trek' yet not 'Blockbuster'. If the series had started airing in the 90's or now, it would have way more explosions because they have the technology to do so and to do it more often.And finally, a lot of people say that this film is a major continuity error because of the previous films eg. Kahn or Pikes death.. 'NEWS FLASH' if you paid attention in the first film you would have realised that the new films take place in an ALTERNATE REALITY which means that ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN! These movies are not prequels and people can die and they will in any way, shape or form.Basically most of the negative reviews about this film are from 'trekkies' who cant get over their own nostalgia and those who constantly rip on 'mainstream Hollywood' movies to seem more superior and intellectual that everybody else.''more superior and intellectual that everybody else.''Funny how the quote above was basically the main theme of this movie and all that bad reviews only make the film makers/writers more right.

Nostalgia... You freaking changed the time line in movie 1 and you don't explore something new? Someone please tell Paramount I already own ""The Wrath of Khan"" and didn't need a new copy. I'm sorry but don't use patronizing the old school fans as a excuse for not creating something original. Shame on you JJ and Paramount for letting this script through without blasting it with a barrage of photon torpedoes. I loved many of the creative elements and set pieces of this reboot production, but the overly emotional trip down the Wrath of Khan slackers job of a pathetic screen play retelling was epic, only in the how bad an idea it was category. It was both insulting, lazy and damaging to a new franchise that has everything going for it! I'm just glad Paramount is going to make a fortune off of the film so they will have the opportunity to never do this crap again. The over use of lens flares in the first movie was a novelty and I think over done but cool the first time out, but do it more the second time around, really? What the use of creating all of the beautiful sets and CGI elements if its all covered up with lens flares. Did we really have to elaborate going to warp when the pop out was unique. The director, producer and writers were so bent on drawing lines backwards they have set back their hard work and originality of the first movie and let down the wonderful group of actors doing everything they can and what they must have thought when they read the script. I think Paramount and JJ owe the entire cast an apology for their efforts with this installment. I guess my question is what were the writers doing the last few years and why didn't someone, anyone stop it from happening, you guys are professionals. Then there is the subject of Carol Marcus. Well OK, You guys are a pack of geniuses to have the character of Carol Marcus performed with a British accent and her admiral father played with a American accent. I can't imagine the production being so rushed that we chose not to correct this. You folks at paramount need to reboot the obvious lack of over-site during production.I guess I need to retract a bit here because JJ & Bad Robot did something for ""Star Trek"" that had/needed to be done in the original movie, ""Reboot""! Abrams and his team of creators did this as good as anyone could have. I am still in absolute aw of efforts like ""Super 8 and Cloverfield"" but I think that after the reboot work was done it was time for him to move on. The guy just has to many irons on the fire and he is obviously not a sequel director. The Star Trek original story is important to those that grew up with the original series at a time in history when the real exploration of space was in its pioneering stage. I expected seeing something new with a new time line established. Please don't attempt to recreate the original motion pictures there is no way to improve on the Wrath of Khan it was perfect.

1157,burgermyburger,Writers should be whipped,1,27 May 2013,"Given the large vast and rich world of the Star Trek universe I am appalled at the inconsistent and bad writing of Star Trek into the darkness. I wonder if the writers actually read the whole script from front to end before submitting it.It's like scenes were written just for the visuals and then loosely written and linked together. When the viewer watches the movie it's visually stunning, it's when the viewer stops and thinks that the movie falls apart. The only thing that makes this movie bearable is the great soundtrack.As a viewer if you liked the first reboot movie and could wrap your head around the convenient bad writing of that plot you'll probably like this one. But if you're looking for a movie with more substance I recommend watching Star Trek: the wrath of khan.",Star Trek Into Darkness

I was excited to see the first of the STAR TREK (Chris Pines) reboot. The idea that you could recreate the entire Federation. I had hoped for any possibility. I toyed with ideas of Mirror Universe, or a completely different direction, I wanted ""STEAK"". What I got was regurgitated CHEESE BURGER. What happened? The Movie was great for about the first 40 minutes. Then J.J. Abrams got the phone call from Disney to do STAR WARS and he told the second in command to pull the script from ""THE WRATH OF KHAN"" and flip the dialog. Have Kirk do the Spock roll, and have Spock do the Kirk roll. The dialog was predictable and sad. I left the theater feeling robbed, and very let down. I hope that this was just a stutter step to get something out to the fans, but if they come out and save the whales in the next one (in 2016) I won't waste another 10 buck at the movies, I'll rent it for a buck at red box.

1159,wmatlach,Star Trek has left the building,7,29 May 2013,"I was happy to see the close tie-ins with previous Star Trek TV and movie productions. The spirit of most of the characters remains intact. The humor is mostly good. However, I do not recall the original Star Trek (or subsequent movies) having so much bad language. Have we really reached a point where everyone thinks that cussing adds anything to a movie? Does Hollywood believe that movies must have bad language to appeal to the public? We are not all operating in the gutter. Most people are not routinely cussing out their friends and people they meet. Personally, my wife and I and our family and friends would go to many more movies if they were a little less trashy. We want more solid content and a little less of impossible situations and people yelling cuss words. This movie sinks to a new low for family entertainment. I cannot recommend it to my family and friends and especially to anyone with children. I cannot imagine exposing your kids to this kind of language. What are people thinking? Even though I enjoyed the movie as a whole, the studio has perverted the Star Trek image to that of low life trash people. We don't need this to have a good movie. You will lose a lot of viewers and millions of dollars. Where are we going as a society? (Obviously: downhill) Does anyone care at all?",Star Trek Into Darkness

Pure fluff like cotton candy, OK for a treat but you would not want to make a meal of it. The first part of the film plays like a episode of C.S.I. on a big budget the middle is better and the last part of the film is so chaotic it is hard not to roll your eyes. The acting and the dialog made me feel that I was watching a remake of ""Spaceballs"" It feel like a parody. Overall it is fun and never really boring. In this day and age of Superhero films and big budget CGI filled films it joins the pack nicely.

However, many people watching this movie will be Trekkies, and because of this they will see the gaping plot holes, the blatant copying of previous movies and the issues with technology which Abrams cannot now get out of.The film is good for the most part, but if you are a Trekkie, then prepared to be disappointed. This film carries nothing of what made Star Trek great, there is no questioning of existence, no moral and philosophical questions that will make the film live on indefinitely. This film is good to watch, but it is far from memorable, I can only hope that this generates enough of a fan base to bring Trek back to TV, the REAL Trek that is.",Star Trek Into Darkness

Most importantly to me, a decisive victory for story narrative and the journey of the hero/heroine has been achieved. Here at last are characters that suffer and face adversary for values beyond jingoism, truism and unquestioning patriotism.""Star Trek, Into Darkness"" is nothing short of a work of wondrous fiction, thick with meaning and an unabashed examination of our current times.Please, do yourself a favour and see this spectacular film. If you are a pathetic wimp like me, you might consider not seeing it in 3D. I found the violence a bit too confrontational, as it appeared to be happening right in front of my eyes. But that's just me. No doubt most of you out there are far braver and are able to separate reality form fantasy a bit more convincingly than I can. :P Considering George Lucas dwelt in the company of Joseph Campbell of Hero with a Thousand Faces fame, the last three movies he penned himself revealed very little about either the human condition, or the journey of the hero. Ironically, J. J. Abrams, in wanting to drag Star Trek into the Star Trek mould has effectively created something far more meaningful.Considering the weight of recent political events that the movie casts us into, I feel very comfortable to join the crew again, as they journey out and go boldly where we have seldom seen recent movies go before.",Star Trek Into Darkness

If you are new to Star Trek, which they must be betting on, this movie will be an awesome and astounding experience.Of all the movies that have snubbed the fans; of all the Trek actors that have hurt the ones who love them. This film is the most heinous act of fan hatred the genre has ever known.I can see the producers now, ""This film will expose Star Trek to a whole new audience!"", and they are right. The problem is that they are ignoring the hand that feeds them.I am personally sorely disappointed the writers, producers, and director didn't have the courage to stay true to the original and creative path they blazed in the first Trek of the reboot in 2009.Shame on you Abrams!

1165,onetrunerd,A great sequel! Possibly better then the first!,9,5 June 2013,"This movie has seriously made me a born again Trekkie fan. This sequel was able to do was few sequels can do, live up to its predecessor. The story was well written, while still keeping up with the classic Kirk and Spock relationship, they actually hit the relationship at a different angle. Although addressing Spock's emotionless state and lack of understanding of friendship against rules, I truly enjoyed how Abrams continued to develop this relationship. Also, BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH. He was amazing and flawless as the main villain, Khan. Although probably not particularly correct to the original Khan, he acted incredibly well and evil. He played both the villain who you could feel for, but then turned on a dime to be utterly evil. The movie was always action packed and just when you thought it was over, it picked up again with more action. I usually am a stickler for staying true to the original material, but I actually believe that the way that Abrams was telling his story, I really liked that he switched the roles of Kirk & Spock when it came to the death scene. It was powerful to see Spock understand the power of friendship and the sacrifice and selflessness ... it was a great scene for Spock, and of course, the legendary ""KHAN"" scream scene was great. It couldn't been a louder more powerful scream, but it had its effect.There was much more fan service in this one which I'm sure original Trekkie fans are happy of! I really loved this sequel and would love to watch it again and again! Story was great, cast was awesome especially Cumberbatch and all around, a great sequel! Can't wait for the third!",Star Trek Into Darkness
1166,saddlecats,Didn't take long for this new franchise . . .,2,5 June 2013,". . . to jump the galactic shark.I really liked the Abrams reboot and was hoping for the best here. But apparently, J.J. Abrams does not have the courage of his own convictions.After creating a temporal loophole that allowed for a fresh parallel reality for the new franchise and its characters, Abrams and company have perversely turned back to the original series' timeline, not only for a recycled plot but also its key moment of grandiose tragic aspiration -- which inevitably came off as hollow and unearned.In his remake of ""The Wrath of Khan,"" Abrams is by halves both too clever and not clever enough. If you're going to bounce the new film's tropes off the old one's -- including the famous Spock death scene -- you should know that doing so automatically undercuts the existential reality of the new story. Instead of living and breathing as authentic drama, these echoes and reflections of pre-enacted scenes play like so many postmodern post-it notes on the studio white board. They're by nature counterfeit. The mind just won't accept the authenticity of the new drama, not for a New York second. This is not just because history must repeat itself as farce, but because the new film's contrivances feel so wrong in their own moment, and in the context of the specific arc leading to that moment.Consider: when Spock died in ""Wrath of Khan"" (1982), we'd known him and Kirk since 1966. That's a lot of time for us to observe (and imagine) the ups and downs of an intimate friendship. This is the advantage of television-time -- which is expansive and quotidian -- over movie-time, which is condensed and schematic. It's also an advantage gained by the long hiatus between Trek on TV and Trek in the theaters, which only burnished and deepened the bonds between its principal characters.In the parallel reality of the reboot, however, Kirk and Spock have only just -- and only provisionally -- become friends. So the drama of Kirk's apparent demise just doesn't bear tragic weight and feels glaringly artificial. Not only are you unmoved by the Death of Kirk, you're annoyed at the filmmakers for tossing it in so carelessly and expecting anyone to take to heart. (Dude, it's obvious he's going to pop back to life by picture's end.) Additionally, Spock's anguished cry of ""Khan!!!"" resonates not in the heart but in the brain, and in the wrong part of the brain, the permanently 12-year-old part that thinks it's cool that this time it's Spock who gets the line. Apart from that, there's no resonance -- just a thin po-mo echo of the original, as if that in itself signified anything whatsoever (beside the fact that the writers were trying hard for a twist). I didn't accept Scotty's resignation from the Enterprise, either -- just an awkward contrivance to get him off the ship so he could be of use further down the road. (An order is an order, even in Starfleet. And since when has Scotty been so principled, or when have his principles trumped devotion to captain? Since it was necessary to get him of the ship, that's when.) Further, Spock and Uhuru canoodling every time he's to beam off into danger? Such behavior would never occur in the quasi-militaristic milieu of the Enterprise. You can imagine the effect on discipline. Spock, as first officer, would not allow himself to be less than a paragon of proper decorum. (I've no problem with Spock and Uhuru being lovers, but we all know they would both act with more discretion. Problem is, Abrams' writers don't. They don't know some basic things about these characters or the world they inhabit.)As all these plot points -- large and small -- fell with successively louder thuds, there arrived a creeping and awful sensation that we long-time Trek devotees were inhabiting a parallel universe of cheap, shoddy construction, that Abrams was simply tipping a cynical hand to the Enterprise enterprise while attending to his real passion -- the reshuffling and regurgitation of Lucas' and Spielberg's greatest adolescent action tropes, and was doing so without too much thought or conviction. This film feels more like a mega-budget CGI parlor game than a story; as an entertainment, it barely manages to function as competent melodrama.""Into Darkness"" joins ""Prometheus"" and ""The Hobbit"" in a special hall of infamy, an inferno populated by artists we thought we admired and trusted who have turned around and betrayed/exploited their fans' loyalty with risible, self-parodying, steaming microwave cow-pie versions of their classic earlier work. The reason for this $ell-out is anyone's gue$$ (do they REALLY need the money?), but regardless, ""Into Darkness"" remains a most bitter-tasting rip-off and cynical exercise in fan exploitation. Heh. J.J. got my money this time; I wouldn't bet on the next.",Star Trek Into Darkness
1167,djkazmyrfb90,Enjoyed,9,7 June 2013,"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie but in understanding Trekkies it makes me sad that Abrams did not keep a little more of the quirks that make Star Trek Star Trek. An example is Kirk, or Picard had sayings such as 'Make it so' or 'Engage'. Maybe Abrams is waiting for it to fall into place but I'm hoping Kirk comes up with a saying soon. I understand trying to get Spock to be more human and the interaction between Spock and Uhura is getting better. But I will re-iterate the producers and the director really need to tread a careful line and make sure that enough of the original series is included in their movies because this is what drew Trekkies into the series in the first place.",Star Trek Into Darkness
1168,oracleworld,A Dog - and I am faithful to the series,1,8 June 2013,"Star Fleet is a military organization. You do not disobey orders, falsify reports, board a star ship unnoticed, argue with your superiors, or run around the ship like a Chinese fire drill. If you command a ship, and disobey the orders of a superior, why do you expect your subordinates to obey your orders? The 1950's war movies got it right, and that TV series JAG got it right. Starship Troopers got it right. A whole lot of Hollywood gets it wrong.Sorry to harp on this, but Star Trek is a sci-fi war movie series. You create exotic aliens, and advanced technology, but the rest of the show is firmly grounded in tradition. So a lot of dialog writes itself, and scenes play out naturally when you stick to tradition.The Khan character is the best alien in a long time. Played like the lead in ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"". Not quite an alien, but a person bred to be stronger, smarter, etc. So it would be expected they look like people and speak the King's English.Anyway, I get the feeling this is the end of the line for the Star Trek franchise. The movies have always been rocky and uneven, but with enough interest to see the next one. Given what this one cost to make, and what it is making at the box office ... I would pass on the next one.In a teeny-tiny genre of artistic endeavor on the internet, I am #1 worldwide, visitors from everywhere except central Africa.

1170,jbuhi13,"Illogical, Fan-boy Rehash. Abrams Please Leave us Alone...",1,10 June 2013,"Though Trek is better suited to the small screen than the big, don't classic Trek fans deserve something better than fan-boy rehash? JJ Abrams is undoubtedly better-suited to lead Star Wars. I wanted to believe I could enjoy new Trek but I can't. This is the hill I choose to die on.Whereas I came to terms with ST2009 and saw it 8 times, I regret I saw this once. In brief:The first hour was basically enjoyable except for the opening sequence. The prologue to ST2009 was stunning, but here it was just stupid. I'm glad the ""Prime Directive"" was mentioned. But, in the ""let's insult the audience's intelligence but have a pretty visual"" department (should we even compliment sci-fi movies on good visuals anymore in an era of CGI?) why was the Enterprise underwater in the first place? If you don't want the ship to be seen at all by the primitive natives, it isn't rising from the sea I'd be worried about...it'd be diving into the sea in the first place. Was there any purpose to that scene other than providing one of J.J. Abram's now signature Enterprise-in-sexy-lingerie shots? The Enterprise fly-by has always been part of big screen Trek and Abrams honors that by ascending from Saturn's rings, Niribu's water, and Earth's clouds. I concede it's a great idea, but couldn't it have been used in another way? Hiding from an enemy ship on a water planet, or something? I found this somewhere in between ""why was Nero just hanging around deep space for 25 years waiting for Kirk and Spock to grow up"" plot-hole dumb and ""how can Spock see Vulcan implode from Delta Vega?"" common sense dumb in ST:2009. Even cartoon Scotty noted it was bad for the ship. Next, ""John Harriman"" or whatever white bread name gets off to a good start. A Section 31 operative, I'm thinking. And I dig it all the way through the meeting of Starfleet minds in the Godfather III glass room. It's there that the lazy writing stunned me again. Kirk figures out it's a setup, and that's great, but how does he figure it out? Apparently it's public knowledge that if a terrorist attack happens on Earth that all of Starfleet's key personnel will meet at the 78th floor of the Mandarin Oriental Hotel at 8:30pm for surf and turf. Was this published somewhere? Seriously, add two sentences to the dialog to say something to the effect of ""how would he know the time and place of this meeting?"" and build some tension about his real identity. Sloppy.From there I am pretty much digging it until the big reveal. The Admiral was obviously going rogue, and the enthusiastic Kirk is playing right into his hands to start a bigger, more profitable, war against the Klingons (as in Star Trek VI). He equips the Enterprise with 72 strange warheads that Scotty refuses to sign for – nice touch. What are they? Are they unmanned attack drones? Or, is this more like Ender's Gamean attempt to preemptively genocide the Klingons, unknown to Kirk? Are we going to go into post-9/11 mode for some proper application of human rights commentary? A long time ago Star Trek used to be relevant and controversial like that. I'm thinking this could be somethingBut no, it's just Khan. Cumberbatch was the best actor in the flick, although he was less traditional Khan than Hannibal Lector. The sexual charisma of Ricardo Montalban (which drove Kirk to jealousy) was missing, but what he lacked in libido, he made up for in methodical ambition. And, it was nice to see Khan and Kirk united a bit. BUT, the replaying of the Star Trek II sacrifice scene, in reverse, was one of the saddest moments of my life. That sequence was the defining moment of original Trek. Spock sacrificed himself, came full circle with his humanity, and all of the ""we're friends"" dialog made sense because Kirk and Spock had a relationship we saw develop for 20 years on TV, in cartoons, and in a previous movie. In this movie we're just told they are friends, that somehow they patched up their antagonistic relationship, and that's that. Deal with it. Worst of all, the entire scene was superfluous and unnecessary, seemingly cut and paste in just for the hell of it. Furthermore, we really thought Spock was dead. People cried. No one thought Kirk was dead for a second, not with Khan's magic Chuck Norris blood out there. We had magic cancer curing blood before in the hybrid child Hera in Battlestar Galactica. Again, just as there, isn't that a huge problem: if a character has magic blood, don't you siphon it? Yea, human rights violation, but the BSG crew weren't exactly known for their adherence to the rule of law, and neither is Section 31. Even McCoy was willing to dabble in it. Isn't this blood more useful to them than a battleship?Next, I liked the idea of Spock vs. Khan. That was overdue in Trek lore. But, did it have to take place jumping around and hanging by one hand from Star Wars floating cars? It was tedious to watch. Lastly, Khan and his crew are frozen again, all in the same place at the same timeas if Khan himself weren't hard enough to deal with. I hope there is no power outage, or no more crazy Admirals. Starfleet has a death penalty. TOS established you could be executed for violating General Order 7 and visiting Talos IV. Apparently crashing a stolen ship with malice aforethought into downtown San Francisco on a workday doesn't qualify. So... shouldn't he go to Gitmo, or at least to jail? Instead, the Federation Criminal Code permits Khan to stay forever young until someone has to deal with him again. Maybe all criminals in the future receive a suspended sentence of immortality instead of jail? Terrible.",Star Trek Into Darkness
1171,guyedmondsonsa797,3 words: Benedict Goddamn Cumberbatch,10,12 June 2013,"I have always quite liked star trek.Unfortunately, I have never been a big fan of reboots I usually feel that it in no way develops the characters any further, and more often than not, this is the case.So, it was when I first watched Star Trek: Into Darkness that I realized the potential reboots can really have.The story was enthralling, the film score was bombastic and the visual effects! It was an amazing experience.But by far the real highlight of ST was Benedict Goddamn Cumberbatch. For the uninformed, Benedict Cumberbatch plays Khan Noonien Singh (is that how you spell his name?) a being who is 'better in every way.'And that isn't an exaggeration, he is better. Not just in combat, agility and mental focus, but also in: Ability to wear a trench coat and totally pull it off, Hair and voice.However i did notice a moment where khan acted rather stupidly.He (SPOILERS) was gunning down the big wigs at star fleet in a helicopter and only managed to kill like one guy before being taken down by Kirk.Really Kahn? You are a man who can easily (SPOILERS)crush the bones of 20 odd Klingon warriors without breaking a sweat. Is it just me or would he have kicked more ass WITHOUT A HELICOPTER!Anyway just a thought.

I do not know how but he created an atmosphere that I thought I was a crew member. The plot was totally unexpected. It was not a movie about a battle between good and evil. It was a movie about the hard decisions that we have to make every day and how they can influence us. Despite thinking that Cumberbatch would give more I think that all the actors had an excellent performance, especially Simon Pegg. About the visual effects and sound I think that Into Darkness is a potential candidate to win the Oscars of ""Best Visual Effects"", ""Sound Mixing"",""Sound Editing"" and maybe ""Best Makeup"". The team of J.J Abrams made a dazzling work much better than the first Star trek. If you are a lover of Sci-Fi and Thriller movies I strongly advice you to see the movie in cinema faster as you can. It is simply the best Sci-Fi movie of this year and one of the best of all time.",Star Trek Into Darkness

The story is thrilling, it is fast-paced, we have finally began enjoying the new cast, the soundtrack and sound effects are out of this world.... hey, I see no problem with a starship underwater... actually that was the first time I've seen such scene! there are also other places that no other ST movie or series has ever shown so thoroughly...and a planet with red vegetation... awesome! I really think it was a respectful movie based on Star Trek II the wrath of Khan... it is an alternative reality guys and the old Spock knows that and he has a brief appearance. When the Enterprise goes into warp, the whole theater seems to collapse! All the Enterprise crew had a very important role by saving the day all the time! J.J. Abrahms you are the guy, big time!

1182,excursion80,Great Fun Adventure,9,7 July 2013,"Some people are so critical. It was a fun movie with a good story as well. Some people are never happy or satisfied. They ask themselves why is this not more dialogue intensive and about morals like the original shows. Well, frankly, because the old shows didn't have anything else going for them so the scripts had to carry them. Today we do have great effects and action scenes, but if you cannot find the morality and struggle within these stories you are just blinded by your exaggerated disgust for newer generations of people. While the classics are still good, there are other good forms of entertainment, and this was one of them. We are seeing these characters in their youth, these movies are their character development, and their first struggles with whats right and wrong, its what the last two movies are all about. Teaching Kirk about responsibility and humility. Every Star Trek movie has had lessons of humility, sacrifice and responsibility.A lot of original trekkies loved this movie too, I watched it with several of them.",Star Trek Into Darkness

It retains the freshness, excitement and cleverness of the original, without the feeling of redundancy that plagues most sequels. The cast has grown into their (colorful) roles with ease, but this time, Quinto steals the show. Cumberbatch's role as Khan also drives the film towards aesthetic brilliance. Easily the most exciting film of the year so far, This movie is visually stunning and doesn't lack in comedy. Ignore any bad reviews!

1184,furyfrisch,Great actors and great fun,7,12 July 2013,"The newest installment of the Star Trek movies continues to aim to please. Led by director J.J. Abrams and his entourage of special effects, the film picks up where the 2009 story left off, focusing on two characters that are well known in the series world, Captain Kirk and Khan. Opening with a chase scene on a red-tinged planet and an exploding volcano, Kirk, replayed by Christ Pine, is breaking rules from the beginning and is still full of ego and womanizing ways. But as the film progresses, he shows more and more heart as he finds protecting his crew is more valuable than the primary missions he is assigned.The other primary character, Khan, is perfected by English actor Benedict Cumberbatch, who lends a menacing air coupled with deep intellect and dangerous good looks to the genetically-enhanced villain, who was played in the 1982 Star Trek movie by Ricardo Montalban. Other familiar faces return to reprise characters Bones, Scotty, Uhura, and the rest of the crew, all of them adhering well to their personality qualities and quirks. In terms of the storyline, you can expect a scattering of sadness and humor and some character interactions that will be extremely familiar to long-time watchers of the movies. There are also a few changes in the appearance of common species, such as the Klingons. Overall, the film is still fun, full of action, and good for both new Trekkies and seasoned fans to enjoy.",Star Trek Into Darkness

Other franchises of Star Trek like the series DS9 en Voyager have respect for the legacy of Gene Roddenberry. Like the first ""Star Trek"" movie Abrams made this one is worse. Using scenes from previous Star Trek films like The Wrath of Khan and The search for Spock, he makes as mess of it.I understand the idea of a new time line. But it it still a load of crap.Maybe in a next attempt Abrams will set things right and will make a proper Star Trek movie.

1186,granatj,A Good Movie That Cried Out For Major Tweaking,9,25 August 2013,"With such a Wonderful ""repeating core cast"", Great CGI effects and Large budget this movie had to be a success. However, one has to wonder if the writers ever saw the complete original series at all. As a die-hard Trekie common sense mandated that ""Kahn"" (which has been done ENOUGH in prior movies) should have been Taboo Country for this one. An older healthy Christopher Pike demeaning Captain Kirk with reference to ""son"" repeatedly did not work well at all. The addition of ""Carol"" to the crew was an inspired role for future sequels.The movie started off with a ""bang"" with fresh content that promised more of the same similar to the vintage episodes that made the original 60's version so great. New adversaries was the theme in almost every episode back then and sadly underplayed in this one. The 2009 movie provided strong character development and was ""logically"" concatenated to make it an excellent foundation for future sequels in contrast to this offering.Let's reference just a few ""The City on the Edge of Forever"", ""Bread and Circuses"", ""A Piece of the Action"" & ""The Menagerie"" and we see a common formula: excellent scripting and gripping story lines without the high price tag of computer animations. Where are the elements of ""Fun"", ""Humor"" and ""strange new aliens"" magnified in this movie? Where are the trademark beautiful alien women in this movie (Too many episodes to mention)? The original Star Trek series had many Captain Kirk brief love affairs that were void in this one.OK, in summary, this was a good flick but it should have been much better. Hopefully in the next sequel the writers will get it right. You will recall that the first movie (1979) with the original cast was a total bomb.",Star Trek Into Darkness
1187,timesdeadflowers,Bones..... what have I done?,1,4 September 2013,"***MY REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS*** I thought J J Abrams was onto something giving the franchise a reboot.... NEW UNIVERSE = NEW STORIES with the same great Trek characters we love. Sadly this film is a complete disappointment. The scriptwriters have completely ripped off Wrath of Khan and Nemesis.... why remake a Trek film from just a film ago? It has the same scenes and practically the same dialogue as those two films... can't Abrams and his writers come up with something original? Talking of the writing, haven't these guys done any research on the Trek universe...? And so many plot holes too....How come the Kirk time period appears to have better technology than the TNG universe? You have to hide a starship underwater... you couldn't just beam people down with the ship still hiding up in orbit? And the ship's engines work underwater! The meeting room at Starfleet HQ can get destroyed by a mad man in a helicopter type thing but not get shot at by another helicopter or Starfleet security? Since when have ship's communicators been intergalactic mobile phones? How come you can beam someone planet to planet but not beam up people moving around on a planet? If the Federation and the Klingons are practically at war how can Starfleet's flagship and a huge never seen before warship sit on the edge of Klingon space and not be detected/intercepted by the Klingons? How the hell does the warship get back to Earth so quickly to crash into San Francisco after it's been crippled by ""special"" photon torpedoes? I refer to it as the 'warship' because I can't remember it's proper name as I was getting it confused with the Scimitar thing from Nemesis by this point. They even ""space jumped"" ship to ship like in Nemesis, but with the aide of special suits... how come Picard & co didn't have them? Oh and Bones couldn't use one of Kahn's frozen sidekicks' blood to revive Kirk? The list could go on.... Perhaps I made the mistake of thinking too hard while watching this film... but THAT is what us Star Trek fans do! We aren't brain dead morons who will just sit and watch some shallow action movie.... Trek of the past gave us something to think about! R.I.P. Star Trek.

The created special effects are in great context of ocean bottom,surrounding volcanic and weightless environments which are sure to astound everyone. Loving the original Star trek and all later series and movies, I like to see what is happening as Paramount revitalizes the Star Trek universe to exploit with abundance the imaginative philosophical and scientific wonder-story potential Roddenberry used to build the first Star Trek universe. Paramount and Abrams simply rejuvenate the old in an alternate time line in an amazing way. The director doubtlessly chosen by Paramount for the Franchise because Abrams focus on the imaginative target of science aims perfectly at the target audience ,us. The parallel universe created in the first Abrams Star Trek film had an opportunity to boldly go to new places and confront philosophical issues as Roddenberry always did.

With that being said, this movie was terrible. The constant dumbing down of Star Trek is really getting to me. The older Star Trek movies had an element of wit and intelligence. This movie is just a bunch of blunt action with very little thought going into it.Although the story line does borrow from the original story, the story itself was weakly put together. It seemed like a bunch of action scenes are thrown together in an order that makes some logical sense. Incidentally, a plot was made along the way. All-in-all, I hope that J.J.

I am sorry I missed it in the theater, but I hat to get so emotional over a Star Trek Movie in front of those I love. Even Leonard Nimoy showed up. I remember waiting in line for the first showing of the first ""Star the Motion Picture"". I am not a Trekkie, or Trekker, but I am sure I am close to one or the other as I am so emotionally moved by these movies. Spoiler alert: I am not sure I am disturbed by the parallels between TOS and The Wrath of Kahn, but they worked for me. Here I am, sitting in my living room, watching the newest Star Trek Movie, ""cheering"" for Kirk, Spock, Scottie, Bones, everybody. It was like watching the end of Episode 4 of Star Wars, where Han Solo shows up at just the right moment over and over again. I will not apologize, I loved it, and even though I am cutting down on my purchases of DVD's and BD's, I am so glad I purchased this movie.

1194,colinebarnard,"From TOS to POS, Part Duh.... OR.... ""I AM Your Daddy, and This Isn't Trek''",3,21 September 2013,"This is a continuation of my review from account ""colinbarnard-1""Abrahms' first 2009 outing was a betrayal of anyone who is a Star Trek fan, anyone who was enthralled by the Original Series and what Gene Roddenberry was able to achieve. Roddenberry wanted to have a series that was even more a drama than the action-adventure that NBC wanted when they green-lighted the series in 1966 with Bill Shatner as Capt. Kirk. Abrahms went on The Daily Show to affirm that ''Into Darkness'' was a film for all moviegoers, and ''not '' Trek fans. Translation: the film is a shoot-em-up designed to bring in the Clearasyl and video game crowd that also serves the purpose of keeping the Trek brand of ancillary products (books, DVD's and, mirabile dictu, video games) on the store shelf. Adherence to close to 1000 episodes of continuity be damned. In reality, it would seem, Mr. Abrahms has contempt for TOS, and it shows. One can shill a lot if one has contempt for both product and audience. Oh, he and cast and crew repeatedly invoke Roddenberry, but apparently it's just lip service.As for the title ""Into Darkness""? The film would have benefited from a slower pace, more of a BSG feel to the characters, and far less gratuitous humour if it was truly supposed to be dark. The same critique that was levelled against ST: Enterprise can be levelled against 'Ìnto Darkness': the film does not advance at all the continuous universe created by Roddenberry, and nurtured with love by Rick Berman. It presents no new ideas. At least, Enterprise stayed within canon to such an extent that it even devoted an episode to explaining why TOS Klingons looked different from ST:TMP Klingons. Into Darkness, like the film that preceded it, does not even pretend to respect continuity. All it does is take a number of vignettes from the movie series, from TWOK, to, well, TWOK, and mix them up with a number of continuity alterations, acting as interludes between the action sequences and special effects segments. I suspect The Great Bird of the Galaxy would not be amused. A Federation starship called Vengeance? Khan as a pale, chinless English fop? I've been to the Punjab- nobody looks like Benedict Cumberbatch there. At least Ricardo Montalban had darker skin.The so-called alternate timeline that was established in the 2009 film, which at the time was hailed by Abrahms as being an inventive way of mixing things up without violating continuity is actually full of continuity flaws. Clearly, the writers, the same crew as Into Darkness, did not bother to screen episodes like The Immunity Syndrome, City on the Edge of Forever, or Dorothy Fontana's Yesteryear (yes, Amanda Greyson dies in that episode, too, but Spock reacts to restore the timeline, like any good Temporal Policeman would). Abrahms could have set his films in an alternate universe, a plot device he has plenty of familiarity with in Fringe. All of the changes could have been made without any concern for continuity with the Roddenberry- Berman universe. I guess someone at Paramount may have a little concern about not alienating die-hard fans. Sorry, no dice. And I am sure that I am not the only person who has been on-board since 1966 who is quite disgusted with Abrahms corporate tripe. I do not want to see Spock in love with Uhura, Scotty as a buffoon, McCoy as a buffoon and a Kirk who is an adolescent adrenaline junkie, which TOS Shatner never was, and the Enterprise, which in Roddenberry's universe was the central character of the show, being nothing more than a cross between an Apple store, and the insides of a sewage treatment plant. See the Enterprise-as- flagellum, Spock-as-flagellum sexual subtext in TMP.The reader who has not been immersed in Trek for half a century may find my insistence that ""the franchise"" adhere to a completely consistent continuity to be picayune. Kevin Smith can complain about Superman shaving; I can complain about corporate greed screwing with art.Abrahms almost certainly will not return to direct a third film. He has used his Trek experience to leverage himself into the franchise that he has wanted, and admired from the beginning: Star Wars. In fact, ""Into Darkness"" can be seen as his audition reel. It has more than a few scene duplications from Lucas' second trilogy. So, am I overly fanatical about continuity, and Abrahms' lack of respect for it, and Trek as a whole? No. If the director Kevin Smith, who is a comic book fanatic, can devote a substantial amount of thought to how Superman is able to shave, then I can lament the betrayal of Trek by Abrahms, Orci, Kurtzman and Lindendorff. I know I am not alone, and this is hurting Paramount where they they only care- their ledger sheet. Thank god (which neither Roddenberry nor I believe in) I didn't pay to see this film. I will not give Paramount my money. The rest of you can go to this shoot-em-up leave your brain at the door. In 20 years, it will still be Shatner and Nimoy who are associated with these characters, because they helped create those characters. Hopefully, if someone is making Trek in 2033, they will have read The Making of Star Trek, by a writer, humanist and self-described philosopher, junior grade, named Gene Roddenberry. Abrahms, I am afraid, will be remembered with Michael Bay as a Spielberg wannabe who was just a Hollywood player, cynically shovelling product for the masses.

I have been in awe of the first one and I'm now in love with the second. The emotional content doesn't in any way take away from the original concept, it actually makes it ten times better! After all those years, all those TV shows and movies, I didn't believe there was anything more to say in this story; but the creators of this new series proved me wrong. All the characters are more or less fateful to the original but with an added depth and quirkiness that just simply makes it compelling to watch over and over without getting tired of it.

He continued to argue that the movie was good until the end, in which case it was a cop out of something that had already been done before (those who have seen other Star Trek motion pictures know what I'm talking about. Being sensitive to spoilers) This was my argument:Yes it does mirror some previously established Star Trek plots, but the twists that accompanied the mirages are COMPLETELY important to what makes this film unique. The changes that were made to story lines from the original series completely change the way that the characters react and open them up to future discoveries that could not have been made in the original series (I'm mostly referring to Spock's emotional availability)Even in the tiniest details it connects to the original series, down to the Tribbles, making any Trekkie feel right at home for the majority of the movie. The film was filled with the sass, wit, and banter that the characters in this show are known for and keep the audience on their toes with the surprises built in.Maybe one or two other times in my life have I wanted to stand up in the theater or my living room (or wherever I was watching whatever I was watching) and root for a character so badly. The line from the trailer sums it all up. ""Is there anything you would not do for your family?"" This movie shows exactly how much of a family they truly are and I could not have been happier with this film.By the way I NEVER see a movie multiple times in theaters due to the obscene prices, but I was willing to go three times to see this film, if that tells you anything.",Star Trek Into Darkness

To be frank, quite a few of the movies were pretty clunky, as was a great deal of TNG, and Voyager is, well... a bit dull, mostly.The first 'rebooted' movie I thoroughly enjoyed, with the spectacular SFX combined with a great cast, an excellent and intelligent script, perfectly timed bursts of comedy and a good few cheesy homages to the original.So I sat down to this sequel with a great appetite. Unfortunately what I got was mostly a great deal of flash and bang, with what seemed clumsier and far less elegant SFX, a great deal of shouting, and not much else. I too ended up with a headache, as well as being completely flummoxed by the total lack of sense in the story exacerbated by vast holes in the script, not to mention the truly awful wholesale recreation of vignettes from previous movies, stitched together like a cheap bootleg, rather than any kind of homage. And to top it all, most of the great characters, who are all still present, are given nothing to do while Kirk shouts like an angry baby and Spock looks utterly confused. Cumberpatch is good, but frankly Khan he ain't. And what that character was doing there in the first place is a complete mystery... even given the 'changed time-line' plot excuse, the Botany Bay would still have sailed a long time ago. Awful.

I enjoyed JJ Abrams' first Star Trek film, despite it essentially being one long action scene and no character development. While I'm not really a fan of the series, I was forced to watch it over and over again by my dad when I was a kid, so I managed to catch all of the references the first time I saw Into Darkness.And therein lies my issue with this film. For a while, it's great - like the first film, it's got great action sequences, and it even has some touching scenes between Kirk and Pike, which was nice to see. But as soon as the 'homages' to Wrath of Khan and the original series started, it became a bit of a joke. I just feel like they shoehorned a bunch of references in to please fanboys, even though they made no sense. Hey, how about a pointless cameo from Leonard Nimoy? How about a furry testicle that pops up in one scene for no reason? How about Spock shouting 'Khaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaan' in the worst way possible? Seriously, it reminded me of Vader's 'Noooooooooooooo' at the end of Episode III, it was that bad.Maybe I'm being too harsh. I think they made a few mistakes, but as I said it's still a good film.

Captain Kirk (Chris Pine, Unstoppable), Spock (Zachary Quinto, Heroes), and Doctor McCoy (Keith Urban, Lord of the Rings: Return of the King) are determined to bring him to justice. Even if it means entering enemy space to the evil Klingon homework, Kronos. J.J. Abrams returns to his revival of the science fiction epic: Star Trek, originally created by Gene Roddenberry, to deliver us this fast-paced, space-exploring film. It is a film with acting worthy enough for fans, but I am disappointed with its plot and the use of the characters in it. The terrorist, John Harrison, seeks revenge on Starfleet and plots the destruction of the archives in London. Seeking Harrison, Kirk and the Enterprise crew seek him on the planet, Kronos. After a battle where Harrison nearly single handedly defeats a host of battle-hardened Klingons, he surrenders to save his crew who are, unknowingly to Kirk, on the broken down Enterprise. There he is questioned by Kirk and is revealed to be the legendary Khan, a genetically engineered war criminal bred to be superior in everything. One of my biggest problems with this movie is that the role of the villain isn't solely on Khan, but is partially also on Admiral Marcus (Peter Weller, Robocop), who backstabs the Enterprise to silence Khan. My problem is that Khan is THE villain; the greatest adversary the Enterprise of the original series has ever faced, later emphasized by Spock Prime (Leonard Nemoy). The character Khan is fueled by the need for revenge. In Star Trek II: Wrath of Khan, he has the urge to find and kill Captain Kirk, portrayed by William Shatner. Now, in Into Darkness he is filled with rage to kill Admiral Marcus. My expectation of the film was that it would be similar to Wrath of Khan, however it fell short. My hope for the future of this franchise is that Khan will return in some way to seek Kirk. Also, I am disappointed with Spock's use of emotion. Emotionlessness is a staple of the character Spock and to break it is cruel. One of the best castings of the film is Zachary Quinto as Spock, butthe plot just destroyed the character. For example, having a romantic relationship with Uhuru. Spock is supposed to find emotion confusing and useless, not show it actively. Some people might argue that Spock is emotional because of the death of his mother and home planet, Vulcan. This is a plausible explanation, but Vulcan's are known for their control of emotion or something very bad could happen. J.J. Abrams continues to show his skills as a director. The special effects are superior to any movie of the year. For acting, Benedict Cumberbatch makes his first appearance to the American public after a successful run with BBC on the show Sherlock as Sherlock Holmes. In Into Darkness, Cumberbatch is outstanding as Khan. Keith Urban showed great skill playing McCoy with using great metaphors, a characteristic of McCoy. The role of Captain Kirk was reprised by Chris Pine, whose performance was adequate. Overall, J.J. Abrams uses the alternate reality to successfully revive Star Trek. Into Darkness is a great movie for the fans but compared to the original films, there are major flaws in the film. I recommend seeing this movie to anyone, so they can enjoy it and also critique it like I have. Hopefully, Khan will return.",Star Trek Into Darkness
1204,shane-appel,"Well acted, well cast, doesn't quite live up to potential",7,24 February 2014,"Star Trek: Into Darkness is a well cast, well-acted, well directed film, which still manages to disappoint at nearly every turn. Christopher Pine, Zachary Quinto, and (especially) Karl Urban, as Kirk, Spock, and Bones respectively, do no disservice to their namesakes. Pine's Kirk is confident, macho, intelligent, and brash, often to a fault. Quinto portrays everyone's favorite Vulcan Spock quite well, he is calm and collected, and there is weight, and implied wisdom behind his words. Karl Urban plays Dr. Leonard McCoy so convincingly, with such curmudgeon , even when he quips "" Damn it Jim I'm a doctor not a ______"" it feels real, not like some shoe horned catch-phrase. The film is very well paced, the beats are exciting and interesting, and the film never feels boring despite its considerable length. The action is expertly choreographed, from Star Ships blasting each other from orbit, to Kirk speeding down the corridors of the Enterprise. This is all enhanced by the magnificent special effects. High quality effects are really just par for the course now for any decently budgeted Hollywood film, but even conceding that, it still looks fantastic. The score is adequate, but compared with previous Star Trek film scores, it really pales in comparison. In the past Star Trek has employed world class composers such as Leonard Rosenman and Jerry Goldsmith, a sharp contrast to Into Darkness composer Michael Giacchino whose credits include "" Cars"" and "" Ratatouille"". Star Trek has always been overwhelmingly story driven. It is, at its best, cerebral, thought provoking science fiction. This is not the case for Star Trek : into Darkness. The plot is predictable, to an almost comical extent. Few films in the last decade can claim to be as strictly formulaic. All the standard action movie tropes are there, they really pulled out all the cliché's this time around, no pulled punches. The result of all this is, the final product feels much closer to a throw away summer blockbuster, more akin to Transformers or the latest Die hard than anything recognizable as Star Trek.",Star Trek Into Darkness
1205,jane-rich61,"late in the ratings, but what a terrific film!",10,1 March 2014,"I just had the pleasure of finally watching Star Trek Into Darkness, and this is my first review. I was raised watching the original ST series, and watch reruns to this day. Never ""got into"" any of the other incarnations of the series, as to me they never were quite the same - missed the nuances and interactions of the original crew of the Enterprise.This movie, and the previous Star Trek movie in 2009, have absolutely blown me away! As a ""purist"" fan, I enjoyed every minute of this movie, and can't wait to watch it again. The actors have fully embraced their characters. I laughed at each reference to the original series, and found the new dimensions to their stories believable. Kirk, Spock, Uhura, Bones McCoy, Scotty, Chekov, and Sulu are all real again, not re-presentations, but true to their original core. The changes in reality are believable, and easy to follow. It does open a whole new way to consider and possibly build from the original shows, which never had the benefit of big budgets and special effects. One special element that hasn't changed and shines in this movie is that,even with technology, nothing beats hand to hand combat and the human spirit! Same as it ever was, but so much more polished and amazing to see what our current techno-cinematography can add. Not once in this movie did the special effects take away from the spirit of the film - just made it more spectacular. Can't wait for the next one!",Star Trek Into Darkness
1206,RubiPaulin,Awesome,10,26 March 2014,"i love this movie, Chris Pine did some awesome acting along with every other actor in this film. it kept me entertained all the time that its like I was in another world when I finished watching it. if you are into fantasy and space stuff then this is a good movie to watch. I could watch it a lot of times and not get tired of it. since this movie has drama action a little romance and comedy it makes it a good even family film. I have different taste from other people when it comes to movies and its really hard for a movie to impress me but this one did its job right. The cool designs plus the great acting is what put this film together and made it into a good one. to some it might not be the best but once you watch it you cant deny it was worth watching. Really recommend it. you wont regret it.",Star Trek Into Darkness
1207,cdettlinger,Dumbed down from a highly intelligent and thoughtful franchise.,1,17 May 2013,"Star Trek Into Darkness should be renamed Star Trek In Name Only. What has always distinguished Star Trek from other sci-fi is the thoughtful and nuanced way that philosophical and sociological commentary was woven into the stories. Star Trek is not just a lot of sci-fi nonsense but a meaningful exploration of what it means to be human. In the past, Star Trek has been intelligent and character driven. Now it is all fancy CGI and snappy one-liners. Abram's Star Trek is an action-for-action's sake Kirk and Spock buddy flick. The ""surprises"" Abrams plants aren't surprises if you're familiar with the Star Trek universe. His preference for violence and political intrigue makes Abrams' vision more Star Wars than Star Trek.The fill-in-the-blanks plot is a repetitive onslaught of video-game like CGI sequences separated by brief breaks used to set up the next CGI spectacle. The first half begins with a scene taken from Raiders of the Lost Ark and quickly moves to The Return of the King's Mount Doom. Cumberbatch's attack on Starfleet HQ is a scene stolen from Godfather 3. When Cumberbatch is captured, he and Pine briefly become caricatures of Hannibal Lecter and Agent Starling from Silence of the Lambs. The second half attempts to remake The Wrath of Khan but is backwards and upside down. Instead it is practically a beat-for-beat repeat of the identically plotted Star Trek Nemesis.The cast was the best thing about the last movie but not this time. The other familiar crew members each get a brief moment in the spotlight but for the most part they fixate on comedic asides. The romance between Uhura and Spock is unnecessary and actually diminishes Uhura's character. Alice Eve is little more than eye candy. Peter Weller's Admiral Marcus is a disappointment. Karl Urban was eerily good as McCoy last time but stays in the background this time, a third wheel on the Kirk/Spock bicycle. Pine's beefy frat-boy Kirk is an exaggeration of Shatner's Kirk. When he is angry he sounds like a bratty child. Cuberbatch's performance is the best thing this time and overshadows everyone else.I left the theater thinking that my free passes were over-priced.",Star Trek Into Darkness
1208,matthew-falkenstein,"Ugh, so close!",1,8 June 2014,"OK, the first jj reboot movie was pretty good. This second was terrible. You see, i don't care about the film style or its increased rate of action. What I do care about is the copy paste scenes from other movies and the lack of original thinking. The iconic Spock and Kirk scene,from wrath of Kahn, going spaceship to space ship just like data did on nemesis etc. and the Kahn blood being the magic elixir was just a band-aid slapped onto a crappy script, so it could resolve. I love star trek, but this movie lacked ambition. Now If you're a trekkie and haven't seen other films or watched the kahn storyline in TOS, then by all means, i don't judge you if you liked this movie. If you would call yourself a trekkie and enjoy and know what i'm talking about, then promptly give yourself a joan of arc death.

I have not seen other films trek old star, but the last two movies I've seen are so good that I have become an avid follower of this saga. Abrams congratulate the director, because he has done a great science fiction movie that keeps you entertained from beginning to end. this movie has a great plot, great script, good effects to watch them in high definition, good passages of humor, great end and leave open the possibility of more movies, the truth is that it is one of the best science fiction movies.",Star Trek Into Darkness

Morality has a strong place in the film, characters are as lively as in the original series, hope to see a series developed based on what has been achieved with this film. The special effects were great and they added to the story and helped advance the plot. The movie seemed to try to hold true to the characters of the original series. I unsure if the cameo by Lenord Nimoy added anything to the story The story. The movie tried to work in many different aspects of past movies and series, and I feel this was done quit well.

1211,ptrecie,Love this movie!,10,27 December 2014,"Star Trek: Into Darkness is one of my favorite Sci-Fi films. I love Star Trek(2009) as well. I will say that Wrath of Khan, the original film of which this one was based on was better. In fact, Wrath of Khan is the best Star Trek movie, in my opinion.I love this film because i love Sci-Fi and action and Star Trek usually has a lot of action in it which i like. But i do have some problems with this film 1. Khan;Khan is supposed to be middle eastern and Benedict Cumberbatch, who plays Khan in this movie is obviously British, not Middle-eastern. 2. Why does the gun Kirk throws not go towards where he wants it to go, but it hits it's destination anyway?",Star Trek Into Darkness

A lot darker but plenty of action.The role reversal of Kirk dying from radiation sickness not Spock (as in the original Wrath of Khan)was a nice touch.Only confusing part was that Khan was originally of Indian origin.Plenty of amusing moments.Good fight sequence between Spock and Khan.Bones is as acerbic as ever, nice tribute to the original.Scotty his usual ""Miracle Worker Self""Rest of cast produce solid performances, hope they get better character development than in the TV series.",Star Trek Into Darkness
1213,chalkes,Watched it again still the same feeling,1,27 September 2015,"yes I am old school trekkie .. The opportunity to reboot sounded great. I just watched this movie again to give it one more go. What a waste of time.The result - just another far fetched, over the top, CGI action flick. The ship is there and the crew but really, the whole thing is absurd.The thought of Spock totally losing his cool (almost through the whole movie) means there is little connection to the original character. What drove Nimoy to make his cameo when he would have read the script and understood there was little to gain except a pay cheque of course. Bringing Khan back again had little value other than luring old trekkies into a false sense of reliving the great on screen presence that Montalbin, the original, had.I suppose I will just go back and watch the original movies.",Star Trek Into Darkness
1214,davisr-09996,Star crap Into Darkness,4,23 December 2015,"This is my first review ever. I just watched STID last night for the first time. Let me say I am a long term Trekkie and loved the series and earlier movies.I will add that I almost never like a remake over or as much as the original. When I saw the the first JJ Abrams movie in 2009 I was appalled. I don't know maybe I am getting old but I was offended by the new storyline. I could forgive that change in the first movie but I can no longer be silent. The idea that Spock is having an on-going relationship with Uhura is absurd. It should never have even been considered by the writers. When Spock yells KHAN!!! I was literally yelling at the screen. Totally ridiculous. So many things like that in this movie made me cringe. Kirk and Spock have no real relationship here. I guess we are just supposed to assume it is there due to our knowledge of the series but there is no evidence of it here. That makes the death scene actually painful to watch. I also believe that much of the old show and movies magic was the other interactions of Kirk and Scotty, Kirk and Bones, Bones and Spock but that really doesn't happen in these movies. Why on earth did they take Scotty out as Chief Engineer other than to free him up to power down the dreadnaught later. The kid playing Chekov OMG...I could go on but you get the picture. I gave the movie a 4 only due to special effects.",Star Trek Into Darkness
1215,simon-54463,Star Trek By Numbers,2,5 March 2016,"Star Trek Into Darkness feels sadly like a film that was created shortly after someone read a book on how to write screenplays and then another on how to direct action movies. Just about everything in this film is prefaced with the obligatory set-up scene then punctuated with an equally obligatory action sequence and carried off with a frustrating lack of passion, commitment and subtlety that left me groaning in despair. Performance and direction are in full automatic mode for the entire two hours.For some inexplicable reason Star Trek Into Darkness eschews the tradition of raising the moral and ethical issues that are the life blood of the franchise, preferring instead to settle for a series of mindless stunts and action sequences that are simultaneously unoriginal, unconvincing and unengaging.There are ancient clichés here that reminded me of TV cop movies from the Seventies. I won't go into them but, trust me, you'll recognise them when you see them.In truth I couldn't have cared less whether Kirk, Spock and the rest of the crew lived, died or warped into hyperspace only to disappear up their own black holes.This is Star Trek by numbers. It's tiresome, repetitive and, in my view, an insult to the franchise. This is two hours I would much prefer to have spent playing Sudoku. And boy do I hate Sudoku.",Star Trek Into Darkness

His name is Khan Noonien Singh! The role of Khan is of a fecking IndianKhan's warlike, aggressive and ruthless Thugee ancestry is/was a crucial factor in his makeup, which was well explored during ""Space Seed"" (TOS) which led in continuity to ""The Wrath of Khan"", ""The Search for Spock"" and ""The Journey Home"" Star Trek movies.""Bones"" brags he played midwife during the birth of a sextuplet of reptilian Gorn, while in chronological terms, the Gorn actually first emerged as an alien species in Season 1 Episode 18 ""Arena"" (TOS) Up until then, the Gorn were a totally unknown race, from an uncharted sector of non-federation space.Perhaps it was in this as-yet uncharted region that Mcoy came across the Tribble he was experimenting on during this movie, even though the Tribbles were also an unknown species until Season 2 Episode 15 ""The Trouble With Tribbles"" (TOS)There is even more than a heavy hint that Kirk played sticky-Dickie with nurse Chapel, which flies in the face of Mijael Roddenberry's well played and unrequited adoration of Spock, NOT KIRK in her role as nurse Chapel during the entire original TV series!And finally Reversing Spock's Role with Kirkk to rehash the now famous ""The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few"" speech given by Spock in ""The Wrath of Khan"" movie was just plain annoying.This ""new scene"" has Kirk die in a sealed Radioactive chamber in the engine room instead of Spock They even touched fingers through the glass door!If I ever meet the so-called ""script writers"" Robert Orci, Alex Kurtzman and Damon Lindelof, together, I will place my fingers on their limo window and paraphrase, ""I have never been, and never will be, your friend"" ...lolSo, although I would STILL haul my testicles over a mile of broken glass for just 5 minutes in Uhura's pantie drawer, as an ardent Trekkie I give Star Trek Into Darkness a big fat ZERO.",Star Trek Into Darkness

But it's not true to Star Trek - take that as you will. Despite this I think that would be pretty much fine and forgiven for the most part *if* they weren't also rebooting the original and recasting characters. If it was just a telling of some kind of Starfleet crew where they could actually use the creativity, writing and budget to craft truly unique characters, relationships and situations I would be far more open to it. I felt that all of the actors were cast well as their respective characters, so I don't know why they couldn't have just used this to generate a new set of circumstances involving a Starfleet crew, which could have existed as an action movie while not offending the original vision of Star Trek as a true science fiction.I'm hoping for something very much different for the new TV show but I would be lying if I said this didn't have me worried.

It's much darker than the first one and deals with complex themes and high emotional stakes. While the first one served as a great introduction to the series, 'Into Darkness' delves into the character setups, relationships and world building. It's extremely satisfying to witness Chris Pine's Jim Kirk evolve from the immature and brash character in the first film to the heroic, selfless captain we all know and love. Spock's character arc in the film is also handled nicely and Benedict Cumberbatch is fantastic as the villain. With a cast as large as this, it's difficult for everyone to get the same amount of screen time. However, I felt that each character had their moment to shine and in the end, it felt that the characters were served well. It is a suspenseful and thrilling watch with a captivating plot and stunning visuals. There were a few underdeveloped points that could have been further fleshed out and more moments from the crew would have been welcomed but overall, I find this film difficult to truly fault.

Though there are some minor plot holes and it has a slightly more convoluted plot, nothing can slow down this spectacular juggernaut of a film. Also, Benedict Cumberbatch steals every (dramatic pause) single (dramatic pause) scene (dramatic pause).That said, I must also review this film as a fan of Star Trek... This is a beautifully crafted love letter to Star Trek fans, with nods to specific scenes, episodes and even previous films-- from the original series to Star Trek First Contact. This movie takes everything we know and love about Star Trek and pumps it full of adrenaline. Everybody in the ensemble got their time to shine... more than any other Trek movie! Scenes paid homage and re-contextualized lines and shots from past Trek outings. And I thank the writers for that. I went into this movie with high expectations, and I left the theater feeling very happy that I knew all those references and that I appreciated it on a deeper level than most people at the cinema.",Star Trek Into Darkness

Easy to criticise if you are precious about the franchise past and easy to dismiss by the more aloof critic. Sit back, buckle up and feel the g-force as lift off takes the story to orbit. Better paced than the reboot, more joined up as it moves from one arc to another in the storyline. Perhaps at the end, a little bit dragged out when the ending could have come a few minutes earlier but perhaps this is setting up for the next thrill ride.
