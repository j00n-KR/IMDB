0,MartinHafer,A side of war we just don't see often enough in films.,9,24 September 2021,"Most war films, particularly those made decades ago, glorify war and seldom, if ever, talk about the true cost. Think about it....it's hard to imagine John Wayne or Jimmy Stewart breaking down and sobbing after a battle! But there is a reality to war, the psychological trauma, that just isn't talked about enough...especially since it doesn't just hurt the soldier but their families as well.In ""Brothers"", the film begins with a real black/white situation. There are two brothers...a good, honorable one and the other a jerk who's just gotten out of jail. But life is rarely black and white...and over time, the 'bad brother' (Jake Gyllenhaal) manages to do something with his life while the 'good one' (Toby McGuire) goes off to war and it emotionally damaged to such a point that he's a danger to his family.This is a tough film to watch. If you've been through war or had family members affected by PTSD, this film might even be tougher to watch...to the point where you might want to watch this with someone and have some Kleenex handy. But I think this is a good thing. The film is wonderfully crafted and acted...but brings attention to our veterans and their plights.....plights which are certainly understandable considering what they've been through. A very good film...well worth seeing.By the way, this is a remake of a Danish film...which I have not seen but plan to see.",Brothers
1,SnoopyStyle,some great acting,8,14 November 2016,"Marine Capt. Sam Cahill (Tobey Maguire) is going to Afganistan on another tour leaving behind his wife Grace (Natalie Portman) and their two young daughters. He picks up his brother Tommy (Jake Gyllenhaal) getting out of prison after serving his time for armed robbery. The family gathers for a dinner before Sam leaves. Tommy fights with their military father Hank (Sam Shepard). The family is stunned when Sam is reported killed in a helicopter crash. In reality, he's been captured by the Taliban along with Private Joe Willis. At home, Tommy cleans up his act while getting closer to Grace. Captivity turns horrific and when Sam is rescued, he returns home psychologically damaged.This cast is stacked and they all bring it. Director Jim Sheridan is able to nurture some amazing work especially from Tobey Maguire. Portman, Gyllenhaal, Shepard, and even little Bailee Madison show their acting muscles. The story does feel a little melodramatic like a broad Greek tragedy. That's par for the course. This is big time acting.",Brothers
2,Hitchcoc,Heart Wrenching,8,14 April 2010,"I have the great fortune to have never had to be in the situation these men find themselves. I think the movie's strength is in showing us what war can be and what a tortured soul can be. Some have said what they would do in this circumstance. Perhaps some would have been dead heroes. This guy wasn't. He ultimately succumbed and paid a tremendous price. The movie wasn't meant to be a John Wayne thriller where a man walks through a hundred machine guns trained on him. It is about someone locked in a hole for months and it's about what could happen to (has happened to) people like him. I do agree that the military would have intervened with psychological counseling and debriefing before sending the young man home again. Nevertheless, if you believe that this kind of resolution is possible then the acting and directing are really very good.",Brothers
3,claudio_carvalho,"A Teen Remake of ""Brødre""",6,23 July 2010,"The family man Marine Captain Sam Cahil (Tobey Maguire) is happily married with his beloved Grace (Natalie Portman) and adores his two daughters Isabelle (Bailee Madison) and Maggie (Taylor Geare). His younger brother Tommy (Jake Gyllenhaal) has just left prison on probation for bank robbery and has issues with his father Hank (Sam Shepard). Grace does not like him either but Sam invites Tommy to have dinner at home with their family. When Sam is sent back to Afghanistan, his helicopter crashes and he is considered missing in action and presumed dead. However, he is captured with friend Private Joe Willis (Patrick Flueger) and they are submitted to all sort of tortures, culminating with Sam killing Joe with a bar. Meanwhile Tommy comforts Grace and the children and he becomes close to Sam's family. When Sam is rescued by the American soldiers, he comes back home completely paranoid, psychotic, introspective and without feeling or affection for his family. Further, he is convinced that Grace and Tommy have had sex during his absence. When Isabelle lies during a family dinner about the relationship of Grace and Tommy to upset her father, the disturbed Sam triggers an intense paranoia jeopardizing his family, Tommy and himself. ""Brothers"" is a powerful drama about family dynamics destroyed by war. I discover that this good movie is based on Susanne Bier's ""Brødre"" that I have not seen yet. Jim Sheridan shows again his ability to work with children, the same way he did in ""In America"" and the girls Bailee Madison and Taylor Geare have awesome performances. Tobey Maguire, Natalie Portman, Jake Gyllenhaal and Sam Shepard have top-notch performances, giving credibility to the story. Now I expect to see the original Danish movie to compare with the American version. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Entre Irmãos"" (""Between Brothers"")Revised review after watching ""Brødre"":""Brothers"" is actually a teen remake of ""Brødre"". Tobey Maguire is completely miscast in the role of a marine captain despite his great performance. In the original movie, Ulrich Thomsen is a mature man with face of man in the role of a major, and not a ""babyface"" in the role of a captain. Jim Sheridan filmed practically frame by frame the film of Susanne Bier, but replacing adult and realistic situations with shallow trivializations to adequate the story to the American society. In his version, just as an example, Grace and Tommy smoke marijuana when they kiss each other instead of the emotional situation of the original story. Or the motive why Sam is forced by his captors to kill Joe Willis in the Afghan camp. The open conclusion in the original movie is another plus. The impact of ""Brothers"" is totally different for those that have not seen ""Brødre"" My vote is six.",Brothers
4,kosmasp,Based on ...,8,20 January 2011,"This is based on an European film (danish I think), which unfortunately I had not seen before I watched the US Remake at hand. I did watch this at a sneak preview, so I had no idea what would be coming on. And although I had no idea and did not know the original, it was very obvious (early on) were this was going.So it is predictable (to most people I would think), but I still rated it pretty high. Now that has to do with the acting on hand. While I am not so sure about Tobey, I do think that the rest of the cast really deliver on the premise and the drama of the story. Tobey does too, but only up to a point (though you could argue he has not that much to work off). I liked it, but I do want to see what the other movie has done with the similar theme.",Brothers
5,lee_eisenberg,commendable siblings,7,8 July 2010,"Jim Sheridan's ""Brothers"" casts Tobey Maguire and Jake Gyllenhaal as siblings Sam and Tommy, who have ended up the opposite of each other. Sam is a captain in the marines, about to get shipped to Afghanistan. Tommy is the black sheep. But when Sam's helicopter crashes and he is presumed dead, Tommy moves in with Sam's wife Grace (Natalie Portman), forcing both to take a new look at their lives.I've never seen the Danish film on which this was based, but I do think that this one was worth seeing. It's sort of a ""Coming Home"" for the 21st century, although not in the same league as ""Coming Home"" or ""Apocalypse Now"". The particularly chilling scenes take place in the second half of the movie. Seriously, some of them made me feel as though I had just stopped breathing.So, while this isn't a masterpiece, I still think that it's a movie that everyone should see. Mind you, there are some really unpleasant scenes.Also starring Sam Shepard, Mare Winningham, Carey Mulligan and Clifton Collins Jr.",Brothers
6,jboothmillard,Brothers,5,14 May 2011,"From director Jim Sheridan (My Left Foot, In the Name of the Father), I might have heard about this from Film 2009 with Jonathan Ross, and with three good leading stars I was certainly interested. Basically Marine Captain Sam Cahill (Golden Globe nominated Tobey Maguire), leader, athlete and good father and husband, is going to be heading back to Afganistan, but not before welcoming home his brother. Tommy Cahill (Jake Gyllenhaal) is the screw-up who has done time in prison for armed robbery, and he is coming home to live and in a way help look after his brother's wife Grace (Natalie Portman) and the children, young daughters Isabelle (Bailee Madison) and Maggie (Taylor Geare). In Afganistan we see Sam in a helicopter with his men, and it suddenly shot down by enemy fire and crashing into the below water, and it assumed he is dead and Grace is informed of this news. While Sam is in fact still alive, along with hometown friend Private Joe Willis (Patrick John Flueger), Grace suffering terribly from the ""loss"" is slowly lifting her hatred for her brother-in-law, and months pass with mourning turning into a one-time passionate kiss. Though Tommy wins affection from the two daughters, any attraction he and Grace have for each other does not go any further, they regret the kiss. Meanwhile Sam and Joe are being mentally tortured by the country terrorists, forced into making video tapes dismissals, and when Joe breaks and is deemed useless Sam is forced at gunpoint to kill his friend with a lead pipe. Not long after a group of US military soldiers attack the enemy and rescue a traumatised Sam, Grace and Tommy are both naturally shocked to learn that he is alive, and of course it will take a long time for normality to return. What is apparent though is that with the months they have spent together the kids have bonded more towards to Tommy, and with his mentality damaged Sam not only does a lot to turn them against him, but his paranoia has gone into overload. Grace and his brother do confess that they did kiss each other, but Sam snaps believing that they also slept together, destroying the kitchen and getting a gun out. In the end Sam is admitted to a mental hospital, confessing to killing Joe Willis, and she reads a letter that he wrote before leaving for Afganistan wondering if normal life can restore. Also starring Sam Shepard as Hank Cahill, Clifton Collins Jr. as Major Cavazos, Carey Mulligan as Cassie Willis, Mare Winningham as Elsie Cahill, Jenny Wade as Tina and Ethan Suplee as Sweeney. The best performance of the film is obviously Maguire with his fantastic burst-out temper fuelled moments, Portman is alright as the grief stricken and mostly down in the dumps wife, and Gyllenhaal I felt wasn't on screen as much as he could have been but was okay. From the clips I saw I expected this to be a film where the brother does sleep with the other brother's spouse, but it works a lot better as a high paranoia thing, a good effort wartime melodrama. It was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Original Song for U2's ""Winter"". Worth watching!",Brothers
7,Quinoa1984,a triumph of acting over story,8,10 December 2009,"Brothers is something we may have seen before - if not in its original incarnation from Denmark in 2004 then The Deer Hunter - then it is something that surprises just on the vulnerability, subtlety and ferocity of the actors in their roles. It's not about what the trailer pushes, which is an affair between a guy (Jake Gyllenhaal) and his sister in law (Natalie Portman) while the one guy's brother (Tobey Maguire) is away at war. There is one scene of that, but that's not really what the film is 'about' per-say. It's about the personal affects of war on one man, a horrific tragedy that befalls him, and how he has to live with that the rest of his life, specifically in front of his wife and children. Maguire's Sam says it simply towards the end: ""Only the dead see the end of war. I have seen the end of War. How do I go on living?"" If I may have spoiled the message of the movie- and in its own microcosm way it's as anti-war (or perhaps just anti-torture) as it could get in modern movies- it shouldn't detract from the pleasures of Brothers. This is seeing the actors- Portman, Gyllenhaal, Sam Shephard, especially Maguire- fill in these characters with enough depth and passions and fears and desires and ghosts that make them more than real to us. That's not just their achievement but director Jim Sheridan's. He lets his players breathe life into characters who, while not wooden or two-dimensional by any stretch, need that extra push as seen in David Benioff's characterizations and scenarios. Family life, its fragility and it's equal amount of love and self-torment, is what counts (again, Deer Hunter), and it's this that works in the film.A word though about Tobey Maguire. I'm not the only critic pointing him out, and it goes without saying he's not the only worthwhile actor in the cast (there's even performances by the girls playing Sam's kids that are extraordinary). But it's the transformation that really counts. Perhaps it's noteworthy that both brothers do transform in the film, as Tommy, the ex-con, goes from being a drunken nobody to stepping up to help his brother's barely-holding-it-together wife after the news that her husband is dead, while Sam is in the downward spiral. It's crucial too that Sheridan shows those scenes in Afghanistan that cause Sam to change so radically as he does (the way they're inter-cut in the at-home narrative is a little uneasy, one of the flaws of the film), so that we see a good person shrunk down to his deepest, darkest depths.When that last third comes around, it's electrifying how intense Maguire can get, even when he's just in his insinuating mode ala Jake LaMotta of accusing his brother of adultery. For anyone just looking at Maguire as Spider-Man's Peter Parker must give this a look to see his range; indeed a double feature of Brothers and Seabiscuit will show how Maguire is one of the most underrated actors under forty in Hollywood. If the role calls for it, as it does here, he goes to town, a you-can't-blame-him Oscar bait performance.",Brothers
8,michaelRokeefe,Brothers will always be brothers.,7,14 April 2010,"Intense drama from director Jim Sheridan. Marine Captain Sam Cahill(Tobey Maguire)gets his orders to ship out for another tour of duty in Afghanistan. His brother Tommy(Jake Gyllenhaal)has just been released from prison and is asked to watch out for Sam's wife Grace(Natalie Portman) and children. Sam's aircraft is shot down and is thought to have been killed. Instead the Captain and one of his men are captured and taken prisoner. While Sam is POW status, his brother and lonely wife have become very close...but not physically. Sam returns a different man. His fear and paranoia cause him to be jealous of the relationship between Tommy and Grace. A brother against brother situation develops rapidly and borders a thin line between life and death.

9,dbborroughs,Its the acting that makes this worth seeing in a weak remake,6,22 December 2009,"Tobey Maguire should get an Oscar nomination if not a statue for his portrayal of soldier who does what he has to to get home to his wife and family. The rest of the cast is almost as good in film that is to by the numbers to fully work.The plot has Maguire's character going to war and being shot down. His family thinks he's dead and his brother steps in to help the ""widow"" and her kids. Then he comes home and things are not as happy as they should be.The script doesn't work. Its a three act structure, Act 1 set up, act 2 is the thought he's gone but isn't and act 3 is his return. The film is almost rigidly timed so that each part runs about a half an hour. I was watching my watch and could tell when the acts were switching. Remake aside you can tell where its was going which kind of makes you want them to just get on with it.On the other hand the cast is amazing, especially Maguire who's raging in the final stretch makes him hands down some one you don't want to meet in a dark alley. Its a riveting performance, one of if not the best performance by an an actor I've seen this year. He's the reason to see this film.Worth a look at some point- though it need not be at full movie admission price.",Brothers
10,zardoz-13,Sibling Rivalry,8,10 December 2009,"This hard-hitting, often gripping melodrama about Marine Captain Sam Cahill (Tobey Maguire of the ""Spiderman"" movies) who has to leave his wife Grace (Natalie Portman of the second ""Star Wars"" trilogy) and his two adorable little girls to pull a second tour of duty in Afghanistan is not a lightweight film. Jake Gyllenhaal plays his brother, the bad seed in the family, who gets out of jail about the same time that Sam is heading overseas. Tommy tried to rob a bank but the authorities caught him and he served time. Initially, neither Grace nor her daughters think very highly of Tommy. Sam is flying in a chopper when a missile strikes it and it crashes. When the Marine Corps informs Grace that her husband is missing and presumed dead, Tommy (Jack Gyllenhaal of ""Brokeback Mountain"") sets out to console her. Tommy and his buddies rebuild her kitchen and he wins over the two little girls who started out hating him, just as Grace did. When Sam returns, he is paranoid and delusional and he refuses to discuss his harrowing experiences as a prisoner of war. He saw one of his men tortured and killed in his presence. This movie gets downright chilling at times. If you are looking for an easy-going movie with humor, ""Brothers"" is not for you. Maguire, Gyllenhaal, Portman, and Sam Shepard as the father give memorable performances.""Brothers"" qualifies as a good movie because the characters change over the course of the narrative and ironic surprises occur in the David Benioff screenplay. This is a remake of a 2004 Danish film, but the plot contrivance that one man is presumed dead while another takes over loving his wife is a familiar one. The two little girls that play the daughters do an exceptional job.",Brothers
11,grantss,"OK, but not great",6,10 February 2016,"OK, but not great. Most of the movie is fairly slow moving, overly simplistic, and seems to go nowhere. However, it redeems itself with its ending: very moving and profound.Plot is OK, but direction is fairly unimaginative. Performances are OK on the whole. Natalie Portman and Jake Gyllenhaal do well and the little girls shine. However, Tobey Maguire seems miscast - not for the emotional depth he brings (that was spot-on) but as a Marine captain. He just didn't seem right for that role.I was expecting more from this, so a disappointing movie, for me.",Brothers
12,george.schmidt,Top notch acting by all highlight this gripping war-torn drama,8,4 January 2010,"BROTHERS (2009) *** Jake Gyllenhaal, Natalie Portman, Tobey Maguire, Clifton Collins Jr., Sam Shepard, Mare Winningham, Bailee Madison, Taylor Geare, Patrick Flueger, Jenny Wade, Carey Mulligan, Ethan Suplee. Well acted adaptation of the Swedish film ""Brodre"" with Gyllenhaal and Maguire (both at the tops of their game) as loving siblings who face a unique crises: while Maguire is away at war in Afghanistan – and presumed dead - his ne'er-do-well brother Gyllenhaal steps up to care for his family including his comely yet heartbroken wife (Portman equally fine here). Filmmaker Jim Sheridan, with a competent screenplay by David Benioff, manages to avoid treacle for the most part and succeeds in this compelling Middle East war parable/morality tale largely due to his talented cast.",Brothers
13,ferguson-6,For the Love of Grace,5,6 December 2009,"Greetings again from the darkness. Have long admired director Jim Sheridan's work in such fine films as My Left Foot and the absolute must-see In America. He has a real knack for connecting with the characters and creating a sense of reality. Sadly, this one just doesn't measure up due to the script, the score and the limitations of Tobey Maguire.The basic story is a terrific foundation, but the lousy dialogue and stereotypes just cut this one off at the knees. While the trailer presents this as an extremely intense, emotional story, the finished product is little more than a predictable disappointment with Tobey Maguire sporting bug eyes as he loses his grip.Jake Gyllenhaal's character could have been much better developed and I believe more interaction between he and Maguire would have helped ... and I don't mean another scene of either one of them saying ""You're my brother"". We get that part already. Sam Shepard delivers another of his rare, fine performances as the dad (former military) who seems to connect with his granddaughters and a flask better than his own blood.In case you are wondering, Natalie Portman is beautiful. There are at least two scenes where the characters tell us that ... again, in case you didn't know. Her limitations are just as obvious as Tobey, and the ridiculous, extended shot of her through the kitchen window would have worked as a head shot, but seems totally out of place in the movie.Other than a brief turn from Carey Mulligan (fascinating in this year's An Education), the best thing about the film is Bailee Madison, who plays the eldest daughter. Her range is exceptional. Whether she is backing away in fright from her dad or defiantly squeaking a balloon at the dinner table, she is a master of the moment and something to behold.Sorry, I don't have much positive to say about this one, but I do believe it could have been much better with some script polishing and a replacement for Maguire.",Brothers
14,anaconda-40658,What Pearl Harbor Should Have Been.,10,25 February 2016,"Brothers (2009): Dir: Jim Sheridan / Cast: Tobey Maguire, Natalie Portman, Jake Gyllenhaal, Patrick Flueger, Sam Shepard: This is the film that the dreadful piece of sh*t Pearl Harbor failed to be. It stars Tobey Maguire as a soldier stationed in Afghanistan and the nightmare for which he endured that will forever scar his life. He was believed dead. He has a wife and two daughters as well as a brother who just got released from prison for armed robbery and is trying to redirect his life by helping his brother's family through this trying time. While an affair between his wife and brother is hinted director Jim Sheridan deals with it in a respectable way as oppose to the Michael Bay bullshit where this was exploited. Maguire delivers one of his greatest performances as someone who left as a family man until the tortures of war drew him into a forced repulsive act that drives him to guilt and near madness upon his return. Natalie Portman as his wife struggles to deal with his sudden change and after a crisis that draws police, she will learn the reason for his actions. Jake Gyllenhaal as his brother struggles for acceptance while dealing with jealousy. Patrick Flueger plays Maguire's fellow soldier and friend and the reason for his trauma. Sam Shepard plays the stern father of the two boys and whose attitude poises tension. Theme regards the strength of family in the face of tragedy. Score: 10 / 10",Brothers
15,phd_travel,Good anti war message but unconvincing story,3,22 February 2012,This well intentioned war movie has some good points and bad points.The anti war message is well delivered. The effect on his children and the soldier himself is quite effective. The captivity in Afghanistan was quite tense. Jake and Tobey (the soldier) play the brothers and Natalie plays Tobey's wife.What wasn't convincing was Tobey's reaction of jealousy towards his brother and the rather formula way things played out at the end. It was melodramatic and contrived. The almost romance between Natalie & Jake was predictable.The acting is okay. Tobey is better than expected in the dramatic scenes. THough he seems an odd choice to play an officer. Jake is alright. Natalie is a bit miscast. A bit out of place and sophisticated as an army wife. Should have chosen someone more down to earth looking. Bailee Madison as the cute daughter is adorable but her climactic outburst is too over the top for the story.Overall not a pleasant movie but worth 1 watch if you are a fan of the actors.,Brothers
16,gradyharp,War makes us do such things.....,10,28 March 2010,"It takes extraordinary courage to place a film like BROTHERS before the public, and it is to the credit of director Jim Sheridan that this superb study of the effects of war on everyone around the globe is so fine. Based on Suzanne Bier's Danish film 'Brødre' concerning the same timeframe in the Afghanistan war, this screenplay was successfully adapted by David Benioff from Anders Thomas Jensen's Danish screenplay. It is delivered in somewhat choppy format, throwing the audience one minute in the US and the next in Afghanistan, and while it does take getting used to, this choice of storytelling ultimately works splendidly, heightening the tension in a very steady unrelenting way. The Cahill family consists of alcoholic, Vietnam Vet father Hank (Sam Shepard), stepmother Elsie (Mare Winningham) and two brothers - 'perfect' athlete and successful USCM Captain Sam (Tobey Maguire) and the recently released from prison 'worthless' Tommy (Jake Gyllenhaal). Sam is departing for Afghanistan, leaving his wife Grace (Natalie Portman) and two daughters Isabelle and Maggie (child actress par excellence Bailee Madison and Taylor Geare). Sam entrusts a farewell letter to his best friend Major Cavazos (Clifton Collins Jr.) in case he doesn't return. Sam is off to war and is very soon shot down and taken prisoner by the Afghanis: the report sent home is that Sam has been killed in action. Sam and Private Joe Willis (Patrick Flueger) are starved, beaten, and abused as prisoners until at one hideous moment Sam is instructed to kill the doomed Joe - an act he carries out and absorbs all the subsequent anguish and guilt that results from his act of survival. At home Grace and Tommy become close: the girls love Tommy, Tommy works on Grace's house, and when the report of Sam's death reaches them they are bonded even more tightly - despite Hank's hateful attitude toward the 'failure' Tommy. But when word reaches them that Sam is alive and when Sam returns home, the trials begin. Sam is wasted physically and emotionally, forever devastated by his war experience and his guilt. The story form here on must be seen to understand just how bitterly cruel the aftermath of war can be. This is truly an ensemble movie with every character perfectly cast and giving memorable performances. Few will be able to erase the images that Tobey Maguire, Jake Gyllenhaal and Natalie Portman create - and hopefully those bleak images will force some reality testing on the ongoing question of the 'worth' of war. A brilliant film. Grady Harp",Brothers
17,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: Brothers,8,23 January 2010,"A remake of the Danish film Brodre, what this version boasts is the star presence of Tobey Maguire and Jake Gyllenhaal as the titular brothers Sam and Tommy Cahill, with Natalie Portman starring as the former's wife Grace, in what would be some powerful dramatic performances delivered by all three actors in a story that deals with the pain of loss, the exhilaration of purpose, love and family, and the confusion that comes when jealousy starts to creep in a relationship no thanks to the presence of another man in one's home.Tobey Maguire plays Captain Sam Cahill, who is bidding his family of wife Grace and kids Isabelle (Bailee Madison) and Maggie (Taylor Geare) farewell before he ships out for his tour of duty in Afghanistan. A well respected Marine, he's actually looking forward to this return to the war zone (talk about that addiction to war last seen in The Hurt Locker) to fulfil his belief in the fight for freedom to keep America safe, and is the pride of his parents Hank (Sam Shepard) and Elsie (Mare Winningham) as compared to his good for nothing brother Tommy who's just released from prison, and bumming around to find what he could do when he's out in society.Then comes the tragic news that Sam's Blackhawk helicopter went crashing down into a river, and the devastation that event had on the surviving family members. This of course provided director Jim Sheridan to cover some pseudo-Afghanistan war scenes and making some statements about the war on terror, but also allowed for Portman and Shepard to showcase their acting chops, in particular Portman as you can feel that level of pain with the sudden cutting short of a young person's life, and of course the reverse when excellent, unbelievable news came her way.Brothers is an excellent character study piece which both Maguire and Gyllenhaal fleshed out their roles in stark contrast toward each other and the drawing of parallels in their characters as the film progressed. One's calm and collected, but affected by recent experiences in guilt and blame to finally explode in ""Bale Out"" style, while the other's laissez-faire approach to life suddenly found some purpose when he subconsciously took it upon himself to look after his brother's family, so much so that it borders extremely close to that of being a surrogate husband and substitute father figure, yet endearing himself to the family as he grows into a better, likable person. It is this constant, tense ""will he or won't he"" questioning that will keep you engaged in the film, and then again with the pivotal turning point that will introduce elements of jealousy and needless suspicion into a relationship.There are plenty of memorable scenes in this film, which I thought made it stand out amongst the crowd. One involves all the principal characters gathering over the dinner table in conversation, and the dynamics of everything, and I mean everything, was magic, from how the scene was shot, edited and especially down to the roles that the kids play, with kids Bailee Madison and Taylor Geare almost always stealing the thunder from the veteran actors with their antics. Granted that the assumption of death and how it screws up a relationship is nothing new (heck, even Michael Bay found time to squeeze it into his action packed Pearl Harbor), it boiled down to the excellent performances all round to deliver an emotionally powerful film. You'll feel that intense fury and worry when the film hits its crescendo, and for that alone it's worth the price of an admission ticket. Highly recommended!",Brothers
18,namashi_1,"Well-Made, but way too sad..",5,24 March 2010,"Jim Sheridan's 'Brothers' is a well-made film, but a way too sad, depressing and disturbing fare. It's way too real, it's way too honest. It's a film that caters to a very tiny section of audience! 'Brothers' is a story of a fallen-apart family, the eldest son leaves for war and is pronounced dead. The story then follows on them getting over-it and how relationships combine, while some fall apart. It has a terrific start, an okay middle, but a dull and dry end. It gets way too intense when the unexpected returns and how it all breaks down. These portions are very dark. Moving on, Sheridan's direction is simply awe-inspiring. David Benioff writing is passable. In the acting front, 'Brothers' belongs to Bailee Madison from start to end. The kid is incredible! What a bloody performer! Tobey Maguire is very good. Natalie Portman looks like a goddess and delivers an excellent performance. Jake Gyllenhaal is decent. Sam Shepard is terrific, a superb actor! Others are satisfactory.'Brothers' is meant for those who enjoy dark and off beat cinema.",Brothers
19,StevePulaski,A film that does justice to PTSD rather than its characters,8,26 January 2014,"Sam Cahill (Tobey Maguire) is a Marine captain that has readjusted to his homelife after being deployed to Afghanistan three times now and is about to do his fourth turn of duty within the coming days. Sam has a wife Grace (Natalie Portman) and two beautiful young daughters, Isabelle and Maggie (Bailee Madison and Taylor Grace Geare), whom he loves deeply but hates to leave every few months on relatively short notice. His brother Tommy (Jake Gyllenhaal) has just been released from prison after armed robbery, and Tommy's relationship with their father Hank (Sam Shepard) could not be more distant and contentious, especially seeing how Sam is following in Hank's footsteps of serving his country rather than serving time.Sam is deployed back to Afghanistan in October 2007, but is involved in a helicopter crash, leading news to come back to Grace from Marines saying Sam and several others are now presumed dead. She is obviously heartbroken, as well as her children who need to adjust from having an erratically-present father to no father at all. ""Is daddy dead like your mom and dad,"" one of Sam's daughters asks her mother before the funeral. In a time of grief and mental-exhaustion, Tommy looks to help Grace with the kids and the housework, as well as providing Grace with a person to lean on. In reality, Sam is alive but is taken hostage, along with another Private, by a violent Afghanistan militia. When Sam finally returns home after committing an atrocity, he is stricken with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder symptoms and becomes much more withdrawn from life and out of touch with reality, resorting to strange behavior and explosive episodes of rage and fear.Based off Susan Bier's Brødre, a Danish film, Jim Sheridan's Brothers effectively details, even if in a brazen, melodramatic way, Post Traumatic Stress Disorder amongst our servicemen, and is commanded largely by Maguire, whose screen presence here is powerful and extremely effective. Maguire is up to a grave challenge in this picture, unlike any he has faced as an actor. Very often in the third act must Maguire play detached and cold to the world, which is more than just staring off into space and acting a bit out of the loop. Maguire shows us through his blank stares, dead eyes that are often fixated on something yet nothing, and careful, specific mannerisms that something doesn't feel or look right, making his explosive tirades all the more brutal and harsh. The final twenty minutes of Brothers are some of the finest scenes of Maguire's entire acting career in the way they evoke violent behavior and emotional-overload without being too far-fetched or comedic. You've simply never seem Maguire like you do in the final twenty minutes of Brothers.Gyllenhaal does some exceptional work here too, playing a deadbeat man trying to do right when it seems he can only do wrong. He is the subject of terrible criticism from his father, who views him as nothing more than a waste of a human heart the way he has gotten into trouble and doesn't have the courage or the interest in holding a job and trying to make a decently successful living. Gyllenhaal's scenes with Portman, who we can see tries hard to overcome the battered, distraught woman role, have a pleasant tenderness to them, thanks to the sensitivity Sheridan chooses to capture them with. Sheridan doesn't take advantage of neither performer here, and makes their scenes together shine, particularly one set in a basement with music which makes for a smoothly-conducted dramatic scene. And let us not forget the performances of both of the young child actresses, Madison and Geare, who steal nearly every scene they're in, especially Madison, who has found a way to simultaneously look cute and aware of the heavy circumstances in her family's life.Clearly, Brothers is a film that relies and gets by almost entirely on its performances, leaving David Benioff's screenplay and its contents to sort of take a backseat. Unfortunately, it is difficult to overlook the fact that Benioff has written a screenplay that is often rushed and never really develops its subjects. In the beginning, Sam is only home a depressingly short time before he is quickly shipped back off to Afghanistan before he becomes missing and presumed dead. The film relies on a brief dinner scene between Sam's family as its means for backstory and character development, and mainly uses it to show Sam's father's contention with Tommy. Never do we get a good idea as to what Sam's past tours of duty were like and in what way they affected him. While we never get to know Sam before he became heavily involved with the military, we can tell that perhaps the services had an effect on his mental state, seeing as his movements seem to be very specific and accurate, but in a lesser sense than what they become later.This lack of development sort of derails Brothers in the regard that by the time Sam is mentally-damaged, we still don't have a real grasp on his personality nor his life before combat. Because of this, Brothers feels impersonal at the same time personal, seeing as we are always fixated on this family and how the war has affected not just Sam but his wife, brother, parents, and children as well. What Benioff does do well is make a strong case for the horrifying effects of PTSD and how they can destroy much more than tangible items thanks to fits of rage, and for that, the film is definitely commendable. It isn't until we dig past the surface that we realize that the film doesn't really do all that it could to give us a long-lasting impact.Starring: Tobey Maguire, Jake Gyllenhaal, Natalie Portman, Bailee Madison, Taylor Grace Geare, Sam Shepard, Patrick Flueger, Clifton Collins, Jr., and Mare Winningham.

20,Smells_Like_Cheese,"Over looked, this was a terrific film",10,30 March 2010,"I saw the trailer for Brothers and was just dying to see this movie, sadly the movie didn't have much of a wide release, so I couldn't find a close enough theater that was playing it. So I did have to wait for the rental, but still it was worth it. This is a story that is so different from so many other war films, we're getting a lot of the Iraq war films lately that are about men coming home to a different world and trying to figure out their place in society again. But to see a man start out, as we see in the beginning of Brothers, he's very loved and he loves his family, everything is pretty good. He goes to Afghanistan, goes through ultimate torture, doing anything he can to get back to his family. He goes back to find out that everyone has moved on, thinking he's dead, naturally his family has to learn that they have to move on, but he goes back expecting things to be the same. Such a sad movie, but very much one of the greatest of 2009.Sam and Tommy Cahill are brothers. A Marine about to embark on his fourth tour of duty, Sam is a steadfast family man married to his high school sweetheart, Grace, with whom he has two young daughters, Isabelle and Maggie. Tommy is being released from jail for armed robbery, not long before Sam departs for Afghanistan. Soon news comes that Sam's helicopter has crashed over the water, killing all of the Marines aboard. In reality, he and a hometown friend, Private Joe Willis, have been taken prisoner in a mountain village. With Sam ""dead"", Tommy attempts to redeem himself in the eyes of his family by wrangling old friends to help with kitchen repairs for Grace and the kids. Grace slowly sheds her previous resentment towards her brother-in-law. As months pass, Grace and Tommy bond over their mutual mourning, culminating in a passionate fireside kiss. They regret it afterward, and do not take this attraction any further, though Tommy continues to win the favor of his nieces. Meanwhile, Sam and Joe are abused and tortured by terrorists, forced to make videotaped dismissals of the military and their mission, though only Joe cracks. The captors eventually deem him useless and force Sam, at gunpoint, to beat Joe to death with a lead pipe. Sometime later, Sam is rescued. Sam returns home, clearly traumatized by his experience. He drifts through encounters in a cold, paranoid daze, refuses to explain to his family what happened while he was in Afghanistan.The actors are of course what makes this film so great and I cannot believe how far Tobey Maguire has come, he's always shown potential for great acting, this was his opportunity. I cannot explain, but that final scene with the birthday party where he's loosing it with his daughter who is making a lot of noises and you can tell has favored his brother over him, he just looses it with her and the scene is so beyond intense and heartbreaking. To see him just break down, you know what he's gone through and feel awful for him, then his family who you can't blame at all for trying to grieve and move on thinking he was dead trying to figure a way for things to go back to normal. Jake and Tobey were just incredible, but also I have to give Natalie of course her due, her final scene with Tobey as she begs him to tell her about what happened to him was just gut wrenching as a lot of army wives could probably feel her pain. Brothers is one of the best movies I have seen in the past couple of years, I highly recommend it, it's very intelligent and over looked.10/10",Brothers
21,KineticSeoul,"Boring film and simple film, with a lot of emotion and drama",5,28 April 2010,"This film really isn't for everyone, and I on the majority of people's side that didn't really enjoy this film. The story is very simple to follow, but it drags with emotion and drama. With a budget of $26 million seems to be a bit to much for a film like this cause it's all about the drama and doesn't really seemed like a expensive film to make either, so the budget mainly went to the actors and actress. And although they all put on a fine performance with there acting it just didn't seem to be worth it cause the plot is just too simple and dry. But I guess it's cause the film tries to be realistic and it does achieve that goal in this to some degree because a lot of the scenarios aren't believable. But I guess I am being a bit harsh on this film because real life isn't as exciting and most people watch movies to escape from the real world. The film ain't anything flashy but if you like movies with a lot of emotion and drama, you might like it. I on the other hand probably will not watch this film which feels longer than it's running time ever again. I however did like the aspect of the film where no one is really right or really wrong, except the girl that played the daughter Isabelle Cahill, I wanted to grab her from the screen and throw her out the window that was how irritating she got near the end, but that just shows how good she is at acting. She was still creepy as hell, like some demonic child.5/10",Brothers
22,Buddy-51,a generally faithful remake of the Danish original,7,22 August 2010,"""Brothers"" is an American remake of an excellent Danish drama from 2004. As the title suggests, the story centers on two male siblings who are essentially polar opposites of one another. Sam (Tobey Maguire) is an upright family man and lifelong Marine who has already served one tour in Afghanistan and is all set to embark on a second. Tommy (Jake Gyllenhaal) is a ne'er-do-well ex-con who's released from prison on the very same week Sam is being re-deployed to the battlefield, leaving a wife (Natalie Portman) and two young daughters (the delightful Bailee Madison and Taylor Grace Geare) behind at home. When news comes that Sam has been killed in a helicopter crash, Tommy is there to help pick up the pieces, leading to some potential romantic complications between him and his brother's grieving widow, Grace. But that turns out to be only half the story, as anyone familiar with the Danish version already knows.Written by David Benioff and directed by Jim Sheridan, ""Brothers"" follows the original fairly closely in terms of outline and incident, focusing on one man's attempts to turn his life around after making a mess of things, and another's efforts to come to terms with an action he performed under duress that his conscience will clearly never allow him to live with. The complex relationships among the three principal players - along with Sam's Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder - are dealt with in an adult and thoughtful fashion, with a minimum of melodrama and nary a hint of sensationalism. The conflicts are further exacerbated by the men's father (Sam Shepherd), a hardnosed Vietnam vet whose personal preference for Sam over Tommy has been evident to both boys from very early on in their lives.""Brothers"" reveals its European roots in its more deliberate pacing, its emotional complexity, its lack of judgment towards its characters, and its willingness to leave some loose ends hanging at the end. Maguire and Gyllenhaal are both excellent as the two torn brothers trying to stay close despite their differences - as are Portman, Shepherd and Mare Winningham as the boys' loving and conciliatory step mom whose calming influence over her husband goes a long way towards ameliorating some otherwise potentially volatile situations.",Brothers
23,Robert_duder,"Brilliant performances and an intense, emotionally charged film",8,27 April 2010,"Brothers caught my eye early on when it was released as a dark drama with some terrific young actors. It certainly did not disappoint. If anything the film is exhausting in the best way with emotions running high from beginning to end and yet another play on the current war and how it effects everyone similar to what Stop Loss tried to do. Surprisingly, and perhaps because of the intense emotions throughout the film stumbles quite significantly on the return of Maguire's character after his MIA stint where he was presumed dead. Perhaps we are to assume that much of the emotion, excitement and shock happened off screen but when a film builds itself up as being such intense high adrenaline you feel let down by the ""how ya doin?"" casual return of the son, brother father and husband they thought was dead. It might seem like a small detail and yet when you're watching the film it is a climatic turning point to the entire film and I think they turned an easy perfect score film into slightly less than that. All that being said you won't find a film currently with young, hot actors, in such incredible performances especially the Golden Globe nominated role Maguire plays.Since I've mentioned him twice I'll start with the best. Tobey Maguire is young patriotic family man Sam Cahill. It is quickly established that he has his life on track unlike his trouble ridden brother. Maguire's performance is nothing short of mind blowing. The intense build up to his mental and emotional outburst and breakdown is palpable. This might be the best performance of his career and it isn't to be missed. Jake Gyllenhaal gives a devout and great performance as disturbed brother Tommy. An alcoholic former criminal trying to get his life on track but feels over shadowed by his brother. Gyllenhaal has some amazing scenes of great emotion and the chemistry not only between him and Portman but his on screen sibling Maguire is absolutely outstanding. Both lead males proved they have some incredible acting chops and much ahead of them in their careers. Natalie Portman has a bit of a less emotional role to play...which might be a fault to her character but her subtle, sweet, and mesmerizing performance is no less brilliant. She is beautiful, down to earth and you can see true pain in her eyes as she struggles with everything around her. Sam Shepard is outstanding in a small supporting role as the Cahill father, and Mare Winningham does terrific in a very small role as their mother. Also worth mentioning is the young performance by Bailee Madison as Portman and Maguire's young daughter. She gets some really heart wrenching scenes.Director Jim Sheridan is no slouch. He's been in the industry many years and been nominated for numerous Oscars but he doesn't have a huge resume to his name so obviously he picks and chooses his projects carefully. This is the only film I personally have seen of his but I get the impression he cares deeply for his story. This takes me back to how disappointed I felt and how it felt like it ripped me away from the story to have this beloved character essentially go through horrible torture and his family believe he was dead to finally return and have his brother, wife, children and parents greet him as though he were at the corner store for a year. But putting this aside the film is nothing short of brilliant and it's a must see. The scenes of war are terrifying and the brutality, emotion, and darkness of the film is breath taking. Its intelligence and true depth outshine any random entertainment type film and it will truly make you ponder it for hours afterwords. Don't miss out on this one because it shows three stars in particular who are to surely become Hollywood legends. 8.5/10",Brothers
24,MLDinTN,a war drama that...,7,14 February 2012,"takes place on home soil. This movie was good, but one problem I had was that I don't believe the military would declare a soldier dead so quickly without a body. There would be an investigation and it would take many months to declare someone dead without the body. So, if you can get by that unrealistic part, it is a good drama with good acting. Sam goes off to war leaving behind his wife, Grace, and 2 daughters. His brother, Tommy, whom has never been as good is there to look after them. After his chopper goes down, Sam is declared dead in what seems like just a few days. They have a funeral and everyone moves along with their life. Tommy becomes a father figure for the kids while helping Grace cope. But Sam is really alive and does a horrible thing that is impossible to live with once he is rescued.

The direction which was made by Jim Sheridan was very good and I believe that he did a great job on presenting some major issues of both war and the mentality of soldiers. Regarding the interpretations of the cast, I admit that I was surprised by the interpretation of Tobey Maguire who played as Captain Sam Cahill, and he was simply amazing. Some other interpretations that have to be mentioned were Natalie Portman's who played as Grace Cahill, Jake Gyllenhaal's who played as Tommy Cahill and Sam Shepard's who played as Hank Cahill.

29,zkonedog,Too Understated And Sparse,3,11 March 2017,"Well, here it is again...another one of those situations where the trailer is actually better than the film itself. After viewing that preview for ""Brothers"", I had high hopes that it would succeed where ""Jarhead"" failed in telling the next ""Rambo"" story (this time about the Iraq War instead of Vietnam). Unfortunately, the film was much too understated and sparse to do anything of the sort.The basic premise of the movie sees a young Marine (Tobey Maguire) supposedly die in a helicopter wreck while serving in Iraq. The wife (Natalie Portman) and two daughters he left behind mourn his death, and are comforted by the Marine's brother (Jake Gyllenhaal). When ""Gyllenhaal"" and ""Portman"" get to be a little more than friends, however, the sudden, unexpected return of ""Maguire"" creates a high amount of tension.Here's the problem: If the film had focused on that description (and the one teased to us in the trailer), I think it would have been a much more memorable film. The conceptual love triangle that could have played out would have had the potential to tread on new ground in terms of military pictures, creating a sense of high drama. Instead, though, the ultimate vision of the film focuses far too much on Maguire's mental anguishes and doesn't allow the relationship drama to blossom.SPOILER ALERT: While presumed dead, Maguire is tortured by his enemy, even forced to kill a fellow Marine in cold blood. Thus, when he comes back home, he is a sort of walking zombie of his former self. He isn't able to reconcile his actions and allow himself to slip back into the real world, and even the hint of a Gyllenhall-Portman relationship pushes him over the edge (before that angle has any time to dramatically build).Sadly, in a way, the acting is actually at a very high quality, with the ""lead three"" giving great performances and the auxiliary cast doing a tremendous job in rounding things out (the ""Dad"" and ""oldest girl"" characters are very interesting to watch). However, director Jim Sheridan didn't seem to be able to decide which film he wanted to make: the one about the effects of torture on a Marine's psyche, or the one about how he fits back in with his family after being presumed dead. Sheridan tries to ""go epic"" and do both, but ends up accomplishing neither.Thus, unless you can stand a movie in which many themes are thrown at you that are never really fleshed-out or fully realized in the end, I would recommend staying away from this one. Don't let the trailer fool you...it isn't as gripping as it lets on.",Brothers
30,Floated2,Different take on war drama,7,18 January 2018,"Brothers is apparently a tough war drama starring Tobey Maguire and Jake Gyllenhaal. Much of this story is familiar. There is the father who loves one son, but is ashamed of the other. Tommy (Jake Gyllenhaal) blames his father for his brother's supposed death, filling Sam's (Tobey Maguire) head with a lot of military and patriotic nonsense. Tommy represents the Hollywood view of the war in this movie, while Sam and Hank represent the Red States. This is not an intellectual conflict, but an emotional one, and it plays out in an extremely intense scene.From an acting standpoint, it is quite well. Gylleenhaal steals most of his scenes he's in as his character was more intriguing than Maguire's, though they both do well. As well as Natalie Portman as the wife of Maguire,The direction and production values are very good, but the story does seem to end a bit abruptly. Overall, Brothers may have been overlooked upon its release, it was better than one expected.",Brothers
31,johnnyboyz,Somewhat engrossing and humbling character drama about conflicting emotions towards both people and events.,7,26 April 2010,"Jim Sheridan's 2010 remake of a Danish film from some years ago begins with the raising of the American flag, before a small squad of American soldiers jog by in a training exercise. The opening is all about unity, with the signalling of a few high ranking American marine officials gathering around the raising of the flag evoking an immediate sense of semiology driven notions towards the Iraq War as we then cut to a close knit group of troops running along. Strength and togetherness through a pretty harrowing and harsh crisis is what's put across, nicely teeing up most of the content for Sheridan's film: that sense of a family already on the brink tearing itself further apart as relationships and friendships are strained between three people: understanding, patience and unity the only way in which it can all level out.The film is a tale of a man's struggle to fit back into his prior normal existence, and the woes that it has on those around him dear to him; the sort of story Taxi Driver may have ended up being had Travis been a little richer and came complete with a wife and child to come home to. Anger and regret possesses the lead, a shrewd and somewhat quiet, softly spoken individual living in America with his family in the form of a wife and child; a wandering, floundering brother whom dabbles in criminal activity and elderly parents mostly in the form of a father whom cherish him but seem to discard his sibling. The lead is Sam Cahill (Maguire), a captain in the American marines and one that is sent to the Middle East to help the cause leaving his wife Grace (Portman) and brother Tommy (Gyllenhaal) behind.It's suggested relatively early on that Sam is the 'boy-done-good' of the Cahill family, Sam and Tommy share a truck ride home from Tommy's latest stretch in prison during which a bit of banter is exchanged suggesting this occurs rather often, getting across a sense of exactly the kind of character Tommy is. At dinner that evening, Tommy slouches; child-like in his mannerisms and behaviour, discarding peas and generally acting in a less than adult way. Sam is upright, militarian in his attitude and mannerisms to everything around him and thus establishing a sense of professionalism about him, something that aids in telling us how far he has psychologically sunk when, later on, he will appear to adopt similar militarian routinisms to items in the kitchen before smashing them all up in a fit of rage. Sam's evenings are shot in an angelic manner, and the time he spends with his wife are calming and put across under an aesthetic that's easy on the eye. On the other hand, Tommy's will see him linger in bars - electronic multi coloured signs scattered around in the back ground and rows of liquor bottles in the fore, suggesting a chaotic lifestyle and capturing that down trodden life he leads.Sam's accident and consequent capture in Afghanistan is not a spoiler, nor is the answer to the question as to whether he perished or not. This is not a pot boiler told from the perspective of those back home, although the direction here is so strong that the tension, regret and angst each character back in The States emit when hearing of Sam's accident and disappearance are affecting and involving all the same. More so, it is a character piece about a changed man being placed right back into a, this time, domestic firing line of people and family. Sheridan is no stranger is brooding character studies, and the sequences between Tommy and his father are bread and butter to the man that once captured Gerry Conlon's prison set relationship with his own father in 1993's In the Name of the Father.This is probably the finest slice of acting I've ever seen Tobey Maguire produce, and I came around into buying into Maguire as the elder brother if it didn't mean he played the grizzled ex-con brother. The film then revolves around a core idea of Tommy and Grace's coming together with Sam seemingly dead and gone, a mock-burial service signifying a supposed end to that chapter. Their bonding and coming together is captured like any bonding or coming together would be in this sort of October-set locale, with snowy walks in the wilderness and ice skating sessions with Grace and Sam's kids the order of the day. Intrestingly, Tommy and Grace first encounter one another properly in a room in Grace's house which is being redecorated; that sense or idea of transition first apparent in the changing attitudes they will share with one another as the kitchen downstairs undergoes similar changes signifying some kind of apparent new order becoming evident.The shift the film takes in reintroducing Sam to the text rather effortlessly moves the study of grief and longing the home based characters are suffering back into a study of regret and remorse in the form of Maguire's character. There's something ominous and uneasy about the man when he's back again; his grief upsetting an apparent new order Grace and Tommy have established and an upsetting sense of paranoia combined with angst stricken rage taking over as the new source of conflict. Brothers is a nourishing and tense watch, dramatically unfolding amidst this backdrop of tragedy; grief; regret and raging emotions that these people go through. It balances fear; remorse and bare bones dramatics in the form of two characters just naturally coming together, really rather well, and is worth checking out.",Brothers

At least, this truth is plainly said in the movie, even if it comes from the mouth of cruel moudjahidins: ""this is our country. You have nothing to do here"".The second problem is with the helicopter trash and the burial: the movie doesn't insist on Tobe's corpse and it should have, as his comeback would have been more powerful!The third problem is Tommy's conduct with Natalie. As a brother and uncle myself, I know that in the same situation, i would have never cross the line: Sure, like him, i would put myself to help a lot my single sister-in-law and nephews but it would never involve flirting or intimacy. This said, the cast is just perfect and the family feelings is rightly depicted: When there are siblings, there are always competition, comparisons and this movie is really rich about this. The movie is also interesting as it's dynamic: the initial situation is shattered by Tobe's death and it's again shattered by his comeback. All the characters evolve and show sides that weren't there at first. In this regard, Tobe is surprising: from ideal husband, brother, son, he shows resilience during his captivity and has a terrible breakdown at his return. Coming from my old buddy Pete, it was sad to see him in this state of fury! Natalie is just moving as a loving mother and husband! As for Gyllenhaal, i don't like his usual brag, but he is good here, as he indeed must learn humility.

35,Movie_Muse_Reviews,"Perhaps not unique, but terrifically performed, gripping family drama",8,16 August 2010,"""Brothers"" boasts great dramatic prowess and a trio of talented actors in their prime. The only thing missing is originality. The family drama caused by a father leaving his wife and kids as he's deployed to Afghanistan coupled with the terrors of post-traumatic stress disorder are - - as insensitive as it feels to say -- nothing new, at least to the world of film.Jim Sheridan's intimate film based on the 2004 Danish film from Susanne Bier, creates moments of great drama. Cpt. Sam Cahill (Tobey Maguire) is a devoted marine who on his most recent tour to Afghanistan gets in a helicopter accident and is presumed dead, widowing his wife, Grace (Natalie Portman) and leaving two little girls in the care of with his alcoholic Vietnam vet father (Sam Shepard) and prison parolee brother, Tommy (Jake Gyllenhaal). The trailer makes this out to seem like a more serious version of the film ""Pearl Harbor"" with romantic feelings coming between Grace and Tommy before they know Sam's still alive, but luckily, as much as there might not be surprises, there are no clichés in ""Brothers.""Impressing the most is by far Maguire, who shakes his boyish looks and ""Spider-Man"" related typecasting to portray a young father obsessed with and completely ripped apart by war. At first it's hard to believe Sheridan expects us to see Maguire as the elder brother of Gyllenhaal, but the end of the film Maguire not only has you shaken, but also totally convinced of his character.Portman has a far more typical role in playing Grace and being asked to tackle a pair of scenes where she finds out her husband is dead and then again when her husband is alive. She's excellent as the fragile but not outwardly so ""widow,"" but her talents could be better utilized in a more complex character. Regardless, she's spot on.If there were a Best Performance by a Child Oscar, I think hands down 10-year-old Bailee Madison as the older sister Isabelle would've won it. For someone her age, the complexity of her portrayal and ability to show exactly what she's feeling without overdoing it is amazing. Her character is incredibly mature and she is equally so. Isabelle is the child that knows what's going on and has some issues with wanting attention.The only reason ""Brothers"" was passed on at the Academy Awards was simply that it was straightforward. Maguire was probably inches from a nomination, but the film on the whole doesn't offer a formative experience. For intense family drama, however, not many will beat it.~Steven CVisit my site http://moviemusereviews.com",Brothers

37,meeza,Oh Brother! This one was intense!,9,21 December 2009,"Oh Brother where art though? Well my reader brothers & sisters from other mothers & fathers, I must say that some of that cinematic art is found in the gripping drama ""Brothers"". The film stars Tobey Maguire as Spiderman and Jake Gyllenhaal as Spiderman's long lost superhero brother Lobsterman. OK, I am kidding! But that would of have been a great pitch. ""Brothers"" does star lookalike actors Tobey Maguire and Jake Gyllenhaal as.; Yes, you guessed it. Brothers! Maguire plays Sam Cahill, a Marine Captain husband and father of two girls. Gyllenhaal plays his delinquent brother Tommy who has been much of an immature Tommy Boy throughout his entire life by getting into trouble with the law. Tommy is out of prison and trying to redeem himself by playing responsible little brother in caring for Sam's family after Sam is pronounced dead during his fourth tour-of-duty in Afghanistan. My brotherly advice for Tommy is not to get too close to Sam's knockout wife Grace just in case Sam is not really dead. And by goodness gracious that is exactly what happens: Tommy makes a pass at Grace; Sam is not really dead but was seized by Aghan terrorists and somehow was able to survive that horrific turmoil; and he returns as a walking dead reincarnation of Son of Sam. A psychotic looking Sam suspects that Tommy has been using his organic Tommy Gun on Grace and domestic & family chaos erupts. I will not be a spoiler brother by providing more plot lines on ""Brothers"", but I will say that you will not be disappointed. Veteran Director Jim Sheridan helms ""Brothers"" with authentic precision in all facets of the narrative from the gruesome realities of present war to the mental instability that it causes on our brave soldiers upon returning home. Screenwriter David Benoiff also delivered a precise script. The ensemble acting of ""Brothers"" was nothing short of outstanding: Maguire and Gyllenhaal were spectacular in their starring roles even though I do give the edge to Brother Jake in that department. I give grace to Natalie Portman's performance as the grieving & lonely wife/presumed widow Grace. This was one gorgeous amazing Grace! Portman continues to be a stunner. Sam Shepard was a Good Acting Shepard in his portrayal as Sam & Tommy's marine veteran father Hank Cahill who sees Sam as a brave soldier and Tommy as a useless offspring; maybe the name had something to do with it! And child actress Bailee Madison was no Billy Madison with her impressive turn as Sam & Grace's eldest child Isabelle. ""Brothers"" did not have a brotherly effect on me at first, but it stayed lingering in my cerebral cortex for days, and that my brothers is the definite proof of powerful film-making. ***** Excellent",Brothers
38,MaxBorg89,Solid but not entirely necessary remake,7,27 March 2010,"Of all the remakes being spawned by Hollywood, Brothers is perhaps the least infuriating on paper: after all, the original Danish film tackled a very American subject, namely war, and told a story that works in pretty much any language. In addition, the US version benefits from a good director (Jim Sheridan, recovering from Get Rich or Die Trying'), a reliable screenwriter (David Benioff) and a solid cast. Not enough to improve on the prototype, but still a solid effort.The script is basically the original translated in English: Sam Cahill (Tobey Maguire), loving husband and father, is going to Afghanistan on a mission. When he's reported dead (his team disappeared and no bodies were found), his wife Grace (Natalie Portman) and his two daughters receive support from an unlikely source: Sam's younger brother Tommy (Jake Gyllenhaal), freshly out of jail and looking for a way to prove himself worthy of the family's trust. Soon, emotions get complicated between him and Grace, a problem that gets even more serious once Sam is revealed to be alive and comes back home.Benioff's take on Susanne Bier's tale of brotherly love follows the blueprint quite closely, but adds another layer of subtext that makes the picture more American: given the rigorous, almost religious connotations the army, and especially the Marines, can have in the US (see Full Metal Jacket and A Few Good Men), not to mention the tradition of sons taking after their fathers, a different back-story explaining the troubled relationship between the Cahill boys and their veteran father (Sam Shepard) is a welcome modification. Less successful, on the other hand, is Sheridan's decision to give the film a more ""cinematic"" look, ditching the hand-held style that made the Danish counterpart more realistically affecting. Granted, it would have looked like a shot-for-shot remake, but the subject's poignancy suffers as a result.Another problem, perhaps even more serious, is the age of the three stars: being between ten and fifteen years younger than their Danish equivalents, Maguire, Portman and Gyllenhaal deliver solid, compelling performances (Maguire in particular is miles away from Spider-Man's blockbuster territory), but almost always look too young to convince as a family torn apart by war (and frankly, it's hard to buy Sam and Grace as parents of two seven-year old girls). Amusingly, this is referenced in the screenplay, when Sam, sensing that things have changed, describes his wife and brother as ""two teenagers in love"" (in fairness, though, that line, like much of the dialogue, is taken verbatim from the original).In short, Brothers is a worthy showcase of its cast's acting talents (alongside the leads, Carey Mulligan does wonders with what is basically a throwaway cameo) and a reasonably strong reflection on the consequences of war, but it pales next to the superior European version.",Brothers
39,estebangonzalez10,A melodrama saved by great performances,7,8 August 2010,"¨I don't know who said 'only the dead have seen the end of war'. I have seen the end of war. The question is: can I live again? ¨ Jim Sheridan directs this melodrama that focuses on family and the impact war has on all of it's members, not just the soldiers. Most of Sheridan's films focus on family, such was the case in In the Name of the Father, In America, and The Boxer. In Brothers the main problem Sheridan had to face was that there were two other war movies released during the same year that had much more critical success: Oscar winner The Hurt Locker and The Messenger, and out of the three Brothers was the weakest. Brothers was based on the 2004 danish film of the same name written and directed by Susanne Bier. The screenplay for this American version was written by David Benioff. The story may seem a little forced during some scenes, such is the case when the family is dinning together for Maggie's birthday near the end of the movie and Isabelle bursts and says something that doesn't feel real because it is not something a little girl would say. Some scenes were just forced for more melodramatic effects. Many people might be divided over the story, some liked it a lot others hated it, but what no one can deny is that the performances were great. Toby Maguire gives the performance of his career and I think he really deserved an Oscar nomination, but I guess the Academy didn't think so since they had already nominated Renner for The Hurt Locker and Harrelson for The Messenger. I thought the kitchen breakdown scene by Maguire was one of the best of the year. Natalie Portman was excellent as well, the two child actresses were really believable, and Jake Gyllenhaal gives his best performance since Brokeback Mountain. Brothers is a movie I enjoyed more because of the performance from the cast then the actual story.Sam Cahill (Tobey Maguire) is a Marine Captain who has to return to Afghanistan for his second tour in a few days. Meanwhile he is enjoying time with his family back home: his beautiful wife Grace (Natalie Portman), and his two young daughters Isabelle (Bailee Madison) and Maggie (Taylor Geare). Before leaving for Afghanistan Sam gets to pick up his younger brother, Tommy (Jake Gyllenhaal), from jail and brings him home. The family gets together for dinner along with Sam's parents Hank (Sam Shepard) and Elsie (Mare Winningham). Tension between Hank and Tommy is felt from the first moment they sit together for dinner as Hank always speaks well of Sam and criticizes Tommy for always being trouble. Sam has a good relationship with his brother and always tries to defend him. Sam leaves for Aghanistan and suffers an accident on one of his missions. Two marines visit Grace and let her know that Sam has passed away, but the truth is that he has survived and been taken prisoner by Afghan rebels, but we are the only ones who know this because the director has decided to share this information with us. Meanwhile Grace is devastated and tries to be strong for her two young daughters who she really loves. Tommy is also devastated by his brother's loss and decides to help Grace out with the kids and remodeling the kitchen. As time goes by Tommy's relationship with Grace and the kids grows and he even seems to redeem himself in his father's eyes. While Tommy is reconstructing his life, Sam is being tortured and suffering physical and psychological damage, and we are waiting for him to be rescued and see what happens.The movie is mildly successful because of the performance from the entire cast. The story suffers from being a bit melodramatic, but it is still worth a watch. It is mostly a character driven film as we see how war takes its toll on family. Sam was a great husband and loving father before the incident, and Tommy was kind of the black sheep in the family. Sam's supposed death brings a reversal of roles as Tommy takes care of the kids and befriends them while giving Grace the emotional support she needs. Sam on the other hand suffers so much psychological pain that he changes completely because he was forced to do things he never imagined possible. During the movie I was really hoping this wouldn't turn out to be another Pearl Harbor as we could see the events unfolding before our eyes, but Sheridan stays away from that and focuses on the psychological impact on the family. I know I haven't stopped repeating how much I enjoyed the performance from the cast, but I was truly surprised by the two child actresses who really were great on screen. It was the best performance by children on screen I have seen in quite some time. This movie is worth your time for the solid acting although the plot has its weak moments.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/",Brothers
40,mattkratz,definitely worth seeing,9,11 January 2012,"This was an interesting movie with underlying messages-it was about more than just war and relationships. It starts off with Tobey Maguire playing a Marine who is about to be shipped off to a tour in Afghanistan. Just before this, he springs his screw-up brother (Jake Gylenhaal)from jail, and everyone says goodbye to him over supper. On his way to the site, Maguire's helicopter gets shot down, and he is presumed dead. Gyhenhaal (whom nobody in the family likes-you should hear the things the family members say to him at supper and at the funeral!) tries to turn his life around and make amends with everyone by filling in and looking over the family.Meanwhile, of course, Maguire isn't dead. He has been taken hostage and is being severely tortured by the Taliban. He is finally rescued and, upon returning, clearly suffers from post traumatic stress syndrome.Both men are turned around by their new environments. I think this is a movie about nature vs. nurture. It is a little bit like the Dustin Hoffman movie Hero. Everyone (Maguire, Gylenhaal, Natalie Portman-great cast!) is excellent in this movie.*** out of ****",Brothers

The movie itself isn't perfect but the performances overshadow a weak screenplay and strange lack of depth (considering the subject matter)It was the character development that genuinely got me invested here along with a stand out turn from Tobey Maguire. Wow. Jake Gyllenhaal also does a good job and while I like Natalie Portman I felt that her character was kind of flat and aloof considering the emotions her she should have been going through. I actually got more from her oldest daughter who brought me to tears.Outstanding sub cast as well in Sam Shepard and Mare Winningham who round out the layers to this dysfunctional family.Tobey Maguire plays Sam Cahill, a marine who is believed to be killed while serving a second tour in Afghanistan. Jake Gyllenhaal is his deadbeat younger brother Tommy who has just been released from prison and becomes an unexpected source of support for Sam's grieving wife Grace.The movie alternates between Grace and Tommy back in the States and Sam who has been captured and is experiencing starvation and unbearable tortures in Afghanistan by the Taliban. He eventually returns home a very changed man, suffering PTSD and convinced his wife and brother have slept together. The confrontation to this matter is powerful stuff, wasn't sure how it was going to play out. Worth watching just for the incredible performance from Toby Maguire. 9/8/15",Brothers
42,davispittman,Solid acting but troubling morality,7,19 March 2017,"OK my feelings about this film is a mixed bag. First of all, I have to say that the acting from everyone involved especially Maguire is very solid, really intense and explosive at times. Portman and Gylanhaal are good too, it's just that Tobey Maguire has the moments that are much more intense and his acting ability is showcased. The dialogue was very good and told us a lot about the characters. Character depth was very deep and real in this film, which is good since it's such a crucial thing in a film of this kind. The movie has a whole lot in its favor and those things should be recognized and praised. The thing that just really bothers me about the movie though is the very ending. A character does something horrible earlier in the movie and yes I understand they were in an extremely difficult situation, but what they did was absolutely horrible and I see absolutely no justification for it. The movie closes with an unclear answer on whether that person will get off on it or not, but I certainly hope not, because what they did has affected others and was just awful. So overall, a well made drama but this once character's morality was very screwed up and that disturbs me very much because it was such an unjustifiable act. Watch and see if you agree. 7/10.",Brothers

44,Samiam3,"Strong in parts, but overall it's incomplete",6,20 April 2011,"Brothers has all the talent it needs, but unfortunately the movie doesn't come alive till the last half hour. I suppose it's curious, seeing as the climax is where most movies fall apart, whereas with Brothers, it comes together. The question is whether it justifies using a full hour for nothing but set up.The film is essentially about recovery, a topic which never offers many surprises, especially here. Despite compelling acting across the board, nobody ever gets enough of a chance to grow. The first two thirds of Brothers are kind of mopey, under written, and poorly assembled. We are introduced to the family of marine captain Sam Cahill who is being recalled to Afgahnistan shortly after his brother Tommy (the family black sheep) has gotten out of jail. shortly after Cahill re-enters the battlefield he is taken as a POW, while back home, he has been reported dead, and Tommy, for the first time in his life, is put in the position of a father, and decides to connect. The catalyst for the story comes in rather late, and involves an incident where Sam, held at gunpoint is forced to do a very terrible and disgracing thing. after which, he is rescued and borough home, but needless to say, the weeks of captivity have made him a changed man, almost unable to speak. His wife and kids don't recognize him, and Tommy now feels betrayed. Around here is where the dynamics get interesting, particularly so in a scene at the dinner table during one of the kid's birthday parties. Brothers starts out as kind of generically plot driven, but ends as a kind of character based movie. It's a team effort on the part of the cast, and everyone pulls their weight, but they might just be too good for the bulk of the material. Simply because Brothers takes too long to get going, it ends up feeling partial and under fleshed. The movie almost works, but not quite.",Brothers

While Sam's brother, ex-convict Tommy (Jake Gyllenhaal), decides to comfort Grace, slowly and unintentionally the two fall for each other. After Sam is recovered from capture the would-be widow and the prodigal son must now cope with the conflicting feelings as well as the remnants of a man, that returned from Afghanistan.""Brothers"" is extremely poorly scripted, so having not seen the original version, it is hard to place blame on either Bier or Benioff as to where the responsibility lies. However certain similarities between this movie and ""Haevnen"" seem to point to culpability on both persons. As in the Oscar winning ""Haevnen"" foreign countries are used instrumentally as a plot device, nurturing all the worst stereotypes necessary in order to deliver some context for what happens in the 'civilized world'. This in itself is pretty appalling with Afghans unanimously portrayed as spineless despicable torturers and murderers, just so that Sam can have appropriate trauma after returning to the States. This essentially cause the whole foreign content of the movie to be tiresome, obtrusive and severely flawed, while at the same time not visibly most scenes not serving much purpose (the whole captured events are overdrawn and pointless and could have been sufficiently supplanted with one-two nicely constructed scenes).What goes on in the States is an equally frustrating watch with trivial and shallow interactions predominant, so despite best intentions by Gyllenhaal and Portman the predominant soap quality of dialogue disrupt build-up. For what seems a Benioff retcon the two never actually sleep together, just exchange a single kiss, but still seem unable to discuss this with Sam on his return, while Isabelle explicitly uses lies about sexual relations between Grace and Tommy to vent frustration. There is however still one poignant culmination scene during Maggie's birthday, rife with emotions, context, acting, dynamics and tension, that makes the movie worth a watch. The promise suggested by that scene alone does also inspire to check out the original Danish movie for comparison and maybe watching a piece, which actually delivers on its promise.",Brothers
47,raulfaust,"The good & bad of ""Brothers""",7,2 August 2011,"Well, first I'd like to say I haven't seen the original and I find it pointless to compare them.Good things: the photography is beautiful, the cast is believable and professional, the daughters are very cute, it entertains for the most part (which is hard in a drama nowadays) and provokes a good thought about ""learning to kill"".Bad things: people in this film are quiet and limited in their conversations. They just answer what has been asked and say no more, leaving the two characters looking at each other silently for many seconds, which isn't very common in real life. Also, the Sam's madness scene could have been easily avoided; right after his daughter say those things, Grace, Tommy and the daughters could have talked to Sam and explained it was a lie because the little girl was mad at him. Any reasonable person in the world would've done that to avoid an explosion scene.But now I digress. I really want to understand how some people can get so furious when arguing in a relationship. I know many couples that have these violent fights, where they scream and break things all over. Maybe it's because I've been single for years, but I really don't get all this angry.",Brothers

This isn't really one of my favorite genres, because movies about the psychological toll of war can often be heavy-handed. Brothers keeps the message centered on war families and the very real problems that they can (and do) face without making moral judgments. That's one of the main things I liked about this film.The other thing that I enjoyed enough to mention was the performances. I haven't been this impressed with Natalie Portman since The Professional, and I've NEVER been this impressed with Jake Gyllenhaal. Tobey Maguire was great as well, and he shares much of the acting burden with Portman. He had to go deep and dark in this one, and he did it well. My respect for all three of them as actors has increased, thanks to their work here. On the not so sunny side, the movie didn't handle the relationship between the two siblings nearly as well as it could have. It's called Brothers, but in actuality, the film focuses on the two brothers quite separately. The story always seemed be about one of them alone and rarely did they both get the primary focus. The first half was almost all Jake, and the likewise with the latter half and Maguire. I assume that wasn't the attention of director Jim Sheridan, but that was the result.Brothers was a pleasant surprise for me.

They could have filled in all the before stuff with flashbacks. That would have made for a better story. The title is Brothers, but for this story, that didn't seem to fit. Just saying ""you're my brother"" from time to time really didn't get me into a warm fuzzy feeling between these two.

50,fntstcplnt,Brothers (2009),7,21 March 2020,"Directed by Jim Sheridan. Starring Jake Gyllenhaal, Natalie Portman, Tobey Maguire, Sam Shepard, Bailee Madison, Taylor Geare, Mare Winningham, Clifton Collins Jr., Patrick Flueger, Ethan Suplee, Arron Shiver, Ray Prewitt, Jenny Wade. (R)Harsh but reasonably compelling drama about desolation, jealousy, unbearable guilt, loneliness, the psychological scars of war (so, not quite the feel-good film of the year). US Marine captain Maguire has a loving wife (Portman) and two precocious daughters (Madison, Geare), as well as a ne'er-do-well brother (Gyllenhaal) who just finished a prison stint for armed robbery. During a tour of duty in Afghanistan, Maguire's helicopter is shot down and he's presumed dead; while trying to provide aid and comfort, Gyllenhaal grows close (very close) to the family. Director Sheridan, working from a script by David Benioff, faithfully remakes the Danish film of the same name, but gives it a little too much gloss; although providing a respite from the gloom, ""lighter"" scenes (often featuring the little girls or Gyllenhaal's handymen buddies) are shoehorned clumsily. The lead performances are all on point, with Maguire's sheltered darkness magnifying his harrowing pain; as the gruff father openly showing favoritism among his boys, Sam Shepard plays the Sam Shepard role. Carey Mulligan has a bit part as a soldier's wife.70/100",Brothers
51,dunmore_ego,Broham Interruptus,8,20 August 2011,"Don't you just hate it when your brother goes off to war and he supposedly gets killed, and you start putting the moves on his wife, and then he comes back? Don't you just hate that?! What separates Jim Sheridan's BROTHERS from Michael Bay's PEARL HARBOR (same plot, different war) is that BROTHERS is watchable. Starring Tobey Maguire as Marine Captain Sam Cahill and Jake Gyllenhaal as his renegade brother Tommy (didn't Kirsten Dunst's Breasts get so confused over their resemblance that she slept with both of them?) and Natalie Portman as Grace, the hot grieving wife. Their father (cantankerous Sam Shepard) is a dismissive, abrasive Viet Nam vet, who frowns on Tommy getting out of jail and smiles on Sam leaving on yet another Afghanistan tour.Based on the Danish film BRØDRE (by Susanne Bier and Anders Thomas Jensen), Jim Sheridan directs BROTHERS with a subtle hand, playing against the inevitable. We know the story going in, so the storytelling does not unfold as conveniently as expected.The movie is sold on its brilliant performances. Watch for all the little details, the human interactions.Tommy tries to move past his directionless, drunken life, finding a purpose in comforting Grace just by being there; Grace coping with the loss of her husband yet having to raise two scathingly cute little girls (Bailee Madison and Taylor Geare) who are tremendous actresses and have a solid future of irresponsible tattooed Hollywood boyfriends and detox facilities to look forward to.BROTHERS switches between Sam's torture scenes in Afghanistan and Sam's brother Tommy casually cultivating his wife Grace in the States. The truth is, the Afghanistan scenes bore. We've seen it all before and it adds nothing to the story. War is hell, right? Do we really need to cutaway to Sam and his private in a cave so many times? Sam is eventually forced - by the Generic Bearded Oily Guys - to either kill his private or be killed. ""Hero"" that he is (all military guys are heroes, right?), he repeatedly slams a metal pipe onto his private's head to preserve his own life. What would YOU have done? Death Before Dishonor, right? Wouldn't a true hero have given up his life for his friend?...The problem with BROTHERS (which I also consider a commendation, because it deviates from Hollywood protocol) is that it puts us on the road to romance, with the subtle looks and meaningful silences between Grace and Tommy - eventually they share but one guilty pleasure kiss - but then like a needle scratching across a record, Sam comes back, driving us unbidden back into the bland mundanity of marriage. And despite its heavy, disturbing scenes with Sam going bonkers over his wife's imagined infidelity, it pretty much ends on that bland note - of Grace taking Sam back because familiarity denotes she stand by her man, with Tommy completely ousted. It's very sad, because the real ""hero"" was Tommy, the guy who atoned for his past sins, and was aiming at being a good provider and surrogate father, rather than the guy who killed his private to preserve his own life, smashed his kitchen while accusing his wife of screwing his brother and scarred his children and neighborhood by being surrounded by police and firing his gun into the air like an asshole.BROTHERS is about the consequences of war, not the causes. Though set in 2007, it doesn't explore the politics of Bush-Cheney's fake war on terror, rather focuses on the Post Traumatic Stress Disorder that those swine caused in millions of otherwise average men and women.The greatest scam the American Military pulls on its volunteers is that it fools them into believing they are fighting for the type of life they are leaving behind, while simultaneously flensing them of all aspirations to return to that life.Though he is receiving counseling at home (which the movie never shows us), Sam requests of his superior (Clifton Collins Jr.) to be assigned back to Afghanistan! It is not so much the horrors of the fake war that have affected him or that he cannot relate to his closest loved ones, it is that he has been conditioned so effectively as a military cog that he knows no other form of existence.Volunteering to kill people, by definition, is anti-social, and only weak-willed latent sociopaths would do so. Cue rationalizations, so as not to appear weak-willed and sociopathic. When a military person returns home with PTSD, it's not because being in war made them unable to cope with society, it's because being in war gave license to their actual personality which is necessarily stultified in society upon their return. And to paraphrase Freud, Repression is a bitch.In the case of Sam (played by Tobey Maguire with glazed-eyed conviction, disturbing acrimony and a severe jarhead haircut) why is it not considered that maybe his family life was actually repressing a darker, wilder side that his brother acted out on? In acting out his demons, his brother seemed much more adjusted.Don't you just hate it when you live your whole life well-adjusted and the person who becomes maladjusted, murders people under the illegal sanction of ""war"" and then costs the State and taxpayers hundreds of thousands of dollars in rehabilitation and special needs facilitators just to get back to a state of adjustment that your stronger brain was always at - is considered the Hero?

54,Philby-3,The Irish make good American storytellers,8,29 March 2010,"CAUTION: Possible spoilers The Irish director Jim Sheridan knows how to tell a story (""My Left Foot"" and ""In the Name of the Father"") and he makes good use of his talents in this re-make of a Danish Dogme style film ""Brode"" originally directed by Suzanne Bier. The story here is of two brothers, one an upright (and uptight) soldier in the Marine core (Tobey Macguire), the other a shiftless ex-con (Jake Gyllenhaal), whose relationship is altered for the better after the soldier suffers trauma in Afghanistan. At first, Tobey is reported killed, and Jake, almost without thinking about it, moves to take his place. Then when Tobey turns up, having had his mind seriously messed with by the Taliban, Jake helps him through some pretty bad moments. Jake gets close to both Tobey's perky children and his improbably beautiful wife (Natalie Portman) but he manages to stay out of her bed.Their crusty old ex- Marine father, played by Sam Shepherd, with his constant put-downs of Jake and uncritical admiration of Tobey, is clearly part of Jake's problem. Ultimately though, the brothers have to work things out between themselves.The story is well put together though some of the Afghanistan scenes were rather awkwardly inter-cut with the action back home. Jim Sheridan doesn't examine the right and wrongs of the US being in Afghanistan except to have a Taliban translator tell Tobey ""you shouldn't be in our country"". That might be a no-brainer as far as Iraq is concerned but Afghanistan is a different case – for that matter Mohammed Atta and his friends shouldn't have been in the US on 9/11. Anyway, Sheridan is more interested in the personal story of the brothers and he tells this in absorbing fashion.Tobey and Jake are fine as the brothers and Natalie Portman puts in a good performance as Tobey's wife, as do Bailee Madison and Taylor Geare as her two young daughters. I thought the story was set in Minnesota but it seems location filming was done in New Mexico where it also snows in winter (but is not quite so cold). I haven't seen the Danish film but this version stands up well on its own, is likely to have better production values, and of course it is more accessible to an American audience.",Brothers
55,hall895,Doesn't reach its potential,5,16 January 2016,"Brothers is a movie which has the pieces to succeed but those pieces do not end up coming together to form a satisfying whole. The story is certainly compelling. Natalie Portman and Jake Gyllenhaal are reliable performers who are certainly capable of making something good out of the material. The whole production is in the hands of well-respected director Jim Sheridan. The movie should work. But it really doesn't. You can see the potential here but Brothers falls well short of what it could have been.Portman and Gyllenhaal do fine work but the key performer in Brothers is Tobey Maguire. And therein is the first problem with the film. Maguire never really convinces in the role. He plays Marine captain Sam Cahill, who as we meet him is about to head out for another tour of duty in Afghanistan. He'll be leaving behind his wife, Grace, and their two young daughters. Also left behind is Sam's brother, Tommy, the black sheep of the family. Tommy just got out of prison, he's always drunk, he's a complete loser. Sam loves his brother but nobody else wants to deal with Tommy. His own father, a military man who worships Sam, despises him. Sam's wife is disgusted by Tommy and does not want him around at all, ever. With Sam gone, Tommy will be rudderless, left to fend for himself. And then things get a lot worse. In Afghanistan, Sam's helicopter crashes. Sam is dead.Only we see right away that Sam is not dead at all, he survived the crash and was taken prisoner by the Taliban. Which begs the question of why the U.S. military was in such a hurry to tell Sam's family that he was dead. Anyhow, while Sam's family tries to carry on and cope with his death the very much alive Sam does whatever he has to do to survive to try to get back to his family. The movie proceeds on these parallel tracks. What will happen if these tracks come together, if the ""dead"" Sam comes home? Certainly an interesting situation but there is the sense the movie fails to make the most of it. With Sam supposedly dead Tommy cleans up his act. He tries to help Grace around the house, grows close with her and her kids. It's a nice redemption story but uncomfortable for obvious reasons, especially as we keep cutting back to the trials and tribulations of Sam in Afghanistan. And, as you might expect when one is imprisoned by the Taliban, those are some pretty nasty trials.There is the sense the movie chickens out a bit, Grace and Tommy never go as far with their relationship as you might expect them to. It becomes more about Tommy's relationship with Grace's kids. Sam's kids. The kids come to love Uncle Tommy, accepting him as more or less a new father. So what happens if the old father comes back? Awkward. And not just awkward, potentially frightening because after what he's been through Sam is not the same man he once was. The loving husband and father, the heroic Marine...that Sam is gone. He's a shell of the man he once was. How this all plays out ultimately is disappointing. You buy into Maguire as the nice Sam at the film's beginning. The not-so-nice Sam we see later on Maguire struggles with. The actor doesn't fit the role. He's trying really hard. Too hard. Rage and fury just don't come naturally to Maguire it seems, he's overacting trying to pull it off and it's just not believable. Portman, playing Grace, and Gyllenhaal, playing Tommy, are good. They work well with one another and they play off of Maguire well. Their reactions to Maguire work, Maguire himself doesn't. The story has some failings in the end, seen most clearly at a family birthday party where everybody behaves in ways which are hard to believe. It eventually comes to a big dramatic, climactic (though overacted) head...and then the movie just kind of ends. There is very little in the way of resolution. For a movie which seemed to hold great promise in the end there is not much satisfaction.",Brothers
56,KnightsofNi11,Too much melodrama holds back a potentially great film,7,13 June 2012,"Melodrama is that thing which I always go back and forth on. Sometimes it works perfectly for a movie. Other times it is too much and ruins a film's meaningful message it might have had. And then sometimes it falls right in between. This is the case for Jim Sheridan's Brothers a film about a family who is gravely affected by war in ways we haven't quite seen before. Jake Gyllenhaal plays Tommy and Tobey Maguire plays Sam. The two are brothers and, after sam is presumed dead while fighting in Afghanistan, Tommy cares for Sam's wife Grace. Thing's are shaken up with Sam returns home, shattering the foundations of what was growing between Sam's wife and kids and Tommy. This is one of those films that is full of tears, yelling, and high impact drama. Themes of family and relationships run strong through it, albeit a little heavy handed because of, you guessed it, the melodrama.Brothers is a film with the best of intentions. It aims to be an incredibly powerful film with an unforgettable story. It is undoubtedly heartfelt and quite engaging. However, there are some things holding it back from the potential it wants to achieve. First off, Tobey Maguire is horribly miscast in his role. His and Gyllenhaal's roles probably would have been better off if they were reversed because Maguire simply isn't believable as the hard boiled and straight edge military captain. His performance is more awkward than powerful. In the quintessential scene of the film he acts his heart out but gives it just a little too much for the audience to feel any empathy. If you had to point fingers as to why this film wasn't as good as it could have been, all fingers will likely be pointing to Maguire.But I can't say that he ruins the film by any means. In fact, nothing ruins this film because it is actually pretty good. It simply could have been better. It's the kind of film that you watch and are entertained by in the moment, but there isn't much to reflect on in retrospect. This is because Brothers only achieves the level of drama that we watch, rather than feel. You don't develop a lot of sympathy for these characters and you don't care about what happens to them as much as you should. Rather, you only watch the film to enjoy it for the hour and forty minutes that it lasts. Brothers tries much too hard to be more than this and it force feeds a lot of the emotion we are expected to feel.I can give the film credit for keeping my attention and keeping me enthralled in the events of the film, but I can't say I was deeply moved by anything that happens. It's just too much melodrama, and it holds back what could have been an excellent film. But, all in all, I don't regret watching Brothers, but I certainly wouldn't do it again.",Brothers
57,ajs-10,One stand-out performance in this gritty drama...,8,29 March 2011,"This is another film that got quite a bit of attention from the critics when it first came out. Given the fact that they generally know a bit more about film than I do, I decided to give it a try when it appeared in the TV schedules. Based on a Danish film of the same name that came out in 2004, it is, at times a very gripping and, at the same time, a very touching story of two brothers. I found it pretty good, not least for one stand-out performance, but more of that later. Here's a brief summary first (summary haters and those that don't wish to know anything about the plot please help fix the kitchen while I write the next paragraph).Sam Cahill is a Captain in the Marines; he has a wife, Grace, and two young daughters, Isabelle and Maggie. At the beginning of the film he is about to deploy to Afghanistan. At the same time his brother, Tommy is just getting out of Jail. Their father, Hank, is a Viet Nam vet and makes it clear that he disapproves of the way Tommy has lead his life. Sam goes off to Afghanistan and Grace and the girls go about their normal lives. Tommy turns up every now and then, but Grace doesn't really like him. Then the news comes that Sam is dead and Grace is devastated. Tommy, feeling guilty spends more and more time with her and the girls and they become quite attached to him. SPOILER ALERT Little do they know, but Sam is alive and being held captive in the mountains of Afghanistan. Eventually he is rescued, after suffering at the hands of his captors and being forced to do things he would rather forget, Will he be able to live with his wife and family again? Will they be able to live with him having thought him dead? Well, I guess I'd better not tell you or the Spoiler Police will be after me.This is a really well made film with, surprisingly, a great musical score; it really stunned me how good it was! I'm not sure on the setting, but it looked, and felt, very cold. Performance wise, well, by far the best performance came from Tobey Maguire as Capt. Sam Cahill, he really pulled all the stops out and went way up in my estimation. Both Jake Gyllenhaal as Tommy Cahill and Natalie Portman as Grace Cahill were also very good. It was nice to see Sam Shepard as Hank Cahill and Mare Winningham as Elsie Cahill. Finally, a special mention for Bailee Madison as Isabelle Cahill and Taylor Geare as Maggie Cahill, both young actresses were very good also.I was quite surprised just how good this film was. I was prepared for a bitter wordy drama all about feelings and bitterness. Yes, those things were there, but not in the way I expected. I found it much more watchable than I thought it would be and that's credit to the filmmakers and the actors involved. It's quite a tricky subject to cover and I thought they did a pretty good job Recommended.My Score: 7.5/10",Brothers

Captured by the Taliban, he manages to live through a nightmare by committing a terrible act that undermines and eventually destroys his sanity. His return to the living is difficult on his wife and daughters and it only gets worse. Gyllenhaal is his brother, Portman his wife and Shepard the father of the two brothers.

60,Geeky Randy,Geeky Randy's summary,10,2 April 2010,"Based on the Danish film ""Brødre"" and inspired by Homer's ""The Odyssey"", about two tough brothers on opposite ends of the spectrum. One, an honorable marine. The other, an ex-con. As Tommy (Gyllenhaal) is released from prison, his older brother Sam (Mcguire) prepares for a tour in Afghanistan. After a helicopter crash, Sam is presumed dead, and Tommy tries to better himself by watching over his brother's wife and two girls. However, Sam survives, and after making a life-altering narrow escape from imprisonment, he is sent back home. But Sam suspects his brother of something more than just watching over his family. Wonderfully structured, similarly to ""The Deer Hunter"", and the relationships with all seven of the family members is flawlessly orchestrated. Mcguire especially demonstrates himself as an actor with many faces. Sad, but also inspiring.**** (out of four)",Brothers
61,Likes_Ninjas90,Compulsive viewing for anyone disappointed with The Hurt Locker,8,27 March 2010,"Tommy (Jake Gyllenhaal) and Sam (Tobey Maguire) are two very different but tightly knit brothers. Sam is a marine who has been touring in Afghanistan and is married to Sarah (Natalie Portman), with two children. Tommy is just being released from prison after serving for armed robbery. Sam's father Hank (Sam Shepard), who is a Vietnam War veteran, views him as a war hero and slams Tommy for not being more like his brother. However, Sarah and her two little girls are disappointed when Sam has to travel back into the zone, leaving them alone at home. Sam's redeployment into Afghanistan is immediately disrupted though when his helicopter is shot down and he and another soldier are taken prisoner by the Taliban. With Sam presumed dead, Sarah grieves at home but takes comfort in Tommy's help, despite their initial contempt for one another.Given the inferiority of so many Hollywood remakes, it is pleasing to announce that Jim Sheridan's film, a remake of the Danish picture Brødre, is a deeply emotional film with messages of the utmost importance. The trailer to Brothers is thoroughly misleading, suggesting that this will be a more formulaic romance about Tommy and Grace falling in love, believing that Sam is dead. However, their slight embrace is brief and overshadowed by the more complex issues of the film. Many have praised The Hurt Locker for being a psychological war film and a complex meditation on war as a drug. Where Bigelow's film faltered for a distinct lack of depth though, Brothers succeeds with similar but more insightful observations. There is more time here attributed to the home life, allowing Sheridan and his actors to explore the affects of war on not just the soldiers but the families as well. What Sam experiences in Afghanistan fuels his angst and as such a certain level of verisimilitude and conviction is required in these war scenes to justify his fears at home. Despite an initially disjointed separation between the two very different environments, Sam's capture remains brutal and confronting, raising powerful moral questions: Is your life worth more than someone else's? Early on, the film edges towards a sense of patriotism and overtly American values, with the discussion of Sam being a war hero and a former quarterback star. Most surprisingly, the film persists in revealing the falsity of patriotism and heroism through Sam's self-destruction and isolation, which is certainly the most challenging and emotional aspect of Brothers.The richness of the cast and the quality of the performances has drawn more attention to this film than the original picture. Although he will always be recognised as the heart of the Spiderman films, Tobey Maguire gives the very best performance of his career, consolidating himself as a serious dramatic actor. The contrast between his kindness and his fury that he shows to his children is unnerving, as too are his physical constraints, having lost twenty pounds to personify this character. The scarcity of his dialogue in the second half also ensures that he is completely self-contained and erupting internally. When he does explode late in the film, it is a frightful occurrence, leading to some of the film's most dramatic and emotional moments. There are quieter performances too though, with Natalie Portman bringing sincerity to her role as a mother. The look on her face when she sees the messengers at the door is a heartbreaking moment of raw emotion. Jake Gyllenhaal is also in fine touch as the slightly cheeky Tommy, a decent person but a foolish and irresponsible one all the same. Interestingly, a few of his conversations with one of Sam's daughters suggests that the same problems of favouritism which he suffered from will continue to trouble this family too.Brothers is certainly not easy viewing because this is an emotionally draining and intense anti-war film. However, it is the performances of the three leads which inspire the heart and the conscience of this film. War here is emotionally affecting, not just for the soldiers, but for the families that have to suffer in both in their presence and their absence alike. Though initially this might seem like a patriotic story, the gradual progression of the narrative in subverting ideas of patriotism makes this small but imperative film compulsive viewing for anyone disappointed with The Hurt Locker.",Brothers
62,Christian_Dimartino,Powerful.,9,30 May 2010,"Jake Gylenhaal and Tobey McGuire are brothers in Brothers, the most recent film from director Jim Sheridan(My left foot, In America). Brothers is his most interesting film yet. And his most underrated. This is a near perfect film. The performances from most every cast member are terrific. And it gives them an opportunity to do something like never before.Tobey McGuire plays Sam Cahill, a military man who goes missing and is presumed dead. So his wife Grace(played by the wonderful Natile Portman)is alone. And eventually, Sam's slacker brother Tommy(played by the wonderful Jake Gylenhaal) starts to help out around the house.At first they start at a rough start. Then they soon start to kind of fall for each other. And their kids start to treat Tommy like he is their father. All is well, until they find out that Sam is still alive.Tobey Mcguire is amazing in this movie. This is a Tobey Mcguire that i've never seen before. Natile Portman, well it goes without saying and so does Jake Gylenhaal. Brothers has a lot to love. Though it's not my favorite film of the year or doesn't make my top ten. But it comes close. Not only does it have terrific acting, it's very powerful. I loved this movie.Brothers:A",Brothers
63,MattyGibbs,Powerful and well acted drama,8,1 June 2013,"This is an interesting film which raises some interesting questions about war and how it affects people. This is a film that will get many different responses but one that should be explored a lot more than it is. The film follows one family whose one son who is has recently been released from jail (Jake Gyllenhaal)and another who is presumed dead fighting in Afghanistan (Tobey Maguire). When the no good brother gets close to the wife things get complicated when the presumed dead brother returns. This is an intelligent and well acted drama which throws up some interesting moral questions. I'm not a fan of Natalie Portman, in fact quite the opposite, but she does a really good job in this. Jake Gyllenhall and Tobey Maguire are excellent and convincing as the two brothers who are apparently poles apart but are actually more similar than you would think. Brothers is an emotion packed ride through the pain of loss and perceived loss. This is recommended to anyone who likes hard hitting drama.",Brothers
64,moviesleuth2,Has its moments,6,3 July 2010,"Despite having some moments of real power and a pair of stirring performances, I can't recommend Jim Sheridan's remake of ""Brothers."" It's one of those films that goes through the motions, but neglects to try to capture the essence of the story and its characters.Sam Cahill (Tobey Maguire) is a captain of the US Marine Corps. He has a loving wife, Grace (Natalie Portman) and two daughters. Sadly, Sam is killed in Afghanistan, and Tommy (Jake Gyllenhaal), Sam's wayward brother who was just released from prison, grows attached to Grace and her daughters. But Sam is not dead, and when he arrives home, the tension in the household quickly nears its breaking point.The problem with the story is that it plays safe. There is almost no character development and a clunky storyline. What were the producers thinking? They had two Oscar nominees in their cast, and the headlining star of one of the biggest franchises in film history! It's as if they still didn't trust in their actors' abilities to create real characters (Granted, playing the web-slinger shouldn't stretch anyone's range, but money is always a bigger player than talent in the film industry).Of the three central performances, only Tobey Maguire is surprising. He is very good. He has been in the movies for a while, but this is the first time I've actually seen him play someone other than a geek (well, play a non-geek well, because he was sorely miscast in ""The Good German""). Maguire is quite good at playing the aloof Sam who is undoubtedly suffering from Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder. He doesn't give the best performance in the film, however. That title goes to Jake Gyllenhaal, who seems to be able to do anything. Natalie Portman is the lone weak link. It's sad; the once promising starlet's performances have taken a turn for the worse in recent years (although she's eons better than she was in ""Goya's Ghosts,"" a film she might want to consider leaving off her resume).I saw Jim Sheridan's earlier film, ""In America,"" which was well made, but it was too afraid to show any real struggle, which made the conflict inert. With ""Brothers,"" he is more open to showing real drama. Unfortunately, his approach is stale and mechanical. I'm guessing this would have been a much better film had it not been edited to its very bones. Much of the story seems to be missing.There are some good things about ""Brothers,"" but the film is too flawed to give it a true recommendation.",Brothers

One can sympathize with all of the characters in the movie. The young actress you plays Tobey McGuire's distraught daughter gives one of the movie's best performances. Tobey, Natalie and Jake are all extremely good also. Sam Shepard's role could have been expanded but he does the best with the little that he is given to do. But poor Mare Cunningham is given almost nothing at all to do as the long suffering wife and mother. it takes at least two viewings to get the full emotional effect.

67,ClaytonDavis,We all knew Tobey had it in him...,6,24 November 2009,"Jim Sheridan has been nearly consistent in his career. Ripping through the screen in 1989 with the Academy Award Nominated, My Left Foot, where Sheridan proved he was a force to be reckoned with. He's also hit some other great accolades along the way with The Field, In the Name of the Father, and In America, his most personal portrait of his career. The subject of the war in Iraq and Afghanistan has been fresh on filmmaker's minds as of late. Most films have focused on the war itself, and what the toll of bloodshed can have on our soldiers in combat. What Sheridan's newest film Brothers attempts to share with its audience is the psychological pain of a soldier thrust back into home life and toll it takes on the family.Brothers tells the story of Sam (Tobey Maguire), a Captain for the Marines who goes on a tour in Afghanistan and is captured by Al-Qaeda along with a fellow soldier and is tortured and hounded for intelligence. Presumed dead, his wife Grace (Natalie Portman) is mourning his loss while trying to raise his two daughters. His brother Tommy (Jake Gyllenhaal) has just been released from jail and trying to adjust to life outside prison and facing constant ridicule from his alcoholic father (Sam Shepard). When Sam is pronounced dead, Tommy's paternal instinct kicks in and plays the family role in helping Grace take care of the girls. As months pass, Grace and Tommy's once rocky relationship goes a different route. But all changes when Sam is rescued and brought back home.Writer David Benioff adapts the film well but misses the mark with cheesy dialogue and not enough bridges between characters. Sheridan fills the film with tension and silence which make Thomas Newman's score nearly non-existent. The film doesn't make anything new with its cinematography or film pacing. Sheridan seems half-fast in his execution and doesn't measure up to his previous works.The performances are hit and miss in terms of the casts deliveries but overall make for a passable ensemble performance. Natalie Portman, the Oscar nominated actress of Closer, takes on her most mature role of her career. Playing a mother of two with Portman's age 28 is a stretch when looking at the petite and youthful actress. Portman takes on her transformation with poise and charisma. Jake Gyllenhaal, our young ""Jack Twist"" from his Oscar nominated Brokeback Mountain, has been a talent to watch for years now. As ""Tommy,"" Gyllenhaal brings a hard yet tender performance not seen before by him. He doesn't command ""Tommy"" like I had hoped, but Gyllenhaal is an outstanding talent with much promise to win his own Oscar someday. Veteran actor Sam Shepard, who was once nominated by the Academy for The Right Stuff, does an impeccable job as Hank, an ex-marine with a drinking problem, who makes evident preferences of children. It's great to see an actor of Shepard's caliber still giving great work. Mare Winningham, Patrick Flueger, Taylor Geare, and especially Bailee Madison, all contribute beautifully to an outstanding cast.In the end, it's Tobey Maguire who gives his best performance to date. As ""Capt. Sam Kahill,"" Maguire has finally showed up his once promising acting chops in his earlier part of his career. Maguire's ""Sam"" is once a devoted father and husband with much love for his younger brother ""Tommy."" After his painful capture and lucky return to civilization, there is something different about Sam. His entire post-traumatic war syndrome is manifested in his constant concern of whether or not his brother and his wife slept together during his absence. Maguire is wrapped in Sam like a quilted blanket, desperately trying to release the anguish of his pain. Maguire's approach to the character is different then initially interpreted. He brings it to a whole new level, something excruciating and dying to be set free from.It's Maguire's performance that stands out as the only worthy part of the film in need of citation. He would have faired better however, in the supporting category. The three main characters are all co-leads which make it tricky to campaign them but if he's Lead then all of them should be and vice-versa. Brothers doesn't measure up to some of the Iraqi-war films we've seen succeed as of late.**½/****",Brothers
68,moviemanMA,Family comes first,7,5 January 2010,"The war in Iraq and Afghanistan has made its mark on cinema in the past few years. Critics across the board have praised The Hurt Locker as one of the best films of the year, a film about a bomb squad whose new bomb technician lives life on the edge. It's an amazing film and certainly deserves all of the praise and accolades. When it comes to the war genre my favorite films tend to be the ones that don't focus on the fighting and actual war, but what happens on the side and back home. This is where we look in Jim Sheridan's Brothers, an adaptation of Danish filmmaker Susanne Bier's 2004 film of the same name.Captain Sam Cahill (Tobey Maguire) is being shipped back to Afghanistan. A few days before he goes his brother Tommy (Jake Gyllenhaal) is released from prison. Sam and his wife Grace (Natalie Portman) have two little girls, both of whom don't want there father to go and neither really know who their uncle Tommy is. Sam and Tommy's father (Sam Shepard), a former soldier himself, is proud of Sam, but is disappointed in Tommy and makes him very aware of how Sam is the role model son. Even though the rest of the family believes Tommy to be the screwup, Sam is kind to him. After all, they are brothers.Things settle down and Sam goes back into the mountains of Afghanistan. On what appears to be a routine excursion, Sam's helicopter is hit with an RPG, sending him and his men to the river below. Word gets back home that he was shot down and presumed dead. Grace, devastated, tries to keep her composure for her family's sake. Tommy, realizing that Sam's family has been ripped apart, tries to prove his father wrong by making a difference. He helps Grace with the kids and keeping house.Tommy proves himself in his father's eyes as well as in Grace's. The sparks soon fly between Tommy and Grace, though they know it is wrong. Things change when word gets back that Sam is alive. He comes home a changed man. The Sam Cahill they all knew before has left and the remains of a war-battered soldier is all that remains.Sheridan makes us aware that Sam is alive, going back and forth between the family and Sam in Afghanistan. We see the transformation both the family and in Sam, as the two become acclimated to their new situations. Sam and his fellow soldier are held captive and endure hardships while Tommy and Grace thrive in their new found friendship. We know that the inevitable will happen when Sam comes home and Tommy must resume his role as the brother instead of the substitute father and husband. It's like watching two trains from a distance as they careen towards each other head on.The driving force of the film is Maguire's performance. He reminds us that he is more than just the man in the Spider-Man suit. We see him both physically and mentally crumble as the film progresses. He has a terrifying stare like he can see right through you and he doesn't like what he sees. His mind has been twisted around so drastically that what was once his home has now become a strange environment. Without his performance the movie doesn't stat afloat.This is not meant to discredit Portman, Gyllenhaal, and Shepard. Shepard in particular does a nice job in portraying the father. The girls in the film too fill their roles nicely. They don't seem to be acting too much but are not completely oblivious as to what they are supposed to do. I guess Maguire's performance merely overshadows the rest.Sheridan does a fine job escalating and increasing the action of the film. He knows that the main focus of the film is not the war or even the brothers, but the family. He wants to show us what happens to everyone involved in the story. We care about what happens in Afghanistan, but it's not the main purpose. We care about Sam, Tommy, Grace, the kids, and everyone else in the Cahill clan.There is another film that is sort of similar to this one called Things We Lost in the Fire from 2007. I had originally intended on talking about the similarities but instead I was completely caught off guard by who directed it. Sheridan? Nope. Susanne Bier. Similar stories in that the father is taken away from the family in each one and another man comes in to try and put the pieces back together. It's a pretty solid film, again saved by the performances, this time by Halle Berry and Benicio Del Toro.All in all Brothers is a decent film with a great characters. One drawback is that the film explores too many emotions. I feel as if there is so much going on and it changes so quickly that I don't have enough time to deal with each emotion. Still, a good film thanks especially to Maguire.",Brothers

70,dansview,Terribly Miscast but Stylish,7,9 January 2015,"Sorry, but I'm not buying Tobey McGuire as an ex high school football star or a current Marine leader. He just doesn't look like the type. Having said that, he did a great job of portraying a man in shock.Even more so, I'm not buying a 90 pound Israeli American girl who looks like a teenager, as a late 20's New Mexico mom and ex-cheerleader. Having said that, Natalie Portman did a terrific job of showing patience and sensitivity to the travails of the men in her life.Jake G. has such an expressive and sensitive face, that you just have to love him. I did buy him in his role. Not because he's lovable, but because he looked like a guy with a dark side and redeeming qualities.I am quite sensitive to Liberal Hollywood portrayals of the military. But I don't think this was really an anti-military or anti-war movie. The dad came back from Vietnam messed up, but he was still a proud Marine. The son in the Marines was depicted as an honorable winner.There is a scene around a birthday table that built tension gradually. It was the best scene in a film that had several other scenes with tension-builders.This is a downer picture. But if you're the type who appreciates good dialog and acting, and doesn't need a fancy setting or lots of action, then you should appreciate this one for what it is. Nice use of mood music as well.",Brothers
71,Mike_Devine,There have been better wartime dramas,5,28 January 2018,"2009's wartime family drama 'Brothers' was almost manufactured to be an Oscar contender. From its A-list cast to the raw, gritty themes it explores, the Jim Sheridan-directed film had all the elements that could earn it lots of accolades. Except, perhaps, an original, compelling story.What we have here is a film that focuses on the strengths of its actors rather than pulling together a cohesive final product. We see Tobey Maguire's Marine Captain Sam Cahill in and out of combat, putting a strain on his wife, Grace (Natalie Portman) and daughters. We see Sam's troubled brother, Tommy (Jake Gyllenhaal) deal with alcoholism and unemployment. We see the tension that ensues when Sam returns home from Afghanistan after being feared dead - and the relationship between his wife and brother seems to have grown in his absence.Again, it's really all about the acting in 'Brothers.' Maguire does an admirable job of showing what the horrors of war can do to people, and his performance shines a light on the problem that PTSD is for many. Gyllenhaal plays a convincing deadbeat who is irresponsible and down on his luck. And Portman gives what is perhaps the best performance of her career up to that point. But all of these seem to be done in silos, and despite the way the script is written - where all three characters are intertwined - there is a total lack of chemistry.Sure, there are plenty of scenes that are powerful or really hit home. But they all happen in silos. They don't weave together seamlessly like they should. Yes, the climax is a gripping few minutes. But one scene a movie does not make.'Brothers' is hard-hitting, dark and messy. It's a tour de force of acting. But overall, it's a mediocre movie at best.",Brothers
72,nickmesafilms,Brothers (2009) - Maguire + Gyllenhaal = Brothers!,7,3 May 2012,"Directed by Jim Sheridan, this adaptation of ""Brodre"", a Danish film from 2004, is a gripping, and heart-wrenching tale of brotherhood, forgiveness, and soul. But to make this review make more sense, it seems suitable to be issuing a spoiler alert! After becoming a household name in the Spider-Man movies, Tobey Maguire delivers the most powerful performance of his career, as Sam, he's married to Natalie Portman, and they have two beautiful little girls. But, once he's ordered to go out to war in Afghanistan, his family finds out he has been killed in battle. His brother, Tommy, portrayed by Jake Gyllenhaal, then stands in, and tries to help fix his brother's family. He starts getting along with the girls, he builds a new kitchen in their house, and he tries to help out with the wife. But for all we know, maybe a romance is starting to begin. But after some unexpected news, they kind out that Sam isn't really dead, and now he's going to come back home. Now, Sam is starting to have a feeling that maybe his brother might have had some romance with his wife. This is one of the perfect love-triangle stories, ever used in a movie! ""Brothers"" is not necessarily a tribute to those we lost in Afghanistan, but rather a captured look at the dynamics of a family father, struggling to wonder if his brother was trying to fall in love with his wife, after struggling to get back home. Jake Gyllenhaal and Natalie Portman all do fine work in their roles, but Tobey Maguire delivers the best performance in the movie, and it should have been worthy of a Best Actor nomination. This movie is filled with dramatic and heart-stopping moments that will put you on the edge with suspense. But, there's something missing from this movie. I was only impressed mostly by the acting. The directing is pretty well-accomplished, and the writing is superb, but I focused more on the acting. I just wished that the movie had more. Besides, there were some moments in the film where I was kind of bored, and there were a few uninteresting scenes. Those scenes weren't bad, but I just felt a little lost. I respect that the movie was really well-made, but the movie feels more like a family drama, instead of a suspenseful drama, where the whole ""love-triangle"" situation is put in the last half of the movie! So, while putting together the pros and cons, ""Brothers"" is an interesting, heartbreaking, and powerful ""tour De force"" motion picture, but there were some times that the movie fell into some unexpected plot holes. ""Brothers"", in my review, ""a heart-wrenching drama, but sometimes unremarkable"".",Brothers
73,barrys82,An very intense drama,6,15 August 2010,"Brothers is a movie that tells the story of a young man comforts his older brother's wife and children after he goes missing in Afghanistan. It is a very intense drama full of conflicts. The plot is very well developed and the story is very interesting because it reflects a problem that could happen in real life to real people. The rhythm is a little slow and sometimes you feel that the movie isn't progressing specially at the moments of war. The cast is excellent, Tobey Maguire gives us a little overacted but also very credible performance first as a loving husband and father ready to go to war and then as a mentally disturbed soldier. Jake Gyllenhaal in the role of Tobey's brother is also very good changing from a irresponsible person to the man of the house taking care of his brother's wife ands children, Natalie Portman is a great actress, his performance is so convincing you can really feel her sorrow and a special mention to the two girls that performed as Maguire and Portman girls the two of them give a believable performance specially the bigger one. In conclusion, Brothers is a recommendable option, just one thing, go watch this movie relax because the tension it has will trap you.",Brothers
74,yris2002,"Very moving drama on family bonds and war, very well acted and deeply felt",8,27 December 2009,"American cinematography seems to be in strong need of movies exorcising the horror of war (I think of ""In the valley of Elah""), through the depiction of family stories, showing how war may affect deeply and often destroy the lives of soldiers and their families.There's still much American pride in that flag waving from the first scene, and much sense of honour in laying down one's life for the sake of the country. However, the damage brought about by war on the emotional and psychological life of this family, puts everything into question, and in the end, controversial thoughts and feelings are aroused, mainly when we perceive that the edge between good and evil is so narrow and difficult to establish. The cast is outstanding, and their contained, never excessive interpretations prevents the movie from verging on the too melodramatic. Natalie Portman handles her difficult character very carefully and convincingly, Toby Macguire, does a great work, mainly considering his background of lighter roles, Jake Gyllenhaal is good, but less convincing, being his development too quick. Also the always impeccable Tom Shepard could have given more if his character would have been given more space. The little girl playing Isabelle is surprisingly noteworthy. It is a very tear-jerking movie, although every emotion is filtered in a delicate way. In the end I get comforted by the idea that family bonds, no matter how fragile and difficult, are the only certain, real thing from which to start in order to try to find a sense, where a sense seems to be lost forever. A really worth seeing-movie.",Brothers
75,raisleygordon,I would have preferred a more heavy-handed approach,5,2 April 2010,"The movie does deliver the goods, but I found the film's tone to be uneven, veering from heavy-handed to low-key, and the subplot about the kitchen makeover to be somewhat unnecessary. This may have been a welcome home gift, but it's just an excuse for Tobey Maguire to wreck the place out of anger. I thought the darker tones of the movie were more interesting (and convincing) than the lighter ones. If the movie had been a lot more realistic, and a lot more darker, then I probably would have enjoyed it more. Half the time, I couldn't understand what was going on in the scenes taking place in Afghanistan. Or maybe I don't know much about war. Also, if Tommy Cahill had died in Afghanistan, instead of just giving his family the impression that he had died, then we might have had something.**1/2 out of ****",Brothers
76,srdjan_veljkovic,"Had a lot going for it, but didn't deliver to the end",6,30 January 2016,"Casting is very good. The brothers are good. Natalie Portman proves she can act, you really see her as a sub-urban housewife of a low ranking military officer. She also looks prettier than usual, maybe because she looks more normal than usual. Grandpa is also good and the girls are very, very cute. You can see how those cuties easily removed the chip from their uncle's shoulder.The story is fine, there is a touch of propaganda because the production was from one of the countries in the conflict that the movie is about. But, it's not too much. Yes, there are much better stories of similar nature (i.e. Deer Hunter), but this one is good enough.Direction and the technical aspect are also fine, nothing exceptional, yet a job well done.But, by the end, it just doesn't follow through. It goes to too short (or too long) sequences, without enough time for the viewer to get into the emotions (or with enough time to get a little bored). Actually, the actors have a symmetrical problem - they have to put too much in too little time, and it feels forced. It's hard to say why that happened, the movie wasn't too long, so a 5-10 minutes more wouldn't be that big of a problem.",Brothers
77,tburke85,Brothers An Effective Drama With Exceptional Performances,8,9 May 2010,"Brothers is an effective drama with exceptional performances by Tobey Maguire, Jake Gyllenhaal, and Natalie Portman as the three leads. Director Jim Sheridan is admirable in making this movie that does have some flaws which I'll get into later but the good more than outweighs the bad. Tobey Maguire gives one of his best performances showing audiences his range as an actor outside of being Peter Parker in the Spider-man movies by Sam Raimi. The first two were good but the third one not so much at least to me. Anyways Maguire does a convincing job as Captain Sam Cahill whose suffering from post traumatic stress when he returns home after being held captive behind enemy lines. Maguire brings a quiet intensity to Sam that definitely comes through in the third act. Well done. Jake Gyllenhaal is equally impressive as Sam's charismatic younger brother Tommy whose had a troubled past. Gyllenhaal starts off by playing Tommy as kind of a drunk jerk but when Sam is presumed dead he rises up and seeks redemption for past mistakes by stepping into the void his brother has left. He becomes a surrogate father for his brother's two girls when they needed one the most and an unlikely shoulder to cry on for Sam's wife Grace. Gyllenhaal doesn't share too many scenes with Maguire but they make the best of the ones they do have together. They played off each other well so the chemistry was there making them believable as brothers. Natalie Portman is effective as Sam's wife Grace. She's shows a range of emotions here after learning Sam might be dead which certainly comes through in her performance. Portman continues to show her talent as an actress and this film is no different. She had nice chemistry with Maguire which made their relationship seem real on screen. If it weren't for Gyllenhaal, Portman, and Maguire I probably wouldn't have enjoyed it as much as did because their performances made it worth watching alone. The rest of the cast are very good as well in their limited screen time including Sam Shepard, Clifton Collins Jr., Marie Winningham, and the two girls who played Sam's daughters. The pacing of the movie was a little slow at times before it started to pick up before the climax which kind of weighed it down a bit. Some of the characters are really developed either because most of the focus is on the three leads (Maguire, Gyllenhaal, and Portman) but the rest of the film made up for it's few flaws especially the performances by the cast. Overall Brothers is a well made drama the deals with themes like guilt, forgiveness, and the importance of family. So if this sounds like a movie that peaks your interest than chances are you'll enjoy Brothers which was much better than expected. Maybe not the all time best movie I've seen but it was an entertaining film none the less. Brothers is an emotional drama with some suspense, a little humor, and impressive performances by the cast (Portman, Gyllehaal, and especially Maguire) who make this one worth the time to watch.",Brothers
78,spasek,No One Knows,7,19 March 2021,"Unless you have served in a war, you can never know what these men and women go through. It is impossible. No one else knows the scars and turmoil that always seem to linger just below the surface. No one else knows the memories that haunt those who've survived like shadows that are always present.Yes, only the dead have seen the end of war because their suffering is over. For many of those who've survived, the war never seems to end. It is always there.It doesn't matter how close you are as a family member or a friend. Unless you've had the experience yourself, you will always be an outsider unable to cross over into the realm of shared experiences.I recall the ""Band of Brothers"" documentary, which is aptly titled, ""We Stand Alone Together."" The family members of these veterans, these heroes, know that they can only ever stand on the outside of the circle and understand why the annual reunions are so important for these men. It gives them the opportunity to share and to be together with those who have been there.The best movie I've ever seen about returning war veterans is still ""The Best Years of Our Lives"" which rightfully took home the 1946 Best Picture only a year after World War II ended. Most people even then couldn't comprehend what those men went through.""Brothers"" does a credible job, if not a great one. My only wish was that it had gone deeper; that it had spent more time on Sam Cahill's struggles to readjust. Personally, I would have shown his captivity as a back-story in a series of flashbacks, while spending more time on him in the present. Cahill is, by far, the most compelling character of the film, and yet he's not given nearly enough time.The performances are all first-rate across the board, and I think Tobey Maguire may have turned in his finest. However, I was enormously impressed by the acting skills of young Bailee Madison. For a young actress to be able to tap into those feelings and emotions at such an age, is nothing short of pure genius. The best actors and actresses are able to act with their eyes and feelings without using words. Madison has already mastered that craft.""Brothers"" isn't necessarily an easy film to watch, but it is relevant and necessary. My least favorite scene, which only serves to prove my point, is Grace using threats to compel her husband to reveal his secret. Only someone who is ignorant of war would ever use such a tactic. Sometimes, people forget that the often the best thing you can is to just simply be there. You don't have to understand, because you never will unless you've been through it yourself. But being a space for someone, and allowing them to share--if they so choose to--is the best gift you can give.",Brothers

And I kind of laughed when I saw him being in a military role or something. I liked the plot of the film until in the end when it felt to be collapsing. The film has a little war time things and is basically a family drama. How people cope up in adverse situations, father son relationship and most importantly the relationship between the brothers. To be frank I did not find a lot of emphasis on the relationship between the brothers. And the title itself is Brothers. Natalie Portman is one of the best actress available and she does a fine job in each of her films. The direction seems to be tight. The plot should have included more intimacy in dialogs and emotions. Also the acting by the bigger girl was amazing.

Great acting indeed by the three main actors and yes it should get Oscar nominated for something but as emotional and powerful as this film is, I don't feel it carries enough weight to be a blockbuster. The brotherly love lacks substance and solidity and there are only a couple of scenes in the whole film when we see the two brothers together. The film clearly explores a womans love for her husband and her 'interest' in his wayward brother. I did think it need not be a war film at all but about one brother who disappears and then re-appears as a different person while his less bright brother took to take advantage of the situation. Afghanistan gave the story a platform but not more.",Brothers
82,Ric-7,Too short,9,21 February 2011,"I didn't see the Danish film, but I don't think this film is about the armed forces or the war in Afghanistan, any more than it is about prison. The title tells you what it is about: brothers. How one was deemed a failure and the other an example of the best. And how their lives were not so black-and-white. The contrasts were amazing: the ""loser"" taking steps to redeem himself from a criminal event that he evidently chose and created. His victim apparently suffered post-traumatic stress disorder as a result, and possibly his apology would help his victim recover. In contrast, we are left to wonder whether the ""hero"" will be able to save himself from a horrible event that was forced on him, and whether confiding in anyone would be of any help.I think it is a token of the terrific acting in this film that I wanted to follow these people past the ending of the film. It seemed to me that this was a trilogy, and we had only seen to about mid-way into the second film. The paranoia which besets the hero is not necessarily a product only of some isolated war situations. Much more frequently such mental illness arises from other causes, and I think an interesting film might be made on how the family deals with the situation, the potential causes, and the possible solutions.The film did not need to answer all questions. It would be impossible to do so in the running time of a single film. I really enjoyed the film. But anyone who thinks this film is intended as an indictment of war is missing the point.",Brothers

85,blacklist-1,"A touching story of love, family and the effects of war",7,8 April 2010,"Brothers is highly watchable movie about the effects war can have on the soldier and his family. This film is designed to involve it's audience on an emotional and to an extent an intellectual level and it does succeed mostly. The basic story is that Toby Maguire plays solider Sam Cahill who is sent to war in Afghanistan leaving behind his wife Grace (Natalie Portman) and his two beautiful children. Eventually though he is pronounced dead and Grace has to pick up the pieces and move on. Meanwhile Sam's brother Tommy (Jake Gyllenhaal) who has been in prison helps out Grace and gets close to her and eventually they end up falling for each other. But eventually Sam comes back from the war as it turns out he was a POW. The change from when he left is very different and soon you find out why as he detaches himself from his family and accused his brother of sleeping with Grace. Meanwhile Tommy has a fractured relationship with his father Hank (Sam Shephard) The acting is superb particularly Maguire. I was worried that he would look too innocent and awkward from playing Peter Parker in the Spiderman trilogy to convey any anguish with the effect the war had on him but he transitions himself brilliantly. When you see the change come over him, it is very believable and shocking to see. Natalie Portman does well as the supposed widow and I found Jake Gyllenhaal (who proved his acting ability in The Day After Tomorrow) and Sam Sherpard acting to be good too. The relationships are explored between the dad and sons well, where Hank Cahill clearly favours one over the other. But I wish the first hour could have been more emotional. I didn't feel the real powerful tone of Grace supposedly losing Sam. It's only within the last forty five minutes did the tone of anguish and love with the relationships within the family felt sincere and in more depth. It would have been nice to see more exploration of the brothers relationship to each other in relation to there father. Why did Tommy turn to crime etc? Was it because he father favoured Sam more? We can only guess. We don't actually know. And I wished there had been more chemistry between Portman and Gyllenhaal. It wasn't bad but it could have been better as I didn't really believe that really loved each other. Despite it's flaws this is still touching and there is good exploration between war, family and love and the acting is competent enough with Maguire being the best. It's worth seeing this film and I did find it interesting and engaging to watch as lots of soldiers in wars like Afghanistan, Iraq and the world wars were haunted by what they saw and did just to keep alive. This film reminds us that war can be extremely distressing not just for the solider but the family as well, which is too often overlooked.",Brothers

Unfortunately for me, it never got going and some of that has to be attributed to casting. Tobey Maguire still looks like a 14 year old weakling so I couldn't see him as this veteran marine captain. Similarly, Jake Gylenhall is too much of a nice guy to play a convicted felon, maybe he wasn't meant to ""threaten"" here but was too nice in the role for me.A movie like this is all about empathy but there wasn't enough character development or plot scenarios to get me that interested in the characters, it was only in the last 35 minutes that Sam started to lose the plot but the high drama I was expecting just didn't materialize and in the end I was pleased the film ended when it did and it didn't meander on some more.

93,rawiri42,Disappointing.,6,23 April 2013,"I am not really a fan of war themed movies and especially the American ""hero"" farce where America is always portrayed as the saviour of the world as opposed to what it really is, the instigator of wars. I realise that there will be numerous readers who will take exception to that statement because they have been successfully brainwashed into believing otherwise. But the fact is that American citizens pay taxes to ensure that their country is the most powerful military force on earth. But what does that mean? It means that little impoverished countries either march to America's tune or pay dearly for not doing so.OK, what has this to do with Brothers, the movie? Well, no one who hasn't experienced being cannon fodder for what their government's propaganda convinces them to sincerely believe to be ""right"" can possibly have any idea what those brave (but, to their government, dispensable) human boys go through at the hands of desperate people clutching at straws of violence and terrorism to attempt to exert their independence can possibly even attempt to know what that can do to a person psychologically - and everyone is different.However, the behaviour of what are supposed to be ""normal"" people with whom those soldiers come into contact is a totally different thing. For example, when Sam (Tobey Maguire) quite understandably asks his wife, Grace (Natalie Portman) if she has been ""f**king his brother"", why on earth did she take so long to emphatically assure him that she had not? He told her that he would understand if she had and all she needed to say was that, whilst she had sorely needed to be loved when she believed he was dead, she simply couldn't do it and so it had not happened. That way, Sam's fears would not have been ridiculed but they would have, in a few words, have been dispelled. There were several other examples of similar instances where the rationally thinking members of the family could have easily relieved tension by simply saying something sensible but they didn't. Whilst people do, of course, sometimes fail to say the right words, it shouldn't happen as often as it does in this movie. All of this added up to make the film much sadder that it need have been. Where was the psychiatric counselling that Sam and Grace (and the family) so obviously needed? Whilst it may have been provided, we weren't shown any of it. The way that a severely traumatised soldier was just dumped on his family's doorstep tended to make me even more angry at what I have already referred to as the way American politicians see their men a cannon fodder. Oh yes, when they return home from tours of duty or come back in a coffin draped with the stars and stripes, lots of ceremony accompanies them but it's all for show and it disgusts me because they shouldn't have been sent to fight in the first place. As the Afghani told Sam, ""This is OUR country and you shouldn't be here!""I can honestly say that I have absolutely no idea what I would have done if faced with the choice of either making a comrade's wife a widow or my own wife a widow and, as I have said, I don't believe anyone else who hasn't actually experienced such a horror, could know either. However, had Sam not taken the action he did, the most likely result would have been both wives becoming instant widows. Perhaps the best solution to all of this would be for America to send the multitudes of serial killers they seem to have to war. They would flinch at whatever needed to be done and it would be a multiple tax-saving - less jail expenses, less widows' pensions and, of course, less military pay packets!Finally, I felt that the film was very prematurely ended.

Somehow I felt that some part of movie was playing off screen. I could see the change in characters but didn't felt I had seen enough to warrant that change, especially in the kids.

96,Willie-12,"Great Acting, Good Story...But Felt A Bit Unsatisfying",7,13 December 2009,"I finally figured it out. I finally realize why I felt a bit unsatisfied after the conclusion of Brothers. I should first say that all that has been said about the acting is spot on. It is a tremendous display of acting ability from all involved. I will not be surprised if nominations fall on all three of the leads. And the story seemed solid. Indeed, up until the end, I was completely engrossed in what was going on. Jim Sheridan had crafted what seemed to me to be an almost flawless movie. It was beautifully filmed, and very well written. The characters were strong, and I came to care for each one of them. It really isn't even about how the film ended that bothered me. I don't know how it could have ended any other way. Tobey Maguire's character had obviously become very affected in a deeply disturbing way by the events that occurred while he was in captivity. It was quite apparent that he was going to have to spend a substantial amount of time in a psychiatric hospital. So I was not disappointed in the way the film ended, but in what we, as the audience, already knew when the film reached it's concluding scene. When Maguire's character finally confesses to his wife what happened, there should have been a much more powerful emotional punch. The audience should have felt as if they had the breath knocked out of them. But we didn't. At least I didn't, and from the lack of any real reaction from those around me, I would venture to guess that no one else felt that way either. Again, it had to do with what we already knew. Had what happened in Afghanistan stayed a mystery to not only Natalie Portman's character, but to the audience as well, the conclusion to Brothers would have possibly been one of the most powerful endings to a film that I've seen in some time. But it wasn't a mystery. We already knew. And that is the reason I was left a bit unsatisfied at the end of this otherwise well made film.",Brothers
97,toll-8,Starts poorly finishes terrifyingly.,5,7 November 2012,"Brothers is a film that explores what it is like for a soldier who returns home from war and how his life now seems more alien than what it did when he was out fighting. Once he returns a hero people think his work is done, but with some of these men the psychological trauma is too much to take and the mundane tasks of the real world are tougher to be a part of than shooting at the enemy. This film looks at this condition through the eyes of one family who grew stronger after hearing of his death but fell apart on his return to life.Brothers stars Tobey Maguire as Captain Sam Cahill. He is married to the gorgeous Grace (Natalie Portman) and has two young daughters. At the start he is the only one willing to pick his brother Tommy (Jake Gyllenhaal) up from prison as the rest of his family have disowned him since he was put inside. Sam is a good husband, father, brother, and from his proud Father's (Sam Shepard) perspective; son. Sam is sent back out to Afghanistan, much to the dismay of Grace, and is shot down in a helicopter whilst crossing the desert. Believed to be dead Sam's family are given terrible news and after much grieving do all they can to get back on with their lives. Grace is supported by Tommy who after his brother's death grows into a better person and does all he can to make Grace's life easier. Grace and Tommy's bond strengthens and one night they kiss. Both stop before it goes any further but they both know a line has been crossed. Meanwhile out in the desert Sam is still alive and has been imprisoned by the Afghan troops. After being tortured and flirting with death Sam is found and sent back home to his family. Once there it is apparent he is not the same person. He confronts Grace believing she is sleeping with Tommy and something inside is eating away at him causing violent tempers and rages. With the entire family becoming frightened of him Grace tries to get to the bottom of who this returned man really is and what actually happened when he was a prisoner of war.The film could have and should have been a lot better than it was. The synopsis for it reads well and the stars of the piece are audience grabbers, however it is other moments of the film that bring it down. For starters the script is terrible. The dialogue is some of the most unrealistic I have heard in a movie. I lost count of the amount of times Tommy and Sam told each other they were brothers. It was like the writer thought that we wouldn't understand the theme of the movie or that the title of the film related to these two men. Relating to the title I felt that the brother's relationship was the one that was the least explored. It showed each brother's relationship with the family but not really with each other, which I thought would have been the key element of the movie. However it was an interesting role reversal by the end where the one in the army became the lunatic and the one from prison became the most free. This arc for both worked really well especially through their father who I hated at the beginning and was glad that Tommy won his approval by the end. If the script for this film was tighter than it could have been much better.The acting is a major point to talk about. When I first saw Maguire was starring as the lead I though instantly that he was miscast. After seeing the film I don't disagree with my original thinking. Maguire is very good in this film. Not so much at first but by the end he has transformed into a different person and in the last scene he is brilliant, however he just does not look like a man in the army. He is a tiny scrawny man but we had to believe he was the leader of a troop out in Afghanistan. I failed to believe that he was a patriotic war hero because he never looked like one, I kind of felt that Gyllenhaal and Maguire should have swapped roles. That way I could believe Gyllenhaal was in the army and Maguire was the scrawny thief from prison. This was a major issue for me as, no matter how good he turned out to be, Maguire just didn't look the part. He even looked out of place to be married to the gorgeous Grace. Portman isn't on show stopping form here but she looks beautiful and brings a heart to the story. Gyllenhaal does his job but his character doesn't have much about him.By the end I was unsure what to think of the film. At the beginning the choice of music, the acting, and dialogue really put me off watching the rest. It looked like it was going to be a poor movie, proving why it had a limited release in cinemas. However when Sam came back the whole story changed and it became more gripping and tense. The final third of the movie ultimately saved it. The middle act tended to drag and felt like some of it could be trimmed but much of that is forgotten when you see Maguire's terrifying performance in the final act. The whole movie shows a good arc when it comes to characters and as a film. What starts off as a little dull and drab turns out to be frightening and dark. If it wasn't for the opening half this could have been much better.2.5 / 5For ore reviews: www.tolli-movieworld.blogspot.com",Brothers
98,manicman84,tackles the effects of war on the life of one family as well as the issue of forgiveness,8,21 March 2010,"I must admit that I haven't seen the Danish original directed by Susanne Bier. Given her reputation as an excellent drama filmmaker (After The Wedding, Open Hearts) and reportedly more immediate tone of her picture, I should have seen it. American version of Brothers is a really powerful drama that tackles the effects of war on the life of one family as well as the issue of forgiveness in a very peculiar circumstances. Jim Sheridan's movie is observational making the most of its subject matter. The dramatic situations in the movie are entirely credible as opposed to artificial. The movie benefits from excellent acting talents involved. In particular, Tobey Maguire provides a tour-de-force performance as a soldier mentally destroyed by the tragic events that took place during his stay in Afghanistan. Overall, Brothers is a meaningful take on the absurdity of war and its irreversible effect on the individual's psyche. It's a worthy companion piece to Kathryn Bigelow's The Hurt Locker. 8/10 (B+)",Brothers
99,robertmaybeth,The original Danish film is far superior - watch that instead of this one...,6,19 February 2017,"I really don't want to come across as some kind of film snob and that's not what this is about...it's about the original movie being better then the remake. I happened to see the 2009 Danish film by the same name before they came out with this one. But obviously Benioff simply bought the rights to the (excellent) story and made an all-American production. Unfortunately any trace of the original's expert story telling is completely gone from this throw-away movie. Not even Natalie Portman can raise this movie above the mediocre level it is, because it just doesn't work. The acting is mawkish and the story plays out completely unconvincing, having seen the well-made original it all seems like a tedious waste of time. If you've never seen either one but the storyline interests you, please watch the Danish film first (or instead of), the acting, direction, pacing and even the (subtitled) dialogue completely outclasses this mundane remake.",Brothers

I didn't understand his role at all . Maybe because of this he wasn't so good for me but I can understand . He was sometimes damn good but sometimes he looks like someone forced him to act . That is maybe false but it looks like this . There are so many his parts and he could do it better .This movie at all is very good and I am recommending it to everyone .,Brothers
101,d_art,"'Brothers' showcases strong, solid performances",8,23 February 2010,"Based on the Danish film, Brødre, Tobey Maguire plays Sam Cahill, a marine who goes off to Afghanistan and allegedly is killed in action. His brother Tommy, played by Jake Gyllenhaal, an ex-con, winds up looking after Sam's wife, Grace (Natalie Portman) and her daughters. As the story moves on, Tommy's negative attitude toward her and his outlook changes and their relationship develops. When Sam, who is found to be alive, returns home, there's a mixture of both joy and resentment among the characters, but to add, Sam has returned a changed and psychologically-damaged man.The film mainly focuses on the family drama and relationships of the characters, inter-cut with scenes of Sam in action and imprisoned/tortured in Afghanistan. The progression of the plot takes its time to develop, but it feels organic. The characters feel real. While one could see the film as a criticism of war and the negative effects that war has on the family of veterans, the film is more a character-driven drama, and doesn't touch much into politics.Admittedly, the plot itself isn't anything drastically new and one may imagine a plot like this in a made-for-TV drama if not for the emotional depth, intensity, and solid performances from Tobey Maguire, Jake Gyllenhaal, and Natalie Portman. One of the interesting plot points involve the brothers' father's (in a fine performance from Sam Shepard) favoritism for Sam, while looking down on Tommy as the ""failure."" The love/hate dynamics between the three are interesting and believable even as the two brothers go through drastic character changes.Tobey Maguire's performance is particularly noteworthy as Sam, a marine and a loving husband who comes back transformed into a physically emaciated, psychologically-scarred, ticking time bomb. My image of Tobey as Spider-Man now feels like a distant memory especially in comparison to what he portrays here. The two children who play the two daughters of Sam in this film give very natural performances in their varied reactions to difficult situations around them. Jake Gyllenhaal does strong work as Tommy, whose character transformation makes us want to root for him, despite his shady beginnings and flaws. To top off, Natalie Portman is radiant here, turning in a poignant, complex performance as a mother of two, who must deal with the initial mourning of her husband, the joy of his return, and the messy aftermath. Ultimately, her nuanced performance is the glue that holds the film together and make the other characters matter, and one can't help but marvel at the maturity of her performance.Directed by Jim Sheridan (The Boxer), this film is a great showcase for all performances involved, while portraying an engaging, intense story about familial loyalty, redemption, and difficult relationships. In the wrong hands, this film could've gone the route of the by-the-numbers Hollywood cliché, but as it is, it remains a solid drama. I give Brothers *** out of **** stars.More of my reviews are update on http://twitter.com/d_art",Brothers
102,Mobithailand,"This movie reaches startling heights of dramatic horror. A ""must see"".",9,5 May 2016,"'Brothers', is a very good movie about an American officer who is captured and held by terrorists in Afghanistan, and about his family back in the USA - in particular, the officer's wife and his ne'er-do- well, ex-convict brother. The officer eventually returns home but is assailed by personal 'demons'. The last part of the movie reaches startling heights of dramatic horror. I won't say any more, as I don't wish to spoil it for those who have yet to see it.Brothers didn't win any major awards, but I can assure you that the acting by all concerned is absolutely superb and the direction and overall production is peerless. It is a film that will shock you to your foundations and make you realise that 'we mere mortals' are not only fallible but also capable of change – sometimes for the better, and sometimes for the worst.

104,FilmFanatic03,"Great acting and storyline, though tainted by frequent foul language",6,26 March 2011,"Here we have a great ensemble cast: Tobey Maguire, Natalie Portman and Jake Gyllenhaul. All great actors and it was great casting to put them together. Natalie Portman was good in keeping her emotions reserved when she needed to but allows the audience to be welcomed into her character at some moments. Tobey Maguire really pulls off a dramatic, emotive and heart wrenching performance. Also Jake manages to play his role convincingly as the troubled brother who through the films situations learns how to better himself and overcome his troubles. The story was great, it kept you watching and you had no problem watching how all characters react to their situations. However, the thing which tainted the film and prevents me from saying i loved this film is the constant usage of the ""F"" word throughout. There was no need what so ever to use that sort of foul language. It was a shame because during Tobeys best acting moments he would constantly swear which tainted my view of his performance because the swearing was unpleasant. So, a good film which is not a great film, but could have been without the swearing. Such a shame when the cast and crew decided to contaminate a film with unnecessary language.",Brothers
105,athomed,A movie that wants to be so real,4,16 January 2010,"Before I start this review, I have to say that I walked out on this movie a little more than half way through it.The fact is that this can't be a real war drama about the trauma's of war while neglecting the war side of things. Those who worked on the Afghanistan scenes in this movie should be ashamed. This is not the Afghanistan I remember.First thing that really got to me was the helicopter with electrical malfunction. The odds that a million dollar piece of equipment malfunctions like that are incredibly slim, and over a river. The military would investigate the wreckage and find the bodies before declaring him 'presumed dead' or dead. Sam was held captive and forced to beat his comrade to death with a pipe. The convoluted plot that lead to this moment is almost as insane as that moment. His captors would have just killed them to rally local village leaders to their cause from the beginning.I'm giving this movie a 4/10 for the strength of it's acting. I had to walk out on this movie after the gross neglect of realism when it came to the Afghanistan scenes. It churns the pit of my stomach. If this is the cinema left behind from us to explain the Afghanistan war to future generations, we owe them an apology for the Hollywood version of it. If they want to play around with the facts in Afghanistan they should enlist.",Brothers
106,warthogjump,A decent movie,8,12 January 2010,"Brothers is a decent movie showing the trauma both a soldier and his family face due to Tobey Maguire's ""job"" as a marine. Although the script could have been improved and more drama could have been added throughout the movie, the actors in Brothers deliver superbly.Tobey Maguire is rumored to be mentioned at the Oscars and his performance probably deserves it, especially during his ""break down"" scene. Natalie Portman as the wife and Sam Shepard acting as the father also deliver plausible and emotional performances. Carey Mulligain, who I almost did not recognise, plays a cameo role and Clifton Collins Jnr also makes a brief appearance.If you haven't watched the trailer for this film, do not watch it as it gives much away. Also, do not read about this movie much before you watch it either. The less you know about Brothers, the better its plot will unfold.I also must point out that although Tobey Maguire is the one with the Golden Globe nomination and rumoured Oscar nomination, Jake Gyllenhaal delivers a much more subtle, and on the whole, a better performance than Tobey. He seemed to connect me more to his character with some comedic lines, gentle eyes and genuine acts of redemption. I rate Brothers one star higher because of Jake and if it were up to me, he'd get a supporting actor nomination.Don't expect a masterpiece like The Deer Hunter, but if you're looking for some new, depressive entertainment, then Brothers is a good flick...It had potential and it delivered on most of it; however, some potential was also left unaccounted for.",Brothers
107,TamPalm,Spiderman is a real actor!,6,6 December 2009,"I'm a little surprised at the high ratings thus far of this film. My instinct tells me that as there are more reviews, the rating my come down a tad to a more realistic number that better reflects the film--not necessarily the acting, but the overall film.And that is a key distinction. For the most part, the film is superbly cast. I think it's a little difficult at first to see Portman--a little girl-looking person--as a married mom of two children (not babies), but after you allow yourself to see her that way, she does the role well. I've never really gotten all the ""beautiful"" accolades she receives (even in this movie), to me she looks like a regular person you'd see on the street, but I will not begrudge that further. She did a decent job. Similarly, handsome Jake Gyllenall did a great job with his character, although the character was not well-developed. Somehow he went from a convict whose dad is disappointed in him to a family man. That journey is not documented very well, so it becomes difficult for the viewer to buy all the film is selling in that regard. On the other hand, I found the complexity given to Sam Shepard's character refreshing. At first it seemed he would play the typical dad role who is proud of the ""good"" son and abusive to the wayward one. But as the movie unfolds, his personal weakness is shown (alcholism) as well as his emotional strength, as his love for his wayward son (Gyllenhall) is revealed and welcomed.But as others have stated, the standout is Tobey Maguire. There is one particular seminal scene in which his acting chops are on full display. He trashes his kitchen after a less-than-pleasant family dinner and you are not human if you are not moved by it. My reaction after seeing his performance--""that's NOT Spiderman!"" lol So the acting--save that of the eldest daughter who unlike others I've read, I did not find particular impressive--is where the film succeeds. The plot development however is where the film fails. In fact, if I had one word to describe the film as a whole, it would be ""anti-climactic."" The ""climax"" of the film--the point at which the main character's source of inner conflict is revealed--has nothing to do with the film title and everything to do with a moment in the movie that is not really played up! And all that you spend the whole movie waiting to see--the big hoorah between the brothers--never happens! In this vein, the movie is scattered and could have used a much better script and defined direction. I could go on, but doing so would be giving too much of the film away--considering there's not much to the plot unfortunately.So for that reason--underdeveloped plot--the quality of the movie is taken away and I cannot in good conscience give it above a 6. Maguire's performance yes, it's near a 10, but even it cannot save a poorly developed story. How unfortunate too because this could have been one for the ages.",Brothers

The actors were very good, but too young. Perhaps the producers wanted to appeal to younger audiences, but they were wrong. If they were all a few years older it would have been more realistic. Speaking of reality...SPOILER ALERT. At the end when Toby goes off his rocker in front of the house and the police show up...WHERE ARE THE NEIGHBORS?? There was yelling, sirens and guns shots, but no one next door or across the street come out or even peek out through their windows? Not at all realistic.

109,Niv-1,Impressive,8,15 April 2010,I saw the Danish Brothers before I saw the remake and I read that the remake was too polished or studied but I thought the remake was able to evoke some of the original in tone. Tobey Maguire did a great job with PTSD. The girls birthday party and the trashing of the kitchen were where Maguire really acted well. Before I saw it I wondered about the actors being all a decade younger than the ones in the original but I think it worked. Directed by Jim Sheridan the movie is well acted across the board. The small roles are well cast like Sam Shepard as the father. He is very good. I also liked seeing Mare Winningham and Clifton Collins Jr. The girls who play Maguires daughters are also great. With this and In America he shows he really can direct kids realistically.,Brothers

I really enjoyed it and admit that it actually made me emotional. It is however, not without its flaws. In its effort to flush out its emotional and moving story, it comes across as heavy handed at some parts which makes it lose some of its momentum. And then birthday scene, where the little girl Isabelle says ""mom and Uncle Tommy have sex all the time""? That literally made zero sense. Like absolutely none. There is no plausible reason or way she would say that, or know how much that would affect her dad. It was ridiculous and unbelievable. Overall good movie, they just need to cut that entire birthday out completely.",Brothers
111,raimund-berger,Hugely disappointing tear squeezer.,4,1 January 2010,"Again, we're getting a melange of themes well covered by so many previous films. The good and the bad son story, courtesy East of Eden. The American marine hero story, who doesn't consider himself to be one due to what he knows. And the grieving wife potentially falling in love with another man story.The mere fact of those stories being that ubiquitous isn't so much of a problem though. Because theoretically they could still be better presented and dealt with each time around. No luck this time though, as all three of those threads ultimately fall flat all the same.As the bad son never really gets to talk to his father, so that conflict is never resolved properly. Apart from the father kind of starting to appreciate the bad son thanks to the latter renovating the kitchen of the grieving wife. Now, how satisfying is that.Next, the surprisingly homecoming marine suspecting his wife of unfaithfulness conflict never gets resolved. Because he never really talks to the man under suspicion, namely his own brother. So once more we're handed a loose end here.And finally, the American military heroism hypocrisy theme, where the marine is publicly considered a hero when, due to the dirtiness of war he went through, he shouldn't really be called one as to his own standards, that third theme falls flat just the same. Because the movie ends right when, for the first time, he's just able to talk to his wife about what he went through. Where the real story would actually begin at that very point, namely his process of recovery, how that would look like and how he would finally face the family he'd have some major guilt to admit to. All that, all the really interesting bits are passed over and getting ignored.So while story wise this film is a serious, and I mean serious, disappointment, I'd still give it points for the impressive cast. Although no film should use Maguire for a voice over, because that belongs to Spiderman. Especially a grown up Gyllenhaal seems to fulfill all the expectations he aroused as a young and aspiring actor. So much that I'd in fact love to see him entrusted with a really deep and demanding lead role of proper profile.So while the cast really seems to do what they can, I consider this film totally forgettable otherwise. A shallow and ultimately pretentious, utterly unsatisfying tear squeezer indeed. Message du jour to the writers: we know the wounds already, see the host of Vietnam films. You want to earn some credit, show us a believable healing.",Brothers

That's how life is sometimes.As I have said elsewhere: Most of the comments on IMDb contain the story line. I don't think it is necessary or advisable. But sharing your personal experience and analyzing it from the vantage point of your subjective reality could be enriching potentials of perception and preparing the one who didn't see the film yet. Equally it may give the confirmation of their own feelings, or a totally different angle to the they had. Naming who is playing whom is not necessary either - it's all on the title page.Goodness vs. badness - the split cardboard reality of a commoner's philosophy is masterfully challenged by this film.Sibling rivalry usually means for us, in a flat two-dimensional view, a competition between the brothers and sisters. The parents, superiors and other types of authorities are an intricate part of this process.The two pairs of same sex siblings and the interactions between all four of them is the real essence of this drama of Shakespearian proportions.I have not seen yet the original Danish film 'Broder', but in this remake the depth of the gap between integrity and opportunism is strikingly and powerfully illustrated.Great film.

114,Good-Will,Spielergian in its artifice. Watch and weep.,4,28 January 2010,"Anyone having seen Schindler's List will know that its sole purpose was to instill a sense of catharsis. Spielberg tugs away at your heartstrings so hard that eventually you bow down before the film simply due to emotional pressure.Spielberg embellished the ending of the well researched factual book by Thomas Keneally to appeal to the sense in all of us that we need to believe that some noble people made great sacrifices and took enormous risks during the holocaust.We know that. There's no need to exaggerate.This film does exactly the same thing, but in a way which is so cack-handed that logic starts to intrude into the audience's mind. And although logic doesn't make great drama, it stands in the way of hyperbole with a big stick and beats it to a pulp when it matters.And the issues and emotions raised in this film DO matter.Unfortunately there are so many emotional violins playing in the background that the sweeping orchestral piece that this film could have been is simply drowned out. Someone, somewhere needs to ask why the title of this film was so named. The bonds between the two brothers need to be established in more than a 2 minute car journey. The history of the characters needs to compel us to empathise with them. The post traumatic stress disorder condition and the modern treatment for it (Good or bad) needs to be shown.Otherwise this becomes another one of those worthy but pointless tear-jerking melodramas that some people love to love. See the other user comments.Personally, I didn't feel any empathy for any of the cardboard cutout characters or the dialogue during the wince inducing ""Family round the dinner tale"" scenes.In short: Soldier kills fellow soldier in order to survive but feels guilty and gets a bit messed up with his relationship with his wife and brother.What an amazing insight into the human soul.....Unless you are a director/screenwriter who wants to get those heartstrings and just pull..pull..pull..........",Brothers

116,ken_bethell,Families: A fine study of the real casualties of War,9,9 April 2010,"Doesn't Hollywood mystify you at times? It does me most notably in its decisions on what films to promote.'The Hurt Locker' was a decent film but you won't convince me that it wasn't hyped to bring about a scenario where a former husband and wife are in direct competition for the best picture award. 'The Hurt Locker' was good but 'Brothers' is infinitely better. As a study of the aftermath of conflict this film is outstanding. When the Tobey Maguire character returns psychologically-damaged from Afghanistan, his wife and family, who were only just coming to terms with his initially reported death, are confronted with this haunted and gaunt shadow of the former marine. Would this man ever recover? You are left with that uneasy feeling in the pit of your stomach that perhaps it would have been kinder for everyone had he remained dead. The acting was outstanding and such a shame that relatively few will see and admire it. It is unlikely that Maguire and Natalie Portman will ever perform better. As regards Portman my only criticism, if it could said to be a legitimate one,is that she is such a stunningly attractive young lady that she can be too diverting for serious drama.

(Tobey Maquire, meanwhile, is horribly miscast and is most unbelievable, unfortunately, when his character is most emotional: in his bug-eyed rage or evil-faced desperation, he makes you laugh or look away in embarrassment. The fact that he is also as pencil-necked as a 10th-grade chess champion doesn't help make him convincing as a gung-ho marine.) **SPOILERS FOLLOW**: What saves this film is the fact that it doesn't end in the typical blood bath or orgy of tragic domestic violence, which is what generally comes of the heavy-handed anti-war equation ""war turns men into animals.""

Perhaps it's not exactly the film's main title, because it's the tipping point of the film in the drowning of Sam in the outburst of personal thoughts.
what is the reactin conclusion of skeptic mind us? Why do we want or do not want it anymore? The two concepts go so far as to make people really feel at risk in dealing with these people.
Grace and Tommy's approach to Sam was very passive and conscious, so that they could not defend themselves much in their own innocence.
The director depicts the category of war to its subsequent works in a way that actually reflects the last sentence of the Sam.
He is severely lonely and completely abandoned in the swamp of his inner assumptions.The war ends only for those who are dead.
The staggering and strong points that are emerging as fundamental issues of the film are well illustrated by the shocking angles of a negative transformation for one called the national hero.
Perhaps one can appreciate that the best possible for a soldier is death, not life.",Brothers
119,eucalyptus9,Spoiled by the ending,5,15 July 2010,"I watched the original Danish version of this film some time ago. Connie Neilsen was stunning as the wife, Nikolas Lie Kaaj was good as the brother, and Ulrich Thomsen fitted the role of the Captain like a glove - mature, grave and, upon his return, with a sense of foreboding. In this remake, Natalie Portman is superb, while Jake Gyllenhaal, Sam Shepard and the 2 kids are all excellent. But Tobey Maguire is no Ulrich Thomsen. It's not that he's a bad actor, it's just that casting him as Captain Cahill of the Marines was akin to picking Russell Crowe to play Rudolph Nureyev in the film version of ""Swan Lake"".The other aspect in which seeing the Danish version first somewhat spoiled the remake was that a number of scenes were changed, some in only minor ways, but none for the better - the killing, the rescue, the post-rescue de-briefing and counselling (omitted here), the visit of the Captain to the private's wife and son. Most of all, in the Danish film, the whole movie was geared towards the revelations at the end, and when they came, they were emotional and powerful. In this film, it seems as though the producers ran out of time, or out of money, or out of interest. ""I killed him."" That's it. The End. Major disappointment.Pity, because it was quite a good story and quite a good film. I'd have given it 7, but that ending dumped it down to 5.",Brothers
120,evant299,A surprisingly good Drama Film!,9,13 August 2014,"I was not expecting this to be as good as it was. Tobey Maguire really showed how good his acting skills can be. He gave a surprisingly emotional and dramatic performance as a veteran who is struggling with the horrors of war and what he had to do during the war to survive. Jake Gylanhaul and Natalie Portman give great performances also but Tobey Maguire's performance stands out the most. The reason i gave it 9/10 instead of 10/10 is because the film started off slow but all in all it is definitely worth watching. It is a movie that fans of Tobey Maguire, Natalie Portman, or Jake Gylenhaal fans should see. Fans of drama/war films should also watch this.",Brothers

My experience of Tobey Maguire being limited to the Spider-Man films, it was a joy to see him flex his skills as a dramatic actor, most of his scenes left me on edge. The execution of themes surrounding war vets and the families they leave behind felt like an authentic portrayal and quite the tearjerker. I only wish Tobey McGuire had a little more screen time as I found him to be the most compelling on screen. Great supporting cast with young talent which is always a nice surprise.",Brothers
122,steve-ruzicka,Copy,6,5 April 2010,"Let me go counter-current to all the praising reviews. Nothing wrong with being critical when considering the tons of new movies produced by a wealthy industry. The script at first sight looks good, dramatic and moving. Given a little more thought however, serious flaws appear. The most important is that the movie is constructed from a series of other movies parts/ideas and reproduced as clichés: the imprisonment of soldiers in a hole, their forced video declaration and the execution of a fellowman; a declared dead soldier resurrecting; the brother affair with his sister in law; the obnoxious father waving the image of the example brother; the bad brother growing to the nice guy, playing with kids in the snow. And I could find more should I have a second viewing (no thank you). Another annoying flaw is the adult language and behavior of the elder daughter. Sorry, I don't buy it. And then finally Toby McGuire. I don't dispute his acting, I just don't see him as a credible adult. His voice, looks and acting belong to the teenager's world and Spiderman. Sorry for his fans. Sorry also to Mr. Sheridan and his producers, far more is needed to be at the top.",Brothers

His transition from being an every day dad, to a survivor or terrible war related tragedies was amazing. Jake and Natalie deliver amazing performances as well, and the entire movie was an emotional roller coaster. At times it made you laugh, cry, and cringe at the thoughts of what may happen next as Tobeys hostility grew throughout the final scenes. This movie was directed very well, and the dialog was very realistic though at times it could be a little intense. The tension between Tobey and his family members was outstanding, and I have been waiting on him to do something like this for a long time.

124,MisterMxyzptlk,Blood and Water,8,31 August 2010,"Brothers is a brilliant and heart wrenching story about family and the poisons of war. Actually, the war isn't the issue. It's a family drama by Jim Sheridan who knows the iconic American family very well. This amazingly put together film was wonderfully acted and abruptly mature. What's intriguing about this story of two brothers, one being the family golden boy, the other the local town screw up, is how quickly given the circumstances and environment is how things can suddenly get turned on it's ear. There is some tension filmed scenes here and Sheridan edits them and crafts them to perfection. Consider the scene at the youngest daughters birthday. Everyone in participation plays it straight and authentic. A strong shout to Bailee Madison as the troubled and deeply wise daughter watching her family torn to pieces.",Brothers

Maguire reaches into the darkest corners of his soul to flesh out the good brother, the Marine, who returns from Afghanistan with a staggering burden of guilt.Gyllenhaal is amazing, transforming an angry, unsure ex-con into a believable figure of redemption, slowly growing before our eyes as the story unfolds.Natalie Portman is excellent and look for Carey Mulligan's four minutes of screen time.This is not an anti-war film except in the sense that any film that shows war either glorifies it unrealistically or jars us into questioning, if it is realistic. The scenes in Afghanistan seem authentic. The tortures are not so so graphic as some of the other reviews imply. They will cause you to wince, but its good film making, not microscopic detail.I want to search out Susanne Bier's 2005 film ""Broedre""--it can't lessen the impact of this one, however.",Brothers
126,gsic_batou,Great drama about the traumas of war.,8,15 January 2010,"I tend to not be a big fan of contemporary American war movies as they can be so clearly patriotic that myself, as a non-American, will not so easily be moved simply by the depiction of US military war efforts.This is, however, a terrific exception. This movie, set in the ongoing Afghanistan war, manages to make a point that goes beyond American patriotism and support and enters the delicate but very real drama of post-war traumas.Tobey Maguire(in what is arguably his greatest achievement yet) plays the part of a marine who is captured and traumatized by an event, which I will not spoil as it adds much to the tension of the movie. Part of the movie deals with his incarceration and the other with his return home and his trouble on getting on with his life. Maguire's part is written subtly and he plays it to perfection, which is what makes this movie such a different experience.At the time of this writing IMDb rates ""Brothers"" 7.5. This is probably accurate, but mostly because of a commonplace direction that we've seen so many times. It does compensate in script and acting.""Brothers"" is compelling, intense and it makes you think when you're done.

Maybe more scenes with Toby Maguire and his family in the second half of the film may have been better, I just felt like we didn't get to see enough of him dealing with his family life.",Brothers
128,smoky_circles,Uneven movie with a dull first part but an intense second,7,6 January 2010,"The trailer for Brothers (which, by the way, basically gave away 5 second chunks from every important scene in the movie) had me waiting for it: I usually really like these kinds of troubling melodramas. This film does have the intended effect of the genre -- however, in a very small dose. It delivers only in the last quarter. The first 2/3 seem confused as to how to make things interesting until the major player returns, and time is spent away in an uneven and often flat tone. First and biggest complain: did a robot shoot and edit the movie? The camera work is completely static throughout. Now, that is great in the last and very intense quarter, such as the dinner scene, where you are so intensely concentrating on the characters all gathered in a small, uncomfortable space and their interactions. But through the initial 2/3, when Tommy and family is getting close, and Tommy and Grace are getting close, and when the kids are playing in the snow, people are mourning, Sam is suffering, etc, the totally still camera and abrupt scene changes felt really clunky and reluctant, often edging on boring. One second I'd see Tommy playing with the kids, then, blink, Sam's starving in a ditch, then, blink, Tommy's talking to the father. Let me feel something, let it sink in first! Natalie Portman. I'm not the biggest fan of her, having seen her only good performance way back in Leon. But in this movie she was definitely miscast and at about 10% of her potential-- in other words, her acting is awful here. Her character is already underdeveloped, saying little of the kind of important stuff you feel that she should say, or, heck, say anything at all, since she's pretty quiet throughout of the movie (well, it's not a very loquacious movie after all). But Portman's eyes and face often show no feeling or don't show feeling appropriate to the scene. In one scene Maguire's character, on the verge of breakdown and rage, asks her something like 'do you know what I did?' with a little bit of the psycho in him, and she replies in a very wooden and robotic tone, 'no, I don't'. Similar problems abound when her husband is either trying to vent or reach out. You can't see if she's disappointed in her husband, saddened by his transformation, or yearning for his old self. Often I just didn't see anything there. No thought, no emotion. It's not all bad though. There is one great scene when an army widow admits to having a disturbing dream about Sam. Grace (Portman) notices Sam in the next room, goes up to see him, but she leans against the corner wall so that only some of her face is visible, like she is hiding. It completely shows how she is somewhat frightened of him and that their bond is lost. Tobey: Hard to believe it's the same actor who played the adorable character in Cider House Rules. And the movie picks up dramatically when he reappears (it seems as if the creators were more excited about the downward spiral than what was happening before it. They should have balanced matters more evenly in the first half, and really formed a full life for the family w/ and w/o Sam). Maguire's face, generally used for cuteness and innocence in CHRules, pleasantville, and spidey movies, has been transformed with great effectiveness here. His large, round, blue eyes surround an emaciated, scarred, shaved head, giving them a bulged, surprised-angry look. When he's come back and is with his family, listening to his daughter telling jokes he can no longer find humor in, he has this stiff, fake smile like he's trying to be kind and good humored under a pretense of total anger and loathing. Visible also when he asks his brother and wife the impossible question. The dinner-balloon scene is where Maguire really shines. You are almost scared for the older daughter, the one Sam is directing his quiet anger towards. And yes, the older child actor is amazing. Other complaint that I won't go much into: the titular theme of Brotherhood wasn't really established much with relevance to the experiences of each (again, something they could have done more of in the first half). There was also a connection related to this theme with the daughters: how the younger is beloved and spoiled, while the older doesn't get the same showering of affection for whatever reasons. The inadequate foundation on their brotherhood also takes away from the resolution. We know that one rises while the other falls, and that their ties finally save them, but their ties aren't really established fully in the important beginning scenes. Still, beside the complaints, I thought it was pretty good and the last part saved it for me. I would recommend it for the melodrama, a raging and paranoid Maguire, Jake Gyllenhaal whom I always like, and depiction of war anguish including the fight for survival and the trauma of killing on a normal, sensitive human.",Brothers
129,cl777,"Loyalty, love, faithfulness, duty, pain, grief. Well above average but not outstanding",8,16 February 2010,"Brothers, starring Jake Gyllenhaal, Natalie Portman and Tobey Maguire, is an interesting and profound drama about family values, war, and relationships. The acting is fantastic. I had hardly heard of this movie despite its all star cast so it was a pleasant surprise for me.As the title implies, it is about two brothers, portrayed by Gyllenhaal and Maguire, whose lives have taken them to different sides of the tracks- Jake's character has recently been released from jail and Tobey is a devoted family and army man. Natalie Portman plays his lovely wife. When Tobey is sent away to Afghanistan and rapidly presumed dead, the plot thickens.Back at home, with everybody trying to cope and go on with their lives, nothing will ever be the same. I will not write any more on the subject because although I found what happens next very predictable, you should still guess for yourselves.The entire cast plays superbly. Tobey undergoes a massive physical transformation and looks completely emaciated as he depicts the mental decline of someone who has lived through too much horror. He shows us the mental destruction caused by war and his metamorphosis is truly scary at times. Jake is really excellent as his sincere brother, torn between passion and brotherly love, guilt and devotion. The two young girls who play Tobey and Natalie's daughters were very impressive and are earning lots of praise.The supporting characters are less developed and the father seems to have just two states of emotion- praise and admiration for his army son and disdain for the ex-convict. This is the downside that I saw in Brothers- that it tended to oversimplify many issues and too often contented itself with merely scratching the surface. For instance, though I have never been in a war so I cannot say for sure, the Taliban scenes seemed fake to me.Loyalty, love, faithfulness, duty, pain, grief, sorrow, joy. All of these are present in this well above average but not outstanding film.My rating: 8 Fabio's: 7.5 Total score: 15.5 Please read more reviews at http://paulinasmovies.blogspot.com",Brothers
130,Rafacus,A touching movie about the true meaning of brotherly love.,10,4 December 2009,"Brothers is the 2nd War themed movie of 2009 to emphasize the human psyche over guts and glory. Where Mel Gibson's We Were Soldiers faltered at bringing home the sense of loss and devastation that the wives and mothers endure during wartime, Jim Sheridan nails it by keeping it personal in this film. There are no glorious shootouts, or supermen taking out hundreds with a pistol through a hailstorm of shrapnel. What we get is the premise of loyalty, bravery and sacrifice through soldier and civilian alike in a powerful drama appropriately named for the love between Tommy and Sam.It strategically starts with a contrast to play on our assumptions. The sharp, dedicated and disciplined soldier in Sam Cahill swings by the jailhouse to pick up his tattooed, wise-cracking drunk of a brother in Tommy. The two don't say much as they drive home to reunite with family but the tiny exchanges and generally awesome acting by both Jake Gyllenhaal and Toby Maguire gives you the feeling that these two are very close. Ultimately it is all that is needed for the audience, so when the hardened military father comes down on his failure of a son (Tommy) it isn't surprising that it's his ""good son"", the war hero (Sam) that bridges the rift between the two. The beautiful and talented Natalie Portman plays the part of Sam's wife Grace, a mother to 2 cute daughters in Isabelle (Bailie Madison) and her younger sister Maggie (Taylor Geare). The kids are smart and Isabelle especially is beyond her years, they are saddened upon hearing that their dad is to be deployed but it all dissipates when he tucks them into bed lovingly. It is the setup for the meat and potatoes of Brothers when Sam becomes a prisoner of war assumed dead and his brother Tommy is there to pick up the broken pieces at home with his family.Jake Gyllenhaal and Toby Maguire really show their acting chops throughout this story. The awkward familiarity of the misunderstood bad-boy that is Tommy was as believable as the calm, zen-like, monk of a soldier that is Sam. The chemistry was cooking whenever they shared a scene and between the similarity of their looks and the dramatic situations that they played out I found myself fully immersed into their struggles to cope. The father played by Sam Shepard was equally impressive as the old, battered war vet, Portman as the strong wife and her children (who were given much camera time), played their respective roles convincingly.Brothers is real drama and though there are a few supporting characters, it never veers away from the core family. With the movie taking place in 2007, and our recent push into Afghanistan, the relevance will be there for a lot of people who have loved ones in action or soon to be. I cannot use the word Oscar bait for Brothers, though the release date and heavy drama may lead one to feel this way. What I found Brothers to be was a beautiful drama with tones as heavy as any other well written movie that I can think of. Toby Maguire must have put his body through hell to look the way he does on this movie – rail thin, crazed and sickly. For me Brothers was a salute to acting, good story and the power to evoke emotion from an audience. Great dialogue, a few twists and turns along with a decent score – the things that make me love the theater. If you haven't seen this yet, I really encourage you to get out and see it, you will not be disappointed.",Brothers
131,jgrayson_au,"Miscast, cheesy and predictable mess",4,25 March 2010,"Starting with the casting, and already errors arise. Whilst I'm aware that Toby was born in 1975, he looks too young for this roll. Even Natalie Portman looks a bit young, but watching Toby, especially in the opening scenes, breaks the false reality. Toby is playing a captain, when half the privates look older than him.Moving on from the casting, we have the story itself. It's rather predictable and slow moving. I could sum up the entire movie in about 2 paragraphs. What angered me most of all was they hinted at some potentially interesting side stories, none of which was expanded upon. The movie sticks to the main plot line, which is only about the emotions of the characters.The dialogue is also quite predictable. Some of the lines and situations are just painful to watch. In fact the only scenes I found 'real' were the one with the friends in the kitchen. The conversations between the main characters all seemed strained at the best.If the movie had taken the plot, and actually showed things that were talked about (for instance, how Jake ended up in jail), I would have been more forgiving. There would have been more 'stuff' in the story. As it stands though, the movie is a bare bones emotional story, with frankly not much going on, no side-stories to keep you interested, bad dialogue, and poor casting. If this had no-name actors in it it'd be on the Hallmark channel.4/10",Brothers

I have seen all movies of both actors and I was really impressed when I saw this movie.The film is about two brothers with different personalities. Sam (Maguire) is a Marine Captain and is married to Grace (Portman) and has two children named Isabelle and Maggie. His younger brother Tommy (Gyllenhaal) is an ex-convict who just got out of prison after serving five years for bank robbery. Everybody in the family hates Tommy, except Sam. One day when Sam goes missing in Afghanistan, everybody in the family thought he was dead. Tommy takes care of Sam's family and a love begins to blossom between Tommy and Grace. Several months later, Sam returns home after being forced to kill his friend Private Joe Willis when they were taken prisoners in a mountain village in Afghanistan. The fact that he killed Willis drifts Sam's mind and makes him to become a psychopath gradually. He begins to suspect that Grace and Tommy have slept together and his children begin to lose the love they have for him gradually.One day when Tommy brings a girl at Maggie's birthday party, Isabelle becomes jealous and claims that what Sam suspects about Tommy and Grace is true. Sam becomes enraged, destroys the new kitchen which was remodeled by Tommy and tries to commit suicide by holding a gun against his head. Tommy tries to calm him down and convinces him by saying that what he believes is wrong. The police arrive and Sam begins to think. After a little dramatic moment Sam surrenders.Sam is admitted at a mental hospital and Grace comes to visit him. Grace tells him that if he doesn't tell her about what that bothers him, he will lose her forever. Sam opens up his feelings and admits that he killed his friend Private Joe Willis. The film ends with a letter that is read by the husband: I don't know who said only the dead have seen the end of war. I have seen the end of war. The question is: Can I live again?After I saw this movie I realized that there is another side of Maguire that people might have not seen yet. I was used to see the Maguire from Wonder Boys and the Spider-Man films, but after seeing this movie I was really shocked and surprised and I must admit that Tobey Maguire has showed himself as phenomenal actor. He has truly deserved the Golden Globe nomination.Jake Gyllenhaal and Natalie Portman are at their best as usual and Bailee Madison has delivered a fantastic performance as playing Sam and Grace's daughter Isabelle. Sam Shepard who played Sam and Tommy's father Hank Cahill has also done an excellent work as playing a father who always compares his both sons. ''Brothers'' is a remake of a Danish movie named ''Brødre'' (English: Brothers) and the director, Jim Sheridan did not fail to deliver the audience a mind-blowing drama.

138,LiveYoLifeLikeYouMeanIt,Potent,9,2 September 2015,"Brothers is a very well-crafted and supremely acted movie starring a powerhouse cast comprising Tobey Maguire, Jake Gyllenhaal and Natalie Portman. Brothers is one of those movies that is thoroughly engaging from first shot to last and is able to exude this constant enchanting aura that gives weighted emotion to every one of its scenes. Its story isn't exactly original, a point that I will return to in a few moments, but is memorable due to the careful and precise direction, the pleasantly intense background score that captures the depth of every scene, and most of all, the acting by the entire cast, especially Tobey Maguire. Tobey Maguire plays his role with absolute and terrifying dedication, for his performance was very intense and heartfelt. He perfectly depicts the ways in which war can and does change the lives of the soldiers it harbours and the extent to which such strains can lead family life astray. And exactly where Tobey was very expressive and full blown, the always reliable Jake Gyllenhaal gives a more subtle performance with equal fervour and impact. Natalie Portman holds her own fort and is able to evict true emotion and feeling in the viewer. The two little girls in the film are surprisingly very good, so much so that they nearly manage to steal some scenes from their elder, more qualified counterparts. Having spoken about the acting, it's time to talk about Jim Sheridan's direction. Sheridan's direction is reserved and confident, and expertly brings to life the events on screen. Each scene is well thought out and shown with the maximum attention to detail. A dinner scene in the third half of the movie is astounding in it's craft, with every little manoeuvre and expression captivatingly unveiled, with the whole act being thoroughly dramatic and power-packed. This really is potent direction that is worthy of much praise. Some people deride the movie citing it as too melodramatic, and still others consider it generic Hollywood fare about how war affects people's lives. I believe this is hypocritical in nature, because this is rather unwarranted. Firstly, about this supposedly being melodramatic, I would like to point out that the movie was very reserved in its depiction of pain and suffering in most parts, while only reaching it's dramatic crescendo in the final ten minutes, which was very much necessary, especially considering how well acted the scenes in question were, and hence dismissing the entire movie as melodrama is unfair. And about it being a very generic tale about war, makes me wonder what this movie could have done differently to have not been 'generic'. Were it to focus more on the War itself, it would have been termed as pointless action with no dramatic heft, and since it does focus on the psychological effects of war, it is considered generic with striking comparisons with the 1978 classic 'The deer hunter'. This nature of belittling a movie released years after another, dealing with a 'similar' concept and theme, which in fact, is very much grounded in its own reality and carves its own character arcs, is once again unfair. Finally, I would like to say that Brothers is very strong, heartfelt entertainment that has been overlooked for some of the reasons stated and rebuttled above. The greatest strength of this movie is the acting it features and is truly an underrated gem.",Brothers
139,Kareninysimba,"Unexpectedly good, very good",8,8 January 2010,"The way they decided to launch the trailer definitely made me stay away from the idea of stepping inside to see this movie. The soup opera love-tormented-triangle induced by it wasn't attractive to me, but thanks to my girlfriend, who was definitely attracted to the plot, we gave it a shot.The directorial style, the heavy war-trauma subject, Tobey Maguire's acting, was something I was not expecting. The tension and suspense are masterfully crafted, the use of several camera angles in a small steady situation with the help of elaborate edition and montage, was a key plus of my admiration. The soup opera style suggested by the trailers/posters, in my humble opinion, is not the real spinal cord of the story, thankfully.The has in my opinion a couple of memorable milestone scenes that really created a difficult to produce tension in me, out of relatively simple, every day situations as a dinner or as ""trashing the place over"", many times seen in movies but crafted here in a artful way and an style arguably never before seen.Tobey Maguire clearly delivers his best performance ever as a war-seduced veteran who undergoes bad enough war trauma to find out more tormenting haunting issues when is back home. His acting, and his physical transformation are both a combination playing for a sure winning bet for an Academy Award nod this year.Seeing Natalie Portman as an accomplished dedicated young housewife mother of two for the first time felt a bit awkward, initially, but thanks to her superb talent and solid performance makes the new role grow in you and helps digesting it slowly as the movie passes by.Jake Gyllenhaal delivers his usual introspective rather too laid back character in a certainly convincing credible fashion as the rebel brother who has always being the black sheep of the family coming forward for a formidable redemption.A great, well created wake up call on the current war veteran issues. An excellent movie, higher than expected. 8 out 10.",Brothers
140,ericjams,"Powerful movie, great individual performances, a few flaws",7,5 December 2009,"The trio of Jake Gyllenhaal, Tobey Macguire and Natalie Portman got me very excited for this film, and from an acting standpoint, they did not disappoint. The script gives Macguire the most to work with as the family man/Marine, Sam Cahill, whose latest trip to Afghanistan sees him imprisoned by the Taliban and ultimately returned to America with some serious psychological issues. While he is MIA, his wife, Grace, (Portman) and ex-con brother, Tommy, (Gyllenhaal) are told he is dead, and the two grow closer, eventually verging on emotional and physical attachment.Ultimately, the movie is an emotional ringer. Sam returns to a family that wants to love him, but his walls are up, he's been through a lot and its his brother the fun loving Uncle Tommy who Sam's children want to play with. A quick note, Sheridan the director makes great use of the two daughters as comic breaks in otherwise terribly tense situations. Our theater was laughing at the kids and it felt to me, as though we needed that laughter to balance out the gloom. There are a few climaxes, some extremely tense family dinners and finally a final gripping scene where Sam is pushed to the brink, he distrusts his wife, assumes his brother is sleeping with her, and no longer can see the humor in his elementary aged children, can he hold on?Its a touching film and a sad film, but it probably could have been a bit better. The script and title of the film suggest a big tension or interplay between the brothers. I found the brother relationship lacking in substance, and I thought the ingredients for some serious tension and emotional pain were in place but were never put to use. Sam Shepard does well as the Vietnam Vet father, but all he really does is establish his love for his son, the Marine, and his disdain for his son, the ex-con. There was so much more that he could have done, his role seems intentionally diminished. Portman is great as usual, but arguably miscast, as she doesn't belong cast into a film where she is not supposed to think. She's a thinking woman's actress and here she is left observing, we know she knows, but her character must play it clueless.I cried, and wanted the story to continue, as there seems to be a bit left to this story when the film fades away. Both signs that the movie was enjoyable and touching. The growth of Gyllenhaal as the ex-con who is on the rise, adjusting to life on the outside and acting as a surrogate father in the absence of Macguire is nicely juxtaposed with Macguire's devolution into post-traumatic stress ridden torment. Watch the Oscar nods roll in, but I think, if anything, the movie may win individual awards, as the product as a whole falls quite a bit short of award winning status.",Brothers

142,jagooch,Not Moving at All,2,2 January 2010,"Watching this movie was a last minute decision by my group of friends, and I went in with no idea of what it was going to be about.The short version of my review is that this movie intends to be gritty, emotional, and controversial at the same time, but it fails to get you attached to any of the characters. Since you don't care about them, the film fails to achieve any of its goals. I'd compare it to reading a newspaper article about something controversial, like ""man robs store"". You don't like that the store was robbed, you would probably feel bad for the storekeeper who was held at gunpoint, and you might be curious as to what drove the thief to commit the armed robbery, but you don't know enough to pursue really get emotionally involved. You conclusion might be ""that sucks, I hope they catch him."" The beginning is supposed to understand what leads up to the act that the rest of the movie pivots around, but it fails to connect you to the mind of the main character. Good luck trying to figure out what he's going through mentally by the expression on his face.The next part tries to develop another controversial moment, but again you don't connect to the characters, so they could doing the most atrocious things and you wouldn't feel anything.The last part of the final is supposed to be a psychological journey that puts you in suspense as to how things will end up. I was only in suspense to see how the theater manager would respond to my request for my money back.It's sad to leave a negative review since I've been a Natalie Portman fan for quite a while, her acting is fine, but she can't make the storyline interesting. I think they really wanted something Oscar worthy with this film, and ended up with a $5 bin movie.Someone should have been asking questions like ""how do they know what the character is feeling?"", ""why does the viewer care?"", and maybe through in a ""how can we create the feeling of suspense at the end?""",Brothers

I love how Tobeys character was so calm throughout the whole movie until the end where he finally lashes out. There's an academy award right there. No special effects, no stupid sci-fi which weve been getting way too much these days, and no complex back and forth up and down, left and right story lines. Just a simple great movie to enjoy.

Tobey McGuire and Natalie Portman can usually hold their own, while they aren't my favorite. Unfortunately, this movie turned out to be exactly what I hoped it wouldn't be: a dragged out story that was remade to be numbed down for American audiences. For people that think I am being harsh, watch the original Danish film that this movie was based off of. In it, one will see a well orchestrated story that uses the pacing, characters, and cinema to take it to the next level.",Brothers
147,lordbowler,A good War story that is not too left-biased.,8,13 June 2010,"It really upsets me when I watch a war drama where the soldiers all become sociopaths after returning home or war-lovers while in combat.I'm sure there is a percentage of those in war, but I refuse to believe that the majority are that.Things I liked about this film was the family pulling together to help each other out.SPOILER WARNING***** Things I like most about this movie: When Sam is presumed dead, Tommy becomes a better man and stands in for his brother to help his wife and kids becoming a much needed father figure.I also liked the fact that Tommy and Grace did not actually sleep together. While the relationship was headed in that direction, I was happy that they did not consummate the relationship during the relatively short period of time that this story covers. I don't think the family could recover from this betrayal.I also liked most is how Tommy ""saves"" Sam from drowning at the end of picture. It is a nice book-end to the story as Tommy relates to Sam's girls how Sam saved Tommy from drowning when they were kids.I also liked how their father, a Vietnam vet, admitted that he was abusive and offered his ear to Sam. It would have been nice to have added more soldier-to-soldier drama between Sam and his father about the reality of war.I did not like Jarhead at all, and I enjoy war pictures having seen hundreds of American war dramas. I've also read many non-fiction books about America's Wars. I am not naive that war is what is portrayed by John Wayne.END SPOILER WARNING***** I found the actors to be very good in this movie with Jake Gyllenhaal giving an outstanding performance that is better than Maguire's. This is no slam on Maguire, as both he and Portman give great performances as well.All-in-all a great film. I liked this more than Home of the Brave.I'd also recommend Ride With the Devil starring Maguire about the Civil War in the West. Another great picture with a great performance by Tobey Maguire.",Brothers
148,mspieway,What a waste of time,1,6 April 2010,"I have so many questions & concerns about this movie. Why is the soldier declared dead, instead of MIA? Obviously no body was found. Why does the military conduct a funeral? Why does the loser brother hang around so much? Why does the wife attempt to dump her 'goody two-shoes' image and smoke pot with the ex-con drunk brother-in-law? Who thought up the scene of the fatal beating in the terrorist camp? Why did the film have to rely on such clichés as: *ex-Marine dad favoring one son. *wife & bro-in-law getting it on. *creepy-looking daughter not getting any help in reconnecting w/her dad(hey thanks prev poster, i forgot all about the creepy daughter & her way-too-adult commentary about 'mom would rather sleep w/uncle' at the dining table=what drivel!). *wife kissing war scars on back. *dead soldier buddy's wife with dreams too close to the truth. Why is soldier not told that his dead buddy's wife is visiting?Also, it took a very short time till wife gives his clothes away. Yet she did not have the will to read his last letter to her?All in all, another war movie made by Hollywood, not by soldiers! As for the stars, Portman is a stone face, brings no acting skills at all. McGuire is overboard with the haunted thin look (yet no one seems to think he is ready to crack & leaves a gun around?). Gyllenhal (sp?) for some reason, irritated me no end, playing the cocky son to his (justified) father's disgust. Save your money, don't waste your time.",Brothers

151,Jaspa1982,Interesting and moving drama,9,9 January 2019,"Brothers is a remake of a Danish film of the same name and the original film is a very roughly made, improvised work, so the gloss of Hollywood could have hurt it.However, Brothers is a remake that works totally and for a number of reasons. The writers have pedigree, with David Benioff (of the excellent 25th Hour) joining the original writers (and director) of the Danish movie. The themes are relevant and timely, with the war in Afghanistan and its affect on the west being reflected in this family story. And the setting is well observed, demonstrating that it's ordinary families and communities that are so often hit hardest by war.Jim Sheridan is a good choice of director. He makes dramatic, character driven movies about people and families in crisis. What he does best here is keep the action restrained because these very dramatic stories, based around key scenes of high drama, can easily get overwrought - people crying, falling into desperation and facing life and death decisions - it can all get a bit much! Sheridan focuses on how this action affects the people and their relationships, not simply on providing intense, overacted scenes of no consequence.The actors are wonderful, keeping that important restraint but pushing emotions where necessary - a fine balance to achieve.This is strong drama for adults, such a rare thing from Hollywood these days.",Brothers
152,joetufano882,"Very effective drama, with powerhouse performances",9,6 January 2015,"I've only watched this one time because it's not something you can watch over and over again, but this is a film that shows a side of the military that we don't really like to know exists. United States Marine Corps Captain Sam Cahill (Tobey Maguire) goes missing while on deployment in Afghanistan, reported killed in action and his family back home try to adjust to his absence. His wife Grace (Natalie Portman) tries to care for her children with the help of her husband's brother Tommy (Jake Gyllenhaal) who is the opposite of his brother Sam. They soon develop intimate feelings towards one another but only go as far as sharing a kiss. Sam is discovered to be alive and returns home, but is clearly traumatized by his experiences. I won't say what they are, but that combined with Sam noticing the looks shared between his wife and brother cause him to have a huge emotional break down. The premise is nothing entirely original, the film's real strength is it's three lead actors. Natalie Portman is really great at playing the military wife who tries to care for her family and support her husband as best as she can, Gyllenhaal is really good as Tommy who redeems himself in his family's eyes since he did time in jail. I'm not a huge fan of Jake Gyllenhaal, but think he's a very talented actor and like I said is really good here. And lastly, the frequently and unfairly maligned Tobey Maguire sells the hell out of it and arguably gives the best performance out the entire cast. I've always liked Maguire as an an actor prior to this movie with his run as Peter Parker/Spider-Man, Red Pollard in Seabiscuit and Homer Wells in Cider House Rules, but this is probably the best performance I've ever seen from him and that I think is Oscar worthy. As someone who is in the US military even though I've never seen combat, I've met a few people in the service who you can tell have been in combat because of the look in their eyes. And Maguire does that perfectly. And I've never really got the hate towards Tobey Maguire as an actor either. Seriously guys, leave him alone! While the premise is nothing entirely original, it's a very effect drama that shows the effects of war on those who serve in the war and their families, and it benefits from strong performances by it's three leads, especially Tobey Maguire.",Brothers

That gave me hope. I kept on feeling like this was going to be a ""Pearl Harbor"" plot . . . and I just wasn't interested - but it wasn't until nearly 80 minutes into the movie that I realized that I had been duped -- the marketing of this movie really IS MISLEADING AND not a good fit for the film . . .Anyway, I don't want to give anything away.

156,MovieEnthusiast13,Brothers is a success in both character and emotion,7,4 August 2010,"Brothers is a great war movie about the effects of war on the mind and on family. The story is told trough great direction, but the main beauty of the film comes from the extremely gifted cast.Tobey Maguire plays Cap. Sam Cahill, a US Army Captain who is happily married to Grace (Natalie Portman). Together they have two little girls named Isabelle and Maggie. Then Sam is sent back to Afghanistan just after his brother, Tommy (Jake Gyllenhaal), is released from prison for armed robbery.As Tommy tries to fit into the family and become friends with Grace and the kids, his father Frank Cahill makes sure Tommy knows how proud he is of Sam, and how disappointed he is in Tommy. While in Afghanistan, Sam and his buddies are taken prisoner by a local militia group. After having endured horrible situations, Sam finally makes it out alive. When he arrives back home, his family assumes he is dead and Grace and Tommy have gotten closer. Sam, still struggling from the emotional pressure of war, becomes weary of how close Tommy and his wife really are. This all defuses in an outburst of violence.The acting is great in this movie. Gyllenhaal and Maguire are both young stars who I might not have pictured together, but it really works. They get the brothers relationship perfectly, especially as Sam is the 'good' one- but they still get a long. Gyllenhaal is a gifted young actor and has already proved it. Tobey Maguire is famous (because of Spiderman) but he has never been considered a good actor before this. In Brothers, he is brilliant. This is by far Maguire's best role yet, he portrays the difficulty of war well and his best scene comes when he snaps.The direction and cinematography are all good. The music is very good featuring tracks from The Fray and U2 which set the perfect tone for this emotional film. The movie can be sad, but it is very good. I highly recommend it to people who enjoy movies about the effects of war at home, and who appreciate good acting.",Brothers
157,kaustubh241997,Can i live again ?,9,29 August 2015,"Backtracking my IMDb profile is likely to lead you to reviews that are well structured and written with the critical analysis of a few days. This review however is something that I am typing nearly shivering , moments after watching this progressive direction and impeccable performance. Now this is an unconventional review , but bear with me as I will clearly explain why this is an under-rated gem you must watch right away if you didn't. First thing of the bat let me start by saying that this movie is not something that will be known for it's story. Being a re-make it has it's own flaws , in fact the almost perfect 10 score is nowhere placed for it's story as it is probably a generic war hero story of a scarred marine we have watched a million times. In fact this movie is more of Tom Hank's Cast away that shows more of Tom Hanks after coming back home.You might have noticed that my review started with me stating that I was moved by Impeccable performance and not performances. The cast is just superb , all the way from Jake to the small girls who portrayed the traumatised and puzzled kids. But one man who rose from the potentially overshadowing cast is Toby Maguire. Let me assure you , that this is probably his best performance of his career. Coming hot out of a comic book character , Toby has proved himself to be a character that can physically and mentally morph himself to produce magic on screen. The entire movie is his transformation , it is him breaking down , it is him trying to fix a part of himself that can never be undone. The last 30 minutes of this movie is a testament to my belief in Toby. And the last 10 minutes of the movie is probably where he will force you to nearly break down. I almost did , and that hasn't happened in a very long time.But what is performance without a boss behind the camera. Jim Sheridan might be the one known for his work in other titles like "" In America "" and "" The Boxer "" , but he has done a brilliant job in making this movie not just a drama but an atmospheric thriller. Without spoiling much , there is a scene towards the end that has an intense buildup , for 5 minutes that leads to a brilliant pay off. The camera has quick , nimble switches , some characters focused , some made to hide themselves , to symbolize hidden emotions. Every minute detail of this movie , all the way from substantial lighting to tonal shifts , Jim has done a beautiful job at creating a fractured and wounded universe , which in conjunction with the acting resonates to give a message , strong and sharp.Looking at the cast of the movie it's hard to believe how Nightcrawler's Jake , Black Swan's Portman , and the right stuff's Sam had nearly little but equally important roles to play where the sleeper hero Toby just manages to steal the show and knock it off the park. You might just think "" I am high of my popcorn "" but this my genuine expression. There hasn't been a movie this intriguing in a very long time that has pursued me to open my laptop right away and write this extra ling review. It's been 6 years since this movie has been out and this is my second viewing. So let this review be a reminder that the movie stood good then , now and will grow on you to be much better, as time passes by.",Brothers

159,prairiedances,Better Editing would have Saved this Film,5,15 January 2010,"The main issue with this movie is editing. Think about how fantastic it would have been if as Natalie Portman's character finds out what McGuire did the audience does too through flashbacks? Having the war part and the home font part going back and forth took away a lot of the mystery because the whole time the audience knows exactly what Sam did and why he's so messed up. If we had been allowed to discover it along with Portman the ending would of had a lot more impact.I also would of put more focus on the ""brothers"" aspect. McGuire and Gyllenhaal both act very well in the movie (though McGuire is the real star of Brothers-who knew he could act?) and try to sell their so-called connection as best they could. However, as written the brothers part is so underdeveloped that I walked away from the movie thinking it shouldn't of been called Brothers in the first place.The characters could of grieved for Sam a bit more. The writers/director etc. relied too much on dialogue to tell the story (ie Portman's character says she was so sad she couldn't get out of bed, Gyllenhaal says he misses Sam) and didn't try to show us more. I know the kids were young and had issues but they could of seemed a tad bit more upset that their father was dead.But basically my main issue is how the movie was edited. I almost wish they could go back and reorder it and have the audience find out what happened to Sam at the end. If that had been done I think it would of been a great movie with fantastic acting as apposed to a average movie saved by stellar performances.",Brothers
160,IgiS,Compelling drama about various types of war,8,1 January 2010,"I've never seen original danish film, on which director Jim Sheridan based his, so my review is entirely free of any comparisons. Brothers tells a story of a family, and shows how significant events in one person's life can affect others around. When Sam(played bravely by Tobey Maguire) gets deployed in Afghanistan and then goes missing and declared dead, his younger brother Tommy(Jake Gyllenhaal) steps up to help Sam's wife Grace(Natalie Portman)who now became alone with two little daughters and house to maintain. Tommy is nothing like his older brother, of which their father(Sam Shepard) can't stop reminding him. But now feeling responsible to help Grace, he can channel his guilt and grief by doing good deeds around the household.He even renovates the kitchen. During this time we see as Tommy's bond with Grace and children tightens. It won't be much of a spoiler when I write that later on Sam prove himself to be alive(every video merchandise of this movie shows that)and eventually reunited with his family at home in US. But like I wrote at the beginning almost everything has changed since he left. Can he forget events he was displayed to at war? We've seen many different movies about coming home from war, and trying to deal with ordinary life once again, after being exposed to devastating things, but the way Tobey Maguire portrays it, being locked up within himself, coping with PTSD behavior, is spectacular. In fact acting from all three leads is the strongest virtue of Sheridan's movie. If you can say something unflattering about ""Brothers"" it is that script seems quite conventional, the way story unfolds. It is very strong movie,you may not fall in love with it as it is rather sad and dark but you're ought to admire and respect it for not sugarcoating anything, just showing how complex and rather grey than black or whit life tends to be.",Brothers
161,dimitriscisse,This is a good movie but...,7,23 July 2015,"The film was enough good. We watch the history of family four-member with father military and uncle(brother Tommy) released. I liked a lot the interpretations of actors, however the direction was mediocre. The director did not show perfectly the attraction between Grace and Tommy. ""I wanted focuses more in the force of love and that the life is continues afterwards the """" death"" 'of Tommy in Afghanistan. Many viewers are disturbed because of this line : ''You are just mad because she would rather sleep with uncle Tommy than you! '' by Isabelle,the daughter of Sammy. However in the all duration of film you would realise that director accomplished to show the intelligence of Isabelle especially. She is 12 year old, it has sense of space and it begins to understand the people, it is unprompted sometimes and perfunctory but I like a lot her character because he portrays a 12-year-old child without idealization. The film could be still better if they unfolded all them in bigger time and if the director didn't show to us immediately Tommy who was captive and he focused in relation between Grace and Sammy? Imagine how many big would be the contrast for the viewer who would have tied up Grace with Sammy and from the other it would feel pity for Tommy. Also Grace doesn't realizes rightly her role as a mother. She hears her girl say such a embarrassing thing to her father Tommy and she does not speak.I understand that she would preferred this thing and her:sleep with uncle Tommy because I consider the silence as acceptance. Of course is a other void that I realize is that Isabelle is sad because her dad leaves but in 2-month doesn't cry at all while she understands his absence? In general it was a very good film, the only disadvantage is the limited time. See it !!",Brothers

I'm not a fan of 3 hour movies, but I felt this should have been one. At 2 hours and change, it felt even a little rushed for me. It could have used 20 minutes more before Sam arrives back home to drive home the relationship and 40 minutes more after to delve deeper into the PTSD. More interaction with Tommy and Sam after Dam's homecoming could have helped also. It might have been perfect. The ending felt a little forced.

The trailers were very clever in making you think the story line was not what it actually is, no small task these days when they give almost everything away. I just couldn't wrap myself around the story...great subject matter, really good acting but it took forever to unlock the film's mentality. This is from the director of MY LEFT FOOT, IN America and other Oscar nominated films; I guess for me it JUST missed the mark and I really wanted to love it and came away thinking it was OK. Definitely a decent rental unless there's a list of movies your dying to see.",Brothers
166,decoconnor5,Fantastic portrayal of feeling and emotion......moving and shocking.,8,7 February 2010,"I was looking forward to seeing this film for some time and Toby Maguire put in his best performance to date with a portrayal that showed fantastic diversity. What made the performance so moving was that it was new ground for him. The Spiderman series limited Maguire and I didn't think he was capable of alternating his character with such force, I was very wrong.Jake Gyllenhaal was at his usual best and his career continues to flourish. I felt the relationship he had with his brother was very well developed and over the course of the film it continued to grow. It was his relationship with the family though that really proved moving. His developing of his character was superb and his ability to change the viewers mind is admirable.Natalie Portman did a solid job although I was a little disappointed by her imbalanced reactions at times. Special mention must go to Bailee Madison who at such a young age gave an outstanding performance as Maguires brutally honest daughter.This film will shine because of its two lead actors and every scene belonged to them. A shocking and moving film where human ethics and morales are put to the ultimate test with some devastating consequences.A strong statement by Maguire.",Brothers
167,pvtfridays31986,Not at all what I thought it would be,4,24 May 2010,"Okay first off I have to say I am an Army Wife so this movie is my version of the army's ""Hope for the best, plan for the worst"" I have to be able to watch stuff like this to get a feel for it, watch someone else ""go through it"" So one night, all alone I popped this in. I was crying pretty quickly into the movie. The thought of a husband dying overseas is devastating to me. Even if it's not mine. I could really feel for the character when she got the knock at the door cause I know what that fear is like. Now moving on. I could never ever ever ever ever see my soldier killing a fellow man to get home to me. Any of the guys I know, I just can't see it. It doesn't seem to ring true. Your brother is more important than you are in combat. Period. It's just weird to me. Not to mention if my soldier did kill someone to come home to me, would I want him back that way? Would I want the weird TOby McGuirre creeper thing. I don't know about this movie. It just felt off to me. And I think if I was a civilian...I wouldn't really life it.",Brothers
168,jgrizzle358,best drama of 2009,10,19 January 2010,"I chose to review this one first because I was so impressed after seeing it that I just had to. Now, this movie is a lot like A Perfect Getaway, in the sense that the trailer made it look a lot more like an action movie than it really was simply by showing the movie's final and best moments. However, that is no excuse not to see it, as it is one of the highlights of 2009. Many people have stated that 2009 has been the best year for movies we have had in a long time. And movies like Brothers, Avatar, Sherlock Holmes, Saw VI, Gamer and Law Abiding Citizen prove that. In the movie Sam (played by Tobey McGuire) is a marine home for awhile, who bails his good for nothing brother Tommy (Jake Gylenhall) out of jail. But when Sam's helicopter gets shot down in Afghanistan and he is captured and presumed dead Tommy steps in and plays the role of the man of the house. You can see where this is going...I loved Tobey in this movie as in every other movie he has always played the proper, nerdy kid, now he's playing the kick *** marine with anger issues. Tobey stated in an interview with Connan O'Brian ""I got so mad in that movie, that i actually scared myself when i went back to watch it."" and it's true. Tobey did a wonderful job and played the role of the pi**** off husband with flying colors. Jake also plays a great role and does his part nicely in the movie, playing a guy who's trying to set his life straight and stepping in to take care of his brother's kids when daddy can't be there. You'll find yourself wanting to take the side of one brother over the other but will be unable to due to the fact that both brothers have an equal amount of pros and cons that make them both just as likable or dis-likable throughout the entire movie. you will also feel sorry for both of them at many points.the thing i liked best about this movie was that it was 100% realistic. Nowadays you'll find so many movies that have realistic plots and ideas but the action is so far fetched. In this movie, every little thing down to the family dinner with 3 conversations going on at once during the youngest daughter's birthday is extremely realistic. If you haven't seen Brothers, you should, it is the best drama/suspense movie of the year.",Brothers
169,dermot23,great cast in particular Tobey Maguire is brilliant,8,9 January 2010,"caught this film last night and I have to say that I was blown away by the standard of acting in this highly emotional, heartbreaking and often touching film about relationships within a dysfunctional family who have been affected by warthe cast is what makes this film stand out, we all know Tobey Maguire from Spiderman, but we forget that this guy has real acting talent last seen in my opinion in 1999s the cider house rules. In this film he reminded me a lot of De Niro, in the way that he looked and his acting was also that good. he really got into the role to give a very real and powerful performance and in my opinion he deserves at least an Oscar nomination for this. I know hes already got a golden globe nomination which he totally deserves and at 34, he will certainly have plenty more opportunities for an Oscar in the futureanother young actor we all know by now is Jake Gyllenhaal, he too did a great job as the troubled brother just released from jail, actually you couldn't say that any actor in this movie were nothing less than perfect, not to mention the kids who were great, as in a lot of Jim Sheridan movies.Go see this if you enjoy watching actors on top of there game, although the story isn't very strong there's still a lot going on in this movie, a lot of very real issues on family relationships are touched on here and I think everyone will relate to something in this film.",Brothers
170,Hemo_jr,Two Unbelievable Plot Points,7,6 December 2009,"This is an excellent film flawed by two plot points that were simply impossible for me to swallow. First was something that the character, Sam Cahill, did. The second was something the character of his daughter, Isabelle, said. Neither rang true. Neither was made convincing by the narrative of the story. The movie was based upon another film - a Dutch one. Maybe an officer in the Dutch military would be more likely to do what the Sam Cahill character did in this film, but I doubt even that.If you get past these two items, I am sure you will enjoy the film. The acting is some of the best I've seen.",Brothers
171,darkteam_manu,"Powerful , Poignant, and Pressing.",8,22 December 2009,"Yes, Jim Sheridan has done it yet again. He has taken an adapted screenplay and brought it to life on screen using his great experience and talent for characterization. Brothers is one of the most powerful movies of the year, and it sat with me a long while after I exited the theater. I have to admit, I expected much from this film; Sheridan is great with his actors. After all, he did direct Daniel Day-Lewis and Brenda Fricker to Oscar glory in 1989 with ""My Left Foot"". Even the horrible 2005 gangster flick, ""Get Rich Or Die Trying'"" showed glimpses of great characterization (mostly though the role of Oscar-nominated Terrence Howard). When I saw that he had Tobey Maguire and Jake Gyllenhaal in this movie, two actors with great potential , I really got excited. And in the end, he didn't disappoint. The movie had parts that dragged on, and at times, I felt the plot could have been better developed, but the rest of the movie was really almost perfect. Some scenes made me as tense as I ever have been in a movie theater.However, hands down, the best portion of this movie was the acting. Maguire, Portman, and Gyllenhaal all delivered dynamite performances in this movie, but it was Maguire that really stood out. He wasn't too impressive in any of the Spider-Man movies, and I thought he was okay in Seabiscuit, but through his portrayal of Marine Captain Sam Cahill, he really proves to Hollywood that he is one heck of an actor. I felt his sorrow and pain, and I was traumatized by the reality of the psychological effects war can have, which is a theme that many movies have attempted to explore, but have failed in poignantly doing so.Gyllenhaal and Portman play vital roles in the movie as Sam's ex-con brother and wife respectively. After Cahill goes MIA, Gyllenhaal's character, Tommy Cahill, attempts to comfort his brother's wife who is having trouble adjusting to the reality of her husband's disappearance. The story moves back and forth between Sam's endeavors in Afghanistan and how Tommy attempts to comfort his wife, while he is gone. The performances delivered were truly powerful and pressed me to the verge of tears at times. The ending seemed a bit rushed, and I was hoping to see more of the characters interacting with each other, but nonetheless, as the credits rolled, I stayed glued to my seat for a couple of minutes, contemplating the rush of emotions I had felt throughout this very touching film. Jim Sheridan has had better constructed films, but none that involved more powerful characters. I will be very surprised if at least one of the three actors in this film do not get a nod come Oscars time.",Brothers
172,HonourableJudgeReinhold,"""Brothers""",9,1 March 2010,"The main trio of actors, Maguire, Portman and Gyllenhaal, are what really makes this film work. They each understand their role and what it requires of them. Sam is completely disturbed by what he has seen in imprisonment, Grace has to be accepting of her husband's change as she is concerned with what her children are going through and Tommy cares for his brother, but obviously has feelings for Grace. This love triangle is the main cause of conflict in the film. Sam, after returning from Afghanistan, is dramatically changed. He has forgotten how to live his life, and the love from the family steadily decreases. The film asks its characters questions that are very difficult to answer, with every character facing an event that completely changes their life, whether for better or worse. My only complaint about the film is that the writing gets a little bit weak sometimes. The film attempts to be a completely convincing character examination, but some of the dialogue does not really seem to fit, especially with scenes involving the children. Nevertheless, its situations are mature and powerful, and the performances craft the film to create scenes that are truly effective.",Brothers

The brother, instead of answering a straightforward question as fast and as understable as he can, proceeds to stare ackwardly at his brother, sigh, laugh and again and again ask him about his mental well being.

174,devon_bolen,Tobey Maguire Can Act!!,7,1 September 2021,"An American remake of the Danish film of the same name. Brothers follows Capt. Sam Cahill (Tobey Maguire) who welcomes home his brother Tommy (Jake Gylenhaal) after serving time in prison for a bank robbery years prior. After leaving for his 2nd tour of duty in Afghanistan, Sam's helicopter is shot down and he is presumed dead. Upon the news of his brothers death Tommy steps in to aid his brother's grieving widow Grace (Natalie Portman) and help care for his two kids who are left fatherless.The film wastes no time in revealing that Capt. Cahill is not dead but rather being held as a prisoner of war and tortured by enemy militia. After being forced to commit unspeakable atrocities in order to survive, Sam is eventually rescued and abruptly thrust back into his old life.The premise is undoubtedly engaging, however Brothers is the perfect example of a film who's performances elevate the script. While it's message is a powerful one, it becomes bogged down by a lot of writing choices that just don't feel believable. While it succeeds at effectively building tension this is often at the expense of logic. Which makes Brothers a frustrating film at times.It's examination of the effect war has on a soldier's psyche is thought provoking and in that respect it mostly succeeds. Largely due to a phenomenal performance by Tobey Maguire. His nuanced portrayal of a man pushed beyond his limits & struggling with the mental consequences of the choices he's made is truly stirring. He's a paranoid broken shell of his former self, plunged back into a life he thought was over and clinging to a secret that's tearing him apart. If you've only seen Tobey as Spider-Man his acting in this will blow you away.Jake Gylenhaal's fantastic as always. Tommy is a man who has been living in his brothers shadow his whole life, as the film constantly reminds us. His own insecurities are only amplified by their alcoholic father (Sam Shepard) who's favorite pastime is demeaning and comparing him to his brother. Despite this Tommy clearly has deep affection for his brother. Natalie Portman also shows incredible range. From grieving widow, to a fractured woman desperate to help her husband who she can feel is suffering. Despite the bravado he hides behind.While far from perfect in its execution, Brothers succeeds as a contemplative look at the ramifications war has on veterans and the barrage of mental health issues it incites. With an exceptional final act, Brothers is worth watching for the performances alone. Even if the central narrative becomes a little muddled along the way.",Brothers

All around great performances by all of the cast(Tobey Maguire especially, probably one of the best in his career) and a surprisingly good performance by Jake Gyllenhall, as brother of Tobey Maguire(good casting on that, they could actually be twins!). That's one strong suit of this movie, good casting...great as a matter of fact. Natilie Portman playing a traditional army wife, a very accurate portrayal. Let me say that this movie wasn't what I was expecting to say the least. Is that a good thing? Somewhat yes. This movie is a realistic portrayal of an army run family, but I thought it came up in the end, a little weak. The ending is probably what you're not expecting(I knew it took me off-guard), but I thought it could've been better. Realistic, but a little disappointing.

Even though there is not one recorded case in U.S. military history of a captured U.S. soldier murdering a fellow soldier at the behest of his captors, you'll love to see it happen in this movie. You'll just swoon at the totally unbelievability of it all. You'll be thrilled to watch a situation in which the U.S. military apparently declares soldiers dead after a helicopter crash in a war zone without dead bodies or even bothering to initially declare the soldiers MIA. It helps the story to go straight to ""dead,"" so to heck with any attempt at realism.

178,csneely-1,A chilling look at the mental toll of war,9,15 February 2010,"We both thought this was a reasonably well done movie about the war effort 'over there'. Toby Maguire was an intense officer and the quintessential good son. He made his daddy proud. Then there was the other son Jake Gyllenhall.........a bad boy recently out of prison. He made his daddy angry. Sam Shepard portrayed a believable old Jarhead kind of dad. The dynamics in the family were interesting to follow (though predictable). Anybody who grew up in a military family will recognize some of these behaviors; they resonate with army/navy brats. To me the mark of a good movie goes beyond simple entertainment. Are the the themes portrayed thought provoking after you leave the theater? Comedies and ""fluff"" movies are excused from making you think!",Brothers
179,blazquez-frank-3648,"Nothing special about this...A family drama 2009 version of ""Jar-Head"" --lazily written script",5,12 January 2010,"Tobey Maguire is not an actor who can play a marine. Maybe down the road in his career he could be prepared, but once I heard him screaming in the kitchen like a high pitched 8 year old girl, that was it for me--it was more annoying than what Sheridan was trying to portray as a genuine mental breakdown!The only good parts about this movie is when you are in suspense about what is going to happen to Capt. Cahill and his marine. Other than that, it was too much of a Bi-Polar switch from horrific terror scenes to boring at-home life with Jake Gyllenhaal and Natalie Portman.The arguments Tommy had with this father were way too dramatic and unbelievable-- Yes I know some people argue like that with family members, but come on! the background given to us on the family life would NOT lead us to believe a father could talk to his son in such a way. Reminded me of the dad trying to be like Robert DeNiro from ""This boys life"" and failing horribly. Whats up with the ending? He just somehow goes to a mental hospital for attempted murder? Even a hero at his caliber would still be prosecuted in our courts for wielding around a gun and shooting off rounds--no matter how much of a war hero he was.Maybe this movie was made as a little present to marines that are home right now to connect with something.---Natalie Portman looks like a pro when she takes a drag off that joint. ---Very Random how Jake Gyllenhaal brings home that random woman from a bar then we never see or hear of her again in the movie...talk about a minor roll huh? like a awkward position of someone being a cross between an ""extra"" and an ""actor"". We never even got a little background scene of why he brought her (yes we know it was probably to show Tommy was trying to alleviate tension)--that was too easy to put in a script.Bottom Line: Elementary Script--We can easily tell where the script got lazy...And we will probably never hear about Benioff in major productions again,since he blew it with this one.",Brothers

He is really really good , they way Jake walks and talks and reacts is very good, you feel like he is just came out of prison , look at him in the first dinner scene , the way he holds a fork is just amazing.Toby Maguire deserved much more recognition for this movie , he delivered.There is one thing I have to say about MAKE UP of this movie , it is fascinating and it helps performances a lot, the way they changed Toby which is very subtle and not noticeable to an untrained eye it is just beautiful and you have no idea how much it helps to sell the image and even the performance.Natalie Portman is really perfect when she goes emotional but when she is working with kids and talks to them the chemistry is not there.I can say this is a very good movie because it takes you in really quickly , has a great rhythm and Performances are really amazing.

Although not so much a fan of Tobey Maguire, I was actually surprised at his role in this movie, and the strength he gives to his character, so in the sense of character portrayal Tobey did quite a realistic and natural approach to someone who has been through a traumatic experience.The movie tells the story of a family which is broken when Tobey Maguire's character has an accident in Afghanistan, and as far as story goes, the movie can be pretty much understood by just watching the trailer, as there is as much content in the trailer, as there is in the film. You can observe some character development with Jake Gyllenhaal's character, but thats pretty much i. I was disgusted at how Natalie Portman is always on the background, not really doing anything in the entire film, I am used to see her in strong roles, in which she usually takes leadership inside the film, and in this film she has a weak weak role.Overall the movie lacks in content, and it would have been nice to see some of the things that would happen to the characters in the future, but nonetheless the actors make this movie better than it really is.",Brothers

Today you are even more hated in those countries and because of that the danger of terrorism is higher today.After 911 better solution would have been to secure your own country so any enemies could not attack your country.Those lost soldiers would still be alive and only fragment of that money been used that have been used in these wars.Attack is not heroism, defending your own country is more noble task.The longer this war is going to go the less heroes there will be.

I recall movies like A Perfect Murder, The Gift, and Seven being a few stand-outs from years past. Never building anything convincing, this movie was out of pace due to a heap of predictable montage scenes that conclude in a lackluster finish.

It might have worked better had we been kept completely in the dark as to the soldier's fate, to be put in the same position as the wife and brother. As it is we are simply sitting waiting for his inevitable (rather than hoped-for) return and we know any emotional investment during this buildup will be wasted.

Broken and ridden with guilt over his actions while there, despite the fact he had no choice.In the same time, the younger brother develops into a supportive and strong character who confronts his guilt and tackles it head on.The acting is first class, both from the main characters (the brothers) and also from the supporting actors.It was great to finally see a film that touches the modern conflicts without becoming either a pro war rhetoric or an anti-war forces bash.

196,samrim-1,a perfect ensemble piece,10,8 July 2010,"I've just watched this film, for the first time; it was almost too powerful to bear. I'll write more on the subject later, but just had to express my shock and amazement. Others have praised it (and otherwise- I've just had a quick look), but it's years since I've seen as gripping a story. I thought the appearance of the film first rate, the war scenes realistic and morally sound, the story involving, and the acting (especially) perfect. I'll single no one out, it was a perfect ensemble piece.Turning young men into killing machines, sending them into nightmare situations, then expecting those who survive to return seamlessly to what went before, is unrealistic in the extreme, as this story so graphically shows.I say I watched it for the 'first time', whether I can bear to be rung out again remains to be seen, even for the superb acting.A wonderful, worthwhile, film. John Wayne must be spinning, bless him, in his grave.Best Wishes Sam ""Jack leaned against the steady heartbeat""",Brothers
197,sotosyo,A small recap.,7,1 July 2019,"An overall decent movie that had its flaws and could be alot better, eventhough this almost 2 houred movie passed relatively quick it had some major issues, 1 hour in and you dont really get the point, you have the main protagonist Sam who at the begining and for the most part of the movie has very little screen time which is not necessarily a bad thing BUT its really confusing to clrea things out on what kind of movie is it, is it a war story? or is it one of those were the marine dies and it focuses on the family and how life keeps going on no matter what? For my opinion they should either show much more of the hole hostage thing or just cut him off entirely from the movie. Strong perfomances made this a good? movie in the end.",Brothers

Brothers is every bit Oscar worthy it contains everything in a movie that is special. Every performance is stellar, most notably Tobey Maguire and while I'm sure multiple people are saying this I'm not just agreeing with them. Tobey has always had the potential to give a great performance he just hasn't had a role that would allow him to show his talent until now. With costars like Natalie Portman, Jake Gyllenhaal, and Sam Shepard it's hard to stand out, but Tobey does. Brothers is more than worth seeing and I won't be surprised when the Oscars honor it with multiple nominations.",Brothers
200,imdbmikedub,Boring,5,14 April 2010,"The triangular relationship between the two brothers, played by Tobey Maguire and Jake Gyllenhaal, and the wife, played by Natalie Portman, is about as dramatic as a wet rag.Overall, I suspect that the fault lies in the choice of Tobey Maguire. He does have a few moments where he lets rip, emotionally, and it's nice to see. In general, though, he's quite a flat actor and sucks the drama, tension, and feeling out of the movie. Consequently, the climax comes across as more of an whimper than a bang.Somehow, both Jake Gyllenhaal and Natalia Portman seem restricted as both have far more range than they show here.If this movie is about that relationship, and about PTSD, it is a let down on both fronts. Which is a real shame on the latter because of the importance of the issue as troops arrive back to the USA and elsewhere from war.",Brothers
201,scarmpls,"A passionate non-political, pertinent, family drama whose plot involves a war",8,25 March 2010,"I am thankful for this opportunity to share my thoughts and feelings about this film. This is my first time reviewing a film. I will do my utmost to be honest, and to be true to the form of art critique.There is only ONE film that I have seen where, after watching it one or more times, I cannot think of anything I would have changed. Brothers is not that film. The important thing about Brothers is that I cared enough about it to dwell, to re-watch certain scenes, and to imagine-just to be sure that I didn't miss something that would have added it to my list of one.I don't want to get into what that certain something is, that I would change about the film. I would not want to dissuade anyone from watching this beautiful portrayal of family, conflict, manhood, and pain.The plot-line of the film is this. A young Marine, father of two daughters, married to his high school sweetheart, and pride of the family, picks up his wayward brother from prison. At the same time, the young Marine is preparing to go to war for a repeat tour of duty. The brothers' father and step-mother join the Marine's family, and his brother, for dinner to...wish the one a safe journey, and ""acknowledge"" the return of the wayward one. The father clearly displays pride in the one son, and disappointment in the other. The step-mother and the Marine's wife try to remain as neutral as possible. The girls, as children usually are, are curious and non-judgmental.It is within this dynamic, realistic, family structure that the relationship between the two brothers plays out. What will happen when the Marine goes to war? How will the wayward brother adapt to life outside bars? How will the wife and the girls deal with the absence of the Marine? Will the brothers' love for each other fade or be ruled over by their father, or will it grow stronger somehow? Is there something intrinsic in the love between two brothers that penetrates and lasts-through bars and concrete walls, across years and across thousands of miles to the point of where the two men can barely recognize themselves? The artists that bring us, Brothers, thought this question an important question to ask. I feel that they portrayed their answer in a powerful and creative way.",Brothers
202,bumblemuk,"This movie is completely unbelievable, inaccurate TRASH.",1,21 January 2011,"Personally I saw almost no change in his demeanor and acting from before to after his capture. He is an automaton throughout the entire film. In the beginning, when you expect to see him in the happy dad/proud officer role, he stands there as stiff as a totem pole and squeaks like an insecure 10-year-old and you have to wonder: how does this guy have two girls when he's obviously never even been laid? When the film puts that kind of question into your mind ten minutes in, you know it's gonna be bad.The interior of the film was complete nonsensical trash. Apparently the United States military just lists everyone in the area dead the moment a bullet is fired or a vehicle crashes in Afghanistan. Bodies? Nah. Confirmation? Nah. Search effort? Nah. Can't have any of that that. It would keep us away from getting to that cliché'd minister and officer in uniform scene at the pretty lady's front door. This is how the US military operates in this film: GRUNT: ""Sir, a helicopter went down.""OFFICER: *spills coffee, craps himself* ""Get to the wife's place IMMEDIATELY and tell her everyone is DEAD!"" GRUNT: ""But sir! We need to investigate, secure and examine the crash site, check for bodies and confirm KIA and--!""OFFICER: ""Damn it, son, THIS IS WAR! Not one of those fancy TV shows where they 'investigate' things!"" And finally, for all of Tobey's wooden and uninspired acting trying to do the ""Don't tell them ANYTHING, private"" crap, wow he sure turned around for the sensationalistic BULLSH-- scene of him MURDERING his fellow captive because some raghead pointed a gun at him. Seriously. SERIOUSLY?! That scene was insult not only to every single member of our armed forces, but to every soldier, sailor, marine or airman who has spent any time at all in captivity on hostile soil. An INSULT.They tried to present it as poor Tobey, he only has two choices: kill his fellow marine with an iron pipe, or they cut off said marine's head. Obviously not a very grand set of options.But you know what a marine would have done, if he were a true Marine, officer or enlisted, private or general? He would have seen the THIRD option: attack your captors with that iron pipe and die fighting. At the instant of a swing from his captain, that private would have risen to his feet and made every savage effort to kill as many as possible. Would they have gotten free? Absolutely not. But would they have been forced to kill one another or be forced to kneel down while their head gets sawed off? No. They would have been taken down with small arms and died rather quickly in comparison to the other options. But when those ARE the only options, a true Marine would have executed exactly that. There is no 'good' option, only one where you can limit the scale of how badly your life might end. That scene was utterly deplorable, unrealistic, a travesty and an insult.And then Cahill came home and thought wifey was banging brother. Honestly, I wish she was. I enjoyed watching Gyllenhall and Portman interact, it seemed sincere and Tommy's arc through the movie was characteristic of his acting ability, which is top-notch in my opinion. I was always disappointed when Totem-Pole Maguire would show up and ruin the scene.In the end, his character should have been charged with capital murder.I won't even go on with the rest of the film because there's seriously nothing worth mentioning. It was just filler material for a 100-minute timespan.Don't buy, rent-- hell don't even bother seeing this movie for free. It's completely unbelievable and inaccurate trash.",Brothers

210,sclark-41,Did anyone know that Tobey could act?,10,12 December 2009,"What drew me to this movie was the cast of Jake Gyllenhaal and Natalie Portman, two phenomenal actors in their own regards. The only expectation that I had going into see this film was that I would be unimpressed by Tobey Maguire. Having seen him in several films (including Spider-Man), I must say that I wasn't prepared for the incredible performance he provided.This movie was very simplistic. Nothing flashy, no real special effects, small amounts of simple guitar music as a soundtrack. But it conveyed a whole roller coaster of emotions from the beginning. The growth of Jake Gyllenhaal's character, the anguish displayed by Natalie Portman, the palpable pain and suffering by Tobey Maguire, and the fear and anger displayed by the eight-year-old Bailee Madison all combine for a very gripping tale.Many regard this movie as anti-war. I simply do not see it as such. Soldiers are praised for their heroism on the battlefield (which they completely deserve), but all too often the wounds they suffer physically and mentally are disregarded. This movie illustrates the very real problem of the mental health of our service men and women, and the problems it causes in family dynamics.",Brothers

212,sunnyornsam,"Movie was great, could use some accuracy.",5,9 August 2021,"Story was great. As a service member, PTSD is a real thing and it could affect everything including your family. The only thing that bothers me is the inaccuracy of the Marine Corps & the military overall portrayed in the movie. You had a guy named James D Dever, who served 25 years in the Marine Corps. It looked like he didn't do much advising as he did in Clint Eastwood movies. Why are people walking outdoors in uniform without a cover, and why are people going indoors with a cover on? Why is a Major following a captain in parade rest? What kinda bothered me was that in MCRD, within those 13 weeks, they trained you to jump 60 feet from a platform into a pool and how to survive in water. Why did they fall into a lake without a weapon? Why wasn't their weapon within arms reach or on their persons? Accountability is a big thing in the military, you should always have your weapons with you, or within arms reach. So if situations like this were to ever happened, you could defend yourself before getting captured. When you make movies about Marines or any branch of service, there should be a standard that needs to be upheld in accordance to the Marine Corps.",Brothers

I come from a quasi-military family, but even if the viewer isn't exactly from a military background, I think the directer does a good job of capturing the essence of it and making the emotional bonds between the characters and the viewer. You not only get to see what the family goes through before and after Sam is found to be alive, but you also see what Sam goes through while he's a prisoner of war. I would have liked if Grace was bit more assertive instead of just dealing with the circumstances as they happened. If she would have confronted her husband or asked someone for help before things got out of hand, then that would have made the difference between what happened, and something not so dramatic...but probably wouldn't have made much of a movie.",Brothers

215,esotericpoet04,"Compassionate, Well Acted, Believable",8,9 May 2010,"Last weekend I watch the movie Brothers with a friend of mine. Even though I saw Brothers in the theater, watching it the second time was still just as tense and compelling. The three main stars in Brothers are Natalie Portman, Tobey Maguire, and Jake Gyllenhaal, who make an excellent trio. Portman and Maguire play a married couple who were high school sweet hearts and have two daughters. Gyllenhaal is the irresponsible brother who is just released from prison and has a past with his father, played by Sam Shepard.The movie opens up with a portrayal of Maguire and Portman living the happy life they have always wanted with their two daughters in a suburban neighborhood. Maguire plays a Captain in the Marines who about to leave for another tour in Afghanistan while Gyllenhaal is released from prison. While on his tour, Maguire's crew encounters an insurgent attack leaving all but him and one private dead and were ultimately captured. During their captivity, both were severely tortured and starved giving the viewer a feeling of intense emotion. After months of continuous torture, Maguire is left with a choice that will ultimately affect his entire life.Meanwhile, Portman receives the news that her husband was killed during a mission and at times questions if it's really true because she doesn't feel that it is true. During the funeral, the father has an influx of emotions that leads to him lashing out at Gyllenhaal. Things between father and son stay tense for a while until Gyllenhaal steps up for Portman and his nieces to be a father figure and fix up the kitchen in her house. The two become close and end up sharing a very passionate kiss. Realizing that the kiss was wrong, Portman tried to keep her distance.After several months of torture, Maguire is found by his fellow Marines during a raid and his returned home. But once he is home, things are noticeably different with his family and his brother. Shutting himself out from his wife, he grows suspicious of the relationship between Portman and Gyllenhaal. This suspicious leads to a very emotional break down for the entire family, which I think is the best part of the movie.I must say that I thoroughly enjoyed watching this movie. I loved every minute of it. It was very deep, intense and the acting was well beyond exceptional. The drama and humor correctly flowed throughout the movie, not overwhelming the audience with too much intense emotion. However, the parts that were intense were directed very well and believable. As great as this movie is, I was very disappointed at the ending. I believe that the ending could have been a little more in-depth. It just feels like a cliff hanger, leaving me guessing what was going to happen next.All in all I would say this movie is worth picking up or renting. I would love to see these three together again.esotericpoet.wordpress.com",Brothers
216,alex-beauchesne,"Brothers is deep in character, plot, acting, and just plain amazing!",10,29 March 2010,"I have just finished a viewing of ""Brothers"", and boy, this beats out any movie done in the recent years. Lately I've been finding myself disappointed in films that have been badly casted, underdone or overdone, bad writing or failure to achieve the maximum potential had they worked just that little extra.With ""Brothers"", there is nothing lacking! The characters are well-thought out, and each is written with a specific multi-faceted personality in mind. Jake Gyllenhaal, Tobey Maguire, and especially, my new favourite child actress Bailee Madison. Look out for this one, she played a 9-year-old girl (I'm guessing the age), yet she was very intelligent, and had a jealousy of her smaller sister for getting all the things she never got or never gets, which I'm sure many older siblings can relate to that. She plays it beautifully and with so much emotion. Jake Gyllenhaal comes across as an actual idiot who barely grazed high school and landed himself in jail, and does it with such precision you'd think he always has been this character this whole life. And Tobey Maguire makes the best performance of his life that will certainly push himself substantially as the cute nerd next door who moonlights as an arachnoid superhero.If you find yourself in your local video rental store and are looking for an amazing film that will fill you with awe and that has a superb and completely raw feel, pick this up, go to the front desk, and while you're there pick up some tissues.",Brothers
217,agbwon2,Insulting above all else,1,5 December 2009,"As a Captain in the United States who has served in both Afghanistan and Iraq I found this movie to be sickening and unrealistic to be remade in U.S. Marine uniforms. No other foreign Army or military service can rival our U.S. Marines. Making this film is all to pretentious of the director and sending the WRONG message to the viewers. I was so insulted by the scene in which Toby Maguire beat a fellow Marine to death with a lead pipe while at gun point. This was at or around four months after they were captured and sold to a Taliban like terrorist cell. My eyes did not believe what they saw and I got up and walked right out of the Theatre.Immediately upon captivity I found his disdain and treatment of his fellow POW to be unprofessional and inhumane. His psychological approach and separation from family and friends is appropriate and remaining a leader while captured is a must but his condescending nature in the use of the word ""Private"" and no sort of mental or spiritual guidance made him look like a horrible leader and human being. You could tell thought he was superior than his fellow Marine who was in the same exact hell he was in. His behavior was altruistic and insidious.Natalie Portman was her usual amazing self; she is an excellent actress and played the grieving spouse role with superb accuracy. Although most ex cons are not as good looking and charming as Jake Gyellenhal, I found his attempt at redemption through the first 45 minutes as sincere and heartfelt. This phemomenom of a brother, a best friend or another Soldier filling the role of the fallen soldier is a common occurrence. However, is it the right thing to do? The movie industry is so knowledgeable on everything and these Hollywood types live in a dream world.If Hollywood did a real movie about Soldiers, Infidelity and the horrors of combat it would be all to real and harrowing. Making it less marketable simply because of the frequency behind it and the damage it has caused to so many veterans.Toby Maguire as an artist or actor; better yet American should have really considered whether or not this role was a wise decision. What was his motive for this role? I hope he is grateful to the United States Marine Corps and every other Veteran who has served in order for him to have the ability and the freedom to live in a country like ours. It is the Land of the free and the home of the brave. Our Bill of Rights has been preserved by those who know of true sacrifice. What sacrifice will he make?",Brothers
218,wadofmeat,Boring and predictable.,4,9 January 2010,"Acting: 4/10 The cast of ""Brothers"" can be called respectable; especially for an independent film. Toby Maguire played the role of Sam Cahill very well. Throughout the entire movie, he proved to be quite capable of captivating the audience and moving them along with him to fully understand the progression of his characters thoughts and emotions. That being said, I feel that the performance of most of the other characters did not benefit the movie as much as they could have, or especially not nearly enough as Maguire's performance. The performance of Natalie Portman was not very good. It may be a little off to say that she over-acted her part as Grace Cahill, but her performance repeatedly pushed me out of the movie. All of her actions were visibly forced and unnatural; almost insincere-- as though the director was giving her too much direction. Although she may have acted with every inch of her body and did exactly what the script called for, it never truly felt as though she actually WAS Grace Cahill, wife of Sam and mother of two.. but just some actress, performing a role, listening to a director, and recalling a script. Lastly, Taylor Geare and Bailee Madison as the two daughters. Again, their performances seemed fake, as though they had too much input from the director; but then again, they're only kids. Children and acting don't often mix well.Storyline: 4/10 The story itself was good-- it was not new and revolutionizing, nor played out and repetitive. It was a solid story just faulted by slow and predictable progression, though not unexpected from an independent film. I am not denying that every scene may have been beneficial to the story of the movie.. but if the entire movie was reduced into a 20-30 minute short, containing no more than tightened dialogue and an identical climax, it would have had the same impact (if not more for elimination the boredom factor) as this 100+ minute version.Overall: 4/10 I would not recommend.",Brothers

Tobey manages to change his characters personality perfectly after dramatically being affected by the murder of his fellow soldier. all the scenes throughout the film are believable and are rarely boring, the family is portrayed excellently by the cast.The danish 2004 original of brothers was low budget but very believable there are scenes within that film that are not changed in the 2009 version for instance the ice skating scenes and the trashing of the kitchen. in my opinion Jake Gyllenhaal plays the uncle role a lot better than in the first version and this adds to the end emotion of the film, you will get attached to the characters and feel sorry for all of them at the end of the film.it is a ""hard hitting"" film with ""powerful"" performances by the entire cast,",Brothers

From the acting to the directing, even the scriptwriting, it was all superb!The story of the film is pretty straight forward to understand and doesn't take a long time to get to grips with the characters. Tobey Maguire really out did himself in this film. Making up for that awful dance down the street in Spider-Man 3!!! His character 'Sam' is a captain going out to Afghanistan for a new tour of duty. His wife Grace, played by the very talented Natalie Portman, must come to terms with her husband leaving her at home with their two daughters. However, before Sam moves out, his rebellious younger brother Tommy, played by Jake Gyllenhaal, is released from prison and begins to adjust to his family. Once Sam is away Tommy becomes more friendly with the family and finds happiness at last. However, not all is at peace, whilst Sam is flying in a helicopter, he is shot down and Grace is given the bad news.Brothers was hands down, a truly brilliant film, and without giving too much away, the overall storyline is VERY clever.THE PRO's: - The cast give a stunning performance. - A very moving and heart wrenching storyline. - Memorable scenes.THE CON's: - Not long enough! =DAll in all, for a film that lasts a good hour and three-quarters, it was very powerful and is a must see for anyone who wishes to know what life is like for a soldier's family, back home.********* (9 Stars)",Brothers

The movie starts off with this wonderful military family where the man of the house has been deployed to Afghanistan. Somewhere within the midst of the movie he becomes a POW and everyone believes he is dead. Back at home in the US he has a family of a young wife and two very beautiful daughters. He also still has his father around as well as an older brother. As the movie progresses the woman's husband is reported to her as KIA and she tells his brother and the whole family. Instead of his brother abandoning his little brothers family he steps up and decides to help.Somewhere in the midst of taking care of the family for his brother he falls in love with the woman and the two starts a life together. She does this because she believes she is a widow now and does not want to spend the rest of her life alone or with some man that the children do not know. Things go real well and the brother is able to take care of the kids and the wife. Then one day she gets a call from the military and they tell her that her husband has been rescued and is alive and that they made a mistake by telling her he was dead.

Sure in 'Pearl' it wasn't 2 biological brothers but the lifelong best friends from childhood who were raised as brothers, and one wasn't getting out of prison while the other was in the military but one was serving in England while the other was left to sit on a beach in Hawaii's Naval Yard.In both cases the one who went off to fight, leaving the other guy behind; gets reported by the US Military as dead and the widow/grieving fiancé in her remorse and deep loss seeks comfort and solace with the brother/best friend raised as a brother who remains.In 'Pearl', as in 'Brothers', the once presumed dead guy miraculously arrives claiming ""only the thoughts of YOU kept me alive"" (to the woman) and physical violence ensues when the fact she's bedding down with the brother/guy raised as the brother is found out.How typical of Hollywood. Not only did it try to hijack a Danish film almost scene for scene, but it forgot that one of their own 2001 Oscar winners (Sound Editing - but still an Oscar)was in all likelihood what the Danish stole their 2004 script from. It reminds me of the Movie of Coco Chanel's life story that was done in France and quickly hijacked by America and released as a Made For TV Movie starring Shirley MacLean just weeks before the French film made its way to American theaters. Shame on Hollywood for stealing so many existing films and getting away with it, although both ""Deep Impact"" and ""Armageddon"" were about the exact same thing and came out the exact same year; as were Pierce Brosnan's ""Dantes Peak"" and Tommy Lee Jones' ""Volcano"" and nobody seemed to even notice.Tisk...tisk...tisk.Goes to prove there's not a single original thought left in the Mega Studio consortium of Hollywood.By the way... what's the next comic book that will be made (or should I say RE-made) in film format? What TV series from the 70's will be the next box office bomb unleashed on us? And how many old movies are we going to see ""reworked"" with a new cast and released as something new and fresh when clearly its just... ""what used to be""? What a CRAP premise for a film.Its been done by much more popular actors not even 10 years ago and yet... nobody else seems to care. Oh yes... I smell something, but it's definitely NOT an Oscar. How can it be? The piece they lifted this story from wasn't even nominated for Best Picture, and it was INCREDIBLE!",Brothers
225,scooter_d,Reality,10,7 December 2009,"After reading several of the recent votes for this film, I've realized that most of the viewers see this more of an entertainment piece and have not absorbed the message. Having been a witness to the actions that Sam displayed on screen these are incredibly accurate, to the perfect alignment and position to the glasses and mugs in the new kitchen, the gun drawn when the dog was barking outside, the smashing of the kitchen, the anger and paranoia (of Tommy and his wife and the anger and belligerence with the police). Even the self-abuse when Sam was hitting himself out of frustration. We noticed at the dinner table when he first arrived home that he didn't have the humor he once possessed when his daughter was relating the dog and the elephant. He never wanted to hurt anyone but was still holding the fire poker because a side of him probably wanted to kill everyone who was in his way and also when he put the gun to his head. Tommy and Sam say throughout the film ""you're my brother"" because the writer wanted to emphasize that Sam still has the human attachment to people but is now withdrawn because of his experiences. I only hope that more people will see that this is how too many of our servicemen and woman are coming home to. This was a remarkable, emotional, and realistic to what really happens.",Brothers
226,madjoy88,O Brothers You Are Thou ...,10,9 December 2009,"What a memorable movie ... I was in tears over half the time but very much enjoyed it. The story was skillfully adapted from the original. The acting was top notch. Tobey Maguire really surprised me with how deep he dug emotionally in this. I heard he did a lot of preparation with real soldiers and such. Natalie was very strong as the wife / mother holding it all together through the trauma of the situation. Jake Gyllenhaal was fantastic and lovable as always, even as the ex-con turned good guy. I especially liked the daughter Isabelle played by Bailee Madison. She's very in tune and a skillful young talent. The direction was strong as expected by Jim Sheridan, I love all of his films. Oscars are definitely in tact.",Brothers
227,pt-605-198625,Yet another copy of a Dnish film,5,11 December 2009,"Honestly, sometimes it's just better watching the original with sub-titles. The film is a US version of a Danish film called the same. While the actors and script run pretty true, the realism seems to be lost in this American version, while the original Danish version seemed to keep me grounded to the reality of it all. Sometimes larger budgets really don't produce better results. It seems to me that the Hollywood set have started running out of ideas for films, and have simply started creating US versions of successful foreign films, REC, Nattevagten, and now Brødre, all seem to be taken into the US movie grinder, and more often than not, they loose the originality of the original film. Worth see as the story itself is very good, but in all honesty, I recommend seeing the original.",Brothers
228,arne-roesch,Another ripoff,5,18 December 2009,"Well if you did like this movie you might want to watch the original, since this is just a copy of a movie from like 5 years ago :) And the original is MUCH MUCH better, get a dozen more awards etc, and has actors who are actually able to truly convey some emotions !! http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0386342/ Funny how Americans always have to remake successful 'foreign' movies, which usually turn out worse than the original...and why, too lazy to read subtitles ? Anyway go watch the original, since that one truly is a brilliant movie which cannot be outperformed but such a pitiful copy ! And it's with : Connie Nielsen from gladiator :)",Brothers
229,InMediasRes,all-American cliché at its finest,6,22 December 2009,"Have you ever watched a new film and felt as if you've seen it replayed over, and over, and over again except in a different era?Coming into this movie completely oblivious to its existence, since it was a quick decision after ""Avatar"" was sold out, I was surprised to find that this film had both Maguire and Portman in it, both top-notch choices. However, if it weren't for the precise execution of the script, this film would have fallen flat, forgotten, and collecting dust on a shelf with the rest of the 'soldier comes home and isn't the same ever again' motif films.Having said that, the first half of the film was fantastic. Benioff's subtle humour and slow character development made our characters personal, the Cahill family could be any American family, mind you... if your family is perfect with the exception of the unloved brother (think Everybody Loves Raymond). We grieved for Grace when she lost her husband, we saw the sadness in her children's eyes, we even fell in love with Tommy for being a bad boy... and then something went desperately wrong. What should have been the climax of this film left us feeling as if time had stopped, and indeed, it did. Instead of feeling joy that the protagonist has made it home, every moment of this film makes us feel anguish that Grace has to deal with him, and the children, (whom, by the way, started getting on my nerves by the birthday scene). Portman's performance was consistent through out, as was Gyllenhaal, who I found myself having more sympathy for. By the time the psychologically and emotionally impaired soldier finally snaps, the acting becomes almost laughable on Maguire's part, and hardly worth taking seriously. When this far-too-long clichéd saga was over, we could finally finally breath, and rest knowing that no, grace didn't really have an affair when she should have, Sam didn't kill himself when he had been a ticking time-bomb for over an hour, Tommy still got the short end of the stick, and the little girls clearly had some unresolved jealously issues.Was it absolutely horrible? No. Was it a masterpiece? No. Would I watch it again? No.",Brothers
230,AmitDayal,"Strong, immaculate performances. It's hard to ignore such gruesome reality.",7,20 March 2010,"To be honest, what drew me to this movie was the explosive casting of Tobey Maguire and Jake Gyllenhal together on screen. I expected another cliché of a war movie (not that don't like them), with an insane body count. What I did not expect was, a truly harsh movie based on the everyday lives of families who's loved ones go out to war, uncertain of their future.For me Tobey Maguire delivers the performance of his lifetime, till now at least. He has gotten so strong as an actor, that he executes every scene with divine perfection. Having a deep character sketch is always helpful, but delivering it is a whole other ball game.Jake Gyllenhal plays Maguire's brother, and his transformation in the movie is more than impressive. He packs a punch with his volatile act as an ex-con. Yet his broken relationship with his father doesn't fail to make you reminisce on your own.Natalie Portman has matured as an actress with every movie. Her role as Maguire's wife is very convincing. I just wish she had more script on her side to play with.A special mention has to be made for the 10 year old Bailee Madison, elder of the two young daughters of Tobey Mcguire's in the movie. She delivers some very heart warming scenes in the movie.The screenplay for me was very nicely built. Some transitions in the movie were very risky, but cleverly stitched. The director made a smart choice of staying away from the gore aspect of war. But that doesn't mean some scenes won't make you cringe in your seats.All in all, I think it was an important film to be made considering the present state of affairs, and should be seen by everybody.",Brothers
231,obedient_69-641-938667,Thi movie is a very bad copy of the original,1,21 January 2010,"Go and see the original Danish movie. Jim Sheridan has ripped this movie to bits and destroyed it. It doesn't need the Hollywood ending! This awful version of Brothers (Mr Sheridan didn't even bother changing the title) is a water down movie wonderland of the original gripping drama. The characters become unbelievable and over the top. Whilst some of the original storyline has been kept, some very important parts are removed. The original movie focuses on the horror of war, of family life while a soldier is away and comes back. It does not focus on which side is the ""good side"" and who is ""the bad side"" and the ""glory"" of war. (unlike Mr Sheridans) He really has missed the main point of the movie.Please go and see the original far superior movie: Its called Brødre by Susanne Bier. You'll find the non-Hollywood actors also do a far superior job.",Brothers
232,josh_424-682-540963,Brothers will leave you wanting more.,8,10 March 2010,"Brothers is a tantalizing story of family, brotherhood and trust. Capt. Sam Cahill (Tobey Maguire) is call to duty in Afghanistan when his chopper goes down and is captured by Afghans as a P.O.W.Back home his wife Grace ( Natalie Portman) and two kids are informed that Sam has been K..I..A .While coping with they're loss, Sam's troubled brother Tommy fresh out of jail quickly reunited with Sam before leaving to Afghanistan. Tommy steps up as a father figure helping out anyway he can. As the movie progresses you start pulling for Tommy as he's getting his life on track and doing some good thing for Grace and the girls . Just as Tommy, Grace, and the kids are getting cozy with one another ;Grace gets a call that Sam is still alive.Sam arrives home never to be the same as when he left due to the torture he endure as a prisoner He see's how close Tommy and Grace have gotten and the girls are getting along. Accusations are made about their loyalty and jealousy sets in sending his world into turmoil letting his conscience get the best of him.This film is intense and leaves you wanting more every step of the way. The performances are outstanding from Maguire to Gyllenhaal and Portman they are superb, right down to Hank (Sam Shepard) Sam and Tommy's Father, as well as the daughters Isabelle (Bailee Madison) and Maggie (Taylor Geare) they make the movie as well.Brothers leaves you thinking and wondering what happened, but it's shows you The true meaning of family. Enjoy!",Brothers
233,rromaner,great acting,9,28 June 2010,"the acting was amazing even the children who knew Tobey Maguire was so good should be turned into a play because of its powerful message Jake was better than I ever expected. The scenes of the war were well done and authentic looking. The parents were not developed enough as characters. The girl who played the older child was amazing. Natalie Portman was very convincing as the devastated wife and mother but too pretty even though her appearance is referred to in the movie. This movie brings out the importance of returning veterans having more follow-up care for trauma. It becomes evident that returning GIs have substantial problems coming back and entering society. Also, alcoholism is spoken about but not addressed in depth.",Brothers
234,ib_w62,Please watch the original film Brødre instead,6,9 August 2010,"Please watch the original film Brødre (2004) by Susanne Bier instead. It's in Danish with English subtitles. It's more authentic and characters are depicted more in depth. Typically, it's a subtitled gem overlooked by a domestic audience. There was no need for a remake in the first place other than to embrace most of the ignorant American audience. Pardon my french. Most of you will be familiar with Connie Nielsen. However, Ulrich Thomsen is the most important character and does a superb acting in Brødre by changing the nature of his character. You can pick it up on Amazon but make sure to get in a format supported by your DVD-player.",Brothers
235,ausmovie,"Superb Acting, Outstanding Storyline",10,24 August 2010,"Amazing! That is the easiest way to describe this outstanding piece of work.I had what i would call 'Average' expectations going into this film after seeing the theatrical trailer. Needless to say i was shocked at the masterpiece that soon unfolded in front of me. The movie has an amazing trio of stars leading this film, each of which put forward an Oscar worthy performance. Brothers has outstanding Direction and writing which is easily seen by the way the simple plot is set up through the graphic and descriptive scenes. This is most definitely an Oscar worthy film that in my opinion is better than the original 2004 Danish original. Really this film is a must see, it truly is amazing. 10/10",Brothers
236,hharch,Underwhelmed by this one,4,17 April 2011,"I saw the original Danish production and was blown away by the power of it. Mind you, Connie Neillsen does that to me anyway, but the whole film resonated; right casting, masterly portrayal of the terrible but critical war scenes and above all a superbly moving ending. The ending of this one fell flat.When I read that the Americans are going to do a remake of a European film, I reach for my luger. I dreaded seeing what they'd do to this one. And sure enough, they delivered. It's as though art in a film won't wash with American audiences, so the Hollywood boys have to dumb it down and denature it to make it passable. It doesn't wash with me. I like the two lead male actors but the direction and scripting let them down. The only grounds for making a remake is to do it better than the original. This one doesn't measure up.",Brothers

SAM was a very strict and cold even if he love his family he lack the humor. he belief more in rules and following them. tommy in contrast was very open, easy going and lovely person not an evil.",Brothers

I am still thinking heavily about the movie the next day and the simply more than outstanding, excellent performance by Tobey Maguire as Sam Cahill. I was so very moved and I just can't gush enough about how good Tobey was in this role. And then when you factor in the other great performances by Jake Gyllenhaal, Natalie Portman, and Sam Shephard, not to mention the young actress who played one of the daughters, Bailee Madison.
I am so glad there is a movie that has highlighted the emotional trauma soldiers can experience and how it seems we sweep this problem under the rug in our nation.",Brothers

Watch the original please ;-) http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0386342/ Transferring the scene to an American background makes the film more watchable for Americans. The Danish version should get more credit. True, it is a good movie, but they should thank the danish writers and the danish director for this. As i see it, they have done more for this movie (even though they didn't make the American version)than Jim Sheridan has This is just the danish movie with American actors, nothing more. Like ""psycho"" from 1998, which was exactly the same movie as the one from 1960, just in colors and with different actors. The Danish movie is MUCH MUCH better. And really don't think the American writer should get any credit for this work.However, Jim Sheridan did an good job on directing, but still Susanne Biers version was much better, with the help of the best writer in Denmark, Anders Thomas Jensen (My Opinion)of course.",Brothers

There is a quiet nice and clean storyline in movie, tense atmosphere comes and goes quickly and shock us for moment but you can feel it from inside of every charecter , regret ,shame, jealousy and confussion

I think feelings sculptted well in this movie and it is the great pron of movie although there is no surprise in movie you can understand and feel this dialog: the question is can i live again?""",Brothers
