0,SnoopyStyle,Snickers Conundrum,6,14 March 2020,"It's the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta. Security guard Richard Jewell (Paul Walter Hauser) spots a suspicious backpack. It explodes and he becomes a hero. FBI agent Tom Shaw (Jon Hamm) suspects that Richard is the lone bomber looking for the adoration of the people. Kathy Scruggs (Olivia Wilde) is the aggressive reporter who starts a media firestorm which engulfs Richard and his mother Bobi (Kathy Bates). Watson Bryant (Sam Rockwell) takes on the challenge of being his lawyer.Wow! I did not expect to dislike Richard to start the movie. I expected a quiet momma's boy. My issue with him is that the man has no boundaries. If I was Watson, I would tell Richard to get his chubby little fingers out of my drawers. He could have pull out the Snickers bar from his pocket to give to Watson. Instead, he does it like a serial killer after going through someone's belongings. That may be a true story but it does not make it less creepy. It takes awhile after that to acclimatize to Richard and his peculiarities. He does grow on me over time especially after he gets angry. He stops being so infuriating. As for Scruggs, Clint Eastwood makes the mistake of turning her into a cartoon character. It would be vastly superior to have her as just another ambitious reporter which would be more indicting to modern media. She's like Wile E. Coyote or something. She's unreal. It's an insight into Eastwood's mentality more than anything. Overall, I grew to like this movie but it has a couple of speed bumps along the way.",Richard Jewell
1,boblipton,Life Is Complicated,10,5 January 2020,"On July 27, 1996, during the Atlanta Olympics, a pipe bomb went off at the game site, killing one and injuring 111 others. The toll might have been much higher, had not a security guard, Richard Jewell, noticed a suspicious-looking package, alerted the police, and helped them partially evacuate the area. He was immediately proclaimed a hero, and sought out for interviews on television. A few days later, information was leaked that the FBI was investigating him as the bomber, and the media frenzy over his accused villainy grew wilder than before.Clint Eastwood's movie is a follow-up to AMERICAN SNIPER. It investigates American obsession with simple narratives, heroism, and stereotypes. Paul Walter Hauser, who plays Jewell, is an unlikely-seeming hero. He is fat, speaks with a Georgia Cracker accent, acts slow-witted and impassive, and believes law enforcement is the highest calling. A far more likely hero is the FBI agent played by handsome John Hamm, who leads the investigation that, after he informs reporter Olivia Wilde that Jewell is being looked into as part of the routine (in return for sex), finds himself forced to go after Jewell; despite no positive evidence, he comes to believe in Jewell's guilt rather than admitting he had made a mistake. Sam Rockwell plays the lawyer who works hard and frustratedly to get Jewell to keep his mouth shut; Kathy Bates plays Jewell's mother.Eastwood directs this movie in a manner that keeps the audience looking frantically to see what is going on. The cinematically interesting events are always occurring at the edge of the screen or beyond the Venetian blinds. We grow angry with the frenzied attacks, because we are never in any doubt that Jewell was, in his own reckoning, in the right place at the right time to do his job. We demand that the world be saved by the handsome young man who gets to bed the beautiful woman and is never wrong. Until we learn to accept the reality, we stand in the gravest of danger.",Richard Jewell
2,Horst_In_Translation,American Clint Story,8,11 July 2020,"Okay, Clint Eastwood was not yet 90 when he made this 2019 film, but he was close to and he is now and I can only say how it is absolutely impressive with what this man still comes up at this age. I wonder if Scorsese, Tarantino and all the other defining filmmakers these days will deliver until such a high age. Or even live until that age and stay healthy enough to be in charge of such a project. As director I mean, but this is no surprise because Eastwood is not known for screenplays. The key writer in charge here was Oscar nominee Billy Ray. Very easy to remember. I already really liked his Oscar-nominated work on ""Captain Phillips"" and his newest effort (even if not Oscar-nominated) is just as good. A film as tense as it gets that will have you on the edge of your seat several times. And it literally flies by for a film considerably over two hours. That shows you how good it is. The film's only Oscar nomination went to previous winner Kathy Bates, who was considered maybe the only potential upset in the Supporting Actress category, but of course she didn't win. That is alright though. She is good here, but Oscar-worthy not really. She plays the title character's mother. You can read his name in the title, very simple choice for a title, but good enough. Maybe if you are American, you are aware of the man. Or if you care about the Olympics. I must say I did not know him before, but that is absolutely okay, so this film also had a major educational aspect for me. Richard Jewell worked as a security guard at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta and there was a bomb explosion. He was the man who saved many people's lives by directing attention to the rucksack the bomb was in and also helped immediately afterwards to make sure nobody is closer to the bomb than necessary. Before it went off. By the way, the moment the bomb squad guy takes a look into that rucksack is perhaps the most tense of the entire film. Incredible high-quality directing from Eastwood there. Also there was a similar scenario earlier in which another guy with a rucksack was walking around, but he only carried around beer for his friends. The cops did not care on either occasion, but Jewell cared twice and it shows that it is more crucial to be correct when it counts. even if you were wrong previously on another occasion. Than the other way around.Now a few words on the cast: The central character is played by Paul Walter Hauser. Not a big name by any means, but he played supporting characters on at least two pretty big movies before and I remember him well from ""I, Tonya"". He was funny there. He certainly is good enough to carry this film for the most part. I am glad they picked him and not Jonah Hill, who was also a possibility. The latter still produced and so did DiCaprio by the way. In any case, I am very happy with Hauser overall. Not a single bad moment. Eastwood directed real quality out of him. The bigger name is Sam Rockwell here. You wonder early on if he is already gone for good (out of the movie, not life) when Jewell quits his job, but nope. Rockwell has so much screen time in the second half that he is almost a lead actor. And he always managed to perfectly walk the fine line of delivering comedy in rather serious situations. The Snickers part at the beginning was fun though and also the radar nickname reference and a lot more involving Rockwell's character. Well, maybe how the investigation somehow fixed his relationship with his woman was a bit much, but it is okay. I read a bit about Jewell and I cannot find too much about Rockwell's character sadly, but what we see written on the screen at the very end implies that he indeed existed as well. To some extent at least. A lot here is fictitious as well. One example would be when Wilde's character is in the lawyer's car on one occasion. That was a bit much for sure. So yes, Olivia Wilde is in this film too. Great chancee for her to work with Eastwood, but she always gets a bit typecast it feels playing mostly unlikable shallow characters. Just like with ""Rush"". And also how her character transforms all of a sudden near the end, suddenly cares about journalistic integrity, did not make any sense to me with what we knew about her before that. I mean, if they had to go down that road, then at least don't go over the top with her tears after Bates' character's speech to the press. Definitely too much. Bates I mentioned already, not gonna say much more about her. She was good. Also because I just mentioned one flaw, here's another: The scene when Rockwell's character is running to see if Jewell could have made it in time and how they combined it with Michael Johnson's triumph was really a bit clumsy. I guess they somehow wanted to get in a bit more about the Olympics, so we don't forget about the background, but that was not the right choice. Or not the right execution at least. But really this is all I have in terms of negative criticisms. This film is really, really good otherwise. I guess Wilde's character's transformation also had someting to do with the fact that eventually the only antagonist was Jon Hamm's character. What can I say there? The man is always good. He personifies failure in this film. He did not stop the attack, could not save anybody. He even says on one occasion that he hates that he could not help. But all that follows afterwards is really even bigger failure. Be it his words to the journalist, in exchange for sex basically. How he agrees with the other FBI guy who sees Jewell as the prime suspect. The raid at Jewell's mom's house where they take so much that makes no sense and is unrelated to the case, like the mother's underwear, is just humiliating. I mean he does not take it in person, but he is the man in charge. Or how he eventually tells Jewell he still thinks he's guilty. But he gets his fair share too earlier when Jewell says that Hamm's character is the one most responsible for shattering his faith in the FBI after he admired them before all that.Okay, a few more additional side notes. Sadly, Jewell was not lucky enough to live a life as long as Eastwood. The brief reference about him touching his heart was also a nice little inclusion to project what happens after the film. But of course, it is all about the now there, about Jewell even becoming a police officer again at the very end. I must say though that until the moment when we find out about the real terrorist, I was also not 100% sure if Jewell is innocent, of course also because I am not aware of the case. But I think that was also the makers' intention here to some extent. You can never be 100% sure. And one thing I really want to mention is that everybody knows Eastwood is a Republican and I am pretty skeptical if this story would have been told, or would have been told with such quality, by a liberal filmmaker. Jewell clearly also had conservative views which we know when we find out about his gun collection, when we find out that hunting is his hobby and also when we find out that he did not want to be called a homosexual. The question still stays open as we never find out about any romantic interests the title character has, but it is not important either. The film is never about this at its center. Still it must be said that Eastwood and Billy Ray elaborated on the man's potential homophobia in the most charming way imaginable, even to an extent where several audience members would chuckle as soon as he got that comment in during the final talk with the FBI guys. By the way, the script is not exclusively by Billy Ray. The movie is also based on a book and, more notably, on a newspaper article by Marie Brenner, apparently also her third article that got turned into a really high-quality movie. That sure is impressive because it is an entirely different medium than writing a book in terms of being the basis for a film because you really have to get in so much (quality) into so little (quantity) to really make an impact and inspire filmmakers and screenplay writers to make a film based on your work. Big thumbs-up for Brenner here. And also big thumbs-up for everybody else who was working on this film. Sitting through the pandemic with theaters closed was not a good thing, but at least we have quality films like this one hitting theaters now that they are open again. The wait in this particular case was totally worth it. A contender for best film I have seen in 2020 and one of the best releases from 2019. I think you really wanna give this one a go. It is that good and also you do not have to care one bit about the subjects of sport, terrorism or the press to appreciate this film for what it is. A really, really fine crime thriller. Highly recommended. And by the way, if Laura Dern wins an Oscar for her so-so portrayal of a lawyer, then there is absolutely no justification for Rockwell being snubbed almost entirely here by awards circuits. Oh well, it probably was because he just won one. I definitely would have preferred him to be nominated for his performance here than for the abysmal propaganda movie ""Vice"". And I am saying this as somebody who is not much of a W fan. Drifting too far away now, so I shall end it. Just four more words: Absolutely. Watch. This. Movie. Thank you, Clint!",Richard Jewell
3,nogodnomasters,The kid is getting railroaded,9,4 February 2020,"This is a biopic of Richard Jewell (Paul Walter Hauser) who desired to have a job in law enforcement but only made it as high as a security guy for music concerts. The film opens in 1986 where we meet attorney Watson Bryant (Sam Rockwell) who likes Snickers Bars. It eventually moves to the bombing incident and the FBI and AJC ruining the man's life.Jewell is portrayed as a good ole country boy. He is unsophisticated but not entirely Junior Samples. He is how I remembered him. AJC reported Kathy Scruggs (Olivia Wilde) is portrayed as a woman with loose morals who knew how to get a story but not smart enough to write it. This looks more like a Clint Eastwood slap at the media. I recall WGST radio where Sean Hannity worked hired him for ""security"" and used his face in billboard promotions. They didn't include that in the feature.Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity.",Richard Jewell
4,kosmasp,A real Jewel(l),10,4 March 2021,"I had no idea what I was going to watch. If you've read some of my reviews (a lot I reckon) you may be familiar with my ""no trailers, as little information as possible before I watch anything. So while I had heard people praise this movie and the performances (main actor and Kathy Bates to name two that stand out a lot in my humble opinion), I had no clue what it would be about. I actually thought it'd be about someone who runs or something like that. Yes I am far off, as many if not all may know.I also had no clue that the movie was directed by Clint Eastwood ... but it makes a lot of sense. That guy knows a thing or two about movies. He may talk to empty chairs, but apart from that he is quite the character. This is quite the extra ordinary movie, with a character that may seem ... well not well educated, but is certainly not stupid. Could this lovely person that seems so sweet actually have a dark side to him? I think the answer is clear, so I wouldn't attest a big mystery here - and yet still the movie is able to hold the tension of the viewer. Which the director and the cast have a lot to do with! Outstanding! I probably should have watched this in a cinema ... but at least I did watch it finally! If you like great dramas, so should you!",Richard Jewell
5,classicsoncall,"""They're all after me now.""",8,23 October 2020,"I haven't been this ticked off by a movie in a long time. Well, not the movie so much as the treatment received by Richard Jewell (Paul Walter Hauser) from the FBI and an overzealous media. I'll never understand the quick rush to judgment on the part of authorities to condemn a suspect at the expense of finding out the truth. To be sure, Jewell didn't do himself any favors by being as forthcoming as he was; those scenes where he offered information to the agents raiding his home with mother and attorney present were frustrating as hell. You got the feeling he was his own worst enemy.But it was the tactics of FBI agent Shaw (Jon Hamm) that really got to me. Setting Jewell up with the incriminating phone call was the height of duplicity, while at the same time ignoring the time factor reenacted by attorney Bryant (Sam Rockwell) and his secretary (Nina Arianda), demonstrating how corrupt some agents become in pursuit of closing a case. By the way, I really liked the way director Clint Eastwood juxtaposed the record setting Olympic race by Michael Johnson with that effective demonstration proving Jewell couldn't have been the one to plant the bomb. Had Jewell been arrested and gone to trial, the evidence would have made mincemeat of the FBI case.I was surprised this film wasn't better acclaimed when it came out. To be sure, it's not one of Eastwood's best, but it was still a compelling film with a real human interest story at it's core. All the principals were excellent, and you know that when actors like Jon Hamm and Olivia Wilde (reporter Kathy Scruggs) elicit such strong feelings against their characters. As Richard Jewell, Hauser was a revelation portraying an otherwise unsympathetic character who you wanted to see achieve justice. I'm glad he was finally vindicated.",Richard Jewell
6,jboothmillard,Richard Jewell,6,10 February 2020,"This latest offering from actor-turned-director Clint Eastwood (Unforgiven, Million Dollar Baby, American Sniper, The Mule), or ""Clint Baby"" (me and my Mum's nickname for him), it is another movie based on a real story, and one that I looked forward to. Based on the true story, in 1986, Richard Jewell (Paul Walter Hauser) works as an office supply clerk in a small public law firm, where he builds a rapport with attorney Watson Bryant (Sam Rockwell). Hoping to work in law enforcement, he leaves the firm, becoming a security guard at Piedmont College. But after multiple complaints of acting beyond his jurisdiction he is fired. Jewell moves in with his mother Bobi (Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Kathy Bates) in Atlanta. In the summer of 1996, he works as a security guard at the Olympic Games, monitoring Centennial Park. In the early hours of the morning on July 27, 1996, during a Jack Mack and the Heart Attack concert, Jewell chases off a group of drunken revellers. After this, Jewell notices a suspicious package beneath a bench near the base of a concert sound tower, he urges authorities to call a bomb squad as a precaution. The explosives expert confirms the backpack contains an explosive device, made up of three pipe bombs surrounded by three-inch-long (7.6 cm) masonry nails. The security team, including police officers, FBI agent Tom Shaw (Jon Hamm), and Jewell's friend Dave Dutchess (Niko Nicotera), starts moving the concert audience away from the bomb when it detonates. The blast directly kills one person and injures 111 other people, and Jewell is initially heralded as a hero for discovering the bomb. At the FBI office in Atlanta, Shaw and his team have suspicions about Jewell, being a white male, a ""wannabe"" police officer, fits the profile of common perpetrators who have committed similar crimes, thinking he is seeking glory and attention for saving lives from a dangerous situation they caused themselves. Shaw is approached by journalist Kathy Scruggs (Olivia Wilde) of the Atlanta-Journal Constitution. In exchange for sex, Shaw reveals that Jewell is a prime suspect for the FBI. The Constitution publishes Scruggs' story on the front page, disclosing the FBI's interest in Jewell. Scruggs makes particularly notes Jewell's physique, the fact he lives with his mother, and work history to reassure herself that he fits the FBI's profile. The story quickly becomes international news. Jewell, initially unaware of the change of his public perception, is lured to the FBI office. At first, he cooperates but refuses to sign an acknowledgement he has been read his rights, and instead phones Watson Bryant for legal representation. Bryant, now running his own struggling law firm, agrees and makes Jewell aware he is a prime suspect. Shaw and partner Dan Bennet (Ian Gomez) visit the dean of Piedmont College, who mentions his past grievances, this reinforces their suspicions of Jewell. The FBI searches Jewell's home and seize property including true crime books and a selection of firearms. Jewell admits to Bryant that he has been avoiding taxes for years and was once arrested for exceeding his authority. Bryant scolds Jewell for being too cooperative with the police officers investing him. Jewell admits his ingrained respect for authority makes it difficult for him not to be obedient, even when the authorities are trying to do him harm. Jewell and Bryant confront Scruggs, demanding a retraction and apology, but she stands by her reporting. Bryant, still unconvinced of Jewell's innocence, and his long-suffering secretary Nadya Light (Nina Arianda) time the distance between the phone booth and bomb site, concluding it is impossible for someone to phone in the bomb threat and discover the bomb at the time it was found. Scruggs and Shaw reach the same conclusion, and the FBI questions if the crime included an accomplice. As their case weakens, the FBI try to link Dutchess to Jewell as a possible homosexual accomplice. Bryant arranges a polygraph examination (lie detector) which Jewell passes, removing Bryant's doubt about his innocence. Bobi holds a press conference and pleads for an end to the investigation so she and her son can get on with their lives. Jewell and Bryant meet with Shaw and Bennet at the FBI office, and after some irrelevant questions, Jewell realises they have no real evidence against him. He finally loses his sense of awe for law enforcement officers and asks pointedly if they are ready to charge him, their silence convinces him to leave. 88 days later, Jewell is informed by formal letter that he is no longer ""a person of interest"" and no longer under investigation. In April 2005, Jewell, now a police officer in Luthersville, Georgia, is visited by Bryant who tells him that Eric Rudolph (Eric Mendenhall) has confessed to the Centennial Olympic Park bombing. The end text details that Richard Jewell died two years later, August 29, 2007, aged 44, of complications from diabetes and heart failure. Also starring Charles Green as Dr. W. Ray Cleere, Dylan Kussman as FBI Special Agent Bruce Hughes and Mike Pniewski as Brandon Hamm. Hauser, who looks spot on to the real Jewell, gives a terrific performance as socially awkward man with a simpleton personality who is the victim of a horrible injustice, Bates does very well as the mother determined to help him, Hamm is a bit of a cartoonish villain, and Wilde is just a little ridiculous as the headline-hungry journalist. It is a very interesting true story of a man unjustly thrown into the spotlight with false allegations against him, some of the material Eastwood throws in does get a little heavy-handed, but it is a mostly believable portrayal, it even features footage of the real Richard Jewell in the television interviews, a worthwhile biographical drama. Good!",Richard Jewell
7,BandSAboutMovies,Eh,4,27 May 2020,"Paul Walter Hauser got known for playing Shawn Eckhardt in I, Tanya. Here, he's playing another real life media story, the character this movie is named for, Richard Jewell.This is directed by Clint Eastwood, who does one take for every scene and people love him for it. Yes, the same reason these same people made fun of Ed Wood.As much as this movie presents the media killing the life of Jewell, it does the very same thing to reporter Kathy Scruggs, who died of a prescription drug overdose in 2001.There's a scene where she offers sex to Jon Hamm's FBI agent in exchange for information, a moment that the editor-in-chief of The Atlanta Journal-Constitution stated was ""entirely false and malicious."" Employees of the newspaper went even further, claiming that the movie should have a disclaimer that ""some events were imagined for dramatic purposes and artistic license.""Olivia Wilde defended the film and wondered why no one held Hamm's character to the same standard. That's probably because his character, Tom Shaw, is a composite based on many people and not an actual person who lived and breathed and left behind people that cared for her.That makes it hard to believe in this film's defense of Jewell when it commits the very same attacks on Scruggs. That said, Hauser is good and I always enjoy seeing Sam Rockwell show up.",Richard Jewell
8,searchanddestroy-1,Is there a candidate to become another Richard Jewell?,9,13 February 2021,"The most important thing I have heard in this film is the question that Jewell asks to the FBI goons who put him nearly under arrest: After all this, who would dare to declare a bomb seen among a crowd, WHO would be dumb enough to save people, to prevent a massacre, with the threat to be accused for having put the bomb, just for being a celebrity? "" These are not the exact words, but the meaning is just this. And it is obviously logic and fair to ask this relevant question. I admit that the possibility exists that a person puts a bomb and then declares to have found a bomb, just for being a hero. yes, definitely yes, that possibility exists, nothing is impossible in this world - see 11/9.... - but it is highly improbable. Me, after viewing this film, if I saw a suspect package in the subway, I would ran away and that's all. And no one could accuse me afterwards to have seen it and run away. No one. If there is no bomb, the question is not even conceivable. And if the bomb explodes, there will be no more witness to testify against the coward. Unlike no assisting a person attacked of collapsing on the sidewalk. You can be sued for this, and that's a damn good thing. How can you prove that someone saw a package or not under a subway or bus seat? Now back to this film, as usual with Eastwood, this is a pure...Jewell. Convincing at one hundred percent, in a country where everyone speaks to you with your first name, but is ready to tear you into pieces, to shred you, FOR ANY REASON at all. Eastwood is definitely a far better director than actor. As a film maker he has given us so many proofs of his skills, so many, for such a prolific and gifted movie magician. His features have something special, that many others have not.",Richard Jewell

10,CinemaSerf,Never let the truth get in the way of the FBI....,7,6 February 2020,"I was working in Atlanta for a broadcaster the night of the Atlanta bombing at the Olympics so remember quite a lot of the immediate aftermath and the enormous speculation into what had actually happened and of the expectations put on law enforcement to convince not just the USA but the rest of the world that the Games were safe. This film is an authentic take on these days with a strong performance from Paul Walter Hauser as the security guard who found the bomb only to be later accused of having planted it in the first place. Sam Rockwell is great as the attorney determined not to cave in to the pressure and ensure his client gets a fair hearing as the authorities appear determined to scapegoat him. Kathy Bates plays his mum strongly, too. It's far too long, though - and at times it sags in the middle - it is virtually impossible to sustain the level of intense dialogue. It's a good film, but not a great film.",Richard Jewell
11,zardoz-13,Another Top-Notch Clint Eastwood Directorial Effort,10,25 March 2020,"Since he made ""Invictus"" (2009), superstar actor Clint Eastwood has helmed only one movie, ""Hereafter"" (2010), which wasn't been based on an actual event. Ostensibly, beginning with ""Invictus,"" Eastwood has been attracted to factual events. After his election as President of South Africa, Nelson Mandela (Morgan Freeman) assembled an invincible rugby team to unite his country in the wake of Apartheid. Afterward, Eastwood scrutinized the controversial life story of infamous FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover in ""J. Edgar"" (2011), with Leonardo DiCaprio portraying Uncle Sam's alpha crime-buster. In ""The Jersey Boys"" (2014), Clint dramatized the early years of the rock-n-roll group The Four Seasons. He followed it up with one of his highest-grossing films, ""American Sniper"" (2014), the battlefield biography of the late Chris Kyle. Following this unforgettable war film, Eastwood reenacted the aerial genius of airline pilot Chesley 'Sully' Sullenberger (Tom Hanks) who landed a doomed flight on the Hudson River in ""Sully"" (2012). Nobody died, and Sully skyrocketed to instant heroism. In ""The 15:13 to Paris"" (2018), Eastwood persuaded real-life participants Anthony Sadler, Alek Skarlatos, and Spencer Stone to play themselves as the trio that thwarted a deadly terrorist attack on a train traveling through France. Finally, doubling up as director and star for ""The Mule"" (2019), Eastwood cast himself as a 90-something horticulturist who became a successful Mexican cartel drug mule until his arrest and imprisonment a decade later.Eastwood's latest movie ""Richard Jewell"" focuses on the dumb luck of a good 0le boy, Richard Jewell (Paul Walter Hauser), who found a pipe-bomb in a backpack beneath a bench at Centennial Park in Atlanta, Georgia, during the Summer Olympics, on July 27, 1996. When the bomb exploded, one person died at the scene, while over 100 spectators suffered injuries. Initially hailed as a hero for his timely action, Jewell didn't have long to savor his ephemeral fame. Incredibly, the FBI and the local newspaper The Atlanta Journal-Constitution accused him of planting the bomb in the first place to gain recognition for his courageous act! The authorities suspected Jewell as the culprit based on similar cases where inconspicuous individuals, craving the limelight of celebrity status, had taken credit for a heroic act despite having planned it ahead of time. Basically, ""Richard Jewell"" depicts how the Bureau and the media set out systemically to railroad a naive nincompoop for a crime he couldn't have committed. Constantly harassing Jewell without mercy, the FBI turned his life into a nightmare. Eventually, in 2003, the FBI would nab the actual bomber, domestic terrorist Eric Rudolph, who had been on the Bureau's Ten Most Wanted List for five years. Ultimately, Jewell was never charged with any crime. Nevertheless, the Feds and the media tarnished both Jewell's name and reputation in their campaign to smear him.Mind you, Richard Jewell was no broad-shouldered, square-jawed, matinee idol hero. Eastwood cast little known character actor Paul Walter Hauser as the well-meaning but clueless chump, and Hauser delivers a convincing performance. Short, potbellied, and hopelessly dim-witted, Jewell had cherished the dream of a career in law enforcement. After some early setbacks, our humble hero landed a position at an Atlanta university as a campus security guard. Real-life Piedmont University President Raymond Cleere (Charles Green of ""What Women Want"") hired and then later fired Jewell for his ill-advised antics. If Cleere's name sounds familiar, it should. Cleere served as Mississippi's first commissioner of higher education and presided on the first public higher education desegregation case before the U.S. Supreme Court. Not long after Jewell's act of heroism, Cleere contacted the FBI about the former security guard.FBI Agent Tom Shaw (Jon Hamm of ""The Town"") had attended the event, and he had been caught completely off-guard by the bombing. Embarrassed by his own flat-footed negligence, Shaw launched himself tirelessly into solving the case. An irresponsible, scoop-happy reporter, Kathy Scruggs (Olivia Wilde of ""A Vigilante"") aggravated matters. Charming Shaw into the sack, she discovered that the Bureau's prime suspect was none other than Jewell! Scruggs urges her editor to publish the story before anybody else runs it. Suddenly Jewell finds himself tormented by both the Bureau and the news media. Unscrupulously, Shaw and his FBI cohorts pull every dirty trick in the book. When intimidation fails, they try to cajole Jewell into coughing up a juicy confession. Specifically, they hoodwink him into participating in an exercise where he impersonates Rudolph and recites the bomber's telephone threat that 911 recorded about 30 minutes before the backpack detonated.
Jewell hires an attorney, Watson Bryant (Sam Rockwell of ""Vice""), who he had met earlier when he worked at another company where Bryant was an attorney. Bryant has a difficult time muzzling his client. Repeatedly, he scolds Jewell about cooperating with the FBI. Agent Shaw intensifies the pressure on Jewell and obtains a search warrant. He confiscates Jewell's small arsenal of firearms and his mother's Tupperware collection for scrutiny. Jewell's mother Bobi (Kathy Bates of ""Misery"") is aghast by the way the authorities mistreat her son. Eventually, when the FBI cannot pin the bombing on Jewell, they relent and call it quits. Earlier, Scruggs calculated Jewell couldn't have made the ominous phone call since the nearest phone booth was too far away for him to have gotten back to Centennial Park in time for the explosion. Shaw contends Jewell had an accomplice, and they try to pressure one of Jewell's few friends, Dave Dutchess (Niko Nicotera of ""Saving Lincoln""), into confessing to a part in the crime.""Richard Jewell"" is a sobering, larger-than-life expose. Clint Eastwood celebrates the triumph of an unfairly maligned man over a brazen system of justice, which mistakenly sought to make him a scapegoat. Paul Walter Hauser's brilliant performance as this gullible little guy who lived with his mom recalls Mervyn LeRoy's classic thriller ""They Won't Forget"" (1937) where the authorities wrongly convicted an innocent bystander and an impetuous public lynched him based on flawed evidence. Altogether, ""Richard Jewell"" is a gem!",Richard Jewell
12,grantss,Another great drama from Clint Eastwood,8,5 October 2020,"Richard Jewell is a security guard at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics when he discovers a bomb, saving countless lives and making him an instant hero. However, due to his chequered past the FBI make him a prime suspect. An unscrupulous FBI agent leaks this information to an even less scrupulous reporter, resulting in Richard Jewell's life being turned into a nightmare.Clint Eastwood's latest movies have tended to be based on real life events and characters with the central character(s) usually being everyday people who do something heroic. He then builds an engaging, interesting story around this. 'Sully' was a great example of this ('The 11:17 to Paris', unfortunately, was not. Though based on an heroic event, the film was sub-par).Richard Jewell follows in this trend, both thematically and quality-wise. The hero here is an unlikely one: an overweight, not-too-bright, security guard with an officious 'respect my authority' complex. But it works. Eastwood works his magic, taking us on the journey, getting us to root for the underdog. His efforts are aided by a solid performance by Paul Walter Hauser as Jewell, a superb performance by Sam Rockwell as his lawyer, Watson Bryant, and good support from Olivia Wilde, Kathy Bates and John Hamm.Throw in some interesting themes, especially of police harassment and the destructive, defamatory power of the media and you have a great film.",Richard Jewell
13,ferguson-6,try these shoes on,7,12 December 2019,"Greetings again from the darkness. Imagine you are being falsely accused of a terrorist act that killed and injured people. You are the FBI's primary suspect. Your name and face are spread across every possible media outlet. Your belongings have been searched and seized as evidence - right down to your mom's Tupperware. Cameras follow your every step of every day. Now imagine all of this occurs mere days after your actions actually saved lives and you were hailed as a hero across all of those same media outlets. Richard Jewell didn't have to imagine this, as he lived this nightmare in 1996.We first see Richard (played by Paul Walter Hauser in one of the year's best performances) as a supply clerk at a law firm in 1986. His awkward ways and surprising efficiency catches the eye of attorney Watson Bryant (Oscar winner Sam Rockwell), a quasi-connection that comes into play a decade later. We then jump ahead those 10 years to find Richard being fired from his campus security job at a college due to his over-zealous focus on protocol. Fortunately for Richard, the Olympics are coming to Atlanta, so finding work as a security guard is pretty easy.Atlanta's Centennial Olympic Park is shown with crowds of people cheering at a Kenny Rogers and later dancing the Macarena. As one of the on-site security guards, Richard spots a suspicious backpack that turns out to be holding the bomb that detonates, creating tragedy for many. As the viewing audience, we know that Richard's actions saved lives and he most definitely was not responsible for planting the bomb. And it's that knowing that places us as close as possible to the Richard Jewell experience.Four-time Oscar winner Clint Eastwood directs yet another story of a working-class hero. Only this time, he blatantly calls out what he sees as two evil forces: the U.S. Government (the FBI) and the media. Billy Ray (CAPTAIN PHILLIPS, SHATTERED GLASS) based his script on the 1997 Vanity Fair article ""American Nightmare: The Ballad of Richard Jewell"" by Marie Brenner (who also wrote the article that was the source for THE INSIDER, 1999). It can be argued that Eastwood comes down hard on the FBI and the media, but you might consider putting yourself in Richard Jewell's shoes before crying foul.Jon Hamm has perfected the role of cocksure FBI agent and here he plays Tom Shaw as the man totally focused on proving Richard Jewell was the perpetrator. Much has been made of Eastwood's depiction of Atlanta Journal-Constitution reporter Kathy Scruggs (played by Olivia Wilde, who directed this year's surprise hit BOOKSMART). It's a bit curious that the uproar is over what some interpret as a reporter trading intimate relations for a scoop, yet Eastwood's contempt seems focused more on the idea of trying a citizen's case in public ... while lacking any real evidence outside of a profile. The reporter (Ms. Scruggs passed away in 2001) is certainly portrayed as an ultra-aggressive reporter desperate for a headline story, but the implied consensual affair occurred after the inside information was provided - and the FBI agent was actually surprised... ""Is this really going to happen?"" Perhaps the viewer reaction to this is a sign of the times, but I'm guessing if any one of Eastwood's critics were similarly falsely accused (as Jewell), the fictionalized version of the reporter would be less important than having the truth discovered. Of course, this could have been easily avoided had the name of the reporter been changed for the film.Two key supporting roles come courtesy of Oscar winner Kathy Bates as Richard's mother Bobi, and Nina Arianda as Watson Bryant's paralegal. Ms. Bates starts out as a loving and simple mother to Richard, but her press conference captures the character in a new light. It's a strong and heartfelt performance. Ms. Arianda brings some warmth sprinkled with welcome sarcasm to her role. Mr. Hauser is spot-on in every scene, and when these four are all together, it's a pleasure to watch. Hauser and Rockwell are especially good in their scenes together as the 'wronged man' contrasted with the take-no-guff attorney.Every time Richard says ""I'm law enforcement too"", it's heart-breaking to us and an opening for the FBI to manipulate him. The profile of a single white male living at home with his mom, carrying gung-ho dreams of a career in law enforcement, while collecting guns and knowledge on bombs and police procedure, made Richard Jewell seem like the kind of guy who would do something for attention. However, the film and the true story both emphasize the danger of prematurely persecuting individuals - especially in public. These days the race is always about who is first with a story, rather than who is right. A rush to judgment can be seen as an abuse of power, whether it's by the media, a law enforcement agency, or folks on social media. At this stage of his career, director Eastwood seems more interested in telling stories than showing one. He offers up little visual artistry outside of the terrific performances, but this story ... it's a doozy.",Richard Jewell
14,morrison-dylan-fan,A Jewel.,8,7 February 2020,"Dumped to one screening a day at my local cinema after it flopped in the US. Being intrigued by details about the film,I decided to arrange with a friend who is a Clint Eastwood fan, that we go and meet Richard Jewell.View on the film:Skating to this bio-pic, Paul Walter Hauser (who played Shawn Eckardt in I, Tonya (2017-also reviewed) by chance, a person who the subject of this film was compared to on late night talk shows) gives a superb, expressive performance as Jewell. Firmly believing that the police are always good and pure, Hauser presents Jewell's beliefs as innocent, rather than naive, due to his willingness to help the cops, leading to a sinking suspicion that he's being taken advantage of,in order to get framed.The only woman in his life, Kathy Bates gives a thoughtful turn as his mum Bobi, who rather than being completely motherly, is given a cynic edge by Bates towards the friendliness of the cops, whilst a wonderful Sam Rockwell brings a jagged edge to Bryant's fight to get Jewell out of the frame.Tracking the faceless bomber from out of the crowd placing the device, director Clint Eastwood reunites with cinematographer Yves Belanger, and ignites a continuation of themes Eastwood explored in Changeling (2008), turning the screws with razor-sharp editing from his regular editor Joel Cox in closing in on the isolated loner, whose attempts to stay sane via remembering/flashing back to each detail that took place, shaking them with doubt.Working in the lowest ranks of policing, Eastwood brings out a light comedic warmth (whilst remaining respectful) in how enthusiastic Jewell is in the job, stylishly panning down the school halls and concert venues where Jewell deals with bratty teens. Including the false addition that reporter Kathy Scruggs used sex to get leaks from the FBI,this needless plot line comes off as poorly misplaced within the earthy tone of the title.Guarding a major theme which runs across Eastwood works of the little guy up against a the press and antagonizing authority figures, the screenplay by Billy Ray brilliantly gathers tension from the sea change of Jewell being seen as a blue collar local hero, to becoming washed over by those who want to make a open/shut case, with a jewel.",Richard Jewell
15,bombersflyup,"It's alright, ending is flat.",5,6 March 2020,"Richard Jewell is a solid biographical picture. I just don't like the story being told, where a hero's cast a villain.The people responsible for this, the FBI agents and reporter have no repercussions, it's appalling. It's like Jewell says, the next security guard that sees something suspicious isn't gonna call it in and in this case the next agents and reporters are going to do more of the same. Sadly it's the way the world operates, but it's also a disappointing conclusion to a film. Sam Rockwell and Paul Walter Hauser give good performances though.",Richard Jewell
16,phd_travel,Scathing indictment - you will feel indignant at the injustice,10,10 January 2020,"There have been other miscarriage of justice or wrongfully accused movies before but this is the best. Here it's a double whammy because the guy wrongfully accused was actually the hero. It's extremely involving and you will be almost jumping out of your seat with indignation at the Atlanta Journal and the FBI. Plus there is a lot of humor built in like how he can't stop talking to the cops after being told not to talk to the cops.
The actors are perfect for their roles. Olivia Wilde is super as the unscrupulous reporter who would do anything for a story. Jon Hamm is just right as the ultimate bad cop FBI agent. Kathy Bates is moving as the mother of Richard and you feel her pain. Paul Hauser as Richard is totally believable. The wonderful Sam Rockwell is the ideal underdog lawyer.Clint Eastwood movies are usually glacially slow but here the deliberate pace never feels draggy and you are able to get all the details. Don't understand how this movie flopped at the box office and wasn't nominated for more awards. It's much more involving than the other nominated movies the Irishman.",Richard Jewell
17,gradyharp,'I'm sorry the world has gone insane',9,10 August 2020,"The truth is stranger than fiction - a phrase that could be applied to this cinematic portrayal of an actual event and person. Clint Eastwood produced and directed this rather extraordinary film that, aside from relating an historic event, sheds light on the machinations of the press and the government when an explosive event occurs: the rush to judgment to satisfy the public, the police, the ultra-hungry press, the Georgia Board of Investigation, the FBI and more can obscure solid facts and investigation when a 'possible terrorist' is suspected as the perpetrator.Richard Jewell (Paul Walter Hauser) is an obese, flawed man, unable to gain or maintain his desired place in law enforcement who lives with his mother Bobi (Kathy Bate) in Atlanta. The year - 1996 - the year of the Summer Olympic Games o the XXVI Olympiad. Richard is a security guard at Centennial Park, notes a suspect backpack, alerts the unbelieving security police and TV film crew until finally his suspicions are heeded. The bomb in the backpack explodes and Richard does his best to protect the crowd, becoming a celebrity overnight due to the attention of the television media etc. One headline hungry reporter (Olivia Wilde) pastes together rumors and weak ideas and convinces the FBI (Jon Hamm) that Richard is a terrorist - a false accusation that creates an implosion of Richard's life, his only support system beside his mother is a lawyer friend Watson Bryant (Sam Rockwell), an anti-establishment crusader, who with his assistant Nadya (Nina Arianda) stays with Richard until the false case is dropped.The entire cast is excellent - many small but significant roles assigned to fine actors - but the performance by Hauser is a star turn. Not only is the film solid, but it also has some keen points to make about our legal system and the press. Everyone should see this movie.",Richard Jewell
18,mm-39,Best movie of 2019!,10,28 December 2019,"Richard Jewell is one of the best movies of 2019! Why? Well Richard Jewell is a human tragidy story, which hits the viewer hard. Eastwood directs a story about the human condition. All of Eastwood characters are real life 3 d people. Richard Jewell is a character development story. Each character builds the story of Richard Jewell. The lead protagonist Jewell has frailties, which are reflected as both Jewell's strengths and weaknesses. Jewell is not a popular man at work. He is over zealous, and detailed oriented. Part of what builds the movie Richard Jewell is that people insult Jewell as the bubba class person of Georgia , but those negative bubba attributes saved peoples lives. What makes the story debatable but human is the portrayal of the F B I and media. The middle part has a reporter and Eastwood's interpretation of how she got the leak and the media attack of a hero Jewell is debatable, but the different theories of a ruthless media hits a nerve of the public today. The same with the tunnel vision of the F B I. is their interpretation of what the F B I did or are the foundations we trust of law enforcement and media tainted and human. The older I get the more doubts I have about so called professionalism. How much of the media, F B I is normal procedure and rest just trying to create a narrative from a tip from an employer and a F B I profile. The guy my be odd or fits a profile, but how far profiling is just educated guess or forcing a theory of Richard being involved in gay bombing conspiracy with gay men when no evidence is ever found!?! The reporter who leaked the story is hit with guilt, and the hard nose Lawyer hides a soft side are the details which makes the character real and human. Flawed but real. Richards mom (Bates) did a believable portrayal of a family in crisis. Richard Jewell is a compelling movie which asks about the government and media. As the movie states the 2 most powerful forces with so much power can go down hard on one man, is a thought provoking movie. 10 stars.",Richard Jewell
19,deloudelouvain,"Great story, cast and director.",9,25 June 2020,"Now this is the kind of movie I really enjoy, a good story based on true events, excellent actors and a great director. Clint Eastwood was already a very good actor, but as a director he's even better. Everything he touches or makes turns into a gem, we got to give him credits for that. The story of Richard Jewell, played beautifully by Paul Walter Hauser, is one of those stories that makes you want to revolt. Revolt against the media, those bloodsucking leeches that are prepared to sell their soul to the devil just to have a story, no matter what, destroying lives or not, it just doesn't matter to those parasites. We've seen it plenty of times and this story is a perfect example of it. But also revolting against the law enforcement, another kind of people that couldn't care less if they're right or wrong, as long as they get their satisfaction it's all right. Great movie, great cast. Sam Rockwell and Kathy Bates both were great in this movie. This movie is near perfect and that's thank to Clint Eastwood, one of my favorite directors since awhile now.",Richard Jewell
20,blanbrn,Well done with detail a look at an unsung and common hero with courage who faced doubt!,9,15 December 2019,"Clint Eastwood has once again done it as a director as he brings drama and emotion to the big screen so well. As this time with this drama type biography picture ""Richard Jewell"" which is based on the life and real events of the 1996 Olympic games bombing in Atlanta, GA which involved Richard who first was a life saving hero only to later be looked at upon by the media and government as a possible suspect.Jewell(Paul Walter Hauser) who comes across as likeable and the type of guy you would want to have a beer with is an overweight southern guy who wants to be a top cop only he shines as a college security guard before getting his big break to work security detail at the 1996 games in Atlanta. Now it's by chance and timing should I say be in the wrong place at the right time or be in the right place at the right time that the events of the exploding bomb will change his life forever.First the big jolly guy is looked upon as an angel in the night a hero, only soon the media and overprotective and yes man government zero in on him as a maybe terrorist who did the bombing! It's like Richard did this to cure his thirst for fame as if he can't be a top cop then this event can cure his ego. The film really gets in depth and detail as it's really tense with drama as the investigation and interviews switch into high gear Jon Hamm shines as FBI agent Tom Shaw who handles the case. And Kathy Scruggs( in a tease and sexy turn from Olivia Wilde) takes pictures and looks really pretty as the top reporter for Atlanta's top newspaper as all she wants is a Richard did it story!Thru it all Richard stays afloat and sails the storms of the sea with the help and support from his loving and caring protective mom Bobi(Kathy Bates) really this man has to prove and clear his name from all of the drama that comes with being a good guy! Along the way an old friend and former employer named Watson Bryant(the great Sam Rockwell) now an attorney helps Richard with the legal things like depositions and interviews before his name is cleared!Overall this movie is heartfelt with emotion and drama showing how courage came to a common man and how will and determination put his name in the clear as the doubters didn't destroy him. Really one of Clint's best works in years.",Richard Jewell

It becomes another peeve since Richard is portrayed as if he is more concerned to clear that he is not gay than the capital punishment hanging around his head, the joke might be marginally funny at then, but in this day and age, it is regressive and sneer-inducing.""read my full review on my blog: cinema omnivore, thanks",Richard Jewell

23,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,Eastwood applies his usual adept touch to this searing true life drama,9,7 February 2020,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningIn 1986, while working as a campus security guard, Richard Jewell (Paul Walter Hauser) has his first encounter with aspiring attorney Watson Bryant (Sam Rockwell), and the unlikely pair bond over a love of arcade games. Ten years later, and Richard has his law enforcement badge, and is now working security at the 1996 Atlanta Olympic Games, but is still out of shape, and living with his mother Bobi (Kathy Bates.) When he tries to clear the area when a suspect package is discovered, after the device detonates, he finds himself going from being regarded as a hero, to being the chief suspect, after errant journalist Kathy Scruggs (Olivia Wilde) and headstrong FBI agent Tom Shaw (Jon Hamm) conspire to put him in the frame, causing him to reunite with his old friend Bryant for the legal battle of his life.In recent years, Clint Eastwood has made a habit of documenting these instances of real life having more dramatic potential than fiction, from the American Sniper Kyle Lord, to Sully the airline pilot who saved all the lives, which have more of a wow factor to those on this side of the pond less familiar with the stories. Of all of them, his latest, RJ, is the one I have found the most engaging and emotionally investing, although maybe for personal reasons.Despite being a more conservative director, Eastwood has, perhaps unwittingly, placed himself as an unlikely social justice champion, in highlighting the case of the gentle natured, unassuming Richard Jewell, exposing how those we see as different we also see as less. The cynical, manipulative institutions of the media and law enforcement shamefully proved in this damning real life case how someone like Richard Jewell could serve as a perfect scapegoat. A thirty three year old, childless, obese man, living at home with his mother, with his simple minded, cookies and cream view of the world, unable to really stand up for himself away from his security work and his guns. Nobody's romanticised version of what anyone would look up to be, and unwittingly at the mercy of those with less innocent ideals. I found an uncomfortable parallel with myself in him that gave it all a more personal touch.Boosted by reliably sturdy performances, from Rockwell as the dedicated, determined lawyer fighting on his friend's behalf, to Wilde as the callous journalist wrecking a man's life, and of course from Walter Hauser as the righteous but humble Jewell, and assured direction from the now eighty nine year old Eastwood, it's a shockingly revealing depiction of just what not fitting the grain can get you. ****",Richard Jewell
24,ElMaruecan82,"The man who had everything of a hero, but the profile, and nothing of a criminal, but the profile...",8,29 October 2021,"Eastwood has recently shed the light on so many real-life 'great American heroes' that you'd wonder if it was a speciality or a matter of honor. A little of both I guess.In a world where the worth of people is measured by terms such as popularity, success, influence or victimhood, Eastwood paid tribute to the humblest ones who simply did the right thing at the right moment, from ""Sully"""" who conducted an emergency landing on the water to the three American tourists who prevented the attack on the train to Paris and finally Richard Jewell, the late security guard who saw the backpack containing the bomb during the Atlanta Olympic Games.If Richard couldn't prevent the explosion, his intervention let enough time to create a security perimeter that considerably limited the death toll. Hailed a hero first, Jewell became a prime suspect for lack of any other clue and a craving for sensationalism 2 years before the Monicagate. While I was critical of the over-dramatization of Sully's story, I'm glad Eastwood found a storyline that could make the formula work. He doesn't really thrive for originality, media power and police injustice have been darlings for biopics, but it's not what happens to Jewell that counts but how he reacts to it and how all the ideals he abided by in his life were lost.Such a story couldn't avoid the rise of the conspiracy theory, the scoop-thirsty journalist or the obligatory scene where FBI agents force Richard to sign some suspicious official document, but the best thing about ""Richard Jewell"" is Jewell himself, for many reasons, even some superficial but not irrelevant ones. To give you an idea, for many years, Eastwood provided heroes who could be controversial or inspiring but there was something undeniably appealing about them. Chris Kyle was a 6'4'' patriot, even in the ""15:17 to Paris"" I mentioned in my review the importance of physicality when it blends with pure ideals, if only to be strong enough to neutralize a terrorist. I almost concluded the film thinking that being a hero started with looking like one.Now, I'm glad a film proved me wrong and I'm glad it was Eastwood himself to contradict me and boy, am I glad, for the posthumous legacy of the real Jewell, that Eastwood lived long enough to fix these injustices and remind us that not all heroes wear capes or work for MI7. Richard Jewell (Paul Michael Hauser) didn't have the look, he was an overweight man, white, living with his mother Bobbi (played by Kathy Bates), he was a by-the-book officer who intimidated campus pricks and nourished lifelong dreams of becoming a law enforced, he collected guns like nerds comic-books and at home he wore bermuda and sandals with socks, hardly the Bruce Willis type. But once you scratch the surface, the insights you get on Jewell makes less surprising that he lived long enough to be a hero.The script written by Billy Ray, follows a similar formula than ""15:17"" showing quicks flashbacks that help us establish Jewell's personality and the people who count in his life. He starts as a simple supply office clerk in a law firm where he befriends a lawyer named Watson Bryant (Sam Rockwell). Their interactions hint at everything we need to know about Jewell: he's well-educated, ambitious and has an eye for detail as he knew which chocolate to provide Watson from the wrappers in his trash bin. Is it because the man kept such a low profile and looked down that he developed that eye? Or that he's so lucid about men's treacherous nature that he took notes of the orders he was given? Not that it prevented him from being fired anyway.Point is this is a man with ideals, beliefs, true competence, humility but a Clint Eastwood or a Bradley Cooper he ain't, and that he's a Momma's boy. Around him, Jon Hamm plays a ruthless FBI officer, and Olivia Wilde is the ambitious go-getter Kathy Schruggs who wants a paper for Atlanta and wouldn't hesitate to use her charm for it. I think this was less an attempt to exploit a sexist trope than to highlight the fact that decent man like Jewell wouldn't be suspected if there wasn't malice behind. And that was 1996, before September 11, before the Internet and the social networks, 1996 would drive a wrongly accused man crazy, 2016 would drive him to suicide.The film recreates the ambiance of 1996 pretty well, it didn't miss a reference to Bill Gates, to the Macarena or the VHS, but Eastwood's best accomplishment is to use familiar material for a rather unusual and so compelling character. And Jewell is never too predictable and has his satisfying moments, he might be a law-abiding citizen but when he's told to sign a document, his immediate reflex is to call his lawyer. There are moments where Watson Bryant asks him why he's so cooperative, and Paul Michael Hauser's gives a nuanced and great reaction that was overlooked by the Oscars. This is a man who's losing all his boundaries and is much aware that everything points against it and he can't help it, he cooperates because he wants to believe in his principles and if you watch his greatest moment carefully, he doesn't dismiss the system as much as he uses it to his advantage: yes, no clues, no case.""Jewell"" was snubbed by the Oscars except for a nomination for Bates, I wish it had paid more attention to Hauser, it's also a shame that the film triggered a whole controversy over the journalist's portrayal, but I guess we're not in 1996 anymore, people care for offended ones and hardly the heroes, but thanks to Eastwood, generations would remember Jewell, a man who did nothing special except saving lives, a man who had the makings of the hero, except the looks and nothing of a culprit, except the look again...",Richard Jewell
25,MOscarbradley,One of Eastwood's very best films.,9,1 February 2020,"In 1996 a bomb exploded at the Olympic Games in Atlanta. The FBI's prime suspect was Richard Jewell, the security guard who discovered the bomb and ""Richard Jewell"" is also the name of the superb film that Clint Eastwood has made about the case; it's one of his very best movies. Eastwood is almost ninety years old. Most men his age would be content to sit on their front porch and watch the world go by; Eastwood is a man who gets up off his ass and tries to do something about the state of the world he's living in. He cares. Politically conservative and a staunch Republican he is a great believer in 'doing the right thing', even if politically he and I wouldn't always agree on how to go about it. He's also a great director, arguably the best American director still working today.Eastwood is, as I've said before, a classicist; there are few tricks, if any, in his work. He edits his films for the maximum effect each scene can deliver, not from flashy pyrotechnics but from good dialogue and fine acting and the acting in ""Richard Jewell"" is as fine as in any Eastwood film. No-one puts a foot wrong but Paul Walter Hauser in the title role, Sam Rockwell and Kathy Bates are outstanding.Hauser is a character actor here given his chance at stardom which he grabs with both hands, (you might remember him as one of the racists in ""Blackkklansman""). In lesser hands his character, though real, might have seemed just another cliche but Hauser makes him human while Rockwell as his lawyer and Bates as his mother lift parts that in lesser hands might have fallen flat. I know they are real people but these are traditional roles frequently seen in the movies of the past. Of course, a good deal of their success is down to Eastwood who handles his material with equal degrees of humour and sentiment. This is one of the best films of the year.",Richard Jewell
26,Pjtaylor-96-138044,"Good enough, yet nothing more.",6,9 February 2020,"Clint Eastwood has, for lack of a better term, been obsessed with 'American heroism'. His past five movies have all focused around this theme, being biopics that highlight the actions of varying real-life figures. 'Richard Jewell (2019)' follows along with that semi-strict formula. It's about a blue-collar man wrongly accused of planting a bomb. Yet, for all its shots of the American flag, the affair is far less jingoistic than you may expect. In fact, the FBI is the closest thing it has to an antagonist, acting alongside the media in perpetuating the focal false claim. While it may have the faintest ""it's hard to be white"" (or, more specifically, ""it's hard to be a white American"") feel, it's far more interested both in the corrupt policies of the two organisations I've previously mentioned and in the too-good-at-his-job protagonist. The narrative is still relevant primarily because it focuses on 'fake news', without ever really reeking of Trump's revised meaning if the term. It's a decent ride, the majority of its time spent with its core cast of accused - or accused-adjacent - characters. The acting is good across the board, with Paul Walter Hauser playing the non-traditional protagonist with a degree of subtlety perhaps not expected with such an otherwise 'aw shucks' role. Sam Rockwell is also great. The direction is markedly good; several sequences move seamlessly from one well-composed shot to the next. Where the thing falters slightly is in its story, which feels somewhat slow and doesn't really escalate once it is fully underway. The conclusion is satisfying, though, and its text ending is (thankfully) minimal. The picture isn't boring but it isn't hugely engaging. It has its highlights, of course, but it isn't particularly exciting or gripping. However, it is generally rather enjoyable and is consistently well-conceived. In the end, it's a relatively unique yet simultaneously mundane look at a compelling 'true story'. It's good enough, but nothing more. 6/10",Richard Jewell

A heartbreaking story about a man whose life was ruined because of false reports and accusations of his involvement in the 1996 Olympic bombing.

28,Cineanalyst,"Past to Present: FBI, Media and Politics",7,12 October 2020,"Regardless of my own views on the real-world issues, I have to hand it to Clint Eastwood; nobody in Hollywood stirs the pot from the right of America's divisive politics quite as effectively as he does. Had ""Richard Jewell"" been made and released prior to the Trump administration, it would be an entirely different matter, but taking this ripped-from-the-headlines story ostensibly about the persecution by FBI agents and news media of the eponymous security guard falsely accused or suspected of complicity in the 1996 Centennial Olympic Park bombing in Atlanta and releasing it amidst more-recent news and controversies regarding the FBI and Mueller investigations into Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. elections and links to the campaign and administration of now-President Donald Trump is a loaded political act. While the release of the movie during the impeachment of the President was, I assume, a happy accident for the filmmakers, I also assume Eastwood knew very well what he was doing in obliquely recalling current or recent events by telling a two-decades-old story. In a sense, then, ""Richard Jewell"" becomes a right-wing alternative to, say, the left-wing ""The Post"" (2017), another picture suggesting a commentary on current events of the Trump administration by telling a story from the past, but of one that valorizes the press and admonishes a corrupt president.Otherwise, this is similar to other recent biopics in Eastwood's characteristically straightforward fashion of storytelling and, reportedly, workmanlike production habits--pictures such as ""J. Edgar"" (2011), ""American Sniper"" (2014) and ""Sully"" (2016). It especially reminds me of the latter, with the heroics of an everyman erroneously victimized by whatever organizations--""Sully"" meets, say, Eastwood talking to a chair at the Republican National Convention. At least, the climactic FBI interview here of Jewell, storming out after a dramatic movie speech aside, reportedly has more historical basis than the depiction of the National Transportation Safety Board as the baddies in ""Sully,"" let alone whatever one makes of a conversation with an invisible President Barack Obama. While the same can't be said for the controversy of the movie's unfounded implication that reporter Kathy Scruggs traded sex for the story, her character, at least, is offered a suggestion of remorse in the end and compelling characterized by Olivia Wilde. Most of the other main actors do well, too, including Paul Walter Hauser, Sam Rockwell and, in an Oscar-nominated performance, Kathy Bates. Jon Hamm, on the other hand, has an utterly thankless role as one of those unequivocal, composite-character heavies.

30,westsideschl,Unbelievable,10,1 June 2020,"Didn't expect much, but the story behind this man is just unbelievable. A security guard that discovered a bomb at Centennial Park as part of the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta is hounded by the media (supposedly up to 200 camped outside his home at one point) when the FBI & media turn him, within days, from a hero into the bomber. In part because he fit the lone bomber profile of, ""a frustrated white man, former police officer, or military, or wannabe who seeks to become a hero."" ""Atlanta Journal"" headline that started it all, ""FBI suspects 'hero' guard may have planted bomb."" His accusers are two of the most powerful forces in the world today: The U.S. government & the media.
Footnote: Eric Rudolph was arrested in 2003 after several anti-gay, anti-abortion, anti-liberal bombings. Jewell continued in law enforcement afterwards. Jewell settled out of court against many organizations that accused him except for the initial source, ""Atlanta Journal"" that was given a pass by the courts. Other excellent docudramas of a similar nature are ""The Traitor"" (a prisoner taking down the Italian/Sicilian mafia/Cosa Nostra in the '80s+) & ""Escape from Pretoria"".",Richard Jewell
31,ironhorse_iv,This movie was not quite a crown jewel. Yet it was watchable for the most part.,7,3 February 2020,"Let the games begin! This movie directed by Clint Eastwood try to reach for the gold, but it ended up with a bronze. It was alright at best. At least, the filmmakers & crew try to make a masterpiece. Based on Marie Brenner's 1997 Vanity Fair article ""American Nightmare: The Ballad of Richard Jewell"", which is included in her 2018 book 'Richard Jewell: And Other Tales of Heroes, Scoundrels, and Renegades' previously published under the title 'A Private War'. The film written by screenwriter Billy Ray tells the story of a security guard Richard Jewell (Paul Walter Hauser) being wrongly accused by a 'trial by media and the government' after finding a bomb during the 1996 Summer Olympics despite never been charged. The movie shows in detail how they could mistake him as the prime suspect for the bombing with his choice of lifestyle and his naïve pro righteous attitude. Still, I don't think he was as vast in the clueless buffoon department as the film makes it out to be. After all, in reality he was smart enough to ask his many friends and family to get him an entire team of lawyers to fight the case rather than one person Watson Bryant (Sam Rockwell). To add onto that, the film could had shown more of him fighting back against his accusers in the final act. After all, his lawyers and himself did go after a lot of people besides the FBI and the local newspaper. He won a lot of court cases. Not only that, but he fought against the toll that the case on his personal and professional life by getting married and losing some weight which the film oddly omitted. Because of that the third act felt anticlimax. The movie should had show him privately placing a rose at the Centennial Olympic Park scene where spectator Alice Hawthorne died to show that even with the improvements, he's still haunted and heart broken by the tragic event. It would had made for a more powerful ending. Sadly, we don't get that. We rarely see Richard in that way toward the event and its victims in that film besides an over the top nightmare moment where he hugged the bomb. Regardless Hauser did mostly a good job here. As for the supporting cast. Kathy Bates as Richard's mother Bobi was great. Lots of well-acted emotional moments. There is no wonder why she was nominated for best supporting actress at that year Academy Awards. The only nitpick I have with her portrayal is the fact that they didn't show that Bobbi limping as her character just go foot surgery at the time in real-life. Then there is Rockwell who I have to say did a wonderful performance. Some of the best moments yet funny in the film were the interactive between his client and himself; especially during the FBI raid sequence. As for the antagonists. I don't think the film need two cartoony level villainous individuals to represent the media and the government. Jon Hamm as FBI agent Tom Shaw & Olivia Wilde as Atlanta reporter Kathy Scruggs were too over the top. Especially if one of them is based on a real person. For a movie about media unjustly demonizing a real person. The filmmakers really seem like hypocrites with how Scruggs is portrayed. Don't get me wrong, we don't know for sure if she really did sleep around to get information, but I hardly doubt that she would insult the victims, by hoping and praying that the murderer is interesting minutes after the tragedy. To add onto that, I can't see her in real life breaking in a lawyer's car to get a scoop. That was too much. They made her seem like the devil. Plus, her redemption story comes a little too far in the movie. Honestly, the film could had done better if they made the media & the law enforcement faceless. It would had given more off this 'me against the world' feeling. While the film was never meant to be apolitical. Considering the well-known conservative views of Clint Eastwood, it's not hard to look at the story as an allegory for the President Donald Trump who the time of release was going through an impeachment process in 2019. Also, the fact that the real-life bomber crimes like targeting lesbian bars and abortion clinics aren't mentioned in the film. Makes it seem like this movie was made for certain key viewers rather than general audiences. No wonder why it bombed at the box office. It didn't help that the movie is highly predictable as it show that clearly as day that Jewell didn't planted the device in the park. There was no suspense or mystery. Another problem is that the movie didn't know how if it wanted to recreation news footage or use old archives. It was very jarring to see real life Richard Jewell talk to Kathy Couric only for later in the film to see Rockwell as Watson talk to an actor playing Bryant Gumbel. It made for a very confusing watch. Overall: While, originally, Jonah Hill and Leonardo DiCaprio were going to play Jewell and his attorney. I still think I like the final product. It's not Clint Eastwood's best movie, but it's far from being his worst.",Richard Jewell

He has to to fight for the truth and to prove that he wasn't the terrorist.I liked this movie very much because it is based on the fight of an individual person who instead of being considered as a hero the police and the press not only consider him as a suspect but also as a terrorist. The direction which was made by Clint Eastwood was for one more time simply magnificent. The interpretations of both Paul Walter Hauser who played as Richard Jewell and Sam Rockwell who played as Watson Bryant were simply amazing. Some other interpretations that have to be mentioned were Kathy Bates's who played as Bobi Jewell, Jon Hamm's who played as Tom Shaw and Olivia Wilde's who played as Kathy Scruggs, they were all very good and they gave a different touch in this movie.

Richard enlists attorney Bryant (Sam Rockwell) to help him through this chaos with the media saying he is responsible and the FBI believing he did it.The plot is good. Being based on a true story. Kind of upsetting that the FBI wasted most of their time attacking Richard thinking he was involved. The media adding a lot of fuel to those assumptions. Richard is a goody good guy who wants to help people. He may be too honest with answering law enforcement.The performances are great in the movie. Especially the main character. The script delivered with this storytelling. Showing Richard being acclaimed as a hero. And the downfall with FBI and the media attacking him so quick.

36,zkonedog,Suffers From An Utter Lack Of Nuance And Tact,3,14 December 2019,"Almost a year ago to the day that I sit down to write this review, I saw ""The Mule"" in theaters and was embarrassed/saddened by how out-of-touch Clint Eastwood seemed to have become in telling a viable story on-screen. I was hoping that keeping him behind the camera for ""Richard Jewell"" would help matters, and the trailers really pulled me in. Sadly, this film is only a slight step above ""The Mule"" in terms of overall effectiveness at conveying a story.For a very basic overview, this film tells the story of Richard Jewell (Paul Walter Hauser), a security worker affiliated with the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta who diagnosed a bomb scare and helped clear the scene to avoid larger destruction. While initially hailed as a hero, Jewell is eventually investigated by the FBI as a prime suspect in the bombing, as well as excoriated/harassed by the media.I'll say this right off the bat: there is no doubt that Jewell was mistreated by many parties throughout this entire ordeal. Those relevant parties have even admitted as such. He did a heroic thing and had his life turned into a living hell because of it. There is certainly an interesting story to be told within that set of circumstances.Unfortunately, Clint Eastwood is no longer the person to tell that story, and (once again) it really shows here. Instead of a nuanced look at how the media, authorities, and individuals can/should interact with each other, we instead get a piece that embarrassingly vilifies journalists/media to almost cartoonish proportions, and gives the same basic treatment to the federal authorities. This is in contrast to Jewell's lawyer, Watson Bryant (Sam Rockwell), who is largely portrayed as the benevolent hero of the piece.Clearly, the main theme of ""Richard Jewell"" is that the media (or those possessing power in general) can spin the narrative any way they want. While this is true, to a certain extent, it needs a more nuanced, tactful touch. Another wholly probably explanation is that the authorities did indeed suspect Jewell and want to investigate him, and the media felt compelled to cover the store. Does that justifying Jewell's hounding? Of course not, but that's where the nuance comes in (or doesn't, in this case).The most embarrassing character of the whole thing is Kathy Scruggs (Olivia Wilde), an Atlanta newspaper reporter who might as well be Cruella de Vil through Eastwood's lens. Much criticism has come from the Atlanta-Journal Constitution (Scrugg's employer at the time) over the portrayal, and I can see why. Unless she was a true monster, this performance borders on libel. Sadly, I don't trust Eastwood to make that distinction anymore, either.The only character that truly seemed ""real"" in the entire movie was Jewell's mother Bobi (Kathy Bates), as that was the only character given any true humanity. All the other participants are pastiches, lacking any real-world substance or the conflicts that all individuals face. In Eastwood's world, you are either a ""good guy"" or a ""bad guy"", and there's absolutely no middle ground.The bottom line here is that until Eastwood gets away from making films about true-life ""hero"" stories, this is exactly the type of fare we'll get again and again. No depth, no humanity, just over-the-top characterizations that fit into his own strict worldview. I came into the theater expecting very little of ""Richard Jewell"" based on my ""Mule"" experience, and it still managed to disappoint.",Richard Jewell
37,eddie_baggins,A watchable but uninspired true life drama,6,31 March 2020,"Continuing on his late career charge towards telling the stories of seemingly every day American's in out of the ordinary situations, Clint Eastwood doesn't mess with his modus operandi with his latest based on a true life tale Richard Jewell.Directing this stoic tale with as little flair or effort as possible, Eastwood's examination of Jewell's headline making act of bravery, turned headline making life as a lead suspect as a potential terrorist is an always watchable exercise that features a career best turn from its main actor Paul Walter Hauser but it's an experience that you wish was able to deliver something a little more.A timely exploration of the way media can impact our lives and also the lives of the individuals it chooses to shove into the spotlight, Jewell feels like a relevant cinematic exercise and also one that wisely chooses too focus on an event that in many ways time has forgot, but you can't help but feel Eastwood's insistence on getting film's wrapped as quickly as possible stops Jewell from evolving into the film it could've been.With a loaded supporting cast including the Oscar nominated Kathy Bates, whose as good as she's been in year's as Jewell's kindly mother Bobi, and the likes of Sam Rockwell, Jon Hamm and Olivia Wilde in her controversial and poorly written role as journalist Kathy Scruggs, Jewell has the star power and foundation to be a very strong prestige drama but Eastwood isn't interested in making this film as he instead pushes forward with a drama 101 operation.There's nothing overtly bad about Eastwood's effort, an effort than in many ways show's more refinement than The Mule and also marks a major step up in quality over the dire The 15:17 to Paris but there's just the feeling of acceptance for the middle ground as Jewell's intriguing story plays out before our eyes.With minimal big moments, a sparsely used score and barely a moment of inventiveness in a directional sense, Jewell marks further occasion where age has clearly wearied one of the industries hardest working and most well-respected figures, as the twilight of his career appears to be well and truly upon us as Jewell acts as a watchable new entry into Eastwood's impressive filmography but one that won't be remembered in the months let alone years soon to come.Final Say -An intriguing story that's well acted yet played out in an unfussy and unimaginative fashion, Richard Jewell is a solid drama that never tries to be anything else or anything worth remembering once the credits have finished rolling.3 Tupperware items out of 5",Richard Jewell

Clint Eastwood does achieve in making the character Richard Jewell come to life, because at the beginning he looks like a fat, dumb wit, who perhaps (for a second) could even be dumb enough to be a terrorist, BUT at the end of the movie I have grown to love Richard Jewell, WITH all his weird and clumsy characteristics. Only Richard Jewell's performance is true to life and fascinating though, the other characters are cardboard and flat and are only there to propel this story forward. I dont get it (for a minute) that people say that Kathy Bates or someone else deserves an Oscar. Ridiculous.

This movie is based on a true story from a 1990 article that was written by Marie Brenner, a journalist. It is directed by Clint Eastwood. It's the story of a security guard that saved a lot of lives from a bomb but was vilified by the press and the F.B.I. as being the bomber/terrorist that was responsible. It happened at the 1996 Olympics, held in Atlanta, Georgia. Paul plays the hero/terrorist, Richard Jewell. Sam is his lawyer and Kathy is his mother. Olivia is the reporter that breaks the story that changes Paul from hero to terrorist and Jon is the F.B.I. agent that is intent on getting the bomber responsible-he is convinced that it's Paul. He always respected the police and was wanting to be in the law enforcement field, in one capacity or another, which only made it hard for him to think people could ever think he was a bad guy. Everyone does a great job but Paul is really amazing to watch. There is insight as to who was responsible for the bombing-at the end of the movie-as well as to what happened to everyone after the events depicted in the movie.

The hero of the 1996 Olympic park bombing, Jewell was at first lionized then slandered and vilified by what in this day and age has become the usual suspects, The FBI and media. Directed by Clint Eastwood, it is a somber but chilling telling of when respected goes rogue that is having the same disturbing effect today as the same apparatus sets its sights on someone higher than a security guard.Eastwood's sometime lethargic direction remains controlled and unsensationalized throughout as his protagonist lummox (movingly played by Paul Walter Hauser) is picked at by easily corrupted FBI agent Tom Shaw (Jon Hamm) and a sleazy reporter Kathy Scruggs (Olivia Wilde) willing to go the extra mile for a scoop. Impeding the runaway justice Jewell's lawyer Watson Bryant (Sam Rockwell) corrects the sloppy ambitions without grandstanding, tempering his rage at institutions in railroading mode while maintaining a balancing act dynamic of Lenny and George from Of Mice and Men with Jewell.Outside of the moments from the bombing attack, Richard Jewell is mostly a drawing room drama filmed in banal, lugubrious settings with the occasional flock of abrasive reporters. The story commands attention however, especially in these ""interesting times"" where media has completely ignored its bedrock pledge to objectivity, shamelessly taking sides while rogue agents at the FBI are getting pink slips.

46,CubsandCulture,Asinine Libertarianism gets in the way of a good story,7,5 January 2020,"This is a well crafted legal procedural that has all the hallmarks of Eastwood's best films. The cinematic qualities are pushed into extreme minimalism and naturalism. The acting is alive and poignant. Bates and Rockwell, especially, give very touching performances. The film is recreation of a historical event, that in itself, is interesting. On the basic level of engagement this is mostly an unqualified success. Scruggs, as written, is an overcooked character and she doesn't really fit tonally into the film. The portrayal is ahistoric (which is a huge irony within the film) but even apart from that I don't buy the character as written.Scruggs is pushed in this direction because Eastwood and Ray (screenwriter) put a lot of libertarian junk into this story. It doesn't really fit and it is contradictory anyway. You can almost see Eastwood's mind shatter trying to square the circle between this being a cautionary tale of police overreach with Jewell wanting to be a cop. I half-expected Bryant to go on an rant about the imposition doctrine. The film seems to think, laughably, that college professors are a greater danger to liberty than (state) police. It is all is hard to parse and make coherent because these political obsessions don't really belong here.Richard Jewell is enough of a cautionary tale of criminal justice overreach and trying people in the court of public opinion that these elements did not need to be slanted towards libertarianism.",Richard Jewell

51,jimbo-53-186511,A jewel indeed...,8,8 May 2021,"After reporting a suspicious bag which is later discovered to be a bomb security guard Richard Jewell is branded a hero for being integral in saving thousands of lives by instigating an evacuation. However, Richard's world ends up turned upside down when the FBI suspect that he is the man responsible for planting the bomb. It seems that Richard's only hope in helping to prove his innocence lies with his former friend and lawyer Watson Bryant...Being English I have to admit that I wasn't overly familiar with this event from 1996 (although naturally I can imagine it was huge news in America). Therefore it was a film that caught my interest when I looked at the subject matter and I'm glad that it was as good as I hoped it would be...Its main premise focuses on something which is a big pet peeve of mine and that is the callous way that the press report that someone is guilty of something based on mere 'hearsay.' It's odd but I always thought that someone is innocent until proven guilty, but in this case poor Richard was guilty until proven innocent. This sort of thing happens far too often and ruins so many people's lives and quite frankly it's despicable and I do think that some sort of law should brought in to protect innocent people's names from being dragged through the mud until they have been proven to be guilty. Anyway I'll get off my soapbox now and crack on with the review...What may disappoint some people about this film is that it is perhaps a tad unassuming and perhaps even a bit unshowy and to an extent I agree. However, I think when a film has interesting subject matter such as this that Eastwood can just let the story flow and with the right actors he can essentially add meat to the bones. Aside from the explosion, there are no really big showstopping moments yet the film is still involving and intriguing complete with characters who are both appalling and endearing.What anchors the film is the superb performance by Paul Walter Hauser (who I have to admit I was unfamiliar with before watching this film); he does a wonderful job of sympathetically portraying a man who was just doing his job and ultimately placing too much trust in those who he idolizes and whom should be there to protect him. Olivia Wilde's confident and sassy performance was also a big plus and Jon Hamm's sleazy FBI agent also deserves some recognition.The only minor flaw with this film lies with the investigative side of things which ultimately felt a bit thin. Having said that it is a testament to Eastwood that he managed to make the film compelling enough merely based on Jewell & Bryant's journey in doing everything they can to clear Jewell's name. As I said Richard Jewell is a jewel indeed.",Richard Jewell
52,Pairic,A Powerful Human Drama,9,1 February 2020,"Richard Jewell: The media are fickle, they will make into a hero but the next day they will destroy your life. Richard Jewell (Paul Walter Hauser) was a security guard at a concert during the 1996 Atlanta Olympics. He discovered a bomb and helped clear the area before it exploded. Two people died in the blast but many more would have perished if it hadn't been for his alertness. At first he is hailed as a hero but then a former employer holding a grudge suggests to the FBI that Richard might have planted the bomb. The nightmare begins. Olivia Wild plays a reporter who sleeps with an FBI Agent to get the story on Jewell (the real life journalist denies this). She writes a story which portrays Richard as a terrorist, she even hides in the back of Richard's lawyer's (Sam Rockwell) car to try and get more information She is a narcissist but not delusional, she gets the stories that makes the front page.Director Clint Eastwood working from a screenplay by Billy Ray lets this tale unfold at a measured pace. Richard is eccentric, obsessive in his attention to detail but has also lost two law enforcement jobs to his inability to let minor things go. The scenes where this is revealed are carefully crafted. Richard is literally an innocent abroad who will incriminate himself if he opens his mouth. The predatory nature of Wilde is revealed in one shot where the shadows from blinds give her tiger stripes on her face.

54,masonfisk,EASTWOOD DOES ANOTHER REAL PERSON PROUD...!,9,22 January 2020,"Clint Eastwood is at it again w/another true life tale (coming on the heels of American Sniper, Sully, The 15:17 to Paris, J. Edgar) this time focusing on Richard Jewell, a security guard who discovered a bomb during the 1996 Olympics games in Atlanta. Always wanting to be a policeman but for whatever reason never making it stick, Jewell ended up being a rent-a-cop conducting his duties in a professional manner (w/the singular mantra of respecting the law being his guidepost). In one episode he chases some kids off who're causing some trouble but discovers a mysterious package under a bench which being the consummate pro that he is, calls in legitimate authorities to handle the situation. The bomb did go off but due to his efforts (more people could've been hurt) he becomes a hero (something his mother played by Kathy Bates dotes on) but when the FBI (led by a single-minded Jon Hamm) & an untoward investigative journalist (played by Olivia Wilde), the kind that accuses first & apologizes later, make accusations that Jewell may've been the bomber all along (his background skews him into the category), an attorney (played w/hilarious indignation by Sam Rockwell), an old acquaintance of Jewell, steps in to defend him. Putting the notion of hero in large flashing lights, its definition is soon put to the test as we see Jewell become the toast of the town only to have the rug ripped out from under him just as quickly. Paul Walter Hauser essays the role like a champ (he also played the bumbling crowbar hitter in I, Tonya) all 'gees"" & 'goshes' until he learns the hard way not everyone is on his side.",Richard Jewell
55,dierregi,Classic film-making at its best,7,21 January 2020,"In this era of blatant manipulation, political correctness and hypocrite scripts it is so refreshing, to watch a classic plot brilliantly executed.Based on real events, Hauser plays Richard Jewell, a security officer who found a bomb during the Atlanta Olympics. Despite having helped saving lives, Jewell ended up as the prime (and only) suspect, in a most sloppy FBI investigation.Due to some past minor misdemeanours and bad- from a past employer, Richard got ""profiled"" as a classic, Caucasian, lonely bomber. Without a shred of evidence, the FBI, in the person of despicable Tom Shaw, launched out to frame him.Shaw does not know the meaning of ""conflict of interest"" and spills his gut to equally despicable female muckraker Kathy Scruggs. Once the gutter press gets a hint of Jewell's being ""person of interest"", his normal life is over.Enter Watson Bryant (the always outstanding Rockwell), as Jewell's attorney and you can start hoping some justice will be had.Most terrifying cautionary tale about the corrosive, destructive power of the media, who mistakes the ""right to inform"" with the ""freedom to spread malignant, unsubstantiated lies"".Not as gloomy as it may sound, mostly thanks to Rockwell. Hauser is brilliant, too, with his quiet rage.",Richard Jewell
56,valleyjohn,Great performanve from Hauser,8,28 March 2020,"Never particularly look forward to watching a Clint Eastwood directed movie . I'm not sure why? . Perhaps it's because , in my head , they seem to be a little bit ""Flag waving "" but when I think about it they really aren't and yet again , after being reluctant to see one of his films , I really liked What I saw .
During the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, security guard Richard Jewell discovers a suspicious backpack under a bench in Centennial Park. With little time to spare, he helps to evacuate the area until the incendiary device inside the bag explodes. Hailed as a hero who saved lives, Jewell's own life starts to unravel when the FBI names him the prime suspect in the bombing.
The first question I have to ask is why didn't Paul Walter Hauser get a best actor nomination for this performance? He is quite outstanding as Jewell. Kathy Bates was nominated and although it's a good performance it doesn't compare to his.
This very much has the feel of Sully about it . The Heroic character who goes from hero to zero because authorities are looking for someone to blame to save their own arses . You can't help but get caught up in Richard Jewell's story and I feel so sorry for what he had to endure but because of The way he as I'm not sure he ever felt sorry for himself.
The story is a gently told and you can really tell it's an Eastwood movie . It's the sort of film everyone could enjoy without having to put up with gratuitous swearing or any blood and gore , despite the circumstances of the story .
I'm not sure how much longer the great man can keep making films but I hope this isn't the last work we have seen from him .",Richard Jewell
57,truemythmedia,Underappreciated Film,8,7 January 2020,"Clint Eastwood (""Gran Torino,"" 2008) is a hit or miss director for me. His style is often a bit more detached from the subject for my liking, which is saying a lot for a reviewer like me who enjoys his slow Bergman, Bresson, and Tarkovsky films. I think because Eastwood tends to be slow and process focused rather than using detachment to drive introspection, I often think his films are a little longer than they need to be, spending time on scenes and facts that, in my opinion, could be removed from the movie all together.""Richard Jewell"" is no exception to this tendency but it is less of an offender than many of his other films. On the whole, I enjoyed the film far more than I thought I might. The main draw for me was the lead performer Paul Walter Hauser (""I, Tonya,"" 2017). He was definitely the comic relief in ""I, Tonya"" so I was intrigued to see him do something dramatic, especially as the lead who has to carry the heart of a film.On top of that interest, I remember the bombing at the Olympic Games but only just. I was still pretty young and didn't understand or follow any of the aftermath so, depending on how accurate the film ended up being, this seemed like it would scratch the old fill-in-the-blanks-of-my-childhood-memory itch.I couldn't be more pleased with this film. It answered all my piqued interest and then some. First off, Hauser blew me away with his nuanced performance that never strayed so far into cliche' acceptance or aversion that it fell off the tightrope necessary to feel like a real character but not just a stereo-typically written one. I can't stress enough how much I appreciated this. In a day where I could see either side of our overly politicized division claiming the character as either a 'True American Every-man Hero' or a 'Militaristic Incel White Failure to Launch Ignoramus,' Jewell was portrayed, instead, as a real person who had many cliche' signposts in his life but is also a really good person, even if he seems incredibly socially obtuse. Sort of the way most real people are. There are a lot of things about me that most people would chalk up to me being a white male but if they assume that is all there is to me, they are making a big mistake. That is sort of the lesson of ""Richard Jewell."" A lot of people assume some things about him until they get to know him and realize who he really is.For the most part, Paul Walter Hauser is leading an all star cast turning in great performances. Jon Hamm (""Baby Driver,"" 2017) is OK, though he isn't given much to work with. Sam Rockwell (""Three Billboards..."" 2017) and Kathy Bates (""Misery,"" 1990) however, deliver stand out performances that really draw out the other characters in a way that doesn't grab the spotlight but still dives deep enough into their characters to move you.The one sorry spot in this cast is Olivia Wilde (""Tron Legacy,"" 2019) as the reporter going after Jewell. I'm not sure if this is just the writing of the character or the over the top way she chose to perform it, but, in a movie that is all about not assuming things about Richard Jewell simply because he fits a profile, this film relies on cliche' and over the top straw-person tactics to take down a 'biased news woman' who'll do, screw, or say anything to get a front page story. It's a shame that the film isn't as fair to her as Jewell.Those are my nitpicks though and I'll stress nitpicks. Other than being a little longer by a scene or two than I felt was necessary and a poorly written journalist character this movie is more than worth your time if you have an interest in the bombing, the main actor, or just a good story about our prejudices and how we have to fight the temptation to judge without firsthand knowledge of those we are judging.",Richard Jewell

59,AudioFileZ,Eastwood Keeps Bringing Us Compelling Stories of Real People,8,27 December 2019,"Clint Eastwood continues his films looking into real life tragic figures. People who have faults like all of us, but find themselves in very unsettling extraordinary horrific events. Eastwood has become quite un-Hollywood and unapologetic as he tackles stories more in an indie style of bare-bones filmmaking. While being sympathetic he also indicts his subjects. In the case of Richard Jewell it's his naïveté and zeal for his place in the justice system which, sadly, put him in the crosshairs. Hauser as Jewell is excellent in his simplicity. None of us knew Jewell, but by the end of the movie we feel as if we did. Anyone who has watched a panoply of crime and justice shows should be primed for the Jewell story. Big law enforcement not following where concrete evidence goes instead seeking to make a case as it suits a canned narrative built on pre-conceived hunches. It can get out of hand destroying the truth in this case leaving a destroyed innocent life. You'll know how Eastwood feels about this tragedy plain and simple. The key performances (Hauser, Rockwell, Ham, Bates, and Wilde) are all spot-on making a humble film rise up for a final word . I think many millions will agree the grave injustice thrust on Richard Jewell is a story that needs to be remembered...and learned from.

61,jadepietro,Fake News Well Served,8,17 December 2019,"GRADE: BTHIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: Skillfully directed and acted, this well-made film becomes the equivalent of fake news loosely based of a true incident.JIM'S REVIEW: We live in very polarizing times and Clint Eastwood's bio-pic, Richard Jewell, is a very polarizing film to some moviegoers. The film may be based on events that happened in 1996, but all of the talk about quid pro quo (over a far-fetched gift of a Snickers bar, no less) or the depiction of the deep state FBI investigations and the reckless media's stalwart coverage are as relevant as today's headlines, a fact that just might be Mr. Eastwood's sole intent for his film. Mr. Eastwood serves his right-wing propaganda piping hot, with broad strokes of black and white and very little grey tonality in-between. His then vs. now prosecution of our nation's rush to judgment is loosely based on historical events, but his behind-the-scenes retelling is pure fabrication.The director deliberately blurs the line between fact and fiction to tell his story of a wronged man maligned by the press, law enforcement agencies, and the American public, while he either purposely maligns other real-life supporting characters or invents other fictitious catalysts as his corroborating evidence.That said, Mr. Eastwood has made an absorbing and effective piece of filmmaking with excellent production values and he keeps the action moving at a brisk pace. He also populates his film with fine acting. In a breakout role, Paul Walter Hauser makes the accused title character tragic and quite sympathetic. Physically a spot-on doppelgänger with the real life Mr. Jewell, the actor conveys his naiveté and earnestness to a fault. Sharing the spotlight are a winning Sam Rockwell as his attorney and the remarkable Kathy Bates as Jewell's doting mother, Bobi. Both actors are in top form.For those unaware of the incident: During the 1996 Olympics, an Atlanta security guard discovers a terrorist plot and goes from hero to suspect during the FBI investigation and subsequent news coverage. His life is turned upside down by the media blitz and America's insatiable thirst for scandal. Afterwards, numerous lawsuits were filed to clear his name.Billy Ray's screenplay adaptation has many strong emotional moments but the subject deserves a more evenly researched treatment. The character of real life reporter Kathy Scrugg, played by Olivia Wilde, has become a controversial figure in the film as she seen as procuring her story by sexual means channeling Faye Dunaway ala Network while Jon Hamm's FBI agent, Tom Shaw, is all fabrication. This roles are broadly written as primary villains instead of two-dimensional characters, which dissipates the overall impact of the film. Even the character of Mr. Jewell, as written, bounces uneasily from savvy law enforcement expert to dim-witted yokel to unfortunate victim, despite Mr. Hauser's effective interpretation of the role. Still, the film tells its story of a foiled terrorist plot and the media circus that followed most compellingly.Although Mr. Eastwood seems more interested in assuming the role as whistleblower than director, Richard Jewell is a well-crafted film that may resonate with many moviegoers, depending about their own political viewpoints. Its message is easily heard and its cry against injustice is powerful, but its sound and fury remains loud if rather unclear.",Richard Jewell

63,burlesonjesse5,VIEWS ON FILM review of Richard Jewell,8,14 December 2019,"""You're a suspect, you don't talk."" Any moviegoer would be ""suspect"" if they didn't at least check out 2019's Richard Jewell. Along with Dark Waters and The Irishman, ""Jewell"" is one of the best films of this year being based on a true-life article (or book).Richard Jewell, while looking more proficient instead of being unnecessarily flashy, is a sledgehammering account of persecution, a well cast drama, and a thorough biopic to boot.In truth, if you like Clint Eastwood movies based on true stories (Sully, American Sniper, Changeling), then ""Jewell"" will keep your cinematic playing field level. And if you demand an impeccable sense of time and place (summer in Atlanta circa 1996), then Richard Jewell will put you right there nervously singing the tune ""Macarena"".Produced by Leonardo DiCaprio (yes that Leo) and distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures (most Clint Eastwood flicks are), ""Jewell"" chronicles the Centennial Olympic Park Bombing via the '96 Summer Olympics. A security guard working there (Richard Jewell) discovers a bomb and alerts authorities only to be accused of planting the darn thing himself.Edited cleanly in time lines, easy to follow, and devoid of any major glitz, Richard Jewell runs 129 minutes with hand-held director Paul Greengrass originally on board to helm. I'm kinda glad Eastwood took over the project. Greengrass is more of a jittery, elusive action guy as opposed to being a one-take regulator like Clint Eastwood. ""Jewel's"" diegesis might not be fast-paced enough for good old Paulie.All in all, the best things about ""Jewell"" are Eastwood's tireless attention to detail, his standardized yet streamlined direction, and his actors who are perfect for their roles (Paul Walter Hauser as Jewell, Jon Hamm as FBI agent Tom Shaw, and Kathy Bates as Jewell's emotionally distraught mom).I remember saying in 2018 that Clint Eastwood needed to better his faulty directorial decisions and take his time more (that was in regards to The 15:17 to Paris). With Richard Jewell, I guess he heeded my advice. Rating: 3 and a half stars.",Richard Jewell
64,justin-fencsak,Great movie about a forgotten legend,8,30 March 2020,"Many people know about Richard Jewell, the hero who helped find a bomb and warned Olympians and the fans about the explosion that was to come and delayed the games in 1996. What many did not know is what happened next, as Jewell was falsely accused of that incident believing he was the bomber only to find out that Eric Rudolph was the bomber that planted the bomb inside a backpack under a bench during that fateful summer day. The reason this movie failed at the box office was because of the depiction of Kathy Scaggs, the female reporter who sensationalized the story into national headlines, by Olivia Wilde in a decent performance. Jon Hamm does a good job playing as the FBI agent and a newcomer plays Jewell as a fat gun loving video game arcade fanatic who has health issues and died in 2007. Clint Eastwood has done it again, after the success of the Mule after a mishap with that Paris movie after the successes of American Sniper and Sully not to mention Gran Turino as well as his Oscar winning movie Million Dollar Baby and Mystic River, to name a few. He is still going strong as he approaches 90 years as a good man. Highly recommended for a rental.",Richard Jewell

The people there began to be withdrawn from the place but the package bomb explloded meanwhile killing two people and injuring many others, However it could have been much worse if it were not for Jewell's alert He was considered a hero for having thus saved many lives. However he was turned into a suspect of having put the bomb there to fake his hero figure afterwards.

On account of being in lock-down because of the virus. I noticed that the TV series Manhunt was also featuring this story. This movie wasn't anything like I was expecting, at least politically speaking. I thought Eastwood was going to put most of the blame down on the press for screwing this up as badly as it was. Instead, he blamed the FBI for being way too eager to pin the case on such a hapless tub of guts.It's not as if the press didn't have a lot to answer for regarding this case as well as many others, but it was the FBI who turned justice on its ear with Jewell (who died of heart disease at 44).",Richard Jewell

71,Jeremy_Urquhart,Another solid entry in Eastwood's huge filmography,7,4 March 2020,"It'll be a sad day for the film world when Clint Eastwood eventually passes. It might well shake the world in a similar way to how Bowie's death did, because neither artist has really slowed down with age. Sure, Bowie's 21st century output didn't really rival some of the best stuff he put out in the 1970s, and with Eastwood, it's hard to imagine him making another film quite as great as Unforgiven, or delivering a performance as iconic as the ones he gave in The Dollars Trilogy or Dirty Harry. But, the man turns 90 in just a few months, and for all the middling reviews his more recent movies sometimes get, I still think he's going incredibly strong all things considered. Additionally, I have a ton of respect for the man being able to direct a movie as good as Richard Jewell at such an old age.Richard Jewell is quite a simple movie, and it isn't one that I can see blowing too many people away. It's clean, direct, and well constructed, without being too challenging. This may harm how well the movie sticks in my mind in the coming weeks, months, or even years, and I don't imagine it's one that I'll feel a deep desire to rewatch any time soon (there's so much out there; life's too short to rewatch merely good movies sometimes).Essentially, what we have is a film about a man who performs a heroic deed by saving numerous people from a bomb attack. He is then held as a hero, yet shortly after vilified as a suspect, because both the government and the media wanted to pin the blame on somebody, (supposedly because they didn't want anyone thinking that either weren't doing their jobs.) That's the understanding I get from the movie. Having known nothing about the real life case (it happened when I was 1 year old, but my dad remembers it vividly, and we live on the other side of the world to America), I can only assume that it's not 100% factually accurate. But the story in its most basic form is there, with a couple of messages coming from it. The first and most obvious is less interesting, because it boils down to how falsely accusing somebody without due process can ruin their lives. Other films have tackled this before, but the secondary message is more interesting: if heroes like Jewell are vilified, others in similar situations in the future will feel less inclined to go out of their way to help, so they avoid the risk of getting a trial by media the way Jewell did. It would have been easier for Jewell in hindsight to stand back, and keep quiet, or simply save himself. The lives of others may have been on his conscience, but he would not have been vilified within the media, and had many areas of his and his mother's lives ruined in the process.While the writing, direction, and overall look of the film are all solid, it's the acting that is probably the only area where Richard Jewell truly excels. I'm not too familiar with Paul Walter Hauser, and I think it's a shame that he's not billed first on the credits, but I'm going to remember him after this film because he did a great job. Sam Rockwell and Kathy Bates were also very good, and honestly I'm starting to think that the sleazier the character Jon Hamm plays, the better he is. If you want to see one of last year's overall best acted films, this is honestly a good one to watch, because the cast is as a whole is very strong.To cover a few flaws, in order to explain why this can't quite get to an 8/10 or higher in my books: I think it's overall about 10-15 minutes too long. A few scenes here and there getting trimmed to keep the running time at just under 2 hours would have certainly helped the film's pacing, although that being said, it doesn't feel too long at 131 minutes. It's a pretty minor flaw, admittedly. There's also a brief dream sequence where Jewell has a flashback to the bombing incident, and it was pretty cheesy and overall pointless, and the ending I had mixed feelings on too. It seemed like the writer wasn't sure when to stop the movie, and when to start the biography-standard epilogue told through title cards. There's one brief scene near the end that seemed like it could have been told less awkwardly with a title card, for example. Also, I wondered whether the movie might have been more interesting if we were given less information about whether Jewell did it or not. Showing the attack directly from his perspective lets us know he didn't plant the bomb, but it could have been an entirely different (and maybe more interesting) movie if we as an audience were placed more in the dark during the post-bombing investigation.So my flaws are pretty minor because overall, Richard Jewell does everything pretty well, except for the acting, which it does extremely well. Clint Eastwood did a really god job here, and once again, I have to stress that I'm so happy he's still making movies that I can go see in a movie theatre. I have been and always will be a huge Eastwood fan, and so I feel pretty good when I come away from his movies as satisfied as I was with Richard Jewell. It's not a must-watch at theatres, but I can certainly give it a strong recommendation when it comes onto streaming services.",Richard Jewell

For one thing, given how it's shot, it's obvious from the start that Jewell is innocent. Quite frankly I think I'm among the majority who didn't remember who was guilty, so the ""suspense"" angle is killed right off the bat. OK. So the story is about how badly the media and the FBI acted. I can go along with that. But then when the film is over they t ell us what happened to Jewell, his mother, and the lawyer. Nothing about the two FBI agents and the reporter who caused Jewell and his mom all this grief. Surely if the film is about the conduct of the FBI and the media, the post-script should have told us about them. With a post script I would have given the film a much higher rating",Richard Jewell

76,educallejero,Morally corrupt but fun... kind of,5,9 January 2020,"Clint Eastwood (and Hollywood) doesn't even try to hide his bias. He presents the story without any interest of achieving impartiality (or even trying). And I'm not even talking about ""what happened"" because I didn't have any idea when I watched it. But at the time I spot a brutal obvious lie (about Kathy Scruggs), essential to the message and theme of the movie, that I confirmed later.That's it? A lie ruins a movie? No. But if you add that the rest of the facts presented are all tinted of the same bias (even if those aren't lies per se), presented with embarrassing sentimentalism trying to force a perspective of every single act, clear overacting in the same direction (Wilde and Hamm), several boring segments (mostly in the first act) and the insufferable Kathy Bates, we have a super flawed movie. In the end, if the idea was to criticize the elite and corporate media, Joker (2019) did it already in the same year and better in every single way. So it's not even original.The good: Sam Rockwell and Paul Hauser (perfect in ""I, Tonya"") are amazing and even making realistic scenes they make you laugh (or chuckle). When they have to make emotional/dramatic scenes, they nail it perfectly too. Great. The other thing, the humor.

Richard Jewell is a great true story of American injustice, and as a feature, it kicks some butt. A tragic story of a flawed, yet well-intentioned rent-a-cop who became a suspect of a bombing that he tried to stop from happening. It's engrossing, riveting and tense. More than what Eastwood has given us, at lease since Sully. Paul Walter Hauser practically is Richard Jewell. You couldn't have landed better casting if you tried. Kathy Bates and Sam Rockwell both bring it as well. My main problem with Jewell, however, is it's glaring embellishments.

78,rockman182,Richard Jewell (2019),7,15 December 2019,"Clint Eastwood has been hit or miss for many years with the latter years of his career being more miss than hit. I did really like The Mule, which was his latest effort. It was funny and engaged the viewers. The story of Richard Jewell is one that I did not know about but I was willing to check it out and see if Eastwood good go on a winning streak of sorts. I'm happy to say that Richard Jewell was actually really entertaining and has a very well acted performance by Paul Walter Hauser.The film is about the true story about a security guard who located a pipe bomb in 1996 during a celebration in Atlanta's Centennial Olympic Park. While the bombing did injure around 100 people, the acts of the guard prevented more chaos. However, after the incidents the hero soon becomes the suspect as the FBI become relentless in their pursuit of Jewell being the lead suspect, despite Jewell not being involved with the crime. The film also stars Jon Hamm, Sam Rockwell, Olivia Wilde, and Kathy Bates.
Hauser is really good in this film. I liked his role in I, Tonya and he shows here he can handle a lead. Rockwell is always on form and one of my very favorites. Bates also has a rather understated but powerful role. The film does well to capture the feelings of panic after the bombing and really does a job of portraying the events that transpired. There's been controversy recently because of the negative portrayal of reporter Kathy Scruggs. I don't know if its true that the journalist was like that however her death from overdose must have been tragic, especially as it likely stemmed from the Jewell case.
I'm not sure a lot of it was as factual as it can be but Eastwood brings a very digestible and watchable effort that shows how hard it is to show innocence with circumstances look like they are going against you. After seeing the worst film of the year yesterday, I am glad to have seen something that I really liked. Clint Eastwood's directorial career lives on and feels as fresh as ever.

79,bankofmarquis,Mellow pace - nothing special,6,2 February 2020,"89 year old Director/Actor Clint Eastwood has mellowed with age. He seems at peace with himself and prefers to work at a pace that he sets. His latest Directing effort - RICHARD JEWELL - has that sort of mellowness. It takes it time to tell it's story with no real urgency to it.It could have used some life to be injected in it.Based on the true events of the pipe bombing in Centennial Park in Atlanta during the 1996 Summer Olympics, RICHARD JEWELL tells the story of...well...Richard Jewell - the Security Guard who was hailed as a hero for warning people about the bomb, saving many lives, while also being listed as the #1 suspect in the bombing.Director Eastwood and Writer Billy Ray do not spend much time making the audience guess at to whether or not they think that Jewell committed the crime (he did not - the real bomber was caught in 2006), rather they spend their time showing a person who's being railroaded by the FBI and who's life is caught up in the scramble by the press to ""get the story."" Again...this would be more interesting if Director Eastwood would show some sort of urgency to the proceedings, but this film is paced on an even keel from start to finish, and I never got caught up, emotionally, in the events that were transpiring in front of me.Paul Walter Hauser (Shawn Eckhardt in I, TONYA) does a ""fine enough"" job as the titular character - but it isn't anything special and since the viewer is spending almost every scene with him ""fine enough"" isn't good enough. Adding to my disappointment are the portrayals by John Hamm (as an FBI Agent) and Olivia Wilde (as a Newspaper Reporter). Both of these performances border on caricature (especially Wilde's performance). I'm disappointed in Eastwood for letting this happen.Injecting ""some"" life into this film is Kathy Bates - who was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her portrayal of Richard Jewell's mother - and she delivers better than the others...but not ""Oscar Worthy"". She does nail her ""Oscar moment"", but I don't think the script gives her much else to do.The brightest spot in this film - by far - is the portrayal of Richard Jewell's lawyer, Watson Bryant, by Sam Rockwell and the performance of Nina Ariande as Bryant's Secretary/Girlfriend. If anyone should have been nominated for an Oscar for their performance in this film, it is Rockwell - his is the best one in the film and Ariande plays off him wonderfully well. I sat up a little taller in my seat whenever these two had a scene together.But that's about it. It's a pretty ""meh"" movie - professionally made and paced deliberately and mellowly - like Clint Eastwood. But not like an Oscar contending film.Letter Grade: B-6 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)",Richard Jewell
80,Anurag-Shetty,Deserves so much more acclaim.,10,7 January 2020,"Richard Jewell tells the true story of US security guard, Richard Jewell(Paul Walter Hauser). Richard saves lots of lives from a bomb blast, during the 1996 Olympics. However, the FBI & the press suspect that Richard himself, might be the one responsible for the bombing.Richard Jewell is a phenomenal film. Director Clint Eastwood has given us a dramatic, emotional & feel-good movie about the titular character's journey, that is an absolute roller-coaster ride. There are generous doses of comedy too, amidst all the dramatic set pieces. One or two scenes will leave you teary-eyed. Paul Walter Hauser is spectacular as Richard Jewell. Hauser should become a household name, after this unforgettable performance. The resemblance between Paul Walter Hauser & the real Richard Jewell, is uncanny. Sam Rockwell is outstanding as Watson Bryant. Hauser & Rockwell share effortless camaraderie throughout the film. Kathy Bates is fantastic as Bobi Jewell. Bates gives us another flawless performance, in her already legendary filmography. Jon Hamm is brilliant as Tom Shaw. Olivia Wilde is superb as Kathy Scruggs. The supporting cast is awesome. Richard Jewell is a must watch. It needs to get more attention at the Oscars, than it has so far during awards season. Go, watch it as soon as possible.",Richard Jewell

82,springfieldrental,The Media Doesn't Want You To See This,10,16 December 2019,"Today's media, with its harsh criticism of this film, has suppressed the opening weekend box office of this very fine movie. After watching Richard Jewell, I can see why the print and television outlets don't want this movie seen by too many viewers.It wasn't just the Atlanta-Journal Constitution, the paper the broke the story of the FBI's interest in Mr. Jewell, but CNN, NBC, the New York Times and a host of other news outlets were complicit in crucifying an innocent security guard who spotted the explosive backpack. Director Clint Eastwood meticulously goes through each step of how the FBI's rush to judgement and its supporting media cast ruined the reputation of the hero who saved hundreds of lives from a terrorist action and portrayed him as suspect number one.The film's impact is further magnified by the media's actions today. Members who write and spout unproven accusations, provided by gov't agencies, should have learned important lessons from the Atlanta Summer Olympics episode. But sadly, they hadn't, and will continue its barbaric habits. A must see movie!",Richard Jewell
83,kjproulx,A Powerful Story Worth Telling,9,7 January 2020,"Whether you're looking at films like Gran Torino or American Sniper, you can call Clint Eastwood masterful even to this day, but you also have to look at his recent works in either Hereafter or The 15:17 to Paris. Although he still has a knack for directing at nearly 90 years of age, he's sort of hit-or-miss over these last 10 years. Richard Jewell is his latest directorial effort behind the camera and not only is it one of his best films in years, but it's also one of the better true stories I've seen in a while. Here's why I believe this film deserves to be seen.During the 1996 Olympics, a bomb was planted in Centennial Park during a concert. Security guard Richard Jewell noticed it before it went off and ended up saving many lives. Due to coincidences in the story, Jewell was exploited as being the one who planted the bomb to make himself out as a hero. This film tells the truth about what went on and it's one of the more moving stories I've experienced this year. It's bad enough to be falsely accused of something you didn't do, but what this man had to endure was pure insanity.Performed by Paul Walter Hauser in the titular role, I never once believed I was watching an actor portraying someone else. His performance is so authentic that it brought me to tears on multiple occasions. He absolutely deserves to be spoken about as one of the finest performers of 2019. On top of his incredible performance (which I hope to see much more of in the future), Kathy Bates portrays Bobi Jewell, Richard's mother, and although her character is slightly one-note throughout the course of the film, she brings a needed level of emotion and makes much more of this character than what seems to have been scripted.Normally I don't praise a film for being slow in terms of pacing, but I believe the slow nature of this movie is actually what made me enjoy it more than I would have if it has been made in a more energetic way. The way Eastwood got calm performances out of the majority of this cast felt like a way of easing the audience into certain scenes. It doesn't hurt that performers like Jon Hamm and Sam Rockwell are in the supporting roles either. Richard Jewell is loaded with talent in front of and behind the camera, so it really shouldn't be a surprise that this story would work as well as it does.In the end, Richard Jewell is a real triumph in terms of exposing the truth and what this man had to go through. From the screenplay by Billy Ray keeping it honest, yet light-hearted at times, to composer Arturo Sandoval delivering some very subtle pieces to make you feel a certain way, to the editing by veteran Joel Cox, who has been by Eastwood's side for a long time, everything about this film was well-done. It's very straight-forward, but that was clearly the intention, so it's not exactly a negative. Richard Jewell is a great film and one of my favourites of 2019.",Richard Jewell

So glad this story is being told. It is one of the nearly endless number of times the media misreporting destroys someone's lives. The media is more weaponized than ever and is completely immune from any sort of consequences. i really like Eastwood's movies It felt like a movie from the 90's. I'm glad I watched it. Great movie!

85,tm-sheehan,Great Movie Storytelling with no gimmicks,9,14 February 2020,"My Review- Richard Jewell
My Rating - 9/10
Wow! What a great film no tricks , no gimmicks, just great direction , great storytelling and great acting.
Like Just Mercy Richard Jewell got passed over for Award Nominations this year at least Kathy Bates was nominated for Best Supporting Actress. What is it with Americans? don't they like their crazy justice system or media exploitation being exposed?
Clint Eastwood has done it again in directing this fine film without any gimmicks or surprises and bought to the screen a true story that needed to be told.
Unlike Spotlight (2015 ) and The Post (2017) which portrayed the media in a positive light exposing corruption and cover ups Richard Jewell shows the ugly underbelly of Trial by Media and the F.B.I incompetence and their quest to obtain a conviction at any cost .
These stories need to be exposed only today just before we saw Richard Jewell a family who had a school in our local area had serous child abuse charges dismissed after 2 years of accusation by media after no evidence was found and one of the children admitted lying.The performances in Richard Jewell are superb Paul Walter Hauser ( Remember him in I , Tonya and BlackKlansman) as Richard Jewell the Law and Order uniform obsessed victim who does more to help the FBI suspect him by opening his mouth becoming his own worst enemy is Oscar worthy in my view as is Sam Rockwell in another wonderful portrayal as Watson Bryant , Richard's attorney and friend who eventually gets his message through to Richard to shut the ""F"" pup.
Kathy Bates of course is superb as Bobi Jewell the mother shattered by her sons ordeal and fall from hero status to criminal monster.
Jon Hamm as the FBI agent Tom Shaw and Olivia Wilde as Kathy Scruggs the journalist who is responsible for the story after her seductive charms to get the name of the FBI suspect are both outstanding in very unsympathetic roles.
I don't tell the story in reviews or give Spoilers I think the trailer and most importantly the film should do that and Clint Eastwood's Richard Jewell certainly does tell a powerful story it makes you think next time you read or hear a sensational crime story or a suspect being interrogated it's only a story until the person of persons are found guilty and Trial by Media is no Fair Trial At All....",Richard Jewell

87,maccas-56367,Another brilliant film directed by Clint Eastwood,8,19 September 2020,"Sometimes actors and actress depict unpleasant characters so convincingly, that they ruin themselves to an audience as a person - this happened in Richard Jewell for me. Both Jon Hamm and Olivia Wilde irritated me to the extent I'll struggle watching them in anything else again.The pacing of Richard Jewell and the fact it was a true story, kept me engaged throughout. It never felt slow. The frustration and treatment of Richard almost became too much at times. Thank god for Sam Rockwell and his performance as Watson Bryant. Rockwell felt like he was often playing the character of ""us"", the audience. He also provided welcome comic relief, as well as being someone in Richard's corner.I'd never heard of Paul Walter Hauser before this. He hit it out of the ballpark with his portrayal of Richard Jewell. How did this man not scoop up a heap of awards? Have I missed something? He was fantastic. Kathy Bates also had her moments to shine as Richard's Mama. She seemed so suited to that role.Clint Eastwood has given us a powerful tribute here - doing the story (and the man) justice. Feels quite timely too, given current circumstances around the world. Recommend, though not a film I'll watch more than once.",Richard Jewell
88,joachimokeefe,"Lawyers good, journalists bad. Spot the hypocrite.",5,3 February 2020,"89-year-old Clint knows how direct a movie, for sure. This is the well-paced, well-acted, fact-based story of a somewhat immature man who endured an 88-day trial-by-media after his name as prime suspect in the Centennial Park bombing (being the security man who found the bomb before it detonated) was leaked by the FBI to the Atlanta press.In this, the writer Billy Ray ( and Eastwood, presumably) misses the whole point by a Georgia mile. The late Kathy Scruggs, the journalist who apparently got the name, is vilified by this film as badly as Jewell ever was. The story is of the injustice against Jewell being put right thanks to his own integrity and that of his attorney. It's depicted at the cost of Kathy Scruggs (as the sub-villain to Jon Hamm's stereotypical 'bad cop' FBI agent) without evidence, without corroboration and without a scrap of testimony, exactly as Jewell was hung out to dry by the media and FBI. Two wrongs don't make a right, unfortunately.The real drama is how the name was leaked to the press, not whether Jewell would be exonerated, as it's pretty obvious he will be from the start, and this is glibly depicted as a 'Jon Hamm doing Don Draper' scene.Some great performances, some great direction, but as ethically unsound as the FBI's investigation of Jewell himself.",Richard Jewell

90,Andres-Camara,"Emotional, as he knows how to do it",6,28 April 2020,"The pity is that it is not his best movie. He is a director who knows how to make movies, as he has shown many times, although this film did not go down in history. The most important thing in the film is to show how the state can be wrong, how individual freedom is important and how, as the protagonist himself says, if the person who finds a bomb makes life impossible, who from now on will say something when you see something suspicious.The actors are great. From the protagonist, like all the police passing through Katy.Lighting is no wonder. It is not the lighting of an American blockbuster. I imagine Eastwood is already more than other things that has made everything great. As he himself said in an interview, he did not like shooting many takes, because it made people waste time, if it went right the first time so why continue.Eastwood has shot better movies. I've seen his movies where all the departments are great. I have seen him position and move the camera with wonderful precision. In this case, it is enough for the camera to play an observer role, it does not use it to tell the story. The rhythm is very good. It lasts more than two hours and does not last long. There is someone who knows a lot about cinema in command.It will not be for posterity, and it is not his best film, but it is worth seeing.",Richard Jewell
91,MrDHWong,"A simple, relatively straightforward story of one man's struggle to restore his reputation",8,20 February 2020,"Richard Jewell is a biographical drama film produced and directed by Clint Eastwood, based on the article ""American Nightmare: The Ballad of Richard Jewell"" by Marie Brenner. Starring Paul Walter Hauser, Sam Rockwell, and Kathy Bates, it is a simple, relatively straightforward story of one man's struggle to restore his reputation.In 1996, the city of Atlanta is hosting the Olympic Games and security guard Richard Jewell (Paul Walter Hauser) keeps watch over a concert at the nearby Centennial Park. After dealing with some rowdy youths, Richard discovers a suspicious backpack placed underneath a bench which he later finds out contains a large pipe bomb and so orders the rest of his security team to move the concert goers as far away as possible. When the bomb eventually detonates, there are considerably less victims and damage due to Richard's quick thinking and he is hailed as a hero by the local press. A short time later, Richard is accused by the FBI of plotting the very attack he helped to stop as he apparently fits their description of a typical perpetrator, and this leads to him fighting a lengthy series of battles to clear his name.Both well-told and well-acted, Richard Jewell sheds light on America's flawed justice system and the media's obsession with sensationalistic journalism. Right from the beginning, Richard is depicted as a down-to-earth, relatable everyman who believes he is only doing his job in protecting people from danger, constantly rejecting the notion of being regarded as a public figure. To see how he goes from being viewed as a hero to a villain in the blink of an eye is a frightening thought, especially when there is no hard evidence against him. The way in which the media often refuses to distinguish between an allegation and a confirmation is still a prevalent problem today and this film showcases such an issue to the audience in an easily understood manner, in that something like this could happen to anyone at any time.Director Clint Eastwood clearly has a penchant for everyday American men being hailed as heroes, as he covered similar ground in his films ""Sully"" and ""The 15:17 to Paris"". In addition to this, he also seems to enjoy showing how the media doesn't always have all of the facts when running a story on said heroes and that some of it could very well end up being ""fake news"". I'm not sure if this is meant to reflect Eastwood's political leanings or if he genuinely hates media manipulation as a whole but it seems to be an ongoing theme in some of his recent films. With that said, there also appears to be jabs taken at the FBI itself, in that they are moments which show Richard's house being bugged and wires being planted on any acquaintances he interacts with. This did lead to certain scenes dragging on longer than they should have as I felt that the privacy concerns regarding the FBI had been established several times throughout the film and some parts seemed as though they were there simply to pad out the run time.Relative newcomer Paul Walter Hauser, who rose to prominence thanks to some memorable supporting roles in ""I, Tonya"" and ""BlacKkKlansman"", does a superb job in the title role, bringing a stern yet likeable vibe to his performance that makes his plight all the more interesting to watch. For his first leading role, Hauser has definitely proven he can hold his own alongside the rest of a cast of more well-known actors. Sam Rockwell also shines as lawyer Watson Bryant, who fights for Richard's exoneration in the face of public scrutiny. However, Kathy Bates is certainly worth mentioning as well, playing Richard's loving mother Bobi. Seeing her stressful breakdowns as she watches her son's reputation dragged through the mud is quite heart-wrenching.Overall, even though this subject basis has already been covered, Eastwood still manages to provide an entertaining film thanks mainly due to the excellent performances of its actors. As previously stated, the idea of someone just doing their job being inadvertently thrusted into the spotlight could happen to anyone and we are often unprepared to face the consequences by ourselves. It certainly doesn't hurt to have films like this to remind us of how we need to be alert of everything happening around us.I rate it 7.5/10",Richard Jewell
92,Alexander_Blanchett,Most underrated film of 2019,9,23 January 2020,"Very underrated. It is Clint Eastwood's best film since ""Million Dollar Baby"" and a masterclass of old fashioned Cinema in a way. An extremely well drafted Story About a fallen hero. One of Eastwood's arch Topics.
The film convinces through its fantastically built leading characters and tense Story. While it is a true Story and the Outcome more or less familiar, it is still exciting. You easily get connected to the lead Protagonist Richard Jewell, perfectly portrayed by Paul Walter Hauser, who easily gives one of the Top 10 Performances and is one of the most exciting ""Newcomers"" of 2019 (not really a Newcomer but this is definitely his breakout role). Hauser really understands how to portray the sensitive side of his character but doesnt hide to Show his flaws either. A great Performance. Sam Rockwell is also perfectly cast as his lawyer and giving us other great Rockwell Moments here. Kathy Bates is absolutely fantastic and finally gets an Environment to Shine again. She totally deserves her Oscar Nomination and I actually think she is the best of her bunch. Such an emotional tragic Performance of a loving mother that is worried About her sons fate. There are especially two extremely emotional Moments of the film that lets Bates totally own it. Fantatic.

96,phenomynouss,plain and boring and unserious,5,26 September 2020,"I just saw this today, and am well aware of the controversy that arose from the movie as a result of the depiction of Kathy Scruggs in particular, so I took Olivia Wilde's scenes with a very heavy dose of skepticism, but at the end of the movie, it feels almost pointless. Her character could've practically been removed entirely with absolutely no change to the overall story. Her inclusion and portrayal feels less like a crucial story aspect and more like a personal vendetta by the writer and/or director to smear someone's character long after their death.
As for the film itself, it was fairly simply, plain, and straightforward, to the point of being boring. Paul Walter Hauser and Sam Rockwell keep up a great chemistry and rapport all throughout which does a lot to make most of the film watchable, but it all comes across as so low-key for what should have been a serious national incident.
The entire tone and pacing of the film feels like it's about a man wrongfully accused of a small town car theft. The stakes are almost nonexistent and a whole lot of the conflict feels almost patently manufactured. Whether or not this is how the actual FBI investigation against Jewell went, I don't know, but since the movie only really shows us things from Jewell's perspective, it becomes maddening.
Jewell himself becomes mad, flustered at being the target of an investigation. We, the audience, become mad, because we know he's innocent--- we see the events leading up to the bomb and we've seen Richard Jewell's character going back to a 1986 prologue where he first meets Sam Rockwell's character. He's a pushover, he's a teddy bear, he's not a white supremacist anti-government terrorist.
But the FBI in this film, concentrated with an unwarranted vehemence in the character played by Jon Hamm, is so fixated on Richard Jewell that it becomes incoherent and nonsensical. Again, as I do not know how the actual investigation went, I cannot judge if this is how it was actually depicted.
The problem is that the film does not bother to show much of any of the FBI's side of the investigation. We never get to see or hear any real evidence or reasoning for the heavy suspicion on Jewell beyond a single, superficial behavioral profile made of Jewell --- that he intentionally set up the bomb so as to pretend to discover it and make himself the hero --- that seems to be forgotten every so often as they start toying with their completely contradictory motive of Jewell being an anti-government militia terrorist.
There's almost no investigating done by literally either side. The FBI takes some stuff from his home and we don't see what is done with most of it, if anything. Jewell's lawyer times a walk from Centennial Park to the payphone where the bomb threat was called and determines Jewell was too fat to make it in time. That's the entirety of the investigating, either for or against Jewell.
Olivia Wilde's character's role is essentially just to be the concentrated form of ""da newz"" that is supposedly ruining Jewell's life and slandering him and making him public enemy number one...Except we literally do not see any of this. Jewell gets followed around by media cameras and reporters occasionally, but otherwise nothing. Even as a thin, flimsy allegory of supposed ""cancel culture"", this doesn't work because ""Da Media"" is barely a factor in his life or in his quest to clear his name.
We never see him getting harassed on the street by random people who read about him in the newspapers and think he's a terrorist. We never see him getting kicked out of places or his house vandalized or absolutely anything to suggest he is being unduly ""cancelled"" or condemned by the media.
All of these aspects which were apparently supposed to generate some buzz and a bit of controversy are complete red herrings. Virtually the entire second half of the film is just regurgitating the exact same message of Paul Hauser's ""I'm so innocent I'm cooperating with the FBI!"" versus Jon Hamm's ""God I hate that fat guy! We need to get his ass""
As well, either due to the tone of the film, or the lack of any real media attention beyond the cliché ""media rushes someone as they walk to their car asking tons of questions"", or the lack of literally ANY police investigation on the part of the FBI, the entire film feels like there are little or no stakes at play.
People actually died when the bomb went off, and Richard Jewell actually suspected it was a bomb and alerted the police who brought a bomb squad guy in and found out it was a bomb and they moved people away before it suddenly exploded.
Absolutely nothing past that moment in the film feels like it's in the same film as a terrorist bombing. This feels like almost like a goofy comedy-drama of a big momma's boy accused of being a Chinese spy .",Richard Jewell
97,Azanspy,A hurting 'humane' story.,8,19 March 2020,"Richard Jewell is a well made biography of the hero who wrongly turned into villain. I like these old school Hollywood movies and I enjoy it while I get these films as people don't go see these movies in theatres. This movie was one of the many old school movies that bombed last year and I don't think the studios will continue to make movies like this and it's sad and bad for Hollywood. Richard Jewell had very good performances from Paul Walter, Sam Rockwell, Olivia Wilde, Jon Hamm and an excellent Kathy Bates who deserved that Oscar nod. Clint Eastwood is still doing great at his age and I hope continue to make good movies if he can.

98,statuskuo,Media Is The Real Criminal Here,9,24 December 2019,"Surprisingly funny and poignant on how a simple sensational headline ruined a man's life...made worse that he was actually a hero. Paul Walter Hauser plays the titular character with the southern lax that is incredible. Academy take notice...this man embodied the silently suffering misguided (sometimes naive) oddball that would fit any office radar for the possibility of any crime. As the story unfolds, you realize how anyone given any time with the simple Forrest Gump type would even consider the attempt. Most of those domestic terrorist were highly intelligent misanthropes. Jewel, at best, was a do-gooder whose polite often grating by the books samaritan is a natural suspect for a seasoned fed played by Jon Hamm. A brilliant dissection that was never boring and very aggravating in its comedy of errors. That said, Olivia Wilde's brash portrayal of Atlanta journalist Kathy Scruggs is truly a villain whose sole purpose was to get the story right before getting facts. Her comeuppance isn't fully realized in this film but most definitely corrects itself in real life. Brillian lt direction by Mr. Eastwood as always",Richard Jewell
99,andrewroy-04316,"Another in a wave of dramatized retellings of major past events that have come out in the last few years, and Eastwood knows how to tell this story",8,3 February 2020,"Reminiscent in tone to the only other big role Paul Walter Hauser has had, in I, Tonya, and in the upsetting legal scenes adding shades of the miniseries When They See Us, Richard Jewell is a poignant and well told story. The basic events of how the bombing happened and the media firestorm around Jewell are all true, even if some liberties are taken with some side characters. It's an infuriating story about how people with legal power (in this case the FBI) are often incentivized to make some angle seem real, rather than finding the real truth. It's always infuriating, and this has been tackled plenty of times in recent media, but usually it's about the lawyers in a courtroom searching for an angle rather than truth; here, it's the FBI trying to make a convenient angle stick. Jewell was a plainly good character who had the utmost respect for the law and police, which is why the dishonesty and smear on him is so upsetting, in a related but distinct way from When They See Us. There, it was because they were kids and being coerced through being told they could leave if they lie, and here it's because he has such faith that they wouldn't mislead him when that is all they do. More broadly, it's a story of how incentivized people are to pursue a story that will benefit them by attacking someone else. We see the media and FBI as the two main actors in that vein, as each doesn't have the time to properly vet the claim, instead just getting a convincing story out to the public. Hauser, Rockwell, and Bates are all great, and honestly while Bates is the movie's only nomination, I would've nominated both actors over her, as they were both great. I think Rockwell is more deserving of a supporting actor nomination for this than Vice last year. It's a tight script, punctuated by Jewell's powerful speech in the FBI office at the end explaining how this is bad law enforcement, how his faith in them is shaken, and how they're spending resources on him when there's a real bomber out there. Really strong film with a good telling of a fascinating if infuriating story, and the performances take it home.",Richard Jewell

Certainly one has to start with the media. But the next entity that needs to be examined are the feds. Is there a Nanogram of earnestness in the entire federal system? I think not. Is there a single agency that works for the common good? This story exposes the FBI as being an inept, incompetent, inane and incapable organization that more times than not gets it wrong. And destroys lives in the process.Then there is the media. What can one say? Always jumping to conclusions. Little fact to back up the stories. And who pays the price? Eastwood did a great job with this film as usual. He is a master filmmaker and this is a great story. Certainly a story about the decay and the decline and the morally bankrupt level of American Society as it exists today. It is truly a nation in decline.

Thank god Sam Rockwell was in this. He definitely brought some life to the film. I don't see why Kathy Bates gets an Oscar nomination for her performance.

103,sweidman-28016,Great Performances and Good Story,7,23 December 2019,"Richard Jewell Review:Directed by Clint Eastwood, Richard Jewell follows an American security guard, Richard Jewell (Paul Walter Hauser), as he saves thousands of lives from an exploding bomb at the 1996 Olympics, but is vilified by journalists and the press who falsely reported that he was a terrorist. To be honest I wasn't even going to write a review in this. It's been well over a week and I've been so busy with everything that I had no time. I skipped writing a a review for the miniseries Mrs. Fletcher (which is good; B+) and just writing shorter reviews lately. This one will be short again since I don't remember everything super clear. It's not that I didn't like this, but I just haven't had the time. I actually found myself liking this movie a little more than I expected. Watching the trailer I had hardly any interest in seeing this to be honest. Clint Eastwood starred and directed The Mule last year and I think he's a good director and actor. Everyone freaked out when he said he was done acting and basically everyone saw The Mule, at least in my town. I liked it when I saw it but I've grown to have less of an interest in it as time went by. That's what I thought Richard Jewell would be like. Sure, there's the chance that I won't want to rewatch it as much as I visit movies again as frequent as I do, but I liked it more than The Mule. The direction was all there and good from Eastwood. I wouldn't say he did anything spectacular with directing but he never seems to make a bad movie. Where Richard Jewell shines is with Paul Walter Hauser as Richard Jewell. I'm just always surprised with his work. He was in I, Tonya and I loved him, then BlacKkKlansman, followed by the under appreciated movie Late Night, and now this. Hauser has become one of the best actors right now it seems, yet no one really knows about him. This is his best performance and I'd love to see him in more leading roles. The other performance I really liked was Sam Rockwell. He's another actor that's just great with every role he's given. Playing Watson Bryant won't be a role he'll be well known for in the future but I thought he did such a fine job. Kathy Bates just recently got the Golden Globe nomination for best supporting actress for this movie and I love her work. I'm just very surprised she received a nomination. She did very well like always but there isn't a scene that sticks out from other supporting actress this year with great performances. Kathy isn't bad by all means, I just think maybe someone else could've gotten the nomination. Overall really nice acting. The movie follows the same sort of typical biopic hero setup as some others with the tones and conflicts lining up in certain spots. It's a good story. Only a few times did it actually drag just a little. It's over two hours and some of it could've been taken out. The very beginning felt a little awkward to me because it took place a few years before the main story just to show where he worked up from. Maybe they could've taken that bit out and just talked about it in another spot. Those were my only main issues with this movie. I'm very surprised at how much it under performed at the box office, especially for a Clint Eastwood movie. I'd suggest seeing Richard Jewell. It's a good movie with great performances.My Grade: B+",Richard Jewell

106,akcenat,Tale of redemption and how the court of public opinion can be wrong,7,8 April 2020,"""Richard Jewell"" is a solid effort by Eastwood (89) to succeed in soliciting empathy for the innocent security guard who reported finding the explosive device at the 1996 Atlanta Summer Olympics bombing, but at the expense of demeaning others involved. The result is an anti-media, anti-FBI diatribe that shows the biases of the director. The slim characterizations of his pursuers does leave Richard Jewell feeling rather one-note, but it is bolstered by the whole cast. Ultimately, this is a good (and too long) melodrama with great performances, but somewhat lacking in energy, while movie plays a little too much like a TV film but is typically accessible, crowd pleasing and polished.Rating: 7+/8-",Richard Jewell

110,Mike_Devine,Another Eastwood film that deserved more,8,8 September 2020,"Even as Clint Eastwood reaches the twilight years of his career, he finds a way to churn out impactful, memorable stories. In 2019's 'Richard Jewell,' we become acquainted with a seemingly familiar story that is very much unfamiliar to the masses.Paul Walter Hauser stands in as the hero-turned-suspect-turned-hero again who saved the lives of many would-be victims of the 1996 Atlanta Summer Olympics bombing. In 'Jewell,' we get to see the behind the scenes events that unfolded out of the public's eye - away from the Katie Courics and the Tom Brokaws of the world. Hauser's acting should have been recognized for what it was, as well as strong performances from Kathy Bates and Sam Rockwell (on the other hand, Olivia Wilde and John Hamm were surprisingly weak).Eastwood takes care to paint very detailed pictures without making the audience feel like dunces. There's also enough wit and cleverity written in the dialogue, especially between Rockwell's lawyerly shorts-wearing Watson Bryant and pretty much everyone who crosses his path. And even though the film is based on a true story, it's suspenseful enough that anyone can be entertained by it despite many knowing how it ends.It may not have received as much widespread acclamation as it deserved, but 'Richard Jewell' is an example of strong storytelling that is worthy of admiration.",Richard Jewell
111,SnobReviews,"""Richard Jewell"" is a terrific film.",8,27 December 2019,"""Richard Jewell"" proves that director Clint Eastwood is still in fighting form and at the top of his game. An intriguing and frustrating film that will burn in your memory.

In this drama based on a true story, security guard Richard Jewell is investigated as the bomber of the 1996 Atlanta Olympics.
.
Eastwood has put together a sensational all-star cast and has made one of his best films in many years. Paul Walter Hauser is fantastic as Jewell, and has a way of playing a certain type of character to a tee (see ""I, Tonya""). ""Richard Jewell"" is a frustrating story and you are pinned to the edge of your seat throughout. Eastwood creates this aura of tenseness that you will feel in the pit of your stomach. I really enjoyed this film.",Richard Jewell
112,eagandersongil,The competent biography,8,18 January 2020,"""Richard's case"" is a good and competent bibliography, following the line that Clint has been following in his films for some time, portraying small American heroes with assertiveness and good technical and artistic elements.The script tells the story of Richard, a security guard who aspires to be a policeman who finds a bomb during the 96 Olympics, even with the explosion, the security guard ends up saving many lives and then sees himself as the main suspect in its implementation, following a timeline and without opening spaces for interpretations or contemplations the script focuses on three nuclei that intertwine and talk to each other, two of these nuclei represent the government and the media, and the feature exposes the malice and malice of those who seek an agony to condemn together public opinion.Clint's direction interweaves some arcs and conducts the narrative in a precise way, without creating unnecessary scenes, its editing helps with a constant rhythm that makes the two-hour film seem to have had only one, despite a slightly cold direction. and not authorial, Clint is accurate in every scene, with simple cameras, clear photography and relying a lot on his actors.And speaking of his cast of actors we speak of yet another hit by Clint and his production, all the actors are great in their roles, but it is worth highlighting the choice of the protagonist, actor Paul Walter, who delivers an amazing performance and his mom, the already stamped Kathy Bates looks wonderful and lives up to her nomination, Sam Rockwell also delivers a great performance. 8/10",Richard Jewell
113,jamiedarlow-37510,'Richard.... I'm never giving you s*** about anything ever again.',10,28 February 2021,"Clint Eastwood's latest directorial work with a brilliant script by Billy Ray is a really beautifully performed masterpiece based on a fascinating true story. Richard Jewell (Paul Walter Hauser) is a paper man turned school guard turned security guard who has firm faith in law and order. On a security job at an outdoor concert in 1996, he discovers a bomb and saves multiple lives when it's discovered to be active. Praised by many as a hero but falsely claimed to be a suspect by the FBI and the media, he undergoes strenuous investigation which makes a huge impact on he and his mother's (Kathy Bates) lives. The performances are so important to the overwhelming impact of the already impressive story; Hauser is absolutely brilliant in the lead role and is one of the most sympathetic characters on the big screen in a long time. Bates is just beautiful as Bobi and this might've become my new favourite role of hers! Sam Rockwell has already been in Jojo Rabbit which is still my favourite film so far this year and he goes and provides another hugely memorable performance here as Richard's friend and lawyer Watson Bryant. What I loved is not just how technically well made the film is but how it's never afraid to spend time with its characters in the more intimate moments. For example, Watson's receptionist/girlfriend Nadya (played by Nina Arianda) has just as delightful playful scenes with Watson as Richard and his mother do. The more intense the story gets, the more infuriating it is to see the people we've grown warm to go through the wringer. Even better than suspected, this is a must see!",Richard Jewell
114,adrianovasconcelos,"Very good Eastwood, vintage Rockwell, Bates performances",7,3 January 2020,"I am a great admirer of Clint Eastwood, especially in the capacity of director. He has directed doubtless masterpieces like MYSTIC RIVER and MILLION DOLLAR BABY, with UNFORGIVEN and CHANGELING in close proximity.RICHARD JEWELL is on the same level as CHANGELING. It presents a real life incident and its implications, and it does so intelligently and by and large without taking sides.Strong dialogue, script and cinematography. Acting by Rockwell and Bates is top notch, with Wilde and Hamm also excellent in their comparatively small parts.Sadly, it is Paul Hauser's performance that I don't buy. He looks like Babe Ruth and his mannerisms, especially when he rolls his eyes for no apparent reason, began irritating me from mid-movie. That said, his relationship with his mother (played by Bates) is quite convincing, and that is a big plus.One other aspect that didn't go down well with me was the alleged affair between journalist Scruggs and FBI officer Tom Shaw. Perhaps it was meant to suggest collusion between FBI and media, but these people exist, have a reputation to preserve, and there is no evidence that they actually exchanged info in that manner.I was also not very impressed with Wilde crying at the end, as if suddenly she developed a conscience after consciously dropping Jewell's name in the mud.Once all is said and done, this is a good film and a massive boost for democracy, and I'm really happy that Eastwood, who turns 90 on 31 May 2020, is still able to produce films of this quality.",Richard Jewell

116,shanayneigh,Mediocre,3,14 March 2021,"This movie is an example of two wrongs don't make a right. Was it necessary to paint a picture of the female reporter (who is now dead and unable to defend herself) as basically an unscrupulous lady of the night?This movie also wants me to be angry with the way Jewell was treated, but I have to be honest, I don't feel it's the least bit strange why he was under investigation. Or perhaps the screenwriter and director simply didn't manage to tell that story well enough. Clint ""Empty Chair"" Eastwood's outrage probably has more to do with it being a white guy getting treated this way than principles.I honestly thought that guy playing the lead was an amateur actor due to his stilted performance, but apparently he's been in other movies.The explosion itself looks amateurish.",Richard Jewell
117,thebricks,Excellent portrayal of the sleaziness of law enforcement,10,18 December 2019,"I have experience dealing with the Feds and found this movie incredibly compelling. So much about this movie hit home for me. Just a few examples, when the Feds came to talk to Jewell and tried to make him sign shady documents, bugging his home, the slick self-righteous agent who thinks he decides who is right and wrong, cleaning out his home supposedly looking for evidence, wasting time on easy, harmless suspects instead of finding the real criminals to boost their career. It's sad. All that time spent looking at Richard Jewell as a suspect while the real terrorist got away. They knew he was innocent, all they had to do was actually do some actual investigative, science-based investigative work instead of using confirmation bias.Can you imagine what would have happened if Jewell didn't have access to a great lawyer or had the law enforcement background to spot the tricks the Feds were using? He would probably have been in prison until his death, which is nuts. At no point did anyone use common sense and point out that there was absolutely no evidence this guy was involved. They were looking for an easy mark.It just shows that reform is needed drastically. I've always thought that many in American law enforcement are not educated, which leads to this sort of thing happening too often. Then you have the for-profit prison system which encourages all the corruption in the justice system to begin with.If I had kids, I'd definitely show them this movie and point out all the things Jewell did wrong and what to do in a situation like this. It should be mandatory to show in Civics classes, TBH.",Richard Jewell

I did not rate Eastwood's Sully which was the previous film of his I saw but the story of this interested me.
This is well acted and well plotted and quite moving.
Jewell was a bit of a geek so he fitted the prejudice of the investigators.

121,flicklover,Thank you Clint Eastwood!,10,11 December 2019,"I just came back from a prescreening of this film and just had to comment. It is a very timely and comes in a time in our country where the media picks who they want to deify and who they want to destroy without caring about who they hurt. Clint Eastwood has created an eloquent, but searing critique on our media dominated society. He isn't Oliver Stone that comes with outrageous conspiracies and makes everyone a villain. The film says that we are forgetting that in this country your are innocent until PROVEN guilty not the other way around.The film is about Richard Jewell, the security guard that at first was hailed as a hero for finding the bomb and prevented a worse tragedy in 1996 at the Atlanta Olympics. The film focuses on the events after the bombing. Richard Jewell is presented as a humble but rather over zealous security guard that considered himself a law enforcement officer. Richard Jewell is played by Paul Walter Hauser in an oscar worthy performance. He plays Jewell with a wide eyed boy scout devotion to law enforcement but with a quiet dignity. Sam Rockwelk plays Watson, his friend and lawyer who helps him in the media a FBI onslaught that wanted to portray him as a lone bomber. His mother is played beautifully by Kathy Bates. The film focuses on the media and it's disregard to really investigate things instead of rushing to judgement because they liked the narrative. Sound familiar? Eastwood indicts them as rushing to judgement. The FBI agents are presented as doing there job but under pressure to find someone to blame for the bombing. It is all done in a great and heartfelt style which is typical.for Clint Eastwood. This man was innocent, but because he met a certain profile they went after him. The funny thing is that Jewell himself understands why they would be questioning him. But they had no hard evidence and the timeline of the bombing exonerated Jewell and the FBI ultimately declared him not a suspect. But for months they made Richard Jewell's life a living hell. The FBI was doing their job. The media rushed to judgement. This film comes out at a time where this happens regularly. It is as timely as ever.",Richard Jewell
122,mgd_m,Good drama,7,19 January 2020,"Human, and moving. Great acting. The best movie from Eastwood so far, in my opinion.

123,movieman6-413-929510,Richard Jewell shows well how the police and the news can sometimes wrongly accuse people.,7,8 March 2020,"Richard Jewell is a new biographical drama directed by Clint Eastwood, the director of Unforgiven and Million Dollar Baby.The film is about the American security guard Richard Jewell (Paul Walter Hauser). The 1996 Olympic Games are being held in America. Richard gets work in security here. During a corresponding concert Richard discovers that there is a bomb around the concert. Richard manages to ensure that there is no great chaos and so he manages to save countless lives. Richard is seen as a hero. Despite his heroic actions, Richard is seen by the FBI and later also by journalists as the prime suspect who has placed the bomb himself. Because of this bad publicity, Richard is suddenly seen as a terrorist instead of a hero. To prove his innocence, Richard enlists the help of the independent anti-establishment lawyer Watson Bryant (Sam Rockwell). Together, the two engage in a tough battle in court against the FBI, who is trying to get Richard into prison with many journalistic evidence.This film shows how something like false information can quickly turn a hero into a villain. This shows how the news can influence things like a lawsuit even if they are sometimes wrong. Journalists often do this to inform the people, but also to benefit from it themselves. Because of this their ego can sometimes become a bit too big, so they don't always check the facts as well and thus share wrong information with a population or the whole world. This film also shows how an organization such as the FBI works to get a suspect to confess, even if they don't have enough evidence. In this way, they try to teach you as a viewer that you should not believe everything the justice or news tells you without having to do some research yourself.The acting is also done well in the film. Other actors such as Leonardo DiCaprio and Jonah Hill were also interested in playing the Richard Jewell role. Because of their busy schedules, they have not been able to play the role, but both actors have remained with the film as producers. In the end, the role went to Paul Walter Hauser, who set it up in a good and appropriate way. He looks good as a nice man who tries to help everyone without wanting anything in return. It can be sad to see such a good person go down due to the police and the news. Sam Rockwell is also doing well as Richard Jewell his lawyer trying to clear his name. For this he must even force Richard to be less nice or helpful towards others such as police.",Richard Jewell

132,frank4122,Best Movie In A Generation,10,15 December 2019,"I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS MOVIE! We are all Richard Jewell. When a once storied agency can abuse it's power and take away all due process rights afforded in the Constitution, we all in grave danger. I once thought that the corruption in the FBI was limited to a few corrupt execs at the top, Jewell proves that is not the case. The program I work in is being scrapped and rebuilt as it is not very efficient. The FBI is not only totally inefficient, they are actively working to frame the innocent and destroy people's lives. FBI has lost all credibility. They knew that the entrapment they set up against an uncouth Jewell would make him a perfect patsy. The FBI had no concern of finding the actual bomb maker, they put all their energy to violating due process rights, and continued to harass a hero when they knew they he was innocent. The FBI needs to be scraped and rebuilt as an investigative agency that protects, serves and follows the Constitution.The media also needs to be held accountable for destroying the lives of innocent people. Jewell settled out of court with Tom Brokaw and NBC. Brokaw shamelessly said this, ""They probably have enough to arrest him right now, probably enough to prosecute him, but you always want to have enough to convict him as well."" Having read 'Unfreedom OF The Press' by Mark Levin, this movie substantiates everything in that book.All the actors gave passionate career performances beyond my wildest expectations. Given that, Paul Walter Hauser as Richard Jewell gave one of the best performances I have ever seen. I was totally immersed in his role. He was me, my neighbor, the security guard at my job who works tirelessly to keep me and my colleagues safe. Thank you everyone involved in this wonderful masterpiece.",Richard Jewell
133,PetarNeo,Paul Walter Hauser and Sam Rockwell are brilliant,10,30 January 2020,"Combine powerful story, Clint Eastwood as director and our leads (Paul Walter Hauser, Sam Rockwell and Kathy Bates), you find yourself on powerful drama that depicts all emotions that people might have felt when it all was happening.Clint Eastwood seems like he is just looking for stories that might have been forgotten or haven't been heard enough or may have been dropped under the radar and puts them in your face to relive and re-watch it on big screens and boy did he do it with this one.Following a wrongfully accused Richard Jewell as he and his mother are going through scrutiny and pain that it causes to the hero that saved dozens and dozens of lives by being himself. While watching there is a kind of unusual feeling of how imagining of Richard and his behaviour is, but his soul was so clean that you just can't past it and not feel for him. Pushing your benefits without realising how it may affect others and purely for your ego is also pretty good shown. Media is today's most powerful source of information and if being controlled or misleading it causes a real damage to people which can magnify already great suffering to magnitudes that no can imagine unless they feel it and we are there to witness it from second hand because of performances that seem like they have been thrown aside.Performances in this movie are profound and it looks like there is not enough attention being focused toward it and that might be because of media that is trying to defend themselves of being good when they are not.
Kathy Bates plays mother of Richard and is absolutely great on screen. You get the feeling of your mother being proud or sad or angry or devastated with her brilliant show in there. Sam Rockwell plays attorney that defended Richard and believed in him. There is no doubt that Sam is one of the best actors right now, as he moves, acts in a way that you can't resist his charm and dedication. Finally, the star, Paul Walter Hauser that is Richard Jewell and boy is he good. This is a great performance by him and his talent is finally coming to light with teeth-gritting, nail-bitting, at moments boyish innocent charm. There is nothing to not like about him, you can just sit, relax and enjoy.Brilliant, emotional, profound. 4/4",Richard Jewell
134,Lewis_Heather787,Meh ? It was ok................It should have been better !,6,28 December 2019,"Now when you have talent such as Sam Rockwell , Olivia Wilde , Jon Hamm and Katy Bates cast in a film depicting the 1996 Atlanta Olympic bombing...........directed by none other than Clint Eastwood himself................this should be a home run for sure.............right?? Sadly, with all the immense talent behind and in front of the camera, this film is know where near as good as it should have been!! Maybe I expected too much from Eastwood but this film, in a nut shell, is just ok...........there is nothing terrible about it but there is nothing great about it either.Don't get wrong Paul Walter Hauser is brilliant as Richard Jewell and so is the rest of the cast in their respective roles..............but there is just nothing there that is........WOW......you know?? There all good don't get me wrong, I feel the film desperately needed one of them to be outstanding to lift the film. To give it that extra piece that I felt it was missing..............to make me care me, to be more engaged and overall enjoy the experience of watching the film more.I think the main reason for me why the film is just ok is because of the script and the pacing are holding it back. The film is a little all over the place until the bombing actually happens then it starts to get a little more focused.........but even then it is very uneven. Also some of the dialogue is quite clunky to say the least......its just not that interesting to watch if I'm being honest. Especially when there are scenes with people just sitting down talking a lot.........its not very riveting. Its not helped by the pacing of the film................its just over 2 hours this film but my god does it feel over 3 hours. I have no idea why but it just felt so slow to move from one story event to the next.............or one scene to another.The last thing I'll say is..............what I got from the film was the fact that it depicts Richard Jewell as a good guy at heart, trying to do the right thing........however he is also an idiot. The film depicts film to be so stupid I almost don't believe it, there are some scenes where he just does or says the wrong thing over and over again..........is this realistic or true about the real man..........who knows. It just didn't sit well with me.Overall though this film is ok but its definitely disappointing considering the talent and potential this film has in its hands to be something truly special. This is happening with Eastwood at lot recently he has one good film followed by a not so good one. Anyway its 65% out of 100...................its ok, check it out if you like true story sort of stuff if not, I wouldn't bother your not missing out on anything amazing.............solid but not mind blowing in any way.",Richard Jewell

136,Avwillfan89,Would have been the perfect film about media misinformation...,7,9 November 2020,"If it wasn't for the portrayal of Kathy Scruggs.Richard Jewell is about about a wannabe law enforcement guy who's overzealousness works for and against him. He is fired from a job at a security guard at a college and then assigned again at the 1996 Olympics, where he first alerts authorities about a bomb threat. The bomb explodes and he is a national hero, only to be turned into the bad guy after the FBI investigates him as a suspect.The film is incredibly nuanced and sympathetic towards Richard Jewell and his mother, and I truly felt for them both. Kathy Bates is exceptionally brilliant as Bobi Jewell, the mother. But then again, she's always brilliant.Now I have to talk about Olivia Wilde's portrayal of Kathy Scruggs.Not only is her character a cackling, over the top badly written cartoon-like villain, the film wrongly alleges that she traded sex for FBI tips.This is not just a poor choice of writing (her being wild and OTT while the rest of the film is balanced and serious) but it also demonises and misrepresents a real life woman who is no longer alive to defend herself.So you have a film which correctly portrays the despicable treatment imposed on the Jewell family by the media and the FBI - accusing him of things he didn't do and portraying him in the worst fashion possible - and in the very same film wickedly slanders a dead woman with no real evidence.The real Scruggs was indeed ballsy and determined, but she was very good at her job, was kind, caring and well liked by everyone who knew her. And she certainly did not break conduct in the way she did in the movie.The screenplay was based on a book called ""The Suspect: An Olympic Bombing, the FBI, the Media, and Richard Jewell, the Man Caught in the Middle"" by Kent Alexander and Kevin Salwen. Even there, their reporting of Scruggs was both vague and dismissive, and the screenplay upped it up to 11 in their portrayal of her. Basically this is a classic case of men not knowing how female sexuality works, or even caring to know.It's a massive shame that such a brilliant film about fake news and character assassination ends up doing the very thing to a real life woman, who became depressed and overdosed later in life. If not for that, it would have been near perfect.",Richard Jewell

139,RhapsodyReviews,Amazing Film.,9,11 January 2020,"Review:
'Richard Jewell' is a biographical-drama film directed by Clint Eastwood. It is based on the 1997 Vanity Fair article 'American Nightmare: The Ballad of Richard Jewell' by Marie Brenner, and the 2019 book 'The Suspect: An Olympic Bombing, the FBI, the Media, and Richard Jewell, the Man Caught in the Middle' by Kent Alexander and Kevin Salwen.
I can't believe this movie is based on a true story. I really enjoyed this movie, and am now hoping for a possible Oscar nomination, at least for Best Director.
The film depicts the July 27 Centennial Olympic Park bombing and its aftermath, as security guard Richard Jewell (Paul Walter Hauser) finds a bomb during the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, Georgia, and alerts authorities to evacuate, only to later be wrongly accused of having placed the device himself.
The casting in this movie was top notch. Paul Walter Hauser was amazing as the title character playing him perfectly from the way he walks to the way he talks. Olivia Wilde plays a parasite of a reporter who was just looking for her next story, and not caring what happens this this man's life. Aside from the lead himself my two favorite characters were played by Kathy Bates and Sam Rockwell. They characters were nothing but likable and you want them on screen all the time.
Clint Eastwood has one of the greatest portfolios of smart, intelligent, interesting and well acted films. Sure, there are bigger known directors who make more exciting films, but Eastwood makes great dramas. The fact that this is a true story is crazy, sad and very anger inducing. It's great.
Overall, I think this is a movie everybody should watch at least once in their life. It will give you a new view on right and wrong as well as make you confused on how some people can be so good or bad.

149,Sasha_Lauren,"Powerful, important, excellent film",9,18 October 2020,"Seasoned, sometimes breathtaking, director Clint Eastwood orchestrates an impressive effort to tackle the true tale of hero-falsely-turned-prime suspect Richard Jewel, the security guard at the 1996 summer Olympics in Atlanta who discovered a suspicious backpack with three pipe bombs under a bench in Centennial Square during the crowded festivities. By alerting police in a timely manner and expediently helping evacuate the area, Jewel saved many people from death and injury. His reward was to be eventually eviscerated by a sloppy, corrupt media personified in bit of a cartoonish storyline by Olivia Wilde. Wilde's character interesects with Jon Hamm who personifies a bumbling, unsavory, deceitful FBI agent.Some of the crucial current - and long-term ongoing topics - in the film are: the snap judgement profiling of people leading to bogus convictions, which is tied in with cruel slander of innocent persons in the media; corruption and inept conduct by government institutons - in this case the FBI and local police - that destroy one's life and well being.This film, though not perfect, largely delivered for me on the basis of the performances of Sam Rockwell as Jewel's quirky, ernest lawyer, and Paul Walter Hauser in a compelling and stirring rendition as Richard Jewel. The chemistry bewteen these two adept actors crackled. A speech delivered by Hauser as Jewel during the asinine FBI depositions of him particularly moved me. I'd watch almost any film with Rockwell in it, and he did not disappoint here. I'm now a fan of Paul Walter Hauser. I am thoroughly disgusted with our so called justice system and the media.I recommend this film.",Richard Jewell

151,theredsky,Richard Jewell Review,7,24 December 2019,"I haven't seen a lot of Clint Eastwood films but I would say this is probably his best film. What really holds this film up from being mostly mediocre is the performances. A majority of the actors do a pretty great job with Sam Rockwell and Kathy Bates stealing the show. Rockwell brings this attorney with a temper and emotion for his old friend to life while Kathy Bates brings a loving mother figure for Richard with probably the most powerful scene and performance in the entire film. This is Paul Walter Hauser's first major leading role in a film and I felt he did a pretty great job. He was able to show a lot of emotion with just his body movements. Olivia Wilde and Jon Hamm did a good job but just weren't as good as the rest of the cast. The film's message is very poignant in our culture today. The film's central message is that we need to take news from ANY source with a grain of salt because they could be totally inaccurate or blown out of proportion to make someone look like a monster. While portions of the film were generally uninteresting, there were a couple of scenes I thought were really well put together and executed. One such scene would be the actual bombing scene in the beginning of the film. The sequence was incredibly tense because you know the bomb is about to go off but you don't know when. There is an interview sequence with Richard Jewell's mother and it was my favorite scene in the film. Kathy Bates breaking down with everyone around her starting to realize that Jewell may be innocent was pretty powerful. The final scene I really liked was a sequence close to the end of the film where Richard Jewell finally confronts the FBI. The way Richard Jewell confronts the FBI and talks to them about why he is being investigated and when they don't respond is pretty powerful but not the most powerful scene. The thing that keeps this film from being higher than a 7 is that the technical aspects are just okay. The cinematography is serviceable and the script is fine. The film says what it needs to say and then ends. It's plain and simple. Overall, Richard Jewell provides an insightful message on our culture today about the media with powerful performances to back it up.",Richard Jewell

Brilliant in the narration too where for all the duration of the film there is the benefit of the doubt, the suspance and the curiosity, everything driven by a beating rhythm, albeit keeping on neutral tones, so not making some tones overshadow others.

160,Dr_Mark_ODoherty,Great story of a hero who saved many people with his courage and diligence,10,19 October 2020,"Based on the true story of Richard Jewell, a security guard who discovered a bomb and saved many lives at a concert at Centennial Olympic Park during the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, Georgia. Initially hailed by the media as a hero, Jewell was soon considered a suspect by the FBI and local law enforcement. Though never charged, he underwent a ""trial by media"", before his name was finally cleared. Interesting to note, that also an official Justice Department investigation in 1997 of the FBI's conduct found the FBI had tried to manipulate Jewell into waiving his constitutional rights by telling him he was taking part in a training film about bomb detection; so in my opinion it certainly seems that the FBI in this particular case of Richard Jewell was responsible of unethical behaviour. So hopefully the FBI apparatus has also learned a lesson by this, of not pointing fingers at people too quickly, by conducting thorough and ethical investigations to avoid slandering a person's name. Perhaps the reporter, Kathy Scruggs, got a bit the short end of the stick in this film; who broke the story that security guard Richard Jewell was the focus of the federal investigation into the bomb that killed one person and injured 100 at Centennial Olympic Park. Apparently the stress that plagued her in the aftermath of the story contributed to the health problems that lead to her unspeakably sad death. In a way, Scruggs was perhaps also a scapegoat for errors of fact and judgement made by her superiors, the media and the FBI - who just like Richard Jewell also met an untimely death, having went to her grave protecting the identities of her sources. Good job by the actress though, in depicting Scruggs as a bigger-than-life figure, who isn't afraid of anything, and flaunts her sexuality at the FBI - as well as everybody else! - adding some much needed comic relief to this very serious and intense American drama.",Richard Jewell
161,soulexpress,"Good film, though not Eastwood's crown jewel (sorry)",7,3 January 2020,"Is RICHARD JEWELL a good movie? Yes. Is it one of Clint Eastwood's very best? No. It's more on a par with J. EDGAR and JERSEY BOYS than with UNFORGIVEN or MILLION DOLLAR BABY.The film benefits from a strong cast--Paul Walter Hauser, Sam Rockwell, and Kathy Bates in particular. There is also good support from Jon Hamm as the lead FBI investigator and Olivia Wilde as the reporter who outs Jewell as the main suspect in the 1996 Centennial Park Olympic bombing.Like nearly all fact-based films, RICHARD JEWELL felt about 75% fake to me. I know very little about his story, but I've seen enough of these movies to know that Hollywood plays fast and loose with the facts. To me, the least convincing aspect was reporter Kathy Scruggs' transformation from demonizer to sympathizer. And I can't help but wonder how the real-life Tom Shaw (Jon Hamm's character) and Kathy Scruggs felt about how they're portrayed here. Were they really the bad guys that the movie makes them out to be? I honestly don't know, but I'm guessing the real-life people took a more nuanced approach to the Richard Jewell affair.The film is imperfect, but I'm glad it was made.

162,kenstallings-65346,A biopic of a federal and media hatchet job,8,21 March 2020,"This is the film that former editors at the Atlanta Journal-Constitution tried very hard to prevent the public from seeing, even threatening lawsuits and engaging in a public campaign to vilify the film just weeks before its worldwide premier. Their prime charge? That the film portrayed their former reporters in a bad light.The movie does portray these two reporters in a bad light, but primarily in the light of two people who relished the opportunity to publicly accuse someone of terrorism, without first doing the most elemental of investigation to learn that there were obvious holes in the stories they were being fed by member of law enforcement, likely the FBI officers working the case.But, this movie correctly portrays these men as the real culprits in all this. In an era of Ruby Ridge, Waco, the OKC bombing, and a host of many other questionable and criminal acts, the FBI ran wild with a reckless investigation that attempted to parlay intangible profile connections into a criminal investigation. These profile elements stood in stark contrast to easily obtainable evidence. This evidence was ignored by a series of unprofessional actions.As the film shows, this included outrageously lying to Jewell to come to the FBI Atlanta station under the guise of helping them produce a training video, and then turning that ""training video"" into an ad-hoc attempt to get him to sign a written confession! The movie shows the shocking betrayal of due process of law, actions for which the agents were issued written reprimands.Yet, the claims by the FBI that Jewell fit the profile of a lone bomber were directly undermined by a simple piece of detective work that any law enforcement agency should have immediately concluded as exculpatory -- that the known timeline of the 911 call made by the actual bomber, Eric Rudolph, made it impossible for Jewell to have made that call, and been at the scene of the bombing helping clear away the people to safety.In the film, Jewell is shown as a sensitive and caring man, who goes from awkward and unsure of himself, and at times oafishly arrogant as a campus security cop,, to a person of confidence, willing to stand up to FBI officials and frankly make them question their motivations and actions.Perhaps the most poignant scene of the film is near the end when Jewell makes some very insightful comments to the FBI officers, bluntly asking them how their reckless actions might well have undermined the willingness of future people like him to act to help the public, out of fear of being railroaded like he was.For all the efforts by some in the media to try to torpedo this film, what is missed by the media is that are not portrayed as the central villains in this film, but only bit players in that effort. That role, as real villains, is reserved for federal law enforcement.Given more recent events, these actions appear all the more alarming, as this film seeks to show that those with significant power, such as federal law enforcement officers, must act in the highest degree of integrity and fairness. Leaking tantalizing morsels to a media, knowing they will print stories, is the ultimate betrayal of professional ethics.This film shows that these FBI case officers, who investigated Jewell, lacked those ethics. In the end, they were sanctioned for their conduct. We, in the end, are left with a story about how an unassuming and awkward man became a hero for a few days, then falsely portrayed as a terrorist for a few months, and then ultimately became a hero for a second and final time.It is a lesson we can all well learn from, and take heed of.",Richard Jewell

165,cappiethadog,Georgia trial,8,2 January 2020,"Watson Bryant made a call to the FBI. The lawyer had ordered his client to take a polygraph test. Richard Jewell, the alleged Centennial Park bomber, would be on the move. ""I don't have a White Bronco,"" he quips, with sarcasm, to the federal agent on the line. This exchange doesn't make it into ""Richard Jewell"", a timely film about government overreach, but ever more importantly, the recurrent downward spiral of journalism that Paddy Chayefsky, like a prophet, forewarned back in 1976, an alarm which started to ring louder seventy-two hours after July 27, 1996, with hindsight being 20/20. The documentation of this phone call derives from the movie's source, an article written less than a year after the 1996 Atlanta Summer Olympics called ""American Nightmare: The Ballad of Richard Jewell"" by Marie Brenner, which ran in the Feb. '97 issue of ""Vanity Fair"". It would be overkill, rhetoric-wise, as would Watson's advice to the besieged security guard and his harried mother Bobi. ""Do not meddle,"" he tells them, after an encounter with the press outside their modest apartment, adding: ""There is nothing you can do about it. Richard knows that ""primal forces of nature"" are at work, and trying to fight it would be a foolhardy pursuit. The filmmaker and the lawyer on the page were on the same page. They both knew what cultural touchstone the word ""meddle"" signified. When Watson(Sam Rockwell) barges into the press room of The ******* *******-********** to confront reporter Kathy Scruggs(Olivia Wilde), he uses an Oz reference, ""pulling back the curtain"", which is meant to demean the journalist who broke the factually wrong story, as a person disproportionate to the power she wields. But Watson knows better. The reporter who ""started a wildfire"" isn't the Wizard. The lawyer just needs to put a face on the machine that he ca yell at. Oz is not some faraway distant world somewhere over the rainbow; it's here, and the wizard is a corporation, a person, technically, as defined by the U.S. Constitution's 14th Amendment. Not for nothing did Watson Bryant, in the Brenner article, evoke Paddy Chayefsky when he advised his client to stand-down and let the press do their job, however unfair, the job of 24-hour surveillance. Richard Jewell was being railroaded, plain and simple. Because of the 14th Amendment, corporations were afforded the same legal rights as people. This amendment was most applauded by the railroad industry. It would grow in power after the turn of the century. Somebody wrote a book about it. And then they adapted the book for the screen.""Network"", directed by Sidney Lumet, like any film about the news industry since Peter Finch, playing UBS anchorman Howard Beale, rose from his chair and shouted: ""I'm mad as hell and I'm not going to take it anymore!"" live on-air, proved that Paddy Chayefsky was a better prophet than George Orwell, when he rightly predicted with uncanny accuracy the merging of divisions, entertainment and news. ""Richard Jewell"", directed by Clint Eastwood, is just the latest. CCA, a multinational corporation, has just been installed as UBS' new overlords, headed by Frank Hackett(Robert Duvall), who fires Max Schumacher(William Holden), the news division president, after he decries with impotence: ""All you graverobbers care about is that he's a hit."" To the grizzled old newsman's disbelief, this corporate hotshot folds the nightly news into programming. James L. Brooks, in 1987, added his own marginalia to the Chayefsky screenplay, with ""Broadcast News"", released seven years after the launching of CNN. Driven by ratings, and especially, profit margin, network or cable news needed to keep its viewer's attention, so as a result, the austerity of hard news became subordinate to sensationalism. Brooks demonstrates this adeptly at the local television news convention sequence, when Jane Craig(Holly Hunter), a producer, proves her point about content by showing footage of a Japanese dominoes tournament, causing her industry professional colleagues to go wild with applause. Eastwood, not wanting to cover the same ground as Oliver Stone's ""Natural Born Killers(akin to ""Network"" on steroids), omits the lawyer's allusion to O.J.'s escape vehicle in the magazine article, but the audience understands that Richard Jewell(Paul Walter Hauser) was a casualty of ""tabloid television"". Hauser, ironically enough, portrays Shawn Eckhart, Nancy Kerrigan's attacker in Craig Gillespie's ""I, Tonya"", which recounted ""Icegate"", the non-event that turned the extrapolations of ""Network"" into reality. The natural born killers in ""Richard Jewell"" is the FBI and the media. Agent Tom Shaw(Jon Hamm) and Kathy Scruggs are stand-ins for Mickey and Mallory. When the FBI Agent leaked Richard's good name to The ******* *******-************ reporter, they killed an innocent man's reputation. Scruggs turned the Centennial Park bombing into pulp fiction, confusing it with true crime, her predominating writing style, which came from years of being a veteran on the police beat. At the crime scene, Ron Martz(David Shaw), the co-writer who shares Kathy's byline, joins the female writer in a prayer, co-opted by journalism; an ideology shared by UBS' programming director Diana Christensen(Faye Dunaway), whose life is described by Max as ""a shrieking nothingness""; an atheist who calls Howard Beale a ""processed instant God"". Television is her religion. She prays to The Mad Prophet of The Airwaves because he can giver her ""a 30 share and a 20 rating"". In ""Richard Jewell"", Ron looks at his colleague aghast when they hold hands while she asks God that the bomber be ""interesting"", or in other words, have entertainment value, since breaking this story has the potentiality of catapulting her to fame. She knows how the 24-hour news cycle works. A mass murder with a charismatic perpetrator is a story with legs. But Kathy Scruggs didn't create Richard alone. She had help. Dr. W. Ray Cleere(Charles Green) played a part in spawning the reality television program about an innocent man who sees his whole world go topsy-turvy by the court of public opinion, faster than you can say ""dingo stole my baby"". The Piedmont College president, Richard Jewell's former boss, made that initial call to the FBI, claiming that the supposed limelight-seeking celebrity was in possession of a ""hero complex"" during his employment at the tiny liberal arts school in Georgia. And yes, the audience sees Richard being summoned to Dr. Cleere's office after numerous complaints from students and faculty alike. The ""rent-a-cop"" enters dorm rooms and conducts illegal searches on mere kids with too heavy a hand. Richard, in defense of himself, reminds the school president what he told the rent-a-cop during their first meeting: ""I don't want any Mickey Mousing on my campus."" Arguably, Richard was just doing his job. The famous cartoon mouse, not coincidentally, shares the same name as the modern-day Clyde(Woody Harrelson), who becomes a tabloid television sensation due to his exposure on ""American Maniacs"", hosted by Wayne Gale(Robert Downey Jr.). The first-run theatrical release of ""Natural Born Killers"" overlaps with Richard's time at Piedmont. The media, time being a benefactor of truth, was Mickey Mousing around with Richard Jewell. No doubt about it.Bobbi Jewell(Kathy Bates), Richard's mom, loved Tom Brokaw. ""Such a handsome man,"" she remarks, with her head turned away from the TV, sitting there like an enemy in plain sight, while the NBC talking head speaks from his electronic pulpit that beams out to millions of viewers across the land. When two agents, dressed casually, solicit Richard at the Jewell home for the making of a training video down at FBI headquarters, Bobbi senses that something has gone awry after they leave. She turns on the television. The mother, so proud of her son, gets her first glimpse of the looking glass, an alternate universe where Richard Jewell, the hero, metamorphosises into R., a monster, put on trial in the court of public opinion, as if Franz Kafka came down to Georgia. The handsome man Bobbi thought so highly of, tells the American public that his son planted the bomb which claimed two lives. Somebody, or somebodies, pulled the strings on these various news outlets and decided on Richard Jewell's guilt because it was good for rating and made these anonymous corporate overlords a ton of money in advertising revenue. An experienced anchorman knows better than to try a man for some capital crime in the public domain. Going against the grain, speaking truth to power, however, could have resulted in a ""Network""-like scenario, in which Arthur Jensen(Ned Beatty) stares down Howard Beale across a mile-long table and commands him to tow the company line. To have voiced the opinion of Richard Jewell's innocence before his trial was tantamount to ""meddling with the primal forces of nature"". It's called editorializing, but what the media did, in essence, was lie. The FBI had nothing on him, except a bogus ""false hero"" profile that never existed until Richard Jewell first spotted the backpack, conspicuous only to him, tucked under a bench near the sound and light tower during a live concert with thousands of people in attendance. When Howard Beale proclaimed: ""You're not getting any truth from us,"" he wasn't mad, after all.""You don't matter,"" Watson tells his client. It's nothing personal, when Richard asks: ""How can they do that?"" after Nadya(Nina Arianda), the lawyer's secretary, informs the group about bugs in the Jewell apartment. Corporations have more rights than people. Watson, a yeller, wants Richard to be a yeller, too, especially after the FBI confiscates all of his stuff for testing. Richard's cooperation with the feds infuriates him.Watson, in essence, wants Richard Jewell to get off the sofa, stick his head out the window, and shout: ""I'm mad as hell and I'm not going to take it anymore!""""Are they yelling in Atlanta?"" Diana asked back in 1976.",Richard Jewell
166,elision10,Entertaining but misleading,3,22 October 2020,"I never understand why it's OK for a movie to change key details of a true story in the name of artistic license w/o saying so. If you want to do a fictionalized account of an event a lot like the one in Atlanta, then don't call it Richard Jewell. The fiction that really gets me is that the AJC reporter slept with the FBI agent for information. If Richard Jewell's own lawyer against the AJC says that's not true, how can you show it that way? In the movie, this transfer of information is clearly transactional, not that they were already FWBs or F' Buddies or whatever the kids are calling it these days. The reporter is dead and can't defend her name. But some of the other made-up stuff -- like the character of the FBI agent, which was highly fictionalized, or that the the FBI tried to get Jewel to record his voice without his lawyer's knowledge, which apparently is not true -- is also disturbing. Even the go-it-alone lawyer turns out to be wrong, as one suspects it was -- surely at some point a criminal attorney would have been called in. All this stuff DOES matter because we viewers see it and believe the worst of the FBI and the media. What happened to Richard Jewell was wrong, but this movie is ethically not much better.",Richard Jewell
167,hines-2000,OUTSTANDING story that must be told,10,16 December 2019,"The tagline should be, 'The movie journalists don't want you to see!' They are ranting that a journalist is portrayed in a bad light. Oh please, stop the presses! Talk about pot calling kettle black. Liberal filmmakers relentlessly produce propaganda films detrimental to conservatives before an election; Clint Eastwood picked the perfect topic and accurately portrayed their duplicity. We can't begin to fathom the number of lives the FBI and media have successfully destroyed. Richard Jewell is a film that accurately depicts the FBI and the news media as they tormented a hero they knew to be innocent and stopped searching for the guilty man who did 3 more bombings. So yes let's talk artistic license. There is a difference between ""Richard Jewell"" as a movie and MSM treatment of Richard Jewell. On one hand we have a fictionalized event with artistic license for dramatic purposes on something to fit a narrative. The other is a movie. So please media stop the pretense of comparing a dramatization to actual destruction of human lives which you have been guilty of on numerous occasionsEvery actor on the set poured out every bit of soul and emotion they had. Every one of the main characters gave an award worthy performance. However, I would say Paul Walter Hauser is the life blood of the movie. I think every free person could identify with his anguish. This could be anyone of us destroyed by a powerful agency who abuses their power as the FBI clearly did. It is still happening today and the world is watching.

169,brianjohnson-20043,Solid movie,8,23 January 2020,"I've recently become very interested in the topics of epistemology, logic, logical fallacies, and understanding what does and doesn't count as evidence.This movie explores these topics by studying the players in the real event of the 1996 Olympics. I know some of the information was dramatized for the movie. But the dynamic between the protagonists seems mostly genuine and believable. And that's what I'd argue really matters most in exploring this story. I'd prefer if the narrative of the villainous media and FBI characters were accurate, detailed and interesting. But given the nature of the people and their mistakes, it seems their accounts being detailed and accurate is impossible. So the writers opted to make their story likely somewhat artificial, but detailed and interesting. And although one can't be sure that this or that happened in this or the other particular way, the end result of their behavior was the same as the result we see in the picture.The movie is well-acted, particularly by Kathy Bates. The story is told in a simple linear fashion which works well for this story. It explores how difficult it can be to be a hero when you don't have the stereotypical resume of a hero. And how quickly a seeming hero can be cast as a villain when people start thinking conspiratorially.Richard Jewel is both an admirable and annoying character at the same time. His naive conduct really gets on the viewers nerves. But he manages to learn something and stand up for himself in the end. This dynamic makes the middle and end of this story more entertaining than one night otherwise expect. Although I love moves like Spotlight and All the President's Men, it's good to reminded that the media can cause a lot of harm when it doesn't sufficiently fact-check what they're reporting.It's nice that this film came out after Richard was completely cleared as a suspect. Otherwise there might be a reason to be annoyed by the way he mostly positively portrayed in spite of some questionable behavior.I think I gave it 8 stars rather than 10 is because the story isn't spectacular, but good. And the growth for the main character was somewhat difficult for me to believe. I feel this last issue could have been fixed with a scene or two of Richard and his lawyer practicing practicing his responses to potential FBI questions before the climatic scene.",Richard Jewell

171,Willie-12,"Solid Direction, Phenomenal Acting, & Powerful Story = One Of The Best Films Of The Year",9,27 December 2019,"I knew that Richard Jewell was going to be a well directed film with Clint Eastwood at the helm. I knew the acting would be phenomenal with the likes of Kathy Bates and Sam Rockwell (one of my favorite actors) playing crucial supporting roles. I was pretty sure that the screenplay would be solid with Billy Ray writing it, who, for the most part, has written some very good films (Shattered Glass, State Of Play, Captain Phillips, etc.). But what I wasn't quite prepared for was the performance by Paul Walter Hauser. If there is any justice in the land of Hollywood, Hauser will get an Academy Award Nomination for Best Actor. I have rarely seen a performance more powerful, more heartbreaking, and more beautiful than the performance by Hauser in this film. And he may even deserve to win the Oscar (but, most likely won't in a year where, it would seem, Joaquin Phoenix is destined to win for his brilliant performance in Joker). Now, obviously the story of Richard Jewell is more complicated than what the audience sees in this movie. But that is always the case when a true story is adapted to the world of film. Dramatic license always has to be accounted for. But what this film did do very effectively, is portray just how destructive the phenomenon of tunnel vision combined with an over-zealous media, can be. The bottom line is this: When it comes to the FBI and the American media outlets wrongly accusing someone of crimes they never committed...well they can, and often do, destroy people's lives in a heartbeat. Even though Jewell was no longer considered a suspect in the case of the bombing in Centennial Park, the years that followed were years that were very hard on him and his family. Even when one is proven to be innocent in a case like this, there are always going to be people who still wonder to themselves, ""hmm...but still...who knows...maybe."" There is a stain that stubbornly tarnishes the wrongly accused even though there shouldn't be. Which meant for Jewell, the years that ended up being the last years of his life, were spent trying to deal with and cope with an injustice of the highest order. After the Summer Olympics in Atlanta, Jewell was never quite the same. And when Eric Rudolph, the real bomber, finally accepted a plea deal in 2005, which fully exonerated Jewell (as Rudolph admitted that it was he, and he alone who was responsible for the bombing) Jewell would only live for another 28 months. This is why I commend Clint Eastwood for telling this story. And what a powerful story it is. Indeed, Richard Jewell is one of the best films of the year.",Richard Jewell

174,Benslie,Deserves way more attention,10,20 December 2019,"First of all, the acting in this movie is outstanding from everybody. There was no stand out to me because honestly, everybody was giving it their all in this movie. Paul Walter Hauser was incredible as the title character and as I said, in the beginning, I know nothing about what happened but he seemed to be acting like how I would picture him acting. His chemistry with Sam Rockwell, who plays his attorney/friend Watson Bryant, was unbelievable. There are so many scenes that showcase it but there's one scene at the end of this movie that drives it home how great of friends they were. Kathy Bates, who plays Bobi Jewell, deserves an award for her performance because she was giving it her all in this role and there's one scene in this movie that really showcases it and it nearly brought me to tears. Honestly, this movie was such an emotional ride to go on because the entire time I just wanted to walk up to the FBI agents and slap them. This movie doesn't show the press side or the investigation process but Richard Jewell's side of it and not many movies do that and I'm happy that this movie did that because people need to see what he was going through. This movie pretty much is showing us the audience that with the news and media we aren't getting the whole story only facts and sometimes it can't be trusted. Honestly, this movie is worth checking out at least once because it's well-acted, directed and for the story even if you don't know anything about what happened because I looked into it and other than one or two things that were changed everything that you see did happen. In the end, Richard Jewell is a movie that deserves more attention not just at the box office but also the awards.",Richard Jewell

177,TheAnimalMother,Clint Eastwood just keeps making great films...,8,13 May 2020,"This is such a relevant to our times story, produced in part by Leonardo DiCaprio and Jonah Hill. It tells a fairly horrifying tale of how a person's life can literally be ripped apart by irresponsible journalism, and grasping law enforcement agencies under pressure. It's a sad but extremely important story at this moment in history. A moment in which the American mainstream media seems to have become a witch hunting outfit, commonly destroying the good names of people in the press well before their deserved due process. Perhaps the US should adopt British policy regarding crime in the media. Over there, when a person is accused or charged with a crime, the media is not allowed to report on it until there has been a court descision. I think people on this side of the pond are really starting to see why this is a much more reasonable way to go about it. That people are innocent until proven guilty is an idea in which our modern society was supposedly built upon. In recent times however, the mainstream media seems to be trying to mess with this important human right, and are often steam rolling certain people well before their day(s) in court. Something has to change about the current irresponsible media circus that has become so mainstream in America. I applaud this film and all involved.

During his time there he formed a strong bond and working relationship with attorney Watson Bryant. For once in Richard's life, Bryant treated him like a person, an equal. He leaves the firm to pursue a career in law enforcement, he is hired as a sheriffs deputy but through one way or another is short lived. Jewell next is hired as a security guard for a local college where after a slew of complaints and acting out of jurisdiction and pulling cars over, a big no no as he basically impersonates the real police, thankfully only handing him slaps of the wrist and job termination. In the summer of 1996 Jewell is employed to be acting security during the Olympic games, monitoring Centennial Park. In the early morning of July 27th Richard notices a backpack left under a bench which from his past investigating is left in a very suspicious manner. A bomb expert is called after Jewell appears to be scrutinized by his fellow security teams and FBI agent Tom Shaw and is proven to actually be a bomb. Frantically yet calmly they attempt to move the crowd and despite they're best efforts the bomb detonates still in close enough proximity to still cause damage killing two people and injuring over a hundred more, he is herald a hero. Behind the scenes we see agent Shaw and a reporter named Kathy Scruggs, they share a few drinks and Jewell is named dropped as a potential suspect as he fits the profile as a 'wanna-be' police officer that would commit such a crime for glory he couldn't have reached otherwise. Scruggs runs with this slanderous story that Richard Jewell is a suspect and this proves to completely destroy his life and reputation. We learn from our own observations Jewell is 100% innocent and his old friend Watson Bryant knows that without a doubt. Next we see a public battle ensues to clear his name which becomes increasingly difficult as Jewell has an undeniable respect for authority and the FBI exploits that fact.What a wild ride Eastwood created in this film definitely not your rudimentary thriller but is thrilling all the same.

SYNOPSIS:
During the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, aspiring police officer Richard Jewell (Paul Walter Hauser) is working as security while he stumbles across a bag carrying a bomb. While law enforcement and the media praised him as a ""hero"" at first, the FBI begins to aggressively investigate the life of Richard Jewell as he becomes their number one suspect.DIRECTION:
Clint Eastwood is great. I love him as a director and as an actor in most things I've seen with him, although I struggle to feel he did something no other Director could do. I'm really glad he chose this this story to put out to the world and whether it's purposeful or not, adding his name to this project will bring this story to more people. I don't want to give him too hard of a time though, because this isn't a film meant to focus around the direction. The story/writing of this film is the focal point and he still did a very good job getting it done. To add one negative I took away, there was a moment where an interview with the real Richard Jewell played on the television as his house and it through me off a bit.WRITING:
The writing in this film was very good. It is based on a true story, so the story itself is largely what captured my attention. However, there are many movies based on or inspired by true stories where the writing couldn't really capture the heart of it and that is where the beauty of the writing lies. It's always hard to know exactly how everything went down and so whether this film is very accurate or mildly accurate, I'm glad they really focused on Richard Jewell and how it affected him and his family and how he was a real trooper through this whole process. There were a couple flaws that I did find with this film. There seemed to be some arc they were going for with Olivia Wilde's character that didn't really come to a close. Then with Tom Shaw (Jon Hamm) and Watson Bryant (Sam Rockwell), although their characters didn't have an arc to really be made with them, both of their parts ended quite abruptly. They were both vital to the story and the film didn't show me nor tell me anything about how either of those two continued after the fact. Well, there was a little info given about something Watson did, but nothing to do with Richard Jewell or his law firm that he had started (not a spoiler, was nothing integral to the story).ACTING:
The acting is so good in this film. I can't say it's Hamm's best nor does Wilde really get a chance to fulfill the arc of her character due to the writing, but none-the-less great actors. Then you have Kathy Bates and holy crap does she deserve a Best Supporting nom. All I hear is ""of course she's great, she's Kathy Bates)... AND? I'm sorry I didn't know that when you're consistently great that you should be penalized for it or receive any less attention. I get we come to expect it, but then what's the incentive to give your all if you'll just be tossed to the side, because of your positive reputation. That's totally backwards to me. Then Nina Arianda who played Nadya was awesome! She didn't have many scenes, but her back and forth with Sam Rockwell was hilarious and wonderful. Now, lets get to Paul Walter Hauser. Wow. I'm sorry, but this man is neck-and-neck with Adam Driver for me. He has not even been nominated for a Golden Globe or SAG Award? Did they even watch the film? I mean Sam Rockwell was great in this film too, but he's another one of those ""yea, but he's too good to nominate. Wouldn't be fare."" Paul Walter Hauser shows so much emotion and is SO good at being a man who is holding in his anger, because he respects law enforcement too much. Then in the scenes where he breaks are just tremendous. I will be sorely disappointed if he is not nominated this year.CONCLUSION:
Richard Jewell is a great story about one of American's greatest heroes who probably didn't get enough praise for the job that he did. The story itself and Paul Walter Hauser was enough for me to really enjoy this film, unfortunately there were some flaws with the story with some of the characters and some of the writing. In the end, I would definitely recommend this film for anyone to watch. Richard Jewell is the nicest man I have never met and this is just another story to show that doesn't matter how kind and genuine you are, you'll always have someone try to tear you down.",Richard Jewell

I'm starting with Clint Eastwood's masterful direction. He cautiously delivers the story to keep us intensely involved. Stellar and Oscar-worthy performances by Paul Walter Hauser as Richard Jewell, Kathy Bates, and Sam Rockwell. I truly believe they deserve nominations. Disappointed of the golden globes give it only one nomination to this fantastic film, and that was well deserved for Kathy Bates. I have seen many of the films of 2019 and yet a few more to come.

Academy Award nominations for Rockwell, Paul Walter Hauser & Eastwood a no-brainer if Hollywood isn't steamrolled by its internal Stasi PC Police Force. It's a truly remarkable picture primarily because of the true story and Vanity Fair piece ""American Nightmare: The Ballad of Richard Jewell"" who sadly died in 2007 at the young age of 44. It's a fair assessment to say the Media and FBI hastened his demise. Jon Hamm (Lead FBI Agent) told both Bryant (Rockwell) & Walter Hauser (Jewell) he thought Jewell was ""guilty as hell"" even after the FBI was unable to make a case against him. Six years after the Atlanta Olympic Centennial Park Bombing, Eric Rudolph admitted to the bombing (among others) and is now in Federal prison. Meanwhile, our Media and FBI still continue to make Richard Jewell mistakes, Carter Page being the latest example, proving over and over we haven't learned anything since the Richard Jewell persecution.

192,helenbassett,Richard Jewell Film Review - Clint Eastwood Directs Sam Rockwell Calling Time On Jon Hamm When The FBI Case Doesn't Add Up Against Paul Walter Hauser,10,8 February 2020,"Everyman Richard Jewell, played by the convincing Paul Walter Hauser, noticed things, and is keen to join the police, so takes security jobs, including campus 'policeman', but sometimes gets carried away with the power of the uniform. Something that later goes against him in background character interviews.Clint Eastwood directs the story of the security guard who helped avert a disaster during the 1986 Atlanta Olympics and then found himself on the hook for the bombing. Richard is loving his job doing security at the Centennial Park celebrating the Olympics with nightly rock shows. Handing out bottled water to a pregnant lady who comes to watch. Like an all round nice guy would. One night he notices a rucksack under a bench. The police think it's nothing but he tries to clear the area as a bomb disposal expert comes to take a look. Meanwhile a call is received at Control that a bomb has been placed in the park and they have 30 minutes. It's not clear whether this was relayed to the park police but inspection of the rucksack shows it's a pipe bomb. And the area is cleared asap. But not quickly enough as it detonates, killing and injuring many people.Richard saved lives that night and is a hero, with everyone praising and wanting to talk to the unassuming guy. Even wanting him to write a book. So he phones the only legal friend he has; Watson Bryant who he met as the office supply guy in a previous job. Sam Rockwell has moved into private practice with the hilarious Nina Arianda as his assistant Nadya. Don't sign anything until he's let him read it first, Watson tells him. While the law enforcement agencies fight over who has the biggest dick, Jon Hamm's FBI agent Tom Shaw wins, obviously!, saying it's federal jurisdiction.Mum Bobi, played by the Best Supporting Actress Oscar nominated Kathy Bates, is understandably so happy seeing her son (the real Richard Jewell) on tv. But the FBI are already making a case. Richard fits the lone wolf sociopath who is either in the forces, or wants to be, a would be hero, and socially awkward character who likely lives with his Mum. Richard practically wrote the psych profile. While Tom and his partner played by Ian Gomez, follow up the call about Richard's time on campus, a sneaky move by the at the time outplayed college principal. But now they are convinced that he is their man. He made the bomb call and then played the hero. Olivia Wilde plays the ball breaking Atlanta journalist Kathy Scruggs who pillow talks out of Tom that the FBI are investigating Richard Jewell. She makes the headline splash and suddenly Richard is public enemy number one. From hero to zero in three days. With the media camped outside the Jewell home for months, but no arrest.Richard couldn't have made the call, he didn't have time. A mere trifling matter for the FBI, and if you would like to come along with us we want to make a training video of what to do if you find a suspicious package, with Richard in the starring role. And Richard is anxious to help the legal authorities. He's a naive innocent, and they actually want to film him signing the confession they have prepared, just for the authenticity of the recording you understand. For real! Now Richard isn't the sharpest tool in the box but he knows that he should be talking to his lawyer. And leaves a message for Watson, well you never know says Nadya, three more cases just like this will probably pop up in the next few days. She's a hoot. And they need the work.With a lawyer on the ball the FBI aren't going to easily railroad Richard now, but god do they try. Getting him to read out the bomb warning when Watson's back is turned. Quite how they would have slipped this in I dread to think. And stripping the apartment of anything that may be linked to bomb making. Bobi is really upset about her tupperware, and quietly having a breakdown in the bugged apartment. While Richard, nightly reliving the slow motion bomb blast, watches his mother as his blood pressure boils as far as his meekness will allow. And finally ready with Watson to go to town and clear his name. When he takes an independent lie detector test he passes with flying colours. And Kathy at the tv press conference starts to realise that her nationwide scoop now shows the FBI are clutching at straws, as Bobi breaks down in front of her. Watson and Nadya walked the route, as does Kathy, and they know Richard couldn't have done it. As do the FBI who even hassle his friend because the timing doesn't fit the lone wolf profile now, so Richard must have had an accomplice. His gay boyfriend. Unlikely in gun toting Georgia with Richard's impressive collection. Plus Richard said he wanted the Security spot by the media tower to look at the pretty women.Is Clint Eastwood shining a light on the disgraceful practise of the FBI?, then yes. They had the perfect suspect and wanted to make the crime fit him. Does the media come out well? No. But they can be like a braying pack of wolves. Meghan? But Richard had nothing to hide, and they couldn't find anything on him that could make the case. And he knows it so he walks. His parting shot that next time a security guy may not respond to the threat, and just get the hell out, in case he becomes another Richard Jewell. The FBI have no answer.A terrific film and cast, I saw Jonah Hill was a producer and had been the original Richard, but Paul Walter Hauser walked away with the role. Sam Rockwell builds on his stellar career, I remember when he was a lifer on The Green Mile. Olivia Wilde and Jon Hamm played well opposite each other and Kathy Bates was a loving mother, totally ground down over the months of the case. Of course the story has been spiced up for Hollywood so certain things may not have happened quite as shown, but the incredible story is true enough.",Richard Jewell

This movie has brought up many emotions in me, sorrow, pride, anger as well....
When one wants to believe in Justice, Truth and thinking if we do what is right, then we can do no wrong, until some powerful force, like the FBI just wants to pin it on anyone, not find the real perpetrators, just find a scapegoat, as they have done many times and yet still seem to have Carte Blanche.

Sam seems to play off the wall characters and he does them well, but this movie was so much better with him playing Watson. Thank you Sam for playing Watson!I would also like to say this is one of Clints best, and he has done a lot of them. So glad to have Clint Eastwood, we have been blessed with everything he was involved in or has acted in. I can't think of any bad films, well, yes Every Which Way But Loose was fun, c mon!This story made Me sick! To see what the FBI and the media did to Richard was an atrocity to say the least. When a person is innocent it's very hard for the accusers to prove their case because their is never enough evidence. Richard was lucky he had Watson to be by his side to clear his name.Whoever the FBI agents were on this one , I hope they lost their jobs, and then to find out an anti abortion guy, Eric Rudolph, was the real bomber. You mean to tell me the FBI didn't know about this guy? They should be ashamed! I am curious if anyone in the FBI or the media lost their jobs over this sham!",Richard Jewell
199,PerryAtTheMovies,A good film that is worth two hours of your time...,7,10 January 2021,"Initial Thoughts:
My experience with Clint Eastwood films is that they usually contain interesting stories, solid characters, and great cinematography. This ""true story"" about Richard Jewell is no exception. Before I decided this was the movie to watch tonight. I was little put off by the two hour time tag. I didn't feel like watching a long movie, but the way this story flowed, two hours was done before I knew it. All that to say this was a good movie.As any ""true story"" it has its drama put in to make it more eye-catching, but the comparison I found between the true events and the movie appeared to be on par. Apparently the journalism part of the movie is a little far-fetched, but like I said, ""added drama"". While not dramatic enough to tug the heartstrings all the way, Paul Walter Hauser does a convincing job of this guy who just wants to do good for people, who has no ulterior motives in how he conducts himself, and never wants the spotlight. Kathy Bates also compliments the story with a great emotional performance as Richard Jewells mother, Bobbi. She is part of what made the film good as you could feel the pain of all the drama her and her son were going through.Lastly, while everything flowed seamlessly, and appeared to be true to the real event. I did feel like parts were missing. Yes, the FBI was hounding this guy because they were convinced it was him, but what was the media really doing on their end to fuel this story? What and where did they get their information for their papers and broadcasts? Maybe this is benign to the story, but it's just that little bit extra that could've made the movie a little better. Still, this was a good film.Overall:
I truthfully think that one could fall anywhere between loving or hating this movie. I thought it was good and would watch it again. Don't let the two hour time tag be off putting because everything flows so seamlessly. It's over before you know it. If you asked me, ""Should watch this movie?"" My answer is, 'yes'.Enjoy the show!",Richard Jewell
200,three8s2013,"Kathy Scruggs of The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, slept with an FBI agent to get information on the investigation.",7,9 August 2020,"Kathy broke the story that security guard Richard Jewell was the focus of the
bombing. Irresponsible journalism. Kathy went to her grave protecting the identities of her sources. She died in 2001.A good slow burn movie. The FBI real bumbled this investigation. Richard was a bit weird but there was no evidence to accuse him. The bombing happened a year after Oklahoma and Timothy McVeigh so the pressure was on but still a poorly investigated crime.",Richard Jewell
201,warthogjump,Rockwell and Hauser's show!!,9,8 March 2020,"Where are the Oscar noms for Hauser and Rockwell? The chemistry between the two characters, Hauser's honest, but sort of dopey character and Rockwell's kind, but ruthless legalistic attitude, is amazing. So much works between these two characters naturally. In addition, Rockwell's dark humour towards Richard Jewell is just plain hilarious. However, equally extraordinary is Hauser's typical and serious response to what the viewer might find somewhat amusing.In this movie, you can really feel for Richard Jewell as mere kindness and honesty prove to be weaknesses to a corrupt society and legal system, but similarly it also shows that kindness and honesty can out you in touch with similar hearted people who may be ruthless enough to defend power when it may seek to take advantage of the weak. I thought Hauser was absolutely amazing in the role, and that Sam Rockwell has simply added to his list of pitch perfect performances mostly of a varied nature. Rockwell evidences his strong acting capability with so much enjoyment watching his character in every scene and the best part is he simply rocks!! He is just harsh enough to be a good defence attorney, but also just kind enough to only be ruthless to those who deserve it. I think there was no reason to omit these two fantastic performances from the Oscars this year.",Richard Jewell
202,thescholar22,Really Shows You What Happens When The Wrong Person is Accused Without Research First,8,1 February 2021,"I didn't really know much about this guy until the trailer came out so I looked him up on Wikipedia.Basically in 1996 Atlanta Olympics this security guard Richard Jewell discovered this bomb at the place and told the cops. Later the cops and FBI look into him and think he might of done it. Though in this movie it just feels like they didn't pay attention to what actually happened or just blamed him because it was easier than doing the research. Richard Jewell also in this feels like he's trying to be a good citizen but isn't too bright at times.There's also this lady reporter that feels like she just wanted a trending story until she finds out she was wrong. That was pretty nice though since she admitted it and didn't blame it on something or someone else. Other people in this movie didn't feel too genuine, like they blamed Richard for this because of the painfully obvious and didn't want to do the research. Though I'm sure back in 1996 we still actually tried, did the work, and had integrity.It's just really sad how the media hounded him and that the FBI had to take stuff from his house. Also feels like if this happened in present day with social media and everything Richard would be complete destroyed and would probably commit suicide. 6 years later they found the real bomber but it feels like after Richard Jewell was investigated that it stung his reputation.I also heard the media when this movie came out didn't want you to watch it since it makes the media look bad, I'm just like YOUR POINT! Since this movie showed you that the media doesn't get everything right the first time. It just feels like today we lack modesty and humility to understand or know when we're wrong and not always right all the time.Give it a watch when you can and I found it on HBO MAX. It just feels like today we lack actual, genuine, down to earth heroes. And these so called heroes like celebrities and those superhero movies and comics today just feel like they do all this for fame or barely sacrifice anything.",Richard Jewell

This was a good and very well done movie by Clint Eastwood.

A very compelling film about Richard's journey",Richard Jewell
211,Bachfeuer,"A wiser, better Clint Eastwood",8,18 December 2019,"Compare the wretched perp to whom Dirty Harry says, ""Make my day!"" or ""Do you feel lucky?"" with Richard Jewell. Agent Tom Shaw expresses the very attitudes Eastwood used to hold. (Jon Hamm's performance, his best since MAD MEN, is a welcome relief from the wooden officials he has played lately.) Eastwood deserves a lot of credit for coming such a long way from the 2012 empty chair episode. As a hotelier back in the 90s, handicapped access laws were the bane of his existence. I thought he made MILLION DOLLAR BABY as a hate letter to the wheel chair handicapped who had cost him a lot of money. Frankie Dunn did one of them a favor by offing her. I despised Eastwood for that, and lamented those who tried to find some sort of enlightened death-with-dignity message in it. He has redeemed himself in my eyes. I'll bet there's more to come. (I hope he will make his cheap shot at Kathy Scruggs right, for starters.)",Richard Jewell

214,gcarpiceci,"Like Sully, a movie made out of a non-story",4,24 February 2020,"Richard Jewell reminded me of Sully as a movie made out of a non-event. Flight 1549 was - except for its passengers - a total non-event: a few seconds of flight, a very skilful emergency landing in the Hudson, none injured, let alone dead. There was a routine NTSB investigation afterwards which finally cleared the captain. What's the story here?
Same goes for Richard Jewell: in a country where judicial errors have dramatic and devastating effects (When They See Us, Just Mercy, just to mention a couple of the most recent movies on the subject), his story is at best trivial and irrelevant.
A story-less movie, even if well directed and well acted as this one, will only turnout a bland movie.",Richard Jewell
215,montgomerysue,forget politics - this is mesmerizing,9,26 December 2019,"This movies grabs you from the first scene with the introduction of the Richard Jewell character and doesn't let up until the very last frame. Almost all of us know his story, but Clint Eastwood tells it in a manner that is captivating from start to finish, with details that are revelatory. The acting here is terrific all around, with Paul Walter Hauser and Kathy Bates (amazing here) deserving Oscar nominations, but consideration should also be given to Sam Rockwell as Jewell's attorney. Jon Hamm, Olivia Wilde, and Nina Arianda deserve mention, too, for their excellent characterizations. The direction is taut, crisp, and engaging and the story unfolds with wonder and precision. Some national critics are hung up on trying to politicize Eastwood's motives - but this is simply an American story that reveals the worst of our media and government. If it could happen to Richard Jewell, it could happen to you or your child. Kudos all around for this production. Like ""Once Upon a Time In Hollywood"", ""Knives Out"", and ""Judy"", (three other best movies of 2019) this holds your attention throughout and the movie flies by. Two hours seems like one. (Saw this with three other people and they all agreed.)",Richard Jewell

217,faroukgulsara,The Fourth Estate has vested interest,8,16 February 2020,"The press and the print media are often referred to as the 'Fourth Estate' or 'Fourth Power' for a reason. It is supposed to act as an extension of the arms of governance after the legislation, execution and the judiciary branch of Government of rule via indirect public influence.It traditionally played the role of the eye of the public to create a check and balance system of the ruling Government. Over the years, we have noticed that it is no longer working towards the well-being of the common man, but rather have the welfare of the financiers at heart. With financiers having vested interest in how a piece of particular news should be presented, the truth is somehow lost in the rabble-rousing. The same message can be displayed by different stations leaving totally different impressions on the public.So, leave to the public to assess what is right and which is fake, you say. History has proven time and again that people are fickle-minded. Like Pavlov's dog, they can be easily conditioned by their masters. Their opinion changes anywhere the wind blows. With access to social media to opine their two-cents worth literally at their fingertips, arranging a trial by media is an easy task.The question of exposing too much 'truth' to the public domain and having a trial by media has been popping quite rampantly in Malaysia after the change of Government. Traditionally, in Malaysia, the Fourth Estate has been functioning more like a Fourth Branch of the Government, working well as a propaganda machine of the ruling Government. The old Government is feeling the heat as many of their shenanigans out in the open. They cry foul citing loss of sovereignty of the nation as we go on a rampage washing dirty linen in public.One thing people forget is that foreign investors come to our country not because we are trustworthy and virtuous. They come here precisely for the opposite reasons. Our leaders are easy to be bought over, and everything has a price.The modern society talks about the need for a free press and freedom of information. The film shows one of the dangers of the unabated flow of information.Richard Jewell is a timid man who lives with his mother and goes on by working as a security officer. It was 1996 and Atlanta was hosting the Centennial Olympics. During the tour of his duty as a security helper in a stadium, he notices an unattended bag. He alerted the police officers who confirmed that it contained a bomb. Jewell helped to evacuate the public from danger, prevent a catastrophe. He is hailed as a hero, and his pictures are plastered on all newspaper. Three days later, everything takes a 180-degree turn. He is reported to be a possible prime suspect as the bomber in the bombing. News leaks that FBI thought that Jewell fit the profile of a lone attacker - single white male, living with his mother, fascinated with guns who clamours a law enforcement career.The rest of the movie is to shows the humiliation, public scrutiny and trial by media that Jewell and his mother endure. Under the name of national security and the thirst for the round-the-clock instant information, people's life is turned topsy-turvy.The film created controversy when it suggested that the journalist, Kathy Scruggs, who leaked the information about the FBI investigations on Jewell being the possible suspect obtained it by providing sexual favours.The saga affected Jewell and Scruggs profoundly. Both had premature deaths. Jewell succumbed to heart ailments, and Scruggs went on to be bogged with depression. She died on morphine overdose. The possibility of suicide was also considered.Jewell's name did get cleared by FBI after all. In his time, he sued many newspapers and news networks including CNN. He got a fat compensation but, it seems, the bulk of it went to the lawyers' fees.That is the bane of modern living - create a molehill out of nothing, make a big deal out of it, talk about principle and doing the 'right' thing but basically doing nothing but create a whole lot of mess. In comes the lawyers (or maybe bankers too) as the knights in shining armours. They prolong the confusion, build up anxiety and leave with a load of money, giving the impression of saving the day. To those affected, nothing really changes.",Richard Jewell
218,Hex_0mega,Another glimpse of the corruption that lies within federal investigations,8,3 January 2021,"It seems like in many cases, teams of investigators, be it local authorities or the FBI, just want to nail someone whether there is any evidence or not just so they can put the case to rest and be done with it. Its really sickening, and its something that happens all the time. This is how innocent people spend years in prison, or even get sentenced to death and by the time the truth comes to light, its too late and someone has already been executed or been imprisoned for years that they can't get back. Luckily, Richard Jewell did not suffer one of these fates, but he came awfully damn close.A man who did the best he could to save lives ends up becoming a lead suspect in a bombing at a park event at which he was serving as a security gaurd. After noticing an abandoned backpack, he realizes that it could be hosting a bomb and as a result of him notifying the police and people at the event, he saved many lives that night.Recognized as a hero the following few days after, the FBI then turns the tables on him and targets him as the main suspect in the bombing. It is scary for Richard, and he knows he shouldn't be crucified by the FBI for something he didn't do, but he only wants to cooperate. If his character is very accurately portayed in this movie, I'd say he was possibly even mildly autistic. I say this because in some ways, the way he acted and handled stuff sorta reminded me of myself. If theres any truth to that suspicion, it would be an especially scary experience.It is a very solid film though, and I think Clint Eastwood did a great job directing. Its sad that this happens to people.",Richard Jewell

Then we get to see how destructive the game can become, with little care for the truth, just looking for more headlines, true or not. This was in 1996, and it's far worse than ever today. Solid performances from the leads and as always by Kathy Bates. Eastwood does a marvelous job of getting you on the side of a pretty awful person, but that said, the way he was treated was appalling.

Most of the characters are likeable but there is one that I am not a fan of. The movie is also well shot. The movie is very well scripted and the story is well executed. But there is problems with this movie for sure. The movies pacing is very slow and the movie really could of been alittle shorter there is a lot of scenes they could of cut out of this movie to make it shorter. The reporter in this movie is so unlikeable her character just comes across as annoying. The movie also try's to be funny bad sadly the jokes don't land.

Sam Rockwell, god bless him for having the best agent in Hollywood, is always a treasure to watch. Paul Walter Hauser is so natural and talented as Jewell. Kathy Bates, Olivia Wilde and Jon Hamm all take the cake and nail it. I never knew the story of the '96 bombings or of Jewell, but this movie does a fantastic job highlighting what happened and makes it into a very dramatic and sad story. It'll make you cry, it made me cry, it's one of the most dramatic things I've seen. It's quite clear that Eastwood cared about this story and telling it to people.

He was terrific and gave me a real sense of a man who really tried hard to follow the rule of law and be someone people could count on to protect them.This is based on a true story about Richard Jewell, who was pretty much a loner, lived with his mother Bobi (Kathy Bates), and wanted to be part of the law enforcement community all his life.When we first engage with Jewell, he's a supply clerk in a company and we see that he is thoughtful and careful about his work. We are shown this as he overhears a loud, aggressive telephone conversation by Watson Bryant (Sam Rockwell) and a client of the company they work for.Apologizing for overhearing the conversation (there's no way he couldn't hear), he tells Watson to look in a drawer because Jewell has filled it with the pens Watson uses in his work. Also, asking Bryant to open another drawer, it is filled with Snickers candy bars, the snack food Bryant eats when stressed.Through this interchange, hey become acquaintances and chat from time to time. One day Jewell gets a job offer to be a security guard at a local college campus. Saying goodbye to Bryant is very sweet. Bryant caught off guard, gives him a $100 bill in case he might need anything during the transition between jobs. Jewell is touched, and for him, their friendship is now rock-solid.At his new job, he has a run-in with some students who are breaking campus rules and he gets fired for this and because he's overstepping his bounds by stopping cars on the highway near the campus looking for drugs.These things highlight a couple of things about Jewell, he believes in following the rules, and he can and will step outside the bounds of his authority.Getting a job as a security guard for AT&T at their sponsorship of events at Centennial Park as part of the celebrations for the 1996 Atlanta Olympics in Atlanta, GA. His thoughtfulness and kindness are highlighted here, as well. Providing water or Coca Cola to pregnant women so that they do not become dehydrated, and he also supplies the lighting and filming crew in the nearby tower with food or other things they need. He wants to be helpful.He's also looking for suspicious items and people. When he discovers a backpack that has been left under a bench where he was sitting, he tells the police. The police team brings in some experts and they realize it is a bomb. While moving the crowd back, the bomb explodes, and two people are killed, and many others are injured.At first, he's seen as a hero and is on television. He's proud of his work, and his mother is especially pleased because her favorite newscaster, Tom Brokaw, spoke glowingly about her son.FBI Agent Tom Shaw (Jon Hamm) was also stationed at the park and is disappointed that he was stationed there, and even worse, something happened on his watch, and he didn't prevent it. After interviewing Jewell's past records and after meeting with the college who fired Jewell, Richard becomes a suspect. What does Jewell do when he realizes the FBI is considering him a suspect, he calls Bryant.Local newspaper columnist Kathy Scruggs (Olivia Wilde), who only wants to make a name for herself, uses her sexuality towards Shaw to extract this FBI probe about Jewell. She writes an unconfirmed expose front-page article in the newspaper, and in a New York minute, it jumps up to become national headlines.Now Jewell is seen as the vilified criminal, not the hero, all in a span of about a week.The film then tells the story of how his friendship with Bryant and the undying support of his mom, and longtime friend Brandon Walker (Mike Pniewski) help him through the onslaught of the rush to judgment people - the FBI and Media.I did find it interesting that this film has come out when both the FBI and the Media are under a public spotlight and scrutiny.Hauser needs to receive an Oscar nomination for his portrayal of Jewell. He was terrific in bringing this confused, caring man to life. His sincerity, thoughtfulness, and helpfulness (even at the wrong times) are excellently portrayed. Rockwell gives yet another robust and stunning performance as Jewell's friend and attorney. His sarcasm and pointed jabs at the FBI's flawed work were excellent. Hamm was good, but it would be nice to see him in a role where drinking and sex are not his only motivation. Wilde was all over the place and enjoyable as Scruggs, who clearly had only one thing on her mind, fame. Bates was terrific as Jewell's mother. Her demonstration of faith in her son and that he wasn't who people were making him out to be, was sublime. Nina Arlanda, as Watson Bryant's office manager and friend, Nadya Light, brought a beautiful blend of humor and persistence to Bryant's actions. Billy Ray wrote an outstanding screenplay that was crisp and painted each character entirely. Clint Eastwood did an excellent job of directing this story. He is usually efficient in telling stories and here he stepped it up a notch.Overall: This was a wonderfully entertaining film and brought to life a story I read about some twenty-three years ago.",Richard Jewell

230,blazesuncaster,A very serious heartfelt film,9,3 January 2020,"Clint Eastwood has done it again. He has made another awesome film. My god this was good. I was excited for it but like man it blew my expectations away. The story was just so beautifully executed and written. The acting was superb. Let me just get this out of the way and just that Paul Walter Houser did an AMAZING job with this character. Every scene he acted almost made me shed a tear. There was one scene in particular that gets into the spoiler range but in this scene, he's sitting at a table and he starts crying while he's eating a donut, I literally couldn't take the smile off my face while watching this scene. This movie isn't just a hero film. It's also a friendship film. ""How far will friends go to help other friends."" This was definitely one of 2019s most underrated films. Soooo good.",Richard Jewell
231,hlee-74887,🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆,10,26 May 2020,"Add this film to the list of classics in Clint Eastwood's portfolio. Richard Jewel is the cautionary tale for the world that chases headlines and ignores the content. He is accused of a capital crime punishable by death, but is he really the terrorist? So what is he? A kind hearted man who wants to believe in justice. Someone who thinks telling the truth will set him free. Maybe too simple and gullible, if you want to believe that. I saw him as a man with a strong sense of ideals. That one person that actually believes law enforcement will not go after an innocent man. That one person who thinks federal employees work under the highest standards. I mean they won't just make up a story even as the death penalty is in effect.....right?Great film. I was disappointed in his last film ""the mule"" but this one is a winner. His portrayal of a world gone mad with endless information through technology is a real problem. Why? Because on a long enough timeline, no one is mistake free. There is always something you did or said that can be used against you. There is always something in your life the media would sensationalized. In other words, even without corroborating evidence, they can still portray anyone to be guilty.",Richard Jewell
232,gabethurau,A solid movie,7,14 July 2020,"I think what's most impressive about the movie is how well Sam Rockwell and Paul Walter Hauser worked together.Another great aspect of the film was the exploration of truth from opposite spectrums:Richard was an idealist who believed (still believes?) that authority and lawfulness is the highest form of good.The FBI agent (Jon Hamm) and journalist (Olivia Wilde) found that absolute truth was irrelevant - instead, they opted for a ""good enough"" angle to fill the void left by the suspect at large.It was interesting to see a momma's boy with arrested development stick to his guns and become the hero he had always imagined himself to be. Only for that to turn into a sobering nightmare about the non-fixedness of law.",Richard Jewell

I had researched the real ""Richard Jewell"" suffice to say the main actor was amazi g Kudos looked like him and acted him to the T........
I loved the entire cast ( sam, kathy Bates, and Olivia Wilde) not to forget to mention Jon Hamm and Ian Gomez that they acted so well i felt like throwing them against the wall lol.
I love the mocie it showed heart, a naiveness that at times its refreshing......... I think the movie made certain Justice to the real Richard Jewell..
Loved it. Very Good. Wouldnt.mind seeing it again...
It definitely capture the story of a kind hearted soul who was attacked by the media and the witch hunt behind it.......",Richard Jewell

236,politicidal,Great example of a true hero turned false villain by bad press and slander,8,19 December 2019,"No one except for Richard Jewell, his mother, and his lawyer comes out looking good. The FBI, the media, public opinion. It's disconcerting but if you have a good lawyer, you may stand a chance.Paul Walter Hauser is excellent as Richard Jewell, the heroic security guard who only wound up unfairly becoming a suspect at the Atlanta Olympic bombing. His psychological and mental toll from the media circus is riveting stuff. Hauser plays the part as well meaning if overzealous; reportedly Jewell's real-life demeanor. We cheer at his bravery, cringe at his awkwardness, and root for his exoneration.Sam Rockwell is very good as his acquaintance that takes up the defense as his lawyer. It's too bad about the controversy surrounding Olivia Wilde's character since she's also good in this.As far as Eastwood's recent biographical films go, it's a very good movie which takes an underdog approach to the main character. It's not as good as American Sniper but I enjoyed it more than Sully.",Richard Jewell

240,imjaredross,"Two Solid Performances, One Interesting Story",7,21 December 2019,"I was too young to remember the events of the 1996 Bombing, so this film is my first true introduction to this story and I could not wait to see it. Following the events above it tells the story of Richard Jewell who was portrayed as the bad guy in the events after the bombing. It's a classic story of a man who was framed for a crime he did not commit.Clint Eastwood is the perfect person to direct such a movie, reminding me of his past films such as American Sniper and Sully. Richard Jewell ends up being a solid movie, far better than Clint Eastwood's worst film to date which was released last year, 15:17 to Paris. It has great performances, tense moments and an intriguing true to life story.Paul Walter Hauser as Richard Jewell is incredible, finally this guy gets a role that puts him in the forefront and he supplies us with one one the best performances of the year. Kathy Bates can also not be ignored, playing Jewell's mother with such wonderful love and feebleness. It's Kathy Bates at her best.However, problems arise in this film specifically with the villain of the film played by Olivia Wilde who breaks the story of Jewell's possible involvement. They character is nothing more than over the top, one dimensionally evil. The only thing missing is the twirling mustache. She is by far the films biggest problem.However, the film pulls through with an emotional roller coaster, great performances and an interesting true story that I'm glad was finally told.",Richard Jewell
241,mjjusa-1,The obscene power of the government/FBI crushes the common man,9,18 December 2019,"A well made movie about an almost forgotten episode in American history. Eastwood has decided to direct movies about interesting, instructive, overlooked but recent stories lost in the noise of modern times. Remember the Americans stopping the terrorist on the Paris train? You probably do because of his movie about it. Remember Richard Jewell and the Atlanta Olympics bombing? Probably not, or slightly if at all...something about a fat Paul Blart-ish security guard, wasn't it? Now you'll come to know how a young, idealistic man was destroyed cynically by the forces still active in America today: the government, the FBI, major media who care not for the individual but care mightily about clearing crimes no matter how, and clicks and viewership. A riveting movie, well worth seeing.",Richard Jewell

244,moviematthewh-60783,a better biopic,8,10 December 2020,"I hadn't heard anything about sentenial park bombing or the person Richard jewel before this movie, so I came in with a clear open mind not expecting anything. I was very impressed with the film, especially the acting. there were some moments that were just filler moments to get the films runtime filled with footage, but that doesn't stir me away from everything else great in the film",Richard Jewell
245,WillsFilms,A Piece Of Media That Gave Richard Jewell The Respect He Deserved,8,1 February 2020,"Richard Jewell is a solid movie that perfectly portrays just how damaging the media can be, and how they'll twist anything for a good story, as well as the corruption of the American police force. Paul Walter Hauser delivers an incredible performance as the titular man, who you can tell was a good man trying to make the world a better place. Hauser plays the role with such In Innocense and compassion that it makes the audience sick that such a great man could go through such a horrific tarnishing from the media. Kathy Bates delivers a fantastically devastating performance as Richard's mother; Bobbi, perfectly showcasing the confusion and fear that someone put into her situation would feel. Sam Rockwell, however, steals the show as the dedicated, confident, loud lawyer; Watson Bryant. Rockwell dominates every sense that he appears in a larger than life performance. However, I do believe that this movie does suffer from pacing issues as well as the fact that it does take a few liberties with the story, particularly in the case of reporter; Kathy Scruggs, who didn't bang the story out of the FBI as portrayed in the movie. However, this movie still does a fantastic job of informing the audience of an amazing, heroic man and giving Richard Jewell the recognition he deserved. For that reason alone, I highly recommend this movie.",Richard Jewell

Paul Walter is impeccable as Jewell, down to the voice. What a performance. Kathy Bates is amazing per usual and of course Sam Rockwell kills it. I love Jon Hamm but didn't love this role for him.

249,mattclap28,A Jewel in Clint's Crown,8,3 March 2020,"Not many true event dramas can keep you captivated like Richard Jewell. Eastwood once again creates depth with his characters so you yourself feel part of the journey.Set during the Atalanta Olympics in 1996 Richard Jewell (Paul Walter Hauser) a wannabe law enforcement officer finds himself embroiled in the bombing at Centennial park. Hailed a hero initially he quickly becomes the suspect of the attack, then begins the road to gain his freedom. Trapped without evidence and guilty by media it shows how it affects when truly innocent.What really helps the film is the acting. Hauser himself is really good as Richard. Sam Rockwell never fails and is excellent as Richard's lawyer Watson Bryant. It's definitely Kathy Bates that is exceptional as Richard's mother. It maybe not be Clint's No 1 Film but it's damn good.",Richard Jewell
250,Critomaton,"A solid entry in Clint Eastwood's ""Men with Known Names"" trilogy",7,15 December 2019,"""Richard Jewell"" fits nicely in between ""Sully"" and ""The Mule"" in Clint Eastwood's series of three films based on true stories, at least based on emotional impact and quality of storytelling. Which is to say, I really, really liked ""Sully"", really liked ""Richard Jewell"", and didn't really like ""The Mule"".The core events of ""Richard Jewell"" are arguably less dramatic than those of ""Sully"", if unquestionably more tragic, and thus seemingly harder to mold into a compelling film. But this 2-hour film never drags, because it is always interesting to watch an innocent man get railroaded by people who are supposed to be doing the right thing. That is, in a ""Hey, this isn't supposed to happen in our society, but it could happen to anybody - and really did - so I'm fascinated to see how they almost got away with it and genuinely interested in how they were thwarted"" sort of way.With Sully, the antagonism of the NTSB (or was it the FAA?) agents seemed realistic and believable, but was apparently embellished for dramatic effect. While it made for great drama, a little post-viewing research shows that it was overblown, which kind of dampens (or sullies, if you'll pardon the pun) the lasting impact of the film. But still, it was an amazing story and the feel-good movie of the year, if not the decade.With ""Richard Jewell"", the Atlanta Constitution-Journal (ACJ) reporter who broke the ""Richard is a suspect"" story (played by Olivia Wilde) and the FBI agent who leaked the story to her (played by Jon Hamm) very quickly come off as villainous incompetents looking for the quick, lazy way out of doing their job.
Or, perhaps worse, the quick, cynical way of actually doing their job.It seemed a bit over the top, and I know it's the subject of real-world controversy, so I guess I owe it to the ACJ and FBI to research the veracity of this one also. But for those of us who remember the media coverage of this incident, it's not too much of a stretch to believe it went down something like this.Regardless of the controversy, what makes the movie so important is the insight it gives into a simple yet principled man who just wanted to make a difference, and who really did make a difference when it counted.The portrayal of the actual bombing was realistic yet suspenseful; it didn't overplay Jewell's role or make him some kind of superhero. In fact, it almost made you wish everyone in authority, including RJ, had done just a bit more a bit faster. It even shows RJ having dreams and wishes of having done more; these you feel were mostly because he was a good man but maybe partly also because of the pressure of the suspicion he was under.Having just binge-watched Season 3 of American Horror Story (this is not an endorsement, just a fact), it was very refreshing to see Kathy Bates in a positive, uplifting role for a change. She does a great job as Barbara ""Bobi"" Jewell; her character's emotional vulnerability provides the needed contrast to RJ's naive yet well-intentioned stoicism (which bordered on downright cooperation with the people trying to vilify him).Sam Rockwell gives a great performance as Richard's friend and lawyer, Watson Bryant. Along with Richard and Bobi, Watson rounds out the trio of personalities it apparently takes to survive the media and government ""onslaught"". Oh yeah, I guess it's really a quartet if you include Nadya, Watson's assistant, nicely played by Nina Arianda in a complete 180-degree turn from her character on Showtime's hit series ""Billions"".Paul Walter Hauser's portrayal of Richard Jewell is excellent and carries the movie and gives it gravitas (see, I resisted the urge to say ""weight"" or ""heft""). His final dialogue with the FBI brings up a really important point (that I won't spoil here), one that I never thought of throughout the whole film and perhaps not even when this was playing out in real life.There are several well-timed humorous moments in the film to help keep it afloat. There are also a few tear-jerking moments: some are expected and some - like watching the pain on Bobi's face when Tom Brokaw, a news anchor she respects, announces that her son is likely soon to be arrested - that sneak up on you.While I normally would not give much credence to the political leanings of Hollywood stars, I admit to thinking (during the film and as the credits rolled), ""Well, if actors Jon Hamm and Olivia Wilde and producers Leonardo DiCaprio and Jonah Hill all approved of this portrayal, then I suppose it wouldn't be fair to classify it as an alt-right hit piece against the media and government.""And yes, I am uneasy with the timing of this movie in the particular climate of mistrust of the media and FBI in the United States; this certainly won't help the situation. But movies are frequently a product of their times; I mean, isn't that why ""Armageddon"" and ""Deep Impact"" were released the same year? Or ""A Bug's Life"" and ""Antz""?Maybe 2019 was just the right climate in which an important story like this could be told, and Richard Jewell certainly deserves to have his story told.",Richard Jewell

The elitist left that are so quick to run with a story just for ratings, as this movie will clearly demonstrate. ""I'm walking out and not believing a thing they say from now on.

His story changed a few times. And yes, he was finally released from being a suspect, but this is the problem with Americans - everyone can be easily thrown into one of two categories: ""good guy"" and ""bad guy"". There is no in-between. Did Jewell have a bunch of outstanding parking tickets? Did he have warrants for fake cheques? But no, not according to this movie.

256,Brantford_Mark,Clint Eastwood tells us a Cautionary Tale based on Real Life,8,3 December 2020,"I'm usually not a crime drama fan, but the critic reviews of this Clint Eastwood movie were so strong I gave it a try. I'm glad I did.This is not a flashy movie. There is an economy in Eastwood's storytelling that is a marvel to watch. Also marvelous are the performances of the cast. Paul Hauser is astonishing as the humble title character. Kathy Bates got both Oscar and Golden Globe nominations as best supporting actress playing his mother. Sam Rockwell turns in a superb rendition of Jewell's lawyer and Jon Hamm is spot on as the FBI Agent in Charge.What particularly interests me is why Eastwood chose to do this movie. The 1996 Olympic bombing at Atlanta's Centennial Park of itself is worthy of a film. Clearly a compelling David & Goliath story, but my intuition is that it's his core concern for the common man. The media and governmental juggernaut that transformed security guard Richard Jewell from hero to villain is all too familiar these days.There is no doubt that this is a cautionary tale. In truth, similar injustices could befall any one of us given the wrong combination of media and governmental zeal. While the followup with Jewell 6 years after the bombing was gratifying, I can't help but think that the film missed an equally important story element. Namely, what happened to the law enforcement and media organizations afterward?Richard Jewell is a fine piece of storytelling and well worth watching. Recommended.",Richard Jewell

What happened, did Eastwood go off the rails and hollywood just too fashionable to point out senility?",Richard Jewell
259,chancellorpink,Docked For Subsequent Political Spin,7,9 August 2020,"Fine movie. Really liked Rockwell's performance. Should have been nominated. And Kathy Bates earned her nomination with her great crying scenes.The story was fairly presented. It showed Jewell's flaws, and the bad karma he put out that helped the world come back around against him. The FBI was villainized a bit, but in the end, Jewell gave them cause to suspect him by building up a crappy past, and yes, investigations often focus on innocent suspects. It's part of the job. Part of reality.Olivia Wilde's reporter was a bit cold & soulless (but sexy, as usual) and also someone doing her job, as was the entire media, in covering the story of the prime suspect in the bombing, when Jewell was, in fact, the prime suspect.So the movie ACTUALLY took a very fair and balanced approach. Good script by Billy Ray. It told the story honestly. But I must dock it ""majorly""(lol) anyway, for the sake of the very same fairness.Because for some reason (bet you can guess why), the spin on this movie became that it was about how the media is awful. Really? No. The spin is that the media picked its villain in this case. No. The spin is that the media ruined Jewell's life, as they so often ruin lives. No. That's not the movie I watched. Jewell went through a tough time in the movie I watched, yes. For 88 days. Let that sink in. 88 days.So I give this movie 1 star because when I read the awful spin, it sickens me. People are refusing to watch and absorb the reality of the movie in front of them.Do these people realize that the newspaper was exonerated by the GA Supreme Court in a protracted libel litigation, because, as ruled by the Supreme Court, they merely reported the truth. Jewell was, in fact, a target of the investigation. And do these political spin monsters distorting the story of this movie understand that it was produced, in part, with money from ""Hollywood liberals"" Leonardo DiCaprio and Jonah Hill? Bet they don't know that.So I give this movie a 1, because it makes me sad that so many people have intentionally distorted the overall story told here for political purposes.",Richard Jewell

I had already seen Star Wars over Christmas, and some other choices were unavailable. I had been curious about this movie based on a preview and decided to take a chance.And obviously, from my 10 star review, I'm very glad I did. Although the film was unmistakably brilliant, I couldn't help but feel incredibly sad throughout. I'm not afraid of that emotion and find resonance with the filmmakers who had compassion for such a story. I'm so glad there are films like this one.The performances were inspired on all fronts, and the direction and writing was remarkably clean.Overheard at the theater: ""Did you like the movie? ""I did."" ""Me too. I like a happy ending."" Interesting. It was, in terms of straight plot, but was the overall ending ""happy?"" With what the film says about the monsters who may exploit our cultural systems? Was the ending ""happy"" thematically? I suppose it was.

265,taylor_king-890-815491,"A ""Jewel""",9,21 December 2019,"We loved Clint Eastwood's film about misjudged Richard Jewell's calculated trashing by the FBI and the media which robbed him of his actual heroism providing notice of bomb at 1996 Olympics and urging people to safety. The actor Hauser who plays Jewell deserves an Oscar big-time. He is magnificent. His attorney played by Sam Rockwell forms a very convincing, necessarily combative relationship with Jewell that enables him to stand up & be the hero he is. I always like Kathy Bates, actress who portrays Richard's mom, Bobby, and she has one scene that brought tears, but i like her better in other tough chick roles. Don't worry about the first few scenes setting the stage with people bopping around to Kenny Rogers stuff at Olympics venue, kind of fake, but trust me it gets a whole better when the bomb goes off! Intense film with some great performances, go see it!",Richard Jewell
266,zentist-563-976986,"Solid movie, but one dimensional",6,7 May 2020,"I put off watching this movie until the Coronavirus lock-down gave me an incentive to watch it. My initial lack of interest was due to the subject matter. It really did not seem that it would make a very interesting movie. I was right.
It is not a bad movie as such. I watched it to the end and enjoyed it enough to rate it as a 6, but was left with two questions: 1. Why make the movie at all? and 2. Why make the way it was made?
The movie shows how the media and the government (through an agency - the FBI) combined to try and blame a terrorist incident on an innocent person. That would seem like the basis for a reasonably compelling story. However, the person they are trying to blame comes across in the movie as simply stupid. Now that may have been the case. Maybe Richard Jewell was as naive as the movie shows and the government and the press getting together to frame such a person is clearly bad but there is not enough story in the situation for a two hour movie.",Richard Jewell
267,vandykeu,Excellent movie,8,14 October 2020,"Upfront, I'm a sucker for movies involving courtrooms, newsrooms, police procedures, and/or corruption. The Wire to me is one of the greatest things put on film.Richard Jewell is as good. It is superbly acted by all of the cast, though the character of Watson Bryant as played by Rockwell is particularly outstanding, and Olivia Wilde's portrayal of Kathy Scruggs is almost as good.When I first saw the trailer, it jogged my then-teenage brain because my memory was that Jewell had done the crime (I don't think it's a spoiler to say he was innocent), and I think that reflects just how important the story is. Eastwood is telling the story pretty much as it happened, and its aim is to disrupt the public perception of that story. Given our current times, it is a particularly important story. Police corruption, media corruption, and the public's ability to misinterpret current events is as bad now as it ever was. We see glimmers of attempts to fix these problems, but we haven't gotten it right yet. Hopefully this movie helps people realize its core messages: 1) the government (and its agents) isn't necessarily on your side, and 2) most people are out to make something for themselves and/or hide their responsibility, which here, both the FBI and the media clearly do, and Jewell is stuck in the middle. That is where lots of people find themselves these days.",Richard Jewell

I just don't understand how they the timings so wrong and had to ""Rush"" the last 30/40 minutes.I felt the (true) story was pretty poorly acted overall, with some very over the top performances. The exception to this was the quite frankly outstanding performance from Paul Walter Hauser as the Title character. Almost Oscar material in my opinion.",Richard Jewell
269,tomfeller,Story of a hero who was wrongly accused,10,3 February 2020,"The 1996 Summer Olympics took place in Atlanta, and one of the accompanying attractions were free outdoor concerts in a park there sponsored by AT&T. This film even shows the title character (Paul Walter Hauser) and his mother Bobi (Kathy Bates, nominated for the Best Supporting Actress Oscar) attending a Kenny Rogers concert there. The next night he discovers a bomb hidden in a back pack while working as a security guard. (He had almost called in sick that day because of intestinal trouble.) Because of his diligence, an evacuation begins before the bomb goes off and the casualties are limited to two dead and 111 wounded. Jewell quickly becomes the prime suspect, and his life is made a living hell by the FBI, as portrayed by Jon Hamm and Ian Gomez, and the media, as portrayed by Olivia Wilde. According to the FBI, he fit the profile of a person who plants bombs in public places. First, he lives with his mother, although he was over the age of thirty, and plays shooter video games. Second, he is an overweight wannabee cop with a not-so-secret ambition of becoming a hero and is knowledgeable about explosives. He even reads police manuals in his spare time and shoots at an expert level. A scene early in the film shows him to have been an overzealous college campus police officer for which he gets fired. Third, he is a gun nut, and his collection even includes a grenade with the explosive material removed. What struck me about him is that he would not seem out of place at a science fiction convention, and he is the kind of person who would talk your ear off about his enthusiasms if you let him. One of his weaknesses is that he has so much respect for and confidence in law enforcement officers that he cooperates too much with their investigation. Fortunately, Jewell had made friends with an attorney (Sam Rockwell) years previously, who comes to his rescue, and his name is eventually cleared, especially after the real bomber is caught six years later. Unfortunately, Jewell himself died of natural causes only a few years afterwards. This is a true story and is very disturbing, because it shows the power of law enforcement and media to ruin an innocent person's life. The bombing scene was even filmed in Atlanta's Centennial Park, where the actual bombing took place.
One of the controversies over the film is that it shows Wilde's character, Kathy Scruggs, having sex with Hamm's, a fictional character, to obtain information. Scruggs was a real person who died from a prescription medication overdose in 2001, and she is unable to defend herself. Her practice in the film of trading sex for information is pure speculation on the part of the filmmakers, director Clint Eastwood and writer Billy Ray, and is disputed by Scruggs's friends. Her paper, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, did win Jewell's defamation lawsuit against them (other media companies settled out of court), but does not come off well. Reportedly they are considering a lawsuit of their own against the filmmakers.",Richard Jewell
270,jmrecillas-83435,The true of Eastwood's Late Style: dissapointment,2,7 June 2020,"I guess we can say that since mr. Eastwood develope thta that we can name as his Late Style his cinematography went to a lousy state of affairs. He hasn't make a decent film since his lousy ""J. Edgar"" (2011), but sice his ""Invictus"" (2009) you can perceive that something went wrong with him. J. Edgar is a film made about disguise all the abuses and crimes commited by mr. J. Edgar Hoover. A poor film about a poor and despicable man, that doesn't deserve other thing than perpetual oblivion.How can it be ""Richard Jewell"" a good film if its build upon the same basis that ""J. Edgar""? Mr. Eastwood build a film about lie after lie, presenting a b&w perspective, like a fairy tale, from a very complicate theme about a very complicated research on a such issue as homeland terrorism and present all the characters as perfectly good or perfectly bad?Faced with the very facts of the terrorist attack on the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, Eastwood's film presents us with a fantastic world, divided into the individual voluntarism that pretends to want everything, and the legal, factual, complex world where the events occur. The complexity of the real world disappears not only from the characters but from the story. Eastwood takes the liberty of lying, literally, by introducing agent Tom Shaw (John Hamm) as a ruthless FBI agent hell-bent on locking up Richard Jewell and who until the end still considers him a suspect, which is true, but not It was not for Agent Shaw, but for the director of the FBI, who never wanted to clear Jewell's name or exonerate him post-mortem. Eastwood also lies and deforms the character of reporter Kathy Scruggs (Olivia Wilde) by hiding her dependence on drugs and presenting her at the Jewell press conference at the Marriott Hotel almost on the verge of tears, as if she repented and gave herself up. He realizes that he was wrong in his case, as Eastwood actually claims. And that is false, both the reporter Scruggs and the newspaper she worked for never retracted their false reports. Not only that, Scruggs dies of a heroin overdose in the days leading up to the trial of the terrorist behind the Olympics bombing.What we can call Mr. Eastwood's Late Style is riddled with a very simple and fanciful morality, unrelated to reality, which has permeated his last nine films. That moral perspective of Mr. Eastwood was not remotely in his films of the previous decade, where he gave us at least three masterpieces. This late stage of his development as a film director has given us discursive and argumentative films, instead of presenting us with solidly constructed characters, which date back to their own nature and the complex reality of the world in which they move.It is a sad swan song for a once great, great director. What a pity.",Richard Jewell
271,aigoalies,So many holes in this movie,5,16 July 2020,"I scrolled for two pages straight on IMDB and I didn't see a single review under 7 of this movie, so I'm going to give it a shot. First off, the movie starts off very interesting with an interesting concept of a hero being portrayed as a villain. The movie soon turns into an emotional mess with tons of overly emotional scenes including crying at every single minute from Richard and his mom. On top of this the story starts to push hard the narrative that the media is terrible and the FBI are pigs. The funniest part is, even though the media obviously didn't give him a fair chance, they won a defamation lawsuit that he had against them.
The other problem I had with this movie is the fact that the FBI was apparently unjustifyingly suspecting him. The part where the FBI tries to manipulate him into signing an arrest form is obviously not good, however, the rest of the investigation is totally justified, the movie even states it. He evaded taxes, owned firearms, knew a lot about bombs, owned hollow grenade shells, had posed as an officer, has made questionable arrests. I would have been surprised if he wasn't investigated. This obviously does not excuse the narrative that surrounded him and obviously that is terrible.
The character arc of Kathy is also handled terribly. She turns from a cutthroat investigator to a soft and caring person at the flip of a dime. They also slandered her as a person, basically insinuating she slept her way to the top, and showing that she slept to get information and also portraying her as a psycopath who cares about the story more than lives (for the first half at least). Funny thing is none of those things can be proven true about her. So a film portraying the media as terrible people who slander innocent people, basically slandered someone who can't defend herself because she's dead. I have more points but I'll leave it at that, something to hopefully think about.",Richard Jewell

He recreated Jewell's mind, temperament, life. Showed that genius and decency does not necessarily come in a slick package. Hauser/Jewell was eminently likable and still drew sympathy. Visually he was not an imposing man, not your usual hero. His alleged personality traits came to be treasured. As his character was developed and exposed, we came to believe in him, trust him. willing to follow him. The lib Hollywood will never give this actor the recognition he deserves--it's up to the viewers.Every performance was terrific. I loved hating Kathy Scruggs (by Olivia Wilde). I detested her, despised her. I hoped she would get hers and that I could be there when it happened. It was claimed she never got over the event (see the movie). What is known is she never redeemed herself for her role in the terrible persecution of Jewell. Some say she never got over it--that's on her. She died 5 years later of drug(s) overdose. It was undetermined if it was suicide or accidental. Olivia Wilde certainly deserves kudos for her performance.As for the attorney Watson Byrant (Lucian Lincoln ""Lin"" Wood Jr. in real life) played by Sam Rockwell--he made me cringe. Scary guy. But he was not distracted by red herrings. He checked facts then went full throated defender of Jewell. No mercy. I soon wanted to hire this guy--I just need the cause to justify it.If you love this issue, or if you love excellent and nuanced performances--or both--you will enjoy this movie.

The FBI did not have any evidence against Jewell. None. Judgement.Richard Jewell was not slim and muscular. Not movie star material looks. He was short and stout. He was handsome to his mother but not everyone else. He was slow spoken and eager to be accepted, especially by law enforcement. Not violent. Not angry. Very observant. A caring individual. Honest.

279,jdowney-57-371157,A Work of Art by a Master Craftsman,8,21 March 2020,"Clint Eastwood has a style...anti-style. He sets up his camera, tells his actors what to say and they say it. He's been doing this for sometime now, and for this simple movie, it works really well.I've seen some criticisms in other reviews that the movie is propaganda or bias. But that ignores the blatant fact here. In this case, it happened the way it is told. Everyone was just doing their job. The FBI employed a profiler who saw a scenario. The agents bought in and pursued Jewell. His name was leaked to the reporter, who reported it. The facts are she was romantically involved with a police officer, not with an FBI agent. But, was she aggressively trying to get a scoop? Ya. Was the FBI wrong? Ya. Did someone leak Jewell's name to her? Ya.And in the end, she figured out he didn't do it and she got that she had done the man wrong. So, although there is license in modifying the narrative to simply connect her scoop to the FBI agent through a romantic quid pro quo, the movie doesn't really propagandize anything.The movie does not shy away from Richard Jewell's flaws. He is presented as a fat overzealous police wannabe who is a little slow witted and potentially dangerous in his abuse of his authority.The acting here is great top to bottom. John Hamm play the part he seems destined for...the FBI agent. Ditto Kathy Bates as momma. Olivia Wilde nails it, portraying Kathy Scruggs as an ambitious will do anything for a story, hard drinking hard living old school reporter, with dreams of a TV career. In the end, she stands in the back in tears realizing what she had unleashed on some poor sap. PW Hauser plays Richard Jewell as a very believable version of a mall cop borderline halfwit who dreams of being a law enforcement officer. What he does is unbelievably difficult and nuanced. Sam Rockwell tones it down and delivers a great performance as his lawyer.And that is really the core of this story. One guy believes in the other guy, and he stands by him against the media and the FBI, who intractably can not back down, but Humpty Dumpty can not ever be made whole again.In the end, only the FBI agent is unchanged. Every other character in this story is affected and changed by the narrative. That is story telling, done simply and gracefully by Mr. Eastwood.",Richard Jewell

These people are more interested in projecting their political agendas onto the film, rather than exploring it's actual themes.Like the actual Richard Jewell, this movie fits a profile. On it's surface, the film must be conservative. It has a sympathetic southern white man that loves guns and wants to be a cop. A female reporter that is depicted in an unsavory way. Oh, and the films director is cranky old Clint Eastwood.However, the film is actually much more complex. It's about the relationship between a mother and her son. It's about ordinary people thrown into extraordinary circumstances. It's about the foolish nature of those who blindly follow authority.

This is how movies should be made and structured, simply put. When moviegoers and movie renters pay to see a movie, they are looking for a real movie, a rewarding experience, and ""Richard Jewell"" absolutely delivers this experience.Eastwood did a masterful job in creating and telling this unbelievable true story. He edited it down to almost exactly 2 hours, with a definitive beginning, middle, and end that is not only easy to follow and become absorbed in, but also lives up to the standards of how true classic movies were always made.Look, I liked OUTIH and The Irishman, I really did, but I would be lying if I said that neither of them were poorly edited, far too long, and had major flaws. Richard Jewell, on the other hand, takes us all back to a moment in time when movies were just well constructed into movies.But it doesn't only adhere to the movie structure which we all love, it also delivers award-worthy acting performances by lead actor Hauser, supporting actress Bates, and supporting actor for the lawyer. It should also be nominated for directing and editing. This is just a truly solid, well-made movie.If you were a skeptic like I was before seeing it, rest assured you are going to be surprised at what could arguably be the Best Picture of 2019.10/10",Richard Jewell

Paul Richard Hauser, Sam Rockwell and Kathy Bates merit strong Oscar consideration and Olivia Wilde and John Hamm provide solid support. The film is commendably straightforward, it wastes no time, it doesn't grandstand and provides believable people and authentic dialog which are all too rare in current film.

304,lf_macias,Less in the beginning and more at the end would do a more emotional film,7,5 January 2020,"The most recent film directed by Clint Eastwood, again based on a true story, surprises first with the narrative skill that the man has a director at 89 years old. He is a very skilled narrator whose films are usually entertaining, engaging and emotional. It also stands out for the great staging that involves the recreation of a stage in which the 1996 Atlanta Olympics were held; the crowd scenes, the newspaper office, Richard's mom's apartment ... Everything is well set and credible. I also highlight all the performances, each character is well delineated.
The problem for me is that the conclusion of the story occurs prematurely and I feel that the arches of the secondary characters do not close: the FBI agent, the reporter and the lawyer. That subtracted emotion from the impact of the story. I also felt that the film takes a while to start with its main conflict. It could have spent less time at the beginning and more at the end.
However, it is a product worth checking out at this beginning of the year.",Richard Jewell
305,tandc-53810,Mesmerizing. Inciteful. Shocking.,10,18 December 2019,"The acting in Clint's latest effort is astounding.He has gathered the best actors he could find (Bates, Rockwell, Hamm) and slam-dunked his movie with a tour d'force by Hauser, a relatively unknown fellow who channels poor Richard Jewell.This drama is a sobering reminder that government power (like the media) can destroy.What I found to be the greatest takeaway was this- that ""profiling"" suspects can be terribly misleading and destructive, a punch in the gut.Rockwell is the friend and advocate who tears down the government facade. Bates has never been better as the faithful mom. And Hamm is -- well, Don Draper has joined the FBI!See this movie-you win't take your eyes off the screen.Like I said in the header: MESMERIZING! I would give this movie 11 stars but alas they only gave me 10.Eastwood has a home run hit here, but I doubt folks will pay the big bucks to see this without a lot of CG or a light saber somewhere. Clint has beautifully honored a very decent Richard Jewell.That Jewell managed to endure and rise above the shame is itself a tribute to this true American hero.",Richard Jewell
306,Billybobble1,A beautiful gem,9,12 March 2020,"I like to go into film and movies in the dark, all I knew was this had a stellar cast, it was about a wrongful accusation of the Atlanta bombing and a very respectable rating on IMDB.Three quarters through I knew I would review so browsed IMDB in readiness, and then I saw Clint Eastwood was the director, 'of course' I said to myself. This is a touching and powerful story and presented as only a masterful filmmaker could. I would say I am not a huge Clint fan but his expertise is very obvious, I was feeling exactly how I believe he wanted me to feel throughout the film, without feeling this was through use of tropes, though they were there.I am a huge fan of Sam Rockwell and yet again he delivers an amazing performance but it has to be said the true star is Paul Walter Hauser. I like to review without spoilers and I will keep to this, suffice to say having only a very brief knowledge of the real person he portrayed he seems almost indistinguishable.This film is a fantastic example of where I like to differentiate between film and movie, this is very much a film, and of the highest caliber, genuine emotions and thoughts felt throughout. This is why I don't do spoilers, watch it and feel your own feelings without pre-judgement, just know if you love film you will very much appreciate this story and it's production. The other cast members are also excellent in their performance, it's probably reasonably well known, but the man Eastwood is an auteur and really gets the most of his actors, as proven here.I must admit, the loose information I had going in I thought I may enjoy it and probably only watch once. I enjoyed it much more than I thought, I may still only ever watch once but it will stick with me for a very long time and I feel wiser from the experience, that's film. My hats off to all involved in the production.It would be great to explore details, but again, I stick to spoiler free reviews, so do yourself a favour and give this a watch, there's definitely some conversation to be had amongst friends, colleagues and family over this.",Richard Jewell

He has a knack for picking stories and making movies that pull you in and keep you engrossed without having to rely on massive budgets, special effects/CGI. He understands that a quality movie is one that leads the audience on an emotional journey by getting them to relate to the characters and the situations they find themselves in. This movie is a fine example and the casting and acting was very good. I can't understand why Paul Walter Hauser didn't get as much recognition as he deserved when it came to nominations and awards.

I would like to think that this movie is a vindication for Richard Jewell, but the film did not completely convince me of his innocence. Probably should have presented the evidence better of how Jewell could not have made the call and returned to the scene before the bomb went off.

There is so much to feel from this film thanks to Jon Hamm, Olivia Wilde and Sam Rockwell ... Kathy Bates!Wilde, Hamm and Bates have great roles so bring to life engaging characters. The three are a 'ten' in this film. Sam Rockwell - who offered an indelible character in Seven Psychos - avoided the quirky characteristics movie-goers have come to love. The consequence was there was just a little life missing from his role but he still helps make this a memorable film.The lead is played by PW Hauser and since I did not see I Tonya, he is new to the screen to me. By the time the film concludes, you value his performance. He really has the sound of what I recall of Richard Jewell's voice. But he is not screen gold and he is often filmed in half-lit interior scenes that exude 'dull'. That is intentional, since Client want to present the ordinary honest of the simple American Richard Jewell. Still it takes time to start to appreciate the character PW Hauser carries. I came away thinking Nick Offerman missed the role of a lifetime.Strong film. Very memorable. You appreciate the will of people to avoid getting crushed by the man.",Richard Jewell
312,pthef,From Zero to Hero to Zero Again,9,30 December 2019,"As he's always done, Clint Eastwood delivers a brilliant depiction of the actual tragic events as the FBI and the press conspired to wreck the life of an American hero. I understand the Atlanta Journal Constitution objected vociferously to the depiction of the head of their lynch mob, Kathy Scruggs, prostituting herself to the FBI (hereafter feebs) to get their pack of lies regarding Mr. Jewell. But who seriously believes she got that information on her feet rather than on her back?To me, the movie was a good illustration of a phenomenon we've seen time after time before and since these tragic events, the press exercising its First Amendment rights while accepting nor exercising one whit of responsibility in their pursuit. And a good illustration of a too-powerful and corrupted FBI that needs a far tighter leash before using its power to destroy an innocent man.BRAVO, Clint Eastwood!",Richard Jewell

315,jrwollscheid,Criminally underrated biopic,8,31 August 2020,"Despite Clint Eastwood's high age, he is still able to churn out masterful cinema as this film shows. The film centers in the 1996 Centennial Park Bombing and the man who discovered the bomb and saved thousands, Richard Jewell. Paul Walter Hauser shines in the role as the slightly mentally handicapped security guard, Richard Jewell. Kathy Bates speech late in the movie drives audiences to tears and makes you truly feel sadness. The dark lighting and apartment where the movie takes place makes you truly feel sorry for Richard. The darkness is used primarily where the FBI or cops are in the scene as they mistreat Richard. Before walking into the film with my dad, I asked him about the actual bombing and he told me how he thought Richard Jewell was the bomber before he saw the trailer as the media spun it as him being the bomber in the late '90s. The film focuses on media attention and how it can cast those as heroes and villains and can ruin a persons life in unimaginable ways.",Richard Jewell
316,priyadarshanmaity98,Another Clint Eastwood classic and a american classic,8,18 January 2020,"Richard jewel- Clint Eastwood's timely based biopic of American hero Richard jewell is heartbreaking and a powerful watch. Ok this is nothing new for audiences who is expecting something different from sir Clint Eastwood but with so much dignity he potrayed a real life hero is stunning at it's own right. The film starts with some very predictable scenario building up characters, potraying a negative character frankly which is the only thing I thought was not up to the mark but when the Atlanta Olympics starts the palpable tension rises and the real story started to form with ferocious pacing. Sam Rockwell is rocking in his potrayal of a ballsy lawyer and Kathy Bates gives one of her best performance to date watch out for the speech I bet you will feel teary eyed. The only questionable thing about the movie is Olivia Wilde who is chewing the scenes like a villain from a b grade fantasy movie and researching about the story I came to know some part of her story is fictionalized so that was a jarring decision for Clint Eastwood. And the real star Paul Walter Hauser is so deeply affecting in his potrayal of the titular character that your heart goes out for him very much Oscar worthy. The message is clear how media can tarnish one's faith about law enforcement or any other thing within seconds just to earn some extra amount of respect and money. Honest and honourable men get punished because of this things. This is one of the most timely message the films gives regarding the unnecessary cultural bias against movies or show which are showing real life issues but making those creative medium into dangerous fake propaganda is really distressing but this movie should be viewed it is essential highly recommended",Richard Jewell

It explores how a man who saved dozens of lives in the Centennial Park Bombing, is being framed as the person behind the bombing. Throughout the film, I felt sympathy towards the character and realized how it reflects to our media in the present times. Richard Jewell is one of those films that brings the past into the future. It allows you to see how small an information is leaked can become a wide attention for the media to come up with different versions of the story without looking the other side of it.",Richard Jewell

Jon Hamm does a good job as basically a villain, even though the character he played does not exist in real life. Many people in the media are upset that Olivia Wilde's character, reporter Kathy Scruggs, is shown as possibly having slept with the FBI Agent Shaw (Hamm)- I thought, judging by the reaction of the media in defending one of their own, that there was an actual sex scene and there is not. I found it funny that the media got so upset about the hint of improper behavior, yet none of the media outlets that crucified Jewell ever apologized to him. The movie does a very good job of telling the story, and it's not all one-sided, it shows why law enforcement would start to suspect Jewell and why his propensity to be so deferential to law enforcement actually hurt his case. It is hard to watch this movie and not feel terrible for a young man who saved a lot of people and should have been treated like the hero he was.

The media has to be held accountable for the power they wield, as much as any government, law enforcement agency, activist group, etc. Apparently, ""innocent until guilty"" means very little when social justice can strip someone of their life worse than jail can.Anyways, rant over!

The acting is superb, despite the fact that I think the journalist was a bit too over the top. However, I do have a problem with the movie, and that is the fact that it's last act ends quite abruptly. The journalist, who was one of the main characters in the movie, just disappears and we know nothing of what happened to her. Also, why the strange fixation on Jewell by the FBI Agent, despite him being exonerated. Which then begs the question, what happened to that FBI Agent? Also, nothing was mentioned of the lawsuits that followed and compensation that Jewell received for the hell he was put through. I would have liked to know all this, perhaps even with a little blurb at the end.

I lived in Atlanta at the time and did for an instant think Jewell could have done it, emphasize could. But I was also an avid newspaper junkie and as such suspected an AJC agenda even more so. The paper has always tended to prejudice themselves with their not so subtle anti white narratives as purveyor of civil rights ad nauseum, which they spoonfeed to the local population almost daily. And this is the saddest thing. Jewel, and even Scruggs, are long gone but their legacy has had little impact on the news outlet that helped to originate the lie that ruined lives, at least temporarily. What should be most concerning is that the papers motive wasn't commercial (the paper probably hasn't made money in years) but an exercise in power to destroy people they just don't like. Eastwood told the story with vivid filmmaking at its best and Paul Walter Hauser should get best actor for a role that he played to perfection as nobody else could.Filmmaking is at its best when a movie is not only well made but ripe for the times.

That is the one thing the press will never forgive you for ( ie criticizing THEM). Actually the movie does no such thing--it strongly implies that Wilde's journalist is ALREADY screwing around with John Hamm's FBI man. The movie itself is so well acted and realized and shot by the director that you feel that the 89 year Eastwood can do anything. He directs with supreme confidence.

All of the characters were excellent, from the always outstanding Kathy Bates (whose press conference almost had me in tears), even to the reporter to set Jewell's trial-by-media in motion.Paul Walter Hauser's Jewell did make me think of Barney Fife a little bit in his zealousness, but this guy was no dummie. In the end, in spite of his flaws, he proved to be what a law man should be.Sam Rockwell as Jewell's attorney was enjoyable too. I loved how he and Jewell made their acquaintance in the opening scene.

350,sallykeller-51142,Bubba The Bomber,9,3 October 2020,"...Is what it said on FRONT PAGES above the fold when a government agency and the media class decided to bring a man's life to a screeching halt. It's bad enough that the ambitious 4th Estate who are hell bent on gaining readership forget about their training to serve the public interest. Instead a mans physical appearance was thrown into a tagline...forget about the need to defend himself from mass murder and terrorism for a second.The performance of Kathy Bates as a distraught mother sent chills through the screen, there were otherwise not compelling characters or fancy story arcs, what we have here is the brilliance of well plotted true to life story of injustice and the people that have to face it when those dripping with ambition make fatal errors.I didn't plan on writing a review until I discovered a litany of Hollywood types screaming feminist slogans and completely overlooking the victim: Richard Jewell.The facts are that government and their executive bodies have checks and balances on them, where we fail as a society most often is that the gate keepers of information don't have even close to the same scrutiny on them and often make mistakes that change the course of peoples lives forever.The essence of this story is real - the vantage point it is told from is also meritable and true in the face of a culture and industry that doesn't like being told what to do. It's no wonder that trust for journalism is at an all time low and publications are making less money than ever before. The democratisation of the news is something we can all be thankful for 20yrs after this event.Clint Eastwood in my opinion is the most underrated story teller in the business that continues to make films that capture people's hearty. More importantly he is choosing the right stories to tell and people are paying attention.The controversy appears to be around the use of real names and the portrayal of Scruggs as basically swapping sexual favours for story. For those that have pulled up the sordid anecdotes throughout her life and career by family and friends - there is no doubt that she was no angel and made a terrible mistake. Those trying to defend her are political activists and her media colleagues that conduct themselves like war veterans within their own fraternity. The movie does not suggest an explicit quid pro quo but an existing arrangement that looked like it was well in place before the inciting incident. All this still doesn't discount any positive contributions she may have made to journalism but that is not what this production was about and all that expect otherwise are maliciously self indulgent.The opposite actually is written into the script, perhaps something that Scruggs didn't deserve, she is shown as somewhat repentant by the end of the movie and someone able to empathise were her part in the tragedy of a wrongful accusation.If Richard Jewell was as meek and mild mannered as this rendition then he was taken from this life far too soon at the age of 44 even so, his dream of being a registered police officer again was fulfilled and this was most satisfying to see.Sometimes studios don't need strange twists and dynamic plots to produce an excellent story, one that needs to be told will make room for itself.",Richard Jewell
351,Johntrek187,God damn hero.,9,24 March 2021,"Oh man, what a great film. First and for most, Richard Jewell is a hero. Bottom line. Same with his defense team. Same team that defended the kid in the Maga hat, who like Richard was also falsely accused and had his name dragged through the mud by the media. Sam Rockwell, who steals the show, who plays a real life character, but was part of a team in real life. But bsck to the film. Jewell is falsely accused. The first agent should of been sued. Same with the paper. He is a bumbling man, and rather foolish, but he is a hero. This film is in depth, really takes ya back to 1996. Clint Eastwood is a masterful storyteller and he is here as well. Just see this film. You'll love it...",Richard Jewell

I swore that after seeing the movie The Muse, that I would never trust another Clint Eastwood movie again, but here I am in quarantine and decided to give it a try, and boy did Clint redeem himself with this one.
Thank you Richard Jewell for saving so many people's lives that day, and may you RIP.
And to the haters of this film, nice try but we all know you loved it.",Richard Jewell
353,ewanfortune,More Than Just Strong Performances,9,3 February 2020,"This movie is a piercing commentary on the US government and the media. It highlights the problems with both and can be summed up in just 3 words; ""F the payphone."" Whether journalist or FBI Agent, the truth doesn't matter a lot of the time. It's about the story or the arrest. However, we are shown here how that impacts someone and the people close to them.Paul Walter Hauser is excellent as Richard Jewell, a man that respects authority and genuinely just wants to do the right thing. His life is flipped upside down however when, after saving lives by reporting a suspicious package that turns out to be a bomb, he becomes the prime suspect in the case. As well as messing his life up, this also has an effect on his mother who is portrayed brilliantly by Kathy Bates. The plot never drags, the film maintaining a quick pace throughout its 2 hours+ runtime as Richard fights to clear his name. The dangers of the media are on display in its full glory here and you are rooting for Richard to win.The cast is round out with some more great actors such as Sam Rockwell, Olivia Wilde and Jon Hamm (who's a smooth as always). Clint Eastwood's direction is as fresh as ever, doubly impressive for a man in his 90s, and his unmistakable style is present throughout too. The script is also very good, with the appropriate amount of humour and tragedy. Richard Jewell was a man whose story deserved to be told, and it has been given justice here.",Richard Jewell
354,BenHur59,Clint was not wrong or unfair to anyone,10,4 January 2020,"This is one of the most powerful films I have ever seen. The performances by Hauser and Rockwell are as good as any you are likely to see. And Clint tells the story directly and simply. But because of the Scruggs issue, Golden Globes has already snubbed this film, and the oscars may do so as well.As for Scruggs, when the brouhaha first started up about this portrayal, before it got really intense, I did a lot of searching on this person, her life and her death, and I found sources that were people who worked with her at the newspaper. Their comments tend to corroborate the behaviors you see in this film. While no one that I read claimed that she slept with an FBI agent, there were people who said she ""dated"" police officers in Atlanta in order to stay close to breaking police beat news stories. She was a smoking, boozing, loud, vulgar and obnoxious broad whose ambition was to get the big scoop.Now there are also people saying that, now being dead, she cannot defend herself. However, she lived a few years after the Jewell debacle was over, and she had plenty of time to defend herself. All she did was keep saying that she reported the facts. One source lists her cause of death as an opiod overdose; whether accidental or deliberate is unknown.Don't let this issue keep you from seeing this great film.",Richard Jewell
355,MOVIE-REVIEW-POOPSHOOTs,Hauser is phenomenal - and he is innocent,8,5 March 2020,"Another great Clint Eastwood flick. And a great piece of history that has, unfortunately, been left out of the history books. Probably that it serves as a reminder that the government and any federal law enforcement agency, despite how much they flex their muscle, are made up of people like the rest of us. And people can be cunning, self-righteous, cruel, ruthless and make mistakes without even committing a crime. Who knows how many years this investigation took off of Richard Jewell's short yet very interesting life. But this film is the important part of history that has been forgotten, and a reminder that you cannot give time back to somebody, even if you were the one that took it away from them.",Richard Jewell
356,onebit,Very simplified script...,6,6 March 2020,"The main actor's play is wonderful, it can give him an Oscar (Alas!), but the film itself is very one-sided and quickly hides, leads into the shadows, the bosses of all the ""villains"" in the picture, channeling the anger of the crowd on the grassroots figures, but it never happens in life. Some scenes are too emotional, where it was not necessary to spend time on them, but to expose the power. But the director did not go for it. For the 90s this is a good movie, but not for the 3rd decade of the 21st century..I still recommend viewing it, Hauser's game is outstanding, as is the direction, the atmosphere. But the scenario is frankly weak.",Richard Jewell
357,dante_12,Another great Eastwood touch!,8,25 April 2021,An impressive film with top acting. I could really feel with Richard during the movie. A slow paced special good film again from Clint Eastwood.A man attacked by the power of media and the grip from FBI. This is so important these times with all the media channels in our life.My emotions where on board with Jewel train and at the same time I got upset with the one eye thinking from the investigators. And more important how powerful a presumption from media can be and lead people in the society to a wrong conclusion.,Richard Jewell

359,larrybud2004,Every bit deserved,10,12 February 2020,"The media love their drive by reporting and after they beat you up they move onto the next story. Like a bull in a china shop.Eastwood does a terrific job bringing the events of Atlanta to the forefront, and the aftermath of an innocent and a literal hero to the big screen. He shows the FBI and media for what they are and continue to be.You also have to put these timelines into historical context. The US Federal agencies were on bad run in the 90s. The Waco siege happened only 3 years earlier, and the FBI murdered Randy Weaver's wife and kid a year before that. This is just in another long line of abuses of power.Combine that with the crap media, and we have Richard Jewell.The pacing on the move is excellent, and the entire cast is spot on. Rare to see a movie come out of Hollywood like this one, and Eastwood is one of the few who could pull it off.We never got to know the real Richard Jewell, and he died in 07 at age of 44. Would love to see a documentary on the rest of his life.",Richard Jewell
360,DOGSLEDDER54,A serious subject handled with deft humor,8,14 December 2019,"Richard Jewell is a great story, a tragedy that needed to be told. It is a shameful episode of both media hysteria and the excesses of inept law enforcement and abuse of an accused citizen. In this story, the media is shown rushing to judgement and convicting an innocent person in the press and on TV, a person who is ignorant of the power of the press, and the power that the FBI has to crush persons who are accused or suspected of crimes. The FBI repeatedly ignores the rights of the accused and tries to trick Jewell into confessing without meaning to, with blatant disregard for both ethics and the law itself. The corrosion that was so pervasive in 1996 is still there- and has grown to immense proportions.
The other element to this story, the lack of care taken by the news media is also relevant today. In this story the reporter who wrote the story naming Jewell as the main suspect eventually discovered the truth and attempted to correct the error as best she could unlike today- the media are dangerously taking sides on political issues rather than reporting or doing the job of a journalist. This is destroying trust of the media as surely as the politicization of the FBI and Justice Department will destroy the faith in the Federal government itself. Mr. Eastwood's film is sounding an alarm. Will anyone listen ?",Richard Jewell
361,diazaraceli,Excellent movie!,10,20 December 2019,"It is a bittersweet movie that will make you laugh and cry, all at the same time. The sad thing is that it is based on a true story. Poor guy! He was a hero, and did not deserve to be treated so badly.",Richard Jewell

After watching this and the manhunt series its very clear that Eastwood looks for an easy directorial project while also disregarding the impact it has on those who watch and those who seek answers. Not only is this a thinly scrutinized view of the fact that happened, it also shows the garbage tactitics they use to obtaine their ""evidence."" I just hope that those who ""wrote"" this are flipping burgers so we dont have to suffer through anything like this again.",Richard Jewell

Well-acted, well-edited, and well-directed to convey the utter frustration felt by the victim of this media/government witch hunt. The only unfortunate part is that the film did not come out sooner, before Mr. Jewell and Kathy Scruggs passed away. Everyone should see this film, if nothing else, to send a message to Hollywood that we all want to see more films of this quality and subject matter.",Richard Jewell
370,francobulgheoz,Thrillingly underrated.,9,16 January 2020,"Let me begin with stating, how the hell did'nt this make it to Best Picture? How the hell did'nt P.W. Hauser nor Rockwell get a nomination for their work?Richard Jewell is a true amazing story of the reality and sadness of the american system in relation to crimes. There is always an immediate search for someone to blame after a crime happens.Performances drive the film. Paul Walter Hauser did an astonishing work, having into account both his resemblance to the real Jewell and his amazing acting skills which yet remain unkown to many. Sam Rockwell is one of the best actors working these days, and he should've gotten his 3rd nomination in a row for Best Supporting Actor. Kathy Bates did incredible, she was true and relatable. Others such as Jon Hamm and Olivia Wilde properly fulfilled the picture's ensemble as well.Clint Eastwood is simply amazing. Being in the industry for over 70 years and still managing to impress. The plot is handled with intensity, and thrilling scenes are to remain in my memory. Though he did a great work, some particular blocking and editing disconnected me for brief moments. Nevertheless, he handled a properly written script and brought a thought provoking story to life with the great aid of the casting chosen.This film is captivating and gripping from the first scenes already, and it manages to keep you hooked and rooting for the good guys from the moment of the incident.It's sad to remember this as a true story because it definitively shows how flawed the society we live in is.Nevertheless, it works greatly as a cinematic piece and I would love to see it again.",Richard Jewell

You will not be disappointed if you go see this film at the cinema. The cast is outstanding. My personal favourite Sam Rockwell shines as always but the fantastic Paul Walter Hauser and amazing Kathy Bates are incredible. I gave this 10/10 because it is simply that good.",Richard Jewell
373,marlon_jackson,Performance driven gem,7,25 December 2019,"Imagine being Paul Walter Hauser playing lead over Kathy Bates and Sam Rockwell. Not to mention Jon Hamm.
This kid gave the performance of a lifetime!
The bomb blast happens early on so most of the screen time is spent on the breaking news story giving way to the FBI probe, but the pacing was close to perfect. I never felt like the movie was going on too long.
On the downside, I was almost cussing the Richard Jewell character unwittingly doing everything possible to make it seem like it really was him. But I think that was intended.
Kathy Bates doing Barbara Jewell's news conference defending her son was very moving. What a monologue! That and Hauser finally coming to life at the FBI headquarters was worth the price of admission by themselves.
I recommend this movie.",Richard Jewell

The 24 hour cable news networks have been a blessing and a curse. Back in the ""olden days"", news was about 24 minutes which included international, national, local, sports, weather, and cat bites dog stories. Now the news is in the business of reporting what will give them the highest rating instead of primary purpose: keep a free people informed. I thoroughly enjoyed every minute of this story.

376,mw_carlson,Very good movie. Perhaps needed.,8,4 April 2020,"The acting was top notch and the story was quite interesting. Let's face it, it's also well timed in this day and age when every Hollywood film is much more infatuated with 'meh, diversity' than making good content. As good story telling and quality acting from believable characters has given way to the dumbing down and generally constant assault on our collective intelligence; all of course, sold with the subtlety of an atomic bomb. This film rises above that nonsense and it's like a therapeutic breath of fresh air. It manages to avoid the usual mindless Hollywood elitist pseudo-religious commandments that play on and on like an endless, soulless drum. Instead they just manage to tell a good story with good acting and dispensed with the dogmatic, overtly preachy and diversity for diversity's sake check boxes. Noticeably missing are the sprinkled in useless so-called 'marginalized' token characters whose mission never surprises and never waivers; to virtue signal their way through the hordes of evil commoners and smash glass ceilings and patriarchies and exile anyone that dares to resist the Borg. And it does all of that while not being unnecessarily complex while simultaneously remaining interesting.
Clint Eastwood manages to make another winning film while not sacrificing a stitch to the cliche alter of wokeness and for that reason alone this jewel in the rough deserves a five star minimum and I added another well deserved three stars for the quality and entertainment value.",Richard Jewell

387,joates-57648,Shows The Power Of The Mainstream Media,9,4 March 2020,"True Journalism died a long long time ago. Since the beginning of the 24 hour news cycle, the quality and integrity of journalists has fallen off a cliff. Now the ONLY priority is to be the FIRST to run a story. They don't care about checking facts of the case. They don't care about checking their sources. They don't care about verifying their sources information with a third party. All the care about is being first to run the story. It's become nothing more then a profit business based on internet clicks and show ratings. It's no longer about the new and true journalism. This movie shows us a time period where journalists were shifting their mentalities. A look to the future where fellow citizens don't matter, where facts don't matter and where errors in reporting don't matter as they'll just drop a short ""editors note"" buried in the story that most people won't read. These journalists ruined a mans life and that sad thing is, he definitely hasn't been the last person who was perfectly innocent (and actually saved lives) that the mainstream media has ruined. The bad part about it, people get laughed at if they say they don't believe the news these days. If they call them fake news. They get called conspiracy theorists for not blindly following the mainstream media, when in reality, we should all be laughing at the people who do believe the mainstream media without doing their own fact checking and verifying sources. A free press is a great thing for our way of life but the press that we've been dealt over the last 30 years has been anything but great and in current times, the vast majority of them are not free. They're owned by powerful people who only hire similar minds and they use their platform to promote their own ideology and beliefs to millions of people while denigrating the thoughts, beliefs and supporters of different politics or ideology. That is one of the most powerful tools in the world. So how ""Free"" is our press in today's times?This movie does a fantastic job pointing out a lot of the issues I mentioned above.

Not the best piece of modern cinema ever made by any means, but a damn good film. I remember the Atlanta Olympics pretty well, and I'd completely forgotten about the bombing. Mostly because it was of little consequence in terms of domestic terrorism carnage. Having said that is why this film is really good. It's a character study of a dopey, easy mark and also shines a light on our culture of ""guilty until proven innocent"". Whereas, nowadays the media and the government get ahold of something. They work together to frame a narrative for the public. Then they drive that narrative down their throats. Even if the pieces don't fit. Especially if the pieces don't fit.

407,Wbsmith,Building interest,8,31 October 2020,"At first I thought this was slow, awkward and quite frankly poorly directed, but the interest increased as events unfolded. Engaging performance by Sam Rockwell as usual but Nadia nearly stole the show, Kathy Bates managed to impress, a bit of a sideshow from Olivia Wilde and Jon Hamm, but ultimately it really was Paul Walter Hauser's film as he earned our trust, sympathy and eventually admiration. A lasting impression. Well worth a viewing.",Richard Jewell
408,brenicole16,Underrated,8,15 August 2020,"I'm guessing this film probably didn't do too well at the box office because it had been over 23 years since the 1996 bombing and maybe a lot of people weren't familiar with it or Richard's name anymore. I, myself, was only a kid when it all happened but the previews looked interesting enough. The acting in the film is superb! All of the actors do such a great job especially lead actor Paul Walter Hauser. I feel like he's not getting nearly as much recognition that he deserves.This film is not an ""action"" film by any means. Only action scenes that happen is the bombing and that's about it. It spends the rest of its time showing you exactly what the FBI and media did to this man. How they looked at him as this simpleton and believed they could persuade him into a confession. It's definitely drama with a small bit of comedy thrown in there but it's all done tactfully in my opinion. I do wish they had discussed more at the end of the movie about Richard's life after the instance scrutiny he was under (88 days to be exact). He sued a lot of media outlets to clear his name, it's also been said every year on the anniversary of the bombing he would privately put a single rose where Alice Hawthorne (the woman who was killed by the actual bomb) had died.But other than that it's a really good film and I feel like hugely underrated. It shows how powerful the US government and the US media really are. Definitely give it a try if you're into drama based true stories.",Richard Jewell

The acting was tremendous and all the accolades are more than deserved, many kudos for here - a great example of excellent casting that doesn't fall into The casting trapped it could have.Whether you are American or not, this is not only an important lesson and warning from history, it is also a much needed reminder of society home wrong.Watch this film, or regret it.",Richard Jewell

A real case that will show you how it works when you take a wrong turn, even more being the powerful ones, like the press and the police investigation.See, run, this one deserves, an extraordinary film, I saw and came to write to be able to warn of this good for those who haven't seen it yet. My Oscar (private) is given, take Master Eastwood.The filmmaker is the 90-year-old American, Clint Eastwood (1930), one of the greatest living men in cinema of all time, which enchanted me with some films he directed like Bronco Billy (1980), The Lone Knight (1985), Bird (1988), Coração de Caçador (1990), Cowboys do Espaço (2000), Invictus (2009), J. Edgar (2011), and now this is your last film so far (I made a list of the films that I liked the most, do you have yours, what is it?).The protagonists are led by the American actor Paul Walter Hauser, who made a lot of TV and has acted among others in: by Eu, Tonya (2017) and infiltrated in Klan (2018).

419,bydook,a big hero of the little people,10,26 February 2020,"Clint Eastwood is the living embodiment not only of the American cinematography but of the American spirit as well. At least, the ideal I personally believe the American spirit is. He created many truly iconic characters as an actor and now we can enjoy another wonderful movie that he did as a director. 'Richard Jewell' is a movie based on the real events. It is a deeply psychological social drama. It is a story about modest hero, coming form the little people of America, the people that used to be called 'a silent majority'. He is everything that modern ""progressive people"" consider to be ""not cool"". He is white man with traditional views and deep respect for the law and order, with a figure of an officer of the law enforcement as a role model. He possesses guns, he shoots for the recreation with the NRA members, he hunts. He works honestly and he truly believes in the System. And the System fails him, the System uses him as a scapegoat, the System tears his life apart.This exact story ends well. But how many such richards were left unheard, alone with their despair? No wonder, that 'a silent majority' is no longer silent, that it rebelled against the establishment in the US - and we can see the same processes all over the world. Eastwood heard this story of the heartland of America. And he told it us masterfully.",Richard Jewell

The FBI agents involved in this fiasco were a bunch of ignorant cops bent on playing the blame game with no evidence linking this poor man to the crime. The only thing that angered me more was the snub by the Motion Picture Academy. Clint Eastwood's masterful direction of this deep character driven drama is his best ever. Sam Rockwell's performance, quiet, yet confident, is the glue that holds this unfortunate, yet true, story together. Paul Walter Hauser's portrayal of Richard Jewell is the most spot on docudrama representation since Val Kilmer's turn as Jim Morrison. I am as angered by the headhunting incompetence of the FBI in this story as I am by the Academy which showed it's ignorance in overlooking this Jewell of a film!",Richard Jewell

I've enjoyed some of his work but nothing as much as Richard Jewell. An incredible story to be sure, but the directorial mastery that was showcased here is the star of the show. The beautiful cinematography, engaging sound design and expert editing all highlight an incredible cast as they perfectly embody characters who we instantly know and feel strongly about. The sense of tension, frustration, anguish and eventual relief that this film evokes is powerful and its themes are right on the money.Now more than maybe any other time we ought to remember the importance of truth, integrity and honor. Let us take this as an opportunity to pursue those values in our lives individually and demand them of those who sit above us in the positions of power we grant them, either with our votes or with our attention.",Richard Jewell

The actor playing Richard Jewell has his look and mannerisms down perfectly. He did an outstanding job. What the media did to him was horrible.

This movie shows the horror of just that.

Although the events in this movie took place in 1996, the movie is incredibly topical. IT JUST SO HAPPENS TO ILLUSTRATE THE CORRUPTION OF THE GOVERNMENT AND THE MEDIA. It reveals their house of cards, their unscrupulous morality and their underhanded methodology. Sound familiar? This as the ends always justify the means, when you have no soul or moral compass. Get the story or solve the case, in this instance. ANY ENTITY THAT ATTEMPTS TO CONTROL YOUR FREEDOM AND OR THE NARRATIVE IS ALWAYS NEFARIOUS.

430,siredercoucy,I remember when it was happening,9,14 December 2019,"This movie has a lot of unmentioned ties to the civil rights era which I grew up in. Back then it was racial profiling. The black guy did it. I saw that many times living in the south. Part of the bomber profile is white. Of course like when I was growing up there was a reason, and I use the term sarcastically, to say it was probably a black guy. And now they say they have a reason to say it was a white guy. Another issue is the inability for Jewell to sue for slander. The court rulings and laws that make it very difficult to sue for slander date back to the civil rights era. People on both sides of the issue were suing newspapers to shut them up or shut them down. This movie really deserves a number of Academy awards. The acting is excellent. The movie moves along fast. It really shows how the FBI needed to close this case and anybody convenient would due. The newspapers wanted to sell newspapers.

kathy bates also played her part well, she did at times though come across with a slight tinge of over acting.

Awesome dialogue throughout. A heart-wrenching story that packs some great comedic lines as well. I would probably give it a 9, but since I saw a couple of reviews give it a ONE (no way that is a fair review!) I added a bonus point. The acting is top notch and the movie deserves several awards, however I cannot see today's Hollywood honoring a movie that dares to rip the mainstream media. All high school students should have to watch this movie to warn them that what you see on ""the news"" may not be true. And even when it is proven false, no problem, they simply move on to the next story that they hope will draw ratings. Like most True Story movies, there is some parts that may not be true. The reporter may not have slept with an agent to get her information. But that isn't very vital. It is what everyone did with that information. I understand the media can't be trusted, but the FBI? Very sad and scary. Mr. Eastwood is an American icon and thankfully someone who doesn't have to care what modern Tinseltown thinks of his product. He told a story that needed to be told because too many in power would want us to forget this egregious treatment of a Joe Lunchbucket Hero. WATCH THIS MOVIE WITH AN OPEN MIND. You will laugh.

451,steveo554,"liberties were taken, but absolutely necessary",9,11 November 2020,"I freaking love this movie. I would say that it expanded Clint Eastwood's strengths as a director. I personally hate using the word ""timely"" because just because a movie comes out with a message that's popular now doesn't mean it'll age well. That being said, this story is probably more relevant now than it was back then.For those who are unaware, Richard Jewell was a security guard that caught a bomb that exploded in the 1996 Atlanta Olympics. At first, he was hailed as a hero, but the media and FBI portrayed him as the guy who planted it despite no real evidence.The performances are outstanding. Paul Walter Heuser was the perfect choice to play Jewell as the guy with a good heart that got thrown in the wringer. I dare say this is one of Rockwell's best if not his best performance since he won the Oscar for Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri. And yet, only Kathy Bates gets nominated for the Oscar as Bobi. The only issue I have is with Olivia Wilde, and it's not really her fault. I will get to that much later.Eastwood really does a solid job in directing this ensemble. I've seen a number of his films where everyone revolves around one lead actor. This is not the case. Jewell may have been the ""main"" character, but Rockwell, Wilde, and Hamm take the show each time they're on screen. The pacing is solid; no scene feels like it drags on, and you feel the pain and the misery of the situation even when the story itself may not feel that exhilarating.That being said, this movie isn't without ""controversy"". People were upset that Wilde's character, Kathy Scruggs, was portrayed as a lascivious sleaze who slept with an FBI agent to get the scoop. This didn't really happen (or at least there's no proof), and the fact that she died in 2001 makes it even harder to prove. It's similar to how Ava Duvernay's documentary 13th included an infamous quote by Ehrlichman even though the quote didn't really surface until AFTER he died. There's no verification of proof. My concern, however, is that Wilde's performance comes off as really over-the-top. She's a good actress, but even I look at her and think this character is a parody of a journalist.Another tidbit I love about this movie is the dialogue. It's natural enough not to feel like a script but contains enough moments of dialogue to stick with you. There's a scene where Bryant brings Jewell into the AJC office demanding a retraction and confronts Scruggs. She hides behind reporting the facts, to which he retorts ""what about the truth?"". This hits hard the problem with our current state of journalism: major media outlets spin statements that are correct but not true. It isn't just misreporting but misconceiving. Even though all they reported was that Jewell was seen as a suspect, it was the implication that mattered.In short: facts don't care about your feelings, but facts can be used to boost a lie.This movie is a modern fable about the use of power and that even with the best intentions, people can abuse it to hurt without consideration. Hamm's obsession with covering his tracks drove him to want to get back at Jewell. Scruggs obsession with getting the front page led her to drag Jewell's name in the mud. As Bryant says in the movie, ""This isn't the United States government. It's just a bunch of pricks who work for the United States government."" It reminds us that the forces designed to protect or inform us may not always do so. Yes, it's not 100% accurate, so you'll need to keep to your wits. However, you will not be disappointed.",Richard Jewell

Not dumb jokes but humor that comes from situations and personalities. Also, the treatment of characters surprised me because they weren't one-note. You keep learning things about them.Look, just go see this movie while it's still at the cinema. I promise you, there's no orange-man stuff in it.

However the acting was superb, the directing was well ... Eastwood. I do not agree with the critics that Kathy Scruggs was displayed in bad light. Actually she was a very dynamic character with some flaws and some good traits. ""MeToo"" movement may claim that powerful men are abusing the poor women, but the reality knows many examples when beautiful women had used their beauty to get what they want from the powerful men.Neither the journalists nor FBI were shown as bad people. FBI followed a tip and Richard Jewel matched the profile. Journalists printed whatever information they had. Maybe they were quick to judge but in their line of work being slow in reacting may prove fatal.There was one character that made me sick in my stomach though - the President of the Piedmont College. He was the guy who tipped the FBI and started all this travesty. We have all seen such people. Nowadays the liberal colleges are full of them. They are useless as scientists or teachers.

We felt so devastated when we found out the journalists were so opportunistic there. The movie captures all of that. A compelling, engaging portrayal. Clint Eastwood nailed it.

461,watermelon-96819,"Great job, Eastwood",8,6 January 2021,"This film directed by Clint Eastwood is based on a true story in which Richard Jewell, a security guard becomes a prime suspect of the bomb attack in a concert during the Atlantic Olympics in 1996. Immediately after the attack Richard Jewell is hailed as a hero to have saved citizens, until the moment the FBI starts to investigate him as a terrorist.In the park where the Olympic events are screened, Richard Jewell is the first one to witness the bomb, and alerts others to the danger of the bomb. Consequently, the FBI concludes that he is the terrorist and utilizes many strategies to find evidence, or make him confess. In addition to this, the media frenzy to call him a bomber becomes an enemy of Richard Jewell. This film explores a fight between Richard, his mother and lawyer, and the FBI agents.A powerful film - it is pleasing to see that Clint Eastwood shed light on this story about Richard Jewell. It was a scathing reminder of how an innocent citizen who once hailed as a hero, could easily turn into a terrorist suspect. The power of the FBI and media becomes evident during the film - their manipulation and relentless attack could utterly destroy an individual. The three actors' performances stole this film - Paul Walter Hauser as Richard Jewell, Sam Rockwell as his lawyer, and Kathy Bates as his mother. Their convincing and heart-warming performances were the highlights of this film.",Richard Jewell

463,syhcoach,(not) surprised at the low user rating,9,10 January 2020,"After seeing this film, I went on to IMDB to see the user reviews. I was surprised to see it rank significantly lower than ""Knives Out""; a film that while occasionally entertaining, I frankly thought was somewhat shallow and vacuous.I won't go into my thoughts as to the pros/cons of this film; that has been adequately covered by 170+ reviewers. What really amazed me was the number of glowing reviews that only posted 6-7 stars.Digging deeper, I realized that most of the negative reviews were made on strictly political lines. I am saddened by the fact that we as a society can no longer separate our objective evaluation of art from our subjective political opinions. That is really too bad, and what leads to such abortions as ""The New Ghostbusters"".I was really moved by this film; both by the struggle of its protagonist against the oppression of a huge, powerful state bureaucracy and media, and the very human tragedy of the Olympic bombing. As to the bombing itself, I nearly fell out of my seat when it happened, even though I knew it was coming, and I was in a recliner at my local cinema.I did not give this 10 stars, as I felt the portrayal of the Atlanta female correspondent was not realistic (I wont go further to avoid spoilers).And for those of you who think Clint Eastwood is a Republican shill who only released this film to support a Trump re-election (yes, there are reviews that state that): do your homework. Eastwood stated in an interview that he has wanted to make this film for many years (read: during the Obama administration).",Richard Jewell

Given the Trumpian world we're living in an FBI bashing movie where the ""hero"" is a socially maladjusted gun nut who lives with his Mum certainly stands out from the pack. The director Clint Eastwood's political leanings are well known but given the production credits and cast include well-known liberals such as Di Caprio and Olivia Wilde it's probably unwise to jump to any rash conclusions.
Eastwood undoubtedly knows how to make a movie. The performances he draws from the central cast are all very impressive and it's unsurprising that they have picked up acting nominations here and there.
Paul Walter Hauser first caught my attention as the none too smart henchman in I, Tonya and here he also excels playing a similarly challenged character. Mentions should also go to Sam Rockwell , Kathy Bates and Olivia Wilde.
In conclusion it's a very well made movie about an interesting true story and well worth 2 hours of anybody's time.",Richard Jewell

474,shaneunknownster,Favourite film of the year,10,27 February 2020,"Whenever I go to a film these days its mostly because I've heard about it somewhere but not with the film Richard Jewell. It originally caught my attention for one reason and that was Sam Rockwell. He's one of them actors I feel you can just never go wrong with and once again he showed me how wonderful an actor he is and among many in this film I must say. I'd never heard of the film or even the story to be honest so I didn't know what to expect. I thoroughly enjoyed this film from start to finish. It had everything that I like in a film laughter, tears, drama, the quality of acting across the board I thought was just superb. I just like films simply that tell a good story says something meaningful and hands out a bit of advice for your fellow man ( a standard I believe Charles Dickins lived by) and this ticks all the boxes. I shouldn't be surprised to see it hasn't done that great in the box office but it still makes me sad it hasn't. I just hope that this is another cult classic for future generations. Truly a breathe of fresh air. I hope it gets the credit it deserves eventually. Well done Clint Eastwood you never cease to amaze me.

Elements are made, designed, and selected correctly although I didn't understand why the news reporter changed from an opportunist to a sentimental person weeping for her victim of false news coverage. Also, Eastwood could spend more time on building the bond between the lawyer (Sam Rockwell) and Richard (Paul Walter Hauser) at the beginning. The movie does not question the system as it is believed by critics-, but I believe it exposes a neglect agent (Jon Hamm) who does not want to take the blame (for his weakness on the reporter girl) and tries to chase the easiest and quickest ways.",Richard Jewell

The consequences of which caused him to be assumed guilty by the public.A truly sad and unfortunate story, with excellent acting from all key players and surprisingly impressive visuals. Clint Eastwood as crafted yet another fine motion picture.It's a shame that many in the media chose to effectively boycott this film, and slandered it as being anti-journalistic. If this film's critics actually watched it, they would realize that this movie's main Journalist Antagonist (Kathy Scruggs) was portrayed quite remorsefully and sympathetically later in the film after Richard Jewell's innocence became obvious. If go into this film expecting to see Kathy Scruggs as the textbook ""Bad Guy"", you'll come out of feeling otherwise.In My Opinion; This film was not a damnation of the press, but simply a reminder for Journalistic Prudence.",Richard Jewell

The lens this should really be viewed under is Hollywood showcasing their moral bankruptcies. Another shameful project at a time when film should be giving clarity and educating to the audience, not creating propaganda.

It is very important to highlight these horrid instances in our society.I'm seeing a lot of politically motivated reviews here that are laughably attempting to use their reviews to positively compare Trump to Jewell.First of all the media being inaccurate is not an issue of politics but an issue of truth. The media has damaged many lives including the Exonerated Five who Trump continues to say are guilty despite DNA evidence. Trump actually manipulated the media to convince people these kids were guilty.While the film is directed by Eastwood, and outspoken Trump supporter, it was produced by Leonardo DiCaprio who is an outspoken liberal. The film simply arguing truth is what matters, and the media can be a very powerful entity and shifting the world's view of people.Now the actual movie: while it is brilliantly performed, and directed it misses many opportunities to further explore our antagonists. We just see what they start, but they dont really go anywhere. I understand the film is primarily about what Jewell went through but we dont really get to know our other characters.The film isnt quite as powerful as ""When They See Us"" which explores many of the same themes as this film but it is a fine watch.

The film gets intense around the time he is working at Centennial Park, before the event, and continues throughout the film. From then on, he quickly turns from Hero, to Villain. He is just harassed to no end. And he isn't alone. There are some tender moments, as he, his Mother are under a very strong spotlight. I think Clint Eastwood did a very good job.

522,integritysa,One of the best movies I've seen in years,10,26 December 2019,"This is a home run. Regardless of any political leanings you might have, this is a powerful story about how ""rush to judgment"" can utterly ruin lives. One of the reviewers mentions the ""guilty until proven innocent"" mentality which, sadly, prevails in our society today. We want answers and we want them NOW. We want someone to blame and we want him or her NOW. The media, in a desire to ""scoop"" their competition, is voracious in their accusations. Law enforcement (in this case, it was the FBI) is pressured to ""solve"" alarming cases, sometimes relying on flimsy evidence, or on faulty profiles which they've amassed from prior cases.
This is a story of clear violations of civil rights (perhaps the ACLU should see it...).
On another note, the performances are excellent, the story line is gripping and well-developed, and there is an overall authenticity about the movie that is extremely satisfying.
This, in my view, ranks with ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" for impact. That was an amazing adaptation of a wonderful novel; ""Richard Jewell"" is a storytelling masterpiece of actual events.",Richard Jewell
523,jridgway-26060,"A Spot-on film about unfair judgements in the News Media, with great acting, script and direction",9,13 January 2020,"Many people do not know the story of Richard Jewell because it was largely suppressed by the major news media after they were caught doing what they do -- rushing to judgement, smearing with innuendo, and twisting the facts. This great docu-drama by Clint Eastwood exposes the Media Machine and the FBI as the villians in this case, in contrast to Richard Jewell, his Mother and lawyer as the little good guys fighting back to clear his name. It's very, very well acted and what it ends up being is an intimate and emphathetic look inside a person and a family undergoing total media/law enforcement attack. In the end they prevail, but not before their lives (and the viewer's emotions) go through the ringer!All acting performances were great in this movie! Paul Walter Hauser -- should've gotten an Oscar nomination! Kathy Bates as his Mom -- DID get a well-deserved nomination. Also Sam Rockwell as his lawyer, Olivia Wilde as the female reporter who uses her sensuality to get leads, and Jon Hamm as a jerky arrogant FBI guy were really well acted. (Jon Hamm tends to be good in those roles!)The story's lead-in to the bombing masterfully builds tension. The actions of the arrogant and close-minded FBI outrage the viewer with their sleazy tactics. But it's the hysterical, rush-to-judgement Media who are the real jerks in this story. If you've gotten the FBI and the Media against you, you are really screwed, but if you have Truth on your side, you have a fighting chance!I wonder how many follow-up interviews Richard Jewell got with major news outlets, after it was confirmed that he was not only innocent, but the HERO of that day? I would say not many. Being part of the liberal media means never having to say you're sorry. It's no wonder why so many media film critics closed ranks and put this film down! Thanks for this one, Clint Eastwood! A highly recommended film that will leave you thinking about it for days.",Richard Jewell

A female journalist writes the article that says Richard Jewell is the main suspect on the front page of the local newspaper. She is too ambitious and she hasn't sprit of journalism nor justice. She just writes that he is the suspect because a policeman says that. That is too stupid, what is more, she gets the information by sexually attracting. I hate that kind of journalist.When the explosion occurs, the journalist prays that she could get a scoop and the criminal would be a weird person to attract people's attention.
Her biggest interest is to put the article on the top page with her signature as fast as possible.Journalists are more or less ambitious, they are told to get a big scoop that makes headline in their company. And they are encouraged to hurry up to publish an article as soon as possible before other media do that.
Some journalists - I would like to believe they are some, not all- forget why they write the article, why media collects the information and tell the story to the public. Journalists can make the world better, but they can also fall innocent people into misery.",Richard Jewell

This movie shows why no one should ever talk to law enforcement without their lawyer present. What happened to Richard Jewell was a crime and I hope the FBI agent that leaked the story was at least fired.,Richard Jewell
526,snyc-83473,True story about how US Media destroys lives,10,29 May 2020,"Clint Eastwood's magnificent yet heartbreaking story perfectly captures the truth about a malicious and powerful media destroying lives with a few well chosen words. Journalists are moral narcissists and everything they do is evil. Malcolm X said it best ""be careful of the news people, they'll have you loving the ones doing the oppression and hating the ones being oppressed.""",Richard Jewell

529,mikhail_samylin,"Hi, I am an aspiring film critic from the Russian Federation. Please read my review and excuse me awful english",8,27 February 2021,"Yesterday I watched the movie ""The Richard Jewell Affair"". It reminds me of a good, solid leather belt worn by Western heroes - without unnecessary details, but very textured, honest and masculine.I liked the film very much, but it's a pity that it didn't get the Oscar nomination for best film, and it deserves it. Well, most likely there were just so many good films in 2019, and there were just real mastodons (Joker, Ford vs. Ferrari, 1917, Get Knives, Irishman).In my opinion, this is one of the best films based on real events.I was very worried about Richard, but seriously. Imagine you saved a bunch of lives and you were recognized as the national hero of the country, and after 3 days you were attacked by the FBI and the media (+ any word can be your last), not everyone can survive this.I recommend watching it, and most of you will most likely cry from the ending (and in some scenes too), because it is great. This is a real male film!",Richard Jewell
530,taeve-04077,Outstanding job and underrated,10,28 May 2021,One of the best movies with true history i have ever seen. Richard Jewell was played so good i fell bad for him since min 1.,Richard Jewell
531,spandanlc,Review of Richard Jewell,10,20 July 2021,"This movie is another evidence of Clinton Eastwood's brilliance. For me this is undoubtedly 10/10. The acting of each actor and actress is impeccable and the story had me captivated. Their expressions and tones perfectly matched their dialogues. The protagonist's mannerisms somewhat made the character very loving and closer to the viewers. Based on a true story, a security guard named Richard Jewell (Paul Walter Hauser) discovers a bomb under a bench in Centennial Park during Summer Olympics,1996, at Atlanta. He becomes a hero after alarming the people nearby and saving many lives as a result but things go south soon after FBI makes him their prime suspect. This movie has depicted the dark side of the law enforcement who regardless of the well being of their suspect continue to operate and are dead set on making the suspect 'guilty' without even giving enough thought to whether they really are or not. The accused is denied of his privacy and peaceful life as they are constantly interrogated and their each and every step is recorded, terribly affecting his or her mental health. To be precise this may also affect the lives of his near and dear ones after one things lead to another. Its best to take life lessons from this film as well. If you believe that you are being suspected of some kind of criminal offence do not say anything in front of the authorities, law enforcers, media, etc. As those words may be used against you and make it harder for you to defend for yourself later. Be aware of and do not give in to any tricks or traps which may further aggravate your difficult situation. Try listening to and cooperating with the best possible person(s) during that time. The role of a reckless media has also been highlighted in this film as sometimes they do not confirm the facts and run after an 'interesting' story, thus, moving further and further away from what really happened. The direction was absolutely amazing The actors completely fit into their roles. Some significant scenes such as the explosion from the incendiary device was accompanied by fantastic sound effects and beautifully carried out. It made us viewers feel as if we were in the aforementioned site during that point of time. This is really one of those films which has made a lasting impression on me.",Richard Jewell
532,DemetriosConstantinides,Another archetypal from Clint,9,2 February 2020,"Clint with ""Richard Jewell"" delivers one of his best films in the decade (2010-2019 along with the earlies ""J. Edgar"" and ""Hereafter"") and certainly one of the best films of the year!
Unfortunately the film seems to be unfairly ""quite"" ignored by the Oscars and a flaw in the US box office. I am a Greek and here the film is steadily on the top 5 for the last 4-5 weeks, i hope that the film's international career will be more rewarding.Clint is an ""auteur"", the same deep structure underlies the surface of most of his films. This deep structure renders them archetypal, universal statements of the human lot.
In the same vein as Greek tragedies also archetypal and of lasting significance by portraying disfunctional heroes at odds with society's values or institutions. Greek heroes are all doomed by defying those in power, such as gods, kings, society's established values etc...
Clint's heroes are of the same stuff as tragic heroes and Richard Jewell is one of them.
I consider the film as a tale of initiation into adulthood, maturity is a long laborious process during which a person brings in doubt and scrutiny all received values.Richard Jewell is portrayed with flaws as a character, I think though immaturity as the principal one: it is not only the kind of relation he shares with his mother, it is foremost the absence of sex in his life.
Freud said that sex is the engine, sex is power and Richard Jewell has none of it! What an excellent piece of dramaturgy the sexual exchange between the journalist and the FBA agent, Olivia Wilde's sensual explosiveness and Jon Hamms phalic stiffness against the gasping movements of Jewell's body.
Richard Jewell does not belong in the world of adults, he has not the luxury of a sexual exchange, the ony exchange he is capable of is the one with the snickers: a snicker for a friend!!!Bobi Jewell is a problematic character as well. She equally leads an a-sexual life without a companion, she only expresses her youthfull-like admiration for a TV anchorman. This lack of male figure at home is enough to explain Richard Jewell's overwhelming respect for authority figures and uniforms, the paraphernalia substitutes of a missing father.Sam Rockwell's character unlike the Jewells is sexually active, but alike them is immature if we judge by the bitter statements of his east-european companion.
This is then a ""loosy"" trinity - the virgin mother, the virgin son and the holy spirit (in the from of a lawer) - that united chooses to enter in a fight against a mighty power reprensented by the Institutions of FBI and Press, the 2 insitutions that as we have seen the Jewells duly respect!
You cannot earn adulthood without bringing down bitterly your own ""idols"".""Richard Jewell"" the movie is the long gasping movement of a character (or 3 characters) into self esteem and knowledge!
One of Clint's best, tremendous performances by Paul Walter Hauser and Sam Rockwell expressing the corporeal and spiritual dimensions of the film, for sure within the 5 best films of the year 2019! Wake up Academy!",Richard Jewell
533,crowe1324,Clint strikes again!,10,5 March 2020,Well directed and Great acting. Living in Atl. during this time the Movie depiction is right on. AJC and the CNN hasn't learned much if any of this.

538,trev_h_2_,Richard Jewell's name tainted again?,5,17 January 2020,"Other than the fact that this movie unashamedly implies that a very unfortunate Richard Jewell shares a common injustice with another chap that likes playing a lot of golf... the movie isn't half bad. The actors did a great job. The facts of the story are there but in too many scenes the context felt contrived to fit the directors political statement, and the story depth / focus narrower than it should have been. There is no way the real story has been impartially retold but that's kind of the point I imagine. And yes, Sam Rockwell is a great actor!",Richard Jewell
539,jvdw-825-747960,An engaging movie,9,29 December 2019,"As the story wound down I didn't want it to end.
That is one of my main criteria for a good to great
film - I only gave it 9 starts because they didn't
give the option of 91/2 - 10 means it's absolutely
perfect - hard to attain perfection in the real world.
I very well remember that I was sucked into the
false narrative branding Richard Jewel a terrorist.I must see movie in my book!!",Richard Jewell

548,ddunn-25517,An eye opening look at the abomination that is the news media and the Federal law enforcement,10,21 March 2020,"I remember exactly when this happened and followed the entire story. The FBI needed someone to pin it on to take the heat off themselves and Richard Jewell was there easy mark, then the news media did what they did best and sensationalized it by shredding his good, innocent name. Absolutely a travesty and miscarriage of justice and morals. Fortunately he was exonerated and went on to become a law enforcement officer. Unfortunately his life was cut short due to a terminal illness. RICHARD JEWELL, not the media, not the FBI, but Richard Jewell was and will always be the epitome of an American hero! Honor and Integrity!!",Richard Jewell
549,maxjfry,A jaded bedtime story much too emotionally-driven,4,10 June 2020,"Sympathy is shoved down the viewer's throat throughout. There's no room to develop an opinion, not even on whether you like the people. The opinion is forced onto you.An omniscient point of view is boring. We know everything from the beginning. There's no ambiguity. ""This is the way the story happened, now let's get angry that the FBI didn't fully understand the situation from the beginning."" Wouldn't a POV of a simple bystander, or even the FBI be more interesting? Why can't we learn with them?It feels like 20 minutes is spent on Tupperware. When the belongings are finally returns, the mother lifts the Tupperware with the emotion she should have for her newly exonerated son. A fine metaphor for why the focus is wrong throughout.Rapid-fire:
-the reporter has not arc
-nothing ""proves"" to the others that he's not guilty (the distance to the booth and the ""accomplice"" are never answered)
-the vindication is underwhelming as is the climax",Richard Jewell

552,Cheezewillis,Best Film of the Year,10,30 December 2019,"(Btw very light spoiler not really anything crazy) Heck, I'd go so far as to say this was one of the best films I've seen in a long time. My god. That's what I was thinking halfway through the film or maybe even just thirty minutes in. This movie just grips you. It's very very relatable and it just makes you feel so much for the main character. A man is wrongfully accused of a crime and just watching how everything falls apart in his life is so crazy. The people to the left of me were on the edge of their seats, leaning forward engrossed in the very tense scenes. I felt so anxious as things were starting to spiral out of control. The pacing the acting, everything is just on point. Everyone in the theater was laughing off! This movie is hilarious as well! And the way they figured out he was innocent by walking the steps to the payphone made me think of 12 angry men. Again, great film, I wish I could write more but it's late and I'm more interested in reading up on this movie and the actual event it's based off. Please just go watch the movie. Seriously.",Richard Jewell
