0,MartinHafer,There are already over 2000 reviews for this....,8,11 November 2018,"Because more than 2000 folks have already reviewed this film on IMDB, I'll keep my review very brief. After all...what's one more review among so many?!The movie was a bit of a shock when I found it, as somehow I really didn't hear much about it and I wasn't even sure if it had yet debuted. Much of this is because after so many ""Star Wars"" films, I find that a sort of fatigue has set in...much like how I feel about all the super hero films. But, as I was on a 13+ hour flight, I wasn't in a position to be picky and decided to watch the movie.I was surprised to read that the movie is only rated 7.0 (meaning it must have ticked off a lot of fans) and really made almost nothing at the box office. Much of this is because I actually enjoyed the picture...and more than I'd expected. The story about the young Han Solo is exciting throughout and I also appreciated its dark tone and willingness to kill off characters (much like the previous installment)...but perhaps this is why fans were not so impressed by this one. All I know is that I liked seeing a darker film and it kept my interest throughout.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
1,TheLittleSongbird,Going solo,8,3 June 2018,"Am a big fan of the original 'Star Wars' trilogy, with 'The Empire Strikes Back' my favourite but 'A New Hope' is a genre and film landmark. Don't mind the prequels actually but they are very flawed and vastly inferior. Loved 'The Force Awakens', liked very much 'Rogue One' and liked 'The Last Jedi' better than most while considering it a very uneven film.Part of me was excited to see 'Solo: A Star Wars Story', mainly to see how an origin story on one of the franchise's most iconic characters would fare and where it would fit in ranking with the other 'Star Wars' films. Also to see whether my opinions would fit in the like it category or hate it one, considering how divisive 'Solo: A Star Wars Story' would be and how troubled production was. Seeing it yesterday, my opinion leans towards the liked it category with some reservations. In ranking with the other 'Star Wars' films, it is nowhere near as good as the original trilogy or 'The Force Awakens', is on par with 'Rogue One' and quite a bit better than the prequels and 'The Last Jedi'. Am aware that all this is out of step with most fans.'Solo: A Star Wars Story' is a long way from perfect. It does offer very little new (though not exactly a re-hash) and plays it a bit too safe, apart from a couple of big twists towards the end. The romance did have amorous chemistry but didn't develop enough and should have gone further.Found some of the humour forced, especially from outspoken L3-37, who irritates somewhat rather than amuses or intrigues and the outspokenness and gender politics really doesn't gel with the rest of the film. The ending did seem to leave room for a sequel but it felt confused and incomplete.However there is a lot to like. Loved the gritty yet audacious look of the production values, particularly the way it is shot and the exemplary production design. The special effects similarly are spectacular as are the action set pieces, the train sequence is a knockout. The music score is not as iconic as John Williams' scoring, but it is rousing, intense yet also beautiful with loving references to some of the most famous themes. The script is uneven but does provoke intrigue and does entertain and have enough to keep one invested. The story is familiar, but paced tightly and often a mega thrill ride. Absolutely adored Chewbacca, who is hilarious and endearing. His chemistry with Han is one of the film's biggest driving forces and is a sheer delight. Ron Howard does more competently considering the troubled circumstances, striving to make sure that the troubles didn't show on screen and it was a goal handled successfully.Performances are good, with a charming, swaggering and suitably arrogant Aldren Ehrenreich filling in giant shoes more than admirably. The best supporting performances, other than for Chewbacca, come from Woody Harrelson, bringing nuance and command to an unpredictable character, and a charismatic Donald Glover. Paul Bettany similarly deserves praise for making a very underutilised character malevolent and Emilia Clarke is enigmatic and luminous.Overall, a very enjoyable film that had room to be quite a bit better. 8/10 Bethany Cox",Solo - A Star Wars Story
2,bkoganbing,Star Wars back story film,6,14 January 2019,"Young Alden Ehrenreich steps into the large shoes of Harrison Ford as we learn
about the iconic character Han Solo's beginning, including how he teamed up with
a Wookie.Without disturbing the elements of the three classic Star Wars films that George
Lucas did, the Disney company seems determined to explore and dare I say it,
exploit the Star Wars franchise since they acquired the rights.As we saw when we met Han Solo way back in the day he's a guy who's no better than he ought to be, making a living with a little honest smuggling and
piracy. In this case he comes under the tutelage of a master criminal played
by Woody Harrelson.Ehrenreich goes out on a job with Harrelson to steal coaxium, a much in demand hyper fuel which will put anything that flies into warp drive or is that
that other science fiction franchise? It doesn't go as planned, but during the
course of things Han Solo now makes the acquaintance of his lifelong sidekick
Chewbacca.Lando Kalrissian played here by Donald Glover is another guy no better than
he ought and he and Solo hit it off. Even before we reach the time of the
Star Wars prime films, these two will do much business together.Ron Howard with both the characters and the spirit of Star Wars does a nice
job in keeping the saga going. No doubt Disney will do more back story
type films in the future.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
3,Leofwine_draca,Perfectly serviceable,6,26 November 2018,"SOLO is the latest stand-alone STAR WARS adventure and a follow-up to ROGUE ONE. This one's a prequel telling of the origins of Han Solo, how he met all his buddies (Lando, Chewie) and how he ended up as a fighter ace piloting the Millennium Falcon. It's a perfectly serviceable kind of movie, overlong and without much in the way of depth or originality, but certainly watchable and enjoyable at times. The CGI work is generally good and there's a wealth of action to keep your mind off the simplicity of the story. The central casting is less than impressive, with the lead actor doing nothing more than a Harrison Ford impression and Emilia Clarke feeling somehow false, like she did in TERMINATOR: GENISYS. Woody Harrelson plays these roles on autopilot by now and Paul Bettany is given little to do. I still stick by my impression that, of the STAR WARS franchise, only the original trilogy is worth bothering with, and all these prequels and sequels fail to recapture the same magic.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
4,SnoopyStyle,Necessary?,6,15 September 2018,"On the planet Corellia, young runaway couple Han (Alden Ehrenreich) and Qi'ra (Emilia Clarke) struggles under the protection and order of the local gang. Han steals a vial of fuel to bribe themselves off planet but Qi'ra is caught. He joins the Imperial Academy hoping to be a pilot and return to Corellia to save Qi'ra. Instead, he's relegated to being a trooper fighting on a muddy planet. He gets arrested for desertion and befriends a Wookiee named Chewbacca. They escape and join Beckett (Woody Harrelson) and Val (Thandie Newton) on a train heist for more of that fuel. They return to crime lord Dryden Vos (Paul Bettany) where he is surprised to encounter Qi'ra who has become Vos' trusted lieutenant.Movies are not necessary but is this movie even well advised? There may well be a way to do a young Han movie but one must understand his character in episode 4. He's a scoundrel who at the last minute joins the good side. It's an inflection point in his life and it gets diminished when he has a trial run in this movie. That's what this is. It's his journey in episode 4 except he leaves before accepting his medal. This would be better if this character is not named Han Solo and why do we need an explanation of his name Han Solo anyways? As a simple space thriller, it's fine but not great. It tries to be fun and irreverent but I don't find much fun in it. As for the ending reveal, Star Wars keeps making the galaxy smaller and more tightly wound. It needs to expand this world but with all the planet hopping, it never really expands anything. It takes all the little snippets of history from the franchise and manufactured a functional story construction. It works but it inspires nothing.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
5,Prismark10,Flying Solo,6,29 August 2018,"Solo: A Star Wars Story is a film no one really asked for and it had a troubled production history as the original co-directors got fired for having an irrelevant tone.Ron Howard was drafted in as a safe pair of hands and he constructs an exciting enough adventure which most of us will forget few hours after watching the film.The biggest problem is getting an actor to fill Harrison Ford's boots as a young Han Solo. Aldren Ehrenreich goes for more of his own thing which is wise in retrospect.His Solo is a cocky smuggler looking for that elusive break so he can start a new life with his girl, Qi'ra (Emilia Clarke). After forcibly being separated from her, Solo wants to go back looking for her but ends up joining the Empire as a pilot. However he has trouble following orders.Solo then hooks up with crook for hire Tobias Beckett (Woody Harrelson) for an elaborate heist, that one big score but nothing goes his way.We see Solo meet Chewbacca when the soldiers of the Empire throw him to fight with the beast. He plays a crooked game of cards with Lando Calrissian (Donald Glover.) All along he is among people not to be trusted, many have their own agendas, some who have formed deadly alliances.An entertaining spectacle which had one time threatened to be a mess. However this is a minor edition in the Stars Wars canon.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
6,nogodnomasters,I'm an Outlaw,9,19 June 2018,"A film that boosts both Woody Harrelson and Clint Howard can't be all bad. The Han Solo backstory includes his meeting Chewbacca and obtaining the Millennium Falcon. It does not establish his relationship with Jabba the Hutt something that would have made the film more interesting and maybe a Katina scene. The film does allow for a sequel to fill in where it left off and episode IV picks up. The film is not complex. There is no ""force."" It is the simple fun we have come to expect.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
7,kosmasp,Going Solo,6,18 October 2018,"I guess it might be a bit too late. Back when Harrison Ford made the character cool, it might have been relevant, but now? It seems even the hardcore fans didn't really want this. Then there is the timing. Apparently fans are not fond of Star Wars in cinema in the spring time. I guess they could've gone with a release date closer to May the fourth ... you don't have to be a Star Wars nerd to know the reference here.And I am anything but. I really came late to the whole thing. So I'm not really a fan of the first hour. I can't give you that perspective. I liked the movies overall, but I'm not crazy about them. And the same goes for this. I think it's nice, which is also what I think of most of the others too. It's entertainment and it works. None of my ""dreams"" or childhood memories are destroyed by this. It is a movie with cool actors (though Han is a bit bland I must admit, but has great support overall) and of course very well made (effects and all that) ...",Solo - A Star Wars Story
8,classicsoncall,"""You might wanna buckle up, baby!""",9,15 December 2018,"To paraphrase Han Solo regarding the movie, I had a pretty good feeling about it. I thought it had some of the magic reinstituted by ""Rogue 1"" that was missing from ""The Force Awakens"" and ""The Last Jedi"". While watching, I experienced some of the same feelings that I had forty years ago watching a movie that in the future would be retitled ""A New Hope"". Actually, that's what I think I liked about this picture, it filled in some of the gaps that were alluded to in the very first trilogy, like how Han Solo won the Millenium Falcon from Lando Calrissian (Donald Glover) in a card game, or how Han made the Kessel Run in less than twelve parsecs. We even learned here that Han fudged that number by rounding down, which means in the earlier stories, his braggadocio was entirely exaggerated. Not to mention that the route through the Akkadese Maelstrom was actually a short cut, measured in distance and not in time.Given the iconic status of Harrison Ford in the SW universe, I thought Alden Ehrenreich did a capable job filling some mighty big shoes. He had Han's guile and arrogance down fairly well, but still managed a likeability factor as an intergalactic outlaw. The early appearance of Woody Harrelson threw me for a loop, but he made the duplicitous character of Tobias Beckett work in a story that relied on a number of plot twists and surprises. When it came time near the end of the movie to settle accounts, the way Han responded with that unexpected shot that killed Beckett was reminiscent of the way Harrison Ford's character did the same against a tribal warrior as Indiana Jones in ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"". I wouldn't know if that was some kind of nod to the Ford Solo, but one could make the argument.The only thing that bothered me about the movie was the equal rights agenda for robots, pretty much on display any time L3-37 was involved as Lando Calrissian's droid pilot. There was even a hint of a Lando/L3 'romance' that was kind of creepy, so it didn't bother me one bit when the bad guys took L3 apart. But it was all overshadowed by the fun way the movie connected a lot of the previously unknown dots in the Star Wars universe, bringing a degree of fun back into the franchise. If Disney can maintain the same level of writing and sense of adventure with other Star Wars spin-offs, it would be a good thing for long time fans like myself.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
9,jboothmillard,Solo: A Star Wars Story,7,31 May 2018,"One was a really good prequel, fitting nicely in between Revenge of the Sith and A New Hope, this new Star Wars prequel movie fits in a similar position, I was hoping for another worthwhile watch, directed by Ron Howard (Splash, Cocoon, Apollo 13, A Beautiful Mind, Rush). Basically on Corellia, a shipbuilding world of, orphaned children are made to steal in order to survive. Young Han (Hail, Caesar's Alden Ehrenreich) and his lover Qi'ra (Game of Thrones' Emilia Clarke) escape a local gang chasing them. In exchange for passage for outgoing transportation, they bribe an Imperial officer with a stolen sample of the powerful hyperspace fuel coaxium. But before she can board, Qi'ra is apprehended by their pursuers, Han vows to return for her and joins the Imperial Navy as a flight cadet, as he is alone a recruiting officer gives him the surname ""Solo"". Three years later, Han has been expelled from the Imperial Flight Academy for insubordination, he serves as an infantryman during a battle on the planet Mimban, there he encounters a gang of criminals posing as Imperial soldiers led by Tobias Beckett (Woody Harrelson). Han tries blackmailing them to take him with them, but Beckett has him arrested for desertion and thrown into a pit to be fed to a beast, which is a Wookiee named Chewbacca (Joonas Suotamo). Speaking his language, Han persuades the Wookiee to work together to escape confinement, Beckett rescues them, for extra hands, and enlists them in the gang as part of a plot to steal a shipment of coaxium on the planet Vandor. The plan fails when Cloud Riders and their leader Enfys Nest (Erin Kellyman) show up, resulting in the deaths of crew members Val (Thandie Newton) and Rio Durant (Jon Favreau), and the coaxium shipment is destroyed. Beckett reveals he was ordered to steal the shipment for high-ranking crime boss Dryden Vos (Paul Bettany), from the Crimson Dawn syndicate, Han and Chewbacca volunteer to help steal another shipment to repay the debt. They travel to the yacht owned by Vos, where Han finds Qi'ra, she has joined Crimson Dawn and become a top lieutenant. Han suggests a risky plan to steal unrefined coaxium from the mines on the planet Kessel, Vos approves but insists that Qi'ra accompany the team. Qi'ra takes them to accomplished smuggler and pilot Lando Calrissian (Donald Glover), who she hopes will lend them his ship, Han challenges Lando to a game of sabacc, with the wager being Lando's ship. Lando cheats to win, but he agrees to join the mission in exchange for a share of the profits, the team board his ship, the Millennium Falcon, and they head for Kessel. After reaching the planet and infiltrating the mine, Lando's droid co-pilot L3-37 (Phoebe Waller-Bridge) instigates a slave revolt, this confusion allows them to steal a consignment of coaxium, but L3 is severely damaged and Lando is injured during the escape. The crew use L3's navigational computer, hotwired into the Falcon's systems, Han pilots the ship and takes a dangerous route to elude an Imperial blockade, the Falcon is badly damaged and lands on the planet Savareen to process the coaxium. During a confrontation with Enfys, who has tracked the team from Vandor, Lando flees in the Falcon. Enfys explains to Han that she and her crew are not pirates, but rebels trying to prevent the syndicates and the Empire from gaining power. Han becomes sympathetic to their cause and tries to trick Vos, but Beckett has double-crossed Han and already alerted Vos, who sends his guards to kill Enfys, but the Cloud Riders kill them instead, leaving Vos defenseless. Han has anticipated Vos' strategy, he tries to take the coaxium, only for Beckett to escape with it and take Chewbacca hostage. Qi'ra kills Vos and sends Han after Beckett, once she is alone, she contacts Vos's superior, Maul (Ray Park, voiced by Sam Witwer), to inform him about the mission's failure and Vos's position within the syndicate. Han catches up to Beckett and kills him, and he and Chewbacca turn the coaxium over to Enfys, she offers Han a chance to join the rebellion against the Empire, he declines, she says he will one day change his mind. Enfys gives him one vial of coaxium, enough to buy a ship of his own, Han and Chewbacca locate Lando and challenge him to a rematch in sabacc, but Han spots that Lando will cheat him again. Lando once again wagers the Falcon, Han has stolen the card Lando kept up his sleeve in order to cheat, Han wins, and he and Chewbacca leave for Tatooine, where a gangster (Jabba the Hutt) is putting together a crew for a heist. Also starring Linda Hunt as Lady Proxima, Ian Kenny as Rebolt, John Tui as Korso, Warwick Davis as Weazel, Clint Howard as Ralakili and Anthony Daniels as Tak. Ehrenreich is a good choice as the wisecracking smuggler, he does a lot like a younger Harrison Ford, and supporting stars Harrelson, Clarke and Glover give terrific performances, you could argue that is slightly more style over substance, it has great special effects and fast-paced chase and fight sequences, but the story is perhaps not as well crafted in places, at least this film fills in some gap for hardcore fans, it is very possible there will be more prequels to fill in other gaps, all in all this film is a fun science-fiction fantasy action adventure. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Visual Effects. Very good!",Solo - A Star Wars Story
10,BA_Harrison,Here's my two credits's worth...,7,28 May 2018,"Given its troubled production history, and the fact that Disney seem to be milking the Star Wars franchise for all its worth with little regard for the fans, I expected this to be a lot worse than it actually is. Not that the film is anything great, mind you (Rogue One remains the best of the recent Star Wars movies), but it delivers plenty of mindless slam-bang action, and little of the absurd nonsense that seriously marred The Last Jedi.Alden Ehrenreich takes on the role made famous by Harrison Ford, and does a reasonable job of it, maybe not with all of the cocky swagger of his predecessor, but certainly more than passable; likewise, Donald Glover makes for a likeable Lando Calrissian. I wish I could say the same for Emilia Clarke as Han's love interest Qi'ra, but she is even less tolerable than Daisy Ridley (and that takes some doing).As expected, the special effects driven scenes are jaw-dropping, with a heist on a speeding mono-rail train thingy being the action highlight (which unfortunately comes too early, meaning that the rest of the film can only be considered a slight disappointment by comparison). On the more negative side is Lando Calrissian's female droid L3-37, an irritating concession to political correctness, a metal SJW who fights for rights of droids.All told, Solo is a mixed bag of good, bad and mediocre that, under different circumstances, might have been much better. But at least it's not The Last Jedi.6.5/10, rounded up to 7 for the fun scene where Han meets Chewie for the first time.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
11,paul_haakonsen,"Flying Solo, but still flying in to secure a worthy place in the ""Star Wars"" saga...",7,12 June 2018,"It took me a bit of time before actually getting around to traverse to the cinema and get to watch ""Solo: A Star Wars Story"". And in that time I had been hearing mostly nothing but grief and moaning from the fan-boys whom still are not done crying about ""The Last Jedi"".Regardless of all the bad mouthing that this addition to the ""Star Wars"" saga, then I would go to watch it anyway. Why? Well, because I am a fan of ""Star Wars"" and have been ever since ""A New Hope"". And guess what? Yeah, I liked ""The Last Jedi"" quite a lot. Deal with it!I will say that ""Solo: A Star Wars Story"" was definitely in tune with everything that is ""Star Wars"" and fitted right into the saga, and I find it to be a nice addition to the saga. Sure, we already knew the events that would transpire in this movie, as we were well-familiar with the Han Solo character already from the previous movies, and also from the novels, etc. But still, it was a blast to sit down and watch it on the screen.The special effects in ""Solo: A Star Wars Story"" were great, as they have been ever since the very first ""Star Wars"" movie, so you know what you are getting here. And they added a lot of details in all of the scenes, which means that you can go to watch the movie the first time for the story alone, then go back to watch it again for the details and such in the scenes.I am a big fan of practical effects, and it was such a treat to see all the various species of aliens that they managed to put into the movie throughout the various scenes. That was just a wonderful treat for us ""Star Wars"" nerds.The storyline was fast-paced and fitted the Han Solo character quite well. Of course, it wasn't entirely without flaws. There were some, naturally. The biggest issue here for me, though it hardly made it for a less enjoyable movie experience, was the fact that the movie was lacking a proper villain. There was a lack of an iconic villain to stand against the heroes, and that Dryden Vos character (played by Paul Bettany) was just bland and made you shrug.I was initially a bit hesitant about how the outcome would be with Emilia Clarke in a prominent role, because she is stripped of proper acting talent. Luckily she didn't have that much of an overshadowing character in the storyline.Alden Ehrenreich faired adequately as Han Solo; he had some massive shoes to fill out after Harrison Ford. Did he manage to do so? No. Not really. With that being said, let me just clarify that he was not doing a poor job, he just didn't have that scoundrel charisma and attitude that Harrison Ford pulled off with this character.As for Donald Glover, well I was also a bit worried about him having the role of Lando Calrissian, that being because of his former roles in TV series. But, oh boy, did Donald Glover step up to the legacy left by Billy Dee Williams; he was really nicely cast as a young Lando, and he really nailed Billy Dee's mannerisms and speech pattern right on the head.Now, Woody Harrelson was an interesting choice of actor for a ""Star Wars"" movie and that had me something baffled when I first heard of it. But, this is Woody Harrelson after all, and yeah, he carried himself very well within the confines of the ""Star Wars"" universe.True to the saga, then there is elements of action, drama, romance, comedy and the like in this installment to the ""Star Wars"" saga. One of the more memorable things in ""Solo: A Star Wars Story"" was L3-37. Boy, that was just hilarious, and it actually did fit quite well into the story and ""Star Wars"" as a whole.I was genuinely entertained by ""Solo: A Star Wars Story"", and am just irritated that I waited over 2 weeks after its first showing at the cinema to actually go there to watch it. I went with my 8 year old son, and he also enjoyed this movie quite a lot.There is no doubt that ""Solo: A Star Wars Story"" will continue to get a lot of grief and bad mouthing. But these fan-boys were unable and unfit to deal with the fact that Rian Johnson did what a movie experience is meant to do; which is entertain you and give you something unexpected. Just funny to see their worlds crumble as they didn't get the result that they were expecting, nay praying for.All in all, then if you are a fan of ""Star Wars"", then ""Solo: A Star Wars Story"" is a most worthy addition to the saga.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
12,tavm,Solo: A Star Wars Story was a worthy additional entry in the iconic movie series,9,6 June 2018,"You know, while I've seen the original Star Wars trilogy (Eps. IV to VI), I haven't seen them as repeatedly as some of the more die-hard ones so I don't always remember certain lines or scenes. It's only looking at trivia points here on IMDb that I know about those lines and scenes and I then start to remember how enjoyable many of them were as a kid. I do remember being really excited to watch them when they first came out and when I started to watch the new ones from the last few years, that sense of excitement returned full force! So it's on that note that I, and my movie theatre-working friend who's now seen this one several times, really enjoyed this-the latest one which explores Han Solo's pre-Star Wars: A New Hope persona and explores his initial meeting with Chewbacca, Lando Calrissian, and the Millennium Falcon. As well as his working under a mentor who gives him the ropes and having a girlfriend named Qi'ra. Former child actor-turned successful director Ron Howard does a good enough job of continuing with the Star Wars entries so on that note, me and my friend highly recommend Solo: A Star Wars Story.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

It's 2018, people. It's time to just get with the times.I went in expecting to not enjoy myself at all and after the aforementioned slow start, I had a blast. Again - I've been a fan of Star Wars since I was a kid. I'm predispositioned to like films like this, just as Becca is usually apt to ignore that they are even released. Take it from someone who bought a Ric Ollie figure at midnight before the first prequel was released: this isn't the best or worst in the Saga. But it's pretty entertaining. Does every film have to be a religious experience? Or maybe there are too many of these films every year after decades of nothing.

14,michaelRokeefe,Not thrilled with first visit,6,27 May 2018,"Let me start by saying that director Ron Howard did the best he could with what the writers Jon and Lawrence Kasden presented him. Not that I entered the theater with a bad attitude, but I kept wondering if this was a legit Star Wars movie or someone in the galaxy trying to grab some quick cash. A young Han Solo (Alden Ehrenreich) and his girlfriend, Qi'ra (Emilia Clarke), are escaped slaves and the charming Han vows to come back for her after she is captured. Han tries to join the Imperial Army to become a pilot, but his lack of taking commands leaves him with the criminal element in general. He meets Tobias Beckett (Woody Harrelson) , who has his own gang needing a flyer. Even Beckett doesn't want Han Solo, who gets thrown in a lockup with a beast named Chewbacca (Joonas Suotama). The two manage a bond and do end up working in the criminal underworld with Beckett. Solo must earn enough money to buy his own ship to return for Qi'ra. Nothing real outstanding with the F/X, although the sound is edited well. Many characters are introduced that I couldn't care less about. A couple times I actually felt a bit board. The movie was closing in on the two hour mark and Ehrenreich began to please me. I don't have any idea where the real die-hard Star Wars fans will place this among all other that comes from that galaxy far, far away.Also featured in the cast: Paul Bettany, Donald Glover, Thandie Newton, Phoebe Waller-Bridge, David Chapman, Charlotte Louise, Warwick Davis and Clint Howard.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

17,hitchcockthelegend,Let me give you some advice. Assume everyone will betray you. And you will never be disappointed.,8,28 July 2019,"So the latest in what is becoming a long running sci-fi franchise sees Han Solo (Alden Ehrenreich) get his prequel movie. Unsurprisingly, such is the ferocious core fan base of the Star Wars series, it has been met with a mixture of outright hatred to pats on the back appreciation. It really is a case here of jumping in to view it on its own terms to at least give it a chance. The truth is, is that if this was a stand alone movie being judged purely as a science fiction action movie, then it would be better appreciated. For this is cracker jack entertainment in that sphere, with superbly constructed worlds inhabited by delirious looking aliens species, feisty droids hold court, and the humans are daring, cheeky and even sexy. It is in short quality and fantastical sci-fi, even if in truth as per the Solo character trajectory it's safe film making.We, as in the royal Star Wars fans we, all have our card carrying belief that our opinion on any Star Wars film is correct, but really the only advice I can honestly give here is that if you haven't seen it yet then at least give it a chance. Those that have seen it have their minds made up either way, so personally I can only say how much fun I had watching it - twice! All the dots are joined towards the Solo character I love so dear, from back when with childhood eyes in the late 70s I was transfixed on that big screen. How great to see how Han met Chewbacca (Joonas Suotamo) and how their brilliant friendship begins. To witness the birth of the Han/Lando Calrissian (Donald Glover excellent) friendly rivalry - and all that that entails as regards our favourite spaceship - The Millennium Falcon.

18,CinemaSerf,"A great fun action adventure from a galaxy far, far away....",8,9 February 2020,"I enjoyed this ""Star Wars"" spin off more than I enjoyed any of the middle trilogy of main-theme films. Alden Ehrenreich manages to capture some of the je ne sais pas of Harrison Ford's character in this Ron Howard effort. The escapades start straight from the beginning, and as you'd expect from this branch of the story - we have less philosophising and more blaster action. We learn just how he and ""Chewie"" acquired the ""Millennium Falcon"" and became first rate smugglers. Donald Glover is super as a young ""Lando Calrissian"" - you could easily see him morphing into Billy Dee Williams in later life. I'm afraid that I couldn't get my head around Paul Bettany as ""Dryden Vos""; he just didn't have any menace about him but all in all this is a cracking little sci-fi fantasy adventure.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
19,zardoz-13,"The Force Is Asleep in ""Solo""",1,2 June 2018,"""Apollo 13"" director Ron Howard's ""Solo, A Star Wars Story"" qualifies as an exercise in trivial pursuit rather than a sensational space odyssey in the thriving ""Star Wars"" franchise.

Mind you, ""The Force Awakens"" featured captivating characters with far more impressive pyrotechnics than ""Solo."" Happily, the second ""Star Wars Story"" is neither as bombastic nor as pretentious as the execrable ""Last Jedi."" Unfortunately, ""Solo"" suffers from the problems afflicting prequels. Since we know none of the franchise leads--Han Solo, Chewbacca, and Lando Calrissian--can die, the filmmakers generate only half as much suspense. The ill-fated characters that perish exert little impact in the greater context of events. Apart from prequel-itis, ""Empire Strikes Back"" scenarist Lawrence Kasdan and son Jonathan squander more time on penny-ante trivia about the eponymous character instead of fashioning a genuine, white-knuckled, escapade that might have propelled the franchise to greater heights. A mediocre B-movie, ""Solo"" is a routine crime thriller set among the stars. The best scene involves an elaborate but nerve-racking, roller-coaster train heist on a prodigious mountainside. Everything else seems superficial. At least one scene resembled the dudgeon scene in ""Return of the Jedi."" The aerial combat scenes with the Tie Fighters attacking the Falcon conjure up fewer thrills than the initial stand-off in the original ""Star Wars."" Han's adversaries project minimal menace. They fold like accordions in our hero's hands. Worse, they don't die spectacular deaths. You'll neither find a diabolical Darth Vader nor an arrogant Orson Krennic lurking in the background. A campy gargantuan octopus in outer space with teeth makes the depiction of the Kessel Run appear ludicrous rather than legendary. 
 
Basically, ""Solo, A Star Wars Story"" amounts to a laundry list of trivia serving as dots to connect the humdrum plot. Evidently, the people at Lucasfilm, Walt Disney Features, Imagine Entertainment, and Allison Shearmur Productions thought that depriving the title character of any shred of mystery would be indispensable for ""Star Wars"" aficionados. Why the Kasdans couldn't have made Han Solo into a livelier fellow still eludes me. ""Solo: A Star Wars Story"" never really gets under Han's skin, and the script seems intent on filling in the blanks of the Harrison Ford character as reincarnated by a different actor. Han Solo's younger version (Alden Ehrenreich of ""Heil, Caesar"") bears little resemblance to his lanky predecessor. Appropriately, he is an optimistic soul who hasn't attained the wisdom that years of hardship would later impart. Strutting about like Billy the Kid, Ehrenreich smiles too often to be taken seriously. Of course, everybody is bound to appreciate the irony when he utters the line: ""I've got a good feeling about this."" If the film establishes anything, it is Han's naivety. He spends the entire movie fooling himself that he isn't the good guy, even when his passing love interest observes that he isn't a good guy. Arguably, the most controversial aspect that ""Star Wars"" purists will clamor about concerns Han's precipitant action in the final showdown with Beckett. For years, Lucas waffled about Han's clash with Greedo in the Mos Eisley Cantina. After altering it for the 1997 Special Edition re-release of ""Star Wars,"" he turned around and changed it again no less than twice. This minutia is the single thing that distinguishes this otherwise the somnolent saga.
 
Nevertheless, the filmmakers address a number of questions any ""Star Wars"" fan would love to know. Indeed, we learn how Han acquired not only his surname, but also won the Millennium Falcon while gambling with duplicitous Lando Calrissian during a game of Sabacc. Furthermore, we learn the circumstances of Han's chance encounter in a prison cell with Chewbacca. While most of the film sticks to the original details that have been part and parcel of the ""Star Wars"" film franchise as well as the Extended Universe of the ""Star Wars"" spin-off novels, Howard and the Kasdans have altered those circumstances for dramatic purposes. Originally, Han had been an Empire officer who had intervened on behalf of Chewbacca while a fellow Empire officer was torturing the Wookie. In ""Solo,"" the two are thrown together unceremoniously as prisoners in an oubliette, a prison that can only be accessed by a trapdoor in the ceiling. Nowhere in the film do the filmmakers account for Han's ability to converse with Chewbacca in the Wookie's own language. An important character, Tobias Beckett (Woody Harrelson of ""Natural Born Killers""), exists as a mentor who recruits Han into the big league of crime. Beckett furnishes Han with his distinctive firearm, a blaster pistol with a scope on it. A career criminal who refuses to trust anybody, Beckett wields probably the greatest influence over our protagonist. Earlier, we were told about the oppressive ""Oliver Twist"" like conditions that governed his formative years as a juvenile delinquent on the ship-building planet Corellia. Later, the details of the Kessel Run are fleshed out, but the schlocky space octopus sabotages any thrills. Remember, you cannot have suspense when you already know the outcome. 
 
Apart from a tremendous train heist, ""Solo"" delivers little nail-biting, edge-of-the-seat, tension despite its lavish $250-million budget. When you consider how long ""Star Wars"" fans have awaited such an opportunity, it is hopelessly disheartening to have a film that winds up being such a superficial, sophomoric saga. The problems that Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy encountered after she fired original co-directors Phil Lord and Christopher Miller of ""The Lego Movie,"" replacing them with Oscar winning helmer Ron Howard, who restaged three-quarters of the movie, undoubtedly must have exacted a dire toll on the film. Moreover, ""Solo"" amounts to the least picturesque entry in the franchise with some of the drabbest cinematography. Entire scenes have been photographed in sepia, so that faces, costumes, uniforms, and technology appear washed out against shimmering white backgrounds. Indisputably, ""Solo, A Star Wars Story,"" lacks the force that made the classic ""Star Wars"" adventures entertaining.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

22,evanston_dad,Exceeded My Minimal Expectations,7,15 June 2018,"Chalk it up to extremely low expectations because I think Ron Howard is about the most pedestrian, boring director ever, but I really enjoyed ""Solo: A Star Wars Story"" as the minor diversion that it is.I'm a huge ""Star Wars"" fan, but I'm not slavishly devoted to the canon, and I'm fine with folks taking the series in new and different directions. (I liked a lot of what Rian Johnson did with ""The Last Jedi"" for example). But anyone taking on a Han Solo origin story has to realize that he's one of the most iconic characters in sci-fi fantasy history, played by one of the most iconic actors in the business. So you're setting yourself up for failure from the start, even in the eyes of those who aren't die-hard devotees. Alden Ehrenreich is moderately likable, but he doesn't come close to capturing the charisma Harrison Ford brought to the character. In fact, he plays him as kind of a dim bulb, when Solo was anything but. However, the movie itself is full of some satisfying set pieces, and it ticks off enough origin story boxes (Han meets Chewie, Han meets Lando, Han wins the Millenium Falcon) to keep fans of the original movies happy. ""Solo"" doesn't have a lot of re-watch appeal, certainly no where near as much as the only other stand-alone movie to date, ""Rogue One."" Mostly that's because the filmmakers made the mistake of not making ""Solo"" a stand-alone film. They end the movie with a hook suggesting a sequel and bring in characters and plot devices to tie this film into the bigger ""Star Wars"" saga, a mistake in my opinion, and especially now that the film has fared so badly at the box office that the chances of a sequel seem pretty slim.But the film is not as bad as some fan reaction and its lackluster box office might suggest, and there are worse ways to spend a couple of hours of your time. I'd rather sit through a mediocre ""Star Wars"" movie than a Marvel superhero movie any day.Grade: B+",Solo - A Star Wars Story
23,ferguson-6,filling in some blanks,6,24 May 2018,"Greetings again from the darkness. The second feature film directed by STAR WARS creator George Lucas was AMERICAN GRAFFITI in 1973. It starred a fresh-faced 19 year-old (mostly) TV actor named Ron Howard. Now 45 years later, Mr. Howard directs a prequel in the STAR WARS universe designed to fill in the gaps on the background of the beloved iconic character Han Solo - a role made famous, of course, by Harrison Ford. Alden Ehrenreich stars as young Han Solo, and like most everything in this film, he is fine. Some will recognize Mr. Ehrenreich from his two starring roles in 2016 - the Coen Brothers 2016 film HAIL, CAESAR! and Warren Beatty's RULES DON'T APPLY. He was also fine in both of those. His boyish Han Solo is wide-eyed and already sarcastic, though the familiar grizzled cynicism of Ford's version has yet to emerge. Since the film's purpose is to fill in the gaps, here is what we learn (the questions only, no answers provided here):
What did Han do before the Rebellion?
How exactly did he win the (shiny) Millennium Falcon in a card game?
What is the origin of his name?
How did he first become linked with Chewbacca?
How strong are Wookies?
How exactly did he make the Kessel run in less than 12 parsecs?
Each of these questions is answered in the film, and of course will not revealed hereWhen we first meet Han, he is basically a Juvenile Delinquent plotting an indentured labor escape with his girlfriend Qi'ra (played by Emilia Clarke, who is fine). Qi'ra evolves the most of any character in the film, but it's still just fine, not surprising or revolutionary. The film starts slowly but there is a minor spark once Han meets rebels Beckett (Wordy Harrelson) and Val (Thandie Newton). What follows is an extravagant and jaw-dropping train heist - the kickoff of many set pieces of which the filmmakers are quite proud and eager to show off.The supporting cast consists of Joonas Suotamo (taking over for Peter Mayhew who is physically unable to play the role) as Chewbacca, rising star Phoebe Waller-Bridge as L3-37, and Paul Bettany as bad guy Dryden Vos. There is also voice work from Jon Favreau and Linda Hunt, and quick but fun scenes with Warwick Davis (STAR WARS regular beginning with 1983 Return of the Jedi) and of course, Ron Howard's good luck charm, his brother Clint Howard. The real gem of the film is Donald Glover as Lando Calrissian - a less than honorable gambler in the game of Sabacc.The film is co-written by the father-son team of Jonathan Kasdan and Lawrence Kasdan. Given the pre-production issues - original directors Phil Lord and Christopher Miller were let go over ""creative differences"" - the film stands just fine on its own. The timelines will likely be debated by STAR WARS aficionados, but the fun action sequences and dazzling special effects make it entertaining enough after that slow start.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
24,morrison-dylan-fan,The solo album.,6,25 September 2020,"Getting home after seeing the incredible
Joel (2018-also reviewed) at the 26th Manchester Viva! Spanish & Latin American Festival 2020,I felt like viewing a easy-going flick before bed. Only knowing the title for how it did at the box office,I got set to play some solo tracks.View on the film:Having shown with In the Heart of the Sea (2015-also reviewed) a ability to cleanly film in free from daylight locations, director Ron Howard & cinematographer Bradford Young attempt to give Star Wars a Western grit, but misfire by covering the screen in thick smog, which terribly takes the shine off the Adventure atmosphere, thanks to the faces of the cast being partly obscured when in underground crime dens.Whilst not helped by John Powell's plodding score, Ron Howard bring the sparks of classic Hollywood across the galaxy in thrilling set-pieces, gliding in slick tracking shots breathlessly keeping up with Solo performing a train-style heist on a frozen mountain edge,and soaring to a break-neck Sci-Fi Adventure atmosphere from lively whip-pans on the combat stand-off between Solo's mob and a rival gang.Coming out of the wreckage from a extremely troubled production, the screenplay by the Kasdan's impressively holds the ship steady, with references to the mythology of Star Wars refreshingly being placed in the background,to allow a emphasis on a heist adventure,which happens to be set within the wider Star Wars universe.Entering the universe solo, the Kasdan's playfully set-up Han's future relationships with a wonderful gambling match with Lando,and a strong bond with fellow outlaw Chewbacca, all of which powers up the double-dealings and sleight of hand tricks in a chase to get hold of the bounty.Reuniting with Ron Howard after The Da Vinci Code (2006),Paul Bettany gives a tasty snarling turn as boo-hiss baddie Vos,whilst Alden Ehrenreich hints at the cocky confidence Han would later have. Stealing not only the ship,but the film itself, Donald Glover gives a mesmerising turn as Lando,thanks to Glover having him swagger with a chic Blaxploitation cool,in the fight to free solo.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
25,Wizard-8,A long time ago in a mediocre galaxy,5,18 October 2018,"There has been a lot of talk trying to figure out why ""Solo: A Star Wars Story"" underperformed at the box offices. Among the theories brought up are the fact it was released only a short time after a previous ""Star Wars"" movie (""The Last Jedi""), the fact that ""The Last Jedi"" disappointed many moviegoers, and the fact that ""Solo"" was released during a time of heavy competition from other blockbusters.While I do think those (and other) reasons did hurt the box office take to a significant degree, I thought while watching the movie a new reason not discussed by anyone else before. It took me a while to pin down what I think a big mistake the filmmakers made while making the movie, but eventually I realized that there is very little feeling of urgency and struggle in the movie. In the original three ""Star Wars"" movies, the characters were fighting for their lives. Here, you get the feeling of people being mildly inconvenienced. As a result, I didn't really get into what was happening. Sure, there are action scenes (though the action is curiously gone in the movie's climax), but it all feels by the numbers and quite tired.There are a few good things to be found in the movie, ranging from a few instances of amusing comic relief to a good performance by Donald Glover as Lando. But as a whole, the movie simply isn't a grabber, and comes across more like uninspired product than a thrilling adventure. The biggest kindness I can give the movie is by saying it's not as bad as ""The Last Jedi"".",Solo - A Star Wars Story

A quality start with good character introductions, escaping that place, being thrown into the pit for Chewbacca, joining up with Beckett and crew, but it ultimately goes nowhere. The plot's irrelevant, other than Han having met Chewy and Lando and now having his own ship. Emilia Clarke's just in everything now? I had this conversation with someone about her in the Terminator film, they thought she didn't fit the role, like she was just there and I thought she embodied that role of Sarah Connor well. Here though, I feel as they had. Also, what's with the chance meeting with Han, a bit far fetched. I don't see the point in the game thing, if we don't see or know what's going on.

That was super and it did had the Star Wars feeling due baby Yoda.Here we do have Han and Chewie but that's it. Just a story how they became friends and how the Millenium Falcon came in Han's hands.

29,deloudelouvain,"Better CGI's than in the previous ones, but story of the same quality.",8,6 April 2020,"After so many years of postponing I finally decided to watch all the Star Wars movies. Since there are different ways to watch it I'm going for the chronological order and not the release date order, that just makes more sense to me. Maybe I watched a couple movies when I was young, I probably did, but I don't remember anything about it so to me it's all new and maybe one day I will understand the whole hype about the Star Wars saga. After watching The Phantom Menace, Attack Of The Clones and Revenge Of The Sith it's now time for Solo: A Star Wars Story. Again I thought the story was more than okay, very enjoyable, so again no complaint from me here. By watching the saga in chronological order you appreciate every movie better than in order by release date. In this case it's an introduction to a new character: Han Solo, which will become an important character in the next movies. It's just a better way to watch the whole saga, it's much easier to follow and for somebody new to it like me it's just much more appealing. The best thing about this movie and probably all the others are the different characters, races of aliens, and the different spaceships and weapons, I just love it. The CGI's are better than in the earlier movies, what makes perfect sense as the technology is just better now. I can't wait to watch the next one, will probably binge watch the eleven movies and will probably squeeze The Mandalorian between it, as long as the chronological order is respected. This was the fourth movie of eleven in barely 48 hours for me, today I'll watch Rogue One and A New Hope in the hope the quality stays the same, looking forward to it.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

If cinematic junk food is what you're after, this delivers. *SPOILERS* *SPOILERS* *SPOILERS*It's when you walk out of the theater and begin the digestion process that things get dicey.

31,SimonJack,Very good sequel-prequel of Star Wars,8,7 June 2018,"This is a very entertaining and good story in the Star Wars tradition. Alden Ehrenreich is a very good match for a young Han Solo. He shows the early characteristics of the rebellious nature of the character that George Lucas introduced to us in the first of the Star Wars films. He could be a young Harrison Ford, especially in his cockiness and daredevil ways. Ehrenreich is noticeably short in height compared to Ford (5-9 vs 6-1), and it takes a little getting used to. But he makes up for that in his frequent cocky and menacing smile. Ford's Han Solo maybe cracked half a smile once or twice in each of his films. I'm not knocking that, but in the search for a new actor to play the young character these years later, the smug smiles come across nicely.""Solo: A Star Wars Story"" has the fixtures that distinguish this wonderful series in the science-fiction realm. First of all, it's set in space. Second, it has a delightful menagerie of creatures from around the universe. Third, it has the imaginative types of space ships and travel. Fourth, it has interstellar travel with different planets. Fifth, it has the mysterious menaces of space, in this case a monstrous space octopus. And, it has space chases, battles, ogres, plain and mysterious bad guys, and more. This anthology film (meaning, outside the original saga set of six), has its own interesting facets. One finally sees how Han Solo won the Millennium Falcon from Lando Calrissian in a card game. One discovers that Solo didn't have any family and didn't know who his parents might have been. He grew up on a planet where he and other orphans had to steal to eat and survive. And, one learns how he came to have his last name, Solo. I'll take these imaginative, space sci-fi films any day over other varieties. They probe the depths of possibilities from the great expanse of space with all its mysteries and unknown aspects. This is real sci-fi. Others can have the comic book creatures with their same old slam-bang-crash-smash full throttle action CGI and special effects. Those plotless products apparently have some use in supplying people who need constant adrenalin rushes. Give me the fun and exciting adventures of Star Wars and other space sci-fi thrillers any day.

I mean, at the beginning I couldn't see any resemblance between Alden Ehrenreich and the Han Solo I knew, but at the end... I started seeing it a little.What I didn't like was everything else. The story made no sense, the details made no sense, the fighting made no sense, the bombastic speeches and the pointless posturing made no sense. In fact, this is a typical heist movie, set in space, with a lot of mambo jumbo thrown in so you can feel scifi-ish about it. We've seen it before and that's why, for me, it would have been a failure. But it was not because it was very well done.Bottom line: if you enjoy Star Wars it's probably because you've learned to ignore all inconsistencies, big and small, and all things that make little sense. It's a fairy tale, right? Logic be damned. Technology be damned. Physics be damned. It's all about ""find me on Earth, ask about Siderite"" and that somehow working. Then you will like this film. If you are looking for something that doesn't look like an old war movie about Nazi soldiers who are half blind and totally deaf being outmatched by charismatic American scoundrels, then you won't like it.

If you go into this looking for a clever script that starts into Solo's background, you will find this one makes sense. If your looking for Han Solo as a child, nope, it does not go that far. Here are some of the revelations-This one tells how Han got his last name, yet does not reveal what his real last name is (of course no, Solo was not stolen from The Man From Uncle?). It tells how Han Solo first meets Lando Parisan, and of course Chewbacca. It points out that Lando originally owned the Milennium Falcon, and loses the ship to Han. The scandal here is Han Solo's girl he loves here (prior to Luke's Sister Leia) is a married woman. Solo being in love with a woman committed to another is a new angle to his story. While the directing of Ron Howard makes this a good film it is definite that this might be the weakest film in the series to date. It does play to be sequeled There is a bridge from here to episode 4 that would need to be made. I get the feeling that might be the plan. I have been trying to think of how a spoiler could screw up this sequence and tie the Solo story to episode 1? My idea though it has flaws would be to reveal that Han Solo has another affair on the way to Episode 4, stopping off before episode 1 and having an affair with Anakins mother fathering the child who will become Darth Vadar. Leave it to me as this would make Solo the Dr. Frankenstein of this film series. Like I said, this has flaws. Am I trying to bring dead tissue to life?

What is more alarming and incredible is SOLO's offshore fiasco (stateside $213 million plus $ 180 million in international market, presumably, it needs at least $500 million to break even its costly price tag), particularly with a puny $10.1 million revenue in China, it is an abysmal number for any blockbuster in this world's second-biggest ticket-buying trade, how the hell could that happen? Assessing it individually, SOLO is an above-average heist film leverages all the chills and thrills through its pyrrhic victories (a train-top raid, an intergalactic voyage, and a slave revolt that not so amusingly sends up the zealous droid L3-37, voiced by Phoebe Waller-Bridge), and the climax plays up the gamesmanship between Solo (Ehrenreich), his mentor Tobias Beckett (Harrelson), his reunited girlfriend Qi'ra (Clarke) and the evil crime lord Dryden Vos (Bettany), with some expecited if sophomoric twists.Solo is a bumptious, macho whippersnapper but as Qi'ra correctly notifies, he is a good man underneath, even good to a fault of nondescript (apart from his aircraft maneuvering faculty and a talent for Wookiee tongue), harboring a resolution to save Qi'ra, who is left behind during the opening escaping escapade, but, when later they finally reunite, he cannot suss out the fact that she is not a damsel-in-distress waiting for her knight-in-the-shining-armor in the first place, yet still hopes for rekindle their romance while he doesn't bother to find out what has happened to her, even considering she claims there is no time for that during their hectic schedule, but why not squeeze some time for harmless canoodling?When Qi'ra reveals her ulterior motive, which sensibly, is not a betrayal but a simple fact, the girl outgrows the boy during their lost three years, she still loves him, but she becomes the girl that gets away, the plot is fairly acceptable, but feels old-fashioned in its boys-will-be-boys chivalry (even the film considerably allots more focus on Qi'ra's vacillating mentation), very 70s, that style is right in the wheelhouse of Howard and co-writer Lawrence Kasdan, but this sort of sign of the times fails to connect with new audience, Solo is too cock-a-hoop to emerge as a true hero under the circumstances, he needs a learning curve, but what Howard and his teams have achieved feels short-changed, albeit a diligent Ehrenreich tries his best to emulate Harrison Ford's nonchalant coolness, he is neither the savior nor the scourge for this missed opportunity, there is only that much an actor could do in a jinxed enterprise. Sprinkling vintage connections into the story to engage STAR WAR devotees, like the ritualistic first glimpse of the Millennium Falcon, the friend-or-foe chemistry between Han and Lando Calrissian (Glover, sports an effervescent persona suffused with guile and alacrity, even briskly knuckles down for an whopping human-droid affection that certainly can knock one's socks off), the provenance of Solo's ""shoots first"" second nature and even a cameo from Darth Maul himself. But just like in the coda, Lando has his card stolen in his sleeve, the film also misses a trump card to turn this one-off side-dish to a proper main course on the table.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
37,Hellmant,I really wish Disney hadn't fired Phil Lord and Christopher Miller!,8,25 May 2018,"'SOLO: A STAR WARS STORY': Four Stars (Out of Five)The second of the stand-alone 'STAR WARS' anthology films (following 2016's 'ROGUE ONE'), about the early adventures of a younger Han Solo, as he meets Chewbacca and Lando Calrissian. The movie was directed by Ron Howard (who also helmed another George Lucas universe film, 'WILLOW'), and it was scripted by Lawrence Kasdan (a veteran 'STAR WARS' writer) and his son Jonathan. It stars Alden Ehrenreich (as Han Solo), Woody Harrelson, Emilia Clarke, Donald Glover, Joonas Suotamo, Paul Bettany, Thandie Newton and Phoebe Waller-Bridge. The movie has received mostly positive reviews from critics, and it's expected to break all kinds of records at the Box Office as well. Being a huge 'STAR WARS' fan, I was really disappointed with this movie. The story begins with Han (Ehrenreich) as a young smuggler, who desperately wants to start a new life for him and his lover, Qi'ra (Clarke). When he's separated from her, Han enlists in the Empire and becomes an expert pilot. He deserts his position and goes to work for a criminal named Tobias Beckett (Harrelson), with the hopes of making enough money to get back to Qi'ra. Along the way Han also meets Chewbacca (Suotamo) and Lando Calrissian (Glover), and he's also given the last name Solo. The film for me is the worst of all the new 'STAR WARS' reboot movies (at the least), it also feels the least like a true 'STAR WARS' film. That's definitely not to say that it's a bad movie at all. The action scenes are decent, and the performances are adequate; although I don't think Ehrenreich resembles what a young Han Solo should be at all (he's a good actor in other movies though, and I think he can be charismatic in the right role). I had hoped for so much more from a Han Solo origins story, that I can only possibly feel severely disappointed with what I got. I also don't think Howard can direct a quality film anymore (he hasn't in a long time). I really wish Disney hadn't fired the original directors of the movie too (Phil Lord and Christopher Miller); I think they could have delivered something much more magical, but now we'll never know.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
38,cherold,enjoyable in spite of uncharismatic leads and drab cinematography,7,8 October 2018,"I started enjoying Solo a little more after I changed my TV display setting to vivid, so perhaps I would have enjoyed the movie more had I done that from the beginning. But I've never watched a movie whose color palette was so muted that my enjoyment was contingent on the TV's settings.While I enjoyed Solo overall, it's lack of vividness goes beyond cinematography. Neither Alden Ehrenreich nor Danny Glover have the glittering star power of Harrison Ford and Billy Dee Williams. Only Woody Harrelson as a criminal radiates strong personality.The story is pretty good and moves well and there is a nice mix of humor and action. Some critics complained the movie played it too safe, but I don't expect Star Wars movies to go all avant garde so it seems like a weird complaint. Yes, it plays it safer than The Last Jedi, and is less interesting, but it falls solidly in the standard Star Wars safety parameters with most of the other movies.Ultimately, Solo is a fun little movie that falls short of the epic status it is aiming for. I'd recommend watching it, but if you do so on TV, play with your settings first.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

40,Pjtaylor-96-138044,"It's nothing special, but it's entertaining enough.",6,9 June 2018,"Is it a masterpiece? No. Is it even necessary? Not really. However, 'Solo: A Star Wars Story (2018)' is easily the most enjoyable of the new 'Star Wars' sequels and spin-offs and that, and that alone, makes it perhaps my favourite. Let me be clear here, I don't think this is a great film. It isn't even solid from a technical stand-point, being messy story-wise and seeming mishandled compared to what 'could have been'. This new 'universe' is still somehow in its infancy, though, and this blatantly unnecessary entry actually seems more justified every time an announcement is made detailing an upcoming picture about the most inconsequential of characters or situations. Yet, there's still a sense that the bar has been lowered significantly. This is actually through necessity, due to disappointment after disappointment which all make you question the integrity of the brand, and not just because of this picture as it is, as I mentioned, possibly the best of the new bunch. It is enjoyable enough and that alone is what's been missing, for me at least, from the recent entries in this franchise. By no means is it perfect, or even close to being great, but there's a sense of entertainment that is refreshing given both my prior hesitations about its prospects and the well-documented behind-the-scenes turbulence. The production woes didn't actually seem to effect the flick all that noticeably, as you can't really tell where Lord and Miller end and Howard begins, at least not without scrutiny. It does seem like we got a different, 'safer' film than initially intended, though, and that is a shame. There's no way of telling if the original direction would have provided a better final result, though. Nor is there any way to tell which beats belong to which director, successful or not so. Key to the flick's limited success is its eventual ability to ease you back into your seat, to be content that these are the characters (albeit essentially new ones) we should root for and to just enjoy the ride while we do. As I said, the bar sort of lowers as you're watching, but it becomes the safety-bar of a mildly exciting roller-coaster as you're strapped in and it sets off without you really noticing. Most of the major issues revolve around its connections to the other pictures in its cannon, which are clumsy and haphazard. Most of the tie-ins are so unnecessary that they are almost insulting, like explaining that Han calls Chewbacca by a nickname because he finds his full name too long to say. Others literally seem like they were written as parodies (see the much-maligned name-giving scene) but were put into the movie by someone who just didn't get the joke. There's also an issue with the characters not really having arcs. Some of them do come and go so quickly they don't have time to make an impact. This is less excusable with our hero, though. Han isn't given the arc you'd expect and he isn't given the subversive one that you perhaps wouldn't, either. He just kind of meanders about, more concerned with morals than money, because the writers know where he needs to end up, internally, in order to appear in that Cantina but they also have the benefit of knowing his full arc. It seems like they don't want to make him a scoundrel or a rogue or even a smuggler because that isn't 'hero' material, but it is necessary because that's how he is in 'Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope (1977)'. The treatment of his character here undermines his arc in the original trilogy. This is true of a lot of the tie-in stuff, it undermines the thing it tries to tie in to. The other issues that persist - such as a poor pace, some iffy scripting and a few dodgy sequel-baits (that are based in the past in an irritating and kind of unnecessary way) - are never so detrimental as to detract from the rather consistent level of passive engagement felt. Much less can they properly annoy you, instead eliciting a resigned sigh and roll of the eyes at most. It's probably not a good thing that the passion to care about the picture's missteps can't even be stirred, that it sucks even that energy from you, and, yet, it is enjoyable to watch. I would equate it to fast-food. It's fine, even tasty, while you eat it but quickly forgettable and ultimately unfulfilling. It works better as a stand-alone, as the franchise elements are the ones that fall down upon further inspection. The more I think about this film, the less I like it. It was genuinely entertaining, to an extent, while I watched it, though. There are a lot of poorly conceived elements it has to navigate around and hurdles it has to jump, but it comes out relatively unscathed on the initial, irreverent 'fun-factor' side of things. It was much better than I anticipated, in this regard. Perhaps on a second watch, it will all fall apart. For now, the fact I found it enjoyable outweighs the problems with its plot. I didn't think it was great, but I thought it was decent. Perhaps, however, that's because my expectations were so low. 6/10",Solo - A Star Wars Story
41,ThomasDrufke,"""You will learn how Han Solo gets his name"" - Why?",4,5 June 2018,"In this world of insane reshoots, controversial casting choices, unoriginal story ideas, and a shockingly divisive The Last Jedi, Solo was pretty much releasing in a lose-lose situation. It felt like this film was either going to reinvigorate half the Star Wars fan-base because of The Last Jedi's backlash, or it was going to crash and burn. And by the looks of the box office, this film is doing the ladder.I went in with little to no expectations, and came out of it feeling like there was absolutely no need to make this film. I'm not going to lose sleep over the quality of Solo, considering I hardly expected the film to be good however, I did feel a little bit angry that this film even existed. How can they possibly make a film about one of the coolest characters in film history feel inconsequential? Dull? And just downright boring? The idea of prequels has always bugged me, but if it's either far enough in the past or there's a legit enough storyline, then I'm all for them. But how exactly are we supposed to care about a young Han Solo movie if we have already seen a young Han Solo on screen in one of the greatest trilogies of all time?As I said, it's a near impossible feat to overcome, especially when you also factor in a new love interest, not named Leia, that we are supposed to care about. The reality is that Emilia Clarke plays Qi'ra beautifully and for the most part, the movie is very well acted. The real problems lie with the Kasdan's script. There were rumors awhile back that this was supposed to be ""the best Star Wars script"", but it's far from it. A Meandering plot without an antagonist threat that makes his or her presence felt, won't get you very far. A hero is only as good as its villain and vice versa. Again, the performances and actors did quite well, but I could care less about any of the characters when the script never gives you a reason to.How Han ""gets his last name"" is one of the most truly cringe worthy moments of the saga, L3 is an abomination of a character, Enfys Nest is incredibly underdeveloped and out of nowhere, there's a laughable cameo, and the script thinks it's far more clever than it actually is. All this makes for an un-enjoyable complete mess of a film. Better re-think those plans Kathleen Kennedy.4.3/10",Solo - A Star Wars Story
42,Cineanalyst,Predictable,4,14 January 2019,"One of the plot points of ""Solo,"" the second of Disney's stand-alone Star Wars prequels after ""Rogue One"" (2016), is how predictable people are. Fittingly, I suppose, the movie itself is likewise predictable, as well as a mostly listless affair, with the exception of some genuine excitement once young Han gets behind the wheel of the Millennium Falcon. Just about everything else, however, comes off as rather tedious. Ron Howard tends to be such a paint-by-numbers hack of a movie-maker, and this outing is no exception. Perhaps, his best work was when he was able to sustain the kind of tension seen here aboard the Millennium Falcon sequence for the entirety of ""Apollo 13"" (1995). Once I saw his name attached to this Star Wars burger, I knew I was waiting for it to appear on Netflix rather than face disappointment at a theatre.The template for ""Solo,"" as much as the rest of the Star Wars franchise, is surely the Indian Jones series, which, of course, also starred Harrison Ford and included George Lucas behind the scenes. But, Howard is no Steven Spielberg. I don't even get the bit of critical acclaim given to Donald Glover here as Lando Calrissian, either. It seems to me that most of the actors were sleepwalking through their parts. Glover and Emilia Clarke have done better work on TV, and I doubt this iteration of Han Solo is going to launch the career of Alden Ehrenreich the way the part did for Ford. The acting is the least of the problems, though. Worse is how drab and derivative the picture is. This includes the gray and brown color scheme, which makes this the ugliest Star Wars picture to date.Then, there's the needless tropes, such as the campfire storytelling time, the piloting maneuver that will be repeated later, and, most overused of all, the unrequited romance. Moreover, the entire thing is an exercise in reliving past triumphs of the Star Wars franchise; the movie actually doesn't add any depth to the characters. How Han became a great pilot, or gambler, or gunslinger isn't investigated. As in the first ""Star Wars,"" he's just always been that way. Even his love interest this time is just a variation on the same dynamics with Princess Leia. Also thrown in are the usual Star Wars androids and robots varying from cutesy to sassy, a train sequence made with CGI that nevertheless manages to copy ""Captain America: The First Avenger"" (2011) and a series of scheming and double-crossing. Contrary to the predictability of this formulaic flick, though, the audience--people, that is--are not always so predictable. Sometimes, they'll buck the expectations for yet another sub-par entry even if it's for one of the most beloved franchises in movie history, and so it flops.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

44,lesleyharris30,"Has it's Moments, but Never Truly Shines,",7,29 October 2018,"Solo: A Star Wars Story is a good movie with a reasonably well developed plot and a talented cast. I will certainly commend this film for being very fun, one of my issues with the most recent anthology film, The Last Jedi, was that it did not have enough of it. There are plenty of great back and forth moments, some nice rapid fire dialogue, it was just refreshing to see a film be playful with this universe again. A highlight for me is, without a doubt, Donald Glover as Lando, he lives and breaths the part, being perfectly suited as a young Billy Dee Williams. He was very slick, simply fun to watch, and I have high hopes we will get to see him in the part again.While it is no doubt entertaining, it is lacking in something that would have had me completely hooked, there was a sense of a lack of confidence in the overall film, it was shakey and lacking in charm because of that.I think the main reason I felt this way about the movie is, while he is by no means bad in it, Alden Ehrenreich just does not quite nail it as Han Solo. He was lacking in the charismatic selfishness of Harrison Ford, I always loved how the character was sort of an anti-hero, only out for himself, so it was underwhelming to see him be a lot more of a traditional hero here. As well as that, Ehrenreich is really only doing an impression of Ford, which I get that he had to do, but I never felt a moment of him doing his own thing with the character at all, it was a bit rigid. Fun while it lasts, but nothing spectacular.Playful, action packed, but forgettable, Star Wars fans should certainly check out Solo, but leave your expectations behind while watching.

Guys, you cannot expect new movies to be the same as ""Star Wars"" from 1977. It's been almost half a century since then and everything has changed. New writers, new directors, new actors, and new technologies simply can not be the same as the old ones. True, I too feel that Alden Ehrenreich as Han Solo could not hold a candle to Harrison Ford, but Ford is an old man now and he cannot play in Han Solo origins movie. Be honest and admit that the problem isn't in Alden and that your reaction would be the same whoever they took for the role of Han. Ron Howard is a good director, the film stars Emilia Clarke, Paul Bettany, Donal Glover, and the awesome Woody Harrelson, CGI is good, music is better, and action keeps you at the edge of the seat.

50,ironhorse_iv,I had a bad feeling about this. 'Solo' truly did turn out to be very meh.,7,5 June 2018,"This movie was not well made. No wonder, why this second Star Wars anthology film distributed by Walt Disney, flew a little low at the box office, compare to the franchise's first standalone film, 2016's 'Rogue One'. It really did a troublesome production, where, most of the movie had to be reshoot, due to creative differences between Lucasfilm president, Kathleen Kennedy and the original directors, Phil Lord & Christopher Miller. The conflict reportedly came from Lord and Miller's easy going time consuming style of directing; which often delay production; due to their wiliness for improvisation and taking multiply takes. Kennedy was also, very unhappy with the tone of the film; as the filmmakers were pushing for a more meta-like adventure comedy; while the president wanted a more grounded, gritty space-western with a flair of film noire. Eventually, the dispute became public and the project started to be plagued by negative press. It got so bad, that Lord and Miller were let go, and were ultimately replaced by Ron Howard. For the most start, Howard did salvage the project, from, getting shelf, however, the damage was already done. Since the movie had to be remade, quickly & released on a certain date, there wasn't enough time to market the film. Causing, the standalone film's first trailer being released, only 3 months, before it hit theaters. Sadly, the ugly-looking, pitch black, visual story of a young Han Solo (Aiden Ehrenreich) having to complete the Kessel Run didn't drum up a lot of interest with audiences, especially when another Star Wars film's 2017's 'Star Wars: Episode VIII: The Last Jedi' was still playing in some theaters just over a month before its release. It also doesn't help that 'the Last Jedi' was highly divisive among audiences; as people started to complain about 'Star Wars' fatigue. Added to that, like most spin-offs, the movie isn't strictly necessary, as most fans knew enough about the man in the original trilogy to understand his plight toward being a smuggler & his redemption toward doing something good. Some fans didn't felt like, yet another film show be introduce, to retell that. Even though Disney threw out pretty much every Star Wars comic and book that was written before they acquired Lucasfilm with the dish water. These fans are just not interested in getting onboard with the new 'canon' continuity of Star Wars; due to its confusing, rehash nature. The franchise felt a bit staled & prediction. Because of that, the paint by number movie couldn't combative stiff competition from compelling, progressive driven comic book movies such as Fox's 'Deadpool 2' and Marvel's 'Avengers: Infinity War', that is every-changing their approach in the ways, they use their own content. Without spoiling the movie written by Lawrence & Jonathan Kasdan, too much; the story set prior to the events of 1977's 'Star Wars: Episode IV: A New Hope' is all over the place. While, it fills the answers to several call forward unanswered questions; there is little structure. It jumps around, spilling redundant information dump, introducing interesting characters; only to be killed off before we have time to get attached, in a series of filler action sequences. It's only, when we get to the second part, that the movie starts to come together. However, that frame work fell back, apart, toward the climax; when the Cloud Riders are reintroduced. The film took too long to find, its footing. It was so badly paced. Another problem with the film is the acting. Ehrenreich landed the dubious task of trying to live up to Harrison Ford's iconic portrayal. Although some people have praised his performance; I didn't think, he quite lives up to his predecessor. While, he was indeed charming, Ehrenreich doesn't captures Ford's smirky, roguish charisma. He was so bad in, getting the mannerism, that apparently, an acting coach was call it on set to help him. While it was probably smart for the actor not to try to do a direct impression, his acting was still jarring to me. Ehrenreich just doesn't stick the landing. As for the supporting cast, Woody Harrelson is fine as Tobias Beckett, but unsurprising, he's playing a role, he play, way too many times before. So, it wasn't very unique. As for Emilia Clarke. She was alright, but her character was never sympathetic nor femme fatale enough to really work as Han's would-be flame Qi'ra. She was disappointing. Donald Glover as Lando Calrissian was not. He delivers. Glover captures the duplicity and bravado, very well. He even drop his voice about half an octave and enunciating words the same way, the original actor, Billy Dee Williams does. It was wonderful. I can't say the same with his droid copilot, L3-37 (Voiced by Phoebe Waller-Bridge). She was highly annoying with her SJW feminism style jokes. Very cringe-worthy. As for the main villain, Dryden Vos (Paul Bettany). Too generic-looking. Don't get me wrong, Paul Bettany is an immensely talented actor and very frighten in this role. However, his character doesn't stand out, much. At least, the original actor, Michael K. Williams's costume and make up is pretty out there. This looks small; but the fan service is even smaller. As much as I love Warwick Davis & Clint Howard cameos. I kinda wish, more familiar characters like Jabba the Hutt & Boba Fett. Also, not having R2-D2 and C3PO there, was such a letdown. They appeared in every Star Wars film to date. Solo brought the end to that streak and it sucks. As for the surprise cameo in the end. He was very jarring for those who hasn't watch any of the Star Wars animation series such as 'Star Wars: The Clone Wars' (2008-2015) and 'Star Wars: Rebels' (2014-2018). You'd have to watch a number of episodes from both series to get his whole story. In the end; while, this movie offers some pulpy fun. This film was no tour-de force. It's not a ride worth taking. At least, not in theaters.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
51,The-Sarkologist,A great introduction to a memorable character,9,28 May 2018,"It seems as if these 'Star Wars' stories are actually turning out to be of a much higher quality than the new trilogy. Then again, I suspect that it has a lot more to do with exploring the back stories as opposed to coming up with something new, which in reality there is nothing all that new about this so called 'new trilogy' in that it simply seems to be a complete rehash of the original trilogy aimed at a much younger audience. However, there seems to also be a movie on Disney's behalf to continue to develop the Star Wars universe, at least in the period that leads up to the original stories. In a way this makes a lot of sense since the prequel trilogy (which I didn't think was anywhere near as bad as some people believe) was Vader's back story, these films are exploring some of the other characters within the franchise.
 As you can pretty much tell by the title, this movie pretty much sets up the character of Han Solo, and for those interested, ends ten years prior to the start of the original trilogy, which gives the franchise an awful lot of scope in which to build on this particular character's back story. Anyway, this film tells us how he meets Chewie, how he made in Kessel run in 12 parsecs, and also how he managed to win the Millenium Falcon 'fair and square' in a card game. As such, we also have Lando Calrisian entering the fold, though it turned out that he is not as major a character as I expected him to be.
 I liked the film. It was a little slow to start but it really picked up once they were on their mission, and the ending, while reasonably conclusive, left the door wide open for a number of films to come. In fact they have introduced some new organisations on top of the Empire, which seems to sit in the background in many cases, and these organisations happen to be crime syndicates. I won't spoil anything by indicating who the power behind the throne actually is, but people who are familiar with The Clone Wars and Rebels probably already have a suspicion (though I suspect they have probably already seen the film).
 There was an interesting scene around the beginning, well a couple because we are introduced to one of the planets where the Imperial Ships are built, and it also happens to be a planet that is pretty much a den of thieves. This isn't all that surprising considering it is an industrial planet, and even if you are building ships, it's pretty hard to actually get off the planet. Solo manages to do so (and we also discover why he is called Han Solo, namely because he doesn't have a family), but in a round-a-bout way (particularly since his dream is to become an awesome space pilot).
 Then there is the scene in the Imperial Army when it is at war on a random planet. The official statement is that they are pacifying resistance, though Han sees right through that in that it is not so much resistance, but rather that they are invaders. However, it is also interesting to see that despite the rule of an iron fist, there is a lot of dodginess going on behind the scenes, and people impersonating Imperial Officers for their own gain.
 Oh, and we also discover why the Millenium Falcon has that little gap in the front, which wasn't something that I particularly wondered since I thought that it had something to do with the design. However, it turns out that when we first encounter the ship the gap isn't there. The other thing, is that the original trilogy is a story as much about the Millenium Falcon as it is about many of the other characters, and in a way is a character in and of itself. So, you could say that this is also a film that introduces us to the ship, though I suspect that this story may be held back until a possible Lando Carrisian movie that is in the rumour mill (though the next Star Wars story is apparently about Boba Fett).",Solo - A Star Wars Story

53,tomgillespie2002,"Entertaining adventure, but nothing worthy of the Star Wars banner",6,23 September 2018,"During the countless times I watched George Lucas' original Star Wars trilogy as a child, teenager and adult, I don't recall ever wondering how Han Solo became the sarcastic, smirking smuggler that definitely shot first. Ever since Disney acquired Lucasfilm and announced that not only would they be continuing the story that began back in 1977 but would also be giving some of the fan-favourite supporting characters their very own spin-offs, there's been a split in the fandom between those gagging for anything Star Wars related on the big screen again and those opposed to a project that would both render the many beloved novels set in the Star Wars universe as un-canon, and undermine the story already told. Rian Johnson's The Last Jedi is either loved or hated (I loved it), but the one announcement that brought all the fans together in united opposition was Han Solo's very own spin-off, which would be set in the past and not feature the man who helped make the character so iconic, Harrison Ford.You may not care just how Han won the Millennium Falcon from Lando Calrissian, or how he met Chewbacca, or how he got his hands on that cool blaster, or how he made the Kessel Run in under 12 parsecs - but Solo: A Star Wars Story is going to tell you anyway. While this isn't necessarily a bad thing, it does give Solo a sense of weightlessness and the feeling of a filler episode in the middle of television series with too many episodes. With such little stakes at play, the success of Solo comes down to the charm of its actors, and the casting of Alden Ehrenreich was a very shrewd move indeed. He isn't a famous name, or even a pronounceable one, but his scene-stealing performance in 2016's Hail, Caesar!, where he managed to overshadow the likes of George Clooney, Tilda Swinton, John Brolin and Ralph Fiennes, bristled with star quality. Harrison Ford could never be replaced and Ehrenreich seems to know that, so while every now and then you get a glimmer of Ford's smile and his iconic one-handed shooting stance, Ehrenreich makes the role his own, replicating the charisma and infusing it with a youthful innocence.We first meet Han hot-wiring cars on Corellia, an awful planet where orphaned children are forced to steal for slug-like gang-boss Lady Proxima (voiced by Linda Hunt). With their lives in danger from the local gangs, Han and his lady friend Qi'ra (Emilia Clarke) decide to make a break for it, but at the airport they are separated, with Han fleeing to join the Imperial Navy and Qi'ra taken away by her pursuers. Three years later, Han is serving in the Military after being kicked out of the Flight Academy, fighting as an infantryman on a planet called Mimban. There he encounters a gang of criminals posing as Imperial soldiers led by the enigmatic Tobias Beckett (Woody Harrelson) and attempts to blackmail them into letting him join them. Instead, he is thrown into a pit for desertion, where he meets the formidable Chewbacca (Joonas Suotamo). They escape and manage to convince Beckett to enlist them for a job to steal a shipment of coaxium. Now officially an outlaw, Han is brought into a dangerous world controlled by a criminal syndicate called Crimson Dawn. Beckett answers directly to crime boss Dryden Vos (Paul Bettany), whose favourite advisor is a young lieutenant named Qi'ra.Solo likely won't convince those soured by The Last Jedi or especially those who failed to see any potential in Han Solo origin movie in the first place, but it may be a nice, if forgettable, surprise for some. Like the other 'Star Wars Story', Rogue One, Solo was hit with numerous problems during production, the most notable being the firing of Phil Lord and Christopher Miller and the subsequent hiring of Ron Howard. Star Wars has always been a rule-bound universe, and Lord and Miller's loose, improvised style was perhaps too much for studio executives looking for a guaranteed hit. Howard was a reliable, safe choice, but one has to wonder how much fun Solo could have been in the hands of those responsible for 21 Jump Street and The LEGO Movie. What we have is a perfectly entertaining adventure movie that is surprisingly coherent given the patchwork built into it, but nothing worthy of the Star Wars banner. History will remember the film as the first Star Wars flop, and will cause historians to wonder why they didn't choose to given Donald Glover's Lando his own movie instead. On a positive note that will no doubt unite the fan-base, a box-office return of south of $400 million seem to have woken Disney executives up to the idea that there is such a thing as too much, too soon.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",Solo - A Star Wars Story
54,Thanos_Alfie,Nice story...,7,7 January 2019,"""Solo: A Star Wars Story"" is an Action - Sci-Fi movie and also a prequel of Star Wars in which we watch the story of Han Solo. While the demand for hyper fuel and other resources rising, Han Solo tries his best to find and sell as much as possible but along his way, he finds himself alongside with other criminals who want the same for themselves. At that point and when everything seemed lost he finds Chewbacca and Lando Calrissian and now all together try to expose the criminal underworld.I liked this movie because it presented very well the story behind Han Solo, the start of his friendship with Chewbacca and how those two became best friends and of course the story of Millennium Falcon. The direction which was made by Ron Howard was very good, with many good scenes and equally good CGI. I also liked the interpretation of Alden Ehrenreich who played as Han Solo and he was very good at it. Some other interpretations that have to be mentioned were Emilia Clarke's who played as Qi'ra, Donald Glover's who played as Lando Calrissian, Woody Harrelson's who played as Beckett and Paul Bettany's who played as Dryden Vos and he was also very good at this role.To sum up, I have to say that ""Solo: A Star Wars Story"" is a great movie to watch, with a good direction, interesting plot with many good scenes and some very good interpretations made by its cast. I recommend everyone to watch this movie because I believe that you are going to enjoy it very much. If you are a fan of Star Wars then you have to watch it because I am sure that you are going to love this movie and its story.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
55,cruise01,A lot of fun and excitement that will make this spin off worth seeing.,9,26 May 2018,"Solo: A Star Wars Story (4.5 out of 5 stars). Solo: A Star Wars Story is the second spinoff in the anthology series of the film universe it is trying to build. Solo is definitely the film they wanted to base it on the fan favorite scoundrel character Han Solo. The film is a lot of fun. It is action packed. The visual effects are incredible. And Ron Howard's dark lighting direction was also good too. And the one question that most people had is, does Alden Ehrenreich live up to the character with his performance? Yes, he does. He delivers the wise cracking character. Just like how people fell in love with Harrison Ford's character. The plot follows Han (Alden Ehrenreich) who is trying to escape the world of Corellia with his love interest Qi'ra (Emilia Clarke). But when their paths are separated and Han wants to earn enough money to buy a ship of his own. Just so he can escape with Qi'ra. Han meets Tobias (Woody Harrelson) and his crew of bandits who are trying to rob coaxium for a crime lord Dryden (Paul Bettany). While they have to face against marauders who are after the same thing. Solo may not be the best star wars film. I will say it is better than Rogue One. Since it does have more memorable characters even if they are in the movie briefly. The plot may seem a little unnecessary and more of an add on film to the universe. But it gives a backstory to Han Solo's character. As he is pulled into a crime syndicate world. Robbing for crime lords to buy there way out. And people double crossing each other a few times. Which makes it difficult for Han to even trust anyone. The film does have a lot of action sequences that will keep you entertained. From the beginning pod chase in a shipbuilding planet. To a dizzying and thrilling train heist. To a chaotic riot in a mining planet and a millennium falcon escape through a gas field space. I will say the climax of the film is a bit short and smaller compared to any of the Star Wars films. Which is involving Han facing against Dryden. But nonetheless, it was still a good flick. Alden Ehrenreich was great as Han Solo. It is difficult to see anyone else portraying this young character. Woody Harrelson was good too as Han's mentor of this crime world. Emilia Clarke is incredible as Qi'ra. Donald Glover was amusing as Lando, an egocentric character that is about style and substance. Paul Bettany was an okay villain. His character is a little underdeveloped. Overall, Solo: A Star Wars Story is a really good film. The action and visual effects are incredible and worth the price of admission. The cast ensemble was great. The plot is more of science fiction crime heists film with aliens, bandits, and lots of twist and turns with people double-crossing each other. I do recommend seeing this in theatres if you are a Star Wars fan or want to see a big action science fiction film.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
56,zkonedog,Paint-By-Numbers Star Wars Story,6,6 June 2018,"There is nothing inherently wrong with ""Solo"". It does pretty much exactly what it sets out to do (create an adventurous tale) and is pretty entertaining for its two hours and 15 minutes runtime. It seems as if director Ron Howard was able to piece what looked to be a mess of a filming process together to (as he usually is able) construct a movie that flows very well.All of that being said, ""Solo"" is also a movie that I will likely never think about again once I exited the cinema doors. Despite being technically ""well made"", it is also a film that does not need to exist (again, outside of selling tickets and making money). There is very little artistic value in the endeavor whatsoever.For a basic plot summary, ""Solo"" tells the story of everyone's favorite roguish space-cowboy Han Solo (Alden Ehrenrich) as a youngster (or, at least younger than the Harrison Ford-portrayed character from the original trilogy). He's given a new love interest (played by Emilia Clarke) that is new to the franchise, but also meets some ""old friends"" in Chewbacca (Joonas Suotamo) and Lando Calrissian (Donald Glover). Dryden Vos (Paul Bettany) & Beckett (Woody Harrelson) also end up playing key roles in the story, as Han christens his ownership of the Millenium Falcon by traversing to multiple locations in search of freedom from bounties, poverty, and responsibilities.I can just imagine the brainstorming process behind ""Solo"", as it must have went something like ""let's dissect everything Ford said as Han in episodes IV-VI and reference it"". While that can lead to a few fun ""aha!"" moments for viewers, I would also argue it cheapens the character in the long run. For example, Han's line in Episode IV about ""making the Kessel Run in 12 parsecs"" has become legendary. This film shows, in detail, how exactly that happened. In my mind, that is a bit of a ""cheat"" (especially when the entire filmmaking process seems to be built on that very premise). Instead of trying to create new material, in this case Disney was just fine coasting on the back of Ford's iconic performance in the role, rather than doing anything to add to it.Again, however, let me reiterate: this isn't a bad movie. Even the acting performances are pretty good throughout. Glover's Lando sometimes outright steals the show, while Ehrenreich is believable as a young Han. Those two are surrounded by talented actors who do their jobs admirably. It is tough to give the actors much material to really sink their teeth into, however, when the whole film is so boxed-in by its own narrow vision.The funny thing is that I actually really, really enjoyed ""Rogue One"" (even much more than ""Last Jedi""). I thought that movie had a defined purpose (filling in a gap between the IV-VI and I-III trilogies) and was able to branch out into new territories/characters while fulfilling it. In ""Solo"", however, the whole thing just kind of felt tired from the very beginning. In the future, I hope that Disney is able to pick better Star Wars Stories to tell, or otherwise this whole franchise is going to get oversaturated very quickly. While in the strictest sense a ""success"" in terms of pure banal entertainment and production value, it amounts to a pretty hefty failure in terms of creative capital.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
57,leonblackwood,Decent performances but the storyline was bad! 4/10,4,7 January 2019,"Review:
Were do I start with this review! First of all, I thought the movie was a right mess. There wasn't any depth to any of the characters, and the action scenes looked choreographed and cheap in places. The actors didn't do a bad job but the storyline was pretty poor. It seemed to jump right in at the deep end, and it didn't stop until the very end. On the plus side, I liked the Chewy and Solo plot, and it was good to see how they joined forces, but the other characters, except for Lando, didn't have a connection to the franchise that we have grown to love. There are rumours that Qi'ra might be Rey's mother, which would make complete sense, but that is yet to be confirmed. Personally, I think that the director, Ron Howard, employed too many people for the project, so there were way too many things going on. With the original Star Wars, not the latest ones, it was purely based on one man's vision, so the pressure to stay true to the franchise must have been immense. It couldn't have helped that George Lucas was actually on set, along with the writer of Empire Strikes Back, Return of the Jedi and The Force Awakens, Lawrence Kasdan, so with all of this input, it must have been hard to create something fresh and original. I would have thought that Ron Howard had the abilities to produce a movie that everyone wanted to see, but it disappointed everyone who was looking forward to seeing how Solo became a much-loved character. Alden Ehrenreich (Han Solo) lacked Harrison Ford's wit and charisma but that is due to the writers more than the actor. Donald Glover played Lando perfectly but the corny script let everybody down. The non-stop action got a bit too much after a while, and it didn't look that great. It amazed me how they were carrying these delicate explosives but everyone was shooting all over the place. On top of that, Solo didn't give Qi'ra (Emilia Clarke) a chance to explain where and what she had been up to, which was what the audience was waiting for. When the odd-looking Darth Maul popped up near the end, it just left the whole Solo franchise open for another story, which will need a lot of tweaking because this movie really didn't go down well with the critics. Although the movie made a slight profit at the box office, it did go down as one of the biggest flops of 2018. I think that was due to the fact that everyone was anticipating the release of this movie. With all the new characters, without much introduction, and all these new robots who didn't touch the original C=3PO or R2-D2, I have to say that I was extremely disappointed with this movie. The atmospheric soundtrack made the first movies a classic but the music in this film made it seem like a kiddie movie. With such a huge budget, which is in the same ballpark as the most expensive movies ever made, I'm sure the studio will have to question the direction of the Han Solo story. I know that I usually tell you about the storyline in my reviews, but this plot was such a mess, I thought that I would leave it up to you to make up your mind. I don't think that this movie will make any sense until they do release a sequel, which will explain what part Qi'ra plays in the whole franchise, and with the introduction of Darth Maul, I just hope that they don't produce another weak film like this one.
Disappointed!Round-Up:
This movie was directed by Ron Howard, who also brought you Grand Theft Auto in 1977, Night Shift, Splash, Cocoon, Gung Ho, Willow, Parenthood, Backdraft, Far and Away, The Paper, Apollo 13, Ransom, Edtv, How The Grinch Stole Christmas, A Beautiful Mind, The Missing, Cinderella Man, The Da Vinci Code, Frost/Nixon, Angels & Demons, Presidential Reunion, The Dilemma, Made In America, Rush, In The Heart of the Sea and Inferno. It's definitely an impressive filmography, so he would have been my top choice to direct this film, but as he didn't write it, I can only think that was what went wrong. With films like Zelda, Pinocchio and Pavarotti in production, I can't see the failure of this project will be holding him back. Although I didn't think that much of the film, it is his biggest opening ever, just behind the Da Vinci Code which also didn't go down with the critics too well, so he's quite happy with the outcome. A lot of people are saying that it was released too close to the Last Jedi, which came out 6 month earlier, which is why the next Star Wars movie, directed by J.J. Abrams, isn't due to be released until December 2019. Anyway, I'm quite a fan of Ron Howard's work, and his films usually get high praise from critics, so this just has to go down as a bad day at the office.Budget: $300million

58,TheMovieDiorama,Solo: A Star Wars Story may be wholly unnecessary but remains another enjoyable ride on the Millenium Falcon.,7,25 May 2018,"If ever there was a franchise film with major production issues, this is it. ""Fired"" directors, tight deadline, unfinished script...suffice to say the force was not used wisely. However, bring in the experienced Ron Howard to get the job done and credit to him for actually crafting an entertaining blockbuster. A young Han Solo joins a smuggling crew to acquire coaxium and deliver it to the ominous Crimson Dawn syndicate. Yes, we get it. No one asked for this spinoff and most viewers couldn't really care. But guess what? We got it. So stop complaining, sit back and enjoy this galactic adventure. Expectations were pretty low, the buzz for this flick was minimal and I think that helped. The character of Solo is beloved by many fans, and his backstory is thoroughly explored. Chronicling how he became the galaxy's best pilot, how he obtained his name, how he met Chewbacca and how he founded the Millenium Falcon. Little droplets of nostalgia are splashed across this minimised adventure that will appeal to newcomers and fans. The sci-fi aesthetics blends well with the western story which enhances the narrative's pacing substantially. Ehrenreich encapsulated Solo extremely well, occasionally he tries too hard to imitate Ford's iconic portrayal through over accentuated body movements, but for the most part he did well. Glover as Calrissian was inspired. The visual effects were exceptional (as one would expect) with innovative set pieces and colossal architecture, making for some imaginative world building (particularly the gloriously intense Kessel Run segment). The story itself is light with a sense of galactic buoyancy, although the third act includes so much double-crossing that it comes across as extremely messy, as if twists had to exist for the sake of it. The lack of a clear formidable antagonist was also noticeable. It is unfortunate that this film is shrouded with the ""cash grab"" vibe and at the end of the day, it is. However the change of tone is a welcomed addition to the franchise.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
59,Tweetienator,Not Dead But Undead,4,10 September 2018,"The production is good, that's the best thing about Solo: A Star Wars Story. The story is very lazy writing (expressed benevolently) and the acting all in all pretty standard without real charisma or substance etc. Some scenes and ideas almost feel like a parody a la Spaceballs.Anyway, imo all hope is gone: if I think about all those animation series and those ""blockbusters"" done by Disney, I really don't see how this franchise will (miraculously) improve.Maybe after Lucas produced The Battle for Endor, and made Ep I to III the whole franchise already steered to be a cash cow for selling merchandise of all kinds to kids. Also, all those added animation series just added heavily to that direction. Disney obviously tries to make their Star Wars movies to fit for adults and a younger audience at the same time, but they do mostly not succeed. The real dark moments of the first three original movies are all gone, only Rouge One is imo a good one. Star Wars may be not dead but for certain is undead...",Solo - A Star Wars Story

At the end of the day, they are what they are. I'm starting to realize that what they are isn't that bad. Solo was almost really good. It has nice performances and some terrific action scenes. My favorite was the one with the train (or monorail or what-ever-it was). However, ""Solo"" has an overly complicated plot. These Disney movies spend too much time worrying about connecting all of the Stars Wars dots. It drags Solo down quite a bit. The cast did a nice job. Alden Ehrenreich and Donald Glover were both very good and played off each other very well. I do, however, have a problem with how Glover's character was played. I don't understand what they're trying to do with the Lando Calrissian character. The biggest demerit, is that they made the always dreamy Thandie Newton kiss, the always likeable, Woody Harrelson on the mouth. Yuck.

62,matthewssilverhammer,The Worst Since Attack of the Clones,5,1 June 2018,"These stand-alone Star Wars prequels are an interesting breed; neither as vital or impactful as the ""official"" episodes, they still carry the baggage of the Star Wars universe. First, Rogue One gave us the surprisingly compelling story of how the rebels got the Death Star plans, and now Solo shows us the pre-Skywalker life of beloved scoundrel Han Solo. Perhaps unfairly, the main job I gave this film was to convince me it deserves to exist other than to make Mickey Mouse more money. Outside of some fun moments and interesting (but unnecessary) fleshing out of the universe, it still comes off as superfluous. 
Covering the events that led Han to meet Chewbacca, Lando, and the Millennium Falcon, it's largely a cavalcade of fan service winking and unwanted explanations. (Did anyone wonder how Han Solo got his name? No.) At the center is Ehrenreich, given the impossible job to reboot an iconic character, and unfortunately, he can't overcome that Herculean-task. He's not Hayden-Christensen-as-Anakin bad, but he struggles in similar ways, trying to find the right balance between throwback and freshness. Sadly, the script does him no favors, forcing him to repeat tired lines (""I got a good feeling about this""), revisit old emotional beats (romanticizing the Millennium Falcon), and convey a convoluted ending.
However, there's too much care and money put in these things for them to be complete disasters. The visuals are impressive and lived-in (if too dark), the meeting-Chewie scene is unexpectedly cool, the Kessel Run is nostalgic fun, and Glover steals every scene as magnetically cool Lando. This may keep it from being the worst Star Wars film; however, it's easily the most inconsequential.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
63,Movie_Muse_Reviews,"Another fun ""Star Wars"" adventure that could've done more justice to its title character",7,30 May 2018,"Just how far is the ""galaxy far, far away"" expanding? ""Solo,"" the second ""A Star Wars Story"" after 2016's ""Rogue One"" gives us more of a hint as to how Lucasfilm and Disney view this beloved franchise beyond its main stories, and so far, their intent appears to be to keep things on course, or as young Han Solo is told many times in this film, ""stick to the plan and do as you're told.""Obviously Phil Lord and Chris Miller, ""Solo's"" initial directors, didn't heed that advice, and so they jumped ship and Ron Howard came aboard, who's as reliable and capable as they come, though hardly as ""interesting"" as the ""21 Jump Street"" and ""LEGO Movie"" duo. ""Solo"" is consequently a reliable ""Star Wars"" movie that does right by fans and checks all the boxes of a blockbuster of its pedigree.Han Solo is a classic seat-of-his-pants hero who embodied ""coolness"" for an entire generation, so telling his backstory made sense even if filling Harrison Ford's boots would be a huge challenge for a new actor. Alden Ehrenreich was clearly asked to take on as much of Ford's affect as possible rather than tap into his own charisma and watching him try to do his best impression becomes a little bit of a preoccupation throughout the film. That said, there are a handful of moments when he nails a smirk or a line and it feels like we're watching the same character, not a new actor. Any gripes with the new Han Solo should not be placed at Ehrenreich's feet but that of the writers. Longtime ""Star Wars"" writer Lawrence Kasdan and son Jonathan craft many fun moments with catharsis for fans, but what one would presume to be the core of the film - the story of how Solo became Solo - gets lost in the finished product.Ehrenreich's Solo is cocksure and optimistic. When we meet him at the beginning of the film he is a teenage thief for crime boss Lady Proxima on Corellia, dreaming of escape with his girlfriend, Qi'ra (Emilia Clarke). When the two make a run for those dreams, they're separated, and Solo ends up with a band of professional thieves led by Beckett (Woody Harrelson). As he goes down this path, he retains this sense of optimism, which - knowing what we know about Solo in ""Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope,"" means something will lead him to become Ford's grumpier and standoffish Solo of the original trilogy. But that arc trails off in ""Solo"" despite the film's many pluses.Another way of putting it: As Lucasfilm tried to make an exciting ""Star Wars"" movie, they forgot to make it hinge more on its title character. Beckett, Qi'ra, ""young"" Chewbacca (Joonas Suotamo), young Lando Calrissian (Donald Glover) L3-37 (Pheobe Waller-Bridge), villain Dryden Vos (Paul Bettany), Enfys Nest - they're all colorful and compelling supporting characters, the kind ""Star Wars"" is known for, capturing our imagination, but pushing Solo out of the limelight. Odds are this was incidental, but the combination of getting those characters right and the lack of clarity around Solo's character make it stand out.""Solo"" also seems preoccupied with showing fans how things came to be: how Han met Chewbacca, how exactly Han acquired the Millennium Falcon from Lando, how Han did the Kessel run in less than 12 parsecs - even how he got the name Han Solo. Sometimes it's just a scene, sometimes the plot bends entirely to that purpose. The success rate varies, but the explanations that do work really work. The Han-Chewie dynamic, to name a positive, is one of the biggest strengths.As a blockbuster, ""Solo"" never gets boring and stays a step ahead of its audience in terms of plot. The action all works, especially the train heist sequence toward the beginning. As Lucasfilm has done well all along in this new era of ""Star Wars,"" the look, feel and tone of ""Solo"" jives with everything else ""Star Wars."" It's a safe and dependable course of action for Lucasfilm and Disney to take, but spinoffs should be a little more daring, or at least give fans a chance to connect at an even deeper level with a beloved character. ""Solo"" mostly uses Han as a springboard into another fun but familiar ""Star Wars"" chapter.~Steven CThanks for reading! Visit Movie Muse Reviews for more",Solo - A Star Wars Story

65,southdavid,Han - dle with care,6,1 June 2018,"""Hmm.... I didn't love it"". About 12 hours after watching it that's my overriding feeling about ""Solo"". I didn't hate it either, that should be said.... But I'm struggling to really elucidate on why to either response.... But as I am trying to review everything I see, I'm going to have to give it a go. Easy bit first.... Brief plot synopsis. The Young Han Solo Chronicles see Han (Alden Ehrenreich) escape from his downtrodden existence as a thief on Correllia first by joining the Empirical army, then by deserting to join Beckett's (Woody Harrelson) heist crew and trying to land the big score that will allow him to buy a ship and head home to rescue his childhood sweetheart, Qi'Ra (Emelia Clarke). So the performances are alright. Alden Ehrenreich is fine, but I never really bought any connection to Harrison Ford's character. Woody Harrelson, is probably the standout of the new characters. Donald Glover's Lando is a bit underwhelming, he doesn't do anything wrong - it's just an underwritten character or perhaps it's more like that Lando is included in the film more than he should have been. Paul Bettany's Dryden Vos , the principle villain though is a clichéd letdown (overly friendly switching to psychotic is done too often) and the CGI characters generally all feel like tired reruns of things we've seen before, particularly Rio Durant, voiced by Jon Favreau. The story is patchy. It does get better as it goes on and the conclusion is pretty good. It's obviously restricted in what it can do, as half its cast appear in later films - so any jeopardy they are put in lacks tension, but I felt like they tried to artificially cover for that by having other characters perish without enough build up to really make us care. Some of the dialogue is really quite terrible and a few of the jokes fell flat. It also suffers from ""Show, don't tell"" problems. In the first scenes, Han and Qi'Ra are desperate to get off Correllia as it's a terrible place, but it's only them telling each other that makes us see that. Their clothes are clean, they look well fed and they've managed to steal something to buy their passage off. You might also question how a large worm that can't stand sunlight could rise to the top of the criminal underworld. . but that's not addressed either. (Maybe she'll get an origin film in a decade or two). It's all just a little too disjointed. It would have been interesting to know if I'd have thought the same without knowing that Ron Howard replaced Lord and Miller during filming. I feel that decision goes to the heart of the problem with it, it's a very ... safe film. Committee designed. ""We must show the meeting with Chewie, the meeting with Lando, seeing the Falcon, the Kessell Run"" and the rest of the film is just filler to get you to those moments.So the result is a film that's fine . . . and I'd happily go and see ""Solo 2"" but not really good enough when compared to the other films in the franchise.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

67,Vartiainen,The things this film does to the canon,4,16 July 2018,"For a film that had three different directors, this could have been a lot worse. Lets all keep that in mind. Phil Lord and Christopher Miller were replaced by Ron Howard halfway through the filming and the latter ended up re-shooting the majority of the film. And to Howard's credit, you can barely tell.That doesn't mean the film is good. It has good things in it, certainly, but personally I hate what it does to Han Solo as a character, and to a lesser degree to Star Wars as a franchise.The positives first, I think. It looks and sounds like Star Wars. The framework we've all grown to love is there. Everything on the visual and all-around technical side is as it should be. The action scenes are not particularly memorable, I have to admit, lacking that spark, but they're not bad either. Mostly this is due to the film trying for a more low-key underworld type of mood, with it being a story about Han Solo, the rogue of rogues, after all. It mostly works.What doesn't work are the characters. The most egregious being Alden Ehrenreich as Han Solo. I simply cannot buy this man as Han Solo. Sure he's younger and more inexperienced, but the essential character traits aren't there. The character on display here isn't suave, isn't cocky, isn't kind of a jerk, isn't larger than life, isn't self-assured, and only has the bare minimum of skill under his belt. He feels like a bleached, kid-friendly version of the original scoundrel, with no bite to him.I also don't like the fact that all the facts we've ever learned about Han Solo are on display in this film. Because that means that all the Han Solo in the original trilogy ever talked about was this one big adventure. And the Han Solo I know and grew up loving sure did not have only one single adventure under his belt before the events of A New Hope. No way, no how.That being said, there are some good characters as well. Like Donald Glover as Lando Calrissian. I don't buy Ehrenreich as Solo, but I'm totally convinced that Glover's character is a young Lando. Joonas Suotamo as Chewbacca is also pretty good and I enjoyed both Emilia Clarke and Woody Harrelson portraying new, never before seen characters. Granted, Harrelson's character is superfluous and the movie would have been more streamlined if his role in the plot had been combined with Lando, but Harrelson is a charismatic actor, no doubt.All in all I have to admit I don't like this film. It's one of those rare sequels that actively make the original films worse by giving us a glimpse behind the curtain, showing and telling us things we would rather not have learned. And for that I hate it.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

He soon meets thief/smuggler, Beckett (Harrelson) and his associates who attain hyperfuel for businessman, Dryden Vos (Bettany). Along the way, Han meets gambler/pilot, Lando Calrissian (Glover) and hairy creature, Chewbacca (Suotamo) who becomes his sidekick. Clarke (Game of Thrones) plays

69,jamesrupert2014,"Excellent production let down by flat, anticlimactic ending",7,20 January 2019,"Iconic 'lovable rogue' Han Solo both learns and teaches life-lessons as he befriends a Wookie and acquires a 'Corellian light freighter' in this free-standing 'origins' opus. Stories like this are extremely hard to do when, as in the case of Solo, both the persona and the fate of the character have been firmly established over the course of the highly successful series and most fans are feverishly devoted to their personal perceptions of the character, the closest thing to an anti-hero the black and white Star War's universe has. The film is visually excellent and the plot and characters generally quite good, but the ending is so abrupt that I expected to see ""End of part 1"" rather than the immediate cut to closing credits. Anyone expecting the last 20 minutes of 'Solo: A Star Wars Story' to be like the last 20 minutes of any other Star Wars story will be greatly disappointed. On the plus side, despite the overall soft-pedaling of Solos 'mercenary' side, director Howard demonstrates that Han will 'shoot first' if conditions so warrant, thereby undermining George Lucas' highly unpopular attempts to emasculate the character. The script also finally 'explains' the first film's reference to making ""the Kessel Run in less than twelve parsecs"", which for decades Lucas has been doggedly denying was a technical error in the script. All in all, not a bad CGI-actioner but the lack of a strong finish really devalues this tributary into the long-running series.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

The details on how he meet Chewie and his early days has a smuggler, and first meeting with Lando Calrissian (Donald Glover).Really liked it, everything you enjoyed in a Star Wars film. The effects are incredible. Alden Ehrenreich brings his own to the role of Han Solo, while not doing a copy of Harrison Fords performance from the original films, and at the same time shows moments that remind us of why we liked Solo from the start. Scenes with Chewie are the funniest. Donald Glover has young Lando shows he watched enough of Billy Dee Williams performance, to the point where I believe he is a young Lando. All the other actors do well also. Not quite as memorable has Rogue One(2016), but still good.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

This is another of the stand alone Star Wars movies that are connected to the main story line but are sort of filling in information that might have not have been shown in the main story line-it's also making lots of money for Disney-sort of like Rogue One did. This one takes place about 10 years before Star Wars A New Hope-episode 4-and fills in the background information on Han Solo. You know, all the burning questions you might have had about his past; how he met and befriended Chewbacca and Lando Calrissian, how he acquired his Millennium Falcon, the significance of his dice he always carried around with him or even how he got his name. All these questions are answered. You also get to see the famous Kessel run-he was always saying how he made the Kessel run in under 12 parsecs. Alden plays Han. And he doesn't just do an imitation of Harrison Ford, but, you can almost hear Harrison saying the lines. Woody plays a thief that takes Alden under his wing and teaches him some powerful life lessons. Donald plays Lando and Emilia plays Alden's girlfriend. It's directed by Ron Howard and he usually gives his real life brother, Clint, a cameo role in his movies-which he does here, too. There is a big surprise cameo of a character from one of the other Star Wars movies-I won't give it away here. 
It's rated ""PG-13"" for sci-fi action and violence and has a running time of 2 hours & 15 minutes.
I really liked this one and would buy it on Blu-Ray.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

74,XweAponX,Excellent Star Wars story,10,17 September 2018,"And here I was expecting it to be bad, but it was actually great. It was almost as good as Rogue One.  And Disney put all other Star Wars side films on hold because this was allegedly bad? They need to get their heads examined, all three of them. This kid who is playing the younger Solo (Alden Ehrenreich) has his mannerisms exact, even though he does not look much like Harrison Ford. It was a great choice. I never saw Han Solo sticking to one particular love interest before he had met Leia so I thought it kind of odd that he had one here, but that whole thing is self-explanatory.  And it was great to see the actresses from HBO's Westworld and Game of Thrones (Emilia Clarke and Thandie Newton) as important characters in the story: it took a while for me to recognize the mother of dragons, I was asking myself who is that? why does she look familiar? then it dawned on me halfway through oh, blonde hair. Got it. And then Maive from Westworld was much easier to spot, but she had a truncated role in this. Then add in a little bit of Woody Harrelson, Donald Glover as Lando Carlissian, and Paul Bettany and were all set. The voices of Jon Favreau and Linda Hunt (Shadout Mapes from ""Dune"") are major aliens, and we see Warwick Davis who at one time was an Ewok and other characters. And of course I recognized Clint Howard even underneath all that make up. And Ray Park does a brilliant cameo, toward the end. But somebody else does his voice, his original character never spoke much.  I really didn't find any discrepancies with the general Star Wars story, not that were important. It does not tie in with the original Star Wars movie as much as Rogue One did, this one ties in to Episode One, a little bit. I don't know if we are ever going to learn why until they take all of the other Star Wars side-movies off of hold. And I find Disney's reasoning why this happened it to be flawed, because this movie is very good, it's much better than Disney said. And this was one well-made movie. I'm not sure if Ron Howard had directed all of this or just part of it but it was well directed, whoever directed It. And the special effects do not overwhelm the story but are part of the story, they are treated as common place. It's commonplace to see guys with four arms, Aliens with five eyes on Stalks, all kinds of droids, what is funny about the droid L3 is that she looks almost exactly like Alpha from the Power Rangers. I don't know if this was on purpose but it was unmistakable. And the millennium falcon looks slightly different and its brand spanking new when we first see it, this film even explains its current appearance. The main theme for this film is trust no one, or at least be able to anticipate who is going to come up as a traitor. And this movie isn't absolutes like most of the other Star Wars films, there are characters that are not simply evil or good, as in real life, people are many shades of gray. That is what we see here.  And you never know who is going to turn up as an important ally. Nothing is as it seems, as they say in the Red Fringe Universe. But the mystery here is why are all the trolls ganging up on the Star Wars movies? I have seen the same verbatim one star review at least 15 times, identical words, ""different"" authors. And one day after I posted this review it has been attacked by three or four of these trolls. Because most real people don't rush to their computers or hand devices to post one star reviews of every movie made, and they certainly don't create multiple accounts just so they can downvote my review five times, like somebody did here.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
75,alindsay-al,An above average fun film,7,24 May 2018,"This film has had a lot of backstory do it and with mixed reactions I have now seen Solo: A Star Wars Story and I thought this was a fun film but considering the expectations an overall disappointing film. The premise of the film sees a young Han Solo go on a journey to find his place I the galaxy. Alden Ehrenreich plays young Han Solo in this film and he does an alright job, you can see him as a genesis of what Han Solo will become. Though I felt like at times he was mumbling a lot and didn't buy him as the confident character that Han is, but overall he did a decent job. The supporting cast is a large one and overall was pretty decent, Woody Harrelson plays his smuggling mentor in this film and I really liked him in this film. I felt like he was the ideal casting for the role and I liked how he fit into this film and how it affected Han's world. Donald Glover plays a young version of Lando Carrissean and he was the perfect choice for this role. He has the charm and charisma that would be required for Lando and I feel like he was definitely the best part of this film and stole every scene he is in. The part we were all looking forward to was seeing Han and Chewbacca interact in this film and I loved seeing Chewbacca's character in this film and really enjoyed there dynamic in this film. Though I have to point out Emilia Clarke's character was pretty poor in this film, she was just a generic love interest in this film and her character motivations in the film are so confusing I lost track of it at one point. After this and Terminator Genesys I worry for Clarke that after Game Of Thrones she might not have a huge future ahead of her. The story in the film shows a young Han going through there smuggling life and it leads to some interesting sequences and as mentioned before I liked Han and Chewbacca's relationship in this film. However, this film lacks a lot of structure to it and it feels like one travelling from one place to another just to get a film made, also I felt the overall plot was pretty predictable which hurt the overall quality of the film. The script has some fun quips in it, and it felt pretty natural for most of it. But some of the dramatic dialogue scenes didn't really connect with me and it led to me not caring about certain sequences in the film. The style of the film has some really entertaining action scenes in it that got me excited for sure, but I do have some issues. Especially for the first act this film is incredibly dark in its lighting and it's hard to focus on what is going on because it is very dull looking. Also none of the action scenes really stood out for me as something completely new and fresh which was disappointing. Overall I liked aspects of this film and think if you are a Star Wars Fan you should see this film but if you are new to the franchise I don't feel like it is good enough to win you over.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
76,CubsandCulture,Unfairly Maligned. Star War at its most pure...,10,3 December 2018,"I really don't understand why this film didn't do as well at the box office and with general audiences as Rogue One did. I found it to be a great spin-off that managed to really capture the 30's and 40's serials spirit that A New Hope was infused with. It is not the best film in the franchise but it has a legit claim at being the most fun you can have with a Star Wars film. The quips are funny; the action intense; the story straight forward with a lot of memorable moment.s I almost want to cut the film apart into chapters and release it as a serial. It is that good at capturing the feel of things like Buck Rogers.Solo isn't really necessary and I think that allowed the filmmakers to indulge in some clever retconning. Lando saying ""Han"" wrong means something now. Kessel Run in 12 parsecs makes sense now. My only really problem with the film is they tried to connect it to the larger story too much. Solo is at its best when it is just being the other adventures of Han.Ehrenreich makes a fun and fine Han Solo and I found it very easy to accept him in the role after about 10 minutes. Ford, of course, is better but there's nothing wrong with the casting. Bettany makes a great scene chewing villain. And Glover steals the show as Lando. The cast all have a comedic spark to them that make the film really fun.Too many Gen Xers and Baby Boomers have let nostalgia cloud their judgment. I don't get the hate. It's not like The Last Jedi where the film is intentionally alienating fans. Go see Solo, especially if you think TLJ ""ruined"" Star Wars.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

With impossibly huge shoes to fill, Harrison Ford's, Alden Ehrenreich does an admiral job of emulating Solo's quick wit, bravado and smoothness with the ladies. The movie's tone played off of Solo's personality, thus it had a bit more whimsy, jokes and light-heartedness yet it didn't disappoint with ample action scenes, rich story and quirky characters. The core of this movie is learning how Solo gained experience as a thief and smuggler as well as playing and seeing all the angles and how everyone is out to hoodwink you. Overall the action is top grade, the female robot is pretty funny and sassy and the story was well-scoped. It ends leaving you with a how his story connects into the Star Wars cannon.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
78,Fluke_Skywalker,Solo? More like So-So,6,28 May 2018,"Plot; A young scoundrel gets swept up in events that will set him on the path to greater things.There are two parts to this review. One part is strictly review of the film Solo: A Star Wars Story. The other part is a (brief) commentary on Disney and the state of the franchise. The movie? It's okay. I was never bored, but I was also never thrilled. It wants to take full flight in fits and starts, but even those moments rely greatly on our (or at least my) affection for the characters and their stories that are, as of this timeline, yet to come. The cast is fine, but none of the new characters are particularly memorable. Of those playing younger versions of classic characters, Donald Glover as Lando fares the best. He manages to evoke Billy Dee w/o falling into an impression. Much has been made of Alden Ehrenreich as the young Han, w/reports coming out that his performance had been so bad that Disney had to bring in an acting coach. If this is true, then very little of that ""bad"" performance remains here and the acting coach earned their money. As if it were filmed in sequence, he settles in nicely after a shaky start and by the end he's very comfortable in his smuggler's gear. There's nothing offensively bad about Solo @ all, but that's not exactly how I want to come out of a Star Wars movie feeling. As for the brief Disney commentary. *sigh* Look, I know I'm the prototypical old dude fan sitting in his rocker and groaning ""Back in my day..."", but Disney needs a course correction. Now. This movie-a-year (or in this case, every six months) is overkill. Star Wars should be special. An event. I know you've gotta get that $4 billion back, but let the saga breath a bit. If not every three years, then @ least every two. And these ""A Star Wars Story"" deals. Not every character needs their own standalone film. We don't need Ugnaught #3 A Star Wars Story, m'kay? Lastly, a little QC. In four films, two of them have had major problems w/production/post production. You pulled Rogue One out of the fire, and Han Solo was probably better than it had any right to be, maybe--just maybe--this scattered focus is one of the problems. I say shelve everything until you make the best possible Episode IX, because on my ledger you're 0-1-1 on these so far. Then chart your course post Skywalker saga and remember that sometimes less is more. End of rant.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

The main western/heist plot line is done well and contains plenty of moments referenced by characters in the original trilogy. Han's first encounter with Chewie is a good concept and his first time in the pilot seat of the Millennium Falcon is a crowd pleaser.All characters were good but I felt there were too many to get fully invested in any of the new ones. Qi'ra's presence could have been reduced for me and L3 was pretty unnecessary. The less said about the well known baddie revealed near the end the better. Yet another unnecessary Disney character resurrection.Ron Howard went a bit over the top with the spectacle at times, particularly in the Kessel run sequence and some of the early war-zone scenes. For me those combat sequences stole the thunder from the later ones in the coaxium mines.It finishes mostly strongly, particularly the final quick draw moment. It almost feels like Disney reminding George Lucas that his original version of the Greedo scene in the first Star Wars movie was the true Han Solo and he shouldn't have changed it for the Special Edition.All performances are good, especially Alden Ehrenreich, Donald Glover, Woody Harrelson and Paul Bettany.Did Ehrenreich make me believe he was the iconic character? No, but it's not his fault as there is only one Han.Is it a necessary story to tell? Arguably not.Does this version of Han add anything to the franchise? Probably not.Is it worth watching? Yes.

If you're annoyed by lots of foreshadowing(is that what it's called in a prequel?) you'll hate this but at least you know that no one will say the title in the movie. It was nice to hear all the Solo quips but they evened it out by doing things like trying to make us think Lando is a danger to Han. And it was lame that Lando immediately mispronounces Han's name.

Like many of the other recent additions Solo simply lacks the ingredients that made some but not all, of the original films so endearing. The characterisation of Han Solo is missing much of the swagger and devil may care charm and wit of the original. This problem is aggravated by a weak back story that has Han growing up in a sci fi version of a Dickensian dock land.Poor Han is raised, if that's the right word, by a weird criminal underworld Fagin-esque muppet like creature, that lives in a pond and has a vampire's aversion to sunlight. If that sounds stupid and illogical, you are in good company.Things don't improve as the story progresses either. There's a series of peculiar and inexplicable events that eventually brings Han into contact with his walking rug side-kick Chewbacca. This in turn sets the stage, in unconvincing style, for his transformation into rogue smuggler with a heart.On the upside the special effects are mostly decent and the action scenes well done, if predictable. That said, none of this is enough to save Solo, for me at least, from applying the label of ""mediocre"". 5/10 from me.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
87,I_Ailurophile,"A surprisingly fun, solid sci-fi adventure",8,18 December 2020,"I had low expectations going into 'Solo.' Reviews upon release were mixed, and just as much to the point: I'm not someone that's terribly invested in Star Wars. I think the ""original trilogy"" is okay, try to forget about Episodes I-III, and think 'Rogue One' is the best thing the Star Wars universe has to offer. I've no particular interest in any additional content on Disney+, and after watching 'The Force Awakens' and 'The Last Jedi,' I've felt disconnected from the franchise to the point of probably not watching anything more. It's not that I dislike the latter two films, but as much as I like the cast... Star Wars just isn't for me, I don't think.Despite those low expectations--given the chance to watch this, I was very pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed 'Solo.'I was immediately reminded of my love for 'Willow' that sprung from the very first time I watched it and that persists to this day. It's not that 'Solo' has anything to do with 'Willow,' BUT--the same feeling of adventure, of excitement, of childlike wonder and enjoyment, is built into every frame. I got the same feeling watching 'Solo' that I had in my childhood watching 'Willow,' and I suspect that if 'Solo' were made when I were much younger, I'd have fallen in love with it just as readily and deeply.Of course, that said, I didn't watch 'Solo' as a child, but as an adult. For as much as Star Wars movies are geared towards kids (yes, all of them), I have a need to consider 'Solo' not just from the perspective of my inner child (I didn't think they still existed), but from the perspective of... me. And I liked it.The casting is excellent, and all the actors play their roles very well. The effects are as good as one should expect of ILM post-""Episodes I-III,"" and the plot and action never feels like it rushes, nor lags. The narrative isn't the end-all-be-all of sci-fi, but it's also not supposed to be: These are the early days of Han Solo, and the movie does an admirable job telling the story of how a scrappy ne'er-do-well became the wry rogue audiences have adored for decades. In the space of a little more than 2 hours we grow to care about all the characters we meet, even the ones that don't make it to the end of the film.Special shout-out for the cameo appearance of Warwick Davis--who I of course have adored basically my whole life, again thanks to 'Willow.' (But, oh yeah, I guess he was in other Star Wars stuff too, eh?)Even putting aside the churlish, toxic gatekeepers who tut-tut anything new in a fandom that isn't THEIR (insert franchise name here), I understand that this isn't for everyone. But for my part, I didn't expect much when I started watching 'Solo,' and in the end quite enjoyed it.Maybe I'm being unfair by somewhat swearing off Star Wars. I've certainly heard good things about The Mandalorian; if I enjoyed 'Solo' and 'Rogue One,' why shouldn't I give it a try? (Apart from not wishing to buy into Disney+...) Well, maybe some day.

The action is fun, but it has the same problems as the prequels. Knowing more doesn't help anything here. Seeing the Kessel Run is so not as satisfying as imagining what could have been. All the mystique and the legend is deflated by seeing how it all really happened.The problem is that this is all part of a bigger universe. Solo: A Star Wars story, yet it doesn't feel like it improves the greater Star Wars story at all. So by the end of the movie it just felt pointless to me. We're it not a Star Wars story, things may be different but as it stands this just feels like fluff.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
89,TheFearmakers,Doesn't Fly... Doesn't Even Fly Casual...,1,25 May 2018,"As is already known, Ron Howard had the task of correcting while directing SOLO - replacing the original filmmakers whose take was too comedic, or something that didn't gel with Lucasfilm's Kathleen Kennedy and writer Lawrence (partnered with son Jonathan) Kasdan...Maybe those poor young filmmakers, who made the popular kid flicks LEGO MOVIE and CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF MEATBALLS, put too much color into a story meant to be edgy and dark. If so, Ron Howard sure did darken it up, and not in a good BLADE RUNNER gloomy industrial kind of way. It's like looking outside a dirty window - at more dirt. And this galaxy doesn't seem all that far, far away like a fantasy-driven STAR WARS installment should. With human characters so immensely droll and mundane, every time the usual weird-looking alien pops up, it seems out of place and, for lack of a deeper, more insightful description, stupid. But there's really only one big question for die-hard fans concerning this STAR WARS STORY. Does He live up to Him? Him meaning Harrison Ford and He meaning Alden Ehrenreich, not tall and deep-voiced but an irritating shrimp with a nasally whine, as if Leonardo DiCaprio were imitating Christian Slater channeling Jack Nicholson. With a filler girlfriend/crush (Emilia Clarke), and the gurgling Chewbacca at his side (after meeting in a fight scene that could've been decent given more logic in the first place), Ehrenreich doesn't even seem to be trying - for anything. His brand of cocky confidence is narrowed into an annoying, bratty grin. And while critics are praising Donald Glover's imitation of Lando Calrissian, he's got as much to do with the story as anyone on board: He's just there. And bored.With a non-existent plot involving several raids including a train robbery (why would tracks be needed in a world full of hovering vehicles?) to nab some kind of expensive gas to pay off a crime lord, the attempt for a pulpy pirate adventure is drowned-out by melodramatic pathos concerning slave labor, which happens on a pathetic, pretentious, manipulative loop. Even Lando's female robot literally screams for ""equal rights."" And while Woody Harrelson tries his best as a semi-rogue named Beckett (the kind of clever/crooked mentor you'd think Solo would emulate to reach his maverick NEW HOPE persona), he's simply another ragged soul along for the ride. What's meant to be the most suspenseful scene is both a carbon-copy and contradiction of the Millennium Falcon asteroid-dodge in EMPIRE STRIKES BACK. The characters are either sitting on board the old reliable ship or flying it. Neither matters. It's as intense as watching someone play a video game, or playing one you've already mastered... While SOLO seems to be about how the experienced, world-weary smuggler acquired the guts to take big risks at a young age, Alden Ehrenreich plays him so bland and lazy, any intrepid skills seem merely built-in and unexplained during capers both simplistic and overly-complicated. But nothing's worse than the random pockets of embarrassingly awkward silences: Whether it be after Ehrenreich fouls-up yet another glib one-liner, or Chewbacca waiting passively for something meaningful to react to, Ron Howard, in attempting to resurrect a broken engine, has pieced together a vapid, sterile machine that's not just a let-down in the inevitable grade-curve of the STAR WARS franchise, but is simply a lousy, cheap-looking movie. Period.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
90,AudioFileZ,A Star War's Movie That Stands Up With The Original Nicely,7,1 October 2018,"Solo moves like a Star Wars fan can appreciate. The restless underdog against oppression. It was thirty minutes before I had time to think about much other than the plot unfolding and the action. That's when I felt as if Thaddie Newton, a very talented A-list actress, was mis-cast as Val. Maybe a bit of a stab for more credibility? The ""bigee"" though is they found the perfect actor to bring young Han Solo to life. As if to rest my over-thinking it was no time and the movie is back to heady action this time using a train which is something I don't think we've seen in Star Wars before so kudos to that.Solo may have a story that is somewhat simple, but it fits. It doesn't necessarily make the movie and it gives room for the characters to shine. They make the movie work. Woody Harrelson is a great second banana to Han as he moves from having seniority over him to full-on trusting and partnership. This is a good pairing. Of course you can't go wrong with Chewbacca and he's his usual self, moody and overachieving when needed. The introduction of the character Q'ira is welcome as Emilia Clarke shows she can really be a character you root for to not just help Han out of his situation, but as a love interest. She has a most infectious smile and cocky swagger for good measure.So, Disney got it right this time. This movie begins the long strange trip of Han Solo, and we get an worthy introduction to one of the most beloved Star War's character. Solo does the series proud.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
91,a_chinn,"Entertaining Star Wars Story, but completely forgettable",6,1 August 2019,"There was a lot of hate directed towards this movie when it first came out, so I was in no hurry to watch it and when I did finally watch I went in with extremely low expectations. My take is that it's not as bad as the haters made out and is an entertaining movie, but it's easily the worst of the Star Wars films to date (yes, worse than ""The Phantom Menace""). The story follows a young Han Solo, who was basically Oliver Twist in space as a child, and then as a young adult gets caught up with some space pirates led by Woody Harrelson. When a heist goes wrong, he finds himself having to make it up to space gangster Paul Bettany by going on an even more dangerous of heist with Harrelson and Bettany's girlfriend, Emilia Clarke, who also grew up in the streets with a young Han Solo. Sneaking, fighting, shooting, and space battle ensue. Also, an excellent Donald Glover shows up as a young Lando Calrissian and very nearly steals the movie. However, there were two major elements that made this film weak in comparison to the rest of the franchise. One, the story was a complete standalone and of no consequence to the later Star Wars stories. That's a rather minor quibble, but it made the story seem of little importance to the larger Star Wars saga, outside of being an origin story of sorts for a major character. The main weakness of the film is the lack of charisma and lackluster performance by Alden Ehrenreich as the young Han Solo. Admittedly, there's probably no one who could live us to Harrison Ford, but couldn't they find a better actor to embody Solo's humor, braggadocio, toughness, and charm? Well, that does sound like a tall order, but couldn't they have found an actor who could at least do one of those well? I'm glad they cast an unknown actor for the part because a known actor would have been distracting, but Ehrenreich's lack of onscreen charisma is a real detriment. There's even a complete lack of chemistry between Han and Chewy, which is a major disappointment. The movie is named Solo, but pretty much every other actor runs circles around him when it comes to interesting characterizations or being the most interesting person in the room. Besides the above mentioned actors, we also have Thandie Newton in a supporting role, along with Clint Howard as Ralakili who runs a droid fighting pit, and voice work by Linda Hunt and Jon Favreau. There's also a cameo by Anthony Daniels (C-3PO) as a human character, which I missed but read about later on IMDB, and a rather pointless cameo by Darth Maul in one quick scene, which Ray Park reprised his role for. Overall, ""Solo: A Star Wars Story"" is a pretty big disappointment despite being co-written by Lawrence Kasdan (""The Empire Strikes Back"" ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" ""Silverado"") and directed by Ron Howard (""Apollo 13, ""Willow"" ""Ransom"" ""The Missing""). ""Rogue One: A Star Wars Story"" remains the best Star Wars film of any of the Disney pictures thus far, but generally speaking, the one viral tweet about the Solo casting sums up my feelings on this picture:""I'm pretty sure that, given the choice, the entire Star Wars fanbase would rather just have 73 year old Harrison Ford cast as young Han Solo and pretend, through sheer stubbornness, that he looks 20""",Solo - A Star Wars Story
92,masonsaul,Extremely fun sci-fi adventure,9,18 December 2018,"Solo: A Star Wars Story is an extremely fun sci-fi adventure and great spin-off. Alden Ehrenreich gives an incredible performance and is accurate to Harrison Ford's portrayal of Han Solo. Donald Glover is perfect as Lando. Emilia Clarke, Paul Bettany and Woody Harrelson all give great supporting performances. Ron Howard's direction is also great and the action is well filmed and extremely enjoyable. The music by John Powell is excellent. There's also plenty of Star Wars Easter eggs and the CG is also incredible. However, L3-37 is an annoying character.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
93,davidmvining,A very disjointed experience,4,20 December 2019,"This feels more like several episodes of television stitched together rather than a single movie, and I think it suffers greatly for it. There's also a conflict of directorial styles that pops up from time to time that makes the experience just a little bit more jarring on top of the rest.The first episode of the film is Han's life on Corellia. He's a street thug who steals a car as the very first thing he does in the film. He runs back to his home in a subterranean tunnel and finds Qi'ra, his girlfriend. In a quick conversation of pure exposition, the two establish that they have a relationship and they want to escape. There's no real emotion here because the dialogue is too short and delivered too quickly while the relationship created is too shallow. We get no real sense of their lives on Corellia and there's no tangible reality to their dreams. It's not about some specific place, but an idea of just going. It's all very thin stuff from which to build a relationship that's supposed to carry Han's entire emotional journey for the film, but there we are.The two end up escaping to an spaceport where they get separated. Qi'ra disappears into the crowd while Han gets through the doors (with apparently no plan for how he would afford tickets) and immediately signs up for the Imperial Navy.Three years later, he's a grunt in the middle of a fight and we get the second episode. This revolves around Han escaping from Imperial service and joining a criminal crew led by Beckett out to steal highly valuable fuel from a train on another planet. Oh, and he picks up Chewbacca because of course. The job involves five characters, two of whom get a surprising amount of screen time before their quick deaths never to be mentioned again. The actual heist is excitingly filmed but more of an action scene than a heist. Still, it straddles the line and I think it pulls it off.They end up screwing up the heist and needing to come up with another way to get what they promised Crimson Dawn, the criminal organization that had hired them. This is the beginning of the third episode where Han reunites with Qi'ra who works for Dryden Vos, the Crimson Dawn bigwig who's pulling the strings. This emotional reunion falls flat because we never really got a good sense of the relationship between the split nor of Qi'ra's character at all. Together with Qi'ra, Han, Beckett, and Chewbacca fly to find a ship. Why Crimson Dawn doesn't have fast ships to use...eh...they need to bring Lando into this movie somehow, right?So, they find Lando, have a fake out for the gambling match where Han will win the Millennium Falcon from Lando, and rope him into their plot along with the incredibly abrasive L3-37, an android who's only drive is to tell people about how oppressed she is. Together, they go to Kessell where they plan a heist. This heist never really actually gets a plan and immediately turns into a chaotic action scene where L3 frees slaves, Han gets the valuable fuel, L3 dies, and the rest get away. We then get the much ballyhooed Kessel Run, designed to justify Lucas' misunderstand of what a parsec is when he originally wrote Star Wars. It's a special effects sequence that's occasionally beautiful to look at but often incomprehensible, ending with a black hole and giant tentacle monster.Finally, we get the final episode of this miniseries where Han and the gang land on a planet and figure out that some unimportant marauders that pestered them in the second episode are actually good guys and the beginning of the rebellion somehow. Han goes completely out of character and gives them a fortune, leaving nothing for himself. He also does something completely in character by killing Beckett before Beckett has a chance to kill him.The feeling of a television series never really left me, and it's largely because of the second ""episode"", more specifically because of the two characters who die then. Those are Val, Beckett's wife, and Rio, a four armed CGI alien. We spend a pretty good scene getting to know them. In fact, the relationship between Val and Beckett is better established than the one between Han and Qi'ra, but then both Val and Rio die in the action. They are then, literally, never mentioned again. They feel like guest stars in one episode of television, but audiences can't be expected to remember a guest star from three weeks ago, so they just never come up again.That's another way of me saying that there's really no story here. It's just a series of events that happen to involve the same character. What's Han's journey? Becoming Han Solo, the lovable rogue from Star Wars? I don't really see the journey because there's simply so much other stuff going on. Han kind of falls to the side for surprisingly large chunks of the film.I don't hate this film completely. I really like Alden Ehrenreich as Han. I think he has a swagger that fits the character really well. Donald Glover is great as Lando, just full of overbearing self-confidence. I also like a lot of the design of the film. The gangster at the beginning who's a giant practical worm extending from a pool of water is great, but the movie's so darkly filmed that everything's just so hard to see. My theory on that is that the special effects were done too quickly and didn't hold up to great scrutiny, so they cranked down the contrast on the images to try and hide the flaws.I find this movie really frustrating at best.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

95,jadepietro,When The Force is Not With You,5,29 May 2018,"GRADE: C THIS FILM IS MILDLY RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: Bland storytelling and a miscast lead performance by Alden Ehrenreich make a disappointing prequel. JIM'S REVIEW: The name Han Solo has been with us for over 40+ years and has become legendary in filmdom history. A colorful antihero and beloved rascal, this character would seem to be a prime subject for his own movie. But director Ron Howard does a disservice to his memory in his standard retelling of this famous outlaw. The 10th Star Wars offering, Solo: A Star Wars Story, is a stand-alone film that serves as a prequel to one of the series' most iconic characters. The movie is an additional side chapter to this most successful franchise and it takes the myths and references to those films and blends them into a diverting, if somewhat, bland whole.Behind the scenes, the making of this film was plagued with strong creative differences, ego-clashes, and a change in directors before the film's completion. (Ron Howard took over the reins after directors Phil Lord and Chris Miller were ousted.) The wear-and-tear doesn't show, but neither does the excitement or joy. This is strictly conventional sci-fi fare with sub-par production values and a script that lacks suspense or a coherent plot. The movie seems small in big budget terms. It is lensed by cinematographer Bradford Young in dingy browns and dark shadows that obscure some of the action. The CGI is uninspired and ordinary by today's standards. Neil Lamont's production design is strictly generic. Edited by Pietro Scalia, the film has no real tempo or pacing, excluding a well staged monorail robbery which is the film's high point. Scenes are just strung together from one battle to the next with little time for any real character development to transpire. If it were not for a stronger third act which finally builds to some thrills due to unexpected twists and double-crosses, Solo would have be a thorough slog-fest. As it is, the movie remains a very bumpy ride.The casting of Solo is a real issue. Alden Ehrenreich is a talented actor and he gives an admirable performance as the younger Solo. He tries valiantly and has the swagger but not the manly presence as a young Harrison Ford whom he is trying to imitate. More petulant boy than man-child, he plays the role as if puberty has not set in as he awaits a growth spirt of about 4 inches. With lotsa of smirks and posturing, he is physically wrong for the role. His boyishly good looks never match Mr. Ford's rugged persona, the years between them notwithstanding. Granted, it is a thankless task, but he is essentially miscast which throws off the other cast members. There is little chemistry between Mr. Ehrenreich and Emilia Clarke as his love interest, Qi'ra. Adding some support is Donald Glover as Lando Cairissian, Joonas Suotamo as Chewbacca, both fine in their parts, and Woody Harrelson who plays his stock character, Tobias Beckett, with little depth or emotional range. Thandie Newton is wasted in a terrible 70's hairdo. Paul Bettany is the menacing villain, Dryden Vos, although he does not have enough screen time to truly make the needed impression and conflict to resonate.The screenplay by Jonathan and Lawrence Kasdan connects the dots in filling in Solo's backstory, which might give fans some pleasure. (How did Hans get his misnomer? How did he and Chewbacca met? How did the Millennium Falcon become his spaceship?) Yet, the basic plot goes nowhere as it goes planet-hopping with each mission. Their dialog lacks clever retorts and humor while their characters remain two dimensional at best.Solo: A Star Wars Story, I'm afraid, may be only for die-hard Star Wars fans (of which there are many). However this critic was mostly bored and unimpressed with its dull storytelling and visual repetitiveness, wanting my moviegoing experience to be more than a series of battle scenes and little else. Mr. Howard may have rescued the film project from failure, but he did little to add any substance or worth. Obviously, the force was not with him or his film crew, making Solo what becomes a legend least.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

97,rgkarim,Going Solo!,8,25 May 2018,"It's been 40 years in existence, and the galaxy far away keeps expanding into the unknown territory of stories, fun, and action. Despite a rocky start, Disney has been able to finally get the precious cargo of another Star Wars movie to its destination of the theater despite all the failings it experienced. Can such a history turn out to be valuable like an armada of Star Destroyers, or will it be as worthless as Republic Credits on Tatooine. Robbie K here with another review on the movie: Movie: Solo: A Star Wars StoryDirector:
 Ron Howard
Writers:
 Jonathan Kasdan, Lawrence Kasdan 
Stars:
 Alden Ehrenreich, Woody Harrelson, Emilia Clarke
LIKES:Acting: While certainly not the legendary volumes that the original cast brought years ago, I was impressed and happy with what the new cast was able to do. Alden Ehrenrich as young Han Solo has a level of arrogance and mischief that is recognizable, just not to the proportions Ford brought so long ago. Clarke, in all her splendor, is certainly fantastic, bringing her regal air to the character Qira, and with it an added complexity to try to keep you guessing. Harrelson, still playing the cantankerous role again, has it down to an art that mixes quite well in the intergalactic crime world. Yet the star is Donald Glover, who captured the Lando qualities perfectly and delivered it with the youthful energy so long ago. It works on levels to form a new band of thieves and helps bring the story semi to life. Fun: Bottom line of this movie is that I had fun with it, and despite all the terrible set ups and track record that they have had, I enjoyed it. Solo's story is definitely an adventure, with a fast pace to keep you embedded into the thief's tale to find out who will make it unscathed through the fire. While a slightly darker tone, the movie has plenty of comedic relief and lighter moments to offset the dark, making for an enjoyable, semi-balanced movie that will appeal to many. Balanced Comedy: Let's face it, Disney's movies have been working the comedic angle hard into most of their action movies to help ease the tension. Fortunately, Solo manages to keep the comedy perspective better balanced, using it at key moments to maximize the laughs and add some character to the scene. While much is in the timing and the dialogue, but there are plenty of nostalgic moments to bring a few other guffaws out as well. It works well with the movie and further establishes the smuggler atmosphere they were going for. Action: If you saw my video vlogs, you know that I have a thing for action sequences, and after the last Star Wars movie turned away from this, I had my doubts. Solo's adventure has at least three stellar action moments to bring to the table, in the form of laser shootouts and high-flying adventure. The special effects shower in these moments, grabbing you by the shoulders and throwing you into the throngs of the dangers that await Han's arrogant, rebel without a care attitude. My favorite moment is certainly the flying scene shown in the trailer, but only you can decide which of the dances of destruction will wow you the most. DISLIKES: Character Utilization: Lots of characters means the struggle of balancing them all, and Solo does do a decent job of giving their cast a moment to shine in the CGI sun. However, for me, it didn't mean that they utilized them all to an equal degree. Despite the heavy emphasis on the trailers, many of the new characters are going to have disproportionate time spent on the screen. While they all play their role in the story, I was still hoping for more integration (like Rogue One), but the group still hasn't quite found this part down quite pat yet. Paul Bettany: None of these characters get the shaft treatment than Bettany's crime lord character. An antagonist usually has more involvement in the film than just casting a looming shower, and with someone as talented and complex as Bettany, I was hoping to see his talent come to full light. Bettany's character needed more development and time, but they dropped the ball in his development department for favor of other trinkets and gimmicks. The former Vision star held so much potential, but sadly not delivered for me. L3-37's preachiness: I love droids and I love women, and this droid therefore held high hopes for being the best artificial intelligence to date. Point to them for making a robot that speaks her mind, pilots a ship, and has some skills in infiltration because they nailed those components. Yet, there rebel rousing, preach to the masses dialogue was not impressive in the grand scheme of the movie for me. I was looking for her to really contribute to the plans concocted by the team, but instead they chose to turn her into more of a walking talk box that while passionate is semi-useless outside of merchandizing. The Story/Sequel Set Up: Fans of the legend series will know the roots of this story lie in the original trilogy, which while not the best of the books certainly had its pizazz. Solo definitely scavenged these books, took the bones and built them up to this tale. The story works in regards to highlighting aspects of his life and sticking to the origins decently enough to merit the tale. What I didn't like though, was how the story was very piece meal at times, a rushed montage of various episodes from his life that had it been given a television series would have been more fleshed out. They did a nice job of reaching a decent run time, but this movie was geared too much in setting up for what can be another movie series. Plenty of hints dropped at what lies in store, but unlike the original trilogy, the movie doesn't feel quite complete, but instead dependent on a second movie to bring things to full circle. Not my favorite way of doing things, but Solo manages to still be a semi-complete talked... for now. The Ending: After all the excitement and close calls, you hope the ending brings that final conflict to really tie things together. For me, the ending to Solo was not that at all, another rushed conclusion to try to tie up one arc and open the door for the next. I'll admit, it had some nice revelations that again hint at further movies or spin-offs to come, which gets a plus in that regards (despite still not bringing a strong antagonist back into the canon). Yet, the ending decides to go down the other skill of smugglers and tries to trick you with obvious ploys and foreshadowing to take that twist away. Even worse, the ending ""fight"" is short lived and rather dull compared to the glimmer of the previous scenes mentioned. Applause goes for the attempts at diving deeper into the character, but it still could have used some spice to pep it up. Overall: Solo turned out much better than anticipated, bringing a very charming and fun movie that certainly delivers on the promise of exploring a beloved character. It's got comedy, action, love, and darkness to drive the tale, and really makes an adventure that will take you to lightspeed. Yet, the movie is still part of the cog of another series, limiting itself so that they can open up more films or the spin-off to tell the complete story. So, while fun, the movie still doesn't fill complete to me and that is not my favorite formula. Still, I recommend a weekend trip for this one for most of the family and friends who like the series. My scores are:Action/Adventure/Fantasy: 8.0

98,burlesonjesse5,VIEWS ON FILM review of Solo: A Star Wars Story,7,29 May 2018,"Solo: A Star Wars Story is not as epic as the first three Star Wars films nor does it contain their legendary amount of build-up. There are no lightsaber fights or battles to defeat the Empire. Plus, there's no sightings of Darth Vader, the Death Star, C-3PO, or R2-D2 this time around. Oh well. ""Solo"" omits these attributes and still feels like a formidable Star Wars movie anyway. In fact, ""Solo"" is probably the most entertaining and invigorating ""Wars"" installment since 1983's Return of the Jedi.During the production of ""Solo"", Ron Howard took over for directors Phil Lord and Christopher Miller (The Lego Movie, 22 Jump Street). Lord and Miller were fired over creative differences and it doesn't help that they are essentially comedic helmers.""Solo"" while totally recommendable, doesn't quite feel like a Ron Howard project. However, the 135-minute film shows that Ronnie can hang with past Star Wars filmmakers like George Lucas, Richard Marquand, Irvin Kershner, and Gareth Edwards.Howard gives Solo: A Star Wars Story an incredibly brisk pace. Saddled with a trademark Lawrence Kasdan script, he adds relentless movement, some nifty hand-to-hand combat sequences, and some nasty, freakish creatures. His look for ""Solo"" tends to be a little foggy at times but he makes up for it. Ron uses three dimensional space well and stages intergalactic warfare with veritable aplomb. Oh and I almost forgot, ""Solo's"" editing in certain match cuts by Pietro Scalia, is smooth as silk.In terms of casting, ""Solo"" contains Star Wars universe newcomers (Emilia Clarke, Donald Glover) and Ron Howard regulars (Paul Bettany, Woody Harrelson, Clint Howard). Alden Ehrenreich in the lead as young Han, doesn't look, act, or completely strut like Harrison Ford. Still, he's likable and his performance while snarky, is enjoyably quick-witted.In retrospect, ""Solo"" under Howard's watch, isn't entirely about Han Solo despite the main character being in nearly every frame. Added to that, ""Solo"" is a little more than a personage showcase vehicle and a Chewbacca introduction. ""Solo"" in all truthfulness, is a fleeting sci-fi romp with robbery elements, a sense of mild danger, a familiar narrative concerning the Rebel Alliance, and some tongue-in-cheek humor. It will please younger viewers of the Star Wars pics because it doesn't take itself too seriously and just wants to have some popcorn-esque fun. As for the older supporters of the Star Wars franchise, well there might be some nitpicking going on. You know what, those fanboy purists just need to lighten up.

99,justin-fencsak,Forget what you heard about this movie..it's awesome!!!,8,28 September 2018,"After the controversy that was The Last Jedi divided mainstream and non mainstream Star Wars fans and grossed less than The Force Awakens, Solo came out on Memorial Day Weekend of this year to underwhelming box office results, becoming the lowest grossing Star Wars live action movie of all time if adjusted for inflation. Now this week, it's finally home, where fans and casual fans can see what the fuss is about. The result is a movie that is reminiscent of the Indiana Jones movies, with a touch of the original trilogy blended in and a bit of the prequels at the end, where Darth Maul makes an appearance. Darth Maul, after he got almost killed in Phantom Menace, got resurrected in the CGI Clone Wars tv show, then returned in this movie, per Disney canon. Emilia Clarke shines as Han's first love interest, who ventures on her own while Han is out to find Jabba..we know what happens next. Chewbacca is awesome and the aliens and robots are great. It gets a bit slow in the beginning but gets funny in the end. It's sad that there won't be as many Star Wars movies year after year but what this movie offers is pure cinematic magic. Rent it first, then decide if you want to buy it.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
100,Rob_Taylor,Actually... it wasn't too bad at all,7,25 September 2018,"With all the negativity surrounding the new Star Wars trilogy and the franchise in general, I wasn't expecting very much from this film. I was, fortunately, in for a pleasant surprise.Solo wasn't anything ground-breaking, but neither was it a mess like Last Jedi. Sure, it has some issues which I 'll get to, but on the whole, it was a decent adventure movie that kept me entertained throughout.One of the main plus points was that the movie didn't take itself too seriously. The new Han (played by Ehrenreich) is still very much the happy-go-lucky scoundrel that he was in Harrison Ford's hands. A little less knowledgeable. A lot less jaded, and a considerable amount younger. As it should be. I actually felt Ehrenreich's portrayal was a decent attempt to capture Han Solo's charismatic nature.Other characters were less likeable. Emilia Clarke's was decent as Qi'ra, though she has yet to convince me she actually knows what she is doing in any role I've seen her in.L3-3T, the new droid (Leet....geddit?) was just an annoying, grating mess. It seems that the new owners of Star Wars have difficulty creating droid characters who aren't intensely unlikeable. This one is no exception, spouting half-baked nonsense about droid ""liberation and rights"". Given the character name, I suspect her role was initially (before Lord and Miller were fired) meant to be a form of parody of such activists. Certainly, in this incarnation, she is a loud annoyance that, fortunately, we won't be seeing any more of in future, even if there ever is a sequel.The rest of the cast are fine and the story, though it will have you rolling your eyes on numerous occasions, is decent enough. We get to see the Kessel run, how Han met Chewie and so on. The early parts of the film are its weakest, with Ehrenreich striggling to keep your attention. The addition of Clarke's Qi'ra at this point doesn't help matters. However, it gets better as it goes along and there is a decent amount of chemistry between the new Han and Chewie that serves the movie well.Essentially, Solo is a heist movie. Or rather, two heists. The first goes south, leading Solo and some new friends to undertake a far more perilous second job in order to satisfy a crime boss' greed. It really is that simple. The simplicity, however, is what the movie needed. A complicated plot would only have dragged it down. As it is, the move is a decent diversion that won't have you scowling at the screen much. As mentioned, most of the faults are in a couple of characterisations. The rest...is serviceable enough.I do have a theory - touched on before - that the movie was originally meant to be far more of a comedy than it turned out to be. The droid L3-3T in particular seemed to be a deliberate poke at SJW's and I wonder if it was this character that led to Kathleen Kennedy getting rid of Lord and Miller. There are another couple of scenes involving Han - namely how he came to be called Solo and how he decided to call Chewie...Chewie - that seem a little out of place. I mean... nobody really needed to know either of those things, yet they are there, and played for comedic value. Remove them and the film would play out much the same. It makes me wonder if they were the least egregious of scenes that Lord and Miller had planned, and there are other, cut scenes, that the duo had planned that Kennedy took exception to. There may, indeed, be an entirely different version of Solo that we'll never see that the pair intended. Oh well.As it stands, though, Solo is a fine diversion that honestly stands up as one of the better Star Wars movies from the new batch. It seems as if the more production woes a Star Wars movie has under Disney's management, the better it ends up being. Rogue One was a decent film too. The new trilogy...not so much.SUMMARY: Far better than you might expect, though with a couple of annoying characters to spoil the brew. Just a hint that something much more comical was aimed for, then discarded. All in all, not the worst of the new movies.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
101,WeAreLive,Not perfect but definitely gave me the kick I need to like Star Wars again,7,17 April 2019,"Before I start my review for those who are watching the movies in chronological order this movie takes place after the Revenge of the sith and before rouge one.This movie also takes place after both clone wars cartoons but before/after Rebels if you watch the cartoons for Star Wars.Back when this movie first came out I was feeling very controversial on whether to watch it or not especially because of the mixed reviews it was getting and because of how Disney Star Wars has been going with their sequel trilogy. As I have not been very happy with, if you want to see my review for both TFA and TLJ they are available on my profile. There is also a review for Rouge One which I actually liked.As I have mentioned that I have not been happy with sequel trilogy and mainly because of The Last Jedi my love for Star Wars was completely destroyed. But, when I got around to watching this movie it have me the kick I needed to trust Star Wars again.Is it perfect?
By all means no it is not as good as the prequels, Rogue One or the original trilogy but it is far better then the sequel trilogy that I can promise you.Does this get me excited for Episode 9?
No, believe me, because of how disappointed I was with episode 8 I completely gave up on the sequel trilogy and even got to the point where I even got rid of any sequel trilogy merch I had and either threw it or sold it.Yes, I know that the new trailer for episode just recently dropped, I watched it and I had mixed feelings about it.But this review isn't about episode 9, that should be discussed on another review as for this movie. Beware for a bit of spoilers in this review.In this movie we get to learn a bit more about Han's past of how he meet chew and and how he knew Lando from episode 5.The main best part was that cameo with Darth Maul in which could be a big easter egg for a possible star wars related project.The cast including Alden Ehrenreich, Joonas Suotamo, Woody Harrelson, Emilia Clarke, Donald Glover, Phoebe Waller-Bridge, Thandie Newton, Jon Favreau and Paul Bettany did a good job as their roles.The CGI was good and it wasn't as heavy as it was in TLJ or TFA which is a good thing.Other then that it was a decent movie not the best Star Wars movie of course but much better then TFA and TLJ.

102,jellopuke,The Best Disney Star Wars movie (so far),7,17 June 2018,"Look, while this movie was totally unnecessary it was a huge improvement in what's been done lately. It took the western as basis and told a competent story with some decent set pieces and a couple of nice double crosses. Sure it was a tad too beholden to beats and moments from the original trilogy, (and some of the call-backs.. or is it call forwards? were cringe inducing) it was enough of a stand alone movie that it wasn't a total waste of time. It also left you curious what might come next, if they bother to keep up the Solo series.

2. Very wrong casting choice for Emilia Clarke - she is plain horrible in her part

107,Troy_Campbell,Decent but inessential.,6,26 May 2018,"The second standalone Star Wars story after 2016's Rogue One, this gun-slinging adventure sees a young Han Solo meet life-long friends, learn hard truths, establish his outlaw persona, and attempt the Kessel Run in less than 12 parsecs (for non-Star Wars geeks: quickly). It's a tough gig producing a satisfying origin tale for one of the most beloved characters in cinematic history; Han's enigmatic and shady backstory was a big part of what made him such a charismatic anti-hero in the first place. The job becomes even tougher when deep into the shoot Disney fires original directors Phil Lord and Chris Miller, bringing in Ron Howard to reshape and finish the film. Howard does an admirable job, but there are many flaws highlighting the long and tumultuous journey in getting this movie made, not least a wavering tone and an occasionally patchy plot. Set in the criminal underworld and boasting a vast array of smugglers, murderers, sabacc-cheaters and thieves, it's not surprising that betrayal is a central theme; however, the double and triple crossing also makes it hard to really care, especially as we know where a lot of the key players will end up. The action is decent enough, but fails to dish up any jaw-dropping moments. Weirdly, the colour grading is often so dim it's hard to fully appreciate the action sequences; the infamous Kessel Run an example of where our minds should've been blown, but the murky cinematography lessens its impact. Thankfully the film is given a much-needed boost by the sheer likeability of the cast; Alden Ehrenreich leading the way in the most difficult of roles. His Han is suitably cocky despite being prone to errors, an endearing combo for a rogue just starting out. Donald Glover has justifiably been lavished in praise for his fantastic performance as affable scoundrel Lando Calrissian, but Woody Harrelson and Emilia Clarke also excel as, respectively, Han's outlaw-mentor Beckett and arse-kicking long lost love Qi'ra. An adequate Star Wars flick that coasts by on the charm of its cast, but with a wobbly tone and a lack of memorable moments you can't shake the feeling it's a rather inessential entry into the franchise.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

We already have four great Han Solo stories in Episodes IV-VII. 
Is Solo a good in-between story? Yes, though it still feels unnecessary because we've heard and seen all this stuff referenced before in The Original Trilogy. Do we REALLY need a movie to further consolidate the fact that these things were canon in the first place? Alden Ehrenreich is a good Solo and Donald Glover is an even better Calrissian, and those two make up for the point-by-point prequel storytelling that the movie unfortunately gets dragged down by at times. 
'Han gets his gun, check.'
'The Millennium Falcon loses its thingy at the front, check.'

114,Richie-67-485852,Star Wars A Disney Saga,7,26 May 2018,"This movie is a must see if you are a fan but not because it is that good but only because it is a Star Wars movie and it joins the family and helps keep the main theme alive. It also proves that there can be literally no end to stories regarding Star Wars but with a catch. If they follow this formula, you will see the movies once but not again. Why? It has no memorable scenes. There is no comeback experience beckoning you like there was in the originals of which we couldn't wait to see and over and over again too. This movie is just a nice way to spend some time in the Star War Universe sorry to say. It struck me that they may take some of the segments and make some new rides out of them for Disney's Star Wars theme land or even use in Star Tours theme ride. I did enjoy the star of the movie who managed to capture the adventure aspect of it. Him and Chewbacca make a good team but need more of a storyline. I am a little surprised that Ron Howard could not make this movie more than it was considering his reputation, background and success. I certainly hope that as the Star Wars movies, parks, toys and all the rest continue that they will try to upgrade and give us some quality pictures instead of money-makers for Disney, the stars and their shareholders. This movie used some plot tricks, twists and included the famous music score at the right times to keep us tuned in but not enough to rave about. Two other things may make you wonder also. All those firefights and the main players don't get a scratch while people or creatures all around are dying is trying to watch as a viewer. The other item was that the millennium Falcon uses ""toggle switches"" yes the type that flip back and forth with long black plastic for your finger to navigate with. I find it hard to believe this tech would exist in a Galaxy far far away a long time ago that has spaceships, hyper drive, holographs and multiple life-forms.

115,classicalsteve,First and Foremost an Entertaining Episode in the Star Wars Canon,9,5 July 2018,"Stars Wars I-III (the prequels) failed largely because of the main fundamental flaw which is an accumulation of a host of other problems. Star Wars I-III basically failed to entertain. By contrast, Solo: A Star Wars Story definitely distracts us with a good solid piece of entertainment. When you strip away the hype, the stars, even the franchise, still, a film is supposed to entertain you. It's supposed to take you into another ""universe"" of sorts, which can be anything from a lake and beach house (as in ""On Golden Pond"") or the mythical world of Middle Earth. But being in the universe is not enough. A story with memorable and interesting characters must inhabit that universe, world, setting for two hours. If audience members start looking at their watches (as I did with Star Wars I: The Phantom Menace) the film has failed.While nothing will probably outdo the first two of the original series, ""Star Wars IV: A Good Hope"" and ""Star Wars V: The Empire Strikes Back"", especially with Harrison Ford, ""Solo"" will not disappoint. It's largely how Han Solo goes on his first interplanetary smuggling, meets Chewbacca and ends up with the Millennium Falcon. These last points are nothing new. Everyone who knows anything about Star Wars knows that these events happened in the past. because they are mentioned in other Star Wars films, but not in much detail. The question is how did these events in Solo's life unfold, and largely the present film answers how Solo became Solo.While no actor is going to top Harrison Ford as Solo, Alden Ehrenreich does a reasonable as the young Han Solo, presumably about 10 years younger than the character in the original Star Wars film, i.e. ""A New Hope"". (Harrison as Solo is probably in his late 30's). Without giving too much away, the story begins on an industrial factory planet where they manufacture star ships. From the get-go, we find out that Solo has already been doing jobs for the local mob boss. When he doesn't produce, he escapes with the help of his love interest Kira, and becomes a pilot and new recruit for the Empire. Fast-forward three years. He's now working for the Empire, doing menial jobs, such as overrunning helpless planets with other minions. Solo is no longer with the academy of pilots because of insubordination. He inadvertently falls into the company of Tobias Beckett (Woody Harrelson) who is part of a small band of smugglers and thieves who are posing as military personnel in service to the Empire. The only way Solo can see a way out is to join the band of thieves and help them pull off a big heist. His hope is to make enough money to buy his own star ship. But Beckett, his wife Val, and partner Rio Durant don't like Solo. They feel he is green and would be of no help in one of their heists. As a result he is thrown into the pit where resides a big human-devouring monster.A fun-filled action science fantasy film which keeps the spirit of the Star Wars franchise well-intact. One of its positives is it doesn't lapse into the device of having the characters ""run into"" other Star Wars characters, except one. And that one makes sense because Star Wars fans know that this film is how Han Solo and this other character meet. A very good film.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

For an orgins story, it was pretty good. I liked how Solo got his name and how he met up with Chewy. The rest not so much. It was because there were too many characters involved and too much convoluting plotting to see who was the rougest of them all. And, what was that short snippet of the Star Wars film that just seemed like it was just thrown in to remind us this is Star Wars y'all!

119,rockman182,Solo: A Star Wars Story (2018),7,28 May 2018,"I always look forward to a new Star Wars film. Obviously, in recent years we've seen a reawakening of these films and I've really loved it all. Solo went through a bit of turmoil getting made as the director changed a way into production. Ron Howard is a very hit or miss filmmaker, I haven't liked anything he made in the last decade (not counting that Beatles documentary because its impossible to mess that up). The Solo trailers grew on me as I watched more clips of it and I considered myself hyped for it. Its a good thing I don't care for what other established critics said about this film because I had an enjoyable time.The film follows a young Han Solo (Alden Ehrenreich) in his early days. Han is an eager but talented pilot who finds himself in a situation where he must deliver a super fuel called coaxium to an evil lord named Dryden Vos. He aligns himself with a a thieving man named Tobias Beckett, a former lover named Qi'ra, a furry companion pilot named Chewbacca, and a smuggler named Lando Calrissian. The film also stars Woody Harrelson, Emilia Clarke and Donald Glover as a young Lando.I'm very happy that this film didn't disappoint me. The film has such smooth battles, space chases, and action sequences. The CGI and effects all around look good here which makes it a joy to watch. I wasn't sold on Alden Ehrenreich as Solo when I first saw the trailer but I think he does a decent enough job. Bettany's Vos isn't really a unique villain and falls into a cliche of overbearing screaming villain. I don't think Emilia Clarke is a great actress but she's alright here. After all, lets not forgot how horrendous Natalie Portman was in the prequels. The sound effects and costume design is super as well.The film isn't as humorous as other recent Star Wars entries but I liked that. I think it was nice to see a young Han Solo, the troubles he got into, and how he came to be who he is. Of course, everyone and their mother is a fan of Donald Glover now but I've been a super fan of his since his Community days and his early Chlidish Gambino stuff. Liked him quite a bit as Lando. I don't know about a Lando stand alone film but I'm sure he can find his away into a future Star Wars anthology film.I read some critics really trashing this film. There's one (who I won't name) that loves to rate big budget films very lowly with and I'm starting to think its an agenda over him actually trying to enjoy or genuinely analyze what he sees. This film is not the best Star Wars film by any stretch. Its better than all three prequels and is a notch below Rogue One for me. Its not a perfect film, and could have used a stronger plot. Sure. The film still manages to carry that great Star Wars feel and provides non stop visuals, action, and adventure. Go there and stop expecting a storytelling masterpiece and you will enjoy this.7.5/10",Solo - A Star Wars Story
120,jon.h.ochiai,"Flying ""Solo""",7,28 May 2018,"Is ""Solo: A Star Wars Story"" a Disney cash grab? Yeah, pretty much. Is ""Solo"" worth seeing? Perhaps. Director Ron Howard took over completing ""Solo"" when original directors Phil Lord and Christopher Miller were fired by Disney half way through filming. Jonathan Kasdan and Lawrence Kasdan's screenplay tells the origins of ""Star Wars"" beloved younger Han Solo, played by Alden Ehrenreich. The Kasdan story occurs pretty much as unnecessary. Although darker and murky in context coupled with Ehrenreich's charming breezy interpretation ""Solo"" really misses deepening the emergent Hero Han Solo in the ""Star Wars"" mythology. Alden's good looks and smirking sense of humor lacks the gravitas of the selfish galactic thief's reluctant nobler persona. Mostly, his performance reveals the narrative failings of the story. Too bad. On the other hand, ""Solo"" has a gritty visual feel. The spectacular scene on the wintry planet with speeding monorail train to capture the prized fuel, coaxium, is breathtaking. Yet, we know that Han and Chewbacca, played by Joonas Suotamo, are never really in fatal peril. There is no authentic sense of danger in ""Solo"", because we know that Han will meet his fate much later in ""The Force Awakens"". As for dangerous, Ehrenreich lacks that edge that Harrison Ford possessed. This Solo is the ""bad boy"" wannabe. Han's thieving mentor is solid Woody Harrelson as charismatic Beckett. The grizzled Beckett's advice to young Han is: ""Assume everyone will betray you."" Nice. Now, that really inspires. Not. Much of ""Solo"" is the Hero's narrative mess. On the upside, I experienced that sense of wonder and nostalgia as Han, Chewie, and Lando Calrissian, played by amazing Donald Glover, race into hyper-drive making their legendary Kessel Run in the revered Millennium Falcon. Director Howard is best in his homage to the mythology. Although, he is often stymied with the ""Solo"" sequence in the ""Star Wars"" trilogies. Certain outcomes are predetermined. Apparently, young orphaned Han grows up in the Crime Syndicate community ruled by Lady Proxima, the Jabba the Hutt look-like creature voiced by Linda Hunt. Proxima leverages the children and younglings as potential thieves. Among them are Han and Qi'ra, bold beautiful Emilia Clarke, who is the love of Han's life. Han dreams of becoming a great pilot. He and Qi'ra plan their escape from the Syndicate. However, Qi'ra sacrifices capture for her lover's escape. 3 years later, Han is an Imperial soldier after dismissal from the Imperial Pilot Academy for insubordination. He befriends Beckett, played by Harrelson. Beckett sees the younger version of himself in Han. Beckett is beholding to a bond to Crime boss Dryden Vos, sublimely evil Paul Bettany. Han rediscovers Qi'ra, who is now herself beholding to Dryden. Han and Qi'ra are still in love. Perhaps, what restored my attention is their sweet love story. Of all the eye candy and galactic chases that has humanity. Although, Han doesn't see it, Clarke's Qi'ra sees ""the good man"" within. That maybe ""Solo""'s salvaging grace. Clarke gives heart to ""Solo"" amidst the flailing conspiracy and convoluted misdirects. She provides the sense of character and love. She also hints the intriguing surprise into the balance of the Force to come. ""Solo"" is completely unnecessary. It retains a sense of fun. ""Solo"" is the innocuous entertaining cash grab that celebrates nostalgia. Too bad ""Solo"" doesn't intend for the ambitious purpose as well.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
121,Benjamin-M-Weilert,An attempt to cash in on an iconic character's backstory.,6,8 March 2019,"Most superhero franchises start with an origin story. Sure, sometimes the franchise gets to this foundational plot after its first set of films (a la X-Men Origins: Wolverine (2009)), but these movies are usually pretty rare. Unfortunately, they're also hampered by the source material that preceded them. While not necessarily ""prequels,"" these films need to fit within the canon of the franchise while also telling a story that expands the canon as well. Star Wars is not a superhero franchise, but it has its fair share of prequels and origin stories. Solo: A Star Wars Story (2018) is the first to focus on a specific character, though.With Han Solo being such an iconic and fan-favorite character, there was plenty to pull from to expand out his backstory. Unfortunately, most people will only recognize Harrison Ford as the ""true"" Han Solo, and this film gives them some ammunition for that. Sure, Alden Ehrenreich does a passable job and looks like he could be a younger version of 1970's Harrison Ford, but there's still something missing in his performance. Even Donald Glover's Lando Calrissian is pretty good but is still just Donald Glover doing his best impersonation. I get that it's not logical to cast the original actors in these roles, but for fans who grew up with them, there's a particular power from the nostalgia that's difficult to overcome.What also hampers Solo is what I like to call the ""prequel checklist."" Essentially, every reference that Han Solo made in the original Star Wars trilogy is packaged up and crammed into this film. From the Kessel Run to how he obtained the Millennium Falcon, each set piece is meant to explain something that had only been a passing mention almost 40 years ago. All this being said, Solo is still a pretty fun film, filled with great visuals, a few original (and entertaining) characters, and a shocking reveal at the end. It's just that, if you went into this film with no knowledge of the source material, you'd likely be very lost.An attempt to cash in on an iconic character's backstory, I give Solo: A Star Wars Story 3.0 stars out of 5.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
122,RforFilm,"Solo: A Star Wars Story has ideas and impressive action scenes, it lacks a narrative that builds Han Solo as a character",5,29 May 2018,"SPOILER: It looks like we've gotten to a point in which Disney wants to explore parts of the galaxy that is Star Wars. So as side stories outside of the prequel, original, and current trilogies, where to they go? Anything connected to nostalgia of course! I'm aware that tons of Star Wars material has been produced (novels, video games, toys, cartoons, etc...) that have explored other planets and characters that don't even connect with the main story. Disney however wants to make sure that a mainstream audience will be just as curious and not want to stream too far. So when plans were announced for a Han Solo movie, people seemed mixed to the idea.Now Han Solo is not a bad character. In fact, he's a favorite for a lot of people. He's your typical cowboy scoundrel that's the definition of a real person in a science fiction. But with the original movies, you already get an idea of what this guy is and what his life was like before everything happened. That's not to say a Han Solo movie would be pointless. It would be interesting to see what made him in that manner and how is morals were set up. Let's see if Solo: A Star Wars Story can justify that. Set several years before A New Hope, a young Han (played by Alden Ehrenreich) is a slave-runaway on a shipbuilding planet where he dreams of escaping with his childhood friend/love interest Qu'ra (played by Emilia Clarke). Though he manages to get through the Empire's security, Qu'ra is captured and taken away. He vows to come back for her and enlists in the Empire's army in order to learn flying. His goal is to get good enough to get his own ship and fly wherever he wants.His time in the army helps him meet with Chewbacca and Tobias Beckett (played by woody Harrelson). Tobias is a criminal with his own group who offers Han and Chewbacca a chance to earn money in a train robbery. The mission goes wrong, and the group is forced to return to explain. This leads him to a local crime lord Dryden (played by Paul Bettany) who is won over by Han's persuasion to steal from another source. Han and Chewbacca receive assistance from a smuggler, Lando Calrissian (played by Donald Glover) who flies them in the Millennium Falcon to their next heist.What's a shame is that Solo: A Star Wars Story seems to have an idea that could have been great, but gets lost in the countless other stories trying to take off. To start off, though he's not my first choice, I think that Alden Ehrenreich does well as Han Solo. He may not look a lot like him, but he does a good job recreating Harrison Ford's mannerisms and his sauvé presence. Chewbacca and Emilia Clarke as Qi'ra are adequate. Like a lot of people, I too enjoyed Donald Glover as Lando. He has such a mysterious nature that makes him both intriguing and frightening. So if the characters and motivations are there, what's wrong?The story is whats the matter...or at least the latter part of it. At first, things go fine with Han getting off the planet, joining the army, meeting Chewbacca, and the train robbery. It's what happens afterwards that's the problem. Without spoiling anything, a character he was going to return home for shows up. While it's surprising, it makes you realize that the movie has nothing left for Han's emotional arc. Without his personal motivation to drive the story, everything remains on autopilot.From that point, your already aware of what's going to happen based on Han's personality from the original trilogy. I kept expecting something to happen to him, but what does alter the story is happening to the side characters like Qi'ra, Lando or Tobias. What does their actions and motivations have to do with how Han is shaped in the original trilogy? Does that make the movie completely boring? Not completely, as there are a fair amount of action sequences that not only echo the other Star Wars movies and even classic westerns in general. I guess it only matters what your expecting.I'll give this five Millennium Falcon ships out of ten. If your only going in for a passable Star Wars action movie, you'll probably get some enjoyment. But you really have to understand that everything that happens does little for Hans Solo as a character. While I have a bad feeling about this, it has it's moments.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
123,Holt344,"Solo is an underrated Star Wars film, a space western filled with memorable characters and action sequences - My Ultimate Review",9,4 May 2021,"Solo: A Star Wars Story is directed by Ron Howard and centers on the well known and iconic character Han Solo in his early days. During an adventure into the criminal underworld, Han Solo meets his future co-pilot Chewbacca and encounters Lando Calrissian whilst doing a job for Crimson Dawn with Beckett and his crew.The action sequences are great and entertaining, the train robbery are my favorite of them all. It has some true western vibes, it's a space western after all.Alden Ehrenreich stars in the title role. Woody Harrelson, Emilia Clarke, Donald Glover, Thandiwe Newton, Phoebe Waller-Bridge, Joonas Suotamo and Paul Bettany joins him in supporting roles. It's a cast filled with well known and talented actors, everyone does a phenomenal job. Alden Ehrenreich makes Han Solo his own with this terrific performance, he pays tribute to Harrison Ford but carries the film with ease with an charismatic and overall amazing performance. Donald Glover took over the role as a young Lando Calrissian, it's brilliant and I think Billy Dee Williams was happy how it turned out as he gave insight and advice on the role. The chemistry between Alden and Joonas or Han and Chewbacca is amazing.The sets locations and scenery is great, the costume department really went all in its impressive. The musical score is hopeful and powerful, it has some John Williams vibes but is its own thing. John Powell's score is one of the best parts of the film, simply brilliant.This will be my 4th time watching. The film had a problem behind the scenes, it's known. With Ron Howard taking on the project after the previous directors left or got fired. The lightning at times isn't very good mostly because it's too dark, but I mostly find the cinematography to be pretty good in this film. Camera work is impressive though. Another thing I disliked was the Droid, L3-37. I found her annoying and taking up too much space in the movie, but! The message and dialogue the character has and stand for is important in our world so I'm glad it's included but they could have reduced it. The film is flawed but overall a really good film that does what it strides to do, entertain us and give us fan service, my personal opinion is that they succeeded in bringing a backstory film to the big screen and it saddens me of the hate and low box office, I partly blame The Last Jedi for that but I think it was mostly because of fatigue of too many Star Wars movies.But what the producers wanted was to have a trilogy or just a couple of films that follows these characters and their story arcs. Solo, the film isn't all about action but also world building of the world of crime. Crimson Dawn who are the antagonistic group is also one of the biggest crime syndicates in Star Wars, too bad we won't see their plans see light. But with the new television series it might work out bit in a different way.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
124,petra_ste,Shockingly ok,7,11 June 2018,"Color me astonished that a Han Solo origin movie, in theory the most unnecessary thing ever, turns out to be... kind of fun? This cocktail between sci-fi, adventure, western and heist movie, despite a troubled production history with Ron Howard replacing original directors Lord and Miller, was far more entertaining for me than the critic-celebrated The Last Jedi.Alden Ehrenreich is fine as young Han, his chemistry with Wookie pal Chewbacca the best thing about the film. Woody Harrelson (as Han's mentor), Donald Glover (as Lando) and Paul Bettany (as a gangster) provide solid supporting turns. Emilia Clarke, one of the least effective performers in Game of Thrones, is also surprisingly serviceable as love interest Qi'ra.I have two main issues with Solo. One, comic relief droid L3 is obnoxious, annoying and unfunny - not quite Jar Jar Binks bad but in the same ballpark, the kind of secondary character which is to a story what a toothache is to a dinner. Second, this is the least impressive Disney Star Wars film in terms of visuals; cinematography and lighting are occasionally murky, probably the result of reshoots.Fanservice is admirably restrained... apart for a cameo near the end which I won't spoil but was the epitome of pointlessness. Replace *that* character with, say, the Emperor, and it would have been sort of cool rather than clunky and distracting. I was highly skeptical of Solo but the movie won me over; it's flawed and far from great but, after the disappointment of The Last Jedi, it reconciled me with Star Wars.7/10",Solo - A Star Wars Story
125,bankofmarquis,Surprised by how much I liked this film,8,29 May 2018,"I have a confession to make - I was surprised by how much I enjoyed SOLO: A STAR WARS STORY.Going into this film, I felt that this film had a few things going against it:1). Trying to replace Harrison Ford with another actor in the title role.
2). Bringing in Ron Howard to ""rescue"" the film.
3). Overcoming Star Wars ""fatigue"" from the less than enthusiastic response to THE LAST JEDI.And you know what? It has overcome these things - and more!Set sometime between Episode 3 and Episode 4 (and before ROGUE ONE), SOLO is, in essence, the origin story of everyone's favorite rascal, but is told in an interesting way - as a heist/caper film.Credit must be given to writers Lawrence Kasdan (THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK) and his son Jonathan Kasdan. They have developed a fast paced, twisty, back and forth con-man film disguised as a sci-fi film set long ago in a galaxy far, far away.Bringing in Howard was a good, competent move, for he moves the plot along sprightly and the special effects-laden chase sequences are tightly paced - if unspectacular - but they help move the action along - and doesn't get in the way. There is no ""special effects for special effects-sake"" sequences and Howard's workmanlike approach works well. He lets his strong cast strut on the screen with their strong characters which is wise of him for he inherited a film sprinkled with very good talent who looked like they were having fun with their characters. Start with Woody Harrelson as Solo's mentor. He provides a solid anchor to the proceedings. As does Emilia Clarke as Solo's best friend/love interest. She more than holds her own with Solo and Harrelson - and is as much a ""rascal"" as the other two.. Also providing a good turn is Paul Bettany as the main villain.As with most Star Wars films, the ""non-human"" continue to be interesting. Starting with Lady Proxima (voiced by Linda Hunt), followed by Rio Durant (voiced by Jon Favreau) and the robot L3 (voiced by Phoebe Waller-Bridge), all were interesting characters, rendered well.And...of course...there is Chewbacca (performed by Joonas Suotamo). I was thrilled to revisit the friendship between ""Chewie"" and Han. It was really easy to forget that you were watching a person in a Wookie costume. There is a rumor of a Chewbacca movie - and I'm all for it.Speaking of ""friendships"" - this film also explores the beginnings of the HAN SOLO/LANDO CALRISSIAN friendships - and Donald Glover almost steals the movie in his portrayal of Lando. He has the swagger, debonair (and slightly feminine) attitude of the character down.Which leads me to Alden Ehrenreich's performance as Solo. I have mentioned Harrelson...and Clarke...and Glover...and Bettany...and the CG characters...and Chewbacca...and this leaves Ehreneich's portrayal somewhat in the background. Don't get me wrong, he does a GOOD job as Solo, but - I feel - he just lacks the charisma and screen presence of the rest of them, and, of course, of Harrison Ford. He grew on me as the film progressed, but I felt he faded into the background at times - where he should have been up front.But...this is a quibble...in a film who's energy, pace and characters really worked for me - more than I thought it would.Letter Grade: A-8 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank (ofMarquis)",Solo - A Star Wars Story
126,Anurag-Shetty,A very predictable Star Wars film.,7,28 May 2018,"Solo: A Star Wars Story is set before the events of Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope(1977). Han Solo(Alden Ehrenreich) meets Chewbacca(Joonas Suotamo) & they go on an adventure that takes them to the criminal underworld of the galaxy far, far, away. Solo: A Star Wars Story is a good movie. Director Ron Howard has given us an entertaining standalone adventure, within the Star Wars universe. The visual effects are mind-blowing. The action set pieces are the highlight of the film. The major drawback of this movie is that, it doesn't bring anything new to the Star Wars franchise. You can predict how the story is going to go. Alden Ehrenreich just doesn't match up to Harrison Ford's unforgettable performance, as Han Solo. Joonas Suotamo is awesome as Chewbacca. Woody Harrelson is superb as Beckett. Emilia Clarke is spectacular as Qi'ra. Donald Glover is brilliant as Lando Calrissian. Thandie Newton is excellent as Val. Phoebe Waller-Bridge is effective as L3-37. Paul Bettany is impressive as Dryden Vos. Solo: A Star Wars Story is not a must watch. However, watch it if you're an ardent Star Wars fan. Just keep your expectations, relatively low.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
127,fernandoschiavi,"This film can be quite reasonable as a unique work, but that loses most of its strength if positioned as what it is: part of a pre-existing and well-consolidated universe",7,21 May 2020,"Two years after ""Rogue One"", the first derivative of the ""Star Wars"" franchise, which showed a group's suicide mission to obtain plans and learn about the vulnerability of the newly built Death Star, now finally wins its own spin-off and another facet of one of the main heroes of the Resistance against the Empire, Han Solo, previously played by the legendary Harrison Ford, is explored. This adventure takes place ten years before the events in Star Wars and explores the first adventures of Han Solo and Chewbacca, including the character Lando Calrissian.The pre-production of the film went through several difficulties. First, the duo Phil Lord and Christopher Miller were hired, but after four and a half months of filming and with a few weeks to go, the duo was fired by Lucasfilm on account of ""creative differences"". Lord and Miller believed they had been hired to make a comedy film, while the studio had hired them both just to add ""a comedic twist"". Lucasfilm also felt that the directors were encouraging actors to improvise, which was believed to be ""shifting the focus of the story"" from Kasdan's text. After the duo's resignation, Ron Howard was hired, who ended up taking on the remaining three and a half weeks of scheduled filming and another five weeks of reshoots, a fact that substantially raised production costs.In financial difficulty, pilot Han Solo (Alden Ehrenreich) and his girlfriend Qi'ra (Emilia Clarke) are looking for some work. They manage to get their hands on a valuable but dangerous substance, which eventually leads to the persecution of the Empire and the separation between the two. Worried, Han uses all his wits to infiltrate a risky plan, but one that may yield the opportunity to return to his homeland and find his beloved again. If he fails, he will have to give an account to the dangerous Dryden Vos (Paul Bettany). On the way, the pilot meets important partners, such as Chewbacca (Joonas Suotamo) and Lando Calrissian (Donald Glover), the original owner of the Millennium Falcon.Despite the problems during filming, we see that Ron Howard managed to fix the car with the wheels turning and delivered a film closer than Lucasfilm wanted. One of the most questioned points here is that the story did not actually bring anything new to the Star Wars universe, but that it is full of fan services. For anyone who is a fan of the intergalactic saga, it is very good to know the past of one of the icons and leaders of the Resistance against imperial forces. We can learn more about the life that Solo had on the planet Corellia and his desire to leave the site with his girlfriend Qi'ra, failing to survive with robberies. After the escape, we learned that Solo joined the Imperial Navy as a flight cadet to fulfill his great dream of becoming a pilot and after being expelled for insubordination, he became an infantryman in Mimban. From then on, the curiosity of many fans is satisfied when we learn how Solo met his faithful Wookiee companion named Chewbacca, how they both met Lando Calrissian and, even better, how they first came into contact with the legendary Millennium Falcon and how she became belong to Han. There are also mentions of Tatoinee (Luke Skywalker's planet), where they would go in the future and start working for Jabba, the Hutt, as smugglers. Even the Resistance, which was forming against the rotten Empire, is cited. All of these issues were addressed in the first Star Wars trilogy, but they had never been delved into, leaving only to the imagination of fans of the saga. And, for that matter, the film fulfills its mission.The new spin-off of the saga explores the origins of the smuggler immortalized on screen by Harrison Ford with a decent adventure, seeking to show how people living on the edge of the Empire survive in the galaxy. Solo is a forgotten on the planet Corellia and Chewie a prisoner of war. Basically, the screenplay Lawrence and Jonathan Kasdan tries to paint a scenario of renegades from the galaxy in an assault film, but is limited to answering questions about Han Solo's past - much, if not all, of them unnecessary, in addition to having moments uninspired. On the one hand, there is a certain courage to deny sabers, the Emperor, the salvation of the galaxy and many other themes explored in previous films. Part of the problem is the lack of intensity and weight in the action scenes.Harrison Ford's Han (even though the actor didn't like the character) had also built on the basis of the mystery. Therefore, bringing up that man's past and doing it with attempts at profound reflection not only dismantles the myth but also modifies it. His silent origins were an asset to his personality. Alden Ehrenreich surprises as the protagonist. Covered with an impossible task, which is to personify one of the icons of modern cinema and even if he is drowned by Howard's introspective incursions, the actor opts for simplicity and subtlety to revive Solo. The supporting cast is also composed by big names. The villain played by Paul Bettany has little screen time, but uses it well and intensely. Rio (Jon Favreau), L3 (Phoebe Waller-Bridge) and Beckett (Woody Harrelson) are the highlights of the Solo team, as well as Lando (Donald Glover), who is not surprising, but works in a decent way. The highlight is the robot L3-37 who steals the show with his veiled-but-not-so-much love affair with Lando, making Han's relationship with Chewbacca seem superfluous. She (the robot) is an example that demonstrates that there are always traces of creativity when created within the rich world of George Lucas.Director Ron Howard fills the screen with muddy environments and explosions all the time, while trying to explore new races to increase the possibilities of the universe created by George Lucas. What differs Howard's film for ""Rogue One"" is that the first one talks about a family formation, in addition to being much more fan service, while the Gareth Edwards film is a war feature and much more serious. In the first scene of the feature you can already feel the difference, the colors are more vivid, the gradation from orange to blue makes the film lighter, in addition to contributing to the plastic as a whole. CGI is well crafted, and the wealth of characters with a practical effect (fantasy) is quite showy. The variety that the Star Wars universe presents in its production and makeup design is wonderful. The problem, however, is to sin when giving identity and climax to Solo's journey. The filmmaker lacks agility in the pursuits, dramatic clashes and a sense of grandeur when filming the action sequences.It is the least grandiloquent film of all 12 released so far (with the two animations) and, although the adventures by Han give an ever progressive rhythm to the plot, there is a mixture of agility and contemplation that clashes with the universe. The script, which previously worked to present extraordinary figures, different worlds and heroes and villains of enormous dimensions, is given over to a banal adventure. If it weren't for John Williams' emblematic score (revisited by the competent and skilled John Powell) and the names and appearances of the main characters, it would feel like watching a generic film with the best quality visual effects. An entertainment that can be quite reasonable if it is considered as a unique work, but that loses most of its strength if positioned as what it is: part of a pre-existing and well-consolidated universe.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

129,joebloggscity,"Went in with a bad feeling about this, and came out feeling very pleasantly surprised!",7,16 June 2018,"I admit that i'm finding there to be quite a bit of fatigue when it comes to franchises. The superhero stuff is boring me mostly, but I've always had a soft spot for Star Wars and really enjoyed Rogue One. This is the second spin-off, and does it work? In my opinion it does without trying to be Star Wars but rather we have Indy in space as Han Solo!This action adventure is the roots backstory of Han Solo, that much loved rogue from the original trilogy, and we have a storyline that really does try to capture well the humour and spark of the main character. No jedis, light sabre fights and only the odd philosophy line (more just street level advice). So we have a stripped down ideal of Star Wars, a story based at the coal face of that universe as the rogues & hired guns make their way in an aimless world over by good & evil.Into all this steps Han Solo who wants to live on his wits and be a good pilot, thinking he's a bounty hunter & hired hand, really he's a 'good guy' and this dichotomy is the main gist of the film...... and I really enjoyed it. Sadly the film has come out as people have hit a low point with the series following disappointment with recent episode, and that has affected this one. That's a shame, as it's a great romp and a lower key entry in the whole universe.Forget what all else say. This has good characters, great humours and surprisingly a lead who fits in very well into the role, a hard task.Only real downpoint is that Emelia Clarke again shows what a limited actress she is. She's becoming a black widow for films as following Terminator and this series, she is struggling to find a life outwith of Game of Thrones, and even then that has hit a low of late in the penultimate season. Don't let that put you off, she's not key, and can be replaced in the next movies which I hope are madeThere is a lot of life in this series. I just hope it's given a further life on DVD & streams, and will create enough interest for the series to be built upon. Give it a try and enjoy it.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

After seeing it that was a pretty accurate summary.I'm somewhere half way on the line to being a star wars nerd. Whilst watching the episodes can't help but think whether the plot fits in with the overall series. If something doesn't fit though it certainly doesn't offend me. For those that don't know Solo is a story about Hans Solo in his early years. Alden Ehrenreich takes the role made famous by Harrison Ford and for the most part does a pretty good job. Love Emilia Clarke in GOT, but found her character Qi'ra slightly annoying.Ron Howard tends to go for style over substance and the story is never as interesting as Rogue One was a couple of years ago. The movie is pleasant enough and it's always nice to tick of the references to other star wars films. Especially liked the different take on the I've got a bad feeling about this line.

""Solo""'s okayness is its biggest problem. Harrison Ford had megawatt star power and his Han Solo immediately became an immortal screen hero. ""Solo"" can't fill those shoes or meet those expectations. The motto for a Han Solo movie must be ""Go big or go home."" In this case, moviegoers are staying home. Alden Ehrenreich is okay. He doesn't have the larger than life quality the role and the genre demands. You have to wonder why he was tapped for the part. You may be thinking, ""They don't make stars like that anymore,"" but they do. Donald Glover as Lando Calrissian; Woody Harrelson, as Han's mentor; Paul Bettany as a very scary villain; and Emilia Clark as a pretty girl with some surprises up her sleeve all appear to be the right cast member in the right film handing in the right performance.

This film as with the Last Jedi, ok some people loved, some liked, some didn't like and some hated. I don't hate either but I do ask myself why? Money, money, money but you can, as we say here in the UK ""FLOG A DEAD HORSE"" in other words you have to know when to stop. It seems Disney doesn't know when to stop and I personally think that by doing so they are doing the franchise no favours at all.

134,kjproulx,A Solid Landing for Such a MEssy Production,7,26 May 2018,"The Star Wars franchise isn't exactly in the best shape in terms of how fans have been reacting to the recent installment in Star Wars: The Last Jedi. Personally, I loved every chance that it took and it may be one of my favorites in the saga. So, if you're someone who just couldn't connect with that film on any level, then I feel your thoughts about this addition to the universe will be vastly off. That being said, I was still very hesitant on seeing Solo: A Star Wars Story, due to the fact that the production hit such a huge snag and it had the potential of being a giant, rushed mess. After seeing a few trailers this movie started to win me over and now that it's finally in theatres, my thoughts somewhat fall in the middle of every point I just hit. While Solo: A Star Wars Story doesn't do a lot to expand or give itself a purpose for existing, it's still an exciting time at the movies that I would recommend to fans, and here's why.The core plot of the first two acts is sort of a spoiler, so I will keep this brief. Solo: A Star Wars Story follows Han (Alden Ehrenreich) as he plans on returning to his home on Corellia, which is where many surprises lie for the movie. Getting caught up in the criminal underworld, joining a crew, meeting who will become a lifelong friend in Chewbacca, and encountering Lando for the first time, this film goes by in a flash. If there's one thing this film isn't, it's slow. For myself, I found it to have too much on its agenda to stop for anything. Sadly, that's only due to the fact that it was very streamlined and predictable throughout most of its duration.Yes, seeing all these characters on-screen together was amazing, but if you're a fan of this franchise, you'll find yourself coming up with predictions as the film progresses and most of them will probably come to fruition. The third act of the movie is about as predictable as it gets, but I will admit they at least found a way to make it an exciting ride. From betrayals to giant CGI action sequences, this movie definitely doesn't fall short in keeping the audience engaged. I personally just feel as though they didn't do enough to justify this film's existence. In order to win me over, it needed some great surprises and terrific performances that would make me believe I was watching these classic characters on-screen once again.The big question everyone has been asking is how Ehrenreich portrays the character of Han Solo and while I can't say he's a better fit than Harrison Ford was for this role, I can admit that I had a blast watching him from start to finish. He makes this character his own and that was enough for me. His charisma, along with the terrific supporting cast in Donald Glover, Emilia Clarke, and Woody Harrelson just brought it to another level for me. I truly felt like I was watching young Han interacting with young Lando and that was enough to put a permanent smile on my face.In terms of surprises, I can't really get into that here, but I'll say there are moments of genuine shock that filled my face. There are revelations that make their way onto the screen throughout the third act that had my jaw dropping, but then I was also thinking to myself that this is just a spin-off movie and they can't really do much from here unless they make a direct sequel. There are many issues I have with the ending of this film and when looking back, the conclusion just becomes more and more frustrating.In the end, Solo: A Star Wars Story presents a few surprises but really doesn't do anything new for the franchise. Aside from a terrific score that actually stood out as one of the better Star Wars scores over the last few years, and performances that truly made me smile, thinking I was watching these classic characters on-screen again, I simply don't know the reason this movie was made. Yes, it's a fine sci-fi adventure that everyone will likely be entertained with like I was, but that's about it. I don't have too many complaints, because it just decided to play it far too safe. I have to admit that I have a good time at the movies, but I never found myself impressed. Recommended for fans because it's absolutely not worth the hate and fan outcries it's receiving.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
135,kuarinofu,Solo? Occasionally. Star Wars? Yes. Story? No. / Humble Opinion,7,26 May 2018,"I had no expectations. I was not disappointed either. I'm not a hardcore fan, but I love the franchise (mostly the original trilogy and The Force Awakens occasionally).
My biggest problem with Solo is the Story. It felt not like a comprehensive character-based story (which it should have been), but rather a script written specifically to connect all the necessary dots, to hit all the points. Mil Falcon, Lando, the Kessel Run etc. This comes as expected since Disney is producing. They have very simplistic schemes when it comes to delivering to fans and wider audiences.
Another Disney's mark is the need to pack as much stuff in your movie as possible. 10 planets, 20 characters, 30 references and inside jokes and a lot of action scenes. Some of the action scenes are quite long as well. Never though I'd catch myself thinking ""Isn't this just a little long for an action scene?"" Kind throws you off when you are waiting for a long action scene to end so the movie can go back to developing actual characters, but all you get is some inside references and lots of technobabble. Most of the times the action just cuts abruptly, the characters sum up what happened and here we go again.
I'm not sure if that was intended, but there was zero chemistry between any of the characters (with an exception of Han-Chewie, I think, which was instant and had no build-up whatsoever). The forced love story was unbelievable and annoying. Nobody really related to anyone in any way. No clear motivations, no real emotions and thus - no character arcs. The movie ended but nothing has changed. It also doesn't help that they had to show (not introduce) lots of characters, but had no time to develop them, so they just had to deal with them quickly.
And yet this was still a well made movie from a technical standpoint. Great art direction, camera work, color correction, visuals. If only it had a little more substance behind all that. I mean, you can't just show the Millennium Falcon and play SW theme to get praised by the fans, it's a little more complicated than that. It's not Transformers fanbase we are talking about here.
To sum this up, I can only say that I think that A New Hope did more for Han as a character than Solo: A Star Wars Story...",Solo - A Star Wars Story
136,AhmedSpielberg99,This Movie By No Means Deserves The Hate It Got!,7,16 September 2018,"The fatal flaw this movie suffers from is that it gave priority to introducing the characters over introducing its main plot and setting-up its story and the world it take place in. This resulted in making me interested in almost each character, but this absolutely wasn't enough to make me care for them when they are in danger as much as I should. Case in point, the first battle in which I didn't feel the least threat to the characters. But the biggest problem here is that I was nearly lost in the story. I was having fun seeing the characters react and talk, especially because they all have great chemistry with each other, but that definitely isn't what a movie need to be good.Fortunately, the things got progressively better after the first act till this flaw completely diminished and then entirely disappeared. With that in mind, I became totally invested in the story as much as I was, and was still, invested in the characters.The battle scenes, and the action set-pieces don't seem fresh or new, and that's exactly what made them so much fun to watch. Ron Howard shot the action sequences in a very classical way, and that's made me feel as I was watching one of the original trilogy's movies. That was very nostalgic!
Almost every scene that takes place inside the Millennium Falcon is staggering! Notably, the long battle scene that appeared in the movie's trailer. This scene is my favorite scene in the entire movie; it is a very intense scene that put me on the edge of my seat, add to that it showcases how terrific the chemistry between our main characters is. Ron Howard's vision of the Millennium Falcon is really looks fresh.The action isn't the only thing in Solo that feels old-fashioned, but that applies to almost every aspect in this movie, most notably the denouement of the plot. The plot has classic plan that has plenty of back-to-back twists and turns near the end of the movie. Most of them worked pretty well, and I really was fooled many times, except the last one that was downright dull and stupid.Alden Ehrenreich did a great job as the titular character. It's not like he was the only choice to play Han Solo, but he did his best embodying the character, and walked the fine line between coolness and imprudence that I couldn't help but imagine Harrison Ford's face watching him In action. In addition, Han's scenes with Chewbacca are magical as always.
I was worried about Emilia Clarke playing a Star Wars character, simply because I'm not a big fan of her, but she really proved that I was wrong just at the first scene she was in, and I found myself related to her character very fast.
Woody Harrelson is fantastic as always, and had a great chemistry with every actor he appeared with. Also, I loved his character. I think it has some depth, and that's the case with all the main characters.
Donald Glover just nailed it as Lando! He has an unparalleled charisma that really suits his character pretty well that I can't imagine any actor except him playing this role.
But there is one particular character, and one particular performance that really got my attention, and standed out for me. The performance is Thandie Newton's as Val. Her character has a very small role in the movie, but Thandie Newton took this character to another level, and made it one of the most interesting side characters in the movie.
As for the side character that I loved so much, it's the stubborn droid, L3-37. She was a scene-stealer with her funny lines and jokes that are rarely miss, and Phoebe Waller-Bridge's vocal performance was impeccable!Speaking of the humor, unlike The Last Jedi, this movie didn't try too hard to make its jokes funny. The purpose of the humor here is to keep the movie light-hearted, instead of making us laughing. That being said, most of the jokes worked well for me, especially those which cane from the comic relief character,L3-37 as I mentioned above. To be honest, there are a couple of jokes that fall flat for me, not necessarily because they aren't funny, but because the timing of these jokes was very imprecise, and they didn't match the tone in some particular times.The visual and sound effects are top-notch as any recent Star Wars film. So I hope the movie gets an Oscar nod in at least one of these categories like every Star Wars movie so far.Overall, I enjoyed Solo: A Star Wars Story so much, and I wasn't expecting that at all. It's a fun old-fashioned fast-paced action flick that can satisfy any one who wants to watch an entertaining movie while having some popcorn. (7/10)",Solo - A Star Wars Story

138,Carycomic,A surprisingly refreshing prequel.,10,25 May 2018,"And, let's face it: a lot of Star Wars fans needed refreshing after the minor disappointment of Supreme Leader Snoke being killed off so early in THE LAST JEDI!* That refreshement comes in the form of a new actor playing an old fan favorite (the relatively unknown Alden Ehrenreich as twenty-something Han Solo); the introduction of all new characters, such as Lady Proxima (a crooked Priapulin?) and Dryden Vos (a sadistic crew-cut Firrereo?); and the much-anticipated first meeting between Han, Lando Calrissian, and the Millenium Falcon. Probably the biggest romantic triangle in the SW franchise! Sadly, there are no comedy relief droids in this prequel. Especially not in the case of L-3, Lando's female-voiced navigator droid (who's apparently trying to organize a droid-lib movement, single-handedly, while simultaneously sporting a crush on her ""owner""). So, most of the comedy relief comes from Donald Glover as Lando, himself, as he narrates a holovid diary about his past exploits (thereby rendering them officially canonical, as opposed to ""Legends"").  True! Attendance was a little sparse, at the matinee showing I went to see at my hometown multiplex. But, hey! It's still just the opening day of Memorial Day weekend. I'm sure there will be longer lines for the evening shows. So, go see SOLO with a clear conscience. I wasn't disappointed in it. And I trust that none of you will be, either.*I am not shouting.

I imagine all the major characters will get the same treatment.

141,msbreviews,Rating: C+,5,25 September 2018,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)Like almost everyone, I am a huge Star Wars fan. I love the original trilogy, and Han Solo is definitely one of my favorite characters of the entire saga. Harrison Ford elevates this character to a whole other level, and it marked his career as one of his most iconic roles. I wasn't in need of an origin film about Solo, but I also didn't exactly craved for Rogue One, and it genuinely surprised me, by risking its success on bold narrative decisions that changed everyone's interpretation of the other installments.However, every franchise-related movie has a common issue: a massive fandom, who are going to either love or hate the film, there is never a middle ground. Another problem is how people analyze this type of movies: you can't look at a prequel/sequel/reboot/remake/whatever in the same way that you look at a standalone, saga-unrelated flick. You need to acknowledge the other installments and their events. Finally, the expectations need to be realistic. Despite the original trilogy being a tremendous and classic success, it doesn't mean every other installment must be as mind-blowing.Therefore, my expectations for Solo: A Star Wars Story were that it would be able to develop this famous character even further while telling a compelling and entertaining story. It does some things right, but it also does a lot of things wrong. It is the best definition of an ""okay"" film that I can get from this year. One that, even though I'm not giving it a positive review, I'm sure I'm going to watch it again someday. So, let's start with the pros ...Entertainment-wise, I can't deny the action sequences are riveting and extremely captivating. As expected, they are incredibly well-made and Ron Howard, even though he had to deal with tons of production issues, is able to stitch everything together and direct the hell out of this movie. Basically, almost every story that we heard Harrison Ford's Han tell in the OT is depicted in this film, from the Kessel Run in 12 parsecs to how he got the Millenium Falcon from Lando Calrissian (Donald Glover).Technically, excellent cinematography, beautiful set designs, and great editing. The CGI is very well-applied, and it never becomes overwhelming, giving those Star Wars visuals effects that everyone loves and praises. The pacing is also adequate, even if sometimes it feels a bit too fast, jumping from an action set piece to another consecutively without any time to breath. Tonally, it is fine. It loses a bit of its balance when it tries to insert some comedy, but nothing significant.The biggest standout is the cast. Emilia Clarke (Qi'ra) surprisingly shut me up and proved that she can also belong in a major movie franchise, like Star Wars. Don't ask me why, but I never felt that she was the right choice to portray a character from this saga. I love her in Game of Thrones, but something was off every time I imagined her in the Star Wars universe. She is one of the best parts of the film, delivering an emotional and impressive performance.Donald Glover continues his streak of turning everything he his involved with an instant success. He incorporates Lando in such a remarkable way, making his character extraordinarily captivating and giving me precisely what I expected Lando to be. Woody Harrelson is also great as Beckett, an accomplice to Solo's adventures, as well as Thandie Newton as Val. Paul Bettany doesn't have much to do as Dryden Vos, but he still gives his best to portray this sort of ""villain."" Chewbacca is, of course, awesome as always.Unfortunately, the only one who truly needed to shine and didn't was Alden Ehrenreich as Han Solo. Not that he doesn't deliver or ruins the character. He is just ... Fine. This is my biggest compliment and at the same time my biggest criticism of the whole movie: it doesn't ruin anything. It doesn't risk its success by trying to change anything related to Star Wars. It doesn't influence any other installments with some sort of narrative decision. But most of all, it doesn't try to develop Han in any way.It is not Alden's fault that his performance feels an imitation. After all, they couldn't really change much about his display since this character is already created and appears in four films. The big issue is in his script. It is an attempt at imitating something without giving it any layer of creativity or originality. Naturally, comparisons have to be made, and while they nail some aspects of Ford's performances, they also fail in showing a few of Han's most distinct traits.My main problem with his movie is that it doesn't feel like one. It is just a compilation of action sequences sewed together and a few other scenes to fill in the blanks, with no real plan or main plot to follow. It feels like they went over the OT installments, they registered every Han's story, filmed them and then created the rest of the story. The relationship between Han and Qi'ra is the best subplot of the film, and there is barely any time to develop that because there are tons of action set pieces to show.As I wrote above, I was genuinely entertained by them. However, there are no real stakes or emotional weight to any of them. The first half of the movie is aimless, with no main thread to guide our focus and when finally they decide to tell us what's going to happen next, they use obvious foreshadowing, making the end of the film predictable even before the beginning of the third act. Dryden, who supposedly is the villain, is hardly rememberable because he is barely on screen.I believe that the production issues and the constant change of directors damaged the way the screenplay is handled. I love Ron Howard's work, and I think he did the best to correct everything and try to deliver a good story, but some things were already due to failing. The predictability of the third act turns it a bit boring and even anti-climactic. So, I will end this review addressing the three main points of its beginning.I don't love or hate this movie, I just think it is okay (don't kill me, please). Since the character of Han Solo was already established, the limits of what they could have done were not huge, but the lack of risk and consequently the lack of character development reduce this film's influence. Watching the OT now, you will understand better the relationship between Han and Lando, but even considering that, you really don't have any significant impact in any other installment or on Han's persona. Finally, as I expected, it didn't disappoint me, but it also didn't surprise me. It is just a movie, probably just made to make some money.All in all, Solo: A Star Wars Story is just okay. As any franchise-related film with a huge fandom, it is always going to get a lot of love and hate. Ron Howard did the best he could, and technically I only have compliments to give him, from the terrific action sequences to the beautiful set designs and VFX. Emilia Clarke surprised the hell out of me, Donald Glover is amazing as Lando and the rest of the cast is great for the most part, but Alden Ehrenreich, maybe due to his script, feels like a cheap imitation of Harrison Ford. The biggest issue is the screenplay, which feels a collection of continuous adventures, glued together with no real stakes or a main plot to drive them. The character of Han doesn't get any major development diminishing this movie's influence, which is almost none. In the end, have fun with the action set pieces. After all, that's where the money was spent.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
142,anselmdaniel,A perspective on Star Wars,6,5 December 2020,"This review contains spoilers.Solo: A Star Wars Story is a stand-alone movie that tells the story of Han Solo before Star Wars: A New Hope. The story begins with Han Solo having a criminal career at Corellia and follows his famous Kessel run in the Millenium Falcon. Along the way, familiar faces of Chewbacca and Lando Calrissian become involved in the story.Solo: A Star Wars Story is a generic movie. The story has a great setting and interesting characters. It was great to see a Star Wars story that did not have Jedis, the Force, or lightsabers. The story here concerns criminals and the Star Wars setting. This is a refreshing take on Star Wars as the criminal setting was never explored thoroughly before. I enjoyed this part of the story. The story did feel like it was restrained by the requirement that it had to follow Han Solo. The story had to tell the history of Han that was mentioned in the Star Wars original trilogy. if the story was not about Han Solo and it was instead about new criminal characters, the story could have been more creative and unpredictable.The story had to make callbacks to the original trilogy and it could have been better telling an all new story. For example, a reveal with Qi'ra and Darth Maul at the end was cool, but it felt hollow as it seemed nothing could be followed up. This seemed like a reveal only to make a call to the prequel trilogy rather than trying to make a new legacy. The movie also felt too dark in its cinematography which detracted from its images and scenes.Solo: A Star Wars Story is an acceptable chapter in the Star Wars franchise. Do not go into this movie expecting something unpredictable or creative.Grade: C",Solo - A Star Wars Story

The rest of the movie is slow and dull. There are a few deaths that nobody seems to even be bothered by after the fact. What? The dialogue is long winded and uninspired. The bad guy is zzz.

146,MrDHWong,"As a regular sci-fi action film, it's an adequate experience, but as a Star Wars film, I say take it or leave it",7,31 May 2018,"Solo: A Star Wars Story is a spin-off film based on the Star Wars character Han Solo. Directed by Ron Howard (A Beautiful Mind, Frost / Nixon), it is a fun sci-fi adventure film for uninitiated viewers of the franchise but an unessential film for veteran fans.Several years before the events of the original Star Wars trilogy, young orphan Han Solo (Alden Ehrenreich) tries to survive by any means possible on the dangerous world of Corellia. One day, Han is forced to abandon his life on Corellia to join the Imperial Empire as a soldier, where he meets Tobias Beckett (Woody Harrelson), a criminal who takes Han under his wing to help him pull off death-defying heists.While the film could serve as an ideal entry point for Star Wars newcomers who don't wish to start with the original trilogy, there is very little reason for older fans to see Solo: A Star Wars Story. Only the occasional inside reference and character trait may keep older fans invested in what is going on. The film suffers from tonal shifts and darkly saturated visuals, which do not gel together and become distracting during what should be lighthearted moments. This is likely due to the change in directors from Phil Lord and Christopher Miller over to Ron Howard during the film's production stages. Despite this, most of the cast do a fine job in their roles, including Alden Ehrenreich in the titular role, who actually does resemble Harrison Ford from certain angles. However, it is Donald Glover as the young Lando Calrissian who stands out the most not only due to his strong physical resemblance to the original actor Billy Dee Williams, but also in his near-perfect mimicry of Williams' voice and mannerisms. In addition to this, the film does have some exciting action scenes from time to time and some convincing practical effects, harkening back to the days of the original trilogy. As a regular sci-fi action film, it's an adequate experience, but as a Star Wars film, I say take it or leave it.I rate it 6.5/10",Solo - A Star Wars Story
147,Alexander_Blanchett,A film that justifies Han Solo,8,28 May 2018,"I really liked it. The film deserves a better reputation that it has. It is a fun story with fun characters and many little fun twists.
The clue of the film is that Alden Ehrenreich is perfectly cast in the lead role of Han Solo. An iconic character that was brought to life and legend status by Harrison Ford. Ehrenreich nails that role because he perfectly adapts the same characteristics, charms and charisma which made Ford's Solo so iconic. Great performance. Also Donald Glover was perfectly cast as a young Lando Chalirssian although I hoped they would have developed him and his relationship with Solo a bit more. But this was just one of a few minor errors that held the film back from being a real masterpiece. The story was good, pretty basic but totally justifies a film about Han Solo. It was like a crime western in a way. From the rest of the cast it is Woody Harrelson that stands out the most as Solo's sort of mentor. While Emilia Clarke was only mediocre and didn't do much for the film. Paul Bethany made a solid villain but also a bit too basic at times. Thandie Newton was okay but a bit wasted.
I really liked Ron Howard's direction and approach to the story, however I wonder what Phil Lord and Christopher Miller would have done with the material. Another great aspect of the film was the fantastic action, great visuality and a wonderful original and adapted score. It did have a lot of fun factor but also some lengths. It justifies the character Han Solo and that was the most important thing. I dont need a sequel or anything but it was a good way to bring us this character and also his famous friendship with Chewbacca closer.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
148,CANpatbuck3664,A Fun Sci-Fi Heist Flick When Viewed Independently From the Star Wars Saga,8,28 May 2018,"Solo: A Star Wars Story boasts one of the more inventive plots I've seen lately. They play with Han's story and aren't afraid to take it some unexpected directions (at least for those just familiar with the movies and haven't researched to extended continuity of the franchise). One of the small problems I had with Solo was while the movie does have some intriguing ideas and exciting sequences, they reside in the middle of the movie. The bookends of this movie (beginning and end) are the weakest with all the best stuff in middle hour and a half. This isn't a major flaw, but I had to be patient for it to get going and the finale felt a little rushed.After the news of Alden Ehrenreich needing some extra help to get the character of Han Solo, I wasn't sure he could capably perform in the lead. He caught me completely off guard, he was great as Han Solo. He's not Harrison Ford (and no one could have matched him as Han), but he has the charisma, the toughness and the comic timing and I think he pulled it off. He bounces off Joonas Suotamo (who plays Chewbacca) well and I thought he also had good chemistry with Emilia Clarke who played his love interest Qi'ra. Clarke did well, her performance as Daenerys is still better but this was a step in the right direction. She's had trouble getting off the ground when it comes to acting in movies and this will hopefully be that stepping stone for her. Donald Glover does a fine Lando impression, there was a lot of praise for his version of this character and I largely share those sentiments. Woody Harrelson is solid as Beckett, he's appropriately slimy but he invites you in enough that you want to believe in him. Thandie Newton is good for the limited time we get to spend with her. I also liked Paul Bettany, but he was kneecapped by his character.I would put this in the heist movie genre but there are a couple of big action set pieces. Despite the troubled production, they were actually pretty great. Between the fight on the train and the escape/heist from the spice mining planet are both excellent. I didn't have a problem with the ending fight for the action choreography and even that bit had its moments. They pack the thrills and there were some unexpected outcomes for that little extra payoff. If anything, Solo proves you don't have to have a lightsabre duel to keep audiences on the edge of their seat.My problems with Solo: A Star Wars Story boil down to 2 things. The first is that Bettany's character of Dryden Vos is a weak villain and although the ending boasts a couple of unique twists, its undercut by the lack of a real threat. Bettany's a great actor and they gave him a decent backstory, but a surprise betrayal comes in the 3rd act and instead of getting 2 sinister threats, we end up with none. The second is that Solo feels somewhat clunky or as if the movie is being too obvious when it brings in iconic items for Han or connects to the larger Star Wars universe. Solo works best when it operates as its own story, the seams only start to show when you really examine how it fits in the original timeline or when characters from other movies cameo.I expected very little from this movie. I already mentioned all the bad press the movie got and while I went into this movie open-minded, the negativity surrounding Solo did lower my expectations accordingly. While it's far from perfect, I had a lot of fun with this movie. Between the taught pace, the solid acting from the cast and the infectiously happy vibe the movie boasts, I was swept up in it. It doesn't nail every aspect, but it gets far more right than it doesn't and I'm not going to drop it down to a 4 or a 5 because of some nitpicks. My actual rating for Solo: A Star Wars Story is somewhere between an 8-9/10 but I'll go with an 8/10 to be safe.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

While it tried a bit TOO hard to make nostalgic references/connections to the Lucas cinematic universe, it also managed plenty of enjoyable action and double crosses along the way. That's really all I wanted and expected. (Ehrenreich was a fairly large part of that success, honestly - he managed to capture Han's essence without ever doing a Harrison Ford impersonation.)

But Disney and Lucasfilm should be careful with what they produce, otherwise the results will be disappointing as ""Solo"" in the box office and with the critics. Personally I loved solo, it was a fun ride but it doesn't quite feel like a star wars movie. So maybe this means a new path for star wars movies: exploring new stories that don't need to be exactly like the originals but can ""break the rules in star wars"", creating new stories that are unique. Maybe a han solo movie was not on people's minds but it does give an opportunity for more creative stories. Alden Ehrenreich, Emilia Clarke, Woody Harrelson and Paul Bettany are great actors.

Truth is, I don't even bother to read them now. Simply put, you can't trust them. I've written about 30 reviews on IMDb. Out of all of those reviews, I've only written one 10/10. No one believes this film is better than the original Star Wars, so to call this a 10/10 means you're either a bot or paid. Anyway, onto the film itself. This film is ok, but it's also a film 'just by the numbers' and that makes it bland. We need this..tick. Now we need that..tick. And so on. A good film = a strong story, and a good script. It also needs natural dialogue. Some of the dialogue in this film is downright awful. You can tell the actors are simply reading lines because it's written poorly. The plot doesn't flow smoothly; it's just crowbarred in. ""We need this to happen so that can happen = Crowbar it in now."" CLANK. Apart from Woody Harrelson, who is an excellent actor, the rest of the cast act pretty badly. Finally, the female robot is lame, and the story is about 20 minutes too long. So yeah..10/10?

160,cultfilmfreaksdotcom,Don't Blame Old Luke (Last Jedi) On Young Han's SOLO Travesty,1,7 June 2018,"On an endless, meandering, dizzy and complicated, uninteresting cycle, one scene follows the next with zero substance or flow along the way. It feels like starting from the proverbial ceiling and dropping to the floor, again and again: New rooms, new ceilings, new floors... But no doors: An adventure needs to move across, horizontal, sideways, and throughout its foundation. SOLO is a tortuous, unending pogo stick. A hangover without drinking.How Alden Ehrenreich was cast in the first place is unbelievable. Reportedly, it was from a big critical splash (that no average moviegoer even knew about) as a result of the Coen Brothers' HAIL, CAESAR where he played a bad actor trying to fit into what's supposed to be a great film: A limited performer in way over-his-head. Talk about Life Imitating Art. But the poor kid didn't have a chance, nor would even a great actor who actually resembled Harrison Ford and/or channeled him correctly. The SOLO: A STAR WAYS STORY screenplay is almost entirely to blame...Lawrence Kasdan, who scripted George Lucas's stories for EMPIRE, RETURN and RAIDERS, and his son, Jonathan, had no idea what type of fantasy they were creating. Part Space Pirate, part Buddy Picture, part Action/Adventure, part Comedy, Part Western, Part Chase: all enveloped into a preachy melodrama involving the slave labor of children, teenage girls, and even robots (Set Your Blenders Free!)...The Kasdans had no vision. Instead, they only seemed to ""Have a dream."" But that kind of force-fed melodrama is, at this point, tiresome, cliché. In SOLO, the message kicks the viewer in the face and doesn't let up.As for the box office, SOLO bombed on the opening weekend, which means audiences didn't care. And it continued (and still continues) to plummet: most likely due to people hearing bad news about what they already figured, feared, or expected. And this is terrible news for Disney. Their planned Boba Fett and Obi Wan prequels are now under a looming shadow: plus the fact George Lucas already covered those particular backstories in his rightfully maligned prequels...And in this case, hardcore fans, and even mainstream audiences, didn't need a reason for Han Solo to be anything but the character he was in the Original Trilogy where Harrison Ford's performance felt both effortless and driven, leaving no time to reflect upon a life that led to a position of needing to move forward beyond what he was hired for i.e. what he does is who he is...And while the significance of Han, Chewbacca and the Millennium Falcon obviously stretches beyond giving the young hero a ride to rescue a princess, they still exist to fill-in the ""now"" while Mark Hamill's often-thankless Luke Skywalker (along with Obi Wan and Leia) are left to suffer through the how's and where's, and especially the whys. What Harrison Ford brought to the character was a pointed, focused, glib and mischievous persona that is still involving, addictive, and timeless. Basically, SOLO: A STAR WAR STORY attempts (badly) to provide answers that the legendary Rebel's Rebel didn't need, or ask for. Bottom line: Han Solo never looked back...

I don't get the hate for the actor who plays young Han Solo(Alden Ehrenreich), sure he is not Harrison Ford, but who is? And to me his behavior and interactions with other characters in this seem a lot like what young Han WOULD do! He carries himself with this arrogant smile and (fake)confidence you'd expect! Others do a great job, Harrelson is great as always, Clarke is good and Glover steals the show as Lando! The movie itself is mostly fast paced, full of action and has quite a lot of cool moments and a few cool references. There are some twists and turns also, this can both be good or bad depending on who you are.. Overall it bridges the gap between Episode 3 and 4 even further quite nicely, showing the Empire bringing ""peace and prosperity"" to the galaxy and their recruiting propaganda..

162,dfle3,Lots of coincidences & convenient story elements but not a bad Star Wars prequel. 67.5+,7,15 June 2018,"Alden Ehrenreich does a decent job of playing Han Solo in this prequel to Star Wars, Episode IV: A new hope. There are many moments when he displays glimpses of Harrison Ford like looks, which is good, for those who remember Ford's original turn as Han Solo. One time I detected a flash of Jack Nicholson in Ehrenreich's looks, and there seemed to be just a touch of Val Kilmer to his physical appearance as well. Overall, the film has an amiable, good-natured quality to its origin/heist-like story, although it isn't particularly funny, which is not intended as a criticism. Having heard that the two original directors of this film were fired because they were tending to have improvised comedy on the set, it would have been interested to see what kind of film they would have released, had they not been removed by the studio. Their replacement, Ron Howard, seems to have done a serviceable job in finishing this film, although I'm not sure how the boundaries with the earlier directors was drawn. The story concerns the origins of Han Solo and leads immediately up to the events of the first Star Wars film (Episode IV!). We get to learn of Han's background as young (child?) and how he came to be the pilot-for-hire with a dodgy background in the original Star Wars movie. We also learn how he got his name, how he came to be with Chewbacca, his Wookie partner-in-crime and how he came to have possession of the Millennium Falcon spaceship. There's a little bit of romance in this film as well. It seems to me that if the original Star Wars trilogy gave some biographical information about Han or people he knows, this film gives the backstory to it. It seems to me that a major loose end to this film is what happened to the relationship between Han and his love interest in this film...perhaps I am forgetting some reference to this in the earlier sequels (!) but I doubt it.  Perhaps a mild criticism of this film is how it is an exercise in joining these dots between references in the original trilogy and their backstory here. It just seems very short and sharp. For instance, watching the original Star Wars film, I might have imagined that Han and Chewbacca had been partners in crime for many years. At a guess, it seems like they only knew each other for maybe a few weeks, which seems unnecessarily short.  As for Han's backstory, I did get confused when his father was mentioned...it seemed at odds with his implied time 'indentured' (so to speak), with a creature who 'cared' for children. Perhaps there were references to earlier films (or characters) which I missed...or maybe not. For instance, if you liked Lando Calrissian in Episode V, this prequel perhaps expands on the lore from that earlier film. No doubt viewers familiar with the earlier films will have some satisfaction tying the two films together.  It wasn't just with the Star Wars universe that I joined the dots, so to speak. A couple of sequences involving a game played between Han and Lando did put in mind the James Bond films' preoccupation with a certain game. Perhaps intended to be the most exciting part of the film for fans of the lore of the earlier films, is the depiction of Han's Kessel run in 12 parsecs. Now, I have come across criticism of franchise creator George Lucas' use of that phrase, suggesting that he got the phrasing wrong. However, I did come across an article some years ago, perhaps by a blogger or something, which rationalised the phrase as being meaningful, even though critics thought it misapplied. I'm happy to go with that rationalisation. In any case, this sequence features a ridiculously sized monster...which reminds me of...was it the first film in this franchise, Episode IV? It's hard to rationalise a monster so big being so interested in something the size of gnat...relatively speaking. As mentioned in my headline, there are a lot of coincidences and convenient plot points to this film. E.g. Han's father just happened to work on...Han just happens to have been able to speak such-and-such a language...and Han having conveniently flown a...before.  Having heard that the box office take for this film was a disappointment, as far as film reporters go (or perhaps the studio executives too?), I'd say that that doesn't make this a bad film. Generally these ""A Star Wars story"" stories have been entertaining enough and more entertaining than films in the main series too...especially Episodes I and II!Random observations:Linda Hunt gets credited as the voice of such-and-such a character in the closing credits. Not sure if that is the Oscar winning (?) actress from that film with Mel Gibson...was it ""The year of living dangerously""?* How many more of these ""A Star Wars story"" stories are in the pipeline? Perhaps the box office for this one might mean that none are?* I was thinking of scoring this film 65% and giving it 6 stars out of 10...but it's likeable enough to get the little bump in score...and stars.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
163,sweidman-28016,Not Great but Ok,7,28 October 2018,"Solo: A Star Wars Story ReviewSolo is the unneeded origin story of the beloved Star Wars character Han Solo. I was never really excited about it in the first place so I went in with lower expectations. The movie was ok. Nothing great but not bad. I wanted more in a Star Wars movie because it's one of the best anthology movie series ever made. I'm just going to go straight to the flaws first and end with the positives. First off, Alden Ehrenreich was not a Han Solo. He didn't have the charisma, didn't sound like him, somewhat looked like him, and just wasn't that fun. That was my biggest flaw for it. I didn't really like the plot for the movie. It seemed generic and very predictable. The character of Qi'ra was not a good character. She was just there to add a side plot backstory and make problems. The droid, L3-37, was a funny character but literally everything she said had to be funny and it got old fast. The score was fine except some pieces didn't fit and didn't sound like a Star Wars score at all. Finally, and this scene they decided to put in there really made me mad, there was a scene referencing the prequels. The scene either means they're going to make another movie or they just really wanted to screw up the timeline of everything. Now let's move onto the pros. Donald Glover was perfect as Lando. Woody Harrelson was great. And that's really it for characters that I liked. There were some fun scenes that reminded me of the classic Star Wars movies. The action was good, except I don't recall seeing any light sabers. The humor was good and made people laugh. It wasn't a horrible movie. It was entertaining. A bit disappointing for a Star Wars film, but I didn't expect much. That's all I can really say about the film. It's not a must see but I'd see it if you're a true Star Wars fan.My Grade: B-My Top Star Wars Movies:

It's great to see a young Han Solo on the screen though, and nobody does Sci-fi better than Star Wars. Chewbacca had probably his biggest and best role in all of the movies. Aside from one minor surprise cameo, this movie was pretty much what I expected. I would have liked more cameos, and definitely could have used more laughs. I wonder if the original directors would have had more comedy.

Logically Harrison Ford is too old to revisit this role in his more youthful days. Then to add insult to injury they have not Billy Dee Williams playing Lando.
Then the more logical part of my mind took over and said ""You liked the Star Trek reboot movies right? Well give this a shot."" So I did. While I struggled with getting past the replacement of two people that, as a kid I idolized, I eventually made the leap and found myself enjoying this movie.

They basically hired Chris Kattan to play Han Solo.It's just so painful to watch and all my good memories of the original Star Wars destroyed.The other characters were so unbelievably bad and poorly developed.

Could that be the case with the Star Wars franchise?
After all ever since Disney got their mitts on the property they haven't been shy in bombarding us with content from a galaxy far far away...Solo is a good movie, not a great one, it's no Empire Strikes Back but it is a solid attempt at telling us a story we never really asked for.
That story being of a young Han Solo and how he met Chewbacca, Lando and how he managed to obtain the fastest hunk of junk in the galaxy.Why all the hate? Why all the negativity?
Could it be we have Star Wars fatigue?
No I don't think so. I think it's down to Disney's approach.
They want the hottest directors to tell their stories but give them no free reign to do so.
Original directors Lord and Miller left the project because of this leaving Ron Howard to pick up the pieces. He's done a fine job.
Solo is entertaining, exciting and had me invested in a story I wasn't all that bothered about.
The diminishing box office returns suggest that fans aren't all that enthusiastic either and because of this young Han may only get a solo outing.
Usual hardcore fans aren't giving this movie the chance it deserves.Disney are trying to sell Star Wars to us whether we like it or not.
Next there will probably be a movie telling the life story of the Jawa who cried ""Ooooteeeneee!!!""Back on to Solo: A Star Wars Story.
Alden Ehrenreich takes up the mantle of the lovable scoundrel.
He doesn't try and do a Harrison Ford imitation. Instead he delicately introduces certain characteristics we all know and love. Certain mannerisms. 
Han Solo isn't yet fully matured so he doesn't have all the swagger, just hints and Ehrenreich nails this.
The kid did a good job despite what the haters say.
This film was most likely doomed before it had a chance.
Sadly we live in a world where the internet now makes our minds up for us.
Trust me, I fully believe this film is worth your time and money.
Ron Howard has done a admirable job in piecing this project together. Sure there are moments where the film sags and it seems to go off the boil.
Certain characters are under utilised too. Paul Bettany's character being one that springs to mind.
There's a surprise cameo at the end that had me screaming ""Why?"" Why didn't you give me more?
Like I said Disney are selling it to us whether we like it or not!
On the plus side there's other performances we have to commend.
Donald Glover as Lando who is a particular highlight as is Woody Harrelson as Han's mentor Beckett.
Solo looks fantastic as you would expect from a movie pushing a budget nearing 300 million dollars.
Here lays the problem.
Because Solo is looking to fail to make a billion dollars it will be considered a flop. Absolute nonsense.
It's because the studio overspent.
That's 100 million dollars more than was spent on Rogue One.
Did we get a 100 million dollars worth more of a movie?
Definitely not!
By IMDB's information The Force Awakens budget was 245 million dollars.
What was Disney thinking of giving this offshoot project a much bigger budget than a movie from the new trilogy?Solo is a good movie, but a movie looked destined to fail by only Disney's standards certainly not mine.
I would happily give Solo 7.5/10 but that's not possible so in the words of Han I'll round down. What next, Bantha: A Star Wars Story?

177,p-jonsson,Quite enjoyable actually.,7,3 November 2018,"I have to admit that I was a bit hesitant about watching this movie since it seems to have received quite a bit of flak. But then so did The Last Jedi and I liked that one a lot so a few days ago me and the kids sat down to watch Solo on my home cinema rig.What I found was a quite enjoyable action adventure movie. Yes, the story is simple and quite predictable but that is fine by me. What I wanted was a simple and straightforward action roller coaster and that was pretty much what I got. I did not want some deep crap with a lot of social pointers all over the place. It is Star Wars, it is meant to just entertain. Action and special effects ""über alles"" plain and simple.Portraying Han Solo when he was young is of course a quite tall order for any actor. Everyone is going to compare him with Harrison Ford and that is pretty much a recipe for failure. Personally I am happy that they picked an actor that was not especially well known from other movies, at least not to me. If they had not done that I would have compared him not only to Harrison Ford but also to whatever character he had played before. I think Alden Ehrenreich did a fairly good job of portraying a young Han Solo.Actually, I think most of the actors was fairly okay. It's not a Shakespeare play after all. It did sadden me that Woody turned out to be such an asshole in the end though. For most of the movie I quite liked the guy.The story was, as I already wrote, simple and straightforward. Predictable as hell of course but then, in these kind of movies the story is more or less only a means to tie together the action. It worked for me. I am so glad that they actually did tie up a certain loose end at the end of the movie though. If Solo hadn't been in that last game of cards with Lando and the outcome not been what it was I would have been seriously miffed about the entire movie. Probably one of the scenes I liked the most actually.As I am writing this the movie has a rating of 7 out of 10 on IMDb and I think that is pretty much spot on. I have to say that I am quite sad about Disney's knee-jerk reaction to pull the brakes on the Star Wars movies. This is so typical of the Hollywood bean counters nowadays. If a movie is not making an insane amount of money the first couple of weeks it is considered a failure and the standard response is to pull the franchise. That is essentially saying that there is something wrong with the audience. We made a good movie but you did not like it so we kill the franchise way of thinking. Well, news flash dumb asses, if the movie didn't sell as well as you estimated either there is something wrong with your over-inflated estimates or with the movie you did. It's your fault, not the audience. Make a better one or fix your estimates! Okay, as a Star Wars fan I am perhaps biased but I am so tired of dumbass bean counters, not just where movie making is concerned.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

179,ericrnolan,"A review of ""Solo: A Star Wars Story"" (2018)",6,7 March 2019,"Was ""Solo: A Star Wars Story"" (2018) really quite as bad as everyone said it was?Yes, I do understand why it's so maligned by ""Star Wars"" purists. Han Solo has arguably been the entire franchise's most memorable protagonist since his debut in its very first film in 1977. (When we were kids and playing ""Star Wars"" in the street, how many of us wanted to be Luke Skywalker and how many of us wanted to be Han?)Disney missed an opportunity to serve up what fans undoubtedly wanted - an edgy origin story that took risks to portray this famously wily criminal anti-hero. What the studio gave us instead is a generally toothless, safe-for-primetime fable that even managed to become saccharine at times. (You could argue that Luke's origin story was far darker - he discovered the burned bodies of murdered aunt and uncle. Then he studied magical martial arts with the mysterious mystic samurai-hermit who once fought wars with his absent father.) ""Solo"" feels too much ... like a Disney movie.There are other problems too ... its narrative is unfocused, it's cluttered with too many characters, and, yes, it slavish attention to origin-story details is annoying. (The how-Han-Solo-got-his-surname bit, for example, is indeed a big misfire.)But ""Solo"" felt far more like an average film to me, instead of one that was truly terrible. I'd rate it a 6 out of 10 for being an acceptable, passably entertaining ""Star Wars"" entry. It's got a few things going for it.It's well cast, for one. I was actually very surprised at how well actor Alden Ehrenreich captures the character of a young Han Solo. They guy has natural charisma, and he seems to absolutely channel the character without once mimicking Harrison Ford. You could do a lot worse. Ehrenreich also has great chemistry with Chewbacca (Joonas Duotamo), and with Donald Glover, who equally shines in the role of a young Lando Clarissian. If you put the three of them in a sequel with a leaner, darker screenplay aimed firmly at adults, it could be a truly great movie. (Consider how lame the first ""Captain America"" movie was in 2011, and how its far darker 2014 sequel was so unexpectedly great.)""Solo"" also has great visual effects. (All the newer ""Star Wars"" movies have come a long way from the clumsy, heavy handed CGI of the prequels.) The Kessel Run sequences were especially good, and I'm still enough of a kid at heart to love those kind of dazzling set-pieces, even when they punctuate a lackluster script.""Solo"" was the sixth most expensive film ever made, at $392 million, and it was a complete commercial failure. So I doubt we'll ever see these versions of the characters again in theaters. But what about television? What about streaming services? I, for one, would keep an open mind about whether Disney could do better with this film's ingredients.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
180,Mike_Devine,"A fun, wild ride of an origin story",7,2 June 2018,"As Disney continues to expand the 'Star Wars' universe through the sequel trilogy and beyond, we're seeing just what the appetite is for spin-offs and other forays into the galaxy far far away. In 'Solo: A Star Wars Story,' we see the less than humble beginnings of the franchise's original bad boy.While this is a Harrison Ford-less portrayal of the space pirate, it's important not to overlook Alden Ehrenreich's performance here. The relative newcomer does Han justice, as he carries the same confidence (or actually, cockiness) and coolness that the character requires. From the endless one-liners to the battle scars he earns early on that make him the first-rate smuggler he becomes, Ehrenreich brings out the best in Solo.But it's not all about the title guy. Emilia Clarke steals nearly every scene she's in as Solo's childhood friend and love interest Qi'ra, as she is equal parts badass as she is beauty, and Woody Harrelson's smarmy Beckett makes for the best mentor an apprentice could ask for, if the goal is to out-swindle almost everyone you cross paths with. Then there's the Childish Gambino himself - Donald Glover - who is perfectly cast as Solo's frenemy Lando Calrissian. It wouldn't be a surprise to see a film dedicated to Calrissian's origin story at some point, although 'Solo's box office performance is probably enough to give Disney executives pause for something like this.Many complain that 'Solo' does not feel like a traditional 'Star Wars' entry. To the contrary, this film alongside 'Rogue One' actually probably have stronger ties to the story than the newest trilogy. There are enough easter eggs scattered throughout here to excite any fan of the series, and it leaves enough doors open for other journeys that could get screen time. It's action-packed and doesn't feel wooden or manufactured, and the music of John Williams echoes throughout. It's also not easy to tell that Ron Howard had to come in and rescue the production at the 11th hour - a sign of a good, proven director and a team that was dedicated to delivering a product that casual moviegoers and super fans alike could be satisfied with.'Solo' may not be the best thing to ever come out of Lucasfilm, but it lives up to the hype despite the negative media coverage of its less-than-stellar box office performance.

I was wrong, actually I thought it was better than The Last Jedi.Solo starts out during a time of galactic civil war and unrest. On Corellia, it is basically a s**thole world. It is ruled by a ruthless leader who looks like a centipede; and youths are must steal in order to survive. Han( Alden Ehrenrich) just wants a better life for himself and his long time friend/girlfriend, Q'ira ( Emilia Clarke). He tells her he is going to become a pilot and bring her along. Their plan is to escape through an Imperial Checkpoint. At this time they are being tracked, and the sooner they get to the checkpoint the better. When they arrive at the checkpoint to leave, he is able to get through; but Q'ira is trapped and detained. He tells her he will come back for her ASAP. In order to do that, he has to learn how to fly. He notices a recruitment ad for the Imperial Navy, and decides to join up. As soon as he enlists, he only gets to see a lot of ground action; but no flying. Frustrated, Han teams up with three freedom fighters. These three infiltrate the Imperial Navy, Beckett ( Woody Harrelson), Val ( Thandie Newton), and their alien friend. They want to know more about the hyper fuel they are to boost. Han is now a deserter, and caught. Once caught, his punishment is swift. He is to be fed to ""The Beast"". That beast is none other than Chewbacca ( Joonas Suotamo). Once in the pit Han and Chewy quicky become friends and escape.
Han and Chewy join Beckett's crew; they know the two will be a valuable asset to complete their mission. They are doing a dangerous job for Dryden Voss ( Paul Bettany). Voss is ruthless and gets what he wants no matter, even if it includes sacrificing the ones he's hired for the job. Beckett's job is to steal hyper fuel and deliver it to Voss. This fuel is very unstable and they need a reliable ship to carry it. Once they arrive where the fuel is located they scout the mountain. The train carrying it is right on time, but dangers lurk. Everything has to go as planned to pull off the mission. At first it seems to be going fine until Han screws up. He disobeys Beckett's orders and Val, and() are killed. Sorry but I forget their buddy. Beckett has to report back to Voss, and tell him about his failure. Once there Beckett gives Han a good tip, No Of Those People On Voss's Ship Are Not His Friends, So Lay Low. So it's time for Beckett to stall Voss. As soon as he leaves Han meets his close friend, Q'ira. This upsets Beckett, and gives him a reminder about what he said. Han is so happy to see Q'ira, but he senses that she has changed in a way.Beckett has a plan to see an old friend a friend one with one fast ship, Lando Calrissian (Donald Glover). Who is a smooth talker, gambler, and flashy dresser. Lando his droid L3-37 voiced by (Phoebe Waller-Bridge) introduce Han, and Q'ira to the Millennium Falcon. In this film it is brand new, we see more of the interior; and Calrissian's wardrobe. This ship will help them smuggle the hyper fuel and they will not have to worry about instability. First they must go to the planet Kessel, once there Han and Chewy pretend they are prisoners. Q'ira is the leader, and she is perfect in the role. Once there Han and Chewy plan their escape, L3-37 ads humor, and releases her droid friend to create more havoc. Then a battle begins, before the Beckett and company leaves. once they escape from Kessel, they have to make their way out of the deadly trenches of Kessel. this is where we get to see the Falcon make the Kessel Run in 12 par-secs. Upon their return from Kessel, surprises, and several twists at the end make this a winner.
Yes, there is CGI in this film, but it is done well. The cast is perfect and Alden did a great job portraying a young Han Solo. The effects were cool, especially through Kessel; and Glover as Lando was spot on. The only flaw I could see with the movie is at the end. This is when Q'ira contacts Maul ( Ray Parks) on her progress. The Timeline doesn't work with this movie, Han isn't older than Vader. This movie takes place about what 14 years after The Phantom Menace. Maul was killed by Obi-Wan in The Battle of Naboo. Han is in his what 20's in this movie, a New Hope Takes place 18 years after Revenge of The Jedi. This movie is in between. In A New Hope Han is 35 yrs. old, so that I caught right away- and did a WTF. I am shocked by the negative reviews. I don't know if some are comparing this movie to the original trilogy or what. As for some on here comparing this movie to feminist propaganda, WHATEVER. If you can't handle strong women in the Star Wars universe, or in reality that's your problem.
I have always been a BIG TIME STAR WARS FAN since I was six. The only time I was disappointed in the films was when the pre-quels came out. The first one was good, but as for 2 and 3 still too much CGI and bad acting. I have to say watching this movie on Friday made my day. I can't wait until the DVD comes out. To all fellow Star Wars fans enjoy this gem; because Star Wars 9 will be ready to shine those silver screens in 2019.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
185,Dark_Lord_Mark,Best Disney Star Wars...Still Garbage..The Beta Male-ing of Han Solo,5,11 September 2018,"Garbage by Disney is still garbage...just less garbage but garbage none the less.Star Wars is done. Identity politics, feminism, Liberalism destroyed it.Rule of Thumb: If men like something, it is wrong.The MSM and feminist hate males, hate male heroes, and will destroy it.This movie features way too much estrogen. From the disappointing reveal, to the disappointing twist. The basically beta maled Han.The film had ZERO chemistry except maybe Alden and Woody. Also, sure Alden, played Han very well and had a decent go with Chewy, but still not enough there to say, hey they are good buddies.The movie had a feminist robot and Lando's reaction was hilarious, but it was played straight. Unintentional comedy....6 out of 10. Better than the Feminist Awaken, Last Feminist, Rogue One....but at this point is that really saying much?",Solo - A Star Wars Story
186,Med-Jasta,Can we just stop counting this as Star Wars?,1,18 November 2019,Disney obviously just sees this franchise as a cash grab. They don't care about art. They don't care about story. They don't care about originality. They don't care about George Lucas.Just because they own the rights doesn't mean that they can contribute to Star Wars. They own it in name only. You can like this as EU but it is not Star Wars.Stop Disney from raping Star Wars and stop giving them the money to keep doing it.,Solo - A Star Wars Story
187,asb_deutsch,Much entertaining than Rogue One!,7,25 October 2018,"Ron Howard teams up with Paul Betanny. Both of them did a fine job. I like the team up between Hans and Chewbacca.
I wished that could give some more time after The last Jedi as I was fed up with too many SW scripts.
I watched this because of Emily Clark's birthday (Happy belated b'day!!). She looks so beautiful in every frame. She was looking like a true ""Khaleesi"" in this movie!",Solo - A Star Wars Story
188,Puroo,I didn't even know I was supposed to hate it,9,3 September 2021,"Initially I had never decided to watch the Star Wars Anthology movies, since I only wanted enough information to understand what the franchise is all about. I watched the movies (IX hadn't come out yet), and I really liked the storyline. So that is why I decided to watch this movie because I had really grown into liking Han Solo, and I didn't like how he was given such an unfair death. And so I decided to give this and Rogue One a watch. Unlike conventional audience, however, I liked Solo and didn't like Rogue One (the review is on my profile, in case you want to know why).Solo is the only Star Wars movie that I was able to understand in my first viewing. English is not my first language and I watch the movies without the subtitles to hone better command over the language. This is why its campiness didn't bother me, but rather made me like it even more. Although the actor didn't really look like Harrison Ford, I was happy to just see him do something on the screen. That coupled with the amazing CGI and cinematography made this movie worth a watch.I really liked the story. The beginning part where Han is trying to get himself a better life really made me feel uncomfortable in a good way. Seeing the scene I could feel how miserable Han was feeling at the moment. He only wanted a better life for his woman, and ended up being taken away from her and getting drafted. His meeting with Chewbacca felt very tense even though we all know they are going to be friends. The train robbery scene was also very cool, although I don't remember too much about this movie. It has been very long since I watched it.As long as Solo helped in adding more to my favourite human character's lore in the franchise, I'm all good with it. It's great to see a movie which is all about Han Solo and Chewbacca, completely free from the influence of Luke or Leia. I really hope Star Wars makes a third movie in the anthology so that we can have a complete fourth trilogy.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
189,shawneofthedead,"A competent and watchable Solo adventure, but this incarnation of Han is unlikely to run away with your heart.",6,23 May 2018,"Han Solo, as played by the incomparably charming Harrison Ford, is one of the most iconic action heroes in all of cinematic history. There's no denying that: it's simply a fact of life, an immutable truth. You have to give LucasFilm and Disney some credit for having the balls to re-imagine so beloved a hero - re-casting him, giving him a love interest other than Leia, filling in gaps in his backstory - all at the risk of alienating a devoted fanbase that has loved one incarnation of Han Solo for decades. It's a gamble that doesn't quite pay off, unfortunately. This origin story is fairly entertaining as outer-space adventures go, but it lingers almost permanently in the key of too safe and too slow.We first meet Han (Alden Ehrenreich) on his grim home planet of Corellia. An orphan and a petty thief, he's been living the proverbial hard-knock life on the streets with his partner-in-crime, Qi'ra (Emilia Clarke). When the pair make an ill-fated attempt to escape, only Han manages to get away. He spends the next few years honing his craft as a pilot, while doing his best to get back to her side. Along the way, Han meets several individuals who will prove instrumental in shaping him into the charming rogue we already know and love: future first mate Chewbacca (Joonas Suotamo), pragmatic outlaw Tobias Beckett (Woody Harrelson) and suave smuggler Lando Calrissian (Donald Glover). For both Star Wars novices and aficionados, there's enough in Solo to enjoy. The stand-alone nature of this film makes it a decent jumping-on point for the uninitiated. There isn't a ton of dense Star Wars lore that you need to know in order for key dramatic moments in the film to work. At the same time, life-long fans will finally get to see just how Han pulled off his legendary Kessel Run in 12 parsecs, even as the deepening bromance between Han and Chewie proves to be one of the film's purest delights. Solo also boasts another scene-stealing droid (Phoebe Waller-Bridges' spunky L3-37) and a few spectacular action sequences (particularly a mid-air train heist that defies both gravity and expectations).The trouble is that the film, as a whole, lacks the energy and inventiveness that ran through practically every frame of The Force Awakens and The Last Jedi. The heist at the heart of Solo is never quite as exhilarating as it seems to think it is. We should be swept along in the sheer epic adventure of it all. Instead, the interstellar journey feels like it's checking off boxes (befriend Chewie, snag Millennium Falcon, survive Kessel Run) rather than letting loose and having fun. As a result, the film's middle section sags and practically plods along. At least 20 minutes could have been sliced out of Solo without detriment to the story or its pace.It's no secret, of course, that Ron Howard came to the rescue after Phil Lord and Christopher Miller, the film's original directors, were fired after almost five months of principal photography. That may be another reason for Solo's comparative lack of spark. The unifying vision here isn't the screwball anarchy of Lord and Miller's The Lego Movie and 21 Jump Street - more's the pity. This is by-the-numbers filmmaking, competently executed because Howard is one of Hollywood's most reliable journeyman directors. It works, sure, but very little of it actually inspires or intrigues, apart from a doozy of a final-act character revelation that arrives almost too late to make its mark. The same could be said of its main cast. Ehrenreich is serviceable as Han Solo, largely because he doesn't try to slavishly imitate or channel his predecessor. (That's a wise choice, by the way - only Harrison Ford can do Harrison Ford.) But he doesn't pop off the screen the way he does in arthouse films like Hail, Caesar! It's almost as if he got the same studio note that was handed to Howard when he joined the production: play it safe, or else. Clarke is just barely okay as Qi'ra - she goes through the motions just fine, but doesn't really manage to colour in the depth and darkness of her character beyond what is already there in the script. At least there's fun to be had where Solo's supporting cast is concerned. Glover and Harrelson both have charisma to spare, and you might be forgiven for wanting to watch films centred on their characters instead. Paul Bettany - a last-minute addition to the cast when reshoots prevented Michael K. Williams from returning - gives excellent villain as Dryden Vos, a snarlingly avaricious crime lord with a mysterious connection to Qi'ra. As Tobias' wife, Val, Thandie Newton is fantastic, but tragically underused. It's odd to come to Solo: A Star Wars Story after the overwhelming success of the latest entries in the Star Wars cinematic franchise. All of these films have their detractors, of course, but The Force Awakens, The Last Jedi and Rogue One each demonstrated narrative courage: a willingness to commit to the fresh and unexpected, in order to tell an old story in a new way. Solo marches off resolutely in the opposite direction. This is a product hobbled by its heritage: cobbled together on the basis of and in tribute to past successes, with precious little insight of its own to offer.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
190,DeBBss,When are We Going to Get a Good Star Wars Movie?,5,10 April 2019,"Disney has been pumping out Star Wars movies every year now, and it's starting to get repetitive. It's so obvious that the Star Wars franchise has become a cash grab. I feel like the prequels are unnecessary and do a horrible job at explaining fan favorite characters. Solo: A Star Wars Story feels empty, they could have done so much better with expanding on the character of Han Solo.This whole movie is about how Han Solo became a scoundrel/smuggler and how he got the millennium falcon, but not on Han Solo himself. There's so little known about Han Solo, and I want to know more about him, but this movie does such a poor job at explaining Han Solo's origins; in fact, there is no origin plot at all. The movie just starts off with a fully grown Han Solo on a dirty crime filled planet. Nothing is explained how he got there. There was only one line in the entire movie that talks about his parents; all Han says is ""My dad was a pilot"" and that's all; could we at least get a flashback? Nothing is explained on how he got on that specific planet; was he born there? There's so many unanswered questions that could all be explained through one flashback. The plot of the story isn't bad at all, in fact, I enjoyed. I liked how Han met Chewbacca, and I liked how the heists that were preformed. The heists were action packed, and it builds up the connection between Han and Chewbacca. If there was an equal balance between explaining Han's true past, and how he got the millennium falcon and became a smuggler, I wouldn't complain so much.Alden Ehrenreich did a poor job at playing Han Solo. I feel like he tried to do an impression of Han Solo, but he didn't become Han Solo. He tried to have that charm that Harrsion Ford had, but he came out annoying and arrogant. This isn't Han Solo, it's a poor impression of him. The love interest between Han and Qi'ra was incredibly weak. We only see them once for about ten minutes in the beginning, then again halfway through the film. Qi'ra said that Han grew up with her, but we didn't see them grow up at all. I always complain about how love interests feel forced, but this is the first time where it wasn't forced at all. Lando was done the best in my opinion, and really, he's the one that's holding the film up. One huge plot hole is about how Qi'ra escaped the planet where she was left off on. They keep on mentioning how Qi'ra did horrible things, but it's never explained and it bothers me, because they keep on hyping it up for nothing.The best part about Solo: A Star Wars Story is the action scenes and cinematography. Solo: A Star Wars Story is wildly entertaining and there are scenes that just look so amazing. The production design was done perfectly, and it really captures the looks of Star Wars. The creature design was also great, which isn't much of a surprise, as it is a Star Wars movie. The entire atmosphere is drenching with Star Wars, and I could never get enough of it.It's upsetting that the only great part about Solo: A Star Wars movie is that it looks like Star Wars. Solo: A Star Wars Story is incredibly hollow; there's no proper character development, and there's so much plot holes with the story and the characters. I don't want Disney to run this beloved franchise into ground just because it's good at making a quick buck. I'm honestly right about to give up on Star Wars if it keeps this up. So Disney, please stop pumping out this hot garbage, and listen to the fans.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

193,gavinp9,An above-average addition to Star Wars cannon.,7,26 May 2018,"'Solo' is the second 'Star Wars' spin-off film - after 'Rogue One' - and like that film, does a good job of filling in backstory and providing an entertaining film, without become essential 'Star Wars' viewing. 'Solo' is set about halfway between 'Revenge of the Sith' and 'A New Hope', meaning we get Han (Ehrenreich) in his mid-20s. I think Ehrenreich does a good job of some of Harrison Ford's mannerisms and is a passable younger version. The film starts excellently, with a great car chase - well, land-speeders to be exact - on Han's home-world of Corellia.We meet Qi'ra (""Kira"", Clarke - always good to see Daenerys) and establish how Han winds up in the Empire, trying to get back to her. There's lots of great connections/throw-backs - we see how Han meets and frees Chewbacca from slavery; how they become smugglers, with mentoring from Beckett (Harrelson); how they meet Lando (Glover) & the Millennium Falcon; and how they ""made the Kessel run in 12 parsecs"". The support cast are good, but Val (Newton), Dryden Voss (Bettany), L3 (Waller-Bridge) & Rio (Favreau) don't really get that much screen time - and I would've liked to have seen a bit more of Chewie's backstory too.The film does a good job of setting the stakes in their need to rob some hyperspace fuel and how they go about it. It doesn't always feel 'Star Wars'-y, since there's no Jedi or big space battles, but when you start to forget, the aliens & John Williams' typically great score bring you back in and remind you. I'm sure some people won't like it, and it does lack a little bit of heart, but there's plenty to like throughout.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

First Film of Choice at The Plaza Dorchester Tonight - Solo: A Star Wars Story. I have read numerous headlines that say this is the first Star Wars film flop. That's a shame, and I'll tell you why. I think this is a good prequel and back story to explain many things like where Han Solo came from, how he got his name, how he met Chewbacca and how he set out on the life that he led. It's not an outstanding film, that much is true, but it provides a good solid piece of the Star Wars jigsaw. We were given lots of references all through the film which introduced us to characters, cities, spaceships and planets of the Star Wars genre. One character we met was a young Lando Calrissian, played by Donald Glover. That was a good casting call, he captured his character perfectly. I was a little concerned that the casting of of our main character would be a young Harrison Ford rather than a young Han Solo, but thankfully we were we were introduced to Han, with all the mannerisms, nuances and attitudes all things that prove, once a scoundrel always a scoundrel. The effects were good, and the plot was written well enough to fit round the story it was trying to tell. You have to remember you are watching a prequel, the characters will not be as you know them, they are young, they have yet to grow up and develop into the people we already know and love. Worth a second watch I believe.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
196,kermitkid,Solo shot first!,9,31 March 2020,"Surprisingly, one of the best parts of the movie is....Alden Ehrenreich. I know! All these years of people complaining that he was ""going to ruin the character"" and he actually did a great job. It took me about 45 minutes to get used to him, but once I did, I finally accepted that he was a young Han.
This was a lot better than I was expecting. After hearing mixed reactions and reviews, I thought it was going to be just okay, but it was fantastic! I don't know why some people have said that the first half is boring. I thought it was just the right amount of action, and slowed down when it needed to. I'd even go so far as to say it was a nearly perfect movie. Nearly. The only thing I didn't like about the movie was the character of a droid named L3. She was annoying and unneeded. It's like taking out the comedy of K2-SO and dialing up the annoyingness of C3PO and maybe even Jar Jar Binks. The movie would have more or less played out the same without her. What Harrison Ford has said about Alden Ehrenreich is true. He is ""a brilliant young actor"" and I do see him getting more roles in the future. Donald Glover was the perfect choice for a young Lando. He even does a spot-on Billy Dee Williams impression. Pretty much everyone in the cast did a great job. This movie was unexpectedly fun. Ignore the haters. Go see it.

197,rollernerd,Millennium Falcon made the Kessel Run in 12 parsecs - did you know that?,6,4 May 2021,"Welcome to another edition of Adam's Reviews!! **queue in intro music**Want to know whether the Millennium Falcon made the Kessel Run in 12 parsecs? Well jump on board for tonight's movie review, Solo: A Star Wars Story (2018) which is kinda an origin story in some sorts for Han Solo. Kicking off, Han played by Alden Ehrenreich, is a young orphan mixing up with some underground thugs on the mining planet Corellia where he is stealing goods in the black market for crime boss Lady Proxima.Just like past Star Wars movies, the main protagonist has dreams to become someone significant and plans an escape with his love interest Qi-ra played by Emilia Clarke. Their escape is almost perfect until the plan foils in the last minute with Han promising to return to make amends. He soon signs up for the Imperial air force but ends up serving in the infantry which he finds as a pointless campaign. During his three years fighting for the Empire, he finds himself once again imprisoned but with the help of a familiar Wookie he plans his escape. Of course, I am referring to Han's first encounter with his future partner in crime, Chewbacca. Both join a smuggling crew led by Tobias a thief who is really quick with the gun. Han's first exploits is the train heist, his first real smuggling business encounter, which goes sour and leads him in debt with Paul Bettany's Dryden Vos, a kingpin of Crimson Dawn. Due to a new heist approved by Vos, Han needs a fast ship...of course I am talking about the Falcon and a young rogue by the name of Lando played by Donald Glover. Also, we get to see Han's dice for you young padawans.There are a lot of characters to meet and greet and a lot to take in from beginning to end and whole new world introduced. The director and writers do well to deliver fan service of familiar scenes such as Wookie's hating to lose at three-dimensional chess yet we are introduced to how strong they are, strong enough to rip people's arms from their sockets. We also get to see what some of our favourites were like when they were younger including Lando Calrissian and found out the main frame interface of the Falcon.The movie was off to a slow and clunky start until Chewie was brought into the flick and then a great train heist story then went back to slow and clunky until Lando showed up and infused the story with some much-needed charisma and energy. Ehrenreich seemed to feed off his presence which can be seen in the Sabacc card game. The fuel train heist along-side the mountains, slithering around the peaks was a great scene, probably the best side of where we see Han as the young dreamer transitioning to the daring pilot, we are accustomed to. A lot of sacrifices were made in this heist which led to looking for a new ship however it felt a waste of characters we just got used to and gotten to know.Alden's portrayal of Han is likable and does well as the smuggler but he is no Harrison Ford which only means he doesn't seem to own the role as his own original Han Solo. Still, he did an alright job. The humour was entertaining and it was fun seeing Han trying to talk himself out of dire situations by making ludicrous claims or excuses. What stood out was Donald Glover as Lando Calrissian who gives an original performance and make the character better than pretty good. He owns each scene in which he appears. Phoebe Waller-Bridge as the voice of Lando's copilot, L3-37 felt a little too annoying as the very opinionated droid who believes in droid rights and droid independence which can be seen when L3 helps other droids abolish machine slavery. As usual Chewbacca was on point and the new guy playing him, did well with the character and the relationship with Han.Clarke's character Qi-ra was an opportunity lost, where we are believed a she has many layers, but none of them quite seem connected to each other while someone with a dark and muddy past, comes across as too nice to do some of the things she ends up doing. Not too sure if it's her fault or the script's fault or the filmmaker's fault on no developing too much about her character so you do not understand her goals or motivations. Harrelson, who plays as the mentor for Han and plays a major twist towards the end, gives a flat and safe performance. His line on not trusting anyone and predictability is the clear story arc in this film. The twist at the end was easy to spot and could've been played out differently and was a waste to the character.What really let the film down was originality - the film was too safe where some of the actors and mostly the filmmakers played it safe without embracing originality. The film was predictable and did not challenge the audience on going further with the different mythos. They had one job which was to basically serve the Han Solo movie with a generic story. The Tobias character and his crew could have been more interesting if used properly. Even Enfys Nest was a great character who was used well towards the end but again a missed opportunity. What makes a staple character? By ensuring the characters introduced in a film are given development and acted out to bring originality.The filmmakers do not understand how Han Solo and Chewbacca were not always original and daring characters in the beginning. It took time and generations of fans to recognise these characters in the franchise as staple icons on a global scale. It is evident that there are no plans to expand into more movies involving the underworld side of Star Wars which would have been nice to looked into, widening the story and hopefully widening the characters found in this film. So, we are introduced to this seedy underbelly of the criminal world however we are limited to this world with no added depth of the smuggler we all know and love. The narrative choices felt as if the filmmakers wanted to finish the flick as soon as possible and with as little interesting exchanges as it can. We miss out on any sort of dynamic back and forth between Han, Lando, or Chewie. The movie was more of a structured plot, playing out on ""Han's Biggest Milestone Hits.""Yesss the Darth Maul reveal towards the end was good but this was supposed to be a Han Solo movie wasn't it??? Overall disappointing movie with no real value - 6.8/10.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
198,Mcduff3601,Mediocre at best,6,22 October 2018,"I am torn here, for the longest time I pined for more Star Wars anything, movies shows whatever. I guess I should have wished for more specific things like, GOOD Star Wars movies and shows.I struggled to get through this one and I am a really big fan of SW. At first I didn't like the actor they picked for Han, he just felt off. Maybe it's the way he talks to exagerates his speech but I found him to be the least likeable character on screen. The movie seemed so drawn out in the beginning I watched it in three seperate sittings, which probably didn't help the momentum of the whole thing but that is how much I struggled with this one.Visually it is a great movie, none of the CGI work looks terrible. I REALLY loved all the nods to the earlier movies that came up. I couldn't believe how close to the old Lando Glover was able to sound. It was awesome seeing the origin story for Chewie and Han. It was pretty cool seeing an old character return who I thought would be gone forever. These things all saved the movie for me.As a fan I will rewatch this movie eventually, I hope they come out with a shorter version, wrap it all up in 60 mins or so and I could tolerate this one a lot more. Out of all of them I think it goes, 4,5,6,Rogue,7,Solo,3,8,1,2 is my order going from my fav to least fav of the movies.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

We meet Han's love interest from his early years and a young Lando played by Donald Glover. The film takes place in the gap between Episodes 3 and 4 when the empire have taken control of the galaxy and makes me want to see more of these spin off films but unlikely due to Disney plus and the complaints of having too much content.,Solo - A Star Wars Story
200,srdjan_veljkovic,Its best features are also its worst,5,25 May 2018,"First part of the movie seems like a generic ""heist in space movie"". It's OK, but, nothing special.In the second part, we move a little to the nostalgia zone and do have a (very) little fun. The sad thing is that the best parts of the movie are nostalgic, like when Han first sits at the helm of Millenium Falcon and then when Chui sits beside him.The main interesting thing about this movie - it's the first Star Wars movie with a single protagonist - is also it's main problem, because of the actor playing him. Alden Ehrenreich is just very different from Harrison Ford. He does his ""Ford impression"" decently enough, but, there's no way one would believe that he will grow up to be the Han Solo we know. But, even with a better choice of actor, there is something lacking in the story. It seems that I'm not alone on that one, because the end gives us the worst piece of nostalgia - the Darth Maul cameo (one of the best features of the movie becoming worst). Sure, we know from the cartoons that Darth Maul survived being sliced in half by Obi Wan Kenobi. But, that's such a silly thing. Something that's such an obvious commercial stunt, to cash in on the popularity of the character, was tolerable in a cartoon setting (ever saw what Tom does to Jerry and vice versa?). But, in the movies, it's just not.Also, it's obvious that this was envisioned as a trilogy (well, at least it was more than one movie), but, that also doesn't work. Even though Han Solo is popular and interesting to the Star Wars saga, there's just not that much to him, compared to the whole Galaxy, far, far away.Having said that, it's not terrible like Episodes VII and VIII and its not so derivative and uninspired as Rogue One. With a few changes, it could have been better and worth a watch (if nothing special still). As is, just skip it. There are fun and funny heist movies, in space or on Earth.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
201,williampsamuel,A Good Origin Story and Solid Heist Flick,7,21 March 2019,"You've no doubt heard the stories of Solo's tortured path to the screen. The rewrites, the firing of the original directors, how Ron Howard was brought on board halfway through the project to get things back on track. But fear not; while Solo may not live up to the glories of past Star Wars instalments, it's still a good summer blockbuster.I'll be honest. There really was no way that anyone could truly fill Harrison Ford's shoes in this role, any more than they'll be able to for Indiana Jones. That said, Alden Ehrenreich comes pretty close. He doesn't have Ford's voice, nor does he quite get his mannerisms down, but even as a younger, greener Solo he's certainly got the cockiness and outrageous bravado. And when he bluffs his way out of a jam, it's classic Solo.Now casting Donald Glover as Lando Calrissian is one of the best decisions Hollywood has ever made. No one else could so perfectly capture the charm, vanity, and overwhelming arrogance Billy Dee Williams originally brought to the role. He's just so shamelessly flamboyant that you want to slap him almost as much as you admire him. However, making his droid co-pilot a feminist sounding droids rights activist was not such a good decision. She's frankly more annoying than amusing, but at least the other characters seem to agree on that point.Emelia Clarke makes a very strong impression as Han's love interest. Beautiful, charming, and extremely resourceful, she's a perfect match for the smooth talking would be criminal. Just don't expect a happy ending for them. I also liked Woody Harrelson as Han's jaded, slightly eccentric mentor Beckett. He kind of reminds me of Malcom Reynolds from Firefly, but with looser morals.
Solo is at its very best when it remembers that all of its characters are criminals and the double and triple crosses start piling up in the tradition of the best con artist movies. And of course there's plenty of good action and special effects sequences. The train heist is every bit as cool and suspenseful as it looks in the trailers, and the Kessel Run is a visual delight that answers one of the lingering questions from the 1977 original. We also finally get to see the legendary game of sabaac in which Han wins the Falcon, though it's sadly too short for viewers to pick up how the game is played.I will admit the villain is a bit underwhelming. Don't get me wrong; he's menacing enough and he's got some very impressive combat moves. But we don't see enough of him or his handywork to get a feel for just how evil he is, with the result that he comes off as a fairly one-dimensional crime boss. And somehow Solo just doesn't have the same epic feel of the main series, though perhaps that's inevitable when telling a narrower, more personal story.Even if it's not on par with Last Jedi or the original trilogy, Solo is a good origin story and a better heist movie. Fanboys and casual viewers alike should find it a worthwhile way to spend a summer afternoon.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

203,Jerghal,Probably the weakest new Star Wars movie till now,7,24 May 2018,"You would think a movie about scoundrel and adventurer Han Solo would be more exciting and riveting, certainly with the talent and money they spent on this production but unfortunately it isn't.First off, the VFX are actually quite good, but the flick suffers from the same syndrome most action movies seem to have since the first Transformers movies which is chaotic shaky-cam action where the camera is way to close to the action so you can't clearly see what's going on and quickly stop caring about who's shooting who. There was one distinct action scene (the best in the movie) that didn't suffer from this problem but most others did alas.Speaking of visuals, each scene seems to have a very monochromatic look (blue, yellow, grey, etc) which reinforced the feeling that this was a boring movie even more. And the 3D (IMAX in my case) was almost unnoticeable so don't waste any money on that.The music was also a mixed bag. On one hand you have the classic Star Wars themes, and on the action scenes you had like music from Ghost In the Shell 2 (very anime like) which didn't seem to fit the movie at all. It was different from the other new releases but not in a good way.Story wise you see all the things you heard as character backstory about Han and Lando but it feels like going through the motions, putting it on film for the cannon but do we need to see it? The pacing in this film is slow in the sense that movie feels like it drags on way too long. There are so many scenes where people are jabbering but it still doesn't feel like the story is advancing.
I also felt little connection for these characters and their well being. Some die (actually for no apparent reason - it's just lazy script writing) and you just won't care.The villain is a bit weak and there never seems to be a sense of urgency or a drive towards something. The film just floats along drifting towards the end that seems to take forever to get there.Oh yeah, everybody feared that BB2 was going to be annoying (in Force Awakens) but luckily he wasn't but the new robot here called L3 surely is.I hoped for the best for this movie and even as a die hard Star Wars fan it's difficult to recommend it. Just see it once, and move on to better cinematic works out there.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
204,Maleplatypus,For me - a relief,9,16 September 2018,"I really did not like any of the ""original"" Lucas Star Wars, being pretentious, more often than not stupid and basically a soap opera with hollow dialogs and the ideas stolen from everywhere (Valerian, John Carter etc. etc.). And then I've found this ""a Star Wars story"" movies a big relief. Finally something for an older man like me. Non-pretentious story, excellent direction and cast with fine performances, structured, fun, makes me want more - everything that Lucas' Star Wars isn't. Big budget fun. I'm not interested in family relations or political order in the galaxy. Give me a simple, yet intelligent story, not mot much light-saber/force mumbo-jumbo and I'm in peace. This movie, as well as the previous Rogue One, delivers just that. This is what Star Wars should have been (in right hands - NOT George Lucas'). Thumbs up, guys.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
205,austin0731,Unnecessary,4,9 June 2018,"Solo is the Star Wars origin story that no one really asked for that ended up being a pure cash grab attempted to capitalize on Disney's new acquisition of the Star Wars franchise. Possible due to this, the movie ended up being formulaic, corporate and at certain points down right boring. The film is a textbook display of the corporate and mechanical style of filmmaking in the house of mouse, not to say that Disney is unable to deliver films with heart and a respectable story but in this case, it was disappointing and quite frankly unnecessary. The film does have some merits to be mentioned, Donald Glover's portrayal of Lando Calrissian for one was very good. Portraying the character as the level headed gambler that he is. Another interesting addition is Lando's droid 'L-3' adding a different dynamic and characteristic to Star Wars' many droids. There was even a decent build up for the relationship between Han Solo and Emilia Clarke's character 'Kiera'. However eventually runs its course and gets thrown aside by the film. There were several awkward moments in the film especially between these two characters who never regain the chemistry beyond our initial introduction. Solo had a very slow pacing, dragging along on boring storylines and uninteresting characters, while this greatly improves in around the second act the final act brings it back down to a slow burn ending that does not meet up or exceed the standard of the second act. This all comes down to the lack of actual storyline that Solo had to tell and the forceful nature that resulted in the film that was awkward and boring, a disappointment.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
206,rlaine,Maybe most enjoyable of the new Star Wars movies,9,26 June 2018,"I can't quite understand the hatred and bad box office results this film got. I found it to be one of the better Star Wars movies. Solid and well made. Good acting, very good cinematography, sets, fx, music, everything just works. Rogue One was also a good movie and I must say I probably enjoy these side movies more than those that continue the original saga. I know a lot of people have written about this movie is just illustrating events like meeting Chewie, Kessel run, getting a hold of Millenium Falcon, all this stuff that we knew have happened, but in my opinion there's a good balance of old and new. Pretty much nothing felt forced, unlike the new trilogy where a lot of stuff felt that it was forcefully included to fit the saga and often even sparked an unintended grin.Acting was some of the best I've seen in a Star Wars movie, which isn't saying much, but everyone did a good job and I'm quite sure we need to thank Ron Howard for it. And the editor who paced the dialogs and the movie very well.The sets and locations look real, maybe not quite as gritty as Rogue One, but definitely not as plastic or artificial as some.I will definitely watch this one again.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
207,RealLiveClaude,"Okay movie, but far from the Star Wars we knew and loved...",6,9 July 2018,"Did Han Solo deserved a movie of his own ? Yes... and No !On the Yes side: Ron Howard did at least a fair job to a movie which would have been far worse. The story's ok, good CGI, Emilia Clarke looks good and glad to see Chewbacca here and the Millenium Falcon soaring in hyperspace.On the No side: we would have liked to see an old Han Solo (Harrison Ford would have been a good cameo) tell his tale with flashbacks. Alden Eidereich did his best, but when you grew up seeing Mr.Ford portray this cynical and whimsy caracter who always had a bad feeling about this life, it would have been more refreshing. At Episode IV, he quoted how he did not believe in the Force. We don't see any demonstration here. However, a disciple of the Dark Side, Darth Maul is present. Despite his connexion with Tattoine to join Jabba the Hutt, how he knew Chewbacca and Lando Calrissian, and how he got the Millenium Falcon, this is rather a ""standalone"" movie not linked with our original trilogy.And for a real Star Wars story, watch back ROGUE ONE. It has a true link !Maybe Lucasfilm and Disney should take the lessons that fans taught from the last 2 movies (The Last Jedi and Solo) to serve us a good ""Episode IX"" in 2019...",Solo - A Star Wars Story

Everyone was good in this movie. Those who panned the portrayal of Han Solo are way off the mark - it was a solid performance and an entertaining way of showing Solo as a youth.

209,asifahsankhan,Is this supposed to be a Han Solo movie?,4,6 June 2018,"While I've always liked the original ""Star Wars"" trilogy, I don't have the depth of knowledge (i.e., memorization) that some do, so there are probably references in the Han Solo prequel, ""Solo: A Star Wars Story,"" that I didn't catch. That's besides the obvious ones, which kind of poke you in the face, as when Lando Calrissian (Donald Glover) tells Han Solo (Alden Ehrenreich), ""You can't make the Kessel Run in less than 20 parsecs!"" (POKE POKE)But the only time that furnishing an origin story for a minor detail struck me as wholly ridiculous was when Han learns his new Wookiee friend's name and says something to the effect of, ""Chewbacca? You need a nickname. I'm not saying that every time!"" You know, Han, you can probably just start calling him ""Chewie."" We're not going to wonder how or why you came up with it.Anyway, this is a still mostly a successful ""Star Wars"" adventure (if the fans are still kidding) with a few great action sequences and memorable new characters, written by original franchise scribe Lawrence Kasdan and his filmmaker son Jake. The credited director is Ron Howard, though of course you know he replaced Phil Lord and Christopher Miller midway through production and reshot Darth-only-knows how much of their footage. (Lord and Miller are credited as executive producers.) There are a few moments that feel distinctly like the work of the pranksters who made ""21 Jump Street"" and ""The LEGO Movie"" more than of the journeyman who made, say, ""The Da Vinci Code,"" but it's not the fractured mess it could (and maybe should) have been.It's actually quite sleek most of the time, starting with Han as a juvenile delinquent on the shipbuilding planet Corellia, where he hot-wires hover cars while making plans to escape to a better life with his girlfriend, Qi'ra (Emilia Clarke), which is pronounced Kyra (parents and their crazy spellings, amirite?). When Han and Qi'ra are separated by circumstances, he joins the imperial air force to become ""the best pilot in the galaxy,"" gets tossed out for being unwilling to follow orders, and ends up a soldier for the not-yet-completely-evil-but-well-on-its-way Empire.Han's goal is to return to Corellia and Qi'ra; to that end, he teams up with a band of smugglers - Tobias Beckett (Woody Harrelson), his wife Val (Thandie Newton), and a congenial multi-armed alien named Rio Durant (Jon Favreau) - to steal a quantity of valuable fuel called coaxium and deliver it to Dryden Vos (Paul Bettany), one of the many crime lords who rule this lawless corner of the galaxy. This leads to a tremendous set piece involving a good old-fashioned train heist on a nifty mountain railway that's just begging to be a Disney ride.But who cares about things that aren't Chewbacca or Lando or the Millennium Falcon?? Han's first meetings with the tall hairy beast and the suave playboy and the not-yet-junky spaceship are satisfying additions to the mythology, and we even get to hear Han speak some of Chewbacca's language. (Where did he learn it? Shut up, that's where.) Glover's performance as Lando is lovably weird - part Billy Dee Williams impersonation, part Glover's own spin on the cape-wearing Lothario. Lando also has one of the ""Star Wars"" universe's best robot companions, L3 (Phoebe Waller-Bridge), a fed-up female droid with wide hips who fights for robot equality (a topic I don't think these films have ever addressed before).The film drags in the middle section (during the Kessel Run, ironically) but picks up steam in the last act, when it also starts laying groundwork for other installments, including the beginnings of the Rebellion. For unlike the other standalone prequel, ""Rogue One,"" ""Solo"" leaves enough time between itself and ""A New Hope"" to allow for sequels - meaning we might actually see some of these new characters again.It means we'd see more of Alden Ehrenreich as Mr. Solo, too, a prospect that yields only tepid enthusiasm. Ehrenreich isn't bad, just a little bland, stuck with the impossible task of playing a slightly younger version of an iconic character. You can see him matching Harrison Ford's mannerisms here and there, but unlike Glover and Lando, he never makes Han his own. It doesn't help that the Kasdans' story for Han has him reacting more than acting. He achieves his objective - reuniting with Qi'ra - fairly early; after that he's just along for the ride, not really committed to or driven by anything in particular. He needs a mission he's passionate about ... which we already know isn't going to happen until he meets Luke and Leia. Sigh. At least ""Solo"" answers two questions we've long had about the series: Have Han and Chewbacca seen each other naked, and is it possible for humans to have sex with robots? And the answer to both is yes! What a time to be alive.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

Also features a new score, and sets into motion important story events concerning the rebellion Han Solo would be a part of later.

211,FelipeCarrillo,"This Western, noir and heist sci-fi motion picture directed by three hardly harmonizable filmmakers seems to have what is necessary, but not enough",6,1 August 2018,"Since its earliest signs of life, there has been a lot of speculation about the ""cursed"" production the newest Alden Ehrenreich-starring Star Wars bet has had to hold up, despite it clearly hurted the final footage by the shocking and sudden director change, the non-confirmed rumors about the young main star's acting doubts, some light and notable screenplay troubles and the proximity in the release dates with both the controversial film by Rian Johnson and Marvel Studios' couple of box office hits; Whoever would have wanted to take responsibility for the difficult work wrapping up production and trying to settle things as best as possible with ""The Lego Movie"" directors Phil Lord' and Christopher Miller's shooted material, would has to stand up to a huge pressure, possibly one of the biggest that has raised in the last five years with respect to a rugged mega-budget movie. Ron Howard put on big boy pants and held his hand up, he agreed to pick up the reins on this, giving the best of himself to join together the most improvisational, happy-go-lucky style of the previous directors with his more low-key dramatic, independent inclinations; no doubt, he made a worth-watching film, but there are enough obstacles in the way to say that this should not be the official movie about Harrison Ford's classic character's legacy.The script isn't sufficiently bold as brass and amusing coming from Han, in fact, those who steal these moments are, ultimately, Lando Calrissian, Qi'ra, and L3-37, even ever-fantastic Harrelson's Beckett and Dryden Vos by Bettany are not tokens that move interestingly through this sometimes watered-down galThe seductive, sarcastic atmosphere is gone in large part by a screenplay that's certainly oblivious to 90's nostalgia and a poorly charismatic interpretation. Star Wars films have always alternated their action, character-development, drama and comedy scenes with exquisite expertise, and although this is not the exception, many of the above-mentioned hyper-onerous sequences don't add or signify nothing substantial to the progress of the plot, they're simple and predictable entertainment that closes unexplored paths, are the usual channel to satisfy audiences who doesn't relate to this universe of creatures and battles. Besides some unmissable cameos hidden in the frames, this space-crime story fits in the canon without denial because it doesn't add anything to the franchise, works well as a standalone movie, but absolutely not as a Star Wars spin-off, something that the three directors didn't understand very well. There are several scenes that should have been cut from the footage in order to lighten the plot load and its length, but of course a Lucasfilm flick will never get a less-than-two-hour runtime. Nobody thought such an important and emblematic character for Star Wars would get this kind of treatment and result in his solo film. It's difficult and disappointing to say that this is the most unsatisfactory and uneven movie among all the new race of films coming from Disney, but there's good news, a worthy payoff is waiting for us. Undoubtedly, the first, second and part of the third act were formally flat, uninteresting, lacking the charm and dynamic wit that one would expect in a great idea like this, nevertheless, the last fifteen minutes are the wonder, is why you paid your ticket, they are, personally, what the whole movie must have been. The thrilling final minutes where all the characters are pretending, the necessary surprise factor, that deceitful and malicious air, powerful pictures, engaging performances, an overwhelming soundtrack and a true Han Solo made up a full-of-personality ending. A space ""Focus,"" the game of lies and truths put the spectator in a state of indecision and the real seductive, tricky atmosphere gives hope to your heart and makes you see things from another point of view, one that hurts less, but it stings the same.Alden Ehrenreich is not the Han Solo we expected. It's true that the actor of ""Hail, Caesar!"" doesn't have much from where he can hold on tightly to ""create"" his character, actually, instead of getting under his skin, he seems to perform a well-intentioned but failed tribute to the attractant blackmailer played by Harrison Ford, a nice representation on a mold of the character, even though it exceeds him in size. There's no intrigue, no spark and no curiosity in seeing what can happen to his character, which obviously won't suffer so much as his companions, however, one finally ends up accepting his mischievous smile and limited charisma. On the other side of the coin, Donald Glover nails it as cheat gambler Lando Calrissian, the personality and feeling that the rapper, actor, screenwriter and a long etcetera gives another of the most emblematic men of the saga are fascinating; unlike Ehrenreich, his interpretation isn't a tribute or a personal adaptation, he's the same character, we see him in his actions, the confidence of his eyes and his glamorous attitude, it's not for nothing that they're cooking up the idea of the first Star Wars film starring a black person, a truly unexpected move. Joonas Suotamo's Chewbacca doesn't get a meritorious development since, although he establishes the emergence of his unwavering friendship with Han and shows more Wookiees, his guttural actions don't end up being a source of humor or nostalgia, he's a relegated Chewie; yes, back then, he has had to endure hard slavery for a long time - considering him as a beast - but he never gets the tools to shine as others. Everything seems to point that from the entire compendium of already known characters, the most nostalgic and joyful reunion is with the Millennium Falcon, it's exciting to see the starship again since 2015 and to know only one of its anecdotes. Apart from the characters belonging to the main saga of yesteryear, Emilia Clarke, and her tender dimples are a powerful addition to the series. Qi'ra, her character, experiences a sudden transformation that moves her away from bromides and places her on the same level of acting conviction of Felicity Jones' Jyn Erso, Lauren Dern as Vice Admiral Holdo or Daisy Ridley's Rey. Her performance is brimming with strength, she's intelligent and humane, perceptive and strategic, knows what to say and when doing it with an enviable and unusual talent, is capable and grandiose. Paul Bettany and Woody Harrelson, two monumental actors, cannot exploit their skills adequately because they don't give enough depth, time on screen to the former and gives a hesitant, irregular treatment to the latter; a shame and a huge waste of talent, they clearly deliver applaudable performances but don't surpass that limit, I prefer to remember them as Marvel's Vision by Bettany and Willoughby by Harrelson for Martin McDonagh in ""Three billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri."" Special mention and congratulation to Phoebe Waller-Bridge s L3-37 and Erin Kellyman as Enfys Nest, who besides starring two of the most emotive and legendary scenes of the film, give short but energetic and interesting performances.Exclusive are those who have the power and experience to judge the cinematography of a seasoned, Oscar-nominated Bradford Young. It's true that there aren't many vivid colors in the frames and sometimes it can be cumbersome to try to understand what's happening on screen because of the palette of opaque, ochre and gray tones, but Young angles to explore new fields with new techniques in order to give a defined personality to a story that gets stuck or, rather, entangled; they say the problems with their work are attributed to a poor calibration of the projectors in the theaters, unable to show in full splendor the high-intensity, low-brightness visuals required by the film. Just like the script, the action sequences and in general the development scenes of the first, second and a large part of the third act, the pictures aren't as aggressively magnetic and engaging as those of ""The Last Jedi"" or ""Rogue One,"" however, it throws one memorable pic after another along the last fifteen minutes, specifically purposeful angles, dark but perfectly contrasted frames and camera movements able to revive hope. Again, that shows what we expected from this film. Anyway, it's worthwhile to delight our senses and try to find the purpose of the ""Arrival"" cinematographer with his most commercial release. From my point of view, thank you for a shot etched in my memory by its hurtful beauty, starring Clarke, looking through a fence of pain and illuminated in the eyes by a love that shines from afar. Such happens to the score composed and adapted by John Powell, who leaves much to be desired trying to reach the sound potential of the situations, only showing in those last moments raucously sensory compositions. This is the very first time the twice Oscar-winner editor Pietro Scalia works for Star Wars and although he understands well enough how to play and control the spectator's emotions with films as ""Alien: Covenant"" or ""The Martian"" both by Ridley Scott, the final footage, the troubled final footage lacks vividness, spark and emotion even in the seemingly more entertaining sequences. ""Solo: A Star Wars Story"" directed by Ron Howard - and we all know that Phil Lord and Christopher Miller as well - is the most labile, uneven and controversial entry within the cinematic Star Wars canon all in all. It's short of narrative stunning and direction, an interpretation worthy of the title role, visual and sonorous magnificence, a suitable and personalized tone; this movie needs all this to offer more than a mere heist story to Solo. The dreams and desires of Warsies are condensed in about fifteen minutes, which although they don't manage to be a lift in the face of more than two hours of this irregular space Western, get the hope alive as for the huge potential of the controversial spin-offs of the science fiction franchise by which current science is known.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
212,TheVictoriousV,"Unexceptional, predictable, and scruffy-looking. (Copied from myself with permission)",5,9 January 2019,"This one's worth skipping.You can't say Star Wars fanboys aren't a forgiving bunch. Here is a film that had its directors replaced at a suboptimal time because the project was turning into too much of a comedy in the hands of Christopher Miller and Phil Lord (the origin story of Han Solo is no laughing matter, you guys) and gave us no trailer or footage until just a few months prior to the premiere, which might prompt you to wonder if the film will even be complete upon release.It might indeed, but not if you're a devoted fan who just has to know the full story of things that were mentioned in throwaway lines in a 1970's space opera. Having accepted the reality of modern-day movies, I myself am far more interested in the Gonk Droid prequel and The Life and Times of Lak Sivrak.More good news: Alden Ehrenreich reportedly had to be assigned an acting coach during production, making me wonder if his part in Hail Caesar, where he played a frankly hopeless young actor, was really scripted. Still, the faith of the fanboys, nerds, and clickbait authors remained unmoved, but the reception and box office numbers of Solo: A Star Wars Story tell us everything.The movie, ultimately directed by Ron Howard, also tells us everything; every little thing that fans have pointlessly speculated over since they heard them mentioned in A New Hope - excluding those who watched it in 1977 before it was ""a thing"", I would guess. We see how young scoundrel Han Solo was taken under the wing of a space-travelling smuggler named Beckett (Woody Harrelson), how he met Lando Calrissian (Donald Glover, aka Gambino, aka ""This Song Makes Mostly Accurate Observations About Contemporary America So It's Propaganda""), his brief time serving in the armies of the Galactic Empire, how he first piloted the Millennium Falcon, and his first encounter with Chewbacca the Wookie (Joonas Suotamo), his yeti-like co-pilot.I spotted other Wookies as well - loved ones of Chewie included - so even the Star Wars Holiday Special is presumably still canon, y'all. What a time to be alive!New to the Star Wars franchise, unless there's an Expanded Universe novel that proves me wrong on this, are Emilia Clarke's Qi'Ra, Thandie Newton's Val, Phoebe Waller-Bridge's L3-37 (gotta have at least one droid; and no, I couldn't tell you whether her name is a cringey reference on purpose) and Paul Bettany's villainous Dryden Vos. Bettany's character, like so much else in this disaster of a production, was apparently intended to be quite different at some point during the making of Solo. I am not sure how much of the original character had to be digitally replaced.Solo ends on a twist that unveils the true nature of the villains and to whom they answer; a twist so random and inexplicable in its delivery of fanservice that it seems like something out of a Fan Film that I wanted to do when I was six. I have conveniently misplaced the manuscript.Without revealing too much: I sense a set-up for that Ben Kenobi spin-off we're supposedly getting in the future. Because of course we are. Some say Solo is the beginning of the Star Wars saga's transformation into a series like the Marvel Cinematic Universe, which is a reasonable concern now that Disney own both, but I think it began to show with all the Whedon-esque quipping in the script of The Last Jedi.This is a mediocre movie on its own, although its status as a Star Wars entry makes it outstandingly ugly; being too dim, full of sub-par special effects, and action scenes that often look as fake as they feel. It is a film that ought to cement the fact that rushing production and coordinating things poorly, all because you have a Cinematic Universe to fill out, is usually a recipe for crap and that Cinematic Universes don't necessarily allow for the best of products. Assuming the movie, or its behind-the-scenes stories, WILL cement any of this is unlikely.What did I enjoy? Well, there are some decent performances in spite of it all - namely Glover and Harrelson; Ehrenreich does little besides trying and failing to impersonate Harrison Ford and Emilia Clarke makes for a useless love interest. Certain exchanges and interactions are sufficiently fun, the music is wonderfully ""Star Wars"", and the fanboy within me was happy to see some of these places and beings once more, coupled with a few genuinely nifty references to older films. To be fair, though, this wears off somewhat (for some) when you get to return to your childhood once per year. More than that if you count everything else that exists now, Disney-owned or elsewise.Solo - not to be confused with Sálo - is not dismal, but it is also not impressive. It's nothing much at all. I'm even beginning to forget it was (barely) made. What was I talking about?",Solo - A Star Wars Story
213,Chalice_Of_Evil,Solo: A Scoundrel's Story...,8,24 May 2018,"Since the casting of a young Han Solo was first announced, I wondered why they went with Alden Ehrenreich, as I'd thought Anthony Ingruber (who I first saw in the movie The Age of Adaline) was like a perfectly de-aged Harrison Ford and seemed tailor-made for the role. However, I reserved passing judgement on the guy playing young Han until I at least saw a decent amount of footage with him. After having watched the trailers, I was still unsure. After seeing the movie? My verdict is...he's adequate, but I'll always wonder what this movie could've been with Ingruber in the role instead.After the familiar 'A long time ago', we're treated to a bit more text setting up where this story begins (though evidently not enough to warrant an 'opening crawl'). When we meet Han, he's stealing a speeder, accompanied by Qi'ra (Emilia Clarke), who he grew up with on the mean streets of Corellia. I enjoyed the look of this chase scene, the setting and the 'feel' of it, like a good old-fashioned car chase. We get a sense of the history between their characters just in time for them to get separated, which leads to Han enlists in the Imperial Army to elude his pursuers (which is where he acquires the last name Solo).We eventually get to the first meeting between Han and Chewbacca, which doesn't go down quite the way you'd expect. Building the relationship between Han and Chewie was always going to be one of the most important parts of the film, and both actors portray their growing friendship well. We also see more sides to Chewie, as he's eager to help out fellow Wookiees. Just as Han first stepping onto and piloting the Millennium Falcon are pivotal moments, so too is Chewie proving himself the excellent co-pilot (that we already know he is) to Han, and even Qi'ra acknowledges it's him who belongs in the co-pilot chair. On top of seeing his developing friendship/partnership with Chewie, we also get to see Han acquiring his blaster, learning why it's smart to shoot first and being optimistic with ""I've got a really good feeling about this."", which will inevitably turn into his classic and much more pessimistic line. We're also treated to some subtitles when Han communicates with Chewie in his Wookiee language.It's not long before they've gained each other's trust and helping each other out. The pair then fall in with a crew of thieves made of Woody Harrelson's Tobias Beckett (who Han learns much from, both good and bad), the seemingly perpetually moody Val (Thandie Newton), and the multi-armed Jon Favreau-voiced alien Rio. Pulling a job with them seems like the best course of action to further Han's goal of getting back to Qi'ra. Unfortunately, she's now under the thumb of Paul Bettany's villainous Dryden Vos.While the crew who Han falls in with are played well enough by the actors, it never feels like we really get to 'know' them or form an attachment to them. Though the sequence on the train was very well done, I thought. Things kick into gear when Han is first reunited with Qi'ra and she takes him to meet Lando Calrissian (Donald Glover). Both actors do a good job of quickly establishing that relationship between their characters we're so familiar with. It quickly becomes clear why they're so mistrusting of each other when we see them reunite in Episode V.Glover is much more successful in playing a believable young version of Billy Dee Williams' Lando than Ehrenreich is at playing a young version of Harrison Ford's Han. At times Glover even *sounds* like older Lando (and we finally discover why Lando always pronounces 'Han' differently to everyone else). He certainly earns that 'you old smoothie' comment from Han in Episode V, but he's also a cheat. His relationship with the droid L3-37 shows that he *is* capable of caring (though he also loves his collection of capes). Things are set up nicely by the end of the film for when Han and Lando will next meet.The relationship between Han and Qi'ra also proves quite the complicated one, as you're never quite sure of which side she's on (though she does get some awesome moments, especially towards the end, with Emilia getting to swing a sword more than she ever has in Game of Thrones). I thought she was an interesting character, and Emilia gave a very nice performance (plus, she certainly had the 'classic' look working for her, with all those fine costumes she wore/hairstyles she sported).Another thing I liked about the film is that it has a sort of Rogue One look/'vibe' to it (which I don't think is a bad thing, since I quite enjoyed that movie). Giving the standalone films a different 'feel' to them (which sets them apart from the main trilogies) is a good thing, I think. While the movie does have nods to what's yet to come (those are some well-traveled gold dice Han carries, and you'll see why he brags about the 'Kessel Run' in an excellent sequence that will have you sympathizing with the Millennium Falcon by the end), they thankfully avoid going overboard with them (and one particular cameo is sure to make fans of the prequel trilogy lose their minds...assuming they haven't already). And if you've ever wanted to see why it's not wise to upset a Wookiee...then you're in luck. While I do think some alterations could've been made (not just Ehrenreich's casting) to improve the film, I don't think it's anywhere near as 'terrible' as some have made out. It might be a film that seemingly 'nobody asked for', but it's still not Episodes I & II levels of 'bad'. It does feel like there's set-up for possible sequels to come, but I'm not sure how likely it is that they'll ever happen. If they don't then I don't mind this being a 'solo' film.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

I would like to say that this only works if the viewer casts aside all Star Wars expectations, but then that would also mean to disregard some of the best parts which were references to the rest of the Star Wars universe.

216,daniewhite-1,Sappy the adventure story,3,30 December 2019,"I don't know how Han Solo became the character introduced in 'Star Wars A New Hope'. I've seen the film story about this character now but I still don't know anything about the Han Solo from 'A New Hope'.That's the first problem here.The second is that I didn't really want to know any more about the characters origins in the first place; being introduced to him for the first time along with Luke Skywalker is pretty much the perfect arrangement as far as I'm concerned. This film does nothing to alter my opinion on that regard and only serves instead to reinforce it.I think that 'Solo' was benighted by a bad pre-production, a bad production and bad post-production. I tend to accept that this is so because it explains why the film is, simply put, so bad.Things are included that surely needed excising from the script. Lots of things. Most of the things actually.Characters. Dialogues. Expositions. Plots. Sub-plots. Set pieces. Action. Jokes. Humour.There had to be a doomed romance. Oh dear. Maybe in a film about Han Solo as a young man he might have had actual intercourse with humanoid females? No. That's not Han Solo, as we knew him, as he would imaginably be when younger..........young, thrusting, pan sexual Lando.....does he have carnal relations....with anyone/anything? No. Another doomed romance there. These lads.I can pretty much end my review of every inconceivable idiocy integral to this flop at this stage; I think that my observation/objection to this films portrayal is summed up adequately already. I mean, I've met young adults. They aren't like the young adults in this film. They get up to so much more. Which is a problem if 'Solo' meant to be about........what was that character again......oh yeah Han Solo.This was 'sappy, a sappy woes story'.For a single criticism of a plot detail I might venture that when you are travelling somewhere that nobody has ever travelled before and where there are no fixed reference points a navigator is useless. What are they navigating? They've never been there before. They have no map. They can't use dead reckoning methods. What do the makers of 'Solo' think advantages Han Solo in the Kessel run by having the navigational knowledge of any droid in these circumstances? Surely anybody could take a baring at the beginning of the journey, targeting the destination, and give info on course corrections to regain that baring. So basically, what is a navigator contributing....from past knowledge?? I waited for an answer. 'Solo' provides none. I don't think that the filmmakers knew that there was a question there. That they had set up. Strange. Why make a point about something if it remains redundant for the purposes of the story.Oh. It's the sexless romances again I guess. Caring and sharing. Exactly what young lads out and about the galaxy would be prioritising.There were a lot of scenes here that felt to me like they were there to establish missions for a computer game spin off.The plot features countless double crosses. Wild chases. Missions. Escapades. And reveals. I think it was all camouflage for the lack of ideas behind why this film exists and how it could portray Han Solo.'Solo' ends in keeping with its entire run time as our protagonist, sappy, is left like a sap, by his young love. Betrayal. Except that it's so obvious that actually she is heroically saving him by sacrificing her life to protect him by returning alone to her criminal overlords and thereby shielding our Han Sappy from greater evil.Unfortunately a film that decided to make Han Solo into Han Sappy has failed to convince me that I've seen anything useful to a fan of the original trilogy.I rate 3/10 due to overall deficiencies in almost all non technical areas of this film. However some of the locations and cgi special effects designs are good to look at. A couple of jokes or skits have a slight humour value along the way so it's not a total loss for me.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

The movie is prety good, it's fun, there are some great adventure scene, there is amazing CGI, and, that's it, overall, it's fun, you can watch and enjoy, buuut, it really didn't have to be a ""Han Solo movie"". This is probably the aspect that most hurts the movie as a whole. Like the ""name scene""... really, I mean, REALLY! DID WE NEED THAT? Gosh, this is one of the most forced moments I've ever seing in a movie before. It seems almost like they finish the movie and went ""well, ok, now we need to add Han Solo's references here, in order to make that a ""Solo movie"". WE DIDN'T NEED THAT! And this truly pisses me off.There are lots of scenes like that. Like, why does the Millenium Falcon needs to be completely different from how we know she is 3 years up to that point? Well, this is the biggest criticism I have to say about the movie, and was something we already knew, right? I was one of those that always said ""we do not need this movie to happen, it's irrelevant"", and... even though I think is a decent film, you can watch it and have fun, it is still irrelevant, think about it, we have just one opportunity a year to see a Star Wars movie (and this could even change in the future), is this a movie that worths the waiting? I don't think so, and now, we will probably never see that Obi-Wan movie, because of this flop. it's sad.But, besides that, the movie is decent (even more if you think how much did Ron Howard reshoot in a short period of time). Han and Cheewie's relationship is one of the best things here, they defintely nailed it. And, even though Han's character is a bit inconsistent (he is full of confidence in a scene, and in another can't finish a sentence), Alden was great, the kid is a great actor. Lando bothers me throught the movie though, he is just there, for almost no reason at all (he is apparently retired, and in the fist call he gets to do a crazy job, he accepts). But Donald Glover is another great actor, and we know that. I liked Harrelson character, overall. Emilia Clarke is fine too.So, that's it, overall is a fun movie, you can't enjoy it, just forget it suposed to be a Han Solo film. 7,5/10",Solo - A Star Wars Story
219,namob-43673,"Worse then TLJ? Yes, yes it is.",1,17 March 2019,"I am not one of those people that think that social commentary or politics do not belong in movies - in fact I think politics, feminism, gay characters and such can enhance and better a movie, if done correctly.
Nor am I one of those that hate The Last Jedi beyond reason. I do loath that movie because it is so inapt and because it is throws all logic out the window, but as a movie, as a cinematic experience The Last Jedi is not that bad. Sure it is one of the worst movies ever made if seen within the Star Wars universe, but it is not as bad as many claim. The visuals are great, the acting is great, the music fantastic, and if you look at TLJ outside of the original movies its not complete crap.This movie however. Oh boy.If those hating on TLJ because of its politics and how it ruins the lore have a point half the time, with this movie they are correct 9 times out of 10.Really Kennedy? Really? This is where you want to take this franchise?First of all this is very generic sci-fi, and I think 20% is stolen from Firefly, which is sacrilege in its own right. Secondly we get to know very important and super relevant fact like how Han got his blaster, oh wow, we all really wanted to know! Third; this movie is dumb. I mean really, really stupid. It is poorly written, poorly constructed, poorly acted, and the visuals are bland, the music boring, even the freaking clothes are wrong. Everything is wrong.
And fourth we get the worst character ever in Star Wars. No, lets be real; the worst character ever in the history of cinema! This character is L3-37, which is a feminist/socialist rights activist droid (yes, droid!) and has sex with pansexual Lando Calrissian... when ""she"" is not bringing stuff out of her... ""female"" area to solve problems like a walking feminist McGuffin. Worst of all they take this droid and upload it into the millennium falcon so from now on, throughout all the original movies, up until today, this character is actually the mind and brain of the millennium falcon...
I am not sure if there is better way to destroy this entire saga, but if there is I cannot think of one.If I ever make a ""worst movies of all time"" list, this movie will be on it. The only redeeming trait this movie has is that it is, at times, unintentionally funny - such as how Han got his last name, which is yet another very important super interesting fact; he got it from a guard! Yes, how great movie, how fantastic. We all really needed that information. I was laughing like a crazy person at that part, but more in a ""I cannot believe this"" kind of a way. Han Solo.... yea...So I do have to agree with all of those people claiming Star Wars is dead. I do not see it coming back from this, and if the series does make a comeback it will be the biggest miracle of all time. I am certainly not going to see the next installment, and even if that movie is beyond fantastic, and praised by all, I am not going to believe a single word and still not going to see it to find out.That is it. Star Wars gone. Good job Darth Kennedy, I assume you got well paid for ruining this universe. Once you get fired, which will happen, Disney is a company after all, you will likely get a job at some feminist think-tank or work at the UN, so no worries. Happy times.

Disney can make good flicks to fill in the gaps of an already established story, original thinking for the sequels... not so much. So we meet a somewhat younger Han on his home planet Corellia and he's making a break for it, with his bff Qi'ra, aka Daenerys of the House Targaryen, the First of Her Name, The Unburnt, Queen of the Andals, the Rhoynar and the First Men, Queen of Meereen, Khaleesi of the Great Grass Sea, Protector of the Realm, Lady Regnant of the Seven Kingdoms, Breaker of Chains and Mother of Dragons, before things get too crazy, but alas they are split and Han does the only thing he can to escape the planet, join the Empire... sees some battles, meets Woody from Cheers, gets into a gang, we finally hear Han speak Wookie, and it was just terrible...

One thing i find about Any of the new star wars movies is that i feel, and maybe its just me, i feel a lack of connection and caring about the characters that was there with the originals...maybe with some history and continuity, that will change but right off, the stories came across just as glorified space adventures that were easily forgettable, the characters names i can't even remember and as such id not care whether i watched it again or added it to my collection of movies...like i said ,I'm not a star wars fanboy but some of the originals were cool...i had same issue with the primitive tech,but the stories were cool and so were the characters. This particular movie had long portions of it devoted to fight scenes and battles with little content in between where characters could have been more developed...Overall, all said, not a bad movie, I'm being nitpicky, and most people who like scoff will like it and star wars fans will probably love it.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
224,Lewis_Heather787,It was fine ? Nothing mind blowing!,6,24 May 2018,"Even though being a huge Star Wars fan I really could not care any less for this film before I saw it. Nothing against the story or anyone involved, I just was not interested in the slightest. Therefore went in with a really open mind and see what Ron Howard had achieved in salvaging this film.Wait a minute before I get into the meat and bones of the review, erm...... I'll slightly spoil the review and saving, whoever is reading this, time by saying that I thought the film was fine. Actually maybe even deserves to be called a ""good film"" in places, however its not mind blowing or very memorable. A very safe Star Wars film, I wonder why they chose to go so safe, its not like there has ever been a divisive Star Wars film recently or ever........*cough*...... Anyway back onto the more detail part of the review.PositivesFirstly Ron Howard has done a fine job coming in and salvaging this production disaster, from the outside at least, and creating a decent film in the process. Howard's directing experience shines throughout the film, but what else do you expect. Overall he has done a fine job, no complaints.The two biggest fears going into this film were the portrayals of Han Solo and Lando Calrissian. Much beloved characters which could easily be done badly in the wrong hands, but no pressure on the actors who take on the roles because Star Wars fans never really get that upset when you try to reimagine beloved characters. However joking aside Alden Ehrenreich and Donald Glover have done a fantastic job considering the immense pressure they were under and taking on these iconic roles. Both of them are the standouts of the film and it is crucial that they work otherwise the whole film around them film crumble. The best thing about both of them is that they are not trying to do an impersonation of Harrison Ford and Billy Dee Williams respectively but are making the characters there own whilst giving us the familiar vibes we know and love.The rest of the cast is fine Woody Harrelson, Emilia Clarke and Paul Bethany were all fine in there roles, but nothing else that standouts.NegativesMainly to do with story, its just a bit boring/dull. You would imagine that the Kessel run would be this extravagant quest or journey because it is referenced so much in the previous films. However it was just fine and not that enthralling really , nothing bad just..............yeah fine.However there are a couple of choices that the character of Han Solo makes during the film that are questionable to say the least. Now anyone who had a problem with Luke Skywalker in The Last Jedi, me excluded, should definitely have problem with this as well. Han at the end of the film gives the chance of a lot of money for a little rebellion. Now don't get me wrong that sounds great in theory if only he wasn't so against that idea at the beginning of A New Hope. As he says in A New Hope ""Im only in it for the money"" once he saves Leia from the Death Star.............im pretty sure he says that?? Doesn't really add up oh well!Overall its fine nothing mind blowing or that memorable but then again nothing wrong about it either. 60% out of 100 or 6 out of 10, two great performances but the story was lacking a bit, a nice little cameo from Darth Maul, I assume thats him and not Savage Opress. For me though and I know I'm in the minority on this, its know where near as good as The Last Jedi, Rogue One or Force Awakens for that matter. Dare I say it that I would rather watch Revenge of the Sith than this......each to you own. Nothing wrong with it just not that memorable a fine addition to the Star Wars saga.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

For the most part he had the right swagger down. There were a couple moments where it didnt feel very Han to me, but I think that was more the writing than the actor. There were some good comical moments. Like a certain shower scene for example. But, I also found numerous spots where the comedy came off across a bit childish. Also, I don't know why every Star Wars film needs a sassy robot. R2, BB8, K2S0 and now L3. And trust me, I loved all those sassy robots but this was the first one who I genuinely was annoyed by. But I think the thing the kind of annoyed me the most is that this whole movie's plot basically boiled down to was showing us the legendary Kessel Run. Like, that seemed to be the whole point of the movie. And when you think about it that way, it just seems like a rather pointless movie. I mean, why did this have to be made? And I know that it seems like Im really crapping on this movie. Its definitely not awful. I think if it werent part of the Star Wars universe, it would be a fun little space romp. But as a part of the Star Wars universe, it just doesnt feel necessary. I didnt feel like it really added anything to the lore. I enjoyed the cameos, and there were certainly some great moments.

227,dormesher-21565,Solo,8,30 August 2021,Solo A Star Wars Story. A good film and fun entry into the star wars however in my personal opinion its the weakest of the series. This movie in my opinion wasn't really needed and dosent really add anything to star wars.I like Han Solo in this movie and I like seeing him meeting Chewbecca and Lando and seeing do the Kessel Run was awesome and really nostalgic for this Star Wars fan. The new characters are interesting and I like Beckett.The action is great and it's a simple great story but it's basically the same story arc the Han goes through in A New Hope he is a scoundrel and then due to the events he becomes the hero. It's just the story surrounding his arc is different this time its all for substance called Coaxim which is used for Hyberfuel but the Crimson Dawn want to use it to spread death across the Galaxy.My only issue with the movie is it really dosent add anything to the Star Wars and everything Han does in this we know becomes a smuggler gets kicked out of the Imperial Academy and does the Kessel Run it dosent add anything unlike Rogue One that added something A New Hope and answered alot of questions.I also feel like story arc Han goes on is exactly the same he has in New Hope and makes you feel like the movie wasn't really needed.That's not to say I didn't enjoy this movie I really did it's a fun simple story for a Star Wars adventure and it's got some great moments the effects are also great aswell the Darth Maul Cameo may confuse some people if they didnt know he was alive though but it does tie into Clone Wars and Rebels really well.My favourite moment in the film is definitely the Kessel Run actually seeing it was pretty cool wasn't needed but it's was awesome to watch and now at least we know what he meant now in A New Hope.Verdict 8/10 a good but the weakest Star Wars movie in my opinion it's a fun simple story but dosent really add anything to star wars apart from adventures we know Han has been on. I like the actors and the action but the movie wasn't really needed still fun though.,Solo - A Star Wars Story

And the only reason people are giving this one a pass is because it uses characters that were already established and developed in other films. If this script involved all new, and unknown characters, in a new universe, everyone would be like 'what the heck was that?'.
None of the characters are interesting. How can someone mess up Han Solo, Harrison Ford clearly acted him in such a way that it should be easy to follow, but no, they made the Han Solo character into a whiney, uncharismatic wimp. Donald Glover's Lando was pretty weak as well. After that I only remember Chewbacca. The rest of the characters, I have no idea what their names were, that's how much of an impression they made. Anyone even care when that 4 armed guy dies at the beginning? Who was he anyway? And why did we even have to care?
Worst pacing of a heist story line, no energy, super dull. And why do we see darth maul? Like another reviewer pointed out, he died when Anakin was a kid, so that means Han Solo should be as old as Alec Guiness was in Star Wars, lol.

230,Jared_Andrews,Keep your expectations low and you'll leave satisfied,7,3 June 2018,"I went in with low expectations and walked out satisfied. Solo is pretty good. Is that a high enough standard for any Star Wars movie? That's a worthwhile discussion for another time. For now, let's focus on this movie. All my concerns, all my worries about why the movie might bomb, melted away as I watched. Alden Ehrenreich is a good young Han Solo. He's not Harrison Ford, which was my concern, but no one is. It's an unreachable bar. Give the guy a fair shot to play this cool, funny, confident and somewhat naïve version of Han. He won't blow you away, but he won't greatly disappoint either.  Ehrenreich's performance is a microcosm of the entire movie-pretty good, not incredible. I'm okay with that. Donald Glover as Lando is even better than pretty good. He owns each scene in which he appears. The movie was off to a slow and clunky start until he showed up and infused the story with some much needed suave and energy. Ehrenreich seemed to feed off his presence. Glover made him better.  The plot is a bit light. That may have been intentional, so there is more to explore in future Solo and Lando movies.

It's clear they researched Harrison Ford and Billy Dee Williams' acting in the original trilogy because they nailed both Han and Lando's suave and fearless demeanors. I genuinely believed they were the characters despite being new faces. The film's only crime is that it's hackneyed and predictable, but it passes as a wildly entertaining popcorn thriller.

232,TheOny13,Solo: A somewhat entertaining film,7,9 August 2020,"This review and this movie are pretty long overdue ever since I've lost any interest in the Star Wars franchise curtesy of The Last Jedi and the incompetence of that movie. I honestly thought this movie was going to be just a cash in for Disney, just another story that could have not been told if not for the money Disney would gain from it. And judging from the outcome, it didn't gained too much so having said that, that might mean the movie is weak terrible and not worthy of being a part of the Star Wars canon? Not really. It's not a game changer like Empire Strikes Back or a dramatic and hopeful movie like Rogue One. Instead is a safe addition to the Star Wars franchise which doesn't do anything for enligthing the franchise or for the overall story nor for it's characters. I won't be breaking down the plot of this movie in order to point every single stupid thing the movie does, mainly because I wasn't so much invested in it in the first place and because the movie plays it pretty safe with everything: story, characters and action. I'll be mentioning though some plot points due to the importance they have on the overall impression the film made on me.First of all, which seems pretty stupid is why is the Empire in search of soldiers since it has a clone army? We know that the action takes place between the prequels and the sequels. So the clone army exists and that is probably the most effective way to conquer the universe. So why is there a Empire Army? And why is it so easy to enrol? It's more like Family Guy where Stewie asks Chris to join the dark side. I know why is that easy, so that the main character could meet his future partners. So in a later scene Han meets Chewie in a dungeon where he is thrown and expected not to last more than minutes. So he speaks wookie and Chewie sudently makes him his friend and doesn't kill him and moments later helps him escape. Hold on, I have a few questions about this situation. So, if Chewie understood wookie then and he didn't have any sign of understanding english, why later Han speaks to him in English and he still understands it? And if he somehow already understood english why was he killing people before Han for not speaking wookie and sparing him for speaking wookie? Is wookie something like a trigger or inhibitor for Chewie when it comes to killing/sparing people? Whatever, moving on... On the other hand I liked the whole dynamic with Han and Q'ra. I liked that Han as a character had a motivation, that he did all the adventure at least at the beginning of it with a purpose. So Han, Chewie and Bekett go on a mission to steal some fuel but things don't go right but then after the mission Bekett reveals only then who they are working for. And this is weak because the movie makes it pretty important who they are working for and that they are only smugglers. A very good moment in the movie was a quote Beckett said to Han about trusting no one. And what makes that even more powerful is that a twist around the end of the movie has a connection with this. That was good, I liked that! However a weak point in the movie was that the movie was pretty chaotic. A lot happened and it wasn't emphasized that is important and that the information you learn might be useful later. There were many problems occurring as the plot went along and almost every single one got a fix mainly out of nowhere. That takes me back to the point I mentioned it earlier about the story being a bit convoluted. The ending did many things good however, but on the other side a lot bad. For starters Q'ra was revealed to be working for Darth Maul which raises questions and sets up a possible sequel, which I don't know how likely would be to happen. Next, the people that were rebelling against some oppressors working with the Empire, turn out to be the Rebbels. That was a neat touch, I liked that. I also liked the way Han won his Millenium Falcon from none other than Lando Calrissian. There were also nice twists throughout the movie, though sometimes overused and exaggerated to the point where I could predict how the twist was going to turn out.Aside from that I must give credit to the actor playing Han Solo, he did a tremendous job, as did the actor playing Lando. All the performances were pretty good to almost great in some cases. The directing was a bit messy, and it shows that the movie was re-shot and changed directors. Ron Howard only did what he could to save this movie from being an actual mess. The music was really good, sometimes classic themes from John Williams like the music for the battle of the Death Star in episode IV were heard playing in moments that didn't resemble those from the original trilogy in any way. But nothing noticeable, unlike Giacchino's score for Rogue One. The cinematography decent but the story is where the movie suffers. Too many plot twists, or an overuse of them, and sometimes the story is a bit confusing and convoluted. Aside from all this, there is enjoyment to be found in this movie. Surely not the best in the SW franchise but at least at the level of the sequels. 7/10",Solo - A Star Wars Story
233,swordsnare,"Had low expectations, but...",7,17 July 2018,"Found this to be more plausible than The Last Jedi and Rogue One. At least this had more scope for a story-line than Rogue One with it's undeniable foregone conclusion.I enjoyed the film for the most part and I found the cast/characters to be more engaging than the recent incarnations in the Star Wars franchise. Rogue One's most interesting character was a robot, played by Alan Tudyk. I like all the main cast in this; so for me, it was hard not to like.Disney for better or worse, is improving on the Star Wars prequel trilogy that Lucas inflicted on fans years ago.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
234,scb_coldsteel,"Decent action movie, just not a Star Wars film",7,1 October 2018,"So I saw Solo last night. I was pretty excited about it as who doesn't love Han Solo plus I've been a fan of the Disney Star Wars films. Unfortunately though it turned out to be a very average but entertaining action film.As a movie the film followed a very stereotypical heist action formula. It wasn't bad but it was certainly something we've seen many times over. The plot points were fairly predictable which really hurt a lot of the excitement of the film. The comedy elements were also a bit hit or miss, which is a shame considering how often the film tried to be funny. Of course the film was about Han Solo, so how did it do there?For starters I enjoyed Alden Ehrenreich as a young Han Solo. He's not a bad actor, plus you did a good job capturing the look and swagger of Han. I did think the film try too hard to make us like Han Solo though. One of my favorite things about the character is that he is a rogue. I would have preferred if his origin story really showed Han Solo as that rogue bandit who could be an ass instead of as the guy that will always do the right thing.Acting wise the film also had Woody Harrelson as Hans mentor and Donald Glover playing Lando. Donald Glover was great all around. He was charismatic, arrogant, but likable. He perfectly personified Lando.Another area I was disappointed on during the movie is the amount of fanservice. At times the movie felt almost like a fanfiction there were so many references. It's almost like the writers threw them in there to remind you you're watching a Star Wars film. Sure some of them were fun but who didn't see a Han shooting first scene coming? Of course I may be in the minority here as most of these fanservice scenes received a roar of applause from the audience.As a fan of Star Wars I definitely enjoyed the movie and thought it was entertaining. I really was hoping this was going to be a Rogue One level movie, but in the end it's just an entertaining popcorn flick the tries a little bit too hard to make fans happy. A 7.25 out of 10.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
235,boydpeters,Yes it was Disneyfied but surprisingly enjoyable,7,23 September 2018,"After a lame start with a very American car chase scene, the film found its legs and delivered what we needed, a bit of enjoyment. I was highly critical of the last jedi film, but this was entertaining and a bit of good family fun.Maybe no matter what they released they were gonna cop flack from die hards",Solo - A Star Wars Story
236,loco_73,Soylo: A Lowered Expectations Story,5,10 June 2018,"The only redeeming quality of ""Solo: A Star Wars Story"" is not being as awful as ""The Last Jedi"" was or as mind-numbingly boring and flat as ""The Force Awakens"". But then, it's all downhill from there.The movie is a hodgepodge mess of mediocre proportions in so far as casting, acting, characters and character development, direction, screenwriting, shoddy special effects, and at times murky cinematography.Alden Ehrenreich was a poor choice for the role of Han, he was quite unremarkable and bland, and worse more often than not during the movie he kind of faded into the background, not something you want to see from your leading actor. As for Donald Glover he seemed actually quite underwhelming as Lando, though in all fairness he didn't have much to do on-screen. Woody Harrelson and Paul Bethany were by far the most interesting characters and strongest performers, as much as that can be said in a movie like ""Solo"", yet their talents seemed quite wasted. Emilia Clarke was good as Q'ira, but her character wasn't given much depth and served mostly as window dressing for large parts of the movie. Chewie was Chewie, though after the whole porgs set-up from ""The Last Jedi"", they tried to make him fiercer with mixed results. Thandie Newton and the new character Rio were completely wasted as well. As for L3, well let's say, that character makes Jar Jar Binks tolerable...Despite an adequate soundtrack/score (which was weirdly undermined by the always hovering presence of John Williams who basically tied John Powell's hands behind his back.) and some decently arranged actions set pieces, the movie meanders, sputters and at times stops through bad pacing and quite often choppy editing.What also becomes apparent when watching, are the two different movies fighting to jump off of screen. That is exactly one of the prominent weaknesses of ""Solo A Star Wars Story"". When Phil Lord and Chris Miller were fired, they had almost completed shooting the movie. Ron Howard was brought in to save the project. Rumour has it that he had to re-shoot almost seventy percent of it. However while watching ""Solo"", it seems as if the damage inflicted by Lord and Miller was too deep and Ron Howard couldn't or did not have the ability or vision, to put this cinematic mess back together and at the very least deliver a decent picture.I wonder, had Disney/Lucasfilm pushed the release date back to sometime in December (2018) and allowed Ron Howard to re-shoot the entire movie, if the end result would have been any better?!For my money there is no better origins story for one of the most beloved ""Star Wars"" characters like Han Solo, than the ""The Han Solo"" trilogy of novels by AC Crispin. Maybe if Disney/Lucasfilm hadn't jettisoned the Expanded Universe, sorry Legends, maybe they could have used those novels as their source material for the movie...5/10",Solo - A Star Wars Story
237,Fields201,The Better of the Disney Star Wars,7,28 May 2018,"As of this writing, the Solo movie is flopping at the box office and that is somewhat sad as despite the backlash of Last Jedi and the stupidity of the people behind Lucasfilms to the fans, Solo was actually pretty good. For a movie I was least anticipating, I kept my expectations so low (get it) that I found myself actually enjoying this one.The movie starts off with that familiar words (A Long Time Ago in a Galaxy Far, Far Away) but there is no crawl, just more words. Then the action starts and we are introduced to Han and his love interest Kira (or is it Quira?) and he steals some hover car that goes bad, and the two end up separated. The chase sequence in the beginning was pretty thrilling, but then something dumb happens. How Han Solo got his name. Trust me, it wasn't needed. After that, he meets Chewbacca and for some reason I just felt their relationship was forced and rushed and it probably was.Soon Han fights with the Imperial and meets up with Woody Harrelson (they named a character in a Star Wars movie John Beckett?) and Han finds that he and his girlfriend Thandie Newton aren't who they say they are and joins them on some train heist that reminds me of Shadows of the Empire on N64. When that goes wrong and just about everyone dies. Turns out that Woody was delivering to an evil organization known as Crimsom Dawn and the leader will most likely kill them. So the rest of the movie is about them making up for the failed heist. As seen in the trailer, there is a Kessel Run sequence, and there are other traits in the film that links up to the character of Han.I thoroughly enjoyed Solo for the action scenes (I actually enjoyed those) some of the humor was good especially between Pando and Han, and the actors were all good too. The guy playing Han Solo was pretty likable, despite not possessing any traits that will remind you of Harrison Ford, but I liked his character. But like any of these Star Wars films, there are flaws. For one, my nephew and I both noticed there are some audio issues with the film. Sometimes their mouths would move but the words don't look like they are going with what they are saying. The villain in the film is forgettable. If you ask me in five years who the villain of Solo was, I would probably thought it was Jabba the Hutt (who has only a mention in the movie). There are cameos in the film, but there is one at the end (which I won't spoil) that is total fan service and doesn't make a lick of sense other than to draw more crowds. I really can't wrap my head around it.Speaking of the ending, there's a point where you feel the movie is over and wrapping things up, only to find out there is still more. I think this is where the pacing comes into, because this ending sequence felt rushed as if they had to have some kind of ending to the film and quickly cobbled this together. The scenes following this action-packed ending was fine, and the closing of the film isn't bad.All and all, the general consensus for Solo is either average or terrible. I'm with the average crowd. It's nothing special, but if you aren't expecting Harrison Ford, then you might have a good time. It's leagues beyond The Last Jedi, which isn't too hard at this point.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
238,PCT1970,"""A Star Wars Story"" Delivers Again",7,16 May 2019,"Again the "" A Star Wars Story"" series continues to deliver. With Howard at the helm and Kasden back in the writers seat this film delivers. This film has excellent direction, cinematography, screenplay, special effects, score and acting. It's an action packed thrilling fun ride. Learning the origins of Han, Chewy and Lando's relationship is marvelous. And let's not forget the Millennium Falcon. I hope there are a few more films in this stand alone, yet prequel story, to come. The plot is crisp. clever, insightful, cathartic, gritty and has an ambiguous ending. I also hope there continues to be new blood involved in the creative side of this series. Both films in this series are the best since "" The Empire Strikes Back"" as far as the overall franchise is concerned. However Episodes 7 and 8 have returned some much needed glory to the ""Star Wars"" saga. I guess what I'm trying to convey is that in this viewer's opinion, I view the franchise as the, ""Star Wars"" saga and ""A Star Wars Story"". Both are equally appreciable and remain at the very top in the science fiction genre with Episode V of the, ""Star Wars"" saga being a masterpiece and the best ever in the genre.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
239,vailsy,"move along, move along",5,24 January 2019,"I loved Han Solo as a kid and he was 100% my hero, so I was always going to find this movie a hard watch since it's not Harrison Ford. I really tried to put that all to one side but was unable to do soMostly because of all the really pointless references to the original Star Wars trilogy, especially to Return of the Jedi oddly.. lando uses the same skiff guard disguise? Han Solo has the same disguise worn by leai at jabba's Palace. He pretends to have a thermal detonator at some point etc etc, a storm trooper says move along move along. Why?These endless references became increasingly irritating to me as the movie went on, and when I said 'punch it' out loud before they were obviously going to say the line and then did, it was all over for me immersion-wise. Then he has to explicitly say the line about the kessel run, just in case we hadn't made the connection already..The guy playing Han Solo does a reasonable job, Harrelson is great obviously, lando is very good. The game of thrones person was rubbish, I wish game of thrones actors would just stick with that franchise until it is finished. Paul Bettany? Not sure why he is wasting himself on Star Wars and avengers movies tbhThey are already setting things up for Solo 2 predictably, so Disney will further milk the franchise with their movie a year strategy. Darth Maul? I like darth maul but isn't he supposed to me a silent guy.. he says more in one minute here than he did in the entire episode one movie. It was like watching darth maul possessed by Eddie MurphyOverall there were some good moments but Solo was trying way too hard to be a Star Wars movie, and yet I never sensed that the makers got Star Wars and just tried to mimic it, unlike Rogue One which I really think got it right and didn't use or require references",Solo - A Star Wars Story

To make matters worse, they have taken over a major portion of modern entertainment, as if they are the evil and boring Sith lords of ruining your childhood and general crap.Disney's takeover of SW, along with all these other bozos, including Ron Howard, the feminist peanut gallery, the PC choir, and unnecessary characters and miscast Hollywood B-listers----- Is ABSOLUTELY killing a great saga.The great thing about a series like SW is that it was something to look forward to in days gone by. Now, you are seeing a SW universe movie released like Saturday morning toy commercials. There are way too many movies being made, trying to cash in on the SW name and nostalgia. Rogue One was ok, but not really a masterpiece, Force Awakens is a childish carbon copy of New Hope done poorly, and Last Jedi is the worst piece of cinematic garbage in recent memory. This Rian Johnson person or Kathleen or George Lucas should all be ashamed of the recent abominations being produced by the company that is also trying to buy up everything and charge more for lame crap.SOLO is ok, but you can tell it isn't that great when I have already taken a nap during the viewing, and am now writing reviews while half-heartedly watching. This is entertaining in a few spots, but it is mostly just lots of comedic chase scenes with little plot and dumb explanations for how Solo came to be the man he is. The movie feels too long for such boring and mindless programming, the lines are cheesy, the droid companion sucks, and Lando being played by Donald Glover is just stupid-- I don't care what you say-- this is another poor casting choice, though Glover does sound like Billy Dee Williams at times-- but he should, as he is an actor studying one dude and trying to simply replicate his general sound and style. He just doesn't feel cool like WIlliams, though-----And all the recent PC cheese NEEDS TO GO. Pansexual heroes? Ugly women with noses like torpedoes(Last Jedi)? Plots that make no sense? Side characters or robots or aliens that no one cares about? Constant public service announcements from lame women that don't even look convincing? Woody Harrelson being miscast in movie that seems utterly stupid for him to be in? Yes, Folks!!!!!!!! We have all that and more, in plentiful abundance, now that SW has become another empty shell full of pointless crap.

It is a mostly successful adventure with a few great action sequences and memorable new characters. ""Solo"" is fun, and exciting, hitting many of the nostalgic touchstones of those earliest films, while introducing a story all its own. Out of all of the prequels set before, I would definitely say that ""Solo"" is my favorite. It has its faults of course, but works fine as an entertainment movie with a charismatic lead by Alden Ehrenreich and an adorable cast that works particularly well. Overall, Ron Howard's 'Solo: A Star Wars Story' is a great time at the cinema and really gives Han Solo the spotlight he deserves.

243,mgruebel,Will grow on viewers,6,3 June 2018,"Having followed Star Wars since it opened in 1977, and seen the mixed results of its movies since the 1990s, I was very worried that this one might be boring because we know all the outcomes, and that we won't recognize the new Han.Well, both of those those things are true, but the film was much better than I expected. Ehrenreich seems more gullible and childish than the later Han - until he preemptively shoots his mentor at the end of the film. It's a nice nod to the original film, which was later edited to get rid of an analogous pre-emptive killing in Mos Eisley. It's the moment when Han has grown up.The story itself, although it is constructed to visit all the key moments we know about Han's early life, is sensible: escape the spaceship-building planet where you grew up although you must leave your love behind; enlist in the imperial army as the only way out; meet up a lifelong friend by accident; join a bunch of rogues that get you from one unsolvable problem to another; shortcut the distance of your greatest heist by a few parsecs by going through a no-man's land; and win your ship in a rematch once you've figured out how your opponent cheated.Glover hits the spot right-on as Lando, Clarke is charismatic as Qi'ra, yet it is clear that she is too deep in the underworld and things will not work out for her and Han in the future. Harrelson and Bettany are great as the good/bad and bad guys. L3 was not quite fleshed out (um...) well enough to make the relationship with Lando work.The score was a bit lackluster, although it brought back Williams themes at the right moments as a character was entering a new stage of development.Contrary to my expectation, I enjoyed watching it once, and might see it again someday. I do think it will slowly grow on Star Wars fans - it really does about as well as one can, given the strong constraints on writing and character development necessary for such a prequel. And having Darth Maul pop up at the end as the big crime boss, although gratuitous, might set us up for a live-action treatment of Kenobi vs. Maul two summers from now?I think the lesson for the makers of Star Wars films is to stick with brand-new stories, or stories such as Rogue One that were not explored in any detail in the canonical films or TV series.

Director Ron Howard seems more interested in only scratching the surface of the personal life of Han - which has never been as explored as I wish for - in favor of a cliched love story and space heist.

248,Ar_Pharazon_the_golden,Enjoyable without enriching the franchise,7,29 May 2018,"I had reservations about Solo, mostly regarding the point of a film about Han when we have already seen the most important parts of his story. Then again, I was unsure about the premise of Rogue One too, and it turned out to be a masterpiece. This time things didn't quite work that well, but it is still not the disappointment many were worried about. Solo is a fun film, though a little change in the characters' names and it could be completely detached from other SW films. Which is of course not a bad thing, especially with Hollywood's complete reliance on franchises. But it does make you wonder, why not go for bigger things in these side-stories after the success of Rogue One? The budget also seemed significantly smaller, although that may have been for the best, in a way. Perhaps more advanced stuff like stories for the Old Republic or whatnot are kept for after the main trilogy is finished, who knows.Anyways, in what is essentially a space heist film of sorts (I feel like the two heist efforts should have been swapped, with the train being the main one), what we get is a rather limited background of Han Solo, his meeting with Chewbacca and Lando, and a lot of references, from shooting first to iconic lines. Towards the end of the film, the first seeds of the Rebellion are planted, and we get the major surprise of the film, with the brief appearence of Darth Maul. Which on its own does seem a bit random, even if you are aware that his (somewhat unconvincing) survival from being cut in half is canon. It should therefore be clear that the plan is to bring him back on a next film.I liked: 1. the acting. Alden Ehrenreich is good (not Harrison Ford-good, but still), Emilia Clarke is not bad, as some seem to claim, Woody Harrelson is always fun. I wasn't so happy with Donald Glover's Lando, but can't say exactly why. 2. Not that I would mind a brief reference, but having nothing to do with the Force and not even mentioning the Jedi was in a way refreshing. I didn't very much like: Nothing too important on this list, but these things were slightly disappointing: 1. Jabba the Hut was only implied towards the end. I would imagine this must be the go-to antagonist in a Han Solo film, rather than a random crime boss. 2. Surely there must have been a way to include C3PO and R2D2 somewhere for tradition's sake. 3. It might just be my impression, but I feel like SW films have progressively less aliens. Everyone seems to be human and droid, with a couple background other species to remind you we are in a galaxy far, far away.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
249,AnishMisra,Solo Review,7,31 May 2018,"Solo is a film directed by Ron Howard. Amid the controversies surrounding the making of this film, I was in doubt whether this film will be good or not. The trailers looked OK and I decided not to raise any of my expectations. After watching the film, I can say that it was pretty entertaining. Plot: Explores the adventures of young Solo when he meets his friends during a heist within the criminal underworld.Story and direction: No one is a stranger from the troubles when this film was made. And this is very clearly visible during the course of the film. Some story-lines feel very under-developed and half-hearted. The story has quite a promise to be improved on as it was looking promising. But I guess Disney opted to make it a money making vehicle. The film has fantastic action scenes and was excellent when watched in 3D. I have loved Han Solo in the original films and that's because he was characterized so nicely. You kinda feel for him. But here they for opt the safe route which has no risks. Although this film does have some moment, I wanted more of them because that's what makes Star Wars exceptional. It adds nothing to the Star Wars universe to make it special. It was good to listen to John Williams' score in between the films but I did think that John Powell also has done an excellent job on his score as well.Performances: Let's be honest. No matter how many actors come and go, no one plays Han Solo as great as Harrison Ford. But if I judge independently, Alden Ehrenreich did a fine job. Woody Harrelson also did a fine job although I didn't get the mentor part that was in the promos. Emilia Clarke was good but I wanted her character explored much more. Donald Glover was perfect. Each time he was on the screen, the scene was lightened up. Thandie Newton and Paul Bettany were hugely under-utilized.Favorite Scene: It would be the first interaction between Chewbacca and Han. That scene showed why the bond between them was so strong and why they have that kind of respect for each other. Verdict: I have no problems with Disney bringing Star Wars' films each year. But just making them money spinning ventures is. I hope that Disney takes this as a warning signal and invest as much quality onto these Anthology films. Out of the 2 anthology films that have come I would say that this one is the weakest. I had a good time but that is not just enough in case if a Star Wars film. I want the experience to be remembered by me. I want to rejoice the experience of seeing the Star Wars film.I am going with a 7/10.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
250,bastille-852-731547,Amusing but Ultimately Flawed Star Wars Spin-Off,6,25 May 2018,"Lucasfilm's return to theaters this summer with its spin-off movie ""Solo: A Star Wars Story"" has occurred with fanfare and buzz--although considerably less of both of these metrics than the typical ""Star Wars"" movie. Case in point: there was raucous applause at the Lucasfilm logo and ""A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away..."" title card when I saw ""The Force Awakens"" and ""The Last Jedi"" in theaters, but zero audible reactions during my matinee showing today of ""Solo."" To figure out why this is the case (besides simply ""it's a spin-off,"") one must take a moment and do a bit of introspection. Is it because of the behind-the-scenes nightmares? No, probably not. Mass audiences probably aren't really familiar with that issue. Is it the competition of big blockbusters in the summertime? I don't think so, as big event movies can coexist during these golden, warm-weather months for mainstream moviegoing. Rather, it's likely because of the fact that the film looks rather by-the-book, and it is. That's not to say that audiences won't have some fun while watching ""Solo."" The movie has its share of entertaining action scenes. One key setpiece about a third of the way through the film, a train heist, is superbly shot and executed. It's a pleasure to watch Han spend time with Chewbacca and Lando on the Millenium Falcon. But ultimately, this film will seem more like empty calories than a full meal when it comes to audience satisfaction. It often has a pleasant taste, but you won't feel completely satisfied upon reaching its conclusion.The performances in the film tend to be on the weaker side. Alden Ehrenreich gives a charismatic but rather wooden performance as Han Solo. Some of his inconsistencies in acting technique compared to Harrison Ford can be excused due to the incontrovertible notion that Ehrenreich had incredibly big shoes to fill by playing such a beloved character, but still. Woody Harrelson and Emilia Clarke are both, unfortunately, rather forgettable. The one bright spot in the cast comes from Donald Glover, who does an outstanding job playing Lando. He is able to translate a unique and joyful sense of swagger and style into the role, which enhances the film considerably as a whole. The movie's narrative is also rather bizarre. It manages to be both structurally simple by spending much of its time as a fairly garden-variety ""origin story"" that often plays it too safe. Yet it is also situated at the intersection of intricate complexity in reference to some more contrived plot points throughout the story as well as the film's somewhat convoluted final 25 minutes.Ultimately, ""Solo"" has its enjoyable moments but is still (so to speak) perched on a rather dull bent. It's not a bad film by any means, and it's better than the prequels. But I'm not sure I would recommend seeing it in theaters to audiences that aren't hardcore Star Wars fans. 6/10",Solo - A Star Wars Story
251,cdjh-81125,How Han Solo Got His Name (And Its Nowhere Near As Cool As It Sounds),5,2 January 2019,"Similar to Rogue One I knew this movie was not a necessary addition to the Star Wars cannon but I knew that as long as it was an enjoyable and unique entry to the franchise I would expect it just fine. But also similar to Rogue One I was very disappointed with the movie I got.Solo himself was the best thing about this movie. With him being a largely supporting character to see him in a new leading role was fun to see and it was very easy o get behind him. Alden plays him very well, obviously not on Harrison Ford's level but he played him as a younger more naive character who feels natural as too his character in the original trilogy. Chewie was also everything I loved about him in the other movies, his meeting with Han was perfect and their chemistry was too notch.I also found the film to be very visually pleasing. Despite having three different directors during production the direction was ultimately just right for what the movie needed. The special effects, as always, were top notch and the cinematography created for a beautiful movie that really took advantage of all the films different locations.The supporting characters were mostly a mixed bag. Woody Harrelson was fine as Beckett but the character was fairly thin seen bland and he didn't really make the character his own. Donald Glover was great as Lando but the character was mainly just there as fan service. I didn't care for Clarke's character in the slightest her romantic chemistry with Han was almost non existent and where he character went was completely predictable. L3 was one of the worst and annoying characters I've seen in a film in years. It's very rare that I actively hope for a character to die but I was cheering for it in every other scene.The pacing was also very poor. The film has some impressive action scenes but they were spaced out between slow building scenes up to the final heist. Since I wasn't invested in the characters, the scenes building them up as characters were largely dull and uninteresting to me.The film was also largely unambitious. As many issues as I have with Rogue One I still think it justified its existence by being completely different from other films in the saga. Solo on the other hand does nothing new. It's a largely bland adventure movie that does nothing new with its narrative and characters. If it was any other franchise than I may be okay with that but since this is Star Wars I expect the movie to be an event and this film was barely memorable.Solo wasn't even really a disappointment seeing as I wasn't already anticipating the film. I was still hoping for the film to surprise me but did nothing particularly remarkable or even memorable. If these spin off films are going to keep happening Disney need to come up with more interesting stories to tell, Ive loved what they've done with the episodic movie so I choose to remain optimistic for the future despite the overall bland experience of this film.5.5/10 - C+ (Mediocre)",Solo - A Star Wars Story

The second Star Wars anthology film has great acting, (namely Alden Ehrenreich and Donald Glover) good visuals, and once again some beautiful cinematography. The story however falls flat. It's nothing terrible, it's just not to interesting, but when it does get interesting they never build on it. Ron Howard for the most part delivers a solid film in the franchise, and there's just enough good moments (The Kessel Run, Maul) to keep you invested, but the film is fairly generic. In the end the film doesn't rank among the best or the worst, but it is a lot of fun. It does make me wonder what's Lord and Miller would've brought to the table however.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

It's an adventure! It's a wager! It's some guy named Alden Ehrenreich who tries to fill shoes so big he furnishes a new, never-heretofore-before-seen, fetish: trying on other people's fancy capes.Indeed, this movie is not as much about Han Solo as it is about pretending to be Han Solo, which is about as far as Mr. Ehrenreich dabbles in his role. He is surely miscast, but then again, I had heard Zac Efron was also in the running, which, at least, might have appeased the fancy-cape community.When life sucks, you're highly more likely to take a chance, roll the dice, and accept fate's design, perhaps because death is better than a life of servitude, even if you happen to be a robot in love. With such inspiring dialogue as ""We gotta move!"" or ""You're Woody Harrelson with bad hair, right?"", the Kasdan clan have achieved the unthinkable: they made us relish and savor the dialogue from Star Wars II: Attack of the Clones.Big shoes need big feet, and big socks are close behind.

256,Solnichka,"Very good standalone film, although it does leave us with more Qs",9,3 June 2018,"Enough with all the fanbois whining about this film. Let's be honest: Harrison Ford is laughably bad in Episode 4, and by Episode 6, he was hamming it up. So, we shed a tear for him (not really) in Episode 7? This is a fun, throwback film that gives us some insight into the character background and how Solo became who he was later in life. Is it perfect? No. Is it fun? Yes. Does it answer questions? Yes. Does it leave us with more questions? Yes. It's impossible, evidently, for any SW film to satisfy anyone these days, and that's sad. Both Rogue One and Solo are better movies than Episode 7, by far, yet for some reason, the fanbois just don't want to acknowledge it. The casting choice for Solo can be debated, but in the end, the kid was alright-even if his voice needed to be a bit deeper and more soulful. But even then, it's because we still hear Ford in our minds (and perhaps in our hearts). Get over it. Chewie is great here, in terms of characterization, and the dynamics between Solo and the woman (and Solo and his ""mentor"") are just right. The Lando casting might be worse, as there is nothing about this young Lando that suggests he's tough enough to diss the Empire later on. But Donald Glover is nice to look at, and he exudes humor. The film could have used a better explanation of the Kessel Run, etc., but whatever. It's a good movie, and if you don't like it, you're clearly bitter about something that really is petty and childish.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
257,Fudge-3,Piecing together the legend of Hans Solo,8,10 June 2018,"We got a little knowledge of Solo's background from the original Star Wars movies. He's a great pilot and smuggler. His close friend and co-pilot is a wookie. He fought in the clone wars. He did the Kessel run in twelve parsecs (that is actually a distance). He won his ship the Millenium Falcon from Lando Calrissian. He owed money to Jaba the Hutt. Some of those facts get used (and explained) in the story of this movie. The rest is a roller coaster action adventure. Enough facts are left over to make another film.The story is a bit convoluted and has the mark of having been stitched together a bit (Ron Howard was parachuted in after directors Phil Lord and Christopher Miller left). Alden Ehrenreich does a passable Solo impression; never quite gets the right swagger but I think he got better toward the end of the film - perhaps due to directorship from Ron.I was surprised by the release date in Spring when the others were all pre-Christmas. It put it up against a bunch of super-hero movies and might explain why it didn't make big money. Maybe Disney didn't what to put it up against Mary Poppins Returns that has a December release date. Perhaps someone saw, 'Returns,' in that title and made a mistake.Not the best of the recent re-boots of Star Wars but a good one. I saw it in the theatre twice and both had lots of spare seats. A shame because I think it deserves better.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

I'm a big fan of the first three movies (ie, episodes 4, 5, and 6) but this suffers too much from some really poor acting. I think it was made especially disappointing because it really could have been good and interesting. Having said that, it's enjoyable enough to have on in the background while you're doing something else. I think it would have been better if they hadn't tried to make this movie about Han Solo and just made it a ""Star Wars Story"", about some unfamiliar character.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
259,Svenstadt,Craptastic latest installment to ruin a classic!,3,27 May 2018,"The feeling of this movie is that of the criticism of Episode III: Revenge of the Sith - that they go through all this just to tell you, 'yeah, so these are the characters, and this is how they met one another, and yada yada yada, these things happened, and that explains why things get like this in the future"". My goodness the acting was TERRIBLE!!!!!! I hope I never see Alden Ehrenreich in another movie again. I heard before seeing it that they had acting coaches on the set during filming - no need to tell me WHO needed that!!! Emilia Clarke - terrible role, the only semi-good acting was Woody Harrelson. So I saw this at the drive-in, along with Avengers:Infinity War. This crap-fest was first. 
Disney needs to STOP MAKING SW MOVIES!!!!! You cannot bring back a classic like that, as I've said before. Star Wars is like the Terminator - it only works if enough of it is left to the imagination; ergo, the Terminators that go back in time are the only good ones. (Yes that includes T3 which I thought was decent). Not even worth your time.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
260,joshbarton15,Decent but that's it unfortunately,6,28 May 2018,"Ever since Disney purchased the Star Wars franchise, we've had a new film every year since 2015, whether they continue the Skywalker Saga or tell stories of lesser known characters from the Star Wars universe. Solo: A Star Wars Story certainly isn't about one of those lesser known characters, Han Solo being one of the most iconic characters ever however, it has never seemed as anything more than filler to me. Whether it be behind-the-scenes unrest or a weak marketing campaign, the build-up to this just hasn't made it feel like a Star Wars film at all.Long before he joined the Rebellion, Han Solo (Alden Ehrenreich) saw the dark criminal underworld as a playground. A journey of love and adventure brings him across his future copilot Chewbacca, Lando Calrissian (Donald Glover) and the Millennium Falcon and it's a journey that will change his life forever.Let's talk about the major doubt cast over Solo long before it was even released; Alden Ehrenreich. Many, including myself, didn't think he would pull it off and it wouldn't be anything more than a glorified Han Solo impersonation. I love being proved wrong and in this case, Ehrenreich should silence all of the doubters because he is very good in the titular role. He has the cocky swagger and bags of charm however, it's the naivety he shows that makes this worthwhile, he's a con man sure but he's rough around the edges and not quite the full package we first saw in Star Wars.Han's partner in crime, Chewbacca, is an extremely welcome presence throughout. I mean, who doesn't love Chewbacca? The way they're introduced to one another is great and things really do blossom from there, the forging of their friendship being one of the highlights of the film. Donald Glover's portrayal of Lando Calrissian is hotly anticipated and, while he is good in the role, there is nowhere near enough of him in the film and of a standard to make me say I'd watch a series of films about Lando. Emilia Clarke is just about ok in this but she starts to look out of her depth when up against better actors, and it really shows. Woody Harrelson, Thandie Newton and Paul Bettany make up the rest of the cast but unfortunately they'll be forgotten as characters in no time at all, particularly Bettany's villain. Oh, and Phoebe Waller-Bridge as L3-37, Lando's droid copilot, is one of the better yet more irritating things about Solo.As for the story here, it never really felt as if Solo took off as a Star Wars film for me. Sure, there are many references (THAT cameo causing much confusion amongst my audience) but there wasn't enough of a wow factor at any point to make me sit back in awe. There are a couple of decent action sequences where the visual effects are expectedly great however, rather like some of the characters mentioned before, I feel they'll be easily forgotten when looking back through the Star Wars films. Ron Howard has done a solid job in directing Solo but I'll always have the thought of what a Lord & Miller Star Wars film could have been like.Music has and always will be a key part of any Star Wars film and it's safe to say John Powell delivers on this front, the inclusion of one of my very favourite pieces of music from The Empire Strikes Back in a sequence where they have to make a quick escape in the Millennium Falcon filling me with sheer joy. There's a distinctive sense of grit to Bradford Young's cinematography throughout, things getting a little too dark in places, but it suitably reflects the criminal underworld the film takes place in. I just pray for anyone who watches this film in 3D when things get really dark.So there we have it, Solo: A Star Wars Story isn't a disaster nor is it a masterpiece of cinema. It is fun in parts but it tends to drag a little also, particularly at the beginning. We have now seen Han Solo make the infamous Kessel Run when I would have preferred to keep that side of things stuff of legend. As much as I love seeing Star Wars films so frequently in the cinema, I just hope they move on to explore stories and characters that can breathe even more life into the franchise.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

The trailers weren't too impressive and rather than focusing on a new cast of characters like Rogue One, this one would tackle an already established one.I am glad to say that I was very pleasantly surprised upon watching this on the premiere. Alden Ehenreich really nailed the Harrison Ford impression, and feels very reminiscent. The rest of the characters are all great as well, whether they are only in the movie for a while or for its entire run.The effects are incredible and feels very much like the gritty and practical feeling of the Original films. The action scenes are, of course, great as well. (The battle of Mimban is a standout)Like Rogue One, this spinoff tries to do some things different as well - not using an opening crawl and giving us some rather unexpected twists; I particulary liked the fact that Han Solo was an Imperial soldier for a while, and that Solo was a given name.The latter is an important note for the title of the movie as well, which brilliantly plays on both the character's name and how he's alone.Overall, a very fun ride, I can't say whether this one or Rogue One is better, but it gives great hope for future Star Wars spinoffs.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

266,paulijcalderon,No happiness or anger - Just an average feeling in between,6,24 May 2018,"""I have a really good feeling about this!"" That's the line that Han says in the trailer that's playing in the cinema before the movies. And I remember my friend leaning over to me and saying: ""I hate that he says that so much"". There's no denying that all of my friends felt that this movie was not needed, me included. But we got it nonetheless and I always wanna give every movie a chance. ""Star Wars"" has been a very meaningful and inspirational saga for me and my family since ever before I can even remember. When Disney took over I held out hope that the new adventures would give me some joy of revisiting these characters in this world that I love. Unfortunately, I have been feeling more and more let down about the whole situation. I'm not gonna get into it here because there's too much to discuss. And there's already plenty of people who have voiced their displeasure of the mishandling of this property. The fear of us getting a new SW film every year is that the specialness will fade away. That they no longer feel like the events they were and that SW becomes over-saturated. It's been talked to death on other platforms, I know. I'm gonna get to what I thought, since that's why you are reading. Well, I did my best to go in with no expectations. Just to be open with the whole ""expect the worst and hope for the best"" type thing. And yes, you feel the ""Star Warsy""-ness, but I couldn't help but to leave the cinema less happy than you should watching a SW movie. The action set-pieces, the references and the practical effects are appreciated. But the core of the story needed more.Every beat of what you sort of expect to happen happens. Chewbacca and Han's friendship was what I bought the most. It honestly felt pure and sympathetic. They got that right. Of course, the heist stuff is fun, but the care for the people and story? Other than the fact that you already know some of them based on previous films, you don't feel the importance of why this needed to be told. It becomes an un-eventful film in the series that really adds nothing new to what you already know about our main characters. It's nice to see Lando because you know him, but in the end he is just there in surface-level form. Nothing against Donald Glover, he was a great casting choice. But if this was your introduction to him or Han, then I'm not sure how much you would care. The reason I felt I could care a little was based on knowing who Han or Lando are in the other movies. I will again say that I enjoyed when the sense of urgency kicked in. You know, when a mission or quest is presented and you go: ""Yeah, I'm ready. Let's go on an adventure"". It's unfortunate that the adventure leads to no special impact. Creature effects and designs felt organic to the world, so that was nice to see. I bought the underground gambling places a lot more here than I did in ""The Last Jedi"". Here they blended in to the world and didn't distract. Everything looked and felt like it belonged in the SW universe. Although I would be happy if they didn't over-relay on everything that's nostalgia. Some new element would be nice to introduce. But this movie lands in a safe zone where no big leaps of risks are taken. The problem is that it failed to engage me in the actual story.The movie didn't make me feel happy or angry, it's a feeling in between. It's probably just fine, but you won't remember most if it. An average sci-fi movie that doesn't do much more than to be mildly entertaining. I have nothing against Ron Howard. I feel more bad for him because he had to take over mid-production and fix what he could. I respect the commitment in his effort, but I think I would have done some changes to make sure it got a warmer reaction. How about Alden ""Would that it were so simple"" / ""The rules don't apply to you"" Ehrenreich? Well, he's not a bad actor, kids. Leave him alone. The issue is that I just couldn't buy him as Solo. I'm sorry, Alden. You did your best, but you seemed more like another character. There's glimmers towards the end that remind you that it's supposed to be Han, but again, it's surface level. Not to say that I didn't think his character was like-able. No, he has charisma and humanity about him. But it's sad that it's never to the point where he earns the role and you go; ""That's Solo!"". I'm gonna end the review by saying that I'm conflicted about it. There are fun scenes to enjoy, but the the bigger picture is... kind of ..uninteresting. I hate to say it, and the worst part is that I'm starting to feel ready to let go of the new SW. If ""Episode IX"" doesn't give me the motivation to see what happens next, then... What's the point?PS: There's a cameo at the end and it was actually the most unexpected and exciting part of the movie. But it's also a little bit like: ""Oh, I'm happy to see you.. But, what.. Why again?""",Solo - A Star Wars Story
267,gerry_barnaby,SJW Pandering Medicroe Starwars Film,6,24 May 2018,"Likes: As a film review I honestly can not support this film, I wish I could but I just can't get behind it. Don't get me wrong this film is watchable but as a star wars film, this one is very mediocre at best, not just with dialogue but with character development as well. The film its self is a star wars film it feels like star wars film, some visual effects are good, to be honest, Donald Glover playing the younger Lando Calrissian was the highlight of the film along with Emilia Clarke playing Qi'ra old love interest of solo. Paul Bettany wasn't that bad at play the gangster type boss Dryden Vos with a ruthless nature, but even these performance couldn't save this film.I went in with an open mind but sadly this film was another disappointing Starwars film that no one asked for, with the way Disney is handling the star wars franchise is just disappointing this is a blatant cash grabbing film. 
Dislikes: Don't get me wrong here Alden Ehrenreich did ok with this role, he did in some points of the film act like han solo, but other time he didn't. This is because his character was so underdeveloped, not just in the writing but just the way he is portrayed as well, I can honestly say it doesn't help that Alden doesn't look like Harrison Ford's Solo.If this was gonna be a reboot of Han solo ya maybe this film could get away with a standalone film that has no connection to the past saga, but because it connects to Han solo past which is apart of the old saga this film just feel underwhelming.All the issue this films had in making this film really shows in the way this film has been done.The dialogue alone is cringe-worthy which is a Blatant SJW mentality especially the dialogue coming from L3-37 character voice by Phoebe Waller-Bridge, Every sentence she making in this film is an SJW propaganda speech its cringe-worthy at best with the way it put across.As ive said before some visuals were ok, but I did notice and few moments in the film the visuals weren't that great like the film has been lazily done, special with it plot as well. If anyone says this is a masterpiece is iver fooling themselves or trying to defend a shockingly medicroe film.I don't know who this film was written for but it certainly wasn't for a star wars fan, casual fans may like this film, but the real hardcore Starwars fans I can't see them like this film, not with the way this film has been made.This for me growing up on star wars since the late 70s to 80s, the star wars I knew is truly lost to greed and propaganda pushing.Overall: Medicroe sjw agenda pandering film, Some good acting, but an easily forgettable film",Solo - A Star Wars Story

But at least it sold plenty of toys and made a fair amount of money for Disney.Firstly, Han's legendary name is given by some random Empire Guy. I figured if he had no last name, he would come up with it himself like how Batman came up with his name on Batman Begins or on the 1989 movie? Yet, even if this random guy gave it to him when he was working with the empire, why does Han keep it if he later on dislikes the Empire. Finn on Force Awakens still doesn't call himself FN-2187. Yeah, Finn sounds similar, but he doesn't like his code name anymore. Disney, make up your mind!Lando Calrissian was always one of my top favorite Star Wars characters, and I cannot believe how they screwed him up on this. This whole movie is set up to make Han look like the greatest. And Lando is this side-character, who actually sleeps with a robot that he owns. That's creepy. Very very creepy. That's as creepy as...I don't even want to mention the movie. 😖😖I always thought Lando and Han were equals, but this movie makes Han have an arc and Lando look like a joke. I was laughing when L7 died because she/it was not like able at all.The movie seems keen on explaining every last detail. Because that's how much Disney wants to claim that they own the franchise. It's like buying a meal of the dollar menu at McDonald's, then spitting on it to make sure no one else eats it.Han gave Chewbacca his nickname because he didn't like saying his full name. What? I always thought it was just a loving nickname that was given to Chewie that his close friends call him.
The Falcon's blank space on the front is because of an escape pod that's missing. That's not true either. There are three Falcons in Revenge of the Sith right before Obi-Wan lands on Utapu.

There were many confusing reviews, lot of them one star out of 10, but lots 10 out of 10 as well. The one review that helped the most was one that said the movie was a fun adventure movie with lots of action but don't look at it as a Star Wars Story as advertised. Rather it is an adventure with a couple of links to Star Wars.Having watched the movie I totally agree. Of course knowing all of the Star Wars movies added something to this story it can also stand on it's own.I thought Woody Harrelson was perfect for the role he played. Alden Ehrenreich fit the part of Solo very well. My only big complaint about the movie was how dark it was. Not dark in the sense of being sinister. Rather the way it was filmed and/or edited made the visual presentation very dark. It was as if someone had put a filter over the lens or the movie theater didn't have the brightness knob turned up far enough. It actually made the movie a bit difficult to watch and it was disturbing. My wife even leaned over to me and commented about how visually dark it was.

However Solo is a pretty entertaining movie, but you wouldn't be missing much if you skip it, unless you plan on watching just for that effing brilliant cameo at the end of the film.The problems Solo has are similar to that of Rogue One. Other than Han and Chewie, who was both great, the other characters are dull and uninteresting. Most of the characters that you seen in marketing, are barely in it, and when they do, they're not all that exciting to watch. The film also has no heart. Most of the Star Wars movies has an affect on you, this does not. No one is going to remember this film in a few years time. At at times, the film felt like a fan film. The pacing is all over the place, at times the film is slow and drags, and at other times, it jumps very quickly between parts of the story, to make it feel like its always moving. But the thing that I hated most of this movie, is that stupid droid side story. Thankfully that story didn't play out long. But really #droidrights? What next? The villains of the film are also boring as well. Paul Bettany is only in the film for a few minuets, and many of the characters are scared of him, but other than a cool looking scar on his face, he is dull, and nothing happens with him on screen that you didn't predict.Solo was still good. Donald Glover was good as Lando, even though he had next to nothing to do, Woody Harrelson was entertaining as the underdeveloped Beckett and Emilia Clarke was good as Qi-ra. But Alden Ehrenreich is the one who sells the film. Obviously you can't ever top Harrison Ford, but Alden did a much better job than I expected him to. His body language was perfect, and his voice sounded on point at times. Chewbacca was also great in the film. I also liked his entrance and the developing friendship between him and Han.The CGI and action scenes in the film are brilliant, I couldn't fault them, along with a very grounded and realistic fighting scenes. The film looks gritty and grey, a warm welcome to a Star Wars movie. Another surprise was the soundtrack. John Powell is amazing as the films composer. Bringing back epic scores from the other movies, all while bringing his own take on the most iconic part about Star Wars. George Lucas once admitted that Star Wars owes much of its success to its music, and this film is no different.Overall, Solo is good, but you won't miss much from it. The film is poorly paced, with good action and a great performance from Alden Ehrenreich. But I wouldn't rush to see it. Even if you want to stick with it only to see a certain prequel bad-ass appear at the end. (wink, wink)",Solo - A Star Wars Story

282,angiris,"An above average star wars story. Not great, not bad, just an okay entertaining time.",6,26 May 2018,"Okay so, first things. The cast is good. Acting is good. Everyone is treated with respect and given some cool scenes and worth to the film, unlike TLJ. Furthermore, the movie isn't ""feminized"" or anything alike what the Info Wars ""soy boy"" band wagon jumping fools say it is. Soy isn't even feminizing either ( proven false 8 years ago) but what do you expect from Info Wars followers... So yes. Nothing bad or politically tempered about our characters except Lando who has a crush on his droid ""girlfriend"" but it didn't play a big part in the film though. Personally, if the droid was like a pleasure droid with a woman face from games like SWTOR then I could possibly understand it but this thing is like as droid as it gets. But hey. Whatever lol. I honestly dont care. Lando was cool. We got some funny scenes between him and Han too including pazzak Card games happening which is a first. So. Is Alden able to take on the role of Han ? Sometimes yes, sometimes... meh. 
All in all, I personally dont really care. Harrison is done. We're getting the movie whether we like it or not, so I'll just take it for what it is on this. 
Would Ingruber have been better? Possibly. Who knows. Its not relevant anymore. So thats the end of that. Alden did okay. Now. In general I'd say the movie was okay. Some cool scenes, some nice background revelations ( hans last name, his blaster, the falcon etc) Unfortunately, its a rather generic plot. Not particularly mindblowing. Cool, sure, but not more than that. 
Solo is a mix of 3 Things. Western heist genre + Guardians of the Galaxy + Star Wars. 
And the execution has both hits and misses. But in terms of what we got as a finished product... I found the film to be entertaining more than bland feeling. 
Both were however present. It felt a bit rushed at times, occasionally it was as if the action was non-stop over the story. But yeah... heist movie. But what angered me the most was the same thing that continues to appear in modern star wars films. The Music... John Williams has lost it. The Solo theme sucks. Its so damn generic and out of place.
Honestly... ever since Williams stopped working with George something has just been missing. Idk if its coincidence or if Williams has just grown old but its over. Dear Disney and Lucas Film. STOP RE-INVENTING THE WHEEL! DO NOT MAKE NEW STAR WARS MUSIC. Just recycle the old. ESPECIALLY for these prequel films. 
The only good music this film had was the tracks it borrowed from the original trilogy. But then in between scenes as tension was rising they CONSTANTLY.... had the bloody Solo Theme playing over and over and over and over.
I get music is repetition but F#CK... get a grip. It was as if you had 3-4 music themes MAX to work with for every single action scene in the ENTIRE movie. and you kept overlapping them together into this monstrosity of auditorial malfunction. just use the old music, please... Thank you. You're absolutely destroying the immersion whenever you have the original trilogy tracks play that make us all nostalgic but then play something TOTALLY different 1 second later, overlapping because your guy in charge of sound design hasn't a god damn CLUE in HELL what star wars is supposed to sound like. This angers me... because if the music was better I'd have enjoyed the film far more. 
Rogue One had the same issue. The music in the new trilogy has the same issue. Its distorted, weird, non-star warsian. Rogue One's music was a disaster. It wasn't even music. It was noise.The original tracks weren't just Star Wars or made for the original film
THEY WERE PERFECTION. And you dont touch that... so STOP IT. Rant over. 6 out of 10. Above average film. Heist western star wars Flick with some good scenes, fun throwbacks and such. The cast worked well together and all in all its a star wars story for western / die hard Han Solo fans and pretty much nobody else. But honestly. had they just bothered getting the music right I would've enjoyed the film far more. But maybe I'm just a hardcore star wars fan on this topic of music. I grew up with the originals and prequels and love both to death. 
Is this film worth your time? Sure. If you dont mind what I listed above too much and can keep an open mind to the recasting of Han Solo.
Otherwise watch it online for free. But one thing thats worth mentioning is the fact that there film ends on sequel bait concerning Darth Maul. Yes, Maul appears in a hologram, talking to Qira who tells her to come to Dathomir. Maul is older, still menacing, got his mechanical legs from the looks of it, and the full Black robe. So Im definitely interested in seeing where they'll go Next. Do I want I sequel, you ask? Yes I actually do. But only if they fix the bloody music issues. Seriously. Its destroying all of these films. 
Rogue One's grand spectacle of a super positive orchestral melody as the star destroyer got smashed into was so UNBELIVABLY out of place. They just dont understand how to handle the music anymore IMO. But yeah. Seeing more of Maul in the future would be quite epic. Maybe even in the Obi Wan movie. 
6 out of 10. I'd like to see more. Something less generic than a heist ( I dont know why they could've just smuggle something instead of spending time with trains and stuff) But anyway. I hope we see more.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

286,sjarja,i seem to miss something...,5,31 December 2019,"All in all, this movie was not boring. With that out of the way ... it was also not remarkable in creative storytelling.I can only compare it to Rogue one and Star Wars 1 and 3 (have not seen other Star Wars movies) - and off of that list .. i liked Rogue one a lot more, while Star Wars 1 and 3 had a very different tone .. as if they were totally different movies altogether.So Solo tells the story of a guy named Han. It reminded me a lot on Firefly - but i have to admit that cpt. Raynolds is a lot more charismatic than this Han. Also, there is little chemistry between the protagonist and his crew - well, due to the fact that he has no crew (one of the huge draws for Firefly, where the crew is everything)It is a typical heist movie in the end - with double crossing, outwitting and high stakes - or something. The problem i had was that i had no idea what they were all on about. They steal glowing blue fuel or so. But in a universe where everyone flies a spaceship - that stuff can hardly be too valuable (one of the things i seem to be missing...)I was also told that the big bad guy in the background was supposed to be Dath Mule from Star Wars 1 (again, i seem to be missing something because he did not only fall down one of those bottomless shafts, but was also cut in half if i remember correctly... )Aside from all those - i guess .. easter eggs - the movie was OK. A typical crime drama set in the Star Wars universe. A sort of coming off age story for a young criminal.conclusion: i was not bored but will certainly not watch it again. The visuals were nice, the acting was alright but the story was a bit too predictable.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
287,eve_dolluk,Ridin Solo,7,24 May 2018,"So just got back from the cinema after watching the opening midnight showing here in the UK. So its all about Han Solo, where he came from, how he became a smuggler and of course that Kessel run. So we best start with Solo played by Alden Ehrenreich. I don't think I have seen him before in anything but that doesn't matter. While he did an overall good job of playing Han Solo he doesn't quite capture the smaller details of the Harrison Ford Han Solo, However overall he does a good job. The leading Female in this case Emilia Clarke as Kira did a great job and was very good casting. Her role isn't one of super action woman ( and I don't think she suits that type of role as she is a little bit short and not so athletic ) 
Instead she plays a girl trying to survive amongst the lowlifes of the galaxy, She isn't good but she also isn't bad.... a bit like most of the characters in the film.Donald Glover plays Lando Carlrissian and again he doesn't quite capture the details of the Billy Dee Williams Character he still does a solid job and has a major part to play here. His side kick droid voiced by Phoebe Waller-Bridge provides a few laughs but I found this character a little bit annoying and a bit of copy of K2 from Rogue one but in female form. She did kick of a cool and fun scene with some other droids though. Woody Harrelson plays Becket, A smuggler and leader of his group and the man who takes Solo under his wing. Woody was very good playing rogue and brigand in a rag tag bunch struggling to get by. His partner Val is played by Thandie Newton in a smaller role than expected and was kind of average.Chewie for the first time was not played by Peter Mayhew and instead by Joonas Suotamo but it is the same Chewie we all love ( plus there is no love connection in the film ) I think Chewie was my favourite thing about the movie. You saw more humanity and honesty in the big walking rug than probably anyone else. The bad guy amongst all this is Dryden Voss played by Paul Bettany and he kinda Hams it up as the erratic and slightly unhinged leader of Crimson Dawn a group of Pirates/Gangsters. His role is fairly small though Overall the film gives us insight into Solo's past and kind of explains why he is who he is but without a huge amount of depth. For me the best parts of the film were when we saw the friendship between Han and Chewie developing and their coming together on the Millenium Falcon and it all ties into the Originals nicely. The movie is a lot of fun and nice little prequel but lacks any real depth or emotion to be one of the classic Star Wars films but it provides 2 hrs of solid entertainment within the Star Wars Galaxy and I can't ask for more than that. I preferred Rogue One as it was more heroic and tragic whereas this is more of cool space cowboy/pirate film and that's not a bad thing at all.Overall I give it a 7 as it was a well made and entertaining prequel to the Star Wars Saga. I also get the feeling that we will be seeing more characters from Solo in the next ' A Star Wars Story ' Franchise but I can't say more than that without spoiling but be excited Star Wars fans !!!!!",Solo - A Star Wars Story

289,hooma814,Slightly better than expected,7,14 March 2020,"Solo does what most star wars films do, it has cheesy one liners and a predictable script. But Solo has enough new plot going on to keep it interesting. Conveniently, all the back story that was ever necessary was neatly tied up in this film all within a few months life span of Han, how convenient! Such as, when Han gets the falcon, meets chewbacca, how he gets the name Solo, what completing the Kessel run or whe he becomes a pilot.Once you get over the fact that this movie is going to be like all the other Star Wars films its actually quite enjoyable.Woody Harrelson was awesome as always. Hes one of my favourite actors and does not disappoint in this. Emilia Clarkes character seems a little random, why does she not appear in later movies? What happened to her? Why is Darth Maul alive!!! He definitely did not survive being chopped in half. It almost felt like they wanted to go for the big shock of Emilia betraying Han so much to not have a cliche finish where she dies, but for the sake of the plot I think they should've just killed her off.Overall an enjoyable movie, one that is easy to fall asleep in and not miss much.

290,margulanabutrlov,Solo: A Star Wars Story Review,8,23 March 2019,"After young ""Scrumrat"" Han (Alden Ehrenreich) escapes the slums of Corellia, he vows to one day return for Qi'ra (Emilia Clarke), the love he left behind. After, that is, he's somehow managed to get himself a ship and make a heap of money. Along the way, he takes up with a gang of criminals, sets out to pull off a huge heist, and makes a big, furry friend.
It's fair to say that Solo flies into port rather less burdened by expectation than recent Star Wars movies. Anyone who pays even the faintest bit of attention to the behind-the-scenes goings-on in Hollywood must be aware that its original directors Phil Lord and Chris Miller - the guys behind The LEGO Movie and 21 Jump Street - had a creative disagreement with Lucasfilm, leaving the film in the safe-as-cotton-wool-padded-houses hands of Ron Howard (a close chum of one George Lucas). As a result, you might be forgiven for expecting this origin story for the Galaxy's greatest scoundrel to end up predictable and not entirely thrilling.
Well, the good news is that Solo doesn't feel overly compromised or noticeably stymied by its production snafus. It's a slick, swift-footed adventure which plays like a planet-hopping heist movie, and one which glides a long way on the charm of its leading man.
Before Lord and Miller departed, they definitely made the right choice with Alden Ehrenreich (previously best enjoyed on-screen as the smooth-faced Western star in the Coen brothers' Hail, Caesar!). With a glowing smirk and a knack for the wisecrack, he fills Harrison Ford's boots with rogueish panache - even if young Han himself spends much of his time here as the passenger in other, older characters' schemes.
Not that he has much time to rest on his charms. Howard and father-son team writers Lawrence and Jonathan Kasdan cram a hell of a lot of action and locations into the considerable running time. We zip from the industrial nightmare world of Corellia (which looks like Peaky Blinders' Birmingham executed on a planetary scale), to a World War I-ish combat zone, to a mega-mountainous landscape where Han and his new crew - led by the scurrilous Beckett (Woody Harrelson) - pull off a high-speed over-and-under-monorail job. There's a lot of spectacular imagination on show here, albeit thoughtfully framed in reasurringly familiar ways, as we appreciate further glimpses of life under the giant jackboot of the Galactic Empire. (Interestingly, we learn that the Imperial March is actually the theme-music for the Empire's holographic recruiting ads.)
It does, however, all whip by a bit too fast and comes a little too tangled in its crosses and double-crosses during the closing act. Interesting new characters come into, and head out of the frame a little too briskly, whether it's Thandie Newton's sultry career criminal Val, or Fleabag's Phoebe Waller-Bridge as the right-hand droid to Lando Calrissian (Donald Glover), who believes in equal rights with organic life, and is utterly convinced Lando has a thing for her (intriguingly, neither the script nor Glover's performance do much to convince us otherwise). And even Lando himself isn't given as much screentime as Glover deserves; the ol' smoothie feels rather sidelined.
Thankfully, however, Han's closest companion is given exactly as much attention as you'd hope for. And we're not talking about Clarke as Qi'Ra, who sadly turns out to be the film's weakest link; as a romantic pairing, she and Ehrenreich sadly just don't pop. You know who we mean, and the fans will feel generously serviced by the sequence in which Han and Chewie (now fully in the hands of Finnish actor Joonas Suotamo) first meet, tussling in a mud pit before joining forces against their tormentors. Watching their increasingly syncopating relationship develop is one of the movie's biggest joys, Chewbacca quickly falling into place as Han's towering, hairy conscience.
Then there's the other relationship in the movie: Han and his beloved ship, the Millennium Falcon. Solo is as much the Kessel-running starship's origin story as it is the title character's, and without wanting to give away too many surprises, it's great to see how the Falcon looks before she is turned into a hyperspacing bucket of junk: all shimmering and white and with an escape pod neatly filling the gap between those two front prongs.
Ultimately, this is a different kind of Star Wars film to any that have gone before, with only hints of the main saga's bigger fate-of-the-galaxy picture. And while that means the story lacks the depth some might crave, it still offers plenty of fun, and (impressively for a prequel) the odd surprise along the way. Punch it, Chewie.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
291,ajzeg,"Initially, I quite enjoyed this movie.",6,15 September 2019,"However, on a second viewing, I noticed a serious problem. It is the inverse of the problem I have with Rogue One: A Star Wars Story. While that movie's first two acts are a slog to get through, the third act is excellent and it ends off on a very high note. With Solo, the first two acts are great, but it really falls apart in the third. The pacing slows down to a crawl and you're just waiting for the movie to end at that point. They really should've found a way to streamline the last act to keep up the energy of the rest of the movie. That probably wasn't possible because of the extremely extensive reshoots, though. Honestly, I'm surprised this movie is as good as it is and not a Suicide Squad-level disaster. Overall, I'm sure this movie will be in my regular Star Wars rewatch rotation, but it's one of my least favourites. I like most of the movie, but the ending kills it for me. Which is worse? A boring movie with a great ending or an exciting movie with a boring ending? I really don't know.

If you showed this film to me even a couple of years ago and told me that I was going to enjoy it much more than I enjoyed Episode 8..... ooooohhhh, boy....To me its most glaring problem is its casting. As the late, great John Huston said, 90% of directing is casting. So I can't even really blame Ron Howard for this problem because by the time he took the helm on this project he was probably just casting minor players. Donald Glover does a fairly good job of capturing Lando's voice and mannerisms, but you can't prevent yourself from thinking that someone could have done a far better job. Alden Ehrenreich is tolerable as Han, and he manages to capture some of the character's essence, yet you think constantly that someone could have done a far better job. Even the great Woody Harrelson sometimes seems out of place in this film.It often dragged so much that I considered walking out-- partly because I accidentally left my whiskey flask at home; I knew that it would have enhanced my experience.I don't really know how anyone could hate OR love this movie.

With the disaster stories in the news about the film's production behind the scenes, with Phil Lord and Christopher Miller being sacked to make way for Ron Howard directing, having to reshoot 70% of the film, according to reports, I think it's fair to say that audiences didn't exactly have high hopes for this film.Let me start by saying it's not god-awful. It's decently put together and some of the action scenes are fun to watch. The downside, however, lies with the characterisation of almost all of the ensemble. Ehrenreich's Solo attempts to flee from the slums of Corellia with his girlfriend, Qi'ra. The Empire has total control of the galaxy. Solo bribes an Imperial officer to give him safe passage through the 'spaceport'? Qi'ra gets captured leaving Han with his own goal of becoming a pilot so that he can return and rescue her. He signs up for the Imperial Navy and three years pass. He crosses paths with a crime gang led by Woody Harrelson's character and from there, Solo is introduced to Lando Calrissian, Chewie, and a couple of other morally ambiguous figures.If I'm being honest, the film is just bland. It plays the nostalgia card too often and there's very little originality to it. Young Solo is far too naïve, considering he grows up to be the roguish character we saw in the original series. Sure, he pulls off scams and heists but he's lacking a particular element. Qi'ra as a character, is compelling in theory, but the execution is another story. Emilia Clarke never stood out to me as a phenomenal actress but she did OK as well. Her character arc was pretty predictable though.
Donald Glover's portrayal of Lando was decent enough although it seemed at times that he was trying too hard to do his best Billy Dee Williams impression.Woody Harrelson's character was again, predictable. Morally ambiguous smuggler who is apparently a mentor to Han? Yeah, I ain't buying it.
The majority of the characters are tolerable, but good god, whose idea was it to put an adamant equal rights activist droid into the mix? L3-37 was insufferable. Jar Jar Binks levels of terrible. It's no mystery that Kathleen Kennedy has shoehorned constant feminist SJW messages into the Disney Star Wars films, but this was too on the nose and in-your-face. I cheered when her character died. (spoiler)The plot is a bit paint-by-numbers. Hyperspace fuel is the McGuffin of the film and everyone is going mad for it. That's essentially the story. It doesn't really add anything to the overall lore apart from forced identity politics and some really corny moments, to the point of cringe induction. Also, they shoehorn in the golden dice from The Last Jedi (not shown or referenced from the original series so this is a pointless Disney addition).Again, it's not disastrous but at best, it's mediocre. This is the fourth Star Wars film churned out in two and a half years. Star Wars fatigue is definitely kicking in for some people. If the box office numbers are anything to go from, it seems likely that the future of Disney's Star Wars doesn't seem too bright.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

299,tstudstrup,It ought to be 1.7 stars average,1,27 September 2018,"And that would still be way too much. This turd of a movie deserves zero stars. The people that give this movie anything above 1 star are either 12 year old boys or trolls or people paid by Disney to make this movie look good on imdb. As usual however, do not believe the hype!! This is is really, really, really bad!!I can't think of a single redeeming thing to say about this crap. Its not only the worst of all The Star Wars movies. It makes the prequels to the original trilogy look like great movies inm comparison. It's one of the worst movies ever made. It's a completely unneseccary prequel that nobody asked for. It's way too long. I'ts boring. Alden Ehrenreich is not Han Solo and never will be. He doesnt have Fords back then good looks and great smile. He is short in height compared to Ford. He does a decent job however (if you just dont think of him as Han Solo) with the horrible script and the bad directing. I'm almost beginning to think George Lucas would have done a better job, directing Alden to give a perfornce closer to Fords in A New Hope. He directed Ford to play Han as the charming scoundrell that we love. Aldens performance makes Hayden Christensen performance in Revenge Of The Sith, look really good. That should tell you how bad this is. Emilia Clarke, all though gorgeous and sexy, is a terrible actress. Having seen her in this and Terminator Genisys as a terrible Sarah Connor, she's really only good in Game of thrones. Its a good thing that show has made her a millionaire. Maybe she will retire early so we never have to watch another dreadfull performance from her. If you wanna see a good leading lady in Star Wars, watch the just as gorgeous but much better actress, Fecility Jones in the best Star Wars movie ever: Rogue One. Woody Harrelson is a very good actor, but not in this crap. Donald Glover as Lando Calrisssian is as bland as Alden. At the end Darth Maul appears as a hologram. Appaerently he survived being cut in half by Ben Kenobi in The Phantom Menace. This will only make sense for people that has seen the animated series. Steer clear of this.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
300,mickdansforth,My New Favorite Star Wars movie! By Far!,10,26 May 2018,"With the Kasdans writing and Ron Howard directing, this movie lands hard in the sweet spot of everything you could want from a Star Wars movie, if you don't need Jedis.The movie starts on Corellia, and not the fairly idyllic Corellia of The Corellian Trilogy by Roger MacBride Allen, but a Corellia where Han's father labored making Corellian Light Freighters until he was laid off, and where orphans steal for Proxima in order to survive and escape is nearly impossible. We all know Han enlists with the Empire to become a pilot, but with this we get to see a new side to the Imperial structure not previously seen, and that is easily something spectacular in this well worn galaxy, as we have seen so much of the Empire.This movie does a lot with a few throwaway lines from the original trilogy, like the Russ Manning comic strip that showed us what happened on Orde Mandel. But it goes so far beyond that by showing us the life events that left Han Solo the jaded rogue of the original trilogy.It has been since the mid nineties that I last read the psychedelic adventures of Lando Calrissian by L. Neil Smith, so until I just looked it up I was thinking that L3-37 (Leet?) and Vuffi Raa were the same character. And they kinda sorta are, but at the same time they are not. Lando, L3 and Chewie are next level awesome in this movie. Thandie Newton, Woody Harrelson, Emilia Clarke and Jon Favreau bring the goods too.The big question is Alden Ehrenreich because Harrison Ford became so beloved that he was able to bring down $20M a movie for a while there. The answer is yes. Yes Alden Ehrenreich did his homework and embodies Han Solo the way we need him as an earlier version, and he is arguably better because he actually wants to play the character and didn't take the job just so he could kill off the character like Ford. Part of the original charm of Star Wars in 1977 and then Alien in 1979, was that they showed us galaxies that were lived in and cobbled together. Everything wasn't as shiny and new as previous sci-fi. This movie gives us the dirt, the mud, the criminal underbelly and a bit of snow. Slavery is a real element and most everyone is stuck in the hard knock life.All of the action sequences are thrilling. The effects and costumes are all excellent. This movie has it all. There is a surprising and disturbing call back to the Clone Wars and Rebels cartoons. This movie tells a discreet story in the larger Star Wars galaxy while at the same showing how it fits into the larger tapestry. Anyone talking smack about this movie hasn't seen it and has an axe to grind because Kathleen Kennedy and Disney hired a black man to play Lando or some similar nonsens. You don't want to miss this Star Wars movie.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
301,ryanwinning1,A Very Blah Story,4,22 January 2019,"I sat through the whole movie just shaking my head at how hard this film tried to be like Harrison Ford's rendition of the scenes where he played Han Solo, in the original Star Wars Movies shaking my head at how far off everyone was, and then I just about fell out of my chair when I saw the credits. Ron Howard was the director of this movie! I was completely shocked because typically, he does a better job of building character throughout a film, but this one fell very short.
The actor that plays Han Solo appears to be so short on life experience. I would assume this kids parents are very rich and put him in acting school as a boy. The word silver spoon comes to mind. The kid practically had a silver spoon hanging out of his mouth as he tries to crack jokes the same way Harrison Ford did as Han Solo, but he completely missed that the tone of Harrison Ford was bitter and sarcastic. This kid that plays Han Solo appears to not have the life experience to understand the angle that Harrison Ford's sense of humour came from.
Woody Harrelson is the one bright spot in this movie, and without him it would be a complete snooze fest. Woody's personal flair just kind of makes things interesting somehow, and I'm happy they chose him rather than the typical straight edge type actor they usually pick.
I think Disney has done better with the Marvel movies they've made, but all the Star Wars movies I've seen from Disney have missed the mark for me, and this one was the worst yet!",Solo - A Star Wars Story

I loved the cast, the cinematography, and the overall job Howard did with this project. It tied into the Star Wars universe but still told it's own story which is hard to do with these iconic characters. Some may call it a cash grab, but I can enjoy movies for what they are, and I try not to be so pessimistic about every single little detail like most of the Star Wars fans you will see comment on here. They really ruin everything. I would normally rate this movie a 7/10 but when I see these spoiled crybaby fans (who are probably commenting from their Mom's basement) rate it a 1/10, I figure I'll try to the level out the score a bit.Please go see this movie with an open mind and just enjoy the spectacle. Don't let a fan base that is out of touch attempt to ruin it for you. I think you'll find it sets up some sequels well too. Enjoy",Solo - A Star Wars Story
305,SpoodermanDerp,"Solo: A ""Skip This"" Story",6,23 May 2018,"Gone is the time when an aloof and mysterious character like Han Solo can stand on his own. When the pure imagination of fans opened up countless debates on how the Kessel run really went down, or how Hans eventually won the Millennium Falcon and eventually became a staple of his character. The hard truth is, fans and casual viewers already knew these milestones in Han's story happened and will happen, so the only thing that mattered about this movie was, how was it going to happen? For awhile, the magic of Star Wars was that of not knowing what to expect and getting to analyze an entire lived-in universe by yourself or with your friends throughout the years. With Solo, that magic is lost. You know you will be dealing with limited stakes since Solo and Chewie are pretty much okay and surely alive after this movie. You know that it will hit the basic story beats of how he becomes an outlaw, a rebel and eventually the iconic smuggler with a secret heart of gold we all know and love. You know he'll get the Falcon, you know he'll end up with Leia anyway. There's no mystery here, everyone knows the answer and we're all left with awkward suspicions about how things will play out.  Alden Ehrenreich does a, for the most part, fantastic job as Han Solo and he makes the role his own, probably one of the better parts of this movie. Lando (Donald Glover) and Chewie both get their moments, and also stand out in their roles. Beckett (Woody Harrelson) and Qi'ra (Emilia Clarke) weirdly fall flat as the new additions for Solo, aside from an obvious wisecracking droid to entertain us and give us some emotional moments, the two side characters that are meant to be the people that influence the title character are bland and uninteresting. Beckett seems to be just a ticket for Han to go follow him wherever he goes only to just ride backseat in the mission in the end. While Qi'ra plays the love interest of Han who we never get to know much about aside from pointless and explicit exposition. She also has a vague and messy arc that makes not just Han, but the audience confused as well. At one point, you're not sure where her allegiance lies, what her motivations are and what drives her to stick or stay away from Han.  Moreover, the story really doesn't aim to tell a properly structured narrative, instead it felt like a ""Han's Biggest Hits Montage"" all through out. Now this is not to say that it's hard and impossible to tell a proper movie about iconic persons/events we probably know about and/or have learned about and theorized ourselves. Rogue One (2016) was able to do it to an admittedly better extent, and quite masterfully in the James Bond reboot with Casino Royale back in 2006. To use Casino Royale as an example, it's a perfect story that shows how James Bond became THE James Bond we know and love, the commanding, suave and rough 007 agent. When the movie starts, he's not yet quite the Bond we're used to know yet, but what happens in that film contributes to why he changes. Then in the end, that's the only time we get the iconic line of James Bond introducing himself because that character has earned it through the context of the film. 
 While Solo tried to achieve this same level of success, it falls hard on its knees really hard in the process. The definition of ""context"" the filmmakers had in mind with Solo was just throwing in fan service after fan service of what made Han Solo iconic, but we never really see why THIS character in THIS film in particular earned that iconic status. Han is basically the same person from the beginning till the end, compare this to James Bond in Casino Royale wherein his relationship with Vesper and how it ended changed his character forever, inevitably giving strong emotional and narrative context as to why he became how he is. This is never explored in the film and it instead becomes a by-the-numbers, monotone, and dull looking film.Verdict: 6/10",Solo - A Star Wars Story
306,WooderIce64,Good in its own right.,8,2 August 2018,"Solo was that franchise movie that no one asked for. No one asked for Rogue One either, and look how that turned out. Solo is an origin story for Han Solo, one of the most beloved characters in the Star Wars franchise. Before release, there was drama and controversy, neither of which are good. Directors Phil Lord and Chris Miller (of 21 Jump Street and Lego Movie) were fired, and there was no trailer until Super Bowl LII, 3 months before release. It didn't spell good things for the movie, and it was a complete box office failure. Still, I think it's a good movie. It's about how Han Solo became a smuggler, and his interactions with the deadly Crimson Dawn gang after being kicked out of the Imperial Academy, as well as how he obtained his iconic ship, the Millennium Falcon. It also features things that were referenced in the Originals, like the Kessel Run. While some might argue that this is superfluous, making an origin story for Han, it's as much about the world of Star Wars as it is about him. For as much as it explores Han Solo's backstory, it also explores how the criminal underworld of the galaxy works, as well as life under the Empire's reign. It shows us new aspects of the Star Wars story that wasn't seen in the main saga.Alden Ehrenreich was criticized for not resembling Harrison Ford as much as ""young Han Solo"" should. He takes a while to get used to, but he clicks into the role eventually. The rest of the cast is generally good. Donald Glover (also known as Childish Gambino) was perfect as Lando. He looked, acted, and sounded, like a younger Billy Dee Williams. The other characters aren't much to report on. There's Woody Harrelson, who plays a dude named Beckett, but it's hard to not just see Woody Harrelson. Qi'ra is the love interest, and there's not really much to report on her without giving too much away. And then there's L3. Yeah, I don't think anyone was too upset when she died around halfway through the movie. Enfys Nest looked pretty cool. Anything further is spoiler territory. Paul Bettany is Dryden Vos, who's the gangster in charge of Crimson Dawn. He made for a good villain, although he didn't get enough screen time, and Crimson Dawn sometimes seems like better movie material than Han himself. Even though it's not a character, the Millennium Falcon almost felt like one, given that we see where it came from, how it changed between this and A New Hope, and it was nice to see it, even though it's still in the main story.The way it's filmed and the way the visuals are makes it feel like Rogue One, giving the Star Wars anthology series a vibe of its own. The visuals, as one would expect, were spectacular. Say what you will about the new movies, but they're currently 4/4 on visuals. The Rogue One comparison is interesting because ow fhat Rogue One and Solo have in common: they're not trying to be a story of Jedi and Sith like the rest of the Star Wars movies are. They're anthology films. They happen alongside the main story. Rogue One was about the early Rebellion, and Solo is about the criminal underworld. They both also allude to other things from the franchise. For the most part, Solo's references and allusions are a welcome part of the movie. Solo references Jabba the Hutt, for instance. It also has some iconic Star Wars symbols like stormtroopers and star destroyers as well. Spoiler: The absolute best scene in the movie was the Darth Maul scene. It was way out of nowhere, totally unexpected, and gave a bit more screen time to one of the most popular characters in the franchise. Although I think it's a generational difference: those of us who grew up with the Prequels would appreciate it more.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
307,williamsonandcompany,Not a great filmed picture,6,2 June 2018,"The story was ok and good that it filled in the back stories. Not really buying the whole Maul character coming back. Why wouldn't the dark side feel the presence of this character, don't they all sense each other? The real disappointment was the lighting was bad in the film and you can't see much of what is going on. Not the worse Star Wars I've seen, lord knows Last Jedi took that award home but not worth owning. If you haven't seen it I'd say wait a while and see it later when the theaters make more money on the film than the studios so that way they won't make another.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
308,Joejoesan,One big turd - 5/10,5,17 May 2018,"Let me first say that I'm a very big Star Wars fan. I saw the first one as a teenager back in 1978, had to wait a very long time for the new ones and thought that both Rogue One and The Last Jedi were brilliant. This one however isn't. I even think that Solo: A Star Wars Story is the worst entry in the series.Disney has bought the rights to Star Wars and in order to get their investment back they must earn money: I get that. So they made a sequel trilogy to Return of the Jedi and are planning a brand new one in the future too. I get that as well. At the same time they produce stand-alone movies so they can have a Star Wars movie every year. Logical. But why choose Han Solo as a subject, a project that can only fail?Making a Han Solo movie without Harrison Ford is a big risk. Who can follow in his iconic footsteps? Actor Alden Ehrenreich does a decent job, but he can't make us forget the original actor. It's not even close. Trying to see the movie as a non-Han Solo movie isn't possible either, because you're constantly reminded that Alden is supposed to be the real deal. I don't know how many times the famous dice (Solo's lucky charm) is shown to proof this or when Alden tries to smile like the famous scoundrel.Then the story... Well, somebody must have asked the question: ""Okay, we'll do Han Solo. Which elements of his past can we use? How he met Chewbacca, how he won the Falcon, the Kessel run... well, they all appear in the story. Wow, that's some lazy writing!
And remember that famous scene in the Godfather part 2 when Vito arrives in America and somebody asks him his name? Well, there is a similar scene in this movie explaining Han's surname. What, has he lived his life all the time without one? No, it doesn't look like a tribute. Again, it's just some lazy writing.Visually the movie is also disappointing.
The first part, when we meet Han and his girlfriend Qi'ra for the first time, even looks like a middle-of-the-road Direct-to-DVD film. There is a nice scene however when Han and his crew must rob a train (as shown in the trailer). To me that was the (visual) highlight of the movie.In the end there's an effort to make this stand-alone film fit more into the Star Wars movie canon by showing a famous character that will probably play a big part in the sequel. This surprise comes out of nowhere and it just doesn't work.
And yes: sequel. Depending on the success two sequels will follow. At the end of part 3 Han will probably walk into the cantina on Tattooine to meet Obi-Wan and Luke for the first time. So yes: that doesn't happen in this movie.It's incredible that the great Lawrence Kasdan (Empire Strikes Back, Raiders of the lost arc) co-wrote this story. There are absolutely no surprises in there and the character build up (of Solo and Emilia Clarke's Kira, pardon: Qi'ra) is very poor at times. The scene in which Han speaks Wookie (!) is an all time low in Star Wars history (only to be outlowed by the ""Yippie"" from Episode 1 and ""Nooooo!"" from Episode 3). And a robot with an attitude? Come on! Been there, done that.I think Disney - like so many Stormtroopers - pretty much misfired with this movie. Who the hell okayed this script? Donald Glover is charming as Lando, but could have had more screentime. Woody Harrelson and Paul Bettany always perform well and Emilia Clarke... well, the movie stops just when her character becomes interesting. Her character could be fascinating in the sequel (that hopefully will not be made).Ever since I heard of Solo: A Star Wars Story I had a bad feeling about it. I wasn't wrong. Solo is a movie made for all the wrong reasons (money) and should have never been green lit. It's just Star Wars overkill.
Let me end with something positive: in the movie theatre there were also fans who did like the movie, so there's a slight chance that I'm too harsh for the film. So if you really want to see it: go ahead!Oh yeah: there's no aftercredits scene in this film!",Solo - A Star Wars Story

It's a wonderful little adventure in Star Wars, and maybe my favorite film in that galaxy since the original trilogy.For all the fears about Alden Ehrenreich, he does a fine job by me. Oddly enough, if there's one member of the cast who doesn't quite disappear into the role for me, it might be Donald Glover as Lando Calrissian. He does look fantastic, though, and there are some great Lando in-jokes for longtime fans.In my estimation, Solo is as good as anything Lucasfilm has made since being acquired by Disney, and one of the best Star Wars films period. I notice that the featured review is from a longtime fan who hated this; I loved it, and I hope that they keep making films like this and Rogue One, because they feel like real living, breathing Star Wars adventures to me in a way that the new TFA/TLJ trilogy just doesn't.

314,eparazak,"It's generally a fun movie, but it does have its problems.",7,1 June 2018,"Solo: A Star Wars Story was directed by Ron Howard and stars Alden Ehrenreich as young Han Solo. It's about the adventures of young Han Solo, who goes on a heist mission. Along the way, he encounters new allies like Chewbacca and Lando. Originally, this movie was to be directed by the duo Phil Lord and Chris Miller, but were replaced by Ron Howard after some disagreements. If they did stay cirectors of the film however, I think it would've been much better.The movie starts out with the same problem as the beginning of Rogue One; its beginning is rushed. I wish we could see more of Han Solo's early life as a hunter as a way of establishing his character as a smuggler. I was very lost in the beginning since it felt too rapidly paced. It was hard to tell what was going on throughout the first 15-20 minutes.After that mark, the movie does get more interesting. As a Star Wars film, it does have a western vibe, which is something I can appreciate. This make it both unique and fun to watch. An example of a scene that feels like it came out of a classic western is when Solo and his crew are invading a train in an alien world. While I do like this style, we must keep in mind that the Star Wars franchise is a space opera, so this differentiation may alienate some of its viewers. With that in mind, it does make this movie somewhat lack the Star Wars vibe.Of course we see how Han met Chewbacca, Lando and how he got his hands on the Millenium Falcon, that's a given. I think that the scene where Chewbacca met Solo was a bit rushed, after all it was a scene from the beginning. I thought Lando's introduction was quite cool itself, otherwise.Solo: A Star Wars Story may have its flaws, but it's still a fun, action packed and thrilling prequel for Han Solo's character. I like this movie even with the flaws it holds.7/10",Solo - A Star Wars Story
315,Better_Sith_Than_Sorry,Two Things...,8,26 May 2018,"First, any review with a 1/10 rating....ignore it. Very few films are so atrociously bad to deserve such a rating, and ""Solo"" is certainly not among them. The reviewers stooping to this level are clearly childish and juvenile and quite simply, are not being fair. And they are not worth your time. As much as I disliked ""The Last Jedi,"" it still had a few decent parts that I couldn't rate it a '1' either; TLJ is probably about a '4.'Second, any review stating ""Solo"" 'wasn't necessary' or 'no one asked for this' - ignore it. Here's a question...who 'asks' for any film? Who 'asked' for Rogue One, for example? For that matter, who 'asked' for the original Star Wars back in 1977? Anybody? Surely not the people making this idiotic comment. It's entertainment, people. If you think you might be interested, then go see it. If you don't, then don't go see it. That's not a hard concept to understand. The film - or any film, really - doesn't need to justify its existence for you, or prove its worth. BTW, ""Solo"" was in fact George Lucas's idea....he began working on it BEFORE he sold the franchise rights to Disney. So if you think this is a Disney 'cash grab' - guess what, you're wrong. Go tell George Lucas that ""Solo"" was unnecessary.Now, on to the film...I will admit up-front that I would not have gone to see this if Rian Johnson was involved with it. ""The Last Jedi"" was disappointing on so many levels, I was ready to swear off any future SW films. I am still not sure if I will see Ep. IX....but when I heard Ron Howard was taking over, I decided to give this a chance. And am I glad I did!Is this film perfect? No. I can do without Lando's droid, for one. There are a few plot twists at the end I am still trying to work out in my head. But overall, a really good, action-packed film. And guess what? None of the characters float though space. No eye-rolling ""Poe"" attempts at humor. No character-trashing moments that make you wonder what you're watching. So for those who were bitterly dejected by 2017's ""The Last Jedi"" - and I was chief among them - I am telling you, it is safe to go back in the theater again.""Solo"" does a great job introducing the 'origin' stories of the iconic characters Han Solo and Chewbacca. In a way, it's sort of like the Prequel Trilogy, which gave the origins for many SW characters, but not those two. So this film fills in the gaps for them, as the prequels did for Vader, Obi-Wan, C-3PO and many others. For any SW fan, that alone should be enough to entice you. In addition, you get numerous new characters, worlds and adventures....what you'd expect of any SW film, really. And the special effects are very well done too. There is one sequence during the Kessel Run that is particularly memorable, I might go back for that one scene alone. Lastly, and even though this is a SW film, there is pretty much nothing here having to do with ""The Force,"" which I think works to its advantage. So you're not asking yourself 'how can Rey do this?' or 'why didn't Snoke realize that?' etc. etc. Nothing like that to bog the film down. So, overall....a very good film. I am not yet sure where I would rank it among the (now) 10 SW films, but I think I can safely say it's in the upper-half. That would make it Top Five.8/10. A breath of fresh of air, and highly recommended for SW fans - especially the recently-disappointed ones. Would I watch again? (Y/N): Yes, for certain. Maybe even this weekend.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
316,rowanmaillot,Ron Howard's take on a Star Wars movie..,8,6 June 2020,"And it's actually pretty decent. It's a great visual experience with some great performance and absolutely rad action-scenes. I guess it's cool to hate on Ron Howard's work for some reason and I don't see the reason why. The guy made a great movie about driving, a great film about parenting, a good Dr Seuss adaptation and he made some.... other movies. If you view this as an action movie, it's pretty awesome! The Chewbacca character I thought was great, we get introduced to Donald Glover's character in a poker game which I thought was cool.I went into this movie expecting it to be a decent action movie and I can tell you, it is more than just a DECENT action movie, it's not great, it has a lot of problems, but what movie doesn't? It has some plot holes, but then again, most Scorsese movies don't even have a plot and I know I am making some pretty deadly comparisons here, but it's just a very solid movie. Even though I give this the same rating as Phantom Menace, I believe this movie is better. Once I watch this again in the future, I'll add more of my thoughts, since it's 12:40 at midnight and I can't really watch it right now.84%",Solo - A Star Wars Story

318,juliendussault,Do believe the bad reviews. Fantastic movie that gives hope yet for the Star Wars franchise.,10,27 September 2018,"This film received terrible reviews when it came out. It was called ""unnecessary"" and people even had the gall to call it ""a waste of your time."" You will not be wasting your time watching Solo A Star Wars story. It's the most Star Wars film I've seen since Empire Strikes Back, it was written by the same screenwriter, so of course it's going to be more Star Wars than anything Disney has put out so far. Before you move on from this review open your mind and consider the possibility that this movie is necessary. Solo has all the qualities of Episode IV and V. It's light, and dark; a perfect balance to what makes any film great, and what made Episodes IV and V so great, and memorable, and believe me this movie is memorable more memorable than any Star Wars films has been in a long time. The true reason this movie failed was the fact that Disney is so afraid of the hate of closeminded, dumb fans, and the loss of money, that they're willing to not give us the trilogy we so deserved. We lost something amazing with the reaction to this film by butthurt fans who want it their way or the highway, hopefully we'll get it back, and hopefully Disney will grow a pair and take a chance on a Han Solo trilogy.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
319,Eclectic-Boogaloo,An insignificant entry into the Star Wars franchise,3,30 May 2018,"""Solo: A Star Wars Story"" added nothing of any significance to Han, Chewie, and Lando, as they were established in the original trilogy. It merely used the characters and lore George Lucas created to tell a fairly paint-by-numbers story. There are references and nods galore, some of which i liked, but the new faces playing the characters I knew and loved muted the emotional impact of those moments. The performances were fine, but Harrison Ford and Billy Dee Williams ARE Han and Lando. I never bought Alden Ehrenreich and Donald Glover in their roles. Sorry.Another big problem i had with Solo, is that like all the other Disney Star Wars films, it was heavy handed in pushing strong female characters. Across the board the movie was chock full of empowered females of every age, race, species (even a robot). Now I generally love strong female characters, and female driven films, but a movie like this needed to have a proper villain and a hero or anti-hero to takes him or her down. This film had neither because all of the potential villains were undercut in one form or another by a strong female character as Han, you know the guy who the movie is supposed to be about, was reduced to being an observer. My point is that the supporting female characters were built up to the detriment of the movies lead, Han Solo, and by extension the detriment of the movie. That's poor storytelling.Anyway, if you have moviepass or are bored I wouldn't try to talk you out of seeing Solo. But I would strongly suggest you skip it. On top of everything I've already said the movie isn't so big in terms of scale or visuals that you'll regret not having seen it on the big screen.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

Characters are well developed, therefore, with thoughtful dialogue and a mostly intriguing storyline that delivers interesting twists. Comedically the film works, providing relief from a serious bound plot. The visuals and sound are mesmerizing when in tandem, also. Truthfully, the emotional depth is only slightly better than average and the overall sequence is not the most exciting Star Wars has to offer, but the film presents an overall fun origin to such a beloved character. Ultimately, a worthwhile feature.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
322,shannen-l-c,Mildly entertaining scifi-action movie,6,2 June 2018,"I feel the first important thing for me to make clear is that I'm not an avid Star Wars fan like many reviews are likely to be. I've seen a handful of the Star Wars films, but have never religiously followed them. I consider it to be a good franchise, but over-hyped and not really my ""thing"". I tagged along with my dad and brother to see Solo and went in with no expectations. I'd heard that the movie has flopped in the box office, but general opinion didn't seem TOO bad. The first thing that stood out to me is the brilliant decision to cast Alden Ehrenreich as Han Solo. His charismatic, chaotic personality perfectly encapsulated Han's personality and Alden's Han didn't feel like a separate character from Harrison's, like I expected it would be. Similarly, the rest of the cast were great, and this, in my opinion, is the strongest aspect of the movie. My main issue with this movie is that it didn't keep me engaged or interested (or my dad and brother, for that matter). There were certain action scenes that had me glued to my screen, but the rest of the time I was struggling to keep my focus. It seemed to lack any real direction or plot - there were no stakes, nothing to invest in and it felt very samey and incredibly predictable. The action scenes felt like they were thrown in purely to disguise the fact that there was no real substance or story. I can't speak for Star Wars fans, but I also feel like certain events that fans likely imagined (such as the first time Han and Chewie met, how Han found/came to own the Millennium Falcon and how he became Han Solo) were disappointing. It felt like the ideas had been thrown together and not given much thought, and I can imagine for avid fans of Star Wars, they might be disappointed by some of the explanations provided for these things. The characters themselves were okay - neither amazing nor terrible. I did thoroughly enjoy the dynamic between Han and Chewie (as I have in all previous Star Wars movies I've seen), I also enjoyed the dynamic between the crew with Lando and L3. However, I didn't quite understand what place Qi'ra (Emilia Clarke) had in the movie and the romance between her and Han felt as though it was just THERE, but didn't really have a purpose. Overall, Solo is another predictable and unoriginal action scifi to add to the over-saturated collection of uninspiring and boring movies that are being released lately. The movie does benefit from a strong cast and fantastic action scenes, but unfortunately, it does not have any real plot or substance. For this reason, it left me feeling slightly underwhelmed and grateful that my dad had paid for the tickets instead of me!",Solo - A Star Wars Story

324,sujanfaster,Ridin' Solo,7,27 May 2018,"Another year. Another Star Wars. Who would have though 10 odd years ago that Star Wars franchise would be up and running again. After the roaring success of The Last Jedi, Solo: A Star Wars Story slightly diverts the focus to another origin story. This time it's of the famous and charming pilot Han Solo. Solo is more of a drama and adventure film rather than a Star Wars' spinoff. It is indeed refreshing to watch it that way, but hardcore Star Wars fans may not feel the same connection as usual. This movie follows Han Solo's path in becoming what he became. It shows us how he teams up with his best sidekick Chewbacca and of course ends up riding the famous Millenium Falcon. While Solo battles for his love and life while he gets involved in a heist. On the quest he meets his so called acquaintance Lando Calrissian and his mentor Beckett played by Woody Harrelson. The film ends at the early days of rebellion formation while Solo continuing his journey to Tatooine (which is probably the only strong link to the Star Wars franchise).Solo, although entertaining, lacks the emotional strength that makes a Star Wars franchise. Alden Ehrenreich who has a very big shoes to fill does well. He might not carry the SWAG of Harrison Ford but he has his own charisma. Donald Grover as Lando Calrissian has a very cool screen presence. Woody Harrelson as Beckett suits the role for perfection. However Paul Bettany and Emilia Clarke are underutilized. Solo: A Star Wars story is not a disappointment, but it might not go down as one of the classics in the Star Wars' franchise.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
325,joncheskin,Star Wars Western,6,3 June 2018,"Solo: A Star Wars Story is the movie that gives us the back story of one of the most famous characters of the original franchise. It is actually pretty good. I have seen many reviews of this movie that dislike it, but I think that the problems stem from a few sources that are not the fault of the original film. First of all, the audience clearly has some Star Wars fatigue, with the sheer number of movies released in the last few years. Second, some of the performances are weak, especially Emilia Clarke, who seems a bit wooden and dull for the interesting role she is required to play. Lastly, and I think most importantly, Solo is a pretty conventional Western, which is a new take on the Star Wars franchise.Taken on its own merits however, Star Wars as a Western is fun--with train robberies, gun fights, poker games, and betrayals (lots of them). The criminals in these movies can be heroes because they are essentially screw-ups who can only extricate themselves from their problems by ""doing another job."" The result is a fun romp with a fair amount of both comedy and suspense. I rather like this as a diversion from the epic main series, and it gives great insight into the rogue that became the great General Solo.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
326,cyifly-2,Great Addition to a Great Franchise,8,31 May 2018,"Solo: A Star Wars Story is a real treat. There were great characters, lots of action, plenty of story to keep up with, lots of twists, and plenty to get behind.It certainly keeps holds your attention and worth your time if you are a Star Wars fan. It did run a little long, but never felt like it was too much. If I were to say anything bad about it, I would say I was scratching my head over the decision to bring back a certain character who was killed off very early in the Star Wars franchise. The timeline just doesn't seem right. When you compare Solo's age to when this character was ended, it doesn't seem possible for them to be alive at the same time during this movie. Other than that -- Nice job.On a side note -- There is a lot of hate floating around for this movie for no real reason. Harrison Ford can never be replaced. Han Solo is an iconic character and no one can ever replace the original man. Don't expect the new to either. Also -- Every Star Wars film can't start, end and be directed the same way. There has to be variation. This isn't a Star Wars movie... It's a Star Wars story. Don't compare it to Star Wars nor hold it to such high regard as the originals and just go with it -- You'll have a lot more fun with it if you do.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

Oh and it does kick in alright.Men are weak, women are strong, men make bad choices, women save men, men are gamblers women are fighters and so on and so on. What a big awful yawn.Ok we get it Disney. You are injecting feminism into our favourite movie saga of all times. Maybe Mickey Mouse will show up wearing a Darth Maul costume but in rainbow colours. That would be something. Maybe Minnie Mouse is stronger, better, more accomplished, more worthy to be called a real Jedi warrior too.By now, the only people giving a flying Jedi crap are 6 year olds and people selling star wars fluffy bunnies with light sabers toys at Walmart.

You should be ashamed and wave the right to be called artists and film makers. Green screen toy selling film makers, yeah right. Your time will be remembered as a backround of fakery and computer image peddling of nothingness. Just like a big green screen set.

330,c-kelsall,We need some fanboy perspective here,8,4 June 2018,"Whoa, horsey! I want to ask all the SW fanboys (and girls) why the long faces? Is Star Wars fatigue setting in? Is it just Disney hate? I'm not sure. But one thing I am sure of, while Solo: A Star Wars Story and its predecessor The Last Jedi were lacking in some areas compared to Episode VII and Rogue One, they are a damn site better made, scripted and acted than those awful prequels produced by, lest we forget, George Lucas. Have all the fans forgotten how godawful episodes I-III were? Disney wasn't responsible for those. Forgive me if this cultural reference goes over your heads, but I'm sure there are equivalent examples everywhere: it's a bit like a Manchester United FC fan complaining that the Glazers bought the club and ruined it. Okay, it happened, but the club is still successful, so get over it and move on. Enjoy the performances for what they are etc. Anyone who thinks Marvel's products are greatly superior is basically mistaken, but you generally don't hear Marvel fans complaining about how it's a giant commercial machine that threatens to wreck the artistic integrity of the comics on which the films are based.
Having said all that, I do get why some of the more eloquent and thoughtful critics are down on Solo. If you're going to slate a movie, you owe it to other fans to clearly state WHY you don't like something. I can see why some feel the reference points from the original Star Wars were clumsily handled and lacking in soul, like when Han meets Chewy for the first time. My main beef with Solo was actually the sound editing, which particularly early on was so poor I could barely understand anything anyone was saying - the qualities of the script at that point I am therefore unable to comment upon. Later on, the sound quality improved and I thought it was enjoyable enough. The ubiquitous comic relief robot was sufficiently different from previous iterations to be worthy of its place, nicely performed by Phoebe Waller-Bridge. The principal supporting cast were all good, though I agree that an obvious weakness of the plot was a lack of real menace from the villains. Solo himself was okay, but he's no Harrison Ford. HF's star quality shone through from the first frame in Star Wars. This was always going to be a particularly tough nut to crack, and while not entirely successful, if you set aside your rose-tinted specs for a couple of hours and just view Solo as an unconnected sci-fi film, you should enjoy it at least a little bit.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

332,J-bot6,After school special,6,13 April 2019,"While watching this film, I couldn't help but feel that it was more like a television show than a motion picture. It doesn't really strike me as a Star Wars movie. Instead, it's something different.Although the cast members did a really good job with what they had to work with, this came off as yet another prequel that lifts idea after idea from the movies that preceded it. For example:
'Got to get off of this planet'.'I've got your money'.Thermal detonator.'Watch this' followed by turning the ship sideways.The 'Fed to the beast in the pit' scene.'I don't have it here, now'.Homing beacon attached to the Falcon.Interrupted kiss.The 'envoy with slaves' routine.As for the elements of the story that actually were somewhat original... those too were problematic. In particular, the liberties that were taken with the character of Lando. Despite this, Donald Glover did a great job of duplicating Billy Dee Williams' line delivery and mannerisms. Too bad the script and its interpretation of his character didn't rise to the same level.There are a number of twists in the story that are a bit too pat. And relationships that clearly took a long time to develop only took mere hours or a few days to develop in this film's interpretation of Han. Chewie, and Lando's earlier years. Too many things just seemed a bit off -- enough so that I can't accept this as canon.Finally, there's the score. Pretty much everything that wasn't composed by John Williams just didn't fit. It put me in mind of Back to the Future. Don't get me wrong.... I like Back to the Future. But if that's what I wanted to see, I would have just played that film instead.I don't envy Ron Howard for the task of trying to patch this movie up and complete the project. Clearly, he and the actors did the best they could with what they were provided. However, it just does what so many of the recent films have done to this saga. And that is, they've made it a smaller and less awe-inspiring universe with changes to characters that go a long way to demystify something that should never be demystified.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

We cared for every character and their arc, even though the story suffered from massive plot holes common to the franchise.We find out how Solo made the Kessel run in under 12 parsecs, and we see his rise from humble beginnings to becoming a smuggler. Clarke, Harrelson, and Glover are top notch, and definitely made the movie more enjoyable than we expected.

337,hiraishinnojutsu,One of the Star-Wars-verse movies that I had a little to no enjoyment of watching,7,24 May 2018,"The movie (almost) nobody ever asked about is the movie that (almost) nobody would ever go watching. Seriously, there were only 3 people when I watched it yesterday in the studio (me included). But, that doesn't mean it was bad (doesn't mean it's great either), it's just, well, everybody knows that it would be much less ""star-warsy"" than the others. First of all no one, in their perfectly healthy mind, would ever picture young Han Solo or Lando Calrissian like either Alden Ehrenreich or Donald Glover. That's why the issue of miscast had been sprouting continuously until the movie arrives at the theater (with a very high chance it'll continue until this movie is completely forgotten). When I saw it with my own eyes, I stopped wondering why people think this matters. Young Han Solo doesn't act, behave, or sound like the Old Han Solo, same goes with Lando. If some people from either Disney or Lucasfilm would argue that it's hard finding someone with the charisma and the look of young Harisson Ford or Billy Dee Williams, then why the hell should they force their way into making this movie?Aside from that, the action sequences are pretty awesome to the point that I think not all of the 250 million dollar budget was being wasted (aside from the reshoot factor), some of it must have gone into the wallets of the hardworking CGI team that had spent days and nights for months to animate one of the coolest heist movie scene of all time, in outer space!! Oh, and don't forget about the World War I and II vibe planetary invasion scene at the beginning of the movie which is, in my humble opinion, very realistic and explosive compared even to the other war-on-ground scene in any other star wars movies.so, whatever you (star wars fans or general audiences) would think about this movie after watching it, ""Solo: A Star Wars Story"" helps the Star Wars cinematic universe to expand into the unknown cold, dangerous, bizarre and the wildest territory in the outer space no one would even begin to think of. it's a thrill ride, just not ended well.

338,Jackblyth8,A Seven Card Stud,8,25 January 2021,"The story that centres around the livelihood of Han Solo fits perfectly in between Episode 3 'Revenge of the Sith' and the first Star Wars anthology film 'Rogue One'. The story also features original trilogy co-protagonists Chewbacca and Lando Calrissian. The start of the film is extremely fast-paced and situated on the eerie planet of Corellia. Orphans Han and Qi'ra attempt to leave the planet and escape from they local gang, where previously they had been held hostage. Han's driving skills are second to none and despite being chased, the pair make it into the transport centre and bribe an Imperial officer with stolen fuel, known as coaxium, for passage on an outgoing transport. However, Qi'ra, played by Emilia Clarke, is captured before she can join Han on board, separating the pair desperately. Han promises to return for her and joins the Imperial Navy as a flight cadet, being giving the name 'Solo' for having no other reason than being alone. The presentation of Solo is a confident man who is also slightly immature for his age, not to mention his harsh sense of humour that we see throughout the film. The character is performed by Alden Ehrenreich and stated by the actor himself, Han is more of an ""idealist"" in Solo. The three year transition pictures Han serving as an infantryman in a war zone after being expelled from the Imperial Flight Academy after insubordination. He comes across a group of criminals posing as Imperial soldiers led by Tobias Beckett. Han attempts to blackmail Beckett and escape life from the war zone, but Beckett has him arrested and thrown into a pit to be fed to a wookie prisoner named Chewbacca. Convenient that Han is able to speak Chewbacca's language, he cooperates with the Wookie and persuades him to help and escape together, the pair exist the pit and try to signal Beckett on an outgoing ship, Tobias is aware of Chewbacca's strength and orders the two to join them on a mission. Enlisting them in the gang to steal a shipment of coaxium on Vandor-1. The plan is hijacked by the intruding Cloud Riders (Pirates) led by Enfys Nest, resulting in the deaths of Beckett's wife Val and the ship's pilot, allowing hand to step in and steer the ship, the mission resulted in the destruction of the coaxium. Beckett, who is played expertly by Woody Harrelson, reveals he was ordered to steal the shipment for Dryden Vos, a high-ranking crime boss in the Crimson Dawn syndicate. Tobias Beckett is portrayed as a rebellious leader, who aims to master his work to perfection; and is under pressure to provide for Dryden, Han and Chewbacca volunteer to steal another shipment to repay the debt. They head to Vos's yacht where Han spots Qi'ra, who is Dryden's top lieutenant at Crimson Dawn. Han is ecstatic to see her but the joy isn't necessarily reciprocated, with Emilia Clarke's character overwhelmed by seeing her former friend takes a reserved approach to the situation. She leads them to Lando Calrissian, a slick, humerus smuggler and pilot who she hopes will lend them his ship, the Millennium Falcon. Han challenges Lando to a game of Sabacc with the wager being Lando's ship. However, Lando cheats to win but agrees to join the mission in exchange for a share of the profits. The group along with Lando reach Kessel in the Falcon and infiltrate the mine. Lando's peculiar droid and co-pilot L3-37 investigates a slave revolt. In the confusion they steal the coaxium but in the process L3 sustains a damaging injury and Lando is wounded in the escape. L3's navigational computer hot-wired into the ships system, allows Han to pilot the ship through the dangerous and uncharted Kessel run to elude an imperial blockade. The Falcon, much to Lando's disappointment, is badly damaged and lands on the planet Savareen to process the coaxium. Having tracked the team from Vandor, Enfys arrives while Lando leaves in the Falcon, deserting everyone else. Enfys reveals that she and her pirate crew are rebels trying to strike back at the syndicates and the Empire. The Cloud Riders come across as a group of people hoping to bring peace to the Galaxy, and put themselves on the line to make a statement against the Empire, there bravery is liked by Han and he grows to be sympathetic toward the group. Solo tries to trick Dryden, who states that Beckett has already alerted him to the double-cross. Vos sends his guards to kill Enfys but the pirates over power their opponents, leaving Vos defenceless. Having anticipated Vos's strategy, Han tries to take the coaxium, but Beckett betrays Dryden and escapes with it, taking Chewbacca hostage. Qi'ra is situated in Vos's head office with Han who appears helpless, but, Qi'ra shapes to kill Han, before turning and shooting Dryden, encouraging Han to go after Beckett. Qi'ra takes Vos's ring and asserts her authority on the room, replacing Dryden as boss and receiving the sense of dominance. She contacts Vos's superior, the former Sith Lord Maul, to inform to him of the missions failure, which she blames on Beckett. Maul orders Qi'ra to meet with him on Dathomir, where they will discuss what to do with Beckett and his associates - he then states that him and her will be working very closely in the future. Qi'ra in the beginning, appeared a grateful friend to Han, and trusted him dearly. Her separation from him and experience on Corellia fuel a dark sense inside of her, making her easily seduced by the Dark side, her want for power overrules her want for love and goes rogue as boss of the syndicate alone, ironic due to the name of her old friend. Han follows Qi'ra's command and confronts Beckett, shooting him before he can return fire. As Qi'ra leaves in Vos's yacht, Tobias warns Han that it was never about him and rather about her own personal gain, he then dies. Han and Chewy give the coaxium to Enfys who is extremely grateful and offers Han the choice to join the rebellion against the Empire. Han, who sticks by his surname, declines and receives a vial of coaxium, enough to purchase a ship of his own. Solo and Chewbacca locate Lando and challenge the smuggler to another game of sabacc, once again wagering the Falcon. Han wins, having stolen the card retriever Lando used in order to cheat; he and Chewbacca leave in the prestigious Millennium Falcon and head to Tatooine to find a crime lord who is putting together a profitable job. The story answering any unanswered questions from the saga in a fitting ending: Chewbacca and Han Solo flying in the famous Millennium Falcon. A very well directed film experiences the life difficulties that Solo had experienced in the past, suggesting why he is perhaps informal in his speech. Despite Han not achieving his initial aim, which was to come back, rescue Qi'ra and live happily ever after in safety and comfort. The two did meet again in unprecedented terms. Their rejoining somewhat coincidental but fitted perfectly in the story of gaining the coaxium shipment, for Crimson Dawn. Solo appeared pleased that Qi'ra escaped life on Corellia and moved into a similar profession to he. Yet we are surprised by Qi'ra's interaction with Maul, it explains why she was conservative when seeing the protagonist. The screenplay creates the start of a new prestigious partnership: The pilot and the Wookie, a pairing that continues throughout the saga, seeing how the two met, and how their adventure began.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
339,risbyceonna,Fun but a little off,7,26 June 2021,"The main problem with this movie is the pacing and characters. First, we get introduced to 3 new characters then 2 of them just die off in the first 20 minutes and the movie expects us to care about them. We didn't even get a chance to know these characters, the writers should've just left them out. Then the characters didn't even grieve over them, they're just like ""oh well"". Then we get introduced to Lando just for him to leave in the first hour, the writers obviously don't know how to introduce characters and develop them. Han feels like a rip off Peter Quill. Then we find out Beckett was the villain the whole time then he dies. Beckett tells Han that he cannot trust anyone then why go through the trouble of having a relationship with the girl that died off? Why let Han on your ship? Him becoming a villain seems off. Everything is a bit confusing and fast paced. Then at the end Lando and Han are suddenly friends when Lando literally stated that he didn't want to see Han again. The movie is fun to watch if you don't think about it too much. 7/10 it's decent.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
340,JTurner82,"Probably my least favorite Disney-made STAR WARS, but still better than both the prequels and than it has any right to be.",7,31 July 2018,"Disney's purchase of the STAR WARS brand was something I never dreamed I would live to see. Considering the uneven and lackluster nature of the prequels (particularly ATTACK OF THE CLONES and THE PHANTOM MENACE -- REVENGE OF THE SITH being the only saving grace, albeit flawed, too), I wasn't sure if their inevitable sequel trilogy would be any better. Happily, for the most part, it was. THE FORCE AWAKENS may have been a callback to A NEW HOPE, and THE LAST JEDI, for better or worse, was a daring, controversial turning point, but I found both films to be far more compelling than Episodes I & II of the franchise. In between, Disney has also provided us with an ""anthology film"", ROGUE ONE, which was quite good all around. Now along comes yet another ""anthology film"" for STAR WARS, this time focusing on the series' most famous scoundrel, Han Solo. This one had a much more rocky road to completion -- apparently the original directors assigned to the project were fired, and a new one, none other than Ron Howard (director of the much underrated fantasy WILLOW -- still one of my favorite movies), was brought in to reshoot scenes. Based on this production nightmare, one would assume that SOLO: A STAR WARS STORY could very well be a disaster. Thankfully, it isn't. Simultaneously, though, of the new STAR WARS movies, SOLO is probably my least favorite of the four so far.Don't get me wrong, SOLO is not a bad movie at all. It is competently made, well cast, and moves along well for the most part. But compared to what I may argue would be its more ambitious and even daring predecessors, SOLO seems a little too ""safe"". The stakes in this tale aren't as high -- it's basically about a younger Solo, and so there aren't going to be any major casualties like there were in the previous entries. Consequently, it also lacks the ""must-see"" factor that was there even for the prequels. Perhaps the worst I can say about it is that it's a bit more forgettable. Other than a few standout action sequences and great performances, I'm hard pressed to remember a lot about SOLO.That said, does SOLO: A STAR WARS STORY still have its points of interest? Absolutely. Alden Ehrenreich had a very daunting task stepping into the shoes of an iconic character made famous by Harrison Ford. He was never going to be able to top the actor no matter what. But having said that, he still does a very respectable job at making Solo a charismatic, swaggering badass. Part of it might be because he is in the hands of a director who understands the importance of gaining cast chemistry. Either way, his turn as Solo is far more engaging than Hayden Christensen's Anakin in the prequels any day. That said, the real star of the show is Donald Glover as Lando Calrissian. Arguably an even better match for what Billy Dee Williams created in THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK and RETURN OF THE JEDI than Alden would have been for Han, Glover fits seamlessly into the role like a glove, and is charming from the start. Every second of his performance is a delight. Oddly, my favorite performance in the film might be that of Chewbacca. Don't get me wrong, the performances are well done in general, but there was something about Chewie in this movie that I found really appealing, and for some reason he stands out here.The two sequences that also stand out in the film include a thrilling train chase which must have been inspired by Hayao Miyazaki's CASTLE IN THE SKY. Well staged and timed, this ranks among the most exciting in any STAR WARS action sequence. Just as good is later on in the film when Han steers the Falcon into a nebulous space cloud, dodging TIE fighters at breakneck speed, and outrunning a massive space octopus-sort of creature that threatens to consume the ship. Both of these are worth the price of admission.So why three and a half stars out of five? The main reason is because I didn't really find a lot of the new characters all that remarkable or interesting. It's not the fault of Woody Harrelson, Emilia Clarke, Thandie Newton, or Paul Bettany -- they all breathe life to their roles, but none of them really stand out in any way. Perhaps a second viewing will change my thoughts, but I honestly didn't remember much about these new guys worth talking about. That and the storyline, although interesting, does drag at times, particularly the last act. Still, the script by Lawrence Kasdan does contain enough barb and wit from the characters to provide a humorous tone for what are mostly one-note roles. Musically, too, the score is lacking compared to what we've heard from John Williams -- it's not John Powell's fault, he does the best he can, but I'm hard-pressed to remember a cue.Don't take any of these complaints to suggest that I dislike SOLO: A STAR WARS STORY. Despite its faults, it's still a competently executed entry and is worth viewing at least once. Simultaneously, though, it's not one that I'm so eager to see again on the big screen, partially because it doesn't really do anything that we didn't already see. All in all, SOLO is good, but not great -- all things considered, it's better than it has any right to be, but it's not really a ""must-see"". At least it beats Episodes I & II.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

*Emilia Clarke and Alden's chemistry is everything!
*No lightsabers but I LOVE their space journey/ battle!!! Hyperspeed! 
*You Clone Wars fans are gonna love it 
*Funnest SW film since ANH, it's light!!!! And I love it. Less drama. Something we all need at the moment.
* I LOVE ALL THE CHARACTERS EVEN THE VILLAINS. Beckett!! Paul Bettany, is really my boi. I'm SO happy I didn't listen to whatever bad reviews the critics were saying. I almost missed this one out on the cinema but I'm really glad that I didn't because I enjoyed the movie a lot!!!!!!
If you are a Star Wars fan, go see it. You won't regret it. HAN SOLO DESERVES ALL THE LOVE!!!! Keeping my ticket for memory. Super super enjoyable  There's a moment where Alden Ehrenreich does that signature big wide, cocky smile and I wanted to jump into the screen and hug him. He really did a great job portraying Han with some of his own identity while still managing to bring that Harrison Ford-Esque charm :) so yeah, I think everyone owes a huge apology. Not only was the film fantastic, he did great service to the character of Han Solo.P.S.- It wasn't not great, not bad either... but I promised you it's GOOOOD.

342,e-70733,Just OK,6,27 May 2018,"The lack of drama in the action scenes is probably the most prominent problem in this film. Tribute and remembrance to the previous works are not really integrated into the story itself.

343,BiiivAL,Solo episode,7,2 June 2018,"On the new opus of the mouse house in the Star Wars universe I loved since childhood, I did not go immediately. I did not read the reviews, but I heard about the fact that the studio bosses are not very satisfied with the cashier of the film, because Salon solo expectations (sorry for the pun) were not justified.Personally, I liked it, but there are reservations.The plot is clear and digestible. There are no illogicalities and strange twists. Pianos, too, really one moment in the end (more precisely the appearance) of me (yes, I think most) surprised. Hint on the continuation of the story prequel Solo? Well I do not know. There is a problem with the arches of the heroes, especially with the line of the protagonist - he shows us from the middle point. There was no need to remove it from the young nails, but there was a lack of disclosure.It is important to note that in contrast to the serious ""Outcast"", humor appeared here. Relevant and adequate. To become a protagonist. And there are no excesses.Howard promised us fantasy with a touch of a criminal film. And this promise was kept. Even overfulfilled! In the film, there are notes of a western - robbery, chases, dashing guys. Not to mention some of the mise-en-scenes characteristic of the genre. And this greatly pleased me.In addition to westerns, there are a lot of Easter eggs for other films - I personally saw the ""Army of the Dead"" and ""The Empire Strikes Back."" With fanservisom managed to cheer.That did not work with Khan. It is clear that the second Harison Ford can be obtained only by cloning, and then there are no guarantees. But somehow Alden does not stretch. Too so cute, and charisma is not enough. So harrowing young Solo, and not a brave captain-smuggler Solo. Eh. But Harelson and Bethany pleased so pleased. Suppose that the second does not have much screen time, but he used them in full. It's a pity that other directors, unlike Howard, do not notice him. Clarke. c. a. the Dragon Mammon? Yes, as always, no! I actually do not understand why she was loved in the Thrones? Quasi is cute, a doll with a doll and a game of eyebrows. Not ice.In the end, we got a good movie no worse, but not better than ""Outcast"". It turned out to be a kind of western in the network of Star Wars with good humor, but with a bad actor in the title role and strange story arches.It's strange and not clear - what rejected the audience? Disappointment with the 8th episode and the mouse house?I want to believe that the universe has potential!

Don't listen to the people saying the movie failed because of it being released too close to The Last Jedi. And don't listen to the people who blame The Last Jedi for the underperformance of this movie. It is not true.And if you did listen to them, then you missed out on an amazing movie. It was beyond what I was expecting it to be and I have been a Star Wars fan for 33 years.The movie was brilliantly cast. Alden plays the perfect Han Solo. He has the charm and the wit like what Harrison had for the character. Donald Glover is amazing as Lando and hearing him speak is like listening to Billy Dee Williams. And Woody was fantastic as Beckett as well. And Emilia was wonderful as Qi'ra.The movies storyline is like a typical heist robbery film. And it makes perfect sense for the characters in the movie. It had plenty of action, humour and a surprise reveal at the end which made us fan boys get all excited.It is truly sad that this film didn't get the much deserved praise it should have received. Ron Howard did an amazing job cleaning up the mess left over by the two former directors after they were fired.Like Rogue One, I think this film is superior to The Force Awakens and The Last Jedi in many ways. It brought back a sense of adventure in the Star Wars movies again.At the moment it is unlikely we will get a sequel to this.

348,villard,Soooo-Low,1,1 October 2018,"Just when you thought it couldn't get any worse, we have the saddest example yet of the Disney empire vampire sucking all the electrifying fun out of the Star Wars mythology. This insipid film is the antithesis of everything the original Star Wars was: lacking any edge-of-seat excitement, action, adventure, breathtaking pace, or clever humor. It's like comparing a roller coaster ride to a stroll down a hiking path. Even an accomplished director like Ron Howard could not save a lackluster and convoluted screenplay, and lethargic, forgettable cast. Much worse than the bland story is the terribly miscast Alden Ehrenreich as a 20-something Han Solo. (Remember, the Harrison Ford version of the character first appeared in his mid-30s.) It seems to me that Ehrenreich was too lazy, or conceited, or simply lacked the talent to have taken time to study and emulate the Solo character that Ford develop with his wry wit, wise-guy smirk, and charming playfulness. It seems like Ehrenreich settled for just playing himself. He's as miscast as if Cher was asked to play Lucille Ball. The only redeeming character is the feminist robot, L3-37, who has the only fun lines in the entire 135 minutes of mediocrity. Is this really the best formula the Disney folks can come up with? Taking an uninspiring story, slapping Star Wars names onto the characters, and wrapping it in tons of special effects eye-candy.

Not so.Actually, this was a pretty good addition to the Star Wars canon, definitely better (and hugely less derivative) than J.J. Abrams episode VII feature, ""The Force Awakens."" You get a nice little ""meet-cute"" for Han and Chewbacca, some retcons for how he got the name ""Solo' and his first dealings with Lando, and even how he ended up with the Millenium Falcon and ""made the Kessel run in 12 parsecs"" (turns out that DOES make sense. Who knew?) Considering the title role was given to Alden Ehrenreich, an actor with NO discernible on-screen charisma, the whole thing turns out pretty well. I think it's probably a mistake to introduce a continuing plot rather than neatly tying off the storylines at the end (as was done in the superior ""Rogue One"") but that's probably inevitable these days, given the financial success of SW's Disney stablemate Marvel universe with its interlinked movies. However, the ploy of a ridiculous cameo near the end (one that doesn't make any damn sense until you investigate plotlines from the friggin CARTOONS) was a complete misstep.Even so, I'd recommend this film, at least for those with a familiarity with the original films.

After 10 minutes I was exhausted and wanted to leave. In many ways it reminded me of a Transformer movie - and that is not a compliment. I take that back - Michael Bay is more restrained than this director.And who decided to give this franchise to Ron Howard? What has he done in the last THREE DECADES that has been any good? This is a man who takes no chances and gives us pedestrian boring films. No surprise, then, that he gave us another one.There is no real villain in this film, either. How can you have a sci-fi film for over 2 hours without any villains?And what was up with the literally 12 second cameo with Warwick Davis?

354,heatsink98,Needed a serious rewrite,4,25 May 2018,"Han Solo finally gets his backstory, and it's sadly boring. I'm not sure if this is related to the change of directors midstream, or if the script was always in need of a rewrite. Since this film is basically one large flashback, it requires something to keep us interested since there's no danger to Han, Chewie, or any of the main characters we already know about. SOLO is lacking in this aspect. Note that WONDERWOMAN was in the same boat, and the writers there wisely chose to use that simple photograph from WW I to open the story and raise a question about what was going on.Things start off in this movie well enough. We see Han in his formative years on Corellia, and then he's off on a quest to rack up some serious dough. Things spiral out of control plot-wise after that. Han's main goal is soon solved by random coincidence. Then he's off on more tasks to dig himself out of trouble. All the while, a major plotline with an important character is running in the background, but it's completely undeveloped. Toward the end of the movie, we finally learn what's going on, but it leaves the film feeling hollow because all this important information was withheld from the audience. The movie drags on for quite a bit until everything wraps up, but it's hard to stay interested.On the character side of things, Alden Ehrenreich does a decent enough job channeling young Harrison Ford, and Donald Glover has Billy Dee Williams's speech pattern down pat. Emilia Clarke's character, Qi'ra, was a little off, though, because she seemed like a giggly schoolgirl who was strangely agreeable. For a girl coming up in the sewers of Corellia, her character traits seemed like a mismatch for her environment.Altogether, this was a hard movie to stay interested in, even in the fantastic Star Wars universe. Ticket sales will likely be fine due to the franchise strength, even with the damage Rian Johnson did in the previous movie.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
355,photoe,"Not perfect, but worth the time",7,14 April 2019,"Solo is better than I expected, or than anyone expected from all the awful kvetching this movie received ahead of time, plus the kvetching around Last Jedi. Star Wars has turned into a giant bellyaching exercise for fans and detractors alike.Ron Howard clearly saved the movie, and made it a cogent adventure. That said, there are issues: Donald Glover has zero muscle or gravitas to him. I couldn't believe he was anything but the entitled, born-into-fame playboy that he is in real life. He didn't even really stay in character well. I watched his performance closer the second time through, and saw a lot more errors.Emilia Clarke is also not credible. Her acting seems to consist of acting royal, and it becomes a royal bore. I didn't buy her as this super manipulative likely villain, nor as desireable object of affection, but she was better than Glover. It feels like she's essentially standing in from Game of Thrones, just getting this role because she is hot at the moment. It didn't feel like her heart and soul was in this. It seemed really phoned in, and you don't do that in a Star Wars movie.Woody Harrelson is overexposed and in too many movies, and I didn't need him here. He was also not consistent in his characterizations, but that could be the original director's fault.The real surprise, and the movie's saving grace is Ehrenreich, who someone manages to jump into the shoes of the most beloved and handsome scoundrel in sci-fi history, and actually pull it off, more or less. His is a younger more naive Solo, but that's what you want really. He isn't grating, and he has some credibility, so it works. Thank God they didn't put Glover in the role. As an actor, he's essentially a hack.The plot was reasonable, however, and the action was brisk and suspenseful.

After a while, I figured it was just easier to keep track of anything 'Solo' happened to do well, and in the end there wasn't a whole lot to remember.I understand why Disney wants the Star Wars franchise to take on a darker, grittier tone. Just look at how well that worked out for Nolan's Batman franchise. But just making a film's visual aesthetic literally dark--or perhaps a better adjective in this case would be drab--does not somehow automatically make it gritty. I'll also never understand why nobody involved with the film insisted that Alden Ehrenreich, a talented actor who plays a young Han Solo, take on any of Harrison Ford's signature affectations. Compare this to Donald Glover, who is instantly recognizable as a young Lando Calrissian, and the decision becomes even more maddening.

358,slicedbread117,An Impossible Prequel That Flirts With Mediocrity,7,6 July 2018,"Was it really ever even asked for? Well, regardless of whether a prequel story featuring the galaxy's greatest flyboy was needed, or wanted, it's here to stay. ""Rogue One"" was enough spark to give Disney the confidence to shout full steam ahead on the spin-off anthology films (rightfully so), and what we got was Solo: A Star Wars Story; a gamble that provides some excellent and varied entertainment, while simultaneously giving a possible killing blow to the spin-off films before they could even get going.First, the elephant in the room. Harrison Ford is Han Solo. His iconic portrayal lingers so large in the hearts of Star Wars fans that it subsequently gives our new Han Solo, Alden Ehrenreich, the impossible task of living up to Ford's legacy. This presented questions and concerns before the release of the film with the reports of an acting coach on set and presents more during the film. Granted, Disney and Lucasfilm stated that this was not intended to be a direct impersonation of Ford's performance, but as good as Ehrenreich can be in his own skin (which is pretty good), he's no Ford. Sure, this performance should be linked to the fact that this a younger, less scheming Han, not yet bold enough to shoot first, a fantastic means to view and understand the character. Yet the constant comparison and thoughts of ""is this an accurate development into what we see in 'A New Hope'?"" gives an unwanted distraction throughout the entire movie, instead of taking Ehrenreich's talents to perhaps create a new Han-like character in the franchise.Ehrenreich for the most part is decent; witty, charming, and fair when it comes to displaying his emotions, he did his best in a nearly impossible role. But there it is again, an impossible role. I felt like I was cheating on my own thoughts by thinking of how he connected to Ford's version almost the whole film. Not only isn't that fair to Ehrenreich as viewers judge him, it's not fair to Star Wars fans who now have a dual-personality vision of one of the greatest Star Wars characters ever. This role couldn't have been done absolute justice, a role that probably shouldn't have existed in the first place.Here's where more mixed elements come into the equation; what we (as fans, largely, I think) really wanted or needed to see be introduced with Han, and some of the elements we did see. How Han met Chewbacca? Great. How Han wins the Millennium Flacon? Pretty fun. How he got his blaster? Good enough. But how Han got his last name? Why Lando dresses the way he does? The mythical Kessel Run? Solo doesn't always seem to be able to justify why the film needs to exist. For Han, it's simply difficult to put his character into prequel status in a mainline feature film. That's not to say Han's story isn't compelling, because it is, yet I struggled to accept many aspects as official canon. Solo tries too hard to thread the needle between this film and the same characters we know in the original trilogy and that's like eating Juicy Fruit gum; great at first, but the more you sit with it, the worse it becomes. I titled my ""Rogue One"" review ""The Prequel Star Wars Never Knew It Needed"". Solo is more the prequel Star Wars never really needed.For the main course, the story. For the most part, it's awesome. Lawrence Kasdan and his son Jonathan's magic Star Wars pens deliver a fun, energetic and amusing script. It's simple but grounded, boasting fun twists, even if they become somewhat predictable. What works best for Solo is that this is a side of Star Wars we haven't seen enough of. While the main episodic films focus on the Force, light side and dark side alike, there's an entire galaxy of unique stories to be explored and Solo gets me on board for more of it. There's a sweet western-in-space vibe with hints of gangster and heist film sprinkled around, and straight big budget Star Wars action on top. Fast-paced chase scenes, conniving plots and one of the best darn action sequences in recent Star Wars memory set to the tune of a train heist in space, Solo tries to do it all. The humor is clever and witty, not as as mistimed such as in ""The Last Jedi"". Kasdan's dialogue is solidly written enough to give proper spunk to the story. I can't say John Powell's score was too great, it was a safe ensemble of music that compliments the story well enough, but only really stands out when we get a taste of John Williams' pieces mixed in. Director Ron Howard really gets his vision across into a condensed, fairly well paced film (there are some hiccups), when it could've ended up like Justice League, a horrendous product of two directors (following the Lord and Miller fiasco). I'll admit, this story undoubtedly would've fit much better with all original characters with small main episode appearances here and there. The stakes can be undersold because, no matter how hard Solo tries to throw us curveballs, we know darn well Chewie isn't going to die on that train. Solo's label as an ""origin"" story kept me somewhat less invested in the story, yet Howard still pulls together a swash-buckling space adventure which works just well enough. Where the development and performance of Han might fall a little short, (although the dynamic between Han and Chewie is beautifully reminiscent of '77-'83 captain and Wookie), Donald Glover's Lando Calrissian more than makes up for it. Glover is wildly charismatic, heartwarmingly funny and charming, and in my opinion, is the best recreation of a previous character since Ewen McGregor solidified himself as this generation's Obi-Wan Kenobi. And how about that Darth Maul cameo? That was a delicious surprise that not only gave fans of the TV shows a nod of recognition, but it made sense in the story being told, not just a random cameo for cameo sake. Solo fills itself with some memorable, and not so memorable original characters. We get great new additions like Woody Harrelson's calculating space-pirate Beckett, who's twisting and turning provide great changeups, and Paul Bettany's interestingly tense villain Dryden Vos. Outside of that, everyone else is pretty bland. The reveal of the marauders and their leader, Enfys Nest, was totally underwhelming and Beckett's original team provided zero depth. Emilia Clarke as Qi'ra, the love interest if you will, had an interesting character arc in relation to Han, but was ultimately a letdown, not as emotionally impactful as she could've been. Falling in the middle would be the next new droid, L3-37. The character is voiced wonderfully by Phoebe Waller-Bridge, bringing with it a humor and complexity not yet seen from a droid in Star Wars. However, I couldn't help but feel as though the more political dialogue and mindset from L3-37 didn't fit as well inside of Star Wars, it throws a wrench in the film's tone often.No, it probably wasn't ever needed or asked for. Solo proves definitively that Harrison Ford's legacy shouldn't be messed with or touched. No matter how well Alden Ehrenreich performs, it truly was an impractical role. It proves that not every character needs a detailed backstory shown in film, that leaving story to the imagination sometimes works better. It proves that this type of story can absolutely work inside of the franchise, but the Han Solo origin was the wrong context for it. It dabbles with being mediocre, but Solo still is able to find a way to use clever dialogue, a unique setting and that classic Star Wars feeling to deliver an overall fun adventure in a galaxy far far away.7.5/10",Solo - A Star Wars Story
359,Lost_In_Translation_,Marred by forced fan service and a middling script,5,14 April 2019,"So far these ""Star Wars Stories"" have gone from my most anticipated movies, to some of the worst Star Wars media ever made.Rogue One was such a letdown. The set-up was fantastic and exciting, but the poorly crafted characters and sub par action made it such a bummer watching wasted potential. I didn't give a crap about any of those characters as they were so poorly written and their stories were so shoddily set up.Going into Solo I was weary after Rogue One was such a mess. Expectations were already low and just lowered with the removal of Miller and Lord from the directing chairs. They crafted the brilliant Lego Movie among other works and I was supremely let down when Kathleen Kennedy fired them because they weren't going with ""her"" vision of what the movie should be.So with all that drama going on it was pretty much impossible that this movie would be remotely good at all. It's not all terrible, but it should have been so much better.The main pros of it are the cast for sure. Everyone is great in it, despite their characters not being that well realized. The cinematography is pretty stellar as well. They made it look and feel like old Star Wars.Now the cons are too many for me to divulge here fully, but here's just a few. The big ""heist"" of the movie was barely a heist. More like them just landing, shooting their way in, shooting their way out and that was all. It should have been an Ocean's 11-esque set up and execution of a heist with improvisation when bits go wrong. But nope, it was just a boring scene with Han struggling to push the heavy loot out while the dumb robot caused a robot uprising in the mine. And yes, a big con is the extra annoying robot of Lando's.Also the fact that pretty much EVERY character trait we know from Han in the previous movies ALL happened to him during this short time with this crew? He gets his last name (dumb), gets his blaster, learns to ""shoot first""(extra dumb), he gets Chewie (dumb), completes the Kessel Run AND gets the Falcon ALL within the timeframe of his life?? All of that just felt too tacked on and them hardcore attempting to service the fans. Now the earning his last name is before all of this stuff but he LITERALLY meets Chewie, gets the DL44, gets the Falcon, ""shoots first"", and completes the Kessel Run all within this short frame of time. It's like they just NEEDED to cram everything we know about Han into this short period of time so they could show it in the movie.Besides all of those nitpicky aspects about Han's past, the movie overall just isn't that interesting. The only good action scene is the train heist, which is a better heist than the main friggin one of the movie! The rest of the action is serviceable. But just the story the chose to tell with Han and his past with Qi'ra were so poorly written and the story they tell just to show us EVERY character aspect of Han just really made this movie a stinker.It's probably good that they're taking a break from the side stories. The main saga movies have all been great and Rise of Skywalker looks like a fantastic finale. I'm still a big fan of the universe, so I will watch anything else they release, but it's hard to get excited for the series when every other movie besides the main saga are so poorly made and just a bummer to watch.Even though Rogue One failed, at least it was trying something unique. They really need to focus on characters other than the ones that we already have a special place in our hearts for.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
360,Ingrouille181,"An average feeling throughout, for a Han Solo movie?",5,24 May 2018,"I went into Solo, A Star Wars story with really no expectations. Disney have handled the Star Wars Saga pretty poorly to say the least (well maybe except for Rogue One, I like that more than most). Production was a mess, Kennedy didn't see the money train rolling with enough cargo so she fired the directors Christopher Miller and Phil Lord and hired Ron Howard to take the reigns, and here we have this, a Star Wars movie that's run of the mill. A run of the mill Star Wars movie.Story focuses on a young Han Solo, and his early days of smugglings, meeting Chewbacca, Lando and others as they go and smuggle stuff for some bad guys. Want a proper synopsis, go to Wikipedia; they'll surely give us a more angelic one than I can. This movie was wasted potential. I can understand this is a film about the early life of Han Solo; there's no lightsabers, or the force, so all we have to work off of is the Galactic Empire and character recognition. The majority of new characters brought in either die, or just didn't bring any sort of impact I wanted. The film is mainly concerned with ""nostalgia"" and ""meta"" things to carry it.Alden Ehrenreich was cool as Solo, and that's it cool. He didn't really embody Han Solo; you can make the argument that his persona would grow from what it is, and sure, we don't need him to be doing a beat-for-beat Han impression, but I need something, anything to make me think this guy will become the swash-buckling smuggler scoundrel he is in A New Hope. Chewbacca was good; not much you can do with Chewie really. I always had this idea of what Han and Chewie's first encounter would be like in my head, but I still enjoyed how they met in this movie.As for all the other character: sheesh! First, Emilia Clarke as ""Qi'ra"" could not care about her at all. I enjoy the bait and switch with the damsel in distress trope being thrown out, well kinda, but I've already seen that in other movies so.... not to mention her last scene didn't make me the least bit interested to see her in another movie. A wasted character, with a bland name and persona.If there's one thing I loved most it was the relationship between Han and Lando. Donald Glover makes a PERFECT young Lando, and even though Ehrenreich just didn't come off like Han at all, I believed that their encounters would lead into their meeting in The Empire Strikes Back. Lando just comes off as so suave and charming, definitely what would become older Lando in Empire. I also enjoyed Paul Bettany's character Dryden Vos, the Jabba the Hut of the movie. He definitely came off as intimidating, and the believable type. Whenever he was on screen I was getting flashbacks to Hans Landa at the beginning of Inglorious Bastards.Woody Harrelson's character was decent, did his job well even though he could have been written a little better and had a better pay off. And this is really a pet peeve of mine with Star Wars lore, but his characters name, ""Tobias Beckett"", really? What did Howard finally get to use one of his rejected names from In the Heart of the Sea? Be a little creative next time Lucasfilm. Or is this Disney and Lucasfilm finally giving creative control over because they're desperate for money?Overall, it was a production nightmare, certain plots were rushed to keep up with the runtime, which only hurt the pacing. The majority of characters I didn't care about, and the plot line was cliche, especially for a Star Wars. Disney can do better than this, Lucasfilm can do better than this. Kennedy should have known better.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

363,graves-scott,How do you manage to score a movie a 2 and a 9 at the same time?,6,20 January 2019,"Ok, as a Star Wars CU (Cinematic Universe) Movie. A solid 2. Maybe a 3. It was a bit of a let down that spent too much effort showing how he got his toys and why the Falcon has that cut from the wedge that looks so damn cool. Then, because he's the coolest good guy ever, he has to overcome his selfishness and save the day for the plucky band of revolutionaries out to save the galaxy from the bad guys.See the problem? Like the rest of these stupid prequel movies that Hollywood seems obsessed by it suffers the same problems. It requires characters who made HUGE personal leaps from being self centered pricks looking out for number one to being the hero and redeeming themselves at the end of the original movie have to do it in the new movie so they follow that same heroic path that people can enjoy only to go back to being the scoundrel so it's believable in the original movie. Blech.Imagine someone 30 years from now watching these movies not in the original airing order but in actual timeline order. They'd give A New Hope a 2 or 3 at best for the fact that Han Solo, that wanna be outlaw with a heart of gold in Solo turned into a self centered dick in A New Hope only to have the EXACT SAME TRANSFORMATION again, like totes predictable man. Then in the next trilogy go on to be a self centered prick who has screwed over everyone in the galaxy he knows only to make, guess what, that SAME TRANSFORMATION in that movie...You'd think one massive dramatic change in personality would be enough for these guys but no, in Hollywood people back peddle all the time... make sense since the people in that crowd drop in and out of 12 step programs like they are summer camps.The absolute coolest thing about Han Solo, for those of who never watched A New Hope in the theaters for the very first time long before the character became a household name, was that Han was a huge self centered dick who bails on the Rebellion to save his own hide from the gangster but when hs buddy Luke is royally screwed, the Death Star is charging up, everyone on the planet is going to die and the bad guys are going to win in comes Han Solo! He blasts Vader into space, saves Luke, saves the Rebels, saves the Galaxy (until Empire Strikes Back) and a cheer that deafens you is heard from every person in the theater. That moment was when I became a Star Wars fan for life. But now Disney pisses all over that to make a buck and sell a bunch of new toys.Now, if we take it as a space based heist movie ether without a CMU or as the start of a CMU then it's a solid 8 and maybe a 9 if I'd never seen Firefly/Serenity. Really, seriously. I loved it. I enjoyed the story, the characters, the scenes, the effects, the interactions, the every damn thing. Except for the fact that they tired to explain that everything that makes Han Solo such an amazing guy happened to him in two weeks that started when he was invading another planet as a ground pounder with the Empire.Come on people. Stop raping our childhoods and move forward. What the hell is next, Solo an infants story? Solo, an Zygote's Story?Oh, the line where Solo has no flipping clue what Harelson's character is referring to while escaping the TIE Fighters... That was comedy gold.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
364,andrewnmiller,Solid fun,9,30 September 2019,"Briefly, before he sold Lucasfilm to Disney in 2012, Star Wars creator George Lucas began production on a film that would serve as the backstory to one of the series most beloved characters, the space renegade known as Han Solo. George also hired the screenwriter of the Empire Strikes Back Lawrence Kasden to write the film but Lawrence was committed to writing The Force Awakens and so passed the job of writing the film over to his son Jon until Lawrence would be available. However, it wasn't until 2015 that a Han Solo movie was being made. It was also announced that Phil Lord and Chris Miller, the same directors who made The Lego Movie and the Jump Street films, would be directing Solo. On the surface, it seemed a particularly odd choice to hire two directors who were known for comedy films to direct a Star Wars film as Lord and Miller had little to no skill directing any kind of sci-fi or action film of any kind but given their capabilities to integrate characters and sharp humor, to Lucasfilm and Kathleen Kennedy, it would seem that on paper, Phil and Chris could pull a movie like this off. When it came to casting the role of the young Han Solo, the final list of actors was shortened to about 12 with Miles Teller, Dave Franco and Scott Eastwood being considered, but in May of 2016, Alden Ehrenreich was cast to play the character which didn't sit well with a great deal of Star Wars fans as many wanted Anthony Ingruber to be cast as Han due to him looking almost identical to Harrison Ford. Once casting finished, the film began shooting in early 2017. Once Solo started filming, reports begin trickling in that many of Lucasfilm's executives were displeased with Ehrenreich's performance to the point that an acting coach to help Alden on the set and things were no better behind the scenes either. Tensions between Kennedy, Kasden and the directors began to show itself as nether side was on the same page when it came to the direction of the film. Kathleen wanted Solo to be more akin to Firefly while Lord and Miller wanted something akin to Ace Ventura not to mention Lucasfilm wasn't pleased with the duo's impromptu style and Kasden wasn't happy that his screenplay wasn't be filmed the way he thought it should. Phil and Chris were also refusing to bargain on the way they shot the scenes thus causing further treason between them and Lucasfilm. In the end, Kennedy wanted to avoid firing the directors so she first attempted to bolster and then replace the duo and so, in June of 2017, Kathleen reviled Lord and Miller as directors on Solo. Now, with reshoots being scheduled and the director's chair vacant, a new filmmaker would have to be brought in to save the film. That's when Lucasfilm would bring in director Ron Howard to finish the movie and given that Ron had directed the 1988 film Willow for Lucasfilm, it would seem he was just the man they needed to save Solo. Given the vast amount of reshoots needed, there was now not just a need to wrap the film up as quickly as possible but also productively and unlike Lord and Miller, Howard was expected to get the shots done fast with Howard reshooting 80 percent of Solo. In the end, Solo: A Star Wars Story was released on May 28th, 2018 and while the film got decent reviews from critics and fans alike, it utterly tanked at the box office.Now, my experience with Solo was interesting as given how high of a Star Wars fan I am, I wasn't thrilled in the slightest when the film was announced as I felt that a film about a young Han Solo was unnecessary and given how shrouded in mystery the character is, I was unconvinced that a movie could do him justice and even when Solo did come out, I didn't go see it. I only watched the movie recently in preparation for Star Wars Episode 9 and even though there were things I disliked about the film, I had a great time watching Solo. From its fast-paced action and musical score to its' acting, the film may not be The Empire Strikes Back or The Last Jedi in terms of storytelling but it's still fun as hell.The movie begins on the planet of Corellia where a young theft named Han Solo and his girlfriend Qi'ra flee from a local street gang and batter with an Imperial officer for passage out the planet but before the two can make their escape, Qi'ra is arrested. Han promises to come back for her and joins the Empire as a flight cadet. There years later, Han is discharged from the Imperial Navy for defiance and is serving as an Imperial infantryman on the planet Mimban. While there, he makes contact with a group of thieves led by Tobias Beckett. After Han attempts to extort the group, Beckett throws Solo into a pit to be fed to a Wookiee called Chewbacca. Able to speak the Wookiee language, Han gets Chewbacca to collaborate with him in escaping but Beckett rescues the two and recruits them for a heist to steal a space gas called coaxium on the planet Vandor. However, the heist goes array when another group of thieves called the Cloudriders show up and several of Beckett's group are killed as a result. Later on, Tobias confirms that he was hired to steal the coaxium by a crime boss named Dryden Vos. Han and Chewbacca offer to help Beckett steal another shipment of coaxuim in order to pay off the debt. Now, the three make recruit a new team and steal the coaxium for Vos while Han must learn the hard truth about the criminal life in the galaxy.The thing with Solo: A Star Wars Story is that it's just so wonderfully entertaining as a film and yet also how average it is at points. Now, calling the film that would be a disservice as in spite of Solo being the tenth Star Wars film to be released theatrically, it still feels like something rather fresh for any big film franchise as it's a big-screen jaunt that intentionally and clearly belittles everything that both Star Wars fans and the casual film viewer have come to expect from the Star Wars saga. Sure, there are a ton of routine elements from the other Star Wars films here but in a much more subtle way than some of the other films in the saga either as homages or clever nobs to the continuity of the Star Wars saga. Even without verifying that these references are in the movie, Solo still has less Jedi, Death Stars, or lightsabers than any of the other Star Wars films. As noted before, the production of Solo was a deeply troubled one and given that Ron Howard was brought in the save the film after Lord and Miller were fired, it's a miracle that Solo didn't turn into a Fran4sic level disaster as well as the scheduling confects the various actors, the complex logistics of the various sets and the budget of the film costing in the range of 275 to 300 million, this is no small-scale production. On paper, it would appear that Solo: A Star Wars Story has more in common with Justice League rather than The Last Jedi in terms of production troubles.Now, with all the production drama in mind, Ron Howard certainly deserves a lot more credit here as Solo could have turned out so much worse if another director was brought in to salvage the film. Ron is a structured and often underappreciated director who has a clear eye as well as a straightforward style of telling a story. Ron's films are modest and direct as he is a director who never gets in the way of whatever story he's telling unlike a director like Michael Cimino who was more focused on the details than the story at hand. This is something of an underrated honor in the filmmaker community and with the films that Howard has made, fostering a solid grip on the basics of telling a great story. The characters in Ron's films tend to have understandable arcs and real thoughts with very little getting lost in the mix as opposed to the characters in a Roland Emmerich or Zack Snyder film. Howard's direction is also humble which makes him perfect for a film like this in these kinds of situations.While watching Solo: A Star Wars Story, there's actually no sense of clashing tones or conflicting styles like what Justice League or Alita: Battle Angel had as there are moments in Solo where the actors are clearly more lively, their joking a bit more chatty and the witty beats a bit more clear. Nevertheless, Solo never seems to miss a beat by never veering off-course from the main story, taking any unnecessary turns or shifts into any pointless subplots. There's a bizarre feeling when you watch Solo that everything ends right there it's supposed to be with the bare minimum of bother. Unlike Fant4shit, there is absolutely nothing here that says that the film was a troubled production. Then again, nothing in Solo: A Star Wars Story says anything at all. In the hands of Ron Howard, Solo feels spotless and capable. It also feels secure in terms of its story especially when compared to the notably thought-provoking motivations of The Empire Strikes Back and The Last Jedi. Solo has nothing that would be seen as an offense to many a Star Wars fan's childhood memories, no story points or character arc that could be seen as a disservice or a breakdown of the core of the Star Wars saga. Surely, if the internet commentators weren't so violently opposed to Alden Ehrenreich playing the role of Han Solo, the film would have seemed to be an excellent refresher for those internet commentators who hated the Last Jedi and what it tried to do with the series. Solo is what it markets itself as, a fun space adventure. There is possibly something encouraging in that as given the movie's production issues and the aggressiveness of the internet commentators in the wake of The Last Jedi, it makes sense that Lucasfilm and Howard wanted to make a Star Wars film that would be more fun.Like many of the other Star Wars films, the plot of Solo is easy to follow as it forgoes a lot of the formalities of the Star Wars saga by building a class piece within the confines of the Star Wars universe. The film feels more like the Star Wars equivalent to The Great Train Robbery or The Magnificent Seven a",Solo - A Star Wars Story

Love the whole sequence of him trying to escape the planet with Kira at the beginning. One of my favorite scenes in Star Wars is when you see Han Solo fighting on the side of the Empire on MImban. Some of the best 7 minutes in Star Wars. The whole Kessel Run sequence is good just not my favorite. The 3rd act is unique with a shoot out in a small room. Love the twist with Enfys Nest that Han actually kinda started the Rebellion. Stand out characters include Han, Chewie, Lando, and Tobias Beckett. Love the whole Conveyex robbery scene.

366,Chiller7,It should have been Anthony Ingruber,10,5 June 2018,"Sorry to lead actor Alden Ehrenreich, he tried his best, but Disney made a mistake casting him. Watching the movie, I just never once found myself convinced that this guy was supposed to be the same person as Harrison Ford. I'm not even attacking his acting; it's just that no degree of acting skill can make up for having the wrong face and voice, not to mention height, for the role. People trying to be positive about the casting kept saying, ""He's just doing his own take on the role! We don't need an impersonator!"" But the big problem with that stance is that this is a prequel, not a reboot. We're supposed to be convinced that we're watching the same person as in the other movies. This isn't the right situation to be doing an original take on the character. Ewan McGregor, for instance, was a great Obi Wan because he mimicked Alec Guinness's voice and mannerisms perfectly and also looked like a younger version of the same guy. We just can't say the same about Alden Ehrenreich as Han Solo.That said, I'll give it 10 stars anyway, because it was mostly entertaining and that train scene was especially cool.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

369,k_g_barreto,Mediocre,7,11 September 2019,"Solo, the second Star Wars spin-off film, is mediocre, bland and presents a surprisingly lack of criativity, and in every Star Wars film, even in the movies that I don't like that much, like the two first ones in the prequels trilogy, is criative and innovative in some aspects. I didn't hate the film at all, it's enjoyable in some parts, and overall it's a watchable movie, and you can convice yourself that isn't so bad after a second or third viewing, the fact is, Solo tries to compact too many things in just one movie, like, in just one week, Solo meets Chewie, then meets Lando, then he does the Kessel run and then he obtains the Millenium Falcon, and all that important stuff that happened in his like happened in this singe two-hour movie. The movie would benefit if it was simpler. Could have just been the first encounter of Han and Chewie, and then develops their friendship and then Lando. There was no need for the Kessel Run scene, and I was expecting more, and in the end it was just ""meh"", unfortunely.There is good stuff in this movie as well. John Powell, the composer, is pretty good, and brings a enjoyable and maybe a memorable soundtrack. Loved the Enfys Nest theme, really cool and made her character more remarkable, with more 'presence' in screen. The visual effects here is just ok as well, I mean, I already watched thousands of modern blockbusters, maybe I just reached a point when I cannot get impressend by VFX anymore. The acting of all actors in this movie is mediocre as well, and I said ALL of them, no one stand out here, and that's a problem when you're talking about a Han Solo's movie. Alden E. it's not charismatic enough to be Han Solo, although he was good enough when performing Harrison's gestures and grimaces of Han's character. Donald Glover is just fine, but I liked Lando's character, wished to see more of him. I didn't care about Qi'Ra, Woody Harrelson's character and pretty much anyone else in this movie. Talking about Qi'Ra, the two ''twists'' present in the movie are predictable, at least the Beckett's one, although the cameo of Darth Maul was unexpected for me, Qi'Ra being loyal to Crimson Dawn was not a surprised and I already expected.Well, Solo was a waste of potential, or not, I was just okay without knowking how Han and Chewie met for the first time, how was the Kessel Run, and a lot of other stuff, it was not necessary, not at all. A better script, a better acting, well, a better ''everything'' is what that film needed to be at least decent, and what we got was just a mediocre spin-off about a great character, and he deserved something better and way more interesting, unfortunely, Han Solo didn't got what he deserved.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

371,jochemunlimited,Good enough,8,29 September 2018,"I am a huge fan of Star Wars. I read many books which were great stories. So I was very disappointed with the main story line of the Star Wars movies. I really do not like the new movies. But suddenly there was a good spin off and I have the same feeling about this movie.Does it at something to the story? Not really. Do we learn something new? Not really. Is it the same Star Wars like before. Not really. Are there abvious things happening? Yes. Is there some forced humour? Yes. I it somtimes cheesy? Yes. Does the story goes too fast sometimes? Yes. Are the heroes smarter and have more luck? Yes. Are there things to stretch the movie a bit? A little bit.But is it fun to watch? Yes. Is the acting good? Yes. Can I follow the story? Yes. Does it has good visuals? Yes. Are well trained soldiers suddenly idiots when they meet the heroes? I did not notice so much like in the other Star Wars movies. Did they do impossible things over and over again (like a hyperspace jump maneuver that is very dangerous, twice)? No. I mostly had the feeling it was the real Han Solo. It was not a: let's take a hansom guy who is really irritating and cannot act. I think it fits him perfectly. I had to get used to Emilia Clarke. The acting was good but I do not know, I am not completely convinced.So I am just trying to forget what I know about Star Wars and start watching the movie. And you know what? I was suddenly sitting on the tip of my chair, sucked into the movie. It was entertaining and for me it was a solid movie. Why not make a show about Han? Like on Netflix. I think you can make many episodes. Just like Star Wars Rebels, but not a cartoon ;).",Solo - A Star Wars Story

While a good movie, once you are finished watching it, you will wonder whether or not the film should have even been made as it doesn't really add to the star wars mythos in any grand way or add too much to its various characters' stories. But aside from that, I think star wars fans will have an absolute treat on their hands with this with wonderful acting and a good story that seeks to explore the black market of the star wars universe and something that for the most part you wont regret watching.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
375,phoenixyk1,A Totally Unnecessary Addition to the Mythos - But worth a watch!,6,8 June 2019,"Let's start by being very honest - When this film was announced, I was NOT ON BOARD! Half of teh fun of Han Solo in Star Wars for me has always been his 'Typical Western Outlaw in Space' Gimmick - Where you do not know his past... Where he is a Mystery and could be ANYTHING you wanted him to be, there is a reason there has never been a Prequel to The Good, The Bad and The Ugly - Looking at Clint Eastwood before he became the Spaghetti Western Outlaw that so many love, There is a reason that we never see John Wayne Prequel Movies... And I felt the same should be true here.Then the Review Bombs and Critical YouTube Videos started to drop over SJW Agendas... Personally, I didn't care - I was not interested in the movie anyway - But these people seemed to enjoy scoring a few cheap points!Well, It took until now, But I finally sat back and watched SOLO: A Star Wars Story...And... Its actually pretty good!Lets start with a very basic Story - The overall Synopsis is that Han is an Orphan on a planet where Children are essentially treated as Slaves, Desperate to escape - He and his love interest try to stow away on a Space Vessel only for her to be captured... Promising to return, Han signs up for the Imperial Navy and his adventures begin, Seriously, That's all you really need to know Story-wise... And that for a start is a good thing for me! Keep it basic.... Don't over complicate a plot and you will have my attention! The movie is simple and plain Popcorn Entertainment - It does not need to be complex though it does have a lot of characters to introduce.Alden Ehrenreich as Han Solo was possibly one thing that did throw me off when the film was first announced - I do not know him as an Actor, and I felt he looked wrong for the part. I am happy to say that this was a mistake. He actually manages to pull off a very convincing performance that shows the vulnerability of youth but also leads into the more belligerent Han we know from 'A New Hope' - I know some people are still not happy with this, I think after 40 Years of Star Wars fans have become use to Han being the smug son of a gun smuggler so having him actually being Weaker in anyway is an insult to them! Honestly, I do actually feel I was maybe one of those fans too... But realistically, Han was NOT always the man we see in the Main Trilogy - Everyone starts somewhere.Ehrenreich's Portrayal is very convincing... He handles the part well and I was pleasantly surprised!However, And I am very sad to say this as I do adore Emilia Clarke, But her portrayal as Qi'ra - Han's Love interest, was not so good! I do not feel this was her fault... This part of the story was more of an after thought in a film that has SO MUCH going on that its is hard to keep a focus on any single story arc... Clarke really does do her best to sell the part, and by the end when her true motives are revealed (SPOILERS: Love has taken a back seat ENTIRELY... She is fighting to survive and Han is now just a tool to her survival!) - It comes across well, but due to the constraints of time and needing to keep the focus on Han, it does come across as a rather lacklustre reveal.Woody Harrleson as Beckett was possibly the most surprising role to me... I do not know why as he is a very versatile Actor and has played Bad Ass Characters in the past - I guess maybe some of my own pre-disposed biased crept in and I felt he was wrongly cast - And I was very wrong!I guess I should discuss the Elephant in the Room...I doubt that there is a single review that has NOT at least Mentioned the subject... Is teh Movie pandering to SJW Agendas?It has been well covered now that in a Q&A with the Crew of SOLO... Someone from Disney was asked about Lando Calrissian played by Danny Glover - Who may I just add is BRILLIANT! - and his Sexuality... Mainly as there is a plot thread that suggests he is in love with his Female Co-Piolot Droid (L3-37) - And the Crew Member stated something about Lando being 'Pansexual' - Needless to say this was immediately jumped on by the various YouTubers and Commentators who wanted to attack the movie.Well, I watched - And I was expecting something in your face... But what I saw instead was actually nothing like what was being echoed by many wannabe critics.
There is an element of question to Lando and his relationship with L3-37 - But that is the idea... Its a QUESTION! L3-37 Claims at one point that She feels Lando has irrational feelings to her with her being a Robot... BUT THAT'S IT! Yes, When L3 is Destroyed... Lando is Upset... But it does NOT in anyway hint at Lando having Sexual Feelings - People do over time develop attachments to physical objects... I remember breaking down in tears when my first ever PC bought the farm, I did not have emotions of love towards the machine... but it was my lifeline! The idea in the movie from what I saw was that L3-37 is designed to think as human as possible and may infact read Lando's attachment to a piece of equipment as emotional... reading more into him than is actually there! It is never suggested at any point that there is an actual relationship... or at least not the way critics want to read it.It is actually very open ended, read it how you wish - You will see from their interactions what you want to see... To me it was more how I felt when I lost my first PC - It was a major part of my life wand while I had no sexual feelings for the machine, it still hurt me emotionally when i had no freedom (The Internet)...Likewise, L3-37 is Rebellious and sees Droids as being Slaves... Many have once again jumped on this as some kind of Political Narrative as L3 is Female and its about female Empowerment and forcing SJW Agendas... What they all failed to see was that this was ABSOLUTELY DONE for HUMOUR!Every-time L3 tries to 'Make a difference' - She also does NOT think through her actions... And they normally cause more issues than there were in the first place... If I were to explain every single one of these - It would really harm your enjoyment of the movie as they are also some of the funniest scenes. This is actually very realistic and takes a fun spin on this very real issue. In fact, I would even dare to say that the writers were EXPECTING These commentators and DELIBERATELY played this way with L3-37... Not only is it actually funny and should make us think about our Thoughts compared to our Actions... The best of intentions can go wrong of you do not know the consequences of what you are doing.So - Yes there is a Political Narrative in the Movie, BUT unlike what you will have been told... It is NOT Pandering - If anything it is deliberately having a laugh at the expense of so called 'Social Justice Warriors'Though Disney do need to watch what they say in future as they end up feeding trolls rather than combating them.Effects - I am pleased to say that Effects wise, Things remain a high standard... I am not sure how many Practical Effects were used throughout the film, but they blend well with the CGI elements and the film as a result looks amazing. It can be Quite dark at points, but this is simply due to a very Gritty Story where colour would actually be inappropriate to the drama taking place on screen. Yes there will be people NOT happy about that, but it does help set the mood for the various set pieces.Flaws - Yeah, There are flaws in the Movie... One that will annoy George Lucas as it makes his Special Edition of 'A New Hope' look totally redundant is Beckett teaching Han not to trust anyone - As HAN SHOT FIRST... And this film PROVES WHY!The flow of the movie is somewhat jumbled, Easy to follow but its seems more like Set-Piece after Set-Piece rather than a flowing Narrative until the third act!And finally - Fan Service... OH YES THERE IS INDEED A LOT OF FAN SERVICE!!! But it also confirms some things as canon that people have been BEGGING FOR! SPOILERS - The Fate of Darth Maul... We now KNOW there will be a Darth Maul Movie to come! (Really, I should have seen this twist in the movie coming - I am more than aware that Star Wars - rebels is Canon to the Movie Universe... But I was Genuinely Surprised to see Darth Maul appear in the film!)FINAL THOUGHTS:This is simply a Story that DID NOT NEED TO EXIST... No one really wanted the 'Life Story of Han Solo' and it serves more as a movie to set up other Star Wars Spin-off Movies... Its easy to guess there will be a Lando Movie (Which actually could be interesting!), Certainly a Darth Maul Movie... It does its job as a Pseudo-Prequel but does not really go that far into developing the Main Character of the story! Rogue One this is NOT...But what it does, It does well... Its fun! It's action packed, Its a great Popcorn Movie and very well acted.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

381,Zingbot_9000,Not that Bad Folks at the same time Not that Good Folks,6,14 June 2018,"The spectrum of votes here is laughable. I honestly don't get how anyone could rate this movie a 1 or 2. It is not that bad. It really was just an average movie. I think slightly better than average. But to say this is a 9 or 10 also is laughable, how do you rate a movie which is truly great? Here are my beefs. First off, too dark. It was like the movie was tinted. I don't see how anyone could watch this in 3D as the movie is too dark for the dark tint of the 3d glasses. One of the things that makes Stars Wars good is that it is Eye Candy. The older movies were Beautifully made. Here it looks like you are viewing the movie through someone's Hangover. The casting was fine. I though this young Han was a good cast. Lando was fine also. I heard that that Ron Howard was brought into this movie because the original director made it with too much comedy. I think most of the comedic elements were striped. It was a little too serious. Maybe they are talking about crazy unrealistic action sequences. I thought the Space Train scenes were a little over the top. Other than that it was fine. The problem here is that this movie is another step backwards in that it loses a lot of the original Star Wars feel. I was hoping since this was about classic characters they would try to capture that more. Plot was simple enough with a few twists. Entertaining enough, but not great. At this point I wish George Lucas was used more. I think gone are the good days of Episodes 1-6. I view it like Rogue One...except I did not like Rogue One at all. For this I walked out saying.....it was ok, but I was not exactly thrilled.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
382,xiaoli7377,"Not Necessary, But Welcomed",8,15 September 2020,"""Solo: A Star Wars Story"" is the better of the spinoff films, mainly because it has interesting characters, a fun plot, and a western zing to it. It's refreshing to watch this and ""Rogue One"" after the franchise has gotten really stale in its presentation of epic saga-style movies. The smaller scale and tighter focus gives us better opportunities to connect with characters, and it also gives the filmmakers more freedom to break out of the trilogy formula that would restrict some of the risks that these ""Story"" movies should take. Unfortunately, as with ""Rogue One"", ""Solo"" molds itself a little too tightly to the rest of the franchise clichés and story hooks to make itself truly stand out. Some background knowledge required to fully understand what's going on prevents ""Solo"" from being a truly solo film (sorry about the pun). I think that it's better than ""Rogue One"" because of the way that it gives us better characters. This may be because ""Solo"" relies on pre-existing characters from the saga, whereas ""Rogue One"" had to give us completely new characters. But I also thought that Donald Glover was spectacular as Lando, and I honestly kind of prefer his take on the character to Billy Dee Williams. Woody Harrelson is also really cool as Tobias Beckett. Alden Ehrenreich does a decent job as our main character, but he's no Harrison Ford.""Solo"" takes place about a decade before the original ""Star Wars"", with Han Solo (Ehrenreich) living as a lowlife thug on Corellia with love interest Qi'ra (Emilia Clarke). They both manage to escape, but Qi'ra is separated and joins the gangster organization Crimson Dawn, under leader Dryden Vos (Paul Bettany). Meanwhile, Han joins the Imperial Navy and spends the next three years fighting in the trenches on remote planets. After a run in with Tobias Beckett (Harrelson), Han and new Wookiee friend Chewbacca (Joonas Suotamo) team up to rob a shipment of coaxium for the Crimson Dawn. The robbery goes awry, Dryden Vos sends the group to the spice mines of Kessel to retrieve more coaxium. Along the way, they recruit Lando Calrissian (Glover) and take flight aboard his ship, the Millennium Falcon.It's a fun movie, and I like the western style. It doesn't take a whole lot of risks in the story-telling department; it's pretty predictable and hits all of the backstory parts that we already knew about Han from previous films, and it also relies too heavily on previous films for complete outsiders to get a whole lot of enjoyment out of it. If you're a ""Star Wars"" fan and you really like the Han Solo, Chewbacca, and Lando characters, this movie is a fun time and you'll really enjoy it. It doesn't reinvent the wheel or anything. If you're unfamiliar with the franchise, this probably isn't the best place to start.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
383,ellimic,A very good film,10,27 May 2018,"A very good film, and after the last Star Wars spin-off (a really bad film) I'm glad they did Han justice.I'm glad they gave Han a spin-off, besides Palpatine he might be my favourite character.I liked the story of how he met Chewbacca, it tied in with the sketchy back story I'd been told by friends in the past.The whole story reallly showed how Han fell in love with the Falcon, which was edident throughout the Original Trilogy, and how he won the Falcon from Lando at the end tied in with his comments on the subject on Cloud City in Episode V.The appearance of Darth Maul was unexpected - I had to look that one up online to understand it as I never saw the Clone Wars animated series.Maybe a sequel will be out next year?

384,paulspencer-90394,The Dukes of Bio Hazzard,5,30 May 2018,"First off, its better than The Last Jedi, but that wasn't difficult. The cons were the lighting. A lot of it was dark or back lit. This is understandable if you are filming in the cockpit of the Millennium Falcon; but every scene? A director once told me that if the actors are not hitting their part, you could film them in medium shot, over the reactions of others around them. The last option is to darken everything so that you cant see the faces, and this is what it felt like. Even in daylight it was difficult to see characters acting. The story itself wasn't too bad, but clearly there was an issue with pacing. Inciting incidents were quickly introduced, and dragged on. But credit to Ron Howard, who had to work with a half completed film.
 The pros, Paul Bettany was very good, and Donald Glover shone. If they make a second Solo, it has to be in partnership with him. They had all the best scenes. In the end I walked out of the cinema thinking that this film suffered from the modern complaint of being too long, and coming out the same time as other movies that are very similar. Would I watch it again? At least on my television I can adjust the lighting.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

387,Thekeybaldemasterrises,About as mediocre as you could imagine.,7,26 May 2018,"""Solo a Smuggler's tale! Or something stupid like that""- Rich Evans from Red Letter Media. Solo A Star Wars Story is pretty much what you'd think it be. Safe and forgettable. I wanted to find something to salvage from this movie and thank goodness it's not completely manufactured. Alden Ehrenreich is actually decent as Han. Probably the most genuine performance as the character since Empire. He's no Harrison Ford but he's got the Ford expressions down. Especially Donald Glover as Lando. I always wondered why Lando pronounced Han's name differently from everyone but small details like that in Solo are what make the film a little more enjoyable. The Han and Chewie dynamic is probably the heart of the entire thing. But even that feels by the numbers so you just go ""that's cute"" but never really feel invested in it. That's probably the biggest Achilles heel of this movie is it truly lacks any soul. It's playing it so safe, making the movie forgettable and creating unneeded backstory. Just for fun I wanted to see what I could predict going into the movie and these were my notes before I walked in the theater. 
Han Solo is an orphan 
He meets Chewbacca in a prison 
He wins the Falcon at a poker game 
He learns not to trust anyone because someone betrays him. Woody or Emilia. 
The ship makes the kessel run. Now you could say well everyone knew that going in but I just want to prove how calculated and safe this movie was. The fact that I knew all that going in is just really mind boggling for me. You'll notice on my profile I've been very positive towards Disney's Star Wars films but this was genuinely the first one I had mixed feelings on. I didn't hate it, but didn't love it. I think kids will like it fine. But older fans just go decide for yourself. If you're curious I would just go. It can be fun and you might enjoy yourself. But if you're going into it already against it then you'll obviously hate it the entire time. I think Disney needs to reevaluate their approach on the Star Wars brand. People say Kathy Kennedy is to blame but I think it's just the entire business model as a whole. It's working for Marvel but not for Star Wars. We're getting a new movie every year and people aren't even liking them. I suggest after Episode 9 or the supposed Kenobi film that's coming out to take a step back and really evaluate their business model. If Rian Johnson's really coming back to do a whole new trilogy then take some time making them. We had to wait three years between each film in the OT and even the prequels. Really take the time to tell a more meaningful story that has some sort of soul to it. Otherwise people will stop going and Star Wars will just be run into the ground for good. For now Solo is ok, not terrible but not good. 6/10.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
388,dwankan,Couldn't Finish It,2,7 January 2019,"As a SW fan, I didn't expect much from this one, and I was still disappointed. This is not a Star Wars film but rather a formulaic, looping heist flick involving Star Wars characters. The plot barely exists. Once Han finds the girl he's looking for, far too coincidentally and with no real emotion, there's no reason to keep going, but that's about 1/5 into the film. The rest is repeated scenes of Solo and crew trying to steal stuff and run from guards and gangsters, annoyingly repetitive and not at all moving a story forward. Eventually (about an hour into it) I realized I hadn't paid attention to the past fifteen minutes of what was going it, but I was looking at another almost identical sequence of Han and Chewie and the other quirky stereotypes running from some armed people. I had a flashback to the Scooby Doo loops of the characters running from the guy in the mask, repeated ad nauseum with the theme song, also on loop. This movie may have worked better as a cartoon in the early 80s.
Don't bother with this one. It's pointless.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
389,twbond-00867,Still has some Star Wars excitement!,7,25 December 2018,"It's a fun movie!! Solo: A Star Wars Story is a popcorn flick directed by a talented Hollywood Director (Rush, Apollo 13) with some good entertainment that fills some gaps in for the Star Wars world. Alden Ehrenreich is fine as Han, but Harrison Ford still claims the franchises' protagonist.What it delivers, is enough energy to watch an entertaining 135 mins of Star Wars fun. No lightsabers really belong to this movie, but it has enough fun to make the audience want to keep watching the intriguing action it carries. Han and Chewie's friendship don't quite reach the comedic dynamic duo as the original partners in crime, but they still give you a surprising introduction to both Solo and Chewie (surprisingly known as a a slave in this movie) to their upcoming adventures together across the glorious galaxy.Landon Calrissian played by the popular, 21st century artist: Childish Gambino, a.k.a. Donald Glover, stylishly entertaining. His great performance make this movie fun enough to understand an itchy backbone behind the character. It's fun!!All in all, the movie was fun.

391,rupert-ian,All over the place,5,25 May 2018,"First off, I expected to hate this movie much more than I did. I actually thought it started out OK, except it tied everything from the past movies into the first 20 minutes. It's like they had a checklist and raced to complete it. Learning the origins of things like people's nicknames and where they got certain items shouldn't have been a race. After that, the movie was all over the place. Good in parts, and horrible in others. You could tell this thing had horrible issues during production and that different people were in charge of different scenes and dialogue. One of the main characters swapped sides so many times it simply got old after a while. Are they good? Are they bad? I just don't care anymore. That kind of plot twist can be done in a interesting way, this wasn't. The ""big"" action scenes weren't very big, and you just didn't care enough about the characters or their motivation to be at the edge of your seat. In all, it was a step up from The Last Jedi. I don't feel like they spat on the original characters of Han and Chewie like they did Leia and Luke in TLJ. Nobody used the force to imitate Mary Poppins in this one, so that's a plus. I thought Han was acted decently. Lando, not as much but it wasn't bad by any means. I liked Emilla's character until the last 25 minutes or so where it feels like they forced in a plot twist or surprise motive. The ""big cameo"" seemed really forced and out of left-field, but not in a good way where you'll say ""OH THAT'S AWESOME!""More like it was thrown in at the last minute to attempt a big cameo combined with a plot twist nobody needed or wanted.Disney needs to get some competent writers and directors at the helm who care about and love the original material.

It felt just like ""who cares"". Just too many ""if only the sliding door hadn't shut"" moments in the film. So since they can be put in at any time, there is no reason to invest in a plot arc. The film was like breathing. The action rises and falls, and that keeps you alive, but it doesn't particularly get your brain juiced or your hear racing. The chemistry in the ""romance"" part of it was rubbish. The heart felt sympathy for the nascent rebellion was ""meh"". The movie tried so hard to deviate from our expectations as a way to make us pay attention, that I just stopped caring. Oh, so you know Han won the Falcon in a card game? Well, I bet you don't know WHICH card game?! So you know Han and Chewie were smugglers but I bet you didn't know how that REALLY met?! Yeh, I really don't care. I just want to be entertained. When it started out, Star Wars entertained us with cool new things, like droids, hyperspace, blasters, etc. No they are just trying too hard to set up their own cinematic universe by dropping phrases like ""___ >sea cow< milker"" (Oh, so that's what was going on in TLJ"".

However, I decided that if I actually put aside my fandom of only wanting Harrison Ford to be Solo and just tried to judge this movie on its own merits - it was actually a good movie. I'm a simple man when it comes to movie reviews: did I enjoy it or not? Yes, I did. Is it worth the money to see in the theater? Yes, it is. I had read all the stuff about having to bring in acting coaches, etc and all the other behind the scenes trauma on the movie and I never noticed anything in th emovie itself that would have led me to believe that all that stuff happened. Whatever pieces Ron Howard had to pick up to make a good movie, he managed to do it. The pacing was good and even though I am not a fan of other franchises copying the ""Marvel"" tone of movies with lightheartedness and humor (which was terribly out of place in Ep 8!) I felt it actually worked in this movie because I think it fits with Han's personality - so I gave a pass there. All in all, it is actually a solid movie. I should probably rate it a 7, but who am I kidding the kid in me that still loves star wars bumped it up to an 8. The bottom line is this is a well done, fun paced movie for a night out at the theater; I suspect the only people who really won't enjoy it are those who come into it already hating the idea of a Solo prequel and never let that go.

The cast is a prefect example of something I enjoy about this movie the cast gives it all and they are all good in this movie the main standout though is donald glover as landó he just embodies lando and he is easily the best part of this movie. The relationships between all the characters are pretty good to but the main relationship that is great here is for sure Han and chewy who carry this movie on there backs. The action scenes in this movie are really good too. There is some scenes that as a Star Wars fan had me smiling. But where the movie starts to fail is this movie does rely to much on Star Wars references like oh this has to do with Han Solos past let's just throw it in here and that sadly doesn't make for a good movie. The pacing in this movie is awful to when your movie starts picking up at an 1 hour in and that's when the movie actually starts getting good then you know your movie has a problem. The villain in this movie is not even the villain there is not even a set villain till the movies climax which is just very disappointing. But this movies biggest issue is it doesn't feel like it is apart of the Star Wars universe it just feels like it's here so we can have a Han Solo movie that doesn't even feel like a Han Solo movie. Overall, solo is a fun movie that I just think it's okay. Is this movie awful, no and is this movie amazing no, it's just okay.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

398,tlfirth,"True to Star Wars, but lacks justification for its own existence",7,25 May 2018,"Apart from the animated Star Wars: The Clone Wars, this is possibly my least favourite Star Wars film. That being said, it's still a rollicking ride with a checklist of events that happened in Solo's life that are visually envisioned. Most notorious among them is the Kessel Run. But this isn't just a film about Solo, it actually covers the basis and background for many of its other characters, including Chewbacca, Lando and both newcomers Qi'ra and Tobias.In reality, Solo does everything it set out to do with precision and without mistake, it's just that most of the fans already know what's going to happen, and that's a big problem with the film - the anticipation has already dissipated before it's even begun. However, seeing the characters in a different light helps eleviate that disappointment, and there are some really exciting moments that have no right to be. This is supported by hundreds of references to the Star Wars lore - including Kashyyk, Pykes, Tatooine, the Empire, Dathomir. There's one particular reference I won't include, strictly because it is the one thing adds new fuel to the canonical story of Star Wars, and is a pretty cool moment for devoted fans of the franchise.Performance-wise, the standouts are Donald Glover and Woody Harrelson. Donald Glover in particular for giving us the best alternative Lando we could ever have had after Billy Dee Williams. He has so much charm and sarcasm throughout the film, and his story fulfills itself nicely in preperation for his appearance in Empire Strikes Back. His fellow droid, however, I'm not so sure about.In truth, there's not much new energy this film can give to the franchise, but it's a nice pit-stop for fans to recahrge their knowledge and get a breath of fresh, comedic air. There's no doubt, the youngsters will love this one for its fast-paced, hearty approach, but for the adults, it's a little too slapstick and unrestrained. It will hopefully give you a smile though as it did for me.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
399,jchano123,Empty and predictable,5,5 June 2018,"The exposition at the beginning of the film was super clunky and forced, and the entire story was so basic and painfully predictable. It felt like it was going through a checklist of things that needed to happen the entire time, leaving it feeling very empty.Ehrenreich tries to do his best as Solo, but I still just don't see him as Han. All the characters felt like they fit in the universe, but not the character they say they are, even Lando and Chewy. This whole thing would've worked so much better as a complete standalone film, unrelated to the main story.Other than that, the cinematography felt really sloppy and uninspired. Way too many poorly executed handheld and shakycam shots and most of the movie was difficult to see since it was so dimly lit. However, I did really appreciate the set design.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
400,DragoonKain,Possibly the best Star Wars film since Return of the Jedi,9,28 December 2018,"It's a shame this one failed at the Box Office because it's a really good film. I think the failure really did come down to bad timing. Coming out so shortly after the bomb that was TLJ, many Star Wars fans were just so soured by another Disney cash grab that diluted the once good name of Star Wars.But those who missed it should give this one a chance. Ron Howard is a much more capable director than Ryan Johnson and the script for this film was also quite good. I must admit that I am enjoying these side stories in the Star Wars universe much more than the actual mainline sequel episodes. Rogue One I enjoyed more than TFA, and Solo was way better than TLJ. Indeed I think I enjoyed it more than all of the recent Star Wars movies I've seen, and that includes the prequels ... although perhaps not episode III.There were a lot of things about this film that made me feel like I was watching a classic Original Trilogy Star Wars film for the first time. Probably the biggest is that the characters in this movie were, for the most part, all very like-able. There were a few, like Lando's droid, who was a little annoying at times, but her arc was interesting and she was definitely a memorable character.Woody Harrelson's character was probably my favorite of the bunch. It's been a long time since we got a character this charismatic and well portrayed in a Star Wars film and it was refreshing. It may seem odd to say, but he was sort of the ""Han Solo"" character of this film, whereas Han himself was the more innocent Luke-type protagonist. You can see how Han adopted the more cynical bad boy attitude after the experiences he went through in this film.The actor who played the young Han, Alden Ehrenreich, did a fine job, but he's no Harrison Ford. That was probably the only real problem I had with this film. but honestly I can't blame him or anyone involved for that. I probably would have liked it less if he attempted to do an exact impression of Ford's Han Solo. He did it his own way, which was admirable ... but still will never be able to compare to the original I grew up with. Donald Glover played a young Lando Calrissian, and his impression was more spot on to the way Billy Dee Williams originally portrayed it. I think a closer impression worked better for Lando, a supporting character, because he had less screen time.So good characters, good script, great action and special effects means you should definitely check this one out. I know a lot of people were complaining about the lighting in this film, but I saw it on bluray and didn't see any problems with it. It could be that they fixed it for the bluray release ... or maybe I just don't notice those things. I wouldn't be surprised if that's the case.Regardless, definitely give this one a shot, and I hope the low box office numbers doesn't discourage Disney from making more Star Wars side stories like this. TBH I don't really care too much about the Episode VII and VIII setting. But stories that take place in the Prequel or Original Trilogy setting still do interest me and would love to see more of them.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
401,thinkMovies,Synthetic milk from a cloned cow,1,1 November 2018,"When in the opening frames I saw young Han in a high tech Dickens London kind of environment I thought to myself, hey kid, you're gonna be murdered by your own son you will have with a princess. I wonder how Ron and the mighty Mouse didn't figure that everyone watching the opening scenes already knew the eventual end of that kid. They should have had a little more of a tragically poetic lead-in, guiding our feelings into the past. Something more lyrical, to resurrect in our hearts the old man with the light saber in his gut into this young man with all his life still ahead of him. To say nothing of giving us some emotional way to accept that he would come to love our princess more than the girl who got left behind at customs, while the mob that was chasing him could not, for some reason, get him after he passed the security check point. But this is a movie made for an audience with ticket money as worthless as their thinking processes.When I went to the premiere of Star Wars we didn't know to call it ""A New Hope"", or that there would be episodes, or that we were starting from #4. We were young, with all our life ahead of us back then. And that kid, Lucas, delivered to us a masterpiece, even though Sir Alec did not get it; he delivered too, anyway. We forgave George for episodes one, two and three and we could not, in our later years, but congratulate him on selling our youth to Disney for what? Four billion bucks? Good for him.But real, genuine cows come only once in a long while. You can only milk them so much before you have to clone them either because they are too old or you just want more milk. Or both. This movie is just a supermarket shopping list of items that need to be put in the shopping cart. Devoid of soul.

Everybody does bad things but they're not bad, just people trying to survive & has their good side (like in real life). It has a good persecution sequence at the beginning and some parts of the movie are exciting; you feel the aventure and the great universe of Star Wars, but sometimes it's seems to be insipid and without soul. It's fine to watch how Solo and Chewie meet for the first time. Weak villain, Paul Bettany (Dryden Vos. Alden Ehrenreich (Han Solo), Donald Glover (Lando Calrissian) are good characters in general, Emilia Clarke (Qi'ra), Woody Harrelson (Beckett) and Joonas Suotamo (Chewbacca) do their part; some characters of this universe are pretty untapped, i hope for the next Boba Fett spin-off they have a good homage and fix well so that this universe is finished.

403,Mynameisroman,"""Trust no one""!",7,5 June 2018,"That could be the subtitle of the movie and the title of all the bad press this movie got! the bad press is not necessarily wrong but they exaggerate things a little too much.
In fact Its really a solid Sci-Fi Movie set in the Star Wars Universe. Not more, not less. The actors are all well selected! Han is believable and so is Lando and Chewy and everyone else. They all play their parts perfectly and i can't imagine any other actors in those role except the original actors of course when they were younger. 
The only character i didn't like was that droid. i thought she was extremely annoying but the droid has limited screen time so its not another jar jar.
The plot is kept simple but has a lot of twists here and there that makes it fun to watch. 
The main thing i have to critizise is dialogue and ""fan service"". 
Yeah it might be fun to show a scene or two that makes you remember that almost exact scene from the original triology but its only fun the first time you watch it. the next time its probably only annoying. they should completely stop doing this! Episode 7 was a enough as an homage. that should suffice.
The dialogue was also no fun at times. people just don't talk like this. with improved dialogue the movie could have been much better. Especially in extreme situations less dialogue is better than too much of it. My actual rating is a 6.5. with better dialogue, less fan service and a better droid character this could have been a 7.5",Solo - A Star Wars Story

The movie had a lot of good scene like the one in the beginning on the train and in the end when Han fights Vos.

The few Easter eggs and call backs to the original series were recognized and appreciated as well.Don't think the movie deserves the hate it's received, but it's definitely not perfect.

Well it doesn't really offer anything new to the franchise, it's just more of the same baring many similarities to the previous entries. At times it feels like some of the scenes were just copied from those films. There is no real sense of jeopardy and even though people die, they are not given a good enough story for us to even care. With it being a prequel/spin-off, it takes away any excitement knowing Han and Chewie will end up fine.There are some good things to take away from Solo - Alden Ehrenreich does a good job in role bringing his own style to it as a more youthful, down to earth guy. Donald Glover is funny in the role of Lando, but he isn't in it long enough. Paul Betany is quite unpredictable as the menacing Drydon Vos, he plays him like a classic Star Wars villain, but he's only in it for about ten minutes. The opening chase involving hover cars is fun and a train heist midway through is quite entertaining. It looks great in terms of cinematography, special effects and set designs that look more faithful to the original trilogy. It's a great technical achievement, with the sound effects also being impressive. The only downside is the music score isn't as memorable as the other Star Wars films. Woody Harrelson is serviceable as Beckett, a scavenger who steals weapons for a living. Although Harrelson gets more screen time than others, the film is more focused on introducing other characters to an already bloated cast. The plot gets a little confusing towards the end which is probably down to the poor production of the film. Unfortunately it falls short of being great as the only things we learn about Han Solo is how he met his furry friend and how he got his ship. It's derivative at times with some dull moments, but it's not as bad as others will have you believe.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
410,iamianiman,Entertaining as How Solo Always be the One Who Entertains Us,6,21 May 2018,"SPOILER: We know epic adventures and memorable triumphs and lifelong bonds and in some cases Shakespearean tragedy await some of the main characters in ""Solo: A Star Wars Story.""We know where destiny will take them. We know, before they know.This is part of what makes ""Solo: A Star Wars Story"" so much fun. Every time a character says something that hints at a future catch phrase; every time there's a reference to an as-yet-unseen planet or a character who will show up later in the timeline; every time we get a glimpse of an iconic piece of equipment; every time there's an initial meeting between characters who will share a lifelong connection - we smile and nod and maybe even clap a little, because we know EXACTLY how it's all going to play out.The ""Solo"" story (superbly directed by the veteran Ron Howard, who took over after the original co-directors were fired over the time-honored ""creative differences"") takes place a decade before the events of ""Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope,"" which would put Han Solo's age right around 20.Alden Ehrenreich (""Blue Jasmine,"" ""Hail, Caesar!"") is quite a bit smaller than Harrison Ford and he doesn't bear much of a facial resemblance to the man who made Solo a legend, but Ehrenreich delivers a winning performance and does a fantastic job at foreshadowing certain characteristics and tendencies of Ford-as-Han, without delving into impersonation.Young Han is a cocky, independent wiseass specializing in small-time thievery and smuggling - and getting into big-time trouble. He's quick and smart and reckless and oh so green. (So green he doesn't even have a last name at the outset of this story. How he comes to be called ""Han Solo"" is a plot treat I won't spoil for you.) Han might one day become a great pilot - if he doesn't get himself killed first.Three years after having narrowly escaped arrest on his home planet of Corellia (called a ""sewer"" by one character, and we can see why), Han is still trying to cobble together the funds to buy his own ship so he can return and hopefully rescue Qi'ra (Emilia Clarke), his girlfriend and partner in adventure.Han's first meeting with Chewbacca starts with the big ol' Wookiee nearly killing him, and quickly progresses from alliance to true friendship. (Upon learning the big guy's name, Han notes he's going to have to come up with a nickname because he's not going to say ""Chewbacca"" every time.)Spotting an opportunity to make that elusive big score, Han talks his way onto a team of rogue criminals (with Chewy part of the deal). Woody Harrelson is the legendary career criminal Tobias Beckett, a charming and duplicitous sort who warns Han to never trust anyone, ever. Thandie Newton is Beckett's partner in crime and life, Val. Jon Favreau voices the multi-limbed Ardennian pilot Rio Durant, who takes an instant liking to Han.Han's former girlfriend Qi'ra resurfaces and joins the team, but her story is complicated and her loyalties are divided.Everyone in the ensemble is terrific - but the show-stopping, effortlessly scene-stealing performance of the movie comes from Donald Glover as the charming, suave, sneaky-smart gambler and pilot Lando Calrissian.Remember what I said about Ehrenreich not really resembling or imitating Harrison Ford, and yet doing such a great job? The same applies to Glover's interpretation of a younger Lando, who doesn't exactly become fast friends with Han but perhaps sees a little of himself in this arrogant up-and-comer. Ehrenreich and Glover click, whether they're facing off as rivals in a high-stakes card game, or having each other's back when guns are blazing and bombs are exploding.(I also loved Phoebe Walter-Bridge's voice performance as L3-37, a brave and funny feminist droid who is Lando's co-pilot and best friend.)""Solo"" of course has a number of massive, rapid-fire CGI action sequences, sometimes accompanied by snippets of the famous ""Star Wars"" theme. (There were moments in the 2-hour, 23-minute adventure when I could have gone for more quipping and fewer explosions.)The real treasures, though, are all those pre-iconic moments, all those launching points for beautiful friendships and future conflicts. In some ways this is one of the ""lighter"" of the ""Star Wars"" adventures, as we know beyond any doubt Han, Lando and Chewy will live to fight another day. (Not that there aren't moments of loss and sorrow and betrayal.)This is a prequel as a space Western summer movie, entertaining as hell but not particularly deep. ""Solo"" takes place in rough and tumultuous times - but there's very little philosophizing, no talk of the Force or what it means to be a true Jedi.Even if there weren't all those great ""Star Wars"" movies in our past (aka the futures of these characters), based on this adventure alone, I'd be excited to know what's next for Han Solo.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

Paul Bettany played a memorable villain - Dryden Vos is not only dangerous, unpredictable, sentimental, cunning, but also extremely charming. Interesting character. Chewie, Thandie, Emilia, rounded out a great cast. Fun to see Warwick ""Willow, Return of the Jedi"" Davis in the movie. This continues a good streak with the standalone Star Wars stories. Go see this movie on the big screen while you can and avoid spoilers.In my second viewing I was even more impressed by the score (bought soundtrack), cinematography/editing, and how much the movie is jam packed full of great moments leading up to an unforgettable ending.

I found it to be a fun heist movie with beautiful cinematography, great music, solid acting and several decent action scenes which kept me engaged.Alden Ehrenreich did a pretty good job as Han Solo, as I was worried that he would ruin the character, but again I was pleasantly surprised. The way he met Chewbacca and how their friendship developed was one of the best parts of the narrative to me as it felt organic. Donald Glover was excellent as Lando, whilst Woody Harrelson and Emilia Clarke, as Beckett and Qi'ra respectively, were good as supporting players. However, I found L3-37 to be extremely grating but thankfully she wasn't in the film too long so it wasn't a major issue.The main problem is the fact that the film doesn't take any risks. It feels very conventional and by-the-numbers as the narrative hits several predictable beats.

Since The Force Awakens they have proven that they are not afraid of the dark and gritty. Great! 
So why do I think Stars Wars has lost its magic? Because Disney don't know anything about moderation and anticipation. Its a bit like celebrating christmas several times a year. We are already full when we sit down at the dinner table, because we just left the table, and we don't look forward to the next one, because it is so soon after the last one. 
I don't know if my analogy is right, but given Solo's lacklustre performance at the boxoffice, it seems like the audience has started getting Star Wars fatigue. Way to many Star Wars movies in way to short a time span. 
And given many of the movies rather formulaic and quantitative qualities I think people start losing respect for them.
The effects leave me wanting for the awe found in the original trilogy, the stories leave me wanting for a better building on the mythology (instead of explaning and demystifying everything to death) and the writers need to write better stories instead of throwing every possible homage to the old movies into the mix. Homages are fun, but not in The Force Awakens kinda way, where they practically duplicate the script from one of the original trilogy movies. Come on, lets see some originalty people, the way Lucas showed us from 1977-1983. I need to be swept of my feet again!

I also know; immediately, that a dark movie, is just to save money.I really liked the story and how it related to the first Star Wars.

 They recasted Han Solo, due to Harrison Ford growing older, and he really just didn't capture who we have come to know as Han Solo. He was more official sounding, and even though he acted out crazy antics, the personality doing them just didn't match.

Upon the announcement of this film, the response was quite divisive; many were excited to see the origins of the beloved Star Wars character, while others were strongly against the possibility of Han Solo being ruined. Personally, I leaned more towards the latter as I was skeptical of the leading actor and I know that the main goal of this film was to make money. I just hoped that this was not to the demise of this film. Thankfully, the film was thoroughly enjoyable and I left the cinema smiling. Much to my surprise, Alden Ehrenreich embodied the character of Han perfectly, capturing the charm that Harrison Ford has created. He was a very strong lead and was also supported by the brilliant Donald Glover who was perfect for the younger version of Lando. As much as I love Emilia Clarke, due to Game Of Thrones, I don't think she was great in her role, which could very possibly be due to the fact that she was undermined by the two strong leading actors. The best thing about this film is the comic relief; although this is primarily an action/adventure movie, it contains the perfect balanced amount of humor that is the reason why I enjoyed this film to the extent that I did. It's smartly written, not over the top and suitable for the characters we have all learned to love. The weak point of this film is its plot, which is quite simplistic and messy. The motive of the film is all over the place, and the plot twists are predictable and thus unsatisfying. Furthermore, the editing in this film was quite poor, in comparison to the other Star Wars films, with choppy editing and questionable camera choices. Alas, as a Star Wars fan, there was a part of me that couldn't help but enjoy this film.

The young version of Han Solo is convincing and likeable and Han Solo is such a loved character from Star Wars that seeing him getting started out is definitely worth a look.As for the other characters: Chewbacca is predictably great, Beckett could have fallen flat with cliched dialogue and predictable twists but Woody Harrelson breathes life into the character and it works perfectly. Dryden Vos on paper is possibly the least notable Star Wars big bad since they tried to make Nute Gunray happen, except that Paul Bettany is so effortlessly charming and watchable that he actually comes strong compared to others. Emilia Clarke as Qi'ra is not bad by Star Wars female character standards, and again the credit mostly goes to the acting. Lando Calrissian also pops up, not as often as I'd hoped, but enough, and Donald Glover is perfectly at ease in the role.The plot's solid allowing for some great sequences, particularly near the start with the botched robbery. There's maybe a twist too far near the end, but it still works. The only real misstep is a certain man showing up at the end for no reason other than to shock, and no explanation for his presence - a twist that would be fine if there was any hope of it going somewhere but there isn't.So why only 7 stars for Solo if it's such good fun? Because, to be brutally honest, once the credits roll you probably won't think about it again. It's the only (live action) Star Wars film that doesn't feel like it matters. To anything. It's just a cool space adventure and not much else.It's a very enjoyable way to pass away a few hours but it's not going to stick around in your memory for long after I'm afraid.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

422,regula1,A Star Wars Story That Suffers From Both Sequelitis AND Prequelitis,6,25 May 2018,"Solo A Star Wars Story had an inherent problem with its concept going into production, as do many prequels: how to show genuine stakes in Han Solo's well-being when everyone on the planet knows he has to be alive for A New Hope and beyond.This film had a second problem, which plagues many sequels, and has been the fanboy's main complaint since Disney revived Star Wars in 2015: how to make a compelling story and not just be a bunch of tie-ins to A New Hope or the other Star Wars films that have come before.Unfortunately, and in spite of a valiant effort on a fairly compelling screenplay and Alden Ehrinreich being much better as Han than people feared during filming, Solo falls into both sequel and prequel pitfalls.Don't misunderstand: at the heart of this film, there is some compelling backstory for Han Solo as a character. Much like Rogue One, this film is not necessary viewing to enjoy Episodes 4 through 8 and beyond, but it is an entertaining supplement to what we already know. The main highlight of this film is the relationship between Han and Kira, played by Emilia Clarke, whom Han loved and was forced to abandon on his homeworld, only to reunite after three years and a lot of history later. Their chemistry is real, and I wouldn't mind seeing more from them.However, besides Han and Kira, really none of the other characters in this film are given much development besides some throwaway lines. Even Han meeting and getting to know Chewbacca feels somehow rushed and one scene of actual bonding is all we really get between them, and seemingly in the next scene they are best buds. Not the best character development ever.Finally, I won't reveal anything here, but let it be said that things get explained about Han in the dumbest wink-wink manner ever, and there are plenty of reveals, most being predictable as hell but one which is supposed to be shocking and make fanboys squeal, but me personally? It comes off as a massive WTF moment, and it killed a great portion of the goodwill this film had built up.So in the end, is this film an utter disaster, as everyone assumed it would be after a very troubled production? No, as there are definitely things to appreciate about it. Does it match up to Rogue One, the only other modern Star Wars spin-off? Nope. For the first time in Star Wars history, where the film is either great (Empire Strikes Back) or horrendous (The Holiday Special), this may be the first true ""meh"" Star Wars film, and for a franchise as famous and influential as Star Wars, that's pretty disappointing.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

428,SeriousMayhem,"Plain, clean, average, lacking that Star Wars feeling.",6,23 September 2018,"All in all I wasn't very impressed.The first scene immediately made me enthusiastic, not in the least because of the amazing musical score accompanying it. It wasn't spectacular, but promising enough and it seemed to set a certain tone that I personally liked. However, the movie only managed to hold my interest up until the point where Han and Qi'ra were seperated, which is around at the 15 minute mark. The movie then decides it needs to be something of a snorefest, only to pick itself back up again in the last 30 minutes. The entire middle part of the movie, slightly less than 90 minutes in length, is just not very interesting at all and only shows how much potential is wasted.Sure, there's plenty of action, but it didn't do much for me; it was just, there.. a collection of fight scenes, explosions, that's it. Sure, we learn how Han meets Chewie, and that was that, it was over. We see the dice a half dozen of times, the Kessel run, Han's gun, how Han meets Lando.. The movie just seemed to be moving from one mandatory reference to the next. Oh, don't forget to insert some stormtroopers and TIE fighters at some point. Check. Yes folks, we're watching a Star Wars movie - it apparently wants to remind us of. And yes folks, this is, indeed, Han Solo we're watching.Now, don't get me wrong, I didn't dislike the fact that we were treated to all that; the movie stays true to its roots and doesn't try to invent some kind of alternate version or reality (which are ruining many movies and franchises lately). But it just felt forced, not organic, and so clean, safe and sterile.. And by being so true to its roots, by playing it so safe in the way that it did, it doesn't manage to really create much at all, nothing innovative, and as such stays mostly very average and ultimately just not that interesting. I was missing that spark. I was missing that Star Wars feeling, in a movie about Han Solo no less..In the end, we didn't learn anything new about Han besides that he really knows how to stand somewhere smiling smugly. I felt I learned more about Lando for instance, simply by watching him and how he appeared on screen. It all fitted the image I had of him. And that's with much less lines and much less screentime.Maybe that was the point; a quick and clean history lesson of sorts, to which I say fair enough, I get it. I didn't overly enjoy it, but I get it. In the end, I'm not so sure we really needed this.Acting overall was decent to good. The music was decent to good as well, but sadly lacking variation.The featured ""humor"" was mostly unfunny (and present too often for my taste), something which Hollywood seems to excel at these days, apparently aimed at 10-year olds or so, I don't know what's up with that.. The droid L3 was cringeworthy.Rating it a 6,5/10. I don't feel it's worth a 7, so a 6 it is.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

433,matthewjloller,Fun but forgettable,7,3 July 2019,"Solo was possibly the most unique Star Wars film in that it does not necessarily fit with any of the trilogies. However, the feel of this movie is slick and fast-paced much like its protagonist which makes for a very easy watch. The movie looks fantastic and is acted quite well (especially Donald Glover). The jokes are in higher quantity than most Star Wars films, but that is not necessarily a bad thing as they mostly land. The film delves deeper into the extended Star Wars lore than any other of the movies and could ironically (because of its failed box office numbers) be considered a love letter to the hardcore extended universe fans of Star Wars. The movie has a lot of good action and will leave you smiling by the end. The main problem with the movie is that it is unbelievably forgettable. Almost nothing stands out in this movie. Its plot, characters, and villain are all fairly by the numbers. So as a whole Solo is a solid, fast-paced, fun, but ultimately disposable addition to the saga.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

But if you're capable of putting aside your own ideas of what this movie could've or should've been (which most Star Wars fans can't seem to do, in my experience), when it comes down to it, this was a really good time at the movies.

439,TheMunkeyBoy,Expected Little - Really Enjoyed it,8,6 June 2018,"I expected little because of the negative reviews and comments it has attracted, not because I think little of Ron Howard's capabilities or that I don't like the character of Han. Ron did a great job like so many of his movies. And I really wanted this movie to be great because, like so many others, I love the character of Han.
I just went in hoping for a little enjoyment form a side story in the Star Wars universe. I was hoping for a kind of great episode of SW Rebels or something. 
About half way through I realized I was really liking this movie. I could pick apart things I don't like or agree with but, I could do that to Empire Strike Back as well and that's one of my all time favourite movies. 
My advice, don't be a hater or someone waiting for Disney to fail - if you want faults then of course you'll find them. Enjoy the ride. A movie itself can't pull apart your fav childhood heroes and the universe they come from. It's a story and I think it's a pretty decent one for a character who is great. 
I didn't love The Last Jedi, I felt a little disappointed with it because of its change of character to Luke. But I still enjoyed watching. Solo: I just loved so much of it. 
I do feel like the best SW movies either have either only one or no Jedi in them at all. I believe that's where the Prequels went wrong - they thought everyone wanted to see lots of Jedi Knights. But the original trilogy worked so well without Jedi Knights running around everywhere. Solo has none (like Rogue One) and it works beautifully.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
440,politicidal,Good mixture of a space western and heist movie. Except it's also Star Wars!,8,3 June 2018,"The galaxy's most infamous smuggler gets the origin story treatment in this slick action packed adventure. Director Ron Howard not only managed to make a fun movie out of a notoriously troubled production but add further depth to Star Wars' most popular character-after Darth Vader.Alden Ehrenreich is a natural fit for a younger Harrison Ford while Donald Glover nearly walks away with his smooth impersonation of Billy Dee Williams. This pair of promising young actors are bolstered by strong supporting work by Woody Harrelson, Thandie Newton, and Paul Bettany. If there are weak links among the cast, it's Emilia Clarke in the thankless role as the love interest. She does some interesting things in the end but it's too little too late by that time. There are also two supporting characters meant to be comic relief. Neither are developed particularly well; one has an especially emotional departure yet is forgotten mere moments later. It was unsettling.The action scenes are exciting, thrilling, and the seedy grimy criminal underworld setting is a unique setting to distinguish it from other Star Wars films. Standout setpieces include a train robbery (yes like a western) and the much fabled Kessel Run. The third act is smaller in scale than the grand space battles or operatic lightsaber duels in other films. I found this refreshing as it fit in with the film's style as a crime drama-only set in the Star Wars universe.It's unfortunate that negative attention by the film press and disgruntled fanboys have resulted in a lukewarm box office performance for SOLO. The film is far better than it has reason being. For those that pine for the days that Star Wars meant pure escapist entertainment, SOLO is a good choice to have some fun.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
441,neobateman,"A unwarranted, yet mildly entertaining romp.",5,5 June 2018,"Solo: A Star Wars Story is the largely unwanted solo prequel of Harrison Ford's iconic character, Han Solo. The film is set approximately 9 years after the events of Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith (10 years chronologically before Ford would first play the role). This gives the story a bit of breathing space as the events that happened more close to Revenge of the Sith haven't been covered on film. The storytellers can give us things and tell us something about this iconic character and perhaps shed light on why he is who he is, a bit like what EON did with Casino Royale, giving the audience a story that explains and shows the effect being a secret agent has on James Bond. This is something Solo: A Star Wars Story attempts, but fails at quite miserably. The reason why the origins of James Bond worked and the reason why Han Solo doesn't is because there is a sense of depth added to Bond that is clearly missing in Solo. I never once got the feeling that Han went through any change at all, without spoiling, he felt too much like Han. Of course that is not a negative, however this does raise the question, why does this film exist. The biggest elephant in the room here is of course the recasting Harrison Ford with Alden Ehrenreich in the role of Han Solo. Ehrenreich has been known for supporting roles and found little success in mainstream Hollywood. I was probably in the minority when I heard about his casting, as I thought the choice was excellent. He has a undeniable charm and onscreen charisma that he brings to this film. When I saw him, I saw Han Solo. He gave a very convincing performance, keeping elements of what made Ford so iconic, whilst also adding his own twist/identity. The supporting cast is made out of Woody Harrelson, Emilia Clarke, Donald Glover, Thandie Newton and Paul Bettany. Most of these actors are given some limited material to really shine, especially Glover. He replaces Billy Dee Williams, but the change is honestly almost unnoticeable, he was so smooth and skeemy. He brought some of the film's strongest moments. Harrelson is serviceable as a mentor father figure to Han Solo, who teaches him the important lesson to ""Never trust anyone and you'll never be disappointed."". Scenes like these make Harrelson stand out, however many other scenes take the interesting elements about him away. Clarke shares some intimate scenes as a love interest to Han, some of which I thought pushed the boundary when it comes to Star Wars. This makes sense however as this tackles a different aspect of the galaxy and makes the adventure a little more mature. Bettany is threatening in a incredibly limited, almost cameo like role. There are some neat action sequences in Solo, especially a train heist (the one we all saw in the trailer). However that is basically it, this film is 135 minutes long, with maybe 45-50 where I was actually invested. This movie spends so much time on things that don't push the story along, this is why many things feel so slow and boring (boring almost to a prequels level). I checked my watch on multiple occasions as I was wondering when the film would end or until the next action sequence would start, the story is just way too thin for the run time. I am also sick and tired of the fan service in this film, there were many overt references to other planets and characters where I rolled my eyes, they don't add anything to the story or characters. They are just easter eggs for Star Wars fans, don't get me wrong I love good fan service, I am a huge Star Wars fan. However as a fan I expect creativity first and foremost, without George Lucas' crazy imagination and creativity we would not have gotten Star Wars. This is why I loved The Last Jedi, it felt like a fresh creative story that had an interesting twist on the franchise, it broke new ground. This film simply tries to satisfy fans by giving them what they love without the substance or passion that they deserve. If you disliked The Last Jedi for the decisions that were implemented by Rian Johnson (which is fine as we all have different opinions) then I believe you'll like Solo more as this film doesn't change or challenger anything about the beloved franchise.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

It takes a bit for you to accept Eichenrach as Solo but by the end, you can totally see it. Woody Harrelson was a fine guy to see, he's been getting better. Emilia Clarke was fairly good. The standout is, of course, Donald Glover as Lando. He's exactly what a young Lando would and should be.The writing was probably my biggest disappointment. If you know me, you know I love writing. I'm okay with this writing, but there wasn't anything too great. It didn't do anything you didn't expect, which was probably my main problem.The direction was uneven, no surprise.

I was convinced for a while that Deadpool 2 or even Infinity War still would outgross it. Unlike both those movies being well worth the millions they made, I unfortunately cannot say the same for Solo.That doesn't mean the whole movie is bad. Far from it. There was some good stuff in here, so I'll just list them off rapid fire style. Donald Glover as Lando is legitimately amazing, he's got the style and suave nature to pull it off perfectly. Most of the acting in general is okay. Most of the effects are also okay, nothing amazingly realistic but not too many that are awful either. Okay is the only word really to describe this film. If you wanna watch an okay space movie with one great performance go for it.That being said, it just being okay takes away from the film greatly. It doesn't do anything great, anything different, or anything to add bonus value to it. It hits all the beats you expect the movie to hit, and then it ends. Simple, plain... boring, stale. You could probably just watch the original trilogy and get ten times the enjoyment of Han.The equal rights robot as I've coined it was very annoying. Yes, equal rights is important. BUT! We're in space. A long, long time ago. In a galaxy far, far away. If equal rights is an issue there, you've messed up a lot. Why? Because there are many many different species interacting with each other always. The card playing scenes are a testament to that. Maybe the robot only wants equal rights for other robots, but then she leads a mass breakout with many many different species. The whole thing comes off as inconsistent, unfunny, and just ends up raising more questions than it does answers. Like who would program a robot with that level of self awareness? Were they asking for a quick robotic kick to the nuts?The reveal at the end with Maul isn't handled properly. His CG is almost complete garbage (again, nothing extraordinary, nothing extraordinarily bad), and he's on screen for only 20 seconds, tops. If you wanted this to work well you have to be actually in the room with him, and not just a hologram of him, and you also have to have him do something. If the movie instead got an actor in the makeup at the end, maybe as a post credit scene, and had him behead the traitorous love interest, then I would have given more points.Speaking of the love interest, the movie suffers the Rogue One problem of us already knowing what's gonna happen before it happens. None of the characters they introduce in this movie ever show up in any other movie that comes after, so you know they're either gonna die or... nah they're just gonna die. The love interest doesn't die, but judging by the talk she had with you-know-who, she might as well have. Paul Betanny's weak villain character dies, because of course he does. The mentor character dies, because of course he does. The equal rights robot dies, because thank god. As such, the movie is lacking stakes.I don't recommend this movie sadly. I was really hoping for my expectations to be defied and for this movie to do something unique and different. What I got was exactly what I expected; an average movie with nothing to it but the name. If you bring a bucket of popcorn and some great friends, it might be worth it. But you can make any movie work under those conditions. I likely won't watch it again till it comes out on DVD, so maybe seeing it again will change my opinion. But for now, I'd say give this one a pass.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

It stars Alden Ehrenreich (Hail, Caesar), Woody Harrelson (True Detective) and Emilia Clarke (Game of Thrones).This very watchable film directed superbly by Ron Howard is vey fun, and incredibly well acted.

The completely unbelievable version of a ruthless smuggler who owes the whole galaxy money and lives on the run. Nah, this is cutesy pretty boy Han, who's weakness would be savagely taken adavantage of among the space scum in that line of work. Point being; right off the bat, the character doesn't fit who he would need to be to believably live on the run breaking the law. So, now the fun part.

Matter of fact, it would be even worse if it wasn't bots working to keep the average score above 7. If these people are just average humans reviewing the movie, why do they care what other people think? It's almost as if it's really about not only feeling part of some arbitrary greater collective, but being the most loyal media slave. They need others to like the movie so they can know what to like; Actively fighting to deny Disney doing this for any other Reason beyond hi jacking & inserting subversive but subtle mind control into the most popular fictional franchise of all time. These people are clinging to a last shred of self dishonesty Bc they don't want their number one method of escapism taken away from them: leaving them only with the uncomfortable truth of which they've spent their whole lives sanding the edges down, if not running full speed away from it. All whilst being encouraged to do so subtlety underneath the surface of the 4-6 hours of tv watching daily. Throw phones into the equation and the average lemming is in front of a screen for 8-10 hours a day, happily and gullibly following the one directly in front of them off the proverbial cliff. When u start the review with not liking another movie, it's makes it sound real, ya kno? Like no one can watch this movie and actually dislike it, it has to be an attitude of disdain toward Disney that does it, or being a ""hater"".

Well I'll take it to the opposite side, I thought both the new trilogy episodes were awful(TFA especially, watch it after the buzz of it being a new continuation to the orbital story wears off if you haven't, and there's zero redeeming value to it) but really enjoyed ""Rogue One"". I was robbed of so many of my passions when Disney bought everything from Marvel comic books to Vice news(go ahead and google it, u didn't know they Owned the propaganda for hipsters mill), with the only intention of wringing them dry of every cent, until every piece of power is stripped from the storytelling and we can't stand to even hear the words Skywalker or superhero without becoming nauseous. When u own the full spectrum of media consumption (ESPN, abc, A&E, soon to be FOX, Pixar, marvel, Star Wars, I can keep going but I wont)it's about something far more sinister than simply financial gains. Club 33 y'all. Shhhhhhh! Anyone find the classic hidden weird subliminal messaging designed to wear down a child's moral compass and initiate them, unbeknownst, into an occult state of being? Back to the point ar hand. Steer clear of this garbage. Beyond the inconvenience of remembering the real Han thru out the flick and how terribly off The guy who plays this ""I didn't shoot first"" version of solo is; he's also an absolutely horrendous actor. The only redeeming quality of this movie is Emilia being super easy on the eyes with her beauty. Boba fett is the next character to be systematically decimated by the Disney machine. At least rent this or DL it so that Disney doesn't get their cut of the ticket prices.....there's an attempt at a story in here somewhere under the cheap nostalgia triggering cinematic tricks in between lowest common denominator WAY over CGI'd space chases and laser fights that trick your subconscious into believing you're watching a Star Wars flick. This movie could've literally been 45 mins long but somehow got stretched to 2.5 hours. Anyone looking for an actual well told solo origin story should turn to AC Crispin's Han Solo trilogy of novels from the late 90s, far superior; way more enjoyable and believably character driven, and Ron Howard doesn't over milk every emotional sentence, thank God!!!",Solo - A Star Wars Story

Sad to say the least.As to this film, it was a fun kick ass kids movie. Chewie was fun and had a far bigger part. Like all the Star Wars they are just fun. This one definitely had a style onto iys own. But thats Ron Howard. The only movie in the franchise that was bad was roug one but thats cause their two main characters were unlovable, couldnt wait for them to get killed off.

Solo: A Star Wars Story was fun. Nothing spectacular, just fun. I had a good time. I did feel like they were trying really hard to establish links and backstory to the Star Wars characters, storylines, and memorabilia I've already seen, but it's not that much of a flaw. I just hoped it was done a little more subtle. The story is very predictable, but again, I didn't mind. Normally, this kind of review would add up to a 6/10, but because it's more Star Wars and because of the decision to cast Phoebe Waller-Bridge as the droid L3, it deserves a 7/10.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

It is so much fun, the most fun since Empire Strikes Back, this movie is basically that sequence in the asteroid field but for 2 hours, this movie is enjoyable from start to finish. I was never a big fan of Han Solo but this movie made me more interested since we get to see a Han Solo who has yet to become the Han in the original trilogy. The Han Solo actor is very good, making his own take on the character that dare I say, challenges Harrison Ford's. Donald Glover is very good and makes Lando a very funny character, but is overall doing a Billy Dee Williams impression which isn't bad, he is very smooth as Lando should be. The music is fantastic by John Powell and an excellent pirate like theme for Han from John Williams. The acting is great, the music is excellent, the story if very good and fun. The only complaint I have from this movie is one specific scene towards the end, the whole movie feels like it should be leading to it, but it feels extremely rushed and should've taken more amount of time to set up.

A basic question I had ""Was the character someone who would shoot first?"" I was not disappointed. We know the character from the original Star Wars film, but his backstory was only hinted at in that film. The plot of this film was clever and the questions concerning the origin of the relationship between Han and Chewbacca, Solo's connection to Lando and acquisition of the Millennium Falcon, and others were answered. (And, a number of delightful Easter eggs were thrown in.) Ron Howard did an excellent job as director and delivered a product that will be appreciated by fans of the Star Wars saga.

468,pulikd,Fuel Runner,6,4 August 2021,"Unlike any other ""Star Wars"" movie before, ""Solo"" does not deal with the fate of the entire world, it is a small story about a handful of individuals facing life or death situations of their own concern only. What also sets this movie apart is how little outer space it has. That is not to say there are no strong visuals here, it is a beautiful combination of computer generated images and the real thing, which is highly welcome. Only the visuals in general could have been better. They look realistic and detailed, but they are also dark and bleak. This material was made in a good way, but the way chosen to present it to the audience wasn't as good.The plot could have been better as well. It may have over two hours to tell the story, but it doesn't quite work as an origin story. The titular character isn't treated with the proper attention. At least, the young Alden Ehrenreich wasn't a bad actor. The cast in general was good, especially Woody Harrelson and Paul Bettany. The collection of characters, however, fails to do without an annoying droid. Suffice it to say, the design of the machine itself is strange. It isn't even cartoonish, it is more like a caricature.As a new installment in an old film series, ""Solo"" takes the right basis, it focuses on little events, exploring things that wouldn't have been seen in a big ""Episode"" of ""Star Wars"", but things aren't exactly well. Unluckily for the audience, the creative vision suffered because of significant production troubles.

474,grantbullert,A Disappointing Addition to An Otherwise Well Developed Universe,7,8 July 2018,"""Solo: A Star Wars Story"" is a less-than-average addition to the Star Wars universe. It has a few good moments, but it falls flat for the majority of the film.-Analysis of Notable Work- *Writing/Directing: The film does not feel like an official Star Wars film, but rather as if it was made by fans. The technological aspects of the film are good, but the story does not feel like Star Wars. Ron Howard disappoints with this film. It is fun during some moments but it does not have that magical quality that Star Wars usually does. *Cinematography/Editing: The visual storytelling is unique and interesting, but not very similar to the Star Wars films we are accustomed to. Bradford Young exhibits a great amount of skill, but his style does not fit that of Star Wars very well. The editing is passable. There are a few moments that feel paced poorly, as well as some cheesy sound effects for some action sequences. *Dialogue/Acting: The dialogue is also very unrecognizable from Star Wars. It feels more like modern day Earth rather than a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away. Many lines are poorly delivered as well, mostly from Alden Ehrenreich. Though it is not his fault. He is a talented actor, but not fit for the role of Han Solo. He does not fit the characteristics or style of Han Solo. And it a film about Han Solo that is a problem. Most other actors do a decent job. Paul Bettany and Woody Harrelson earned their paychecks and nothing more. Emilia Clarke is weaker than most in this film, as is Donald Glover. They seemed to crack under the pressure of being in such a large fantasy world that Star Wars is. *Music/Sound Design: As talented as John Powell is, his score felt very dull and unforgettable. Again, it does not feel like Star Wars. The sound design held up to what can be expected in Star Wars for the most part, except for the few corny sound effects in some fights. *Production Design/Special Effects: The costume and sets felt rather dull and uninteresting. They fit into the Sci-Fi category, but not into Star Wars. Props were what felt the most like Star Wars in the production design department. The special effects were one of the highlights of the film. They felt authentic and had the typical Star Wars feel to them. It is what helped keep the film from falling apart.*Conclusion: ""Solo: A Star Wars Story"" is an entertaining film that will please Sci-Fi fans, but may disappoint Star Wars fans. It holds interest for a decent part of the film, but the story gets lost in modern day politics for too long. It may be worth seeing once, but probably not more than that.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
475,sagniknath,Not perfect but definitely doesn't deserve the hate,7,25 May 2018,"I went in to the theater with absolutely zero expectations, what with all the polarised audience and critic reactions to the movie. Notwithstanding the messy behind the scenes stories of the firing of the original directors at the last moment and doing subsequent entire reshoots as well as my personal distaste of the new unknown actor Alden becoming our favorite fictional smuggler. I just couldn't equate Alden to the enigma of a young Harrison Ford and he thus became a huge turn off. Many people in online forums were actually talking of boycotting the movie solely because of the presumption that Alden would totally mess up their childhood antihero. So keeping all of this in mind and completely letting go of any ideas, I braced myself for Solo: A SW Story.
 And I was pleasantly surprised at how entertaining the film was. The new kid Alden carries off his role like a charm. I could certainly see streaks of a young Harrison Ford in the performance. He is pretty short compared to Ford, but that difference in height actually helps accentuate the fact that this a still young relatively inexperienced Han Solo, which actually works to the plot's favor . Moving on, Donald Glover as Lando is a show stealer. I genuinely enjoyed his performance and wished he was given more screen time. Woody Harrelson does an alright job. Also, I really liked the chemistry between the young Solo and Chewbacca, which again didn't get as much focus as it should have. Finally, the first half of the film was downright fun and had good character development , dialogue and interesting set pieces.Now onto the criticism. The second half of the story has some confusing plot twists. The allegiances of the certain characters as revealed become a bit questionable in terms of character motivation. And finally, I didn't like either Emilia Clarke or Paul Pettany in this. Bettany especially feels like an overrated actor who delivers the same type of pseudo intellectual vibe into all of his performances , including his role here. Regarding Emilia, I think it were better off if the filmmakers completely removed her character and used the second half of the film to cement Han's relationship with Chewbacca and Lando.Overall, my advice is to certainly check the movie out if you just want to have some light fun and make sure you don't pay any heed to the haters.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

478,type-a1pha,A Star Wars Meh.,6,24 May 2019,"Another installment in the saga of Disney's Star Wars, which says it all: beautiful effects and cinematography decorating a shallow, lackluster narrative. It's the same problem afflicting all the episodes in this new era of Star Wars. No coherence, no inventive, obnoxious characters, unrealistic developments and the omnipresent unbelievable sequences of incredible coincidences make for an unrewarding experience. There's nothing interesting to look for. No lore, no character development, no significant twist. The movie is just a succession of events held together by the cosmic law of coincidence since, apparently, everything happens at the last possible moment. If you've seen Rogue One, then you're familiar with this kind of film-making. Not to say that the movie is abysmal. It's just average; very average in its story. There are also some of the most annoying and unnecessary things ever seen in the saga first and foremost the giant thing near the collapsing star; there are no words to describe it and how could it possibly make past script revisions. Overall the movie is just the umpteenth example of why story and characters are so important. In the end, it will be forgotten because there's nothing memorable about it.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
479,dellamorte-44869,Visually ugly,4,28 September 2018,I liked the movie as a whole but it's the most mediocre STAR WARS I ever saw. if I were to dissect it I thought it was visually horrendous (cloudy/dark/smokey/misty) it was so muted it was off putting. Every other Star Ward film despite green screen or no always looked well lite and creative. The performances range from mediocre to imitation as well. Solo should never have been recast this guy was admirable but felt NOTHING like a young Harrison Ford. While everyone praises Glover I felt he was a mere miming of BDW he brought nothing interesting. The droid was annoying AND ultra P.C in a very in your face kinda way. ALSO A TRAIN? In Star Wars? Can't they just land what they need where they need it they have space ships!

What we got was what seems like a highlights reel from a ten part 1 hour Netflix series. We get snippets of story with no character development. The early deaths don't mean anything as you don't get to know the characters. I came out of watching this thinking it should of been a event tv series telling the story in more detail, spend time developing the relationship between the main leads before splitting them up, let us see Han at the academy instead of the time jump to get to some action and meeting Chewie. Take time to tell how Han got involved with the gang. Build the love/hate relationship with Lando instead of making it an instant thing. Making this as a film was a wasted opportunity of what could of been a great tv series. Let's hope lessons are learnt and if this gets sequels they don't hurry the story",Solo - A Star Wars Story
482,asiduodiego,"A nice effort, but not enough to be a classic.",7,13 September 2018,"Solo: A Star Wars Story, is a fun thrill-ride, with good performances, nice vistas and, all in all good action and adventure for all the family. It's a competent movie, but it's still far below of what a Star Wars movie should be. The good:
In general, we can describe this movie as ""fine"". Performances, story, effects and action scenes are fine. Nothing remarkable really (except Woody Harrelson's performance, the highlight of the movie), but nothing bad or mediocre. People complain about the ""SJW droid"", but come on guys, it's a clear joke at the expense of SJWs, and it is barely in the movie at all. Everything is slightly above average, and with all put together, it's a nice movie experience.Regarding the ""Star Wars Universe"" stuff, this movie is remarkable in terms of actually exploring new angles of the Universe, instead of just maintaining the plot of ""Empire vs Rebels"", now the movie actually explore different aspects, stories and factions. It's not completely new, but it's a very welcomed change of focus. The bad:
The movie has some pacing issues, making it feel undeveloped and rushed at times. Characters motivations and personalities are not well explored, and it doesn't feel well developed, and this is the main flaw of the movie. In particular, regarding the last point, the character of Han Solo feels a little flat. He is ""the young maverick"", but aside for that, the character doesn't add much to what we know of Han Solo. I think his arc should have been going from idealistic to more cynical and rugged, but in the end, he's just a good and idealistic guy all along, and he really doesn't change much through the movie. It doesn't feel like a good character exploration, it feels like a lot of stuff happening to a pretty decent Han Solo cosplayer.(SPOILERS) For example, at the end, he just ends up helping the rebels, because ""it's the right thing to do"", which is cool, if this character wasn't Han Solo, whom, at the beginning of ANH, was a rugged and cynical guy. Perhaps he changed later on, but then again, if that's the case, what's the point of making the movie about a ""good guy"" just being ""a good guy"". You can do that, if you want, but not in what should be a character-driven movie. I don't know, but it feels pointless at the end.In the end, Solo is a good movie. Not great by any means, but good enough. I think it was harmed by coming to theaters too soon after the most controversial Star Wars movie ever, but I think it didn't deserve to flop so badly as it did.7/10",Solo - A Star Wars Story

Ron Howard did a great job & the story was excellent , the humour was well done & I loved all the new characters & villains especially that end cameo of Darth Maul - It blew me away ! It was also awesome to see the Kessel run & exactly how Han met Chewbacca & won the Falcon .

The story line was good directing fair, but the production was for some reason to clean ( it might have been the high res but everything in the show seemed clean) the aliens were cartoonish, even more so than other Star Wars.I would watch it again in a year or so, but that is only because of the story line.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
485,zenjunkie,An excellent Star Wars back story,9,26 September 2018,"I came to this movie without reading a single review. Without any expectations other than to be entertained. Without looking for something to gripe about.
And I was not disappointed.
I found this movie to be the best since the original trilogy. I loved it.
Once you've accepted that it's not Harrison Ford and moved on from that, it all becomes immensely enjoyable. And to be honest, that didn't take long. Alden Ehrenreich does a decent job of being Solo the younger.
For goodness sake people, Harrison Ford is too old to play the part - get over it.
This movie had the same 'feel' as Episode IV. Cinematically, it even looked kind of retro.
I'm not going into the plot or anything - it's simply the back story of Han Solo as alluded to in the original movies.
Yes, there's always some triviality either missing or perhaps slightly altered - but come on, who cares! Really!
Everything important is there and it's a thrilling ride!
So, afterwards, I read what reviewers on IMDB had to say about it.
To my surprise I find there have been some truly hateful reviews, bad mouthing the actors, the director and the script, but mostly to have a go at Disney.
All I can say is that these are either people who are serial critics (obviously nothing will please them) or they have a huge axe to grind with Disney.
Let me assure you. The Disney influence is minimal. There's no evil Disney brainwashing or manipulation of children's minds going on here.
That's just pure nonsense!
And let's be honest, if you really want to see a Disney influence, watch Star Wars Episode 1 - The Phantom Menace - the cutesy Anakin child, the annoying Jar Jar Binks etc.etc.
And that was long before Disney took over the franchise.
In actual fact, it appears to me that Disney is trying to keep a very low profile in their involvement with Star Wars. You don't see a single Disney logo anywhere or even the word 'Disney' until the very end of the titles.
It's still Lucasfilm Ltd.
People should stop looking for faults. Watch movies for what they are.
Enjoy the ride.
This is a delightful, thrilling cinematic adventure movie.
Storytelling at it's best.
I bought and watched this film on Blu-Ray as its well worth watching more than once.
Don't be put off by the critics.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
486,jeffyoung1,Not one of the best Star War entries,6,27 May 2018,"In the end it really doesn't matter. If you always go to Star Wars movies, you'll go to, SOLO: A STAR WARS STORY. Either way, the Hollywood studio makes it money whether you loved it or not. That's where I come to here. Perusing the reviews, it seems viewers either liked SOLO a lot or found it mediocre. I didn't see many haters. People either gave the movie a 9 or a 6, meaning, very good or, fair. Using the traditional Hollywood four star system, viewers gave SOLO either a 3 or 3.5 star rating, or they gave it a two star rating which means, fair, worth a look. That would be my rating, two stars. But of the last three Star Wars movies from 2015, I give three stars to all of them.
The movie was dark, literally speaking and it hurt my eyes that the lighting was so dark for most of the movie. I don't know what the director had in mind with such low set lighting. He even managed it for the ending desert beach scenes.
I didn't like this youthful Han Solo. He seemed to be a caricature, cartoonish character, always deceptively smiling throughout the movie. That was not the personality of the cynical, deadpan Han Solo from the first Star Wars movie. The young Han looked and talked so slippery that it was impossible to identify with him. I would have preferred the personality of the first Han Solo, who seldom smiled and you felt you could trust him and indeed want to be near him. Of the young Han, I'd stay a mile away from him. This is the first Star Wars movie where I feel little to no interest in purchasing the future DVD. If this movie was never made, it would have made no difference to me.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

The actor who played Hans Solo reminded me of Hayden Christensen - who played Anakin Skywalker in Stars Wars episode III. Alden Ehrenreich's acting is better, but he does not have the charisma of Harrison Ford to do his part at a younger age. I feel there would have been a better actor for that, as it was said, that person would have a hard time filling those shoes. I enjoyed the ride though as it deserves praise from all that were involved in its making and I look forward to the next.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
488,sheldonnylander,Star Wars Fatigue is Setting In,4,13 November 2019,"My, how the mighty have fallen! It used to be that Star Wars could do no wrong. People were even forgiving of the prequel trilogy (eventually) and its many, many flaws to accept them in the multi-billion dollar franchise. There was some trepidation over the whole ""Star Wars Story"" side story films, but that seemed to be allayed by the excellent ""Rogue One."" Then comes ""Solo,"" and I'm sorry to say that our fears have now been realized.Starting with Han growing up as a youth on Corellia, we see how each aspect of his character comes into being. Each. Aspect. Even how he gets the name Solo. I mean, seriously! They create a checklist, from his relationships to Chewie and Lando, right down to his blaster, and shows how each one comes to pass or be in his possession.It's actually kind of...well, sad. It turns out that every iconic aspect of this character we've loved all sprang out of one single caper in his career. Talk about peaking early! They even recreate some famous scenes, but they're still the same scenes just with a new coat of paint. And paint is a very apt metaphor. ""Solo"" is very much a paint by numbers Star Wars film. No surprises. Purely for fans, and even then there's some issues. Even the cameo at the end felt ridiculously overdone. Star Wars fatigue definitely seems to be setting in. Still, as a Star Wars fan, I'm probably being more forgiving even though I rate this movie as just ""Okay.""",Solo - A Star Wars Story

I don't like Han Solo as a character and saw this movie when it came out out of respect for Star Wars. This is a really good movie though. The visuals are great. The twists are great. The cameo near the end is amazing. Good cast. Villians are great. It is so sad to see this movie suffer so bad at the Box Office due to many Star Wars fans boycotting this film because of the (very well earned) failure of The Last Jedi film. This boycott changed the direction of Star Wars Spinoff films (which were headed in a great direction after Solo and Rogue One) and punished a great film.

I knew in my heart of hearts there was no way in HELL, Ron Howard would mess this up! He directed it greatly! They paid tribute to the old Star Wars films by finally doing one right! This was the best one by far out of the last 5. The actor that played SOLO, really captured all of Harrison's mannerisms and he did a stellar job.

493,GoldenBlunderbuss,"Given the production issues, a good addition to the increasingly overstuffed canon",7,25 July 2018,"Han Solo finds adventure when he joins a gang of galactic smugglers to settle debts to a dangerous gangster after a deal goes wrong.
It's no secret that the production of Solo: A Star Wars Story was a turbulent affair. Directors were fired, actors were threatened with dismissal and extensive reshoots with a new director put the film way over budget. To put it mildly, it's a miracle this film was made at all. It's an even greater miracle it turned out as good as it did!Alden Ehrenreich does an acceptable job filling Harrison Ford's shoes but all the way through the extensive run time, it's hard to plot how this upbeat and decidedly chirpy Han becomes the gruff and hateful pilot of the Millennium Falcon in A New Hope. The opposite is true of Donald Glover, who is immaculate as Lando Calrissian. His mannerisms, fluctuating eyebrows and voice inflections were so spot on to the Empire Strikes Back character that I still don't know if that's how Glover sounds normally or he's the best Billy Dee Williams impersonator this side of the Tatooine cantina.However, the film wastes strong female characters like I waste water on the second flush. You might've been excited to hear that Thandie Newton enters the Star Wars universe, but she leaves the film within 10 minutes of being introduced. On top of that, it pats itself on the back for introducing Lando's female droid who is constantly fighting for equal rights for robots (a less than subtle nod to the #metoo movement) but she barely gets the screen time deserving of a character so developed.Many scenes play to the audience in the only you can in Star Wars - show us old characters in new light, put a witty twist on an often-quoted line, or work with old tropes and we'll lap it up no questions asked. To that end, the final confrontation is a well-received and gratifying nod to the original 1977 release (and a giant middle finger to George Lucas) while a surprise cameo will throw up many questions from those unfamiliar with the extended universe. In short, Solo: A Star Wars Story left me wishing it could be a more rounded and neat experience like Rogue One but thankful it wasn't as cringe inducingly tacky as The Last Jedi.Best Quote: ""The Calrissian Chronicles.

Well, as it turned out the movie was just excellent. I'd say a 9 out of 10 for any fans of the originals... I'm giving it a 10 because, well, it deserves it for all the things it got right. Unlike one of the recent additions to the franchise, this movie paid true homage to us old fans while still delivering tons of action, excitement, and smiles for everybody. Well done, Ron Howard!I'm going with a spoilery review, I've got to in order to get it all of my chest.Random thoughts ahead:So I have a shirt with Han's pistol and the words ""Han shot first"". Yes he did... yes he did. ;) You have to see it, very well-timed, and it felt very true Han. Glover REALLY did Billy Dee Williams justice man, he sounded like him so much it was kinda scary. Loved it, loved his whole performance! Chewie, CHEWIE! Crazy intro, and nice scenes throughout. I could have done with a bit more something though, it felt like he never got the spotlight entirely. The other Wookie's head scratch scene was flipping great, my little reached around and messed up my hair for me right after. ;) Yeah Han, I feel your pain man!So many Easter eggs/nods and done so well... loved it! The Boba Fett-style suit at the rear of that scene stood out as a fun one.Is it pronounced ""Han"" or ""Hahn""? I loved how they handled that whole thing.Harrelson did a great job. Actually they all did great jobs, I believed every single part. None of the main characters were hokey, but while the main tone was serious it was always balanced by Ehrenreich's delivery. I'm really digging that guy's performance. Who the hell has the stones to step into that roll after Ford made it so iconic? Who could get it right while not just being a copy cat? Well, it has been done... never thought it was possible. D@#n good!Nothing was too predictable, and I appreciated it greatly as we all know what eventually was supposed to happen. Everything went though nicely, nothing struck me as ""Oh, that's totally not how it should have happened"", which I totally dig. The characters had a lot of depth and development, so despite being an action movie, you felt for all the main characters. The main baddie, oh wait, baddiES perfectly represented their criminal or otherwise evil selves. I loved the reveal for the main main heavy, boss of the boss... oh yeah, and that was cool of them to bring back the only character I or anyone liked from that particular movie. The first chase scene was nice, and the setup made me grin. Then for the 'Falcon and the Kessel Run, well that was just classic Solo wasn't it? It was done in how many parsecs? ""If you round down""... lol!One thing I just loved about this movie was that it felt so very Star Wars. 1,000,000 points to the design teams, thank you so much! Next to zero distracting CGI (the early trooper losing it had me worried, but he was the first and last out of place CGI). The high representation of non-human looking life was perfect. The droids were great. And the masks and costumes were just &**&ing spot on... well maybe not the weird pimp fur coats, but otherwise loved every bit of it!

Aesthetics and music blend effortlessly into the Star Wars universeLittle to do with Episodes, other than small glimpses of the Empire, with no Jedis in sightEnjoyable plot, but a little too busy and over-stuffed at timesDoesn't tie up story as neatly as Rogue One, but unanswered questions place it more solidly in the wider universe of Star WarsLacks a distinct personality, something original directors Lord and Miller could have achieved...Ehrenreich and Glover are exceptional as young versions of Han and Lando, evoking the original performances brilliantlyFinally we see more Chewie than in the last few filmsL3-37 is a throwaway droid and more should have been done with Beckett, but characters Qi'ra and Dryden Vos make up for it-------------------------------------------------------There's no denying how Star Wars came back with a vengeance after Disney bought it to add to their ever-expanding Empire (pun intended). Mostly, this has been a good thing for fans of series (especially if you liked The Last Jedi, the Episode that split fans massively). Many have welcomed the idea of prequels and spin-offs, eager for the chance to explore characters' pasts and aspects of the galaxy far, far away that we've never seen before. The first of their Star Wars Story anthology, Rogue One, worked well, many saying it seemed refreshing to see this universe outside the confines of the Jedi-dominated episodes. It still proves to be an exciting idea with Solo: A Star Wars Story, although it does still leave a little more to be desired. Still, there's no denying how enjoyable the film is nevertheless.While this is clearly Star Wars, there's very little other than characters that connect it to the universe we know. There's not a great deal of the Empire, let alone the rebellion or Jedi. This could almost be a standalone sci-fi film if it weren't for the typically Star Wars-esque aesthetic and music - and the characters, of course. This allows Solo to feel less burdened and hindered by the other films, free to do as it pleases. For the most part, its plot is solid and enjoyable. At its heart, it's a MacGuffin film that desperately includes the famously-mentioned Kessel Run, pleasing science geeks everywhere by making clear that parsec is a unit of distance, not time. Still, sometimes they try to fit a little too much into the story and it feels quite busy. The time spent of Kessel in particular felt very crammed and manic; you're not sure what they're trying to focus on... Then during the Kessel Run itself they're running from one thing to the next to the next... On one hand it's a non-stop, thrillingly wild ride - but on the other, it's exhausting and too busy, not giving you a chance to breathe and take in what's going on. Whereas non-stop action works with Mad Max: Fury Road, there's not nearly as much plot-points stuffed in there. The story also seems to open up a lot of questions that are left unanswered. It's a shame it doesn't tie it up neatly as Rogue One, but still keeps it interesting and is a joy to see it reference and place itself firmly in the wider universe of the franchise. One surprising inclusion of a fan-favourite character is certainly exciting as is the obvious cameo by regular Warwick Davis. Here's hoping that there's a common thread in these Star Wars Stories so we're not left with unanswered questions for long.If there is to be a common thread isn't these spin-off films though, it's still important that they give each film a unique feel and personality, something that Solo lacks. For example, Rogue One had a distinct feel and personality in that it was absolutely a war film. On the other hand, Solo could have been unique with a swashbuckling adventure feel - something original directors Lord and Miller would have excelled at before Ron Howard took over... Not that that tone is completely absent, but it lacks a distinct personality. Still, it's fun and fits into the overall feel of a Star Wars film; it's just a shame that there's nothing that feels special of different about it. It certainly is enjoyable to see the Star Wars aesthetics blend in so well, opening up the galaxy for us to explore. Powell's music is a perfect extension of John William's iconic scores too.There was a lot of worry as to how well the lead actor would cope with playing a younger version of an iconic cinematic character. Fortunately, Alden Ehrenreich does a terrific job, brilliantly evoking a young Harrison Ford from handsome looks with floppy hair to drooly, cocky voice. He's not a dead ringer for Ford, but he's not doing an impression. They're merely recreated the look and he bases his performance off the original with an impressive result. The same can be said for Donald Glover's young Lando, who's arguably even better than Ehrenreich, absolutely nailing that charming, treacly voice. It's nice to see the two of them meet after seeing them in Empire Strikes Back, but more Lando is needed. Their relationship in Empire Strikes Back seems much deeper, filled with more history. Solo would have benefitted from more Lando with better chemistry and a stronger bromance between the two. Instead most of the bromance is with Han and Chewie, a remarkably pleasing member of the cast, who is finally given the screen-time he deserves after being painfully underused in The Force Awakens and The Last Jedi.The new droid L3-37 is really a throwaway droid who's ultimately unnecessary. Clearly the studio want another K-2SO to steal scenes like he did in Rogue One, but she doesn't make the same impression, though certainly still gets her fair share of laughs. Woody Harrelson's character seems like a strange one for Han to be inspired by. Not nearly as suave and cool as Han grows to be, Beckett is a missed opportunity, who should have done more than just swirl his guns and look cool. Emilia Clarke ditches her blond wig from Game of Thrones and embraces the typical Star Wars look for all female characters in the series - pale, brunette and beautiful. Why are they all the same? Still Clarke is wonderful, making Qi'ra interesting, enigmatic and effortlessly likeable. A joy to see her dazzle audiences outside Westeros. Finally Paul Bettany moves from superhero in Marvel to villain in Star Wars (Disney must be loving him). As with most English villains (because apparently that accent works for bad guys...), he's sincere and threatening, though isn't quite the powerful adversary Han deserves for his origin story.Solo: A Star Wars Story didn't perform as well at the box office as predicted - but who could after Avengers: Infinity War (with Deadpool 2 sliding in soon after)? That doesn't correlate to the strength and quality of the film however. This is no Empire Strikes Back or Force Awakens, nor does it have a distinct personality like Rogue One; and yes, maybe this is just Disney trying to squeeze as much as possible from the Star Wars universe. But when it's this fun, does it really matter? It's an undeniable joy seeing younger, fresh-faced versions of these characters we love from the original films soar onto our screens for a fun adventure, albeit a busy one with a little too much crammed in. Nevertheless, this is still light, easy-going and enjoyable. Nothing sets it apart, but it's a solid adventure in a galaxy far, far away that will keep us happy until Episode IX...",Solo - A Star Wars Story

(6/10)""Solo"" is a movie that has an aggressively slow pace and does not solve much except a few minor things about Han.
The movie has very low stakes compared to all the other Star Wars' and that is understandable, but coming off the success of the first spinoff ""Rouge One"" it's just not that enjoyable. The Han Solo ""origin"" feature, is smoothly directed by Ron Howard and smoothly written by Lawrence Kasdan. The supporting cast is great, but Ehrenreich just can't capture Harrison Ford's Han Solo, and that was a little bit of a turn off for me.
Ehrenreich he obviously studied Harrison Ford's wise-ass cadences and arrogant, gunslinger stride. Still he can't capture the charm. The movie is not great, because the title character isn't the best part of the film. That honor belongs to Donald Glover's Lando and Woody Harrelson's Beckett. These two really keep the movie going and keep it from being a boring space adventure.
I don't care to see any more of Han's origin, and this story strongly hints at sequels. The movie fell flat on its face due to the firing of directors and the reports of poor acting by Ehrenreich, I personal did not see a problem, but it is hard to play a character that already has such a legacy.

Would you rewatch it? No but would you say it's tereible? No.
Can you get motivated about sequel? No.
A shame as it's a good flick but leaves you a little frustrated at the end.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
508,fjk1138-731-161881,It's OK for what it is,6,28 September 2018,"After finally seeing this, I can say while it wasn't great it wasn't horrible either. Overall, I believe Ron Howard did an OK job with what was probably given to him (aka an expensive mess to sort out), but there were plenty of scenes that stood out better than others (train robbery, Solo's early military scenes). I've read that up to 80% of this movie was reshot, so if that is true, then I would like to have seen some alternate takes to see what was tossed out from the final edit.So long as you can accept that Alden is not Harrison you'll do fine, though I have to give Alden credit for at least trying to play the part sincerely and no doubt being fully aware of all the fallout that has occurred as a result of him being in this movie.What the movie suffers from the most are the fact that scenes play out too fast and/or so matter of factly without even really trying to build any tension or suspense. For example, instead of building tension during the card game for the Falcon, it pretty much is all smiles and just kind of goes by and whelp...that's that. The best parts to me were the Han and Chewy interactions, but they seem to bond rather quickly in the movie and never struggle with getting along beyond the first few minutes of their initial time together. The plot was pretty predictable overall, with almost no twists and turns. The ""real"" villain in the movie only has a couple of scenes and didn't seem that interested in his own part. I could go on, but you get the idea.The surprise near the end with Darth Maul was odd and really kind of pointless. He's basically there to ignite his saber (which is the closest you'll get to Jedi action in this one) so all I can say about that is to quote the Stormtroopers would say ""Move Along, move along..."".
At the end of the day, I hope that Disney slows things down a bit with these movies and realizes that cash in attempts disguised as cheap fan service can be spotted a mile away.

509,homdeb1058,I Liked It as A Star Wars Universe Movie,8,25 May 2018,"I thought it was a actually good movie-- probably more likable to me than Rogue One. Good visuals, likable characters, decently paced action, good story that fit fairly well into what we know about Han's past. The problem for me was: it wasn't Han Solo. The new Han want-a-be was too cheerful, too friendly too short, too high voiced. If I was going to do a Han Solo movie I would scour the universe for Harrison Ford look alikes and then cull those for the closest to that deep voice and signature scowl. It was the right universe, just not the right guy to convince me we were seeing the young Han Solo. If Star Trek could find seven young actors who look, act, sound, and have creepily similar mannerisms to the old crew, couldn't these guys manage one Han Solo?) I give it an 8/10 for a decent Star Wars story. Nothing for a believable Solo.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
510,odaleg,Not the right way,6,29 May 2018,"The most bland and lack of personality movie of the entire Star Wars universe, over episode I. Take everything that has worked in the rest of the saga and use mediocre characterization of the villain.
Han Solo is not Han Solo, he is a man who makes jokes and knows how to talk shyriiwook but who has the charisma that this character had in the other deliveries. Luckily, there are Lando Calrissian, L3-37 and Qi'ra to bring the charisma that the protagonist lacks. The script tries to be fun and serious at the same time and that is not a good idea, since it is halfway between both themes. It also uses many resources already used and gives the feeling of ""this I've seen.""

513,alex-frey-pattaya,Surprisingly Accurate and Entertaining,9,25 May 2018,"I went to a special screening 1 day before the release, the movie was almost empty which is why I am not surprised about some reviews here who clearly haven't seen the movie. I too had my doubts that they would be able to make such an iconic character work with a different actor. I was afraid that the cast was too distracting from the story. It was a great movie that turned out to be in no way as chronical that most people were afraid of. Ron Howard did a great job by telling a story for non Star Wars Freaks and engage all the nerds and freaks who are very familiar with the lore and the Clone Wars Series and Rebels Series by dropping Easter eggs all over the place. 
Han Solo was always the character for comical relief therefore it is a funny movie with great action scenes, amazing animatronics and a decent story.If real Star Wars fans can't appreciate the first meeting of future allies in the original movies what does make them happy?",Solo - A Star Wars Story
514,vandykeu,It's better than the new trilogy,7,27 May 2018,"I liked Solo.... much more than I anticipated I would. Like many people posting reviews, I am an old-school, die-hard fan of the original trilogy, and I am also a fan of the old ""extended universe"", much of which is now being overshadowed by the cash-grab that is this new Disney-driven galaxy.However, I must say that the negativity this film has received is undeserved. The story is solid, if a bit predictable at times. The dialogue and acting are FAR better than in any of the other recent Star Wars films, except perhaps Rogue One. Notably in comparison to Last Jedi, the story has a logical flow, there are no side-stories that make no sense, nor any ham-handed attempts to milk humor out of an unrealistic scene. I can't say it enough, this movie actually makes sense and has a believable story.If there is a problem, it is that Star Wars is becoming another Marvel Universe, where everything has already been done in one way or another. For non-star wars fans, this will be a perfectly serviceable action/sci-fi adventure, with characters whose struggles most people should recognize from other stories in these genres. I was pleasantly surprised at how some characters were killed- it actually made me worry that anyone could be in danger, even knowing that this was impossible. It was emotionally real.For Star Wars fans, there are heaps of references to the extended universe. These were done in a way that made sense and gave service to old Star Wars stories. Teras Kasi, Aurra Sing, Chewy being ~200 years old, among others. There are glimpses at what the every day life of an average citizen in the empire would experience (spoiler: not nice). Han as a character is played true to form: a guy who has seen some bad things, done some bad things, but still, deep down, is good.I liked it.

I haven't watched Last Jedi yet but SOLO is the best of the bunch so far.It's a nicely paced film which kept it entertaining.Han Solo, Chewy, Woody Harrelson's Beckett, Thandie Newton's Val and Rio Durant stood out, were good fun to watch and they all carried the film really well.SOLO is a very simple origin story, don't go in expecting depth because it's all on the surface.I was enjoying the tone, characters, performances, action and pace of the film up until Lando Calrissian, L-3 and Han's girlfriend Qi'ra started getting more of the screen-time, pushing Woody Harrelson's cool, serious but funny Beckett into the sidelines which was a mistake! Even Han Solo took a back seat for a few minutes to accentuate Lando and L-3. That pair ruined the cool tone of the film that was established by all the previous characters.Lando felt like his coolness was forced and ended up cringey. He even gets an introduction of how cool he's meant to be by Qi'ra, it was embarrassing and unnecessary.L-3 felt like she belonged in a kids film and was annoyingly so out of place in this.Emilia Clarke as Qi'ra, very unconvincing performance and cringey also.I was shocked by the performance of the marauder character called Enfys Nest, OH WOW, i don't think i've ever seen such an amateur/emotionless performance by anyone in such a blockbuster before, it was like they'd just dragged someone off the street with no interest in acting and it showed!Those four actors/characters really took me out of what was a decently toned film when they appeared. It would have been better if they had kept Thandie Newton's Val and Rio Durant throughout the film, instead of shoehorning Lando, L-3 and Qi'ra into the team/mission. Val and Rio had chemistry with the main cast and felt like they belonged in this world.TBH even if they switched those characters it would still only get 7/10 max anyway(which is actually pretty good) because as an overall film it wasn't stretched to its full potential story wise.Not really a film you need to watch at the cinema..unless you're a Star Wars fan that has enjoyed the past 3 movies!",Solo - A Star Wars Story

It's an aspect of the star wars series that's taken out of context to give some back-drop, so watch it or don't, but to me, it was a fun film.I like the Han Solo character, because I felt he had some personality and confidence. He's smart. I also felt he did a good acting job.I read some of the complaints by others and I have to say it seems there's a lot of people here who think they can write and direct a film better than Ron Howard. Overall, the writing in this movie isn't super, but that's in relation to the series on the whole. In terms of a stand-alone film, this movie gives a little insight and to me it was entertaining. Aren't movies supposed to be fun?I suppose your level of enjoyment will depend upon how much of a Star Wars fan you are. I'm only in it to watch every film from start to finish (chronologically) and see how the movies all tie in to one-another and ultimately how they come together.If after viewing all films (and watching some of them more than once), I may come back and edit this review.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
519,passenger70,An actual Star Wars movie.,7,31 May 2018,The original movie was a crazy seat-of-the-pants adventure story where the heroes winged it until they eventually won the day. Guess what? So is this. It isn't a galactic drama but a fun time at the cinema. Despite some last minute attempts to shoehorn in some Marvel-style nods to future instalments it is mostly a light hearted romp. Maybe people don't wanna see a Star Wars without lightsabers but for me it was always about the Millennium Falcon. I enjoyed it.,Solo - A Star Wars Story
520,martinmcdonough,Surprisingly entertaining,8,21 June 2018,"I have to admit that I went into seeing this movie with not the highest of expectations. I'd heard alot about the movie - both good and bad - and wanted to wait for the dust to settle so I could see it in a non-crowded theater so my opinion wouldn't be swayed by audience reactions. It's not that bad. In fact, it's very entertaining.I think the problem with the negative reviews stem from the fact that Star Wars has become an industry unto itself and that, somehow, the original trilogy has been elevated to the level of Citizen Kane or The Godfather. Remember, the original trilogy (episodes 4-6) - when originally released two score ago - were enjoyable movies but were not and will never be compared to Shakespeare and the cast wasn't plucked from The Mercury Theater Players. But they were just good, fun, enjoyable movies.Which is exactly what Solo is.Seeing that no one can be what Harrison Ford was as Han Solo, I wanted to give Alden Ehrenreich a chance to play the part because if I hadn't then there's no point in seeing the movie. After the opening ""car chase"" as it were, especially the fake thermal detonator bit, I was sold on him. He had enough smarmy-ness to be funny and believable, but he didn't go too far to be annoying - which was perfect.I liked how he talked his way into Woody Harrelson's smuggling crew to get his first gig, and the attempted heist of the train car was pretty entertaining as well. You get an idea of how Han learns his negotiating skills when they make the bargain with Dryden Vos, and Donald Glover was spot on as a young Lando. And, yes, the answer to the question of how Han wins the Falcon from Lando is answered. The only part of the movie I didn't understand was how could Darth Maul have been Vos's boss? The timeline didn't seem to fit from when a young Obi-Wan ginsu'd him in the first prequel. However, a friend of mine who knows all things Star Wars advised that it was possible based on the Disney cartoon series. Okay, that's fine for those that follow the minutiae of this galaxy, but for the casual observer (i.e. the movies) it didn't make sense.Is it a good movie? Yes. Sure it its. Is it worth watching? Absolutely. Is it a fun and entertaining ride? Yes. That's really all you can - and should - ask for from a Star Wars movie.

And after reading the ""adventures"" of the previous directors.But quite frankly, I was surprised. First, not a origin story but an standalone 2-hours episode. It was fun & full of action. The main actor -Alden Ehrenreich- is sometimes bland but did the job right. Emilia Clarke's character is cute but you don't see any close connection with Solo.

523,darryl-42069,A potentially good heist movie ruined by horrible pacing.,6,2 June 2018,"*WARNING! MILD SPOILERS AHEAD*So far, I enjoyed all of Disney's Star Wars movies. TFA is a great movie, TLJ is a pretty good, but admittedly a divisive movie, and Rogue One is very enjoyable to watch (keep in mind that I haven't watched SW Episode 1-6, but I do know some of the characters and their backgrounds).Solo, however, is a misfire. It's not a bad movie overall, but rather a forgettable one.Pros:CastAlden Ehrenreich does a good job as Han Solo, he totally fits the role. Emilia Clarke did a good job as Qi'ra. Donald Glover did a fantastic job as Lando Calrissian, and has the best performance among the cast. Woody Harrelson and Paul Bettany are great as Beckett and Dryden, but were totally wasted in this movie (I'll explain later). Jon Faverau did a brief but good job as Rio. Lastly, Thandie Newton did a good job as Val.PlotlineThe best thing about the story is how the movie is centered around Han Solo and his first adventures with Chewbacca. I love how Han and Chewie first met and their interaction is great to look at. I also love the chemistry between Han and Qi'ra. The interaction between Han and Beckett (Woody Harrelson) is also nice.CGIThe CGI is, as always a feast to the eyes, though there are a couple shots that looked unrealistic.Cons:CharactersThe characters in this movie, however, have little development, as the result I don't really care anyone in this movie (except Lando, he's cool). Han Solo being Han Solo, nothing was added to his personality. Qi'ra is a great character, but greatly underutilized. Lando is great, but like Qi'ra, he could have done so much more. Beckett is... just there, nothing interesting other than he didn't trust anyone. Dryden is a stereotypical 1D villain who's evil, threatening, but no depth. Lastly, L3, played by Phobe Waller-Bridge is not a good droid character. She's super annoying with her ""robot-rights"" rant.PacingThis is where the movie suffers. The movie is so inconsistent with what they're trying to do. On one point is a fun, fast paced heist movie, but later shifts to a slower, more serious movie. The 3rd act really suffers because of this, and it ends up anticlimactic, and boring. At one point I was into it, but then the movie screeched to a halt and I let out a couple of yawns at that point. It's that inconsistent.StoryThe story didn't add anything new to the Star Wars lore, nor it adds to the main story. So even if you didn't watch this movie you'll be fine. There's nothing to worry about missing a plot detail in the original-prequel trilogies.ActionSurprisingly, there's not much action scenes in this movie. But when they do happen, it's pretty fun. The problem is that there's no wow factor in it. There's nothing mind-blowing about it, there's nothing that makes me jump in excitement, it's just fun, but only surface level of fun, with no lasting impact.Overall, I'm pretty disappointed with Solo. It's not a bad movie, it's just very forgettable. I honestly felt that it could be better, it could be fun, but the pacing killed it for me. For casual moviegoers like me, you can watch this movie and have fun with it, but for Star Wars fans, I do feel that you'll be disappointed with this movie.Final Score: 6/10PS: Also, whoever's working at the Indonesian censorship department that edits this movie should be fired. I mean really? Censoring a kiss?! Twice?!!! And even the cuts were badly edited. Indonesian censorship in a nutshell indeed. -_-",Solo - A Star Wars Story
524,qiu_xinzhi,"A joy-filled, yet pointless adventure",6,2 June 2018,"This is a film no one asked for, and no one needed. It was a story about a young Han Solo, and how he became what we knew him to be in Episode 4. This film was definitely unnecessary and inconsequential, but it was an exciting and joyful ride all the same. It captures the essence of heist films and brings a different level of Star Wars as what we know and love. Alden Ehrenreich did alright as Han Solo, bringing the charisma and the wit of the character, but seemingly lacks the ""X""-Factor of Harrison Ford's version. Emilia Clarke delivered a Qi'ra that was very complex and unpredictable that could be one of the best characters in this film. Donald Glover appeared as Lando Calrissian and nailed the role, giving us a Lando more Lando than the one played by Billy Dee Williams so many years ago. Woody Harrelson as Tobias Beckett was about what you expect a mentor to be, yet filled with so much unpredictability. Plot-wise, this film is generic to the heist genre, with little hints of the Star Wars adventure. In fact, it was so generic that it could be passed of as a heist movie set in space. It was predictable for most of the first 2 acts, although twists and turns in the last act was appreciated.However, as mentioned earlier, this adventure feels a bit pointless and never brings us anywhere. It felt like the lowest-stake Star Wars film in recent memory and didn't bring anything new to the table, both in terms of style or substance. I appreciate the attempt by the anthology series to be in a different style from the main trilogy, with Rogue One being a was film (and an amazing one at that), and Solo being a heist film, but being set in the Star Wars universe, I was definitely expecting a heist film that was more different from so many others before it. Perhaps, I might have appreciated it more if not for the social justice forced in from the character L3-37 (nothing bad about it, just felt pointless) and believed that it should have been made as a solo adventure, instead of building up towards a sequel (which we may never get).",Solo - A Star Wars Story

It hits the Star Wars tones - with visuals, sound, music, and a mix of pop corny action and humor. On my second viewing, Alden Ehrenreich grasped me more as a young Han, less so for physical appearance and mannerisms than for his less cynical bravado. An early scene of a land attack by empire soldiers that he joins up with reminds of what Star Wars is - an intergalactic military conflict amidst merchants, smugglers, victims, and genuine tradesmen trying to survive. It's passable, but unfortunately somewhat forgettable.

Back to the movie, the opening minutes aren't great, but, then it really picks up, great performances all around and espcially Alden Ehrenreich, who manages to capture the essence of Harrison Ford's iconic Han Solo.
It is deserving of a sequel and I recall talking to many other Star Wars fans at Disney Hollywood Studios while waiting for the Star Wars Fireworks to start and they felt the same and the cheers when Ehrenreich's Solo makes an appearance during the fireworks proves that and the gap between the end of the Solo movie and Han's first appearance in the original Star Wars movie contains a lot of scope to do that.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
530,moonbus69,Not Your Daddy's 'Star Wars'....,9,10 June 2018,"With so much negative & toxic chatter on the Net about ""Solo"", I debated for a long while about seeing this film. But a good friend (and big Star Wars fan) said he enjoyed it, so I took the plunge (June 9).
 Star Wars is such a rich and wonderfully realized 'universe'... so many species, aliens, creatures, planets, spaceships, technology, etc... and 'Solo' had these - in spades (to use a card-playing term). Don't get why so many knock this film (and The Last Jedi), but it was much less serious and a lot more fun than ALL the newer SW films that have been made since 1983, when ROTJ came out...
 All-in-all, I had one helluva good time watching this film. I wasn't expecting the actor taking on such an iconic role as Han Solo to be 'perfect', but he did an excellent job playing a much younger Han... He had much of Harrison Ford's voice 'timbre' (sound quality), and did the 'wink' and other facial ticks that Ford had imbued his original portrayal with. So... if YOU just WANT a FUN Star Wars movie, this is it! ...and May the Farce be with You! ;-)",Solo - A Star Wars Story
531,marcusman48,A good effort,6,18 June 2018,"I walked into SOLO cautiously optimistic, knowing that it would at least be better than THE LAST JEDI; afterward, I realized that I should have been even more optimistic. SOLO is about as good a STAR WARS movie as you could ask for these days - in fact, what I think is the best SW film since RETURN OF THE JEDI! I had a good time, and my faith was renewed in the franchise.Which is remarkable, seeing that I was raised on the STAR WARS Expanded Universe of the 1990s and was a big fan of the Han Solo series of novels by Brian Daley and AC Crispin by Bantam Books, which this film contradicts on a number of important points. I've learned to mentally screen out the details invented by Disney that I don't like and immerse myself in the experience of entertainment as a whole. And SOLO is a terrific entertainment!The best thing I can say about SOLO is that it has a ""classic"" feel to it that the prequels and even the sequels are lacking. Very little cheesy CGI and even less pomposity, hewing to the spirit of the 1977-1983 installments. But there are plenty more things to praise. Plenty of new characters to get to know, great sets to look at (Han's hometown of Coronet on the planet Corellia reminds me a bit of the Gotham City in Tim Burton's BATMAN), thrilling and suspenseful action sequences...and then there is a serious contender for the most awe-inspiring shot in all of STAR WARS history: Han and the crew of the Millennium Falcon, blasting off from the prison planet Kessel, forced to confront what looks like the most gargantuan Imperial Star Destroyer ever, breaking through the gloomy clouds of the night sky! It would have terrified ME, that's for sure!Even in places where the movie could have made serious missteps, it came through smelling like a rose. I especially appreciate the filmmaker's successful resistance of the temptation to slip in ""clever"" innuendoes to famous but irrelevant characters like Darth Vader (although one scene taking place on Corellia subtly evokes him). There are also deft nods to semi-obscure elements of the Expanded Universe for longtime aficionados like me, such as ""teras kasi"" (look it up, friends). Even the supporting characters are not annoying for once: one of my favorites was a four-armed alien named Rio, resembling a friendly, anthropomorphic organ grinder's monkey and reminding me a lot of Rocket Raccoon from Marvel's GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY.So why am I giving this film a 6 instead of a 7 or 8? Well, there ARE a few touches I was not happy with, such as the casting of Woody Harrelson, who I thought was out of place. But in general, SOLO disappointed me not with what it included, but with what it did NOT include. Thankfully there was none of the Jedi-versus-Sith mumbo jumbo that seems to have totally taken over the baseline films; but also lacking were the serial-style touches I remember from the original trilogy, which would have fit right in here. No ""monster attacks,"" too few weird aliens, and the conspicuous absence of beloved characters who really should have been present. Jabba the Hutt, whom we haven't seen on the big screen since 1999's THE PHANTOM MENACE, is nowhere to be found (though he IS mentioned elliptically at the very end); and, given the storied history he has had with Solo and his allies over the years, the bounty hunter Boba Fett's absence is also a shame. By way of compensation, they did slip in some gangster characters (not Hutts, unfortunately) and even some innuendoes about the Black Sun crime organization from the novel/comic book/video game SHADOWS OF THE EMPIRE (although here it's called ""Crimson Dawn""). There's even a surprise cameo by one of the most memorable villains in the history of the franchise (not Vader, but you won't be disappointed).SOLO was stellar, and I really wish I could recommend it more. As things stand, it's a hopeful sign. I've been counting on Disney to save the STAR WARS franchise, and they've taken a small step in the right direction.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

533,jezfernandez,A solid entry to the franchise,8,27 January 2019,"The problem with Star Wars is that it's a victim of its own success. Notice how many reviewers state their own relationship to it by way of introduction (e.g. ""I'm a huge fan and loved the originals...""). That's a shame, because how you feel about the series is largely irrelevant to a side prequel like Solo. Furthermore, the fandom around the character of Han Solo is, to my mind, somewhat overblown. Was Harrison Ford's incarnation a great character? Yes, but then they all were. The charm of Star Wars is in its loveable ensemble (even down to a droid that only beeps). Solo was a great character, but no so toweringly that a prequel could only work with Ford back in the drainpipe navy trousers.This particular backstory has of course been retro-fitted, based on elements hinted at in the original trilogy. So here, we discover just exactly what went down in that Kessel run and Solo won the Millennium Falcon 'fair and square' from Lando. Some of the action sequences are absolutely knockout, like the snowy mountain train car heist or the nail-biting Kessel run (complete with a giant squid monster and troublesome black hole).Alden Ehrenreich does well in the titular role, especially considering Ford's performance in Episode IV was pretty dire. Woody Harrelson and Donald Glover make likeable companions, both of whom are as largely self-serving as Solo himself.Problems? Solo's chemistry with Emilia Clarke's Qi'ra fails to convince, especially in the earlier scenes. Clark, in fact, is so quintessentially British that her 'dark side' is a very tough sell. Lando's sidekick L3 is an embarrassment that makes no sense. Think of a droid with permanent PMT and you'll get the idea. The final act is big anti-climax and at least 15 minutes could have been shaved off the running time.Ron Howard is often criticised for being a 'steady hand' (read 'bland'), but Solo totally rocks in a good number of parts. The plot is coherent and authentic and, much like the Falcon's escape pod, Howard jettisons pointless side plots (don't worry, I'm not going to mention that casino in The Last Jedi...).Overall, this is a solid actioner with good characterisation, lashings of well-placed humour and fantastic effects. After Rogue One, 'Star Wars stories' have yet to disappoint.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
534,eden-rabatsch,Traditional storytelling doesn't allow the film to fire,6,28 May 2018,This is a Schrodinger's film - both simultaneously good and bad.A simple test is this: when you watched The Last Crusade and in 4 minutes every part of Indy's lore was explained did you get almost to the point of a stroke angry or enjoyed it? If the latter then Solo will be alive for you.I did that rare trick for me - I enjoyed the film while watching it. I ignored each cinematic sin but afterwards they rushed in and they were ominously large.The cast is surprisingly good apart from Emilia Clarke who looks lost the entire film. Ehrenreich is done no favours with a horrific opening act but by the end of the film has got Ford's jauntiness down. Glover steals the scenery as expected but it might be Harrelson who does the most effective work bridging the film from scene to scene.I could list all the issues but I will sum it up here: this was the chance to show why Han Solo is the cynical smuggler we meet in A New Hope and that is not achieved here. That was storytelling 101 and if you can't do that then the other travesties including that infamous naming scene are to be expected.I can only think that The Last Jedi reaction informed just how conservative this film is...almost two hours of fan service. Beware what fandom sometimes asks for.....,Solo - A Star Wars Story
535,nadblaster,"Better than I expected, but not perfect",7,17 January 2019,"Full disclosure: I thought The Last Jedi was the worst movie in years, and easily the worst Star Wars movie ever made. That said, Solo is a fun, inoffensive story that is light on the Jedi hand-wringing and heavy on the action, and that is exactly what Disney's Star Wars needed.The actors, every last one, did a really great job. I might be Harrison Ford's biggest fan and didn't know what to expect from Alden Ehrenreich, and I think he did absolutely fantastic here. The writers didn't, but that's not the actors' faults, and I was very pleased to see in Emillia Clarke that Disney is in fact capable of finding a female lead that is actually likable. The writing is in my opinion a little sub-par, and turns Han Solo from a rough-and-tumble rapscallion who takes it where he can get it into a heart-of-gold victim of society. Solo makes a lot of weird little mistakes (Lando's droid is absolutely insufferably cringeworthy and almost made me turn the movie off) but I forgive it for three reasons:1: There is a scene that takes place on Kessel which sucks. The immediate scene afterwards is outstanding and is easily one of my favourite Star Wars moments ever.
2: It is better than The Last Jedi by several orders of magnitude. Then again, a round of chemotherapy is better than TLJ, but my point stands.
3: It still has a weird social justice underpinning, but at least it goes precisely one hour before it starts beating you over the head with it.Other than that, aside from a pretty unsatisfying ending (the penultimate story twist is just so stupid) I enjoyed this movie, and after TLJ I honestly thought I wouldn't ever enjoy Star Wars movies again. Props to Ron Howard and all the actors, because if they can get a couple more movies like this out Star Wars might be cool again one day.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
536,darcywinchester,"A good action movie, but not Han Solo",6,29 July 2018,"I went to see this film with my family at the Picturehouse Bradford IMAX cinema in 3D.In this Ron Howard (A Beautiful Mind, Apollo 13) directed movie, written by Jonathan Kasdan (The First Time, TVs Californication), Lawrence Kasdan (The Big Chill, The Bodyguard) based on characters created by George Lucas (Raiders of the Lost Ark, American Grafitti), Alden Ehrenreich (Beautiful Creatures, Tetro) stars as Han Solo, an orphan who escapes from Corellia accidentally leaving his girlfriend Qi-ra (Emilia Clarke) behind.Later, after being kicked out of the Imperial Flight Academy for insubordination, when fighting on the planet Mimban as an Imperial infantryman, Han sees three theives posing as fighters, Tobias Beckett (Woody Harrelson), girlfriend Val (Thandie Newton) and alien Rio Durant (voiced by Jon Favreau) and tries to join them. Refusing at first, and getting him captured and thrown into a pit to be eaten by the beast, Han befriends the beast, his future friend and copilot wookie Chebacca (voiced by Joonas Suotamo: ) and works with him to escape, catching the gang as they leave on a stolen ship. Letting them come along, due to Chewie's muscle, they agree they can join them on their plan to rob a train of coaxium. The heist goes wrong and they have to go to explain themselves to leader of Crimson Dawn, criminal Dryden Vos (Paul Bettany).Han is surprised to learn that Qi'ra works for Vos and she accompanies them to a card game with smuggler Lando Calrissian (Donald Glover) who Han tries to win a vessel from, but Lando cheats. How will they complete their mission to get to the planet Kessel and steal some unprocessed coaxium?Having grown up in the right era, I am a Star Wars fan and I have enjoyed the latest ones up to now, but I have to say, this one disappointed. Yes, it is a good action movie, but Han did not seem like the right character given what we all knows comes after and in parts, it seemed like an exercise in ticking boxes: Han meets Chewie, meets Lando, pilots the Millenium Falcon etc. etc. with aliens, shootouts and double-crossings. For me, it did not add anything to the Star Wars universe and unless they are setting up the Qi'ra character as a baddie in a forthcoming movie, I am not sure it was needed.The acting was good, Bettany and Harrelson in particular, but the plot was predictable and it certainly did not need to be seen in 3D (which is a shame because I don't often see films in this format). The robot L3 gave us some comic relief, though the 'robots as slaves' did feel like the makers giving it an unsubtle politicised theme.I don't think it was just a case of Han Solo can only be Harrison Ford, I think it is more of a case of Han Solo was not Han Solo in this film and that might be why I felt let down.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

Disney, apparently, cannot make a movie anymore without clubbing its audience over the head with political themes.The lead's attempt to adopt Ford's mannerisms is laudable, but his delivery just doesn't cut it.
Clarke is atrocious as usual, how she's popular is beyond me.Story is meh. It's your regular, undaring, run of the mill action flick. It's depressing to think how much money and talent went into making this uninspiring cash grab.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

Episode 7 was kind of ok for me bc it set up the new game with old characters and new ones, the ending was one of the best endings in film history, it had so much potential. I expected to see all that potential in Last Jedi and the movie didn't deliver. Since then, I fell out of love with the Star wars universe. I decided to stick with the original stuff, pre Disney, and that's it. That's why I didn't go to the movies to see Solo. Han Solo is definitely a favorite, and I didn't want to see him destroyed like they did to Luke. So I watched it on a plane, once I had to take a long flight and it was in the movie menu. I have to say it wasn't that bad. It's closer to Rogue One that to Last Jedi. The guy who plays Solo you can tell made a LOT of effort to learn his demeanor and mannerisms, and that's appreciated. It's watchable. It does feel like the Star wars universe and it's actually fun and entertaining.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

545,Snownoise,The Last Jedi killed Solo and the franchise,7,20 September 2018,"This is the first time I didn't see the Star Wars movie series in the theater for decades ever since I watched the movie, The Last Jedi. The last Jedi was a pure mass solely created for raking money by the producers. With J.J. Abrams' Force awakens backing up, they knew they would make a lot of money even if they made a sequel as bad as they could and they weren't wrong. But then many of the fans including me noticed that lousy skim too and then decided not to go to see whatever the new movies of Star Wars released in the future. So that's what happened to Solo even though the movie isn't really bad. It's definitely much better movie than The Last Jedi. It's not as boring as The Last Jedi. It's not as flawed as The Last Jedi. It's simply a very interesting movie and Ron Howard did a good job. All the characters worked together very well too. Woody Harrelson, Thandie Newton, and Paul Bettany were nice addition. The only problem I had was that Donald Glover as Lando didn't really work well. It's simply because the original Lando has much more muscular build, and Donald Glover wasn't really fit into that. Overall, it's a nice and enjoyable movie. However, again, I'll never watch Star Wars movies in the theater any more.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
546,russmillerwy-957-682439,Better and much less predictable than I was expecting,9,2 June 2018,"One of my favorite recent Star Wars movies alongside Rogue One. It has one of the strongest casts, including the most major female characters ever in a Star Wars film. Donald Glover is a complete natural as Lando Calrissian, worthy of his own sequel. Emilia Clarke is alluring and mysterious as a heroine who may or may not also be a femme fatale. New Chewie is every bit as great as old Chewie. Thankfully, most of these actors can do comedy. That's what was once so terrible about Lucas's prequels. The comic relief fell flat. There is an even better aspect here: a lot of ambiguity about what categories the characters fit into. They aren't clearcut good guys or bad guys. Each plot twist brings them to a crisis where they have to decide whether to do the selfish or the compassionate thing, whether to play it safe or go for broke, cheat or stick to the deal. Unlike previous stories, they each make different decisions and develop in unexpected ways. I was often surprised, and that almost never happens when I watch a new Star Wars flick. I'm not sure why some users are trashing this one. Maybe they disagree with its politics, although it really only takes the traditional pro-freedom anti-imperialism stance thst all Star Wars movies have always taken. If anything, I was reminded of old Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall films where they were contemplating how to stand up to the Nazis or to organized crime without being part of an army or a police force. This is a story about estabishing one's independence as an individual in an oppressive, poverty-stricken universe. This is a story about going solo.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
547,The_Film_Auditor,Surprisingly Fun,7,17 July 2018,"With all of the negative news around Solo, the new Disney Star Wars movie, I did not have high expectations for the film. I also felt that the film seemed unnecessary since one of the best parts about Han Solo is his mysterious nature, so a movie that spells out his backstory seemed like an odd choice. Never the less, I saw the film and was surprised at how much I liked it, even though it had many glaring issues.One of the things I really enjoy about this movie is how different it felt compared to the other recent Star Wars movies. Instead of a film about The Empire vs. The Rebellion, the film tells the story of a group of smugglers that steal and get themselves into trouble. The film did not need to have a grand scale ""save the galaxy"" storyline, which was refreshing. Secondly, the film did a better job with referencing the original movies. Instead of slapping the audience with ""hey look, it's a Star Wars reference,"" the film was much more subtle. Solo did not have to use the Star Wars Universe as a crutch; it instead expanded it by adding many new aliens that looked really well done as well as some great new set pieces. All of these things helped Solo feel much more original than any other Disney Star Wars movie to date.Another strong element that the film had was how Han and Chewbacca's characters interacted. The characters acted very similar to how they did in the original trilogy, capturing the fun banter between Chewy and Han very well. It helped that Alden Ehrenreich's performance was surprising well done. Ehrenreich did a great job capturing the spirit of Han Solo. He acted and sounded similar to Harrison Ford's Han solo. Of course, Ehrenreich is not as charismatic as the charming Harrison Ford is, but he had big shoes to fill and he did a good job filling them.Despite the movie feeling much more original than the other Disney Star Wars movies, this film still had many flaws that held it back from being a great film. The first thing that went wrong with the film was the lighting and cinematography. Particularly in the first half of the film, there are many shots where you cannot see what is going on. The shots were so dimly lit that in many scenes, it was hard to tell who or what was on the screen. Some of the colors also looked muddy, making the visuals less appealing than previous Star Wars films. I also thought the first act felt weak. The initial part of the story felt rather expository, even explaining how Han Solo got his name...I mean come on. It also felt like many of the scenes dragged a bit, until the second and third act, which felt better. Lastly, my main complaint of the movie is that it felt unnecessary. Han Solo never needed a backstory. Many of the plot points in this film were minor one-off mentions in the original trilogy that did not need their own film. The film does not add much to the Star Wars story, making it feel like nothing too special. This does not mean the film is not enjoyable. Solo feels like a fun but forgettable addition to the Star Wars story.The Good
-Alden Ehrenreich's performance
-Set and costume design
-Small scale story
-Han and Chewy's Relationship felt like the original trilogyThe Bad
-The lighting/cinematography

548,MiroslavKyuranov,Han Shots First!,7,23 May 2018,"Opposite of the expectations, the film is purely a pleasure for me! The setting itself presents a new part of the Star Wars universe, which has not been presented so far on the big screen. The story is interesting, the characters are great, especially Lando and Chewie. The new characters Beckett, Qi'ra also improve the story very well.It's good to note, that Alden Ehrenreich is not trying to imitate Harrison Ford, but portrays it in a way we have not seen before. It was exactly what he was before he turned into this pessimistic, to a lot of things and a hero we love.Music is an important part of the movie! Together with the relevant scenes, the film takes you to this setting. We really have to respect Ron Howard for his achievement in this film.""Solo: A Star Wars Story"" is not a typical Star Wars movie, but it fits perfectly into the universe and is undoubtedly a pleasure.

It's unknown star Alden Ehrenreich does a decent job stepping into the shoes of a legendary character. Donald Glover has all of the style and panache to sell the performance as Lando. The biggest surprise is that Opie does it again taking less than ideal casting and a risky departure for the saga and pulls it off. But the effects are good not great. The actors are still lost in the very large shadows of their predecessors. But the biggest miss of all is Woddy Harreelson who should not be in this movie.

Don't get me wrong those are all awesome topics I love, but Solo is vastly different to any Star Wars film that came before and after. Instead choosing to focus more of the adventure aspect along with heists and daring missionsAlden Ehrenreich is pretty decent in my opinion as Han Solo. Charming, funny, witty, fearless and adaptable all these things that we get to see from a much older Han played by Harrison Ford in the Original and Sequel TrilogyA great little origin story on one of Star War's classic characters along with meeting and starting a memorable friendship with Chewbacca, and of course meeting Lando Calrissian and how Han manages to get the Millennium Falcon.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
552,Shakor77,Solo for the new generation?,4,4 January 2019,"In the original movies (4-6) Han Solo was the cool sleek smuggler who was even more popular than the character lead, Luke Skywalker.Why was this?Well Harrison Ford's acting skills has some to do with it, but also because the original character was a pretty capable guy. He saved Luke more than once and was pretty much a smooth-talking bad ass.But this Solo? Well he sort of a stooge. He fails more often than not but his is played by a fairly good actor so I would say he is still pretty good.However there are some bizarre parts of this movie that is just weird and awkward. Like that ""female"" droid (why do droids even need genders?) who has romantic feelings for Lando (or vice versa, wasn't sure...). And then you have the run of a mill minor villain turned into some sob-eyed teenage girl freedom fighter? Just weird and awkward, like Disney want to push some social agenda.No. This movie is a decent sci-fi flick but it is nothing like the original Star Wars and Solo character.

I had a 19 year old tell me how awful the movie was, I later learnt that he'd not seen it but was instead repeating what he'd read on the 'internet'. Completely written it off. Why not not just sit back relax and ennjoy the movie and then judge. This movie was doomed before it got out of the starting gate. Personally Im not fussed that this came out just 6 months after the last jedi but I read somewhere that the marketing for this movie should have started 6 months before, which would have confused things around the time when last jedi was released. Perhaps, Im no expert but there could be something in that. The film is very good no doubt - its well acted and again far too much has been made about Alden's casting but he was great, the story was engaging and it was well directed by Ron Howard. This movie came with some baggage but again who cares the end result was great. Go see the movie its fun family entertainment. Star Wars fans are never happy but be honest, no Star Wars movie is ever going to make you feel the way the originals did. You were children when you viewed them. Stop being nostalgic. We're spoilt.

554,JasonR77,Good anthology entry,8,6 June 2018,"Doing a prequel for the odds-on most popular character in the Star Wars universe was going to be difficult. It's not like you can clone Harrison Ford, de-age him to 25, and go.
That said, Alden Ehrenreich did a good job. He had the swagger down, the smirk, the wit, and there were certainly times where he almost took on the appearance of the Episode IV Han. There's no doubt that Harrison Ford's assistance buoyed his performance, and prevented him from potentially falling into the traps of the ""Young brat"" that would then be the dominant take on his performance.
Ron Howard took a difficult task and likely made a better movie than it would have been otherwise, and as such got saddled with a movie that has not been able to shake its difficult reputation.
Donald Glover delivers a remarkable performance as Lando, practically becoming Billy Dee Williams, and displaying the smooth, scoundrel aspects that Han talked about in Empire.
There's a few interesting surprises and references littered throughout the movie, and it's kind of up to the individual viewer to determine if they feel the movie is necessary, and chances are that will shape the opinion. To take it as it is, ignoring such a question, is key to taking it as a whole, complete experience.
A number of things don't quite go as the setup might suggest, which helps keep the film fresh, and leads Han more naturally along his path, and give him opportunities to shine without being forced.
It's ultimately a fun entry into the pantheon, and does the principal characters well, leading them along a plot that's solid enough to keep you tuned in. It's up to you whether that's enough.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

The droid was even more ridiculous. All the big name stars the evil Empire (Disney) stuffed into the story was enough to cause anyone to barf. What made Star Wars work was how unknown the actors where. It is as if no one who worked on this film ever saw the original or if they did they just did not get it. Worse than the Last Jedi is an understatement.

With very little imagination it's not to hard to believe the galaxy, far, far away could actually exist. By putting a lot of effort into the backstories of the characters the creators just add more credibility of the ""could-be-true"" nature of the franchise and that without sacrificing the actual story of the movie.For me, the main issue with the movie is, perhaps surprisingly, the main character Solo himself. The actor looks actually older than Harrison Ford did 40 years ago, though he should be younger. Also character wise, I was not really convinced and this version seems less ""boy-ish"" than the Han Solo of 40 years ago.

Taking an iconic character and throwing an unknown actor into the role that nobody will appreciate is a rough thing to try to sell. The fan backlash happened upon its initial announcement. I think Alden and the supporting cast did a fine job of showing younger versions of our favorites. Plenty of good action and it didn't feel stale at any point. A Star Wars movie like this isn't going to be as big as the last two franchise entries and I think fans are having a hard time understanding that. I enjoyed it immensely and hope they get a chance to expand this story with a few more sequels. Go check it out!,Solo - A Star Wars Story

568,floppylobster-86-283328,You will like or dislike it based on your opinions of the last Star Wars film you saw,7,24 May 2018,"There are going to be many negative reviews for this film. I think that's down to when Star Wars fatigue hits you. Everyone seems to check out of the franchise at some point. For many it was The Phantom Menace, making the following film, The Attack of the Clones, one of the most hated. The other most common disliked film of the franchise has been The Last Jedi, so Solo is suffering a bit from disenfranchised fan backlash. For the record, I disliked the prequels at the time. Then grew to love them despite their faults because of the shear amount of imagination on display. I felt The Force Awakens was a very soulless imitation of Star Wars (with a really poor script) and I have only grown to dislike more upon attempts at rewatching. I felt indifference toward Rogue One (probably because I watched it after my personal low point of The Force Awakens), but in retrospect, and in re-watching parts, I have really grown to like most of it. I felt very little for The Last Jedi. It was competently made but I just don't care for the new characters at all (except maybe Kylo). As for Solo, I liked it. It regained a sense of adventure that has been missing from the latest installments; It didn't have too much forced humour (though I hated L3); and while there were fan call-backs, there weren't too in your face. I would say it was probably the most I'd enjoyed watching a Star Wars film in the theatre in a long time, though I did have very low expectations and afterward I feel almost no need to re-watch it. There was some surprises, yet at the same time it all felt a little inevitable. I mainly rate it for the sense of adventure and the increase in imagination on display (ships designs, creatures, species, locations etc...) but while it had some good moments, it lacked a really great re-watchable action set piece.So depending on where you are with Star Wars in terms of fatigue or hype, you're going to rate it differently. I went in with very low expectations, but enjoyed seeing someone with a connection to George Lucas and his era of film-making directing it. The Star Wars magic is not there, and I doubt will be for anyone, but I would have much rather had this film back in the day over the Ewok Adventure movies. This is a nice filler between main episodes. I just wish the main episodes were better.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

This movie was great fun, lots of action, great cgi, lots of hints to lead to episode one and episodes 4, and 5. Characters were well played too. Very enjoyable fun movie. I gave it a 10 to help boost it against the haters who just never learn to just go home and leave good flicks alone. If you hate it so much why go see it? You knew Disney made it and you still went?

The wry humour and subtle satire of the original trilogy which were genuinely movies for all ages, has been eradicated.This a 'family' movie.

It has a well picked cast with special attention going to Donald Glover who really did honor BD Williams by having his manners and speech down to the very details. Alden Ehrenreich also gave a strong performance, of course Solo wasn't going to be the hardened smuggler in this movie, it's a coming of age movie... yes they could've picked an actor that looked a bit more like Ford, but beside that I did feel I was watching a younger version of Solo... still a bit naive and not as distrusting or egoistic as Solo will become in his later years, but just as full of himself as is one of Solo's strongest character traits.See it, enjoy it... ignore all the crap from people who will try and make you think it's the worst movie ever.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

576,soneil12,Impressive. Most impressive.,9,24 May 2018,"When I saw the trailer for this film I wasn't really sold on Alden Ehrenreich as Han Solo. I didn't think he really looked anything like Harrison Ford's version of the character (unlike Donald Glover who absolutely nailed Bille-Dee William's character of Lando). I was willing to give him a chance if his performance was good though.Watching the movie, I still didn't really think he quite seemed like the same Han we moved but he played a good character. After the movie had been running long enough, I was enjoying the character well enough. Harrison Ford's a hard act for anyone to follow and he was clearly trying to emulate some of the manerism's speech etc.The other characters are what really sold me on this movie. Donald Glover played an absolutely convincing Lando. The charming smuggler was there again just as I remembered him. I won't say much about the other lead characters to avoid spoilers but I found their performances were all major contributors to my enjoyment of the film.This felt like a starwars film but different enough to not seem defivative. Unlike the main films, jedi/the force and the war with the empire or their equivalent was not a major focus. These were side players and it was satisfying to see other parts of the galaxy far, far away being explored. Like the key characters in Rogue One, these seemed more like regular, relatable people than the lofty heroes we usually see in Starwars films.This a film that could easily be enjoyed by people who aren't big starwars fans. A knowledge of the story and characters from other films is not necessary to appreciate the story. Visual and sound effects were top quality and added immersion without becoming a focus. I found the plot and dialogue to be enjoyable and plausible. There were plenty of nods to characters and events that fans of the series would already be familiar with but unlike some of the more recent starwars films, these nods seemed appropriate without seeming like they were forced in for the sake of it. These ""in"" references never felt over-done. And there were a couple of enjoyable surprises for fans of earlier movies.Overall I found it to be highly enjoyable. Unlike The Last Jedi or The Force awakens which I both found enjoyable but flawed, I found Solo to be a solid, entertaining movie on all fronts.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
577,sastorytellerfilms,Underrated surprise Thank God Ron Howard re-shot 80 percent,10,23 August 2018,The reshoot quality and production shows on this great star wars movie. The original two directors assigned to this wanted to make Han more comedic. Disney made the best decision they have in years here. Wife and I LOVE this movie and Alden plays Solo like he was made for it. Doesn't try or need to imitate Harrison. He just takes command of this character and plays him perfectly. Bravo!,Solo - A Star Wars Story
578,cathalokane,The most bland Star Wars film to date - spoilers,5,25 May 2018,"I feel very conflicted writing this review.Normally after a Star Wars film, I'm simply planning my trip to see the film again. I'm filled with a childish glee and cannot wait to experience the ride again. Now this does not always last. I now basically hate The Last Jedi despite loving it on first watch. I'm also very unsure of the Force Awakens. I love Rogue One though and I think I like it more as I see it more.I feel no desire to see this film again.There was nothing obviously terrible in this film, such as the horrible jarring ""jokes"" in The Last Jedi, or Jar Jar. In fact, it's all very competent. The acting is a bit shoddy here and there, there's some clumsy plot development and there are some twists shoehorned in for the sole purposes of setting up a sequel, but aside from that, everything seems pretty competently executed.So what's wrong with it? I'm not even sure. I found that I was not invested in the story or the characters. Not at all. Whereas with Rogue One the gravity of the situation ensured high intensity drama despite us ultimately knowing what happened, in this film I didn't really feel anything was at stake. I found the entire Kessel run part of the film utterly predictable, over the top during the escape, and ultimately unconvincing. It all felt too contrived to fit the famous reference.I think another part of my boredown was the entirely linear plot. Normally, with Star Wars films there are several high importance events happening simultaneously, building to a crescendo. Here you're just following one path of a story you already basically know the end result of. Towards the end I was almost begging for a Rogue One Vader moment as the film felt like it was just running out of steam. The unexciting moment that came felt out of place and awkward to me, as did the idea of Han donating all of his cash to start the rebellion. For me this devalues his triumphant day saving return at the end of a New Hope.There were some moments I loved here such as the Chewie Han meeting. I thought it was really nicely done, but there is nothing I feel I really want to go back for. In the Last Jedi I will always want to watch the Snoke throne room scene due to its exhilarating moments and utterly awesome choreography. That is despite the Last Jedi being inherently flawed. Here, I can't think of a single stand out scene I want to see again.The saddest part for me in watching Solo, is that I have zero desire to ever see any of it again. It's not terrible, it's just boring and predictable. Oh, and the Han Solo actor did a good job. I thought his performance was convincing but it couldn't save the film for me.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
579,superman1,THE ONLY STAR WARS THAT HAS COLOUR MESSED WITH,8,1 January 2020,"BLACK & WHITE
Why do film makers destroy the picture of their major films? Not since Dunkirk has there been such a blasphemy, properly called Gunkkirk. This distinction or difference is too common like a virus. They just don't get they look like bad prints of 1960's films, with the colour all off, dark, like this world has become, that need remastering, like this world needs. But this is the first black & white Star Wars film. Yeh it's in the past, but not that long ago. Did Ron Howard become completely colour blind?COLOUR CORRECTION
First, you must double the brightness. (By turning up the contrast). A film made in 3D needs more brightness, so what do they do? Less.
Put the colour up to 90 or 100. Yes, that is how much they drain the life out of the film and how much is needed to cure sepia sickness.
Put the green down 10 or 20 % on the colour temperature, to remove that slight sick.GOOD PICTURE
This brings life back into the film, and reality. Chewy is actually brown, different browns, not grey. People have flesh tones, instead of ashen grey like the dead. Snow is white and bright, not dark and grey. Before, it was like some bad dark cartoon, taking you out of reality. Now there is contrast and full range of tones.
Then you can enjoy the film how it was intended. And actually see the Star Wars film with some of the best original creature and droid designs, in full colour. It's a revelation. It's literally been remastered. And soon it doesn't matter the main actor looks nothing like Han Solo. Like Rogue One, this becomes a more real Star Wars film than the new main ones, surprisingly elegantly dis-covering all of Hansome's previous mentioned plots with continuous action.Apart from the many-bluelight-eyed creature mistakenly incongruously inelegantly stolen, yet again, from Independence Day/The Matrix/Skyline/.
And like Rogue, a solid different-again distinct droid, unlike the cute Disney main generic thing.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
580,mjhowland,Disney ruins another George Lucas film ...,6,23 May 2018,"Ok, I saw this May 22, a 53 full hours before rest of America can see it.
(NO Spoilers)
It just seems so pretentious of Disney & Kathleen Kennedy (ugh, why is she still here?!) to try & get as many categories, incl. ""humanoid (like C3PO, & R2D2 , but takes place earlier, so they are absent here, Well acted Dan Glover's character was the best cast. Yet there are so many twists & turns in this film, you will feel like the girl from the ""Exorcist""! Though I dislike the real person, Woody Harrelsin, his character is not far off from his real life persona, very common in acting, and thus his character is so believable, just wish they would have picked Christian Bale.
 The Millenium & Chewbacca origins are revealed, the only redeeming qualities of the film, though the grand act of generosity at the end of the film 
is the only redeeming ""George Lucas"" like quality of the film.
Since Ron Howard directs, his brother has a part in the film, an acceptable form of nepotism, unlike certain first families...
The closed sets are more in line with George Lucas's perspectives of a Star wars movie, thus he would like that part of this feature film.
It is no spoiler to say the ""Game of Thrones"" Emilia Clarke was hired to help bring along her fanbase ( which seems huge considering the success of GOT)
but fortunately her character was written to make her endearing with not too much feministic bravado in her role, a character trait too overdone in todays films. Thus Qi'ra rise from nothingness to a role thirsting for something more, is believable and makes her character flaws and actions believable. 
The 6'11"" Joonas V Suotamo, a former Finnish basketball player is the new 
man who portrays Chewbacca now, though the 4"" taller, but ailing Peter Mayhew who at 74 has obvious health issues but is still very much alive. Fortunately, this character is a ""humanitarian"" to his race, a trait welcomed in this film, which is all too needed in this American, Russian, Korean, or whatever faulty society we are forced to live in today & Ron Howard tried his best to bring this out in this film. Is it enough? , time will tell ... As of this moment, the turns & twists in this creation to keep you guessing can be a bit too tedious, or too long, for many.

581,leegato,"Flawed, But Still A Lot of Fun",7,25 May 2018,"OK, OK, sure, this is a cash grab by Disney, they're making more money off the Star Wars legacy, OK, sure, this could compromise what Star Wars means, alright, let's get past that. Given you're reading this review I'm not going to go over the details on what this film is about, and instead focus on my first initial impressions after watching this at a late Thursday night showing.Solo: A Star Wars Story is a decent film that adds to the story arc of one of Star Wars' most famous characters, Han Solo. Alden Ehrenreich does a great job at portraying the morally ambiguous outlaw we come to love in the original Star Wars film; his performance conveys a bit of Harrison Ford's original charm, but adds a new personal spin with Ehrenreich's own brand of charm and wit. The film knows he can't be exactly Harrison Ford, and instead focuses on what makes Han Solo Han Solo. It's more character development for him. Donald Glover also does an excellent job portraying Lando Calrissian, adding particularly extra effort to emulate his inner Billy Dee Williams impersonation with Donald Glover humor and charm.The story is so-so. I found it very anti-climactic at some points; I think, with Star Wars films, we're so accustomed to these big grand finales or big battles in each film that it's a bit unexpected to see that this film just ""ends"" like that with some really minor battles and firefights. There are also some ways that the film's plot tries to incorporate the Rebellion culture that ultimately ends up forming the bulk of the Rebellion, and it feels a bit forced down and ham-fisted into the plot for the sake of trying to get Han out of some mess he's in, and not add anything to the Rebellion storyline in the greater Star Wars universe (as Rogue One did). The plus side is we see some iconic moments in Star Wars folklore come to life on screen, including the Kessel Run and the Millennium Falcon's origins (as well as its context)!This film is loaded with action sequences, and none of them are necessarily drivel or weak. Ron Howard employs a documentary-like style at times to place viewers in the action, and the use of handheld camera really adds to the sense of urgency and interaction in the crew depicted in the film.Overall, Solo brings some of the most talked-about moments in Star Wars folklore to life on the screen, letting audiences witnessing the near-legend-like origins of Han Solo and how he becomes the well-connected smuggler outlaw that we come to love in the Star Wars saga. With subtle and surprise references and cameos, the film opens up the possibility of more to come, and leaves the audience with a fun, brief visitation into the world of Star Wars.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
582,femkemvs,Disjointed and dull,4,13 August 2019,"Solo is a movie that had potential, but lost it somewhere in the midst of a lot of bad decisions. The biggest problem I found was its lack of focus. It wanted to be a Han Solo origin story, a heist film, a love story and a Rebellion origin story all in one film, while also throwing in the Millennium Falcon, the Kessel Run and anything else remotely connected to Han Solo for good measure. It felt disjointed and hard to find any connection to anything or anyone. This film also made a lot of stupid decisions. The nature of Han and Chewie's meeting was up there as one of the cringiest things I have ever seen in Star Wars and while Donald Glover gave an amazing performance as Lando, the writing for his character was just dumb. The only parts of the movie I really enjoyed were the obscure callbacks to things such as Clone Wars and the action scenes, which were admittedly well-done.

584,rolando19552001,Solo A Star Wars Story,9,25 May 2018,"SPOILER: Solo A Star Wars Story The film is over two hours long, around 2 hours and a quarter, but although some scenes seemed forced and could have been trimmed and clipped, the film overall works. The film works on its own two feet, you don't have to be a Star Wars super fan to understand but there are a lot of Easter eggs that if you are a Star Wars fan you will grasped and relish as there are many throw backs, the most intriguing and whirlwind to your brain near the end of the film as you are dumbfounded and realized if what you saw is reasonable, cogent, possible, does it make any sense. The scene is a throwback to the early film of the prequel trilogies and there is no more to say, to understand that scene you must watch George Lucas prequel trilogies. That scene is quite spellbinding and alluring to grasp the continuum of the Star Wars universe. The Han Solo actor is a newcomer that had a couple of films under his credit but this is his star vehicle as he performs great, he grasp the Han Solo persona that Harrison Ford made so famous in the original trilogy, the man who tells himself and others that he is a bad guy, an outlaw, a fugitive, that he runs away when there is danger and hit and hides and runs, but Han Solo is like one young character of the film well said, he is a warrior and a leader for all the galaxy. Han Solo can be described as an antihero, the reluctant man who thinks he is no good, but in the end when the drama and the engagement unfolds, Han Solo makes the right choice and like he has always delivered in all the Star Wars films, Han Solo would not failed in his self-title film, his own vehicle. Now a little plot, at the start of the film Han Solo is under the never ending cycle of criminality that he had been trapped under a crime cartel that uses young men and women and other sentient creatures for obtaining material wealth so that they could gain from them, they are especially interested in a power generating cubicles that are very expensive, millions of credits even in large quantities. Han Solo had a love before Princess Leah in a New Hope, when Han Solo is trapped in that crime cartel cycle, he founds his true first love in the character played by Emilia Clarke, who when you look at her innocent face, even in the beginning of hit series Game of Thrones, Emilia´s young and innocent faces plays perfectly by the character Daenerys. Emilia Clarke countenance seemed to present in her face innocence, no wrong, good feelings, her big eyes show empathy but you should never judge a person by his or her face. Han Solo falls for the face of the young woman and her big empathetic eyes and he fells deeply in love with the young luscious and stunning young woman. Han Solo and his paramour find a way to escape from the crime cycle and when they are about to both escape a moment of indecision changes both their lives forever. If she could have been able to run away with her beau that she harbors feelings for even later in the film, maybe their story would have been different. But what matters is what happened and Emilia Clarke´s character is left behind to have a divergent and more insidious and pernicious transformation. Han Solo is heartbroken for the separation of her love of his life, Qira and then with no other way out enlist and joins the Imperial Navy to become the best pilot of the galaxy. Han Solo is next shown three years later battling as a foot soldier in one of the Empire´s war of control and he barely escapes with his life in the mud and rain of that war ravaged planet. There he meets one duplicitous and amoral character in Becket, played by the glare and smear of Harrelson who gives his repertoire of charisma and scowl to give credence to this Becket character that tries to give advice to young Han Solo who is budding and learns seeing all people and things, Han Solo has his eyes wide open and he is a highly intelligent man who is always very reluctant to provide and gives his help, but if he finds a right cause he will fight until the last chance being spend for the right path. Han Solo also finds a mud pit his best friend Chewbacca and they speak both their languages and find common cause and become the best friends the far away galaxy from Star Wars had ever seen. Becket has a crew, Rio a pilot that says he is great but when he sees Han Solo pilot he must agree that Han Solo is a great pilot in his own right, better even than him. After a one of their retrieving missions fails where Becket loses his partner, Val, Han Solo and Chewbacca follow Becket towards the man that overlords Becket a dark force in the galaxy, Vos who is played by malicious and villainous accent and voice by Paul Bettany and then they bargain a hard deal, to erase the debt they all have with him, they must go towards the ore mine planet were the raw energy material that is highly valuable, is found and then go to a processing facility for the materials to be refined, a refinery so that the material can be tamed and used effectively. They somehow manage to do this, in a very long and complicated sequences of events that had the help of an old friend from the original trilogy who comes with his most valuable possession the Millennium Falcon and lends a hand for his own interest and has a hate, love relationship with Han Solo that was seen in the original trilogy. After the work is done, barely, a very near damn thing indeed, very close, inches short close made. Then the denouement is made when a group of rebels that are seen as a malicious force truly are the future of the resistance and Han Solo seeing that the young woman who commands this budding rebellion is morally right fights for her and her cause, the budding rebellion, one of the best moments of the film is seeing young Han Solo knowing in his heart and soul that this is the best choice he had ever made, fighting for something greater than him and money and credits, fighting for a higher force, Han Solo may never have been a Jedi master, a padawan, a Jedi Knight, but truly the Force has always been strong in Han Solo, one of the best characters of Star Wars universe. The denouement of the film is done, with conniving plots, moves, counter moves, with lies, treachery and that great throw back scene from the first prequel films. Han Solo learns that Chewbacca is a great friend, always the best of his friends and wins the Millennium Falcon, the lucky dices are seen throughout the movie, Han Solo says it´s luck, but Han Solo like all those great heroes has a star on his side, call it fortune, luck, virtue, the star and the dices always have favored the heroes and Han Solo is favored by fortune, his lucky dices, luck, call it what you want, Han Solo shines, he has always shone in the Star Wars universe and Star Wars Story Solo is no exception, great film, a film for everyone, for every fan who does not have a prior knowledge of the Star Wars canon and for the Star Wars super fans they would love the film, Solo is not alone the film delivers.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

Along with all the mixed reviews when it hit theatres, I just didn't have a need to see it right away.That said, I really enjoyed it. Ron Howard did a good job of finishing this movie, but I am curious as to what Lord & Miller would have made (especially considering how well Spider-Verse was done).like I said before Harrison Ford IS Han Solo for me, but Alden Ehrenreich did a serviceable job. He definitely created his own Solo while giving some nods to the way Ford played him. I'm always a fan of Emilia Clarke (KHALEESI) and of course Woody Harrelson. Donald Glover just crushes it and I wish we had more time with him.Aside from liking the new characters, the visuals are really well done, and it had a simple enough story to keep me engaged. Showing Han Solo's beginnings, meeting Chewie, and showing how he came to be the smuggler we know of him today. I'm glad I finally got to see it, not sure where it ranks for me among the recent Star Wars movies but it's definitely worth a watch.also, Disney - If anything else comes of this, can we PLEASE get a Lando movie?!",Solo - A Star Wars Story

If you stop trying to see Harrison Ford and just enjoy it for what it is, a fun summer movie, then you'll probably like it as I did. There are a few plot holes here and there but if you aren't being overly critical they are forgivable. My only main complaint is that I didn't really like the music, it seemed way to intense in some scenes. Other than that, this is well acted and as a person who's first major crush was Han Solo, I enjoyed Alden in the role and think he does a great job of playing everyone's favourite space cowboy. I have a feeling this is one of those movies that gets better the more you watch it. I adored The Hobbit for a very long time and so my expectations for the movie spoiled the fun and I didn't like it at all the first time I saw it but I gave it a second chance and now it's one of my favourite movies!

I, on the other hand, went to see this knowing that no one but Harrison Ford can look and sound like Harrison Ford, and so I wasn't asking for that...what I was hoping for was a fun ride, one that would give me the backstory of a character many of us have known all our lives, and I was rewarded with a story that went beyond my expectations, because not only did it do that, but it went above and beyond by doing many cool ""side things"", for example actually letting me/us ride along on the famous ""Kessel Run"" that Solo became so famous for in the later chapters. The way I figure it, this movie faced an impossible task - to make us believe that we were watching the true Han Solo, but younger than we'd ever seen him before - and for my money, they pulled it off. Nice job, everyone.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

One thing I liked about it above all of the other Star Wars movies - no The Force! It's real science fiction!! No magic. No superpowers.Of course It's not even remotely hard sci-fi, but it doesn't have that Force fantasy permeating the movie, forcing us to ratchet up our suspension of disbelief to the witches, vampires and superheroes level.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
590,Watcher42,Remove the Star Wars and this is still a bad film,5,16 September 2018,"If you love Star Wars, you will be very disappointed.If you love sci-fi adventure films, you will be pretty disappointed.If you love good acting, scripts, and characters, guess what? You'll be disappointed.But if you love mindless movies with no character development, little story, and the most interesting thing being the special effects - then you've come to the right place.No one asked for or wanted a Han Solo origin story. Part of the charm of 'original' Han is that a) it's Harrison Ford, and b) he's a bit mysterious, he's a rogue, a scoundrel - none of which comes across hereTrying to crowbar in a lifetime of Han's experiences in to a 2hour film just doesn't work. It tries to be a fan service movie by filling it with cute references and throwbacks to the original trilogy. If you can think of any reference to Han's past from the other Star Wars movies, it will be mentioned and probably resolved here.This would be somewhat acceptable if the rest of the cast was more than a bunch of paper thin tropes. Beckett, Qi-Ra, L3-37, Val - all forgettable. And special mention should go to Emilia Clarke for a Razzies worthy performance. It's seriously as if her entire direction was 'just be yourself'.Donald Glover does a good Lando. Chewbacca is great as usual, although I suspect if you know Wookie you'll probably find his lines as cringey as L3-37's.Disney has a huge number of interesting characters from the periphery of Star Wars to dig in to. And the success of Rogue One shows Star Wars fans and moviegoers will respond well to original stories. But instead they produce this travesty.I can only imagine how bad it must have been before Ron Howard got involved.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
591,crom-dubh,Surprisingly good,7,23 June 2018,"I was incredibly skeptical going into this. I thought there was little chance they could create a younger version of Han that had even a small fraction of his charisma. I also have not been the biggest fan of The Force Awakens or The Last Jedi (although I was a big fan of Rogue One). One of the things I disliked about especially The Force Awakens was how steeped in fan-service it felt, which is one reason why Rogue One worked so much better - with the exception of Vader, it did not rely on established beloved characters for its story, and would sink or swim on the merits of its own narrative. In that regard, Solo is a bit of a combination of those two realities. Here we have an origin story for perhaps the most beloved Star Trek character of all, with a decent amount of references to things we learn about Han from the original trilogy, but it still manages to mostly feel like its own thing. The narrative itself has very little to do with the original trilogy. I was also pleasantly surprised by how well Alden Ehrenreich did in the role. Let's be clear: he's no Harrison Ford. But I admire him for taking on what must have been the daunting task of trying to even partially fill his shoes. The character here is a bit of its own thing, not quite as swaggering as Ford's depiction. I found myself appreciating that he sort of found his own way into it rather than trying to do a Harrison Ford impersonation. He definitely defied my expectations that he would fail in the role. The other characters are mostly good as well. Glover did a fine job as Lando, although if anything I thought he was rather underutilized. Emilia Clarke, Paul Bettany, and Woody Harrelson also turn in decent performances. The rest of the production are mostly good, not amazing. The cinematography is decent, with most of the more open shots being very good but some of the action being a little less inspired. I didn't feel like the direction was anything special most of the time. The music is mostly excellent, using a bit of a mix of Williams themes and some newer ideas. This helped the film feel new but not totally disconnected from the spirit of the earlier films, despite the somewhat drier visual aesthetic. I hope people at least give this one a chance, because I think a lot of folks are probably prejudiced against it for reasons previously mentioned.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

Now here's the problem: They butcher the Star Wars franchise to put the label on it and it's making it a lot worse.My problem with it in particular is that it tries desperately do be a Star Wars movie but it's more or less in the area of ""fan art"". It makes you smile every once in a while but you wouldn't think of watching it again or recommend it to a friend. But then again I am thinking about the budget of the movie and the whole industry behind it.The first one of the Disney adaptations (forgot its name...) was good, Rogue One was even excellent and it entirely caught me off guard. This one is just a huge step down and is far from good. And like I said. Squeezing it into the Star Wars universe is what's wrong with it. 4 out of 10 for several reasons: great visuals, as expected, great sound, as usual, decent story. This would have been 6 points, however I have to vote this down quite a bit for the horrible acting performance (except for Emilia Clarke and Woody Harrelson) and the fact that they force it into the Star Wars universe.Every Star Wars fan will know exactly what I mean.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

It was well shot, relied on true story telling and wasted nothing on trite overused lens flares or jumpy journalistic crap shooting styles. The props were tight and designed to be chronologically appropriate for its position in the franchise. I liked it a lot. I would give it a place in the top three and would have to watch the others again to decide if it's my second or third favorite. At release the online media was whining about franchise sequels losing their draw power. I feel that killed its chances in a lemming-cult-following-of-a-movie-audience that needs explosions and lens flares to keep them involved. There was no shortage of action, great storyline, good character development and worth every cent. Check it out for yourself and then help spread the word.

601,malcydon,A well done movie.,8,7 June 2018,"A good movie. It was done really well, and I really recommend it to everyone. As a fan I was honestly suprised. It's the original trilogy level.
After the whole fiasco with Disney and Star Wars 8, most people didn't expect a good movie, and that will be seen on sales. But this movie is what Star Wars needed. A hope, a base, a pillar for the franchise. A sign that there is a will behind the Star Wars.If I could snap my finger and make magic come true, than I would give the new trilogy to this man (Ron Howard), these writters (
Jonathan Kasdan, Lawrence Kasdan), and this team.Actors:
They did a really good job. They had good scripts too. You can see human characteristics on the role they are playing. You can feel emotions, doubt, thinking. When a character is in a.. danger, you can see him trying to find a way out, like a rat trapped in a cage.
I feel the characters were at a good place at good times. Their roles made me feel good.The robot scared me though. He seemed to be a feminist character. But later I realised that it is a symbol for it and what will happen to him, but also his stand is clear in case of lore. Enviroment:

602,BrentCowey,Han Solo - a movie let down,4,7 June 2018,"What should arguably have been the best Star Wars movie for me became one of the worst. 
Han's edgy attitude and Space Cowboy quips and outlook on life should have meant a real character adventure. 
This was just a family movie with family chuckles thrown in for good measure, wrapped up in the Star Wars franchise as icing on the cake. 
I quite liked Han and Chewy in the film, and their meeting and the general back-story (all of which could have been wrapped up in minutes, not a feature film) was OK. 
Other reviews here have said things more eloquently than me, but I would add that having the likes of Woody Harrellson and Thandie Newton (such well known actors) actually spoilt it for me, they are too well known to be 'real' in this youthful backstory. Mentally strip away the cloak of ""Star Wars"" and the relevant names, and what are you left with here? A futuristic train heist/adventure/robbery that goes wrong and the bad guy has a bigger bad guy boss. 
Queue relevancy for future revenge/debt. For me, having queued to watch the original Star Wars film in 1977, I WANTED to like this (although I can say it was a fun-ish family action/adventure film disguised as a Star Wars) but it was a huge let-down.

It seems the only territory yet uncharted by the Star Wars franchise is the vast land know as mediocrity, but Solo lands smack dab in the middle. Feminist droids, an impossibly convenient encounter, and a weird spoiler aside, there's nothing particularly bad about Solo. It's a vast improvement over Episodes Seven and Eight. And yet, nothing stands out. Don't be surprised if you find yourself forgetting that this is a Star Wars movie while you're watching it.

606,hughrcarson,Arguably the best Star Wars-related film since The Return of the Jedi,7,12 September 2018,"Even given Hollywood's current tiresome obsession with playing the identity politics and female empowerment cards, (something that continues unabated in Solo: A Star Wars Story), this latest instalment of Disney's increasingly bloated Star Wars franchise, has to go down as something of a hit.Ron Howard takes the Director's chair on this occasion, regaling to us the backstory of just how it was that Han Solo came to be such a loveable rogue, and iconic film character of the 1980's.First and foremost, a bold statement:Solo: A Star Wars Story is, all faults-aside, arguably the best Star Wars-related film since The Return of the Jedi.But before you strike me down with your light sabre and throw me into the Great Pit of Carkoon, I insist that you hear me out.The loose ends were all tied up in 1983 with Return of the Jedi's feel-good conclusion, waving goodbye in the process to the concept of Star Wars as we knew it, and for what we presumed would be the final time. One of the great cinematic trilogies - unquestionably - was at an end.Though taking something of a lengthy sabbatical, the whole notion of Star Wars, it turns out, was very much not at an end, and has since spawned any number of additional chapters. But I'd say it's fairly inarguable that the franchise has continued to find itself in something of a rut, weighed down by the huge expectation of its own making that has been almost entirely impossible to fulfil.Interminable musings regarding 'the dark side', 'the force' and the nigh on impossible quest to reach Jedi status, has become enormously tiresome and produced a whole raft of inferior sequels that lack both originality and any sort of impact; each almost duty bound to adopt both painfully predictable story lines and tried and trusted character sets, something that has, to a large extent, mired the Star Wars franchise in a sort of cosmic quicksand of its own making.With the release of every new (yet painfully old) film, the franchise's faithful, bordering on obsessed fan base is provided with its bi-yearly fix of Star Wars-related morphine to keep them ticking over until the next time, or until such point as they can finally admit to themselves that Star Wars 'just ain't what it used to be.'No matter the director, the screenwriter or indeed any significant advancements in technology, nothing ever really seems to change. There's been a real sense of Groundhog day when it comes to all things Star Wars.Until now, that is...Don't get me wrong, Solo: A Star Wars Story does not exactly redefine the whole concept of Science Fiction. Far from it. And it too owes much to what has preceded it.But there definitely is something that feels a little fresher, less predictable and laborious about Ron Howard's Solo: A Star Wars Story. This is a film that puts aside the Star-Wars-by-numbers narrative guide, setting this film free - to some extent at least - from the shackles of Star Wars expectation.Han Solo, Lando Calrissian and the big Wookie himself, Chewbacca, aside, Solo: A Star Wars Story resists the temptation to shoehorn in pointless cameo appearances of the established Star Wars characters of yore, though we are treated to the usual smattering of bizarre weird and wonderful life forms congregated, as ever, in seedy drinking and gambling dens.Bar the understandable intrigue as to how Han Solo initially hooked up with his furry friend, Chewbacca, Solo: A Star Wars Story, thankfully has the feel of a film that's not actually dependent upon the over-riding Star Wars narrative.This is an effective, simple tale of smugglers, scheming rogues and villains, enhanced through some fun performances from the likes of Woody Harrelson, Emilia Clarke, Paul Bettany and in particular Alden Ehrenreich, whose lead performance is loaded with a convincing blend of both cheek and charm, something that Harrison Ford himself would no doubt be proud of.Solo: A Star Wars Story may be but a small piece of the ever expanding intergalactic Star Wars jigsaw, but unlike so many pieces before it, this one more than ably stands alone.A thoroughly entertaining high energy romp, and something for which Ron Howard should be roundly applauded.This and hundreds of other films are reviewed on my WaywardWolfBlog",Solo - A Star Wars Story

Ehrenreich does a good job emulating Ford's facial expressions and voice, but he can't make up for Emilia Clarke's lack of acting ability nor Harrelson's poorly played Beckett. Glover wasn't all that bad but couldn't channel the original Lando played by Billy Dee Williams. The plotline doesn't help one bit. It's just stupid. Why introduce the needless plot hole of Darth Maul? Why make Solo an Imperial soldier when he never brings that up in the original 3 movies, which would be germane to the plots there?

That's why it took me this long as it did to actually get a RedBox copy of it and watch.First things first. I did not see the very explicit over the top PC/LGBTQ messages in the movie it was accused of. The only thing that one could remotely classify it as such would be over the top feminism in the likes of L3 robot. Another ""social justice"" message one could not miss would be the struggle of the oppressed (nothing to see here really). So that was that. I would not boycott this movie for these two things I saw.However, what was appalling to me was that the writers managed the unthinkable. That is, turn something that could be very exciting into a complete 2 hours of boredom. There is no other way to say it. The movie was absolutely boring to me which for StarWars franchise says a lot. I grew up on StarWars IV, V, and VI. There was nothing original in it. The big ticket item scenes were lifted from other movies. Entire movie felt like a collage of everything I saw in the past, not only in StarWars but other series as well (Firefly train robbery, for example).So to sum up, the movie deserved the criticism but not for what I originally thought for.

It was familiar with the Star Wars universe, but original in its own way, showing us more that this galaxy holds. It had grit, humor, drama, comedy, friendship, romance, and some cool surprises.It told a story of Solo's earliest adventures as a young man, and Ron Howard as director did a phenomenal job. Aldren did exceptional, to the point where I could believe him as a younger Han. Donald Glover killed it as young Lando, to where I hope to see more should they greenlight the next two films.The Star Wars Universe is so much bigger than the original 3 films, and you can't hold them over the heads of these new ones so harshly; you can't beat the old trilogy.

615,Tkbn3812,"Meh; starts off a little rocky, recovers a bit then disappoints by the end",6,3 June 2018,"Solo was a highly anticipated movie for quite a while. Then it came out and something happened; it hasn't done that well at the box office, especially for a Star Wars movie.I think it's partly to do with it coming out not too long after Infinity War and Deadpool 2, so maybe cinemagoers are getting a little tired. But there's also the lukewarm critical reception, only receiving 71% on Rotten Tomatoes, not even certified fresh!I finally watched the movie today, and I thought it got off to an alright albeit rocky start. Alden Ehrenreich sadly doesn't pull off Han Solo, but when you're being compared to Harrison Ford I think it's fair to cut some slack. The movie kept going, and I think the plot started to get a little messy. Coaxium is the Macguffin of this story, tossed around as this very important fuel source even though I don't think in all the Star Wars movies it's ever been mentioned. The film just never really gets into it; it starts off in one direction before ditching that and going for another direction, before ditching THAT and going in another direction, and it just keeps doing that till the end.Okay, so the movie does recover a little in the action scenes. Particularly I praise the two heist scenes. But, well, that's the problem; heists can usually be awesome but somehow Solo manages to make them reasonably boring. Other than the explosive action there's no real intrigue since the heist kinda just happens, the audience doesn't really get a clear description of it.Then the film begins to climax and it gets even more muddled. It's definitely one of those movies that would be a lot clearer the second time (but it'd also be a lot more boring). The climax is really disappointing, it feels like basically nothing happens, I honestly was so confused as I watched the final scene and came to the realisation that the movie was basically already over. The movie is a visual spectacle, I can say that. It's just not particularly fun. I mean, it's okay but it's not great. It's watchable but it's not mind-blowing. It's just missing something; some flow and sense of direction. It's a shame too, because I was certainly hoping it'd be a good heist movie...and then it wasn't.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

Personally, I enjoyed every minute of it.
Why ten stars, if it's not perfect?
After sitting down to watch it....knowing I nearly dismissed it because of the negative reviews here....I could NOT give it any less, AFTER following it to the very end.
There was action and adventure and glorious panoramas, and an impressive assortment of aliens....and yes, Romance was woven into this movie from start to finish. Musically, it is indeed reminiscent of the Star Wars Saga, and so it should be. Story-wise....the writers injected originality amongst the familiar patterns we are accustomed to, in any Star Wars movie.

There's a lot of action, of CGI, of mithology and the reprise of a lot of John Williams' themes but is so predictable, it retakes so many scenes from the previous Star Wars movies and the jokes are so lame that I yawned many times along the second act, what never had happened to me with any of the previous SW movies. To pull out Miller and Lord and hire Howard once the production had begun and not giving him too much time to get involved in the process has resulted in a cold and one hundred times seen movie. Even the scenes that haven't been copypasted from the SW universe are easily recognizable form other films. It's closest to Howard's adaptation of the Robert Langdon's movies than the director that made Apollo 13 or Cinderella Man or Willow. 
The beginning is quite illustrative. The prologue and introduction of the main character lacks a bit of vigour but the worst moment is when the title of the movie appears...in the middle of the action. If the title would had appear once Han had achieved his task with an epic music that could have stablished the tone of the whole movie but instead it feels anticlimactic and defines the mood of a continuous deja vu whitout charm.
The cast is really good except Emilia Clarke (who I love as Daenerys) that doesn't seems to get the character and passes more time trying to be cute than creating an identity. Maybe not her fault but Howard's. 
The best part of the movie is the third act even not being too surprising but at least has that firmness that I missed the two previous hours.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
623,srawrats,"It's a fun movie, leave your baggage behind and just enjoy it.",9,26 May 2018,"No real expectations like Last Jedi, I'm over that, so I don't care who made this movie, I left all that baggage behind, just went in looking for a good original heist movie. I didn't expect it to be my vision, because truth be known, the best part of the original trilogy, is our imagination, the world we make in our own minds. So, I didn't expect a Harrison Ford copy, just a good portrayal and overall feeling of the character, but from all the pre-movie chatter I thought Alden Ehrenreich would be horrible. Guess what? I thought he was great, and stole the show! Donald Glover great, but I think the writing for Lando wasn't the best. Woody Harrelson was a perfect choice for the part of Beckett and right on point, Emilia Clarke as Qi'ra was also very well acted, as was Paul Bettany, he was really good as Vos. I do think the interaction between Han and Chewbacca could have been a little better, but they are just getting to know each other so maybe that's it. The only thing I didn't like that much was L3-37 droid, just didn't work for me.I think it's a fun movie with great ending, I think Alden nailed a very young Han, you can even see changes over the course of this movie, he becomes more like the Han we know, and they show us how and why he is like he is, you know the shoot first Han, the cynical Han, but the Han that deep down actually has a heart. The Story was great, it had a good flow, and the absolute best was the ending, the last 15-20 minuets was perfect. I loved the ride, and I will watch it again for sure, but what about a sequel? I have a bad feeling about that...nahhh, it will be fine, yeah fine.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
624,cherchezan,"I don't get it, it was actually pretty good",6,20 August 2018,"As someone who absolutely hates the Force Unleashed and the Last Jedi I actually found Solo very enjoyable and felt that it captured a lot of the Star Wars spirit, although in a very different style than the old films. It felt more like a video game, like the Jedi Knight series or something. I found it quite a bit of fun to watch and found it covered the plot whole with the Kessel run quite well. Sure, it wasn't a masterpiece, it could have been way better but it's a solid 5 out of 7 any day. Fun to watch movie, way better than the sequels, has a fun feeling to it, not without it's flaws but overall a fun movie to watch. A mature audience will probably appreciate it more.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
625,barryweir,It's.....OK.,6,28 May 2018,"I'll just caveat this review from the start by saying I came at this movie agenda free. I was not part of the audience/Star Wars fandom who went into this movie holding a grudge over The Last Jedi, a movie I did not think was particularly bad despite the huge fan backlash it received. I have no interest in boycotting any Star Wars product right now and have generally found the Disney Star Wars output serviceable to date. However, for me this is where the shine began to wear off. Quite simply this movie should not have been made. The Han Solo of the original Star Wars relied very much on the charisma of Harrison Ford. We knew he was a hot shot pilot and a scoundrel. We knew he was a legend for the ""Kessel Run"". That was it. That was his character. The rest was entirely down to Ford taking that one dimensional background and creating an entertaining character out of it. Quite simply you take him out of the picture and you lose a good 60-70% of the Han Solo character. Because of the amount of Han Solo that was Ford, Alden Ehrenreich is unrecognisable as the character. He just comes across as a generic 20 something American actor. While I would never expect an impression of Ford, you at least expected to be reminded of the character, in the same way as you could believe Ewan McGregor was Obi-Wan Kenobi. But here I did not recognise the character at all. That proves how Ford is irreplaceable because it shows how much the character relied on Ford. It is also unfortunate that the movie comes only two and a half years after Ford last played the role. So right from the off the movie has a key problem. Given that there is little back story to Han Solo you'd think there is a bit of scope for an interesting story. But what we get is the most predictable series of events any Star Wars fan could predict. The Kessel Run. Han meeting Chewbacca. Han winning the Millennium Falcon from Lando Calrissian. All the greatest hits from Star Wars legend. So, again, the movie has another disadvantage. If you are familiar with Star Wars and Han Solo you know what you're going to get before you sit down - and sadly on top of that the mystery and intrigue of these talked about events goes immediately if not done well, a problem suffered by the George Lucas prequel films as well. So, what's the draw to see this movie if you know what you're going to get? Each of these events are played out and, with the possible exception of the Kessel Run, are done so in generally average manner. Afterwards you sit there and ask yourself ""was it worth it""? Sadly I don't think it was. Average, in fact, is a very apt word for the movie. Add in words like ""competent, bland , pedestrian, safe"" in place of words like ""great, stunning, huge fun"". Frankly I was bored for many scenes. This will be in no small part a result of the widely known directorial change. While Ron Howard is a competent director who has in the past given us classics like Parenthood and Apollo 13, here his task is to finish someone else's movie, with specific instructions to stick closely to the script. It shows. There is no personal touch to this movie. It feels like a product, not a director's vision - and how could it not when all of the preproduction and the direction was decided by someone else? Frankly the original directors, Lord & Miller, should have been retained if for no other reason than to give the picture some sort of identity. Then there is the simply fact that you have Disney relying too much on nostalgia for their Star Wars movies by repeatedly going back to the well of original trilogy content. Star Wars is a huge universe, but Disney is making it a small one. When you do that and, worse still, you do it in quick succession, people start to get tired. Disney wants another Marvel style mega franchise , but more thought needs to go in to what made Star Wars special in the first place if they are going to come close. We need an huge, expansive universe instead of just building around the original three movies otherwise over-saturation will be here soon enough. Indeed, as of the time of writing this the box office suggests it may already be here. Is the film flat out bad? No, it isn't. Like I say, average is the key word here. The score is okay, but not Star Wars level epic. The action is fine, but nothing we haven't really seen before. The SFX if as good as previous SW entries. The supporting cast are all competent. The score is good but not great. But nothing truly quite hits the heights required of a SW movie. The humour is just okay. The drama is serviceable. The pacing is largely okay. It just lacks those special wow moments you'd expect from events talked about for forty years, Harrison Ford present or otherwise. For me the movie is instantly forgettable and the weakest of the Disney Star Wars movies. It is casual Sunday afternoon DVD entertainment rather than a blockbuster must see. Disney needs to rethink its strategy if the series is to survive, let alone prosper.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
626,phil-k-664-368870,Star Wars: Attack of the Trolls,7,10 September 2018,"When you look through the reviews you will see a bunch of people voting this just 1 all together one after the other, and then a bit further on similar reviews with similar titles all voting it 2 all of which are not just Trolls but idiots.

Anyone who voted this below 5 should be ignored and anyone who voted this above 8 was probably involved with the movie.This movie ticks all the boxes as far as Star Wars goes with the characters, action scenes, effects, story, aliens ETC. It also has some decent cast and well known faces. So what went wrong? Why is this movie a flop? Maybe too much focus on lesser characters? Maybe needed young CGI version of Harrison Ford like they did with actors in the Ant-Man movies? Maybe Jedi's and epic light saber battled is what draws people in? Maybe the answer is the Han Solo story isn't interesting enough or perhaps and most likely it is one Star Wars movie too many and too soon?We did have the arrival of Chewie, Lando and the Millennium Falcon but it didn't seem to be enough, plus it did tie up some ends and link to some of the other movies, it also had long some what complicated storys as did most of the other Star Wars movies.I recently watched the Star Wars franchise again recently, including some unofficial entries which I have rated out of 10 below.Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope (1977) (8)

Star Wars: Episode IX (2019) (?)The original Star Wars will be near the top apart from the bad acting but it was surpassed in my opinion by The Phantom Menace, The Force Awakens was billed as the big comeback with all the old cast which is why it did so well but didn't jump anywhere near the top of the franchise. Rogue One I enjoyed slightly more and Last Jedi even though was all rated similar but it didn't hit the mark as much as I hoped.I think all of the future Star Wars movies will be good but will never reach the standard of the 1st entry of the 1st and 2nd trilogy. Back to this movie, I would of enjoyed it more with the CGI young Harrison or even a closer looking actor...check Out the Han Solo: A Smuggler's Trade short movie on YouTube...Jamie Costa who plays Han in that movie looks a lot like Harrison.It was the worst Star Wars movie so far...(even thought this is a spin off) but it was still good.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
627,muvbuff-45737,Just ok,6,6 January 2020,"This film could have been much better than it was. While not a bad movie, it doesn't ever justify its existence other than explaining some of the legends behind Han Solo that didn't need to be explained. The film has some pacing issues, mostly during the first act as it has to introduce characters, important settings, and begin the adventure all within around 30 minutes, causing the film to go through exposition followed by intense action and more exposition. The second act is fairly standard, and the third act is where the film picks up with the Kessel Run sequence and the introduction of the first rebels. Overall, however, the film is uneven and can feel pointless at times and never feels like the great Star Wars adventure it should be, often feeling like a film Frankensteined together with reshoots, probably due to the switching of directors between filming.

I liked the movie, although some of the moments were quite predictable. Alden Ehrenreich did great job and was believable as the young Han. The character was simultaneously smart and stupid, confident and shy, leader and loser - this is the original Solo, who we want to see. I think the movie had huge problems with the villains - Paul Bettany wasn't the menace which I expected to see. Solo: A Star Wars Story just needed more from Darth Maul - his one scene was great, but wasn't enough. Finally, the soundtrack wasn't inspiring (like in the other nine films), but the CGI was once again great.

The problem here has come down to the plot. The story was uninspiring and I lost interest midway through.

Good chemistry between Chewie and Han. And I liked the story! It was well written, with some clever lines, and it tied the Solo background story together in a good way.

636,riparianmoler,A mediocre (yet fairly entertaining) movie that tries to represent a perfect character,7,7 August 2020,"Han Solo is one of Star Wars' greatest characters. However, in this movie he doesn't feel at all like Han Solo. Perhaps it is the lack of Harrison Ford, or perhaps it is the new actor somewhat fumbling the role. The confident and suave Han Solo that existed in episodes 4-7 doesn't feel like he's in this movie. The character seems more along the lines of Luke Skywalker.Another issue I have about this film is that it doesn't explore Han and Chewbacca's relationship that much. Chewbacca is forced to be a background character so the new characters (Qi'ra and Beckett) are given more screen time. At times, Han is sidelined to make way for these new characters.However, Danny Glover's outstanding portrayal of Lando Callrissian truly makes this film. His character is consistent with that of the original trilogy, and he is the most entertaining character in the movie. His droid companion, L3, is also a very interesting and entertaining character.Overall, Lando fans will appreciate the film more than Han fans, but it is an entertaining show for all audiences.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

Yeah Disney is really overcompensating on this one. Only terribly unbelievable performance in this movie. Perhaps worst of all is the so called humor. I can't even begin to describe how terrible it is. And with a $275 million dollar budget they still used CGI for the aliens (except Chewbacca) which is easy enough to notice.

638,letande,"Not as good as Rogue One, but still very nice.",8,24 May 2018,"OK, Solo! A Star Wars Story. First of all, I was very excited about this movie. For two reasons. First - I LOVED Rogue One. I absolutely adored it. For me it was literally the best thing since the original trilogy. The atmosphere was there, it closed the most important plot holes and MAN, I loved those CGI actors. So, obviously, I expected a lot from the next ""story"" title.My second reason was Alden Ehrenreich. I didn't expect anything from him until I saw the trailer. The one with the smile. And that smile was so perfect that I was like ""Hey! It's Han! I can't believe it, but it's Han!"" Alden Ehrenreich was so perfect in trailer that it was hard for me not to expect a lot from him. And since I totally hated current Disney's trilogy (episodes VII - VIII), the new movie was supposed to give me some more Star Wars I like. Not the Star Wars with MARVEL's jokes and Luke Trollwalker (no surprise that Mark Hamill didn't like what they did with his character, Luke from The Last Jedi was a huge disappointment).So... did the new miracle happen? Did Solo become a new Rogue One to me? Well... yes and now. First of all, this movie is NOT The Last Jedi. No, sir. Not even close. If you hated The Last Jedi and want some dark atmosphere from the original trilogy instead of ""your mom"" jokes, you should totally check this movie out. There are some jokes here and there, of course, but all in all, the atmosphere is there and it's the right one. Yes, there are those almost-like-lightsabers weapons that I always hated because they don't make any sense, yest, it may feel a bit too weird here and there thanks to the whole freedom motif, but overall, it's the good old gloomy Star Wars. Not the bright new ones with stupid jokes and pokemons. Acting is also pretty good. Not sure if I liked Emilia Clarke, since she literally did her usual Daenerys thing here, but Alden Ehrenreich was fantastic and I totally loved Donald Glover as Lando. It's just scary how much does he fit the role.The story, though... that's where problems begin. When you see at the separate parts of it, there's nothing really wrong with it. Freedom motif? Right thing to do thanks to how it's all about Han Solo. Chewbacca's part? Sure, obviously. Gangsters and contrabandists? Of course. God, they even explained the whole ""who shot first"" thing! The problem is... when all those parts come together... they don't really click. So, it doesn't feel like you're watching a proper movie. Instead, it feels like you're watching some sort of mini-series. Which is OK, bu-u-ut... gives you some sort of weird aftertaste. Especially since some parts may feel somewhat boring (I'm telling you, it's more like a TV format here). But the worst thing is - the mood change. It may feel somewhat fun in one ""episode"" and pretty gloomy in another. Weird, weird stuff. It's like all those writers wrote their parts alone and then tried to combine them in like a day before filming.Finally, I didn't really like some small details. I've already mentioned almost-like-lightsabers weapons (even though I can see why they did that, since this movie takes place in period with no Jedi), but there's more. First of all, L3-37. It's not like I hated her. I totally didn't. And it's not like TECHNICALLY she doesn't fit. Because the whole idea about her character fits perfectly in the original motif. But when you see her in action... it feels a lot like they overdid it a bit. She's like one of those bad actors, who try to steal all the attention and it's just... I don't know. It feels wrong. I also didn't like the fact that story doesn't properly end in this movie. Just because I loved my ""stories"" in Rogue One way. One-shots that shine by themselves and destroy the plot holes. Not sure that I want the big new thing that creates the new ones. Finally, not sure if I liked the decision to bring that one big character from the past back. I won't tell you who it is to avoid spoilers, but you'll sure know when you'll see the movie. The way we separated our ways with that character was one of my most favorite moments back then. And even though there was always some special charm about that character, I'm totally not sure if I want that character back. It felt just right the way that character left. When you bring that character back... I can't say that they did ruin the character in this movie. Just because it was a pretty small appearance. But in the future? There's a huge chance to ruin one of the most charming characters from that period. And I totally don't want that.So, what's in conclusion? In conclusion, I must say I liked Solo. And yes, I can tell that it became MY Star Wars. Unfortunately, thanks to some weird writing and some strange choices, it feels a bit... unpolished. Maybe it needed more time. Maybe it was just unlucky. But here's how I feel - it's like Rogue One, only... not that perfect. If you loved Rogue One as much as I did - go for it, but don't expect too much. But if you didn't like Rogue One and loved The Last Jedi... then you'll probably hate Solo. Just because it isn't for you. Solo is an attempt to please the old school fans. Not as good as Rogue One... but it'll do for now.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

642,Reelnerd,Solo and Chewie: A Star Wars Review,7,28 May 2018,"Solo: A Star Wars Review
By Nelson Nantanapibul
Directed by Ron Howard
Starring: Alden Ehrenreich, Joonas Suotamo, Woody Harrelson, Emilia Clarke, Donald Glover, Thandie Newton, Phoebe Waller-Bridge and Paul Bettany
 I had low expectations coming into this film truth be told. I really didn't see the need for a Solo standalone origin film but we got one. I felt everything we needed to know about the character we learned about in the original trilogy of films. Plus we all heard about the behind the scenes drama where original directors Chris Miller and Phil Lord were fired and Ron Howard being brought on to overhaul the film at literally the last minute.
 I must say I was pleasantly surprised by this film and I found it be a lot of fun and the film has a much lighter tone than the previous two Star Wars films. Alden Ehrenreich does a nice job in the role of Solo and makes it his own he doesn't do a Harrison Ford impersonation. Han and Chewie's friendship serves as the backbone and the heart of this film. Donald Glover as Lando is a pure delight. You do see shades of Billy Dee in his performance but yet again he makes the role his own. 
 Paul Bettany as the villain is quite forgettable which is not altogether surprising as Disney is imposing the Marvel model of filmmaking on the Star Wars universe to mixed results. Woody Harrelson as a sort of mentor to Han is quite good and I am a big Harrelson fan. Emilia Clarke is quite charming as Han's love interest and the rest of the characters are more or less forgettable or underutilized. I think that may have to do in part with the reshoots and the fact that some actors were not available to take part in the extensive reshoots and in some cases certain actors were replaced altogether. Bettany replaced the actor Michael K. Williams as the film's big bad.
 It was fun to see some of the legendary feats attributed to Han in the original films actually play out but it wasn't something that I needed to see. That will be the legacy of this film it was a fun distraction but it adds nothing new to the Star Wars cannon and you don't really learn anything new about Han other than he had a childhood sweetheart not previously talked about in any of the original films. 
 Solo is a breezy action adventure with not a lot of depth but it is a good time. This is probably my next favorite film after The Force Awakens followed by Last Jedi and Rogue One. Chewie probably has the most interesting story arc in the film compared to the rest of the characters. L3-37 the droid in this film I found to be a little annoying to be quite honest. There a couple of fun cameos in the film and one of them really surprised me but I won't spoil them for you in my review. Bottom line I was not expecting to like Solo and I really ended up quite enjoying it. Check it out for yourself.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

This one was very well acted, shot, edited ... everything very well done, but I don't feel the need to see it again. Part of the problem is that I just saw Deadpool 2 last week and will probably see it again, will see it in the cheap theaters before it comes out on dvd and then I'll buy it with whatever extended stuff I can find and won't notice that the shrinkwrap from the dvd has static attached to my leg until the credits have stopped rolling. But this movie I don't feel the need to see again, no shock and awe moments, no part where I was laughing so hard that I missed part of the movie, no crescendo of emotion, I feel a little disappointed.

Also, too many arcs, especially when these arcs aren't great to begin with. Acting is not bad, but the movie overall just seems like a mess.
The movie is ok in most aspect, but It's just not what people wanted from Starwars. The box office has been severely affected by the ""Starwars boycott"" but despite this, a story about Han Solo is still not what people wanted.

It was too dark to be comfortable to watch. If you take the darkness of most of it and add 3D specs, it is a strain on the eyes. Why do film makers do this? In an attempt to create atmosphere, they are making it almost impossible to see some of the detail, and irritating the viewer.

Saw it on the shelf at library so I gave it a shot.Basically, I didn't want to like it, but for the most part it was good - but every time I started to enjoy it, something awful would make it awful again.The short list...
Bad guy Alien queen/vampire in the beginning
Lame speeder chase
Fight with a wookie and speaking the language
""Chance"" encounter with former love
Ridiculous card game McGuffin (and obvious cheating)
Mary Sue feminist robot more annoying than Jar-Jar
Weird subplot suggesting Lando is in love with said robot
Plot surrounding need to make Kessel run fast makes no sense
""I'm gonna hit the brakes and he'll fly right by"" has been done
Baddie who shows up at the end is a 12 yr old girl???
Dryden Voss's security and fighting ability become a jokeThis movie does a huge injustice to Lando's character - he was smooth and cool in Empire. Here he's turned into a punchline, a narcissistic freak. None of that was necessary.And the L3 droid... combines ability to do everything that R2 and C3PO did (along with a few other droids)... in heels, and backwards. ""So sassy"".Despite all that, Woody Harrleson is always fun to watch, and the train scene was mostly fun (though the physics, even with 10 speeders, don't make sense that they could carry a train car... and why not just offload the coaxium canisters... Chewie could carry all of them on his own). Emilia Clark was not very good, mostly wooden and repeating a single emotion (forced smile). The overall plot was like taking every reference from the original trilogy and trying to cram it into 150 minutes. Would have been better to have a couple of movies with some real story and time for development.Not as bad as the other new movies, but not (quite) unwatchable.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

But, it's not a ""movie"" it is simply filling in and tying together all of the hints and asides from the actual movies. Instead of trying to make an interesting story the writers/producers simply tried to stitch together all of the interesting things alluded to in previous movies: How Han and Chewie met, how Han and Lando met, how Han got the Millenium Falcon, all of the nonsense about the Kessel run. Hollywood: Leave the things referenced in the other movies alone. Leave them to the imagination. Do not try to endlessly live off of the other movies. How about an actual story we care about, rather than filling in memorabilia?Making this movie should not have been this difficult. The movie should have been a slam dunk! You have a beloved character, a really interesting fictional character, and the vast expanses of the Galaxy. What do we get? Characters we don't care about and story lines that go nowhere.

We see them in parts and their is some interaction with the main characters.

It wasn't teribble; but it wasn't good either. I tend to think that as the second stand alone Star Wars movie, they didn't need to deal with such an iconic character, unless the story was so compelling that it just needed to be told. And based on the evidence here, it wasn't and didn't. 
The casting was clunky. Clearly aimed at luring a few more bums on seats by appealing to the fan bases of TV pop culture juggernauts Game Of Thrones and Westworld with their respective leads showing up here. I'd pay little attention to this gripe if the movie was fantastic, but it fell far short of that. 
The attempts at humour are hit and miss, and whatever character development there was left me uninvested in their fates; No emotional engagement as I had in Rogue One. 
All in all it was underwhelming and disappointing and as I'm well into my middle age years, I see this as purely an exercise at gaining box office dollars rather than delivering a worthy chapter in the epic Star Wars universe.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
662,ericjcant-1,The Unfortunate Truth About the New Star Wars Movies...,5,26 October 2019,"Most of the newer Star Wars movies aren't bad, but they aren't really that good either. They feel like placeholder movies, waiting for someone with real vision to make their way here. They are good for a watch, but fairly trite, and lacking a sense of independence as the pack in the nods for all the Star Wars fanboys. The package is much better than episodes 1, 2, and 3, but they don't seem to capture any classic elements of their own. Bigger new Death Stars and 50 Star Destroyers on-screen instead of 1 isn't much more than processed cheese creativity. And while our new Darth with a bigger head and a smaller helmet has some interesting qualities, he doesn't come across nearly as complex or developed as he should be considering the heritage he is carrying. What we really needed was better writing, organic and original, and not merely caffeinated boardroom story construction.
With Solo, I think making the connections of what we know of his past was necessity, but again, the writing was too transparent, especially on a second watch. I wanted to see a glimpse of the Han we met in A New Hope; fairly shady, brash and self centered, and only congenial in a forced way. Instead we got a cute pop Han Solo. Fairly chipper and only a criminal due to circumstance.. But at least he fits right in with his smurfy packaged story.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
663,maroinjoundi,Script is pretty anonymous and generic.,7,10 October 2018,"Nothing new under the spotlight. We already know that star wars really died 30 years ago, still i enjoyed this movie. And here's why i did and why it's however still bad.First of all i was afraid, afraid of not having a good Han Solo performance from Alden. Yet, i think he was pretty good, not Harrison Ford good, but that's more a script issue and now we're getting to that.So, the script is incredibly bad. It was like watching any other 2000s 007 movie, i felt like watching a Ride Along sequel at some points. It's a pattern, the classic pattern that we've been using for years for avarage money maker movies, but Star Wars(spin off or not) surely doesn't deserve it. Good guys, bad guys, a betrayal from one of the good guys, random people die(i'm not even kidding, Val and that other guy died for no reason, just to set the fact that Tobias had lost everything and he doesn't care about what would happen to him at the end i guess). The finale was lame, soooooo lame and Tobias' and the scars guy death were not a big of a moment, no pthos, i was waiting for 50 minutes for their death because i knew it was gonna happen, same goes for the other deaths.Useless characters like L3. Why? Was she necessary to the plot? Her death was so contextless, she's a robot for god's sake, why would Lando feel so bad about that, i don't know, people there can fly from planet to planet in 10 minutes but changing a motherboard or having a backup memory for a droid is so hard?But what saves this movie? The actors i must say, the fact that it's a star wars movie and it's impossible to do something stupid bad with that name or at least something badly received. Good peromances, shout out to Donald Glover and Emilia Clarke, and freaking Warwick Davis...why was he there? Just as an extra basically, they gave him one line guys. Bah, never mind that. Woody Harrelson did a good job, even if his character was so predictable, especially the scene where he talks about being predictable but yeah.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

665,ClintWardley1,Why is the sales down on Solo? I know why.,8,3 June 2018,"Why is the sales down on Solo? Well the critics will tell you it's the story. My view its that fans are frightened that it will be a smoking pile of garbage the ""The Last Jedi"" was.I remember going to a Star Wars movies with a real sense of excitement. I had to see the movies within the first week, I was that enthusiastic. I HELP George Lucas make his millions. I've seen each Star Wars movie at least twice in the Cinemas. I have purchased the VHS, the VHS special addition, then I bought the DVD's, then the Blu-rays and then 3D additions. George took his last vacation at my expense. Then came ""The Last Jedi"". I came out of the cinema deeply depressed. It was rubbish. AND I flatly refuse to purchase the ""The Last Jedi"" Blu-ray, I will not soil myself.Thanks Disney and Rian Johnson you hack, for destroying the Star Wars buzz I feel when I used to see a Star Wars movie.Before I move onto Solo, can I ask one question. Just like in Solo, has the Star Wars galaxy been taken over by an unholy cabal between Disney and the paid critics? Why is the IMDB members review of ""The Last Jedi"" so vastly different than the paid critics? The members rightly point out the plot holes, the total abandonment of Star Wars ethos, the mediocrity, product placement and the silly script. YET, the paid critics rave about the how it's the perfect addition to the Star Wars Universe. Did they see another version from what the punters saw? What the frack is going on? C'mon is someone getting paid off?Even the IMDB score looks very suspect, 7.3, whaat? Was there a sudden jump in membership all registering from Disney Studio's IP addresses?So with trepidation, after 2 weeks I got up the nerve to see Solo - A Star Wars Story. AND _ _ _ , I like it. It was on par with Rogue One which rates 7.8. It had a story, ties nicely into the whole Star Wars thing. It was a good action movie.So why the low attendance numbers. I think for a number of reasons. Firstly, no matter how Disney wants to pitch it, ""The Last Jedi"" took the wind out of the Star Wars genre, they almost killed the golden goose. I like many fans I have lost faith. We are frightened to come to the conclusion the goose is not only dead but they are cooking it for dinner. Secondly, the critics are feeling guilty. They are trying to get some cred back.
And thirdly, fans have to remember the universe far far away does not revolve around the Skywalkers and Jedi knights. This is an action story with blasters not light sabers. So there maybe a residual disappointment in that fact.So Disney has reaped what it has sown. They won't admit it. They will blame everything else. But maybe the low turn out to Solo may teach them to lift their game. I've now seen it, I don't love it, but it restores some of my faith. I will buy the Blu-ray. Personal choice. I will still attend ""Stars Stories"", but if Rian Johnson has anything to do with the next Star Wars movie, I ain't touching it.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

667,pasa-2,I will watch Solo 2 unlike SW9 that I blacklisted,9,24 May 2018,"In last few years Imdb scores are all over the place. Holywood keeps making movies stamped ""for imbeciles only"" where you keep telling ""what? seriously?"" every minute, and those score around 9. And his one stands at 5.6. Ridiculous. Especially comparing to that steaming pile of SW8 standing at 7.3.I am a big fan of SW from the start and read a fair amount of books beyond watching the movies. I'm not happy with most of late developments: SW7 was tolerable but caused about as much pain as joy. Rouge one was killed (for me) by awful music, and wasted so much great potential misusing the characters. And SW8 blew the fuse -- I blacklisted the remaining sequels. I considered this one ""high risk"" after the mounting problems, but decided to give it a chance. Especially as Solo is a character with rich background both in films and books, making it well is more than possible. And I liked the film. A lot, actually. The music was good all around -- I didn't look up if they would use G again, hopefully he's dropped for good and will not ruin more movies -- both the original parts and where JW themes were reused. The first 10-ish minutes I felt uneasy but then got used to Solo -- and agreed with the concept. And all the supporting actors turned out great too. While the story was not something shocking or spectacular, it was fair. And I can't recall a single 'gimme a break' moment, what is a rare precious feature these days.I read some of the reviews here and am baffled -- especially as they are all too generic, without much clue what was to hate or what they expected to see really.

It does however feel like an action/caper movie set in the Star Wars universe and that is how I am reviewing this and I am pretending that the main character isn't Han Solo.

Why did Han and Lando become friends? I would assume they have more adventures together besides this. They don't seem that close at the end of the film. Solo's love interest is lacking nearly everything as well... big mystery that she's a slave of the primary antagonist. There is nothing to be discovered in this movie... we still don't even know why 12 parsecs because it's all just explained with a cavalier shallowness and ambiguity.

671,Silent_Cal,Turn off the Lights and Save Money,7,2 June 2018,"""Solo: A Star Wars Story"" is one of the most expensive movies ever made, so obviously they had to cut corners somewhere. They chose the lights: if you watch the end credits closely, you'll notice there is no credit for lighting operators, lighting technicians, light bulbs, or anything of the sort. The result is kind of like Kubrick's movie, ""Barry Lyndon"", shot entirely by flickering candles.This makes a lot of ""Solo's"" frenetic action rather difficult to follow. All the characters dress in muddy browns and grays, and the sets are decorated in a similar fashion. The planets the crew visits to pull off their various heists are similarly drab and dusty, though I'm sure the production had to travel the world to find such locations.The story has a few twists and turns as it follows young Han Solo on his first adventures. There are many chases, an elevated train robbery, a run-in with an unfortunate space-octopus, and several shootouts. Alden Ehrenreich, filling in for Harrison Ford, is really only a convenient place-holder; the story doesn't give him much to do anyway, as it's more about the action than the character. Any old hero would have done just as well: Lando Calrissian, Nathan Fillion, Captain Kirk; they're really just variations on a theme.Come to think of it, the movie would have been little different without all the Star Wars paraphernalia. There are various gangsters and rebels competing for the macguffin -- precisely what it is hardly matters -- but the movie is really only concerned with getting its heroes from one action scene to the next. It's efficient, occasionally fun, but ultimately forgettable.Still, I guess it was worth $200 million to somebody.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

It is an epic adventure with great scenes and action and the guys who plays Han Solo and Lando both did excellent jobs. The female lead was a bit stilted but I suppose she had to be, so you can't really get a good sense of her in this movie.Han Solo could have been more of a rapscallion and a nerf herder but I guess he's not there yet.The best part of the movie is definitely the scenes themselves, they visit amazing places at amazing times and something is always happening in the background.There was a SJW type character in it who I hated in the beginning but she grew on me, once I realized she is a parody of SJWs and there wasn't too much of her. Her dialogue was tolerable, though I found her way of walking with super fat mechanical legs reminiscent of a obese woman pretty dumb.That's me nitpicking though, honestly it is a great time and I think this movie will do much better in a few years once we've all gotten the bad taste of Last Jedi out of our mouths.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

Maybe Han Solo isn't as much like the Harrison version as he could be but hey, he's younger. People change. I definitely got a Han Solo vibe in quite a few scenes.I loved the ship designs and as usual the special effects were great. The only part that felt too ""Disney"" to me was the how they basically just forced a really young person into every role they could.

678,ajwhite-99150,Give it a chance,7,28 September 2018,"I have been a Star Wars fan for as long as I can remember. I've watched everything on the big and small screens (yes, even the Christmas Special and Ewok movies), played most SW video games, read well over a hundred novels and comics, but I don't consider myself a hardcore fan or fanboy. I give credit where it is due, and feel that I can look at the franchise with both a critical and nostalgic eye. With all that said, Solo is easily the most fun SW movie since Return of the Jedi IMHO.That isn't to say that it's the ""best"" or anything, and I'm not about to hate on the other movies of the last few years, but Solo is a movie about a beloved character presented through a fairly simplistic adventure plot... kinda difficult to screw up. Although this doesn't make for a very memorable movie, it definitely had the least things that stood out to me in a negative way. Alden as Han was fine, Donald as Lando was good, and naturally the visuals were excellent. The only part of the film that I can specifically say I didn't like was Lando's droid, but she/it was just a moderate annoyance to me.So where did this movie go wrong box office-wise? Honestly, I think it was a combination of release date (shortly after Infinity War), and backlash from The Last Jedi, but that's just a guess on my part. Though this doesn't take away from the adventure theme, I for one thought it could've taken more risks with the character(s). The added scenes in the director's cut (or whatever) may help to bridge that gap, but overall it's an enjoyable film that I would recommend to SW and sci-fi fans alike , even if you didn't care for the other movies of late.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

Why didn't they cast the Hemsworth brother, be honest no one knows their first names.The film itself is also very by the numbers and generic. The plot is very lightweight and There's no real depth of story telling. The characters aren't very exciting. Donald Glover is over hyped as Lando and the droid is awful. Emilia Clarke is ok, but sleep walking. And other vets took the money and dialled in. The only thing I would say is the two leads acting does get better as the film proceeds.In terms of Han himself he is more idiot than scoundrel. There's no real shades of grey and his personality never changes.The one thing that stands out is it's nice to see imperial recruiters etc and the world under imperial law. However again it's very airbrushed in. It's not the galaxy of oppression feel you get with rogue one.Overall a lightweight film that is less disappointing than the last Jedi as it's not bad because of ego or agenda, it's just bad.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
680,Glyn-52-910242,As I expected,4,26 May 2018,"After being bitterly disappointed by The Last Jedi, I didn't hold out much hope for Solo.
Because of that, I may have gone in with my mind already in a negative mood. And if it was, the film did nothing to lift me out of that mood.
I guess we've had so much new 'Star Wars' in the last few years (some good, some horrendous) that the bits of nostalgia and nods to the original trilogy are no longer something to be excited by. They're just something we've come to expect, shoehorned in to try and appease fans or even bribe us with some bits they think we might like.It had some bits that were ok, but also some bits that were quite irritating, such as the outspoken robot that would have been more at home on a Greenpeace anti-whaling protest than on the millennium falcon.
There were lots of twists and turns and double crosses, to the point where it all got a bit tiresome trying to guess who would doublecross who next, just for the sake of trying to keep the film interesting.Not one I'll be bothering to buy or to watch again, and I'm a massive Star Wars fan.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

682,DevilPaul,Not horrible but not excellent either.,6,28 May 2018,"As a Star Wars movie this is one that you can safely wait for on DVD without really missing anything. The overall story of the movie is fine which is basically a heist film that recycles Star War tropes and set in this universe which gives a back story to our favorite rogue.Big problem with the casting though! While Donald Glover and Alden Ehrenreich are fine actors neither of them pull off Lando and Han convincingly which is a shame since there are other actors out there (I'm looking at you Anthony Ingruber) who could have performed these characters so close to the originals that we love.Paul Bettany is great as Dryden Vos but we never get the feeling that he's as sinister as most Star Wars villains and Emilia Clark plays Han's love interest but her whole story is completely confusing at the end of the movie. Lando's personal droid L3 is the most annoying part of the movie on par with Jar Jar Binks and was an awful decision on the writer's part to include in the film. If it was intended as humor it fell completely flat and just served to annoy everyone instead. There's a cameo at the end of the movie that is puzzling since the character died in a previous movie and probably would have been better served, and made more sense, by replacing him with Jabba or someone else related to the crime underworld.Honestly the film is mostly entertaining but not worth the money to take your family to the theater for.

I enjoyed the music because it is Star Wars, and I enjoyed a few of the action scenes, but it simply wasn't enough. The dialogue was chuck-full of cliches and the actor who played Solo dispalyed no charisma or charm and was generally not fun to watch.

I even liked that the origin story was quite different that I was expecting. Some homage was good for the movie but breaking canon in the end made the movie much worse for me. After reading more about where the series has gone, it fits with the new canon. Still for me, the ending took much away from the movie for me. Otherwise the movie would have gotten at least one more star. Some comical aspects also felt forced and the ""Star Wars"" theme had to be forced into the movie in some scenes. Some not so obvious references to other movies would have done the job just fine by themselves.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

I had plenty to be nervous about (with all the production scare stories), but take heart in knowing this is a faithful, tasteful story about Solo's origins. Recasting well known, and loved characters is always going to polarise opinion. I'm not sure how some can be so damning of the film, if they are a fan or otherwise. If you're a fan of the franchise, go see it, make your own judgements. Pros - good casting, good humour and great to see some scenes played out on screen, that had only been in SW lore before (story books or comics). Cons - one unnecessary scene for me, involving an alien character, and a few script moments that were pushed too hard, but hey, that could be the case of any film. Overall, I'm happy.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
692,michielodb,Better than I expected,7,22 September 2018,"Do you remember the classic Star Wars? The times where we had to wait three years before we would get a new movie, the anticipation for The Force Awakens, the excitement of getting a new trilogy,...yes I miss those days. I really like this series, I wouldn't say I'm a die hard fan but I have seen all the movies multiple times and don't really think one of them is bad, of course I do think one is better than the other. When Disney took over, I was just curious. I was a little mixed when I first saw The Force Awakens, having a hugely different tone than the original saga. I found Rogue One to be incredibly dissapointing (there I said it) and The Last Jedi is one of the most conflicted movies I have ever seen in my life (I loved some aspects, I hated other ones). Now we are having a new Star Wars movie every year and I do have to say, the magic is gone. What used to be such hyped and beloved movies are now just products coming from a conveyor belt with no magic left in them. But who are we kidding? I'ts all about money isn't it? Okay that was my little rant on Disney's take on Star Wars, now on to the review. I had very low expectations for this movie. It's the second antalogy movie and the first one was pretty bad in my opinion. After seeing the movie I have to say...it's not that bad. There were more good things about this movie than I was expecting.First of all the acting is pretty good actually, yes say what you want about Han Solo in this movie but I actually liked him. The characters are all pretty good although some of them are pretty hollow. The blossoming relation between Han and Chewie is very well done, Lando is a likeable presence and some of the new characters are also very enjoyable. The effects of course are very good but what do you expect? I was also impressed by the cinematography, I really liked how the action scenes were filmed. Last but not least, there's also a secret cameo in the movie that was very satisfying to watch!All of these things being said, this movie doesn't really feel like it has an actual plot. We go from Han Solo meeting his future friends and receiving the Falcon etc, we all like and expect to see those things but it's all helmed like those are the only things they wanted to show us. I didn't feel like this was one big movie, but more like seperate setpieces tied togheter. They wanted to show how Han became the Han Solo we know, and they do that but a movie also needs a decent plot with a beginning, middle and end. Another thing is the villain, euhm I wouldn't know who the real villain is if you'd ask me. Yes there are bad guys but none of them feel like the main antagonist so that was pretty dissapointing. Some character arcs are also very unclear and leave me with a lot of questions. Last but not least, the movie also ends pretty abruptly, but that's a minor thing.Guys, in the end this isn't a bad movie. I am probably very unpopular when I say that I enjoyed this movie more than Rogue One, but still it just feels like a product coming from a conveyor belt...that's not what Star Wars is supposed to be...I give it a 7.2/10",Solo - A Star Wars Story
693,Funsunsea,Ignore the haters and decide for yourself,5,11 September 2018,"As a Star Wars addict since the first release, so I would naturally be a critic of any SW by-product. That being said, I can happily say that Solo lived up to my expectations. Its worth the watch for entertainment value if you go along for the ride but don't expect to have your socks knocked off. The story is not that complex and kinda feels like its made up along the way, as against more complex story lines in the SW trilogy. Overall, It certainly is not worthy of less than a 5 Rating. It felt like the movie was made with budget constraints which could be why the effects were somewhat lame and the important scenes lacked significant detail which was a bit disappointing. 
Positives: Great characters and added SW entertainment which I hope we see more of in the future. 
Negatives: Acting was a bit meh and the director could have done more with the actors with a limited storyline. (they tried hard to make the most of what they were given) Some of the effects lacked technical detail, eg: interior of Millennium Falcon looked more like a cardboard mock-up and Han steering it like a car was a bit daft. That all said, Its still worth the ride - judge for yourself",Solo - A Star Wars Story
694,admcdonough,"Disappointing, But Still Enjoyed It",6,27 May 2018,"I was really looking forward to this movie and still enjoyed it despite its shortcomings. Shortcoming number one was the screenplay. To get the most out of a movie featuring the Han Solo character, you really need a script that allows Hans to be the wisecracking, cynical character as played by Harrison Ford. That doesn't happen here. The plot is not great (it jumps all over the place), but that wasn't the worst thing about the screenplay by any means. It was decent and leaves the opportunity for a sequel in good shape. The special effects weren't bad, but overall the cinematography is very poor (the movie seemed dark and murky much of the time). The soundtrack presented nothing new that was noteworthy. Some of the performances were very good. As always Paul Bettany and Woody Harrelson were great and Emilia Clarke is solid also. Chewbacca of course seemed just like he's always been. Donald Glover was a great choice for Lando Calrissian. He needed much more screen time than the actor who played Han Solo. That unfortunately gets to the major reason for my disappointment with the film. Alden Ehrenreich was an uninspired choice to play Han and can't carry it off. It's always difficult to follow in the footsteps of someone who completely nails a character and Alden wasn't helped by lackluster dialogue that was supplied, but he just doesn't have the presence to carry the role off. With better casting of Han Solo and better dialogue written for him, this could really have been good. But unfortunately given the script, cinematography and casting problems this film falls far short of what it should have been.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

Don't get me wrong - I am Star Wars fan - since 1989/90 when I was old enough to watch the first movies. And I've watched them a lot.But in the last few years all that Star Wars turned into - is a money maker, empty of content.

696,murrayspeer,"Good fun, but some problems",8,5 November 2019,"Not bad overall, but several things I didn't like about it.It felt more like a set-up for future movies than a story of its own.I think Alden was miscast as Solo - I wasn't confident when it was announced but I was willing to give him a chance. He's a fine leading man but his physicality and performance didn't say Solo to me.There was no real tension or suspense to the story, and the various double-crossings got tiresome because nothing was really at stake. The point where narrative depth was supposed to emerge falls flat because we're told about it instead of shown.Finally, there's a troubling ambiguity to the outcome of the big card game at the end because of what Lando has gone through, that isn't acknowledged at all.GIVEN ALL THAT: I enjoyed it and it's well filmed and well acted. 8/10",Solo - A Star Wars Story

Alden Ehrenreich makes a great young Han, and Troy from Community makes a great Lando (yes, the name is LandO, as in Land-O-Lakes, not Landau as in Martin). The supporting cast was supportive, if not interchangeable, and Daenerys Targaryen always brightens up a room. If you grew up playing with Star Wars figures and imagining your own early adventures of Han Solo, you'll be happy to see one of those childhood memories brought to life. Ron Howard's direction was near expert, the story was swindle after swindle, sprinkled with easter eggs and enough swashbuckling to make it a Han origin story worth your time and money...Cause let's face it.. we are never going to get Saving Private Skywalker, and we are a long ways from a KOTOR movie, so like anything in life it's really about managing your expectations. If you want to see a fun movie that mines your nostalgia and is fun to watch with your own jaded and hypercritical kids (which is what most of these reviewers sound like honestly) then you won't be disappointed.

You can't do any of that when you know the ending of the story and even if you could, you are severely hamstring by the very fact of being a prequel. There's only so many things you can change.Solo, inherently is at a disadvantage where the above is concern since we know how his story ends. Some people may say it's the journey that matters and not the end, if we are honest with ourselves we know that's absolute BS, it's why we have a check box for spoilers for this very review you're reading, if the journey is all that matters then spoilers doesn't matter.

703,douglasmiller-84793,I hated it less than The Last Jedi...,5,6 June 2018,"As much as this movie is likeable as a decent action film, and it's technically sound, it checks plenty of boxes except the most important ones.The film opens with a derivative James Bond style opening. Our swashbuckling hero is improvising his escape from the bad guy, or guys. He needs no introduction, because we all know him. The expository text gives us the lay of the land, but it's totally not necessary. We accept it in Star Wars movies, and it made sense in the originals, but not so much here. It's become a crutch for the directors and a replacement for good storytelling.Ron Howard goes through his checklist and tries to give us a scene for every old reference. Chewie, pull somebody's arms off please (check). Show us the Kessel Run (check). Have Han shoot first (check), etc. But where the film falls utterly flat is in the main character. As far as Han Solo goes, he's the same guy at the end of the movie as he was at the beginning. There's simply no character growth. And in an origin story movie (where we all know the lead can't die) there's zero suspense. We're not invested in the character's success because the ending was assured. I'm no writer, but if we saw Han Solo BECOME the person we know, that would be different. If we saw him suffer tragedy and lose his optimism, THAT would be worth seeing. If we saw him starting out as somewhat timid, but finding his courage, THAT would be a movie worth watching. But, we saw none of those things. And it begs he question, ""Why see this movie at all?"" Contrast it with Rogue One where we saw the lead grow into a woman and take on the Empire. She grew to take on a role that was greater than her own life. Han Solo managed to win a card game. His character arc is totally flat. And ultimately, the movie is simply forgettable.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
704,mjsmjs-46362,"better get used to these, this is the future of SW",6,25 May 2018,"I challenge anybody to name a movie character that is more closely tied with actor who potrayed him or her than Han Solo. With the possible exception of Indiana Jones, there probably isn't anybody higher on the list. This fact alone made making a movie with a different actor potraying the iconic and perhaps most beloved Star Wars character of all time a risky and ill conceived idea to begin with. Disney did it for one major reason, making money. Like it or not, you can't blame them for doing that, they paid a large sum of money to buy Lucasfilm and the Star Wars brand, obviously they want it to be profitable. Solo is a good glimpse into the future of Star Wars movies. One message I got loud and clear from this movie is that there will be more...many, many more spinoff, backstory, and side story films to come from this franchise.Having said that...I found the movie to be entertaining and well thought out. The story is easy to follow, it's suprisingly very well cast and written, and the cringe-worthy ""noooooo"" moments we've all come to expect from Star Wars movies were pleasantly infrequent and minor, save for one doozie of a scene late in the movie ( those of you reading this who have already seen the movie know exactly what I'm talking about, and know exactly what that scene commnicates about the future of the franchise). It's become nearly impossible to view new Star Wars movies without comparing them to others in the franchise, this will continue to be a problem for Disney. Honestly, I liked it much better than The Last Jedi, (which I felt was an absolutely wretched film, both in the context of Star Wars and on its own merits). Solo has the Star Wars feel the fans demand that was completely missing from The Last Jedi. More importantly, it stayed reasonably true to the characters and story, and didn't demolish them like the previous Disney installment managed to. The younger Han Solo potrayed here doesn't do anything that isn't what you'd expect the character to do...I can safely watch the original trilogy without having a bunch of images that were planted in my head ruining the original character. No hand milking of aliens in this movie, thank God.Don't believe the negativity prior to the release, Alden Ehrenreich does a fine job potraying Han Solo. He doesn't come across as a Harrison Ford impersonator at all, his delivery is smooth and natural, and he brings a believability to the character I was pleasantly suprised with. Donald Glover delivered well as Lando, and Emilia Clarke did a great job as well. Woody Harrelson was the big suprise for me however, he nailed his character perfectly and dominated every scene he was in.Overall I found this to be a competent and entertaining movie, I left the theatre with a much better feeling than I did after enduring the horrific dumpster fire that was The Last Jedi. It's roughly on par with Rogue One, if I were to try to equate it to one of the existing films.

705,loganjhanselman,It was more of a generic sci-fi movie than a Star Wars movie,7,7 July 2018,"WARNING: SPOILER ALERT FOR SOLO, but you're probably not missing out on much. Let's start from the production: Christopher Lord and Phil Miller were originally set to direct before being let go due to creative differences. Then, in came Oscar-winning director Ron Howard, who reshot 80% of the movie. Alden Ehrenreich was cast as the titular character, and he... was definitely the wrong choice. He was picked out of 2,500 other actors, and he blew it. He didn't look like Harrison Ford, nor did he have the mannerisms to be a proper Han Solo. Donald Glover was the only one who looked like the character he was supposed to play.The tone was just too gritty, and I found myself saying ""lighten up, will ya?"". The surprise Darth Maul cameo definitely took me by surprise, but when I saw him, I was like ""Hey, it's Red Skull"", who appeared in Avengers: Infinity War one month prior. Finally, the ending was apparently supposed to set up sequels to this, and due to the ""success"" now I know they're probably not happening anytime soon, if at all.

715,mistramicizia,Action-packed film with some questions remaining unanswered...,7,29 June 2018,"As somebody who could be considered a follower (not exactly a fan) of Star Wars franchise, I find this movie to be one of the worse among them. The movie itself, neglecting everything that precedes or succeeds it, was rather entertaining with some characters that are memorable. However, watching this movie I felt that it loses track and acts as a movie for itself, which would be okay if it wasn't for the fact that Han Solo depicted in A New Hope (1977) didn't appear in my eyes somewhat different from one portrayed here (and I'm not just talking about physical appearance, but rather his inner character), as well as the whole atmosphere in the movie which felt weird and not Star Wars-like, in a way. This movie is just fun, and if you expect something deep and refreshing, well, you might find yourself disappointed.DISCLAIMER : Everything stated in this review is entirely matter of personal opinion and doesn't have to coincide with the opinions of other reviewers",Solo - A Star Wars Story

You would expect a good movie with Ron Howard directing and with such names as Woody Harrelson, Emilia Clarke, Paul Bethany or Thandie Newton but no. It is just an average action movie and despite their history you do not feel attached to the characters. At least you think, there must be some good CGI? For some reason, most of the movie is dark, I mean the image is dark-gray. There just isn't enough light to see what is happening in most of the the action scenes.
So, another boring disappointment from the Star Wars franchise. What else? Oh, yeah, political correctness with... robots.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
718,brunettevtx,"Good, not great",6,1 January 2021,"If you're a Star Wars fan you should be entertained enough by it. It's not a complete bomb and a lot of names fill out the cast. Alden Ehrenreich looks like a younger version of Harrison Ford's Han Solo (facial structure, eye color) and has that swaggering, smart-alecky attitude that the character always embodied. The train heist scene is a bit too long, maybe two minutes shorter would have been ideal, and losing two characters during this sequence seemed a bit too soon.
Also L3 is an advocate for ""droid rights"", which is a little eye-rolling. But it's nice to see some of Han's backstory: how he meets Chewbacca, how he meets Lando, and how he acquires the Falcon.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
719,mbfernandez-29516,"Entertaining and fun, but nothing else...",6,7 January 2021,"This movie had a very difficult product, with a lot of reshoots and a fast Post-Production.
I think the casting is good, all of them do a great job, specially Donald Glover and Emilia Clarke... I think that all that nice characters eclipse Alden Ehrenreich, he's a good actor and makes an acceptable work, but Han Solo is to big for him. Also, Woody Harrelson makes an fantastic job.The movie is narratively well made, it has a fast rhythm with a lot of action, basically the movie tells us all the anecdotes of Han Solo's past that we heard in the Original movies. But where's the problem...? He isn't Han Solo, he tries it, but nobody can be Han Solo that isn't Harrison Ford. I also think that the movie let's no time to develope all this interesting characters. The direction is conventional but effective, nothing exceptional and the Cinematography could have been better, the color palette is unstable and there's nothing special. Like in all the modern Star Wars films the VFX are incredible and the OST this time by John Powell is exceptional and gives a nice smuggler and dark atmosphere to the movie.One of the biggest problem of the movie is the central plot, it's like a list of things that should be told about Han Solo's past, but all this has to be guided by a central plot, that I think is very weak. Also the ending of the movie, all the third act is strange and it seams anti-climatic.In conclusion it's a well made movie, but it isn't exceptional and I think it was unnecessary. It's entertaining but nothing else...
(That end with Darth Maul is pure Fan Service, but it's so great...!)",Solo - A Star Wars Story
720,brennandube,"Solo is a bit more than ""so-so"" but still feels forgettable",7,26 May 2018,"I can safely say Ehrenreich played the part justice and offers fans a safe and charming portrayal of 'Han Solo.' I say safe because this movie did not feel the need to take risks, it was quite a basic plot driven film that did not add much to the overall 'Star Wars' universe... we will get into that a bit later. Alden Ehrenreich was not the only individual who took the leap and portrayed a famous character from the past, Donald Glover plays 'Lando Calrissian' and he also did an adequate job at playing this role. When Glover and Ehrenreich have scenes of interaction this movie is at its best. They have a few moments in this film that are simple yet special and quite entertaining to watch. Woody Harrelson is also in this film and he plays a mentor-ish individual who is the leader of the group. Harrelson offers a good performance as always, quite the actor who never fails to impress. I quite enjoyed the story arc between Harrelson's character and 'Han' as in the past we have never seen Mr. Solo have to be in a position where he is under someone's wing. Paul Bettany is in this film as well, he plays the role of our villain and his performance as 'Dryden Vos' is great. One gripe I have about his character though is I feel he is underused. His performance on screen was quite well done and he provided that feel of a menacing vibe whenever he was in the room. This is a feeling that overall I felt was missing from 'Solo' and would have enhanced the film quite a bit. Special effects in this movie are stunning and it is quite clear that this franchise will not settle for second best when coming to visuals and CGI. Certain chase scenes early on in this film look very clean and crisp and offer good sequences of action. That train scene that is shown in every commercial is as awesome on screen as it is in the trailers. The sequence is an incredible piece of action and was definitely the high of this movie action wise. Other than that, 'Solo' fell flat. Home from the theatre now I can almost recount zero other action sequences that stood out to me.  The opening third of this movie holds its intrigue and stands strong, then we hit the middle third. The middle third of this movie was slow, choppy, silly and boring. It dragged on far too long and felt rather filler. I felt optimistic after what the first third of this film had to offer, just to be disappointed by a rather annoying middle chunk. Deep into the second act of 'Solo' things happen that are just plain stupid. Without giving up too much I felt this movie would have been much more enjoyable without a certain droid...you'll know. The final third of this movie got back on track for the most part. Also, expect references... a lot of references. Personally, I am a fan of nostalgia, but in 'Solo' you feel like you are being force fed things just for fanfare. Sure, we get to learn how 'Han' becomes 'Han Solo', and sure we learn how him and 'Chewbacca' meet and yes, we also learn how the 'Millennium Falcon' becomes Han's, but it was not interesting and those moments didn't feel magical like they should have. 
In the end 'Solo' feels plain. It did not offer much to the 'Star Wars' universe and it stayed its course, not taking too many risks or jumps. 'Solo' was driven by a tasteless plot that had predictable outcomes. If you are a casual movie goer you might find enjoyable fun in this space western. Big props to John Powell and John Williams for creating a great soundtrack. Williams is often taken for granted now due to being so damn good at what he does, but him and Powell did a great job at bringing this movie to life with the music.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

Nothing... absolutely nothing created in the Star Wars universe since the original trilogy has raised that bar. I don't believe that anything ever will or ever should be expected to. Sorry, I needed to get that out of the way.On it's own merit, I feel that Solo does a fair job of introducing us to some familiar and new characters in the Star Wars universe. It's both fun and shallow, just like Han himself. There aren't any breakthroughs here and much of the story is very much contrived to hurry us along like tourists on a Hollywood bus tour. But if you want your nostalgia nerves to tingle just a little bit and enjoy a simple action adventure, Solo was a pretty good effort, particularly from the cast who did a commendable job.I was disappointed in how the drama surrounding the making of the movie and pressure from corporate probably did have a negative impact on the overall development. We could have gotten a better movie, but it also could have been much worse (it could have been Rogue One!).",Solo - A Star Wars Story
724,Sir Gerry,"Not good nor terrible, just mediocre.",5,27 May 2018,"Excellent movie if you have ADS and are into new movies, you know, those generic, all look-the-same feel-the-same-movies. Switch the characters for those of Guardians of the Galaxy and the effect is exactly the same. While it was well directed and put together, it suffers from predictable plot, generic action (except for a couple of sequences) and very boring acting in general. Alden is not a bad actor but c'mon, we all knew Ford's shoes are really hard to fill, and almost impossible in the case of Han Solo. The character is so powerful, it defined and almost typecast Ford's career. The villain here is so generic, ""I get aroused when I kill"" James Bond mean guy. We also have, of course, yet another posh girl that even looks a lot like Felicity Jones, easily defeating 6 foot men and all. The feminist (droidist?) copilot is rather insufferable, very out of place, it's meant to be funny but it is certainly not. The sexual innuendo ""she"" plays with Lando is just too much for Star Wars. Then of course is the fact that Lucasfilm has decided to checklist every minutia from the OT, so Han is given his surname in an unceremonious and rushed fashion by an imperial agent, he gets his blaster from Beckett and the ship from Lando. Talk about the deconstruction of the Alpha-Male of the OT. Then the ridiculous but very progressive idea that one of the toughest characters is a 16 year old girl, because they can do everything, right? Even command pirates and raiders. Then comes the subject of cinematography. Enough with the dark movies, enough. Go watch the OT and what made it feel like it is another planet. The new movies suffer from the gray, unsaturated, Netflix-show syndrome, it is depressing (hence, it's for millennials) Disney thinks that hiring Oscar winning cinematographers will give these movies a touch of je ne sais quoi, but no, it just makes them harder to look at. Then comes the final cameo, which by all means is just Disney trying to do fan service full blown. There's no reason for it, no meaning behind it, it messes continuity and future movies, and I love Darth Maul, but this was just awful. you can't ask SW fans to leave their brains at the theater door, we are much more intelligent and discerning than that, and as it gets harder to get people to theaters, Lucasfilm and all the SJW working there really have to try harder if they want my hard earned cash.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

726,DearIMDB,Riposte to the Fan Boy Haters,8,25 September 2018,"Lets face it, trying to recreate the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel (Sistine Chapel 2 - This Time Its Personal) is a pointless exercise. You have to move on and try new stuff. Well Lucas tried several new ideas with every incarnation of the Franchise and got it wrong a few times that we'd all like to forget, ""Meesa thinking yousa talk about me, okiday?"" However this was a pre-prequal with a clean slate to produce a whole new back story image we could slot into our already slightly muddled collection of ""Back to the Future"" Star Wars episodic sequels. Now despite the allegedly poor box office receipts - I think the title didn't help, which was a bit ""fairy story"" and lacking imagination - I suspect it might do well in the long run with word of mouth. I for one was a teen when they launched the original which was new, different and very exciting offering a whole new level to the imagination. That time has long since passed and with CGI, nothing is left to the imagination today. So the special effects are special but the story is the thing and I was both surprised and enthralled by the young Solo and his girlfriend and the speed at which the action took off. I always wondered about Solo's beginnings. It was fast, filled with danger and desperation and speed as it kicked off at a pace never slowed giving us action which lasted for a long time with breath taking imagery and cliff hanging suspense. Ron Howard had to let up a couple of times to allow us to regroup but there were some great twists and turns and lots of complex looking technology. Don't be put off by the fanatical Sheldon Cooper like Fan Boys. Kids for sure will love it though they may wriggle a bit at the bits with detailed dialogue, but it is necessary to the plot line. There is loads of breath taking action, near misses, weird and wonderful aliens and characters. I loved every minute of it. Woody Harrelson gave his usual good performance and so did Alden Ehrenreich who played Solo. Lovely Emilia Clarke who played Qi'ra (without a Dragon in sight) showed her romantic & devious side. Donald Glover was a hot handsome, treacherous Lando Calrissian. I loved best how Chewbacca played by Joonas Suotamo came into the saga and it made a change to have no R2D2 or C3PO but plenty of other automated furniture! Yep it kept me enthralled which I hadn't expected, which I believe was down to great direction by Ron Howard and sharp editing! I will watch it again!",Solo - A Star Wars Story

Went with my lowest expectations into the theatre accompanied by a fellow SW purist... and we were both equally pleasantly surprised!!! I get some of the criticisms but this is NOT bad movie, in fact it's actually quite heartwarming after all that mud we've been dragged through. I love Han Solo and I enjoyed getting a little taste of the back story as well as getting to see other sides of familiar characters like Chewie and Lando. Go see this film.

To complain that the movie includes references to Star Wars episodes is totally besides the point. Who would like a James Bond movie without the familiar parts? To complain about the acting is also strange. This is NOT Hamlet, and was Mark Hamill really a reincarnation of Laurence Olivier in the first place??
I even think (and I know that this is close to a sacrilege) that Alden Ehrenreich is a very believable Han Solo. The visual style is great, the space ships also look almost ""authentic"" - much more metal, less CG. The story is just about right (did people complain about Hitchcock's ""McGuffins""?) and the only things I did not like are not really that important like Emilia Clarke's hair (so 70s - just because Episode I came out in 1977??).",Solo - A Star Wars Story
732,Melvin_Tigerfists,When Very Good Is Not Good Enough,6,18 June 2018,"Solo: A Star Wars Story is a very good movie. Ron Howard did a very good job of delivering a competent and polished film from what was reportedly a production disaster. The kid whose name I can't remember did a very good job of playing a young Han Solo. The film did a very good job of making connections with the Star Wars universe and answering questions about origins.Very good. Very ordinary. Which is heartbreaking.Not all Star Wars films have been very good... parts of them have been downright embarassing, they have been uneven, and they have been infuriating. But they have never, EVER been ordinary. I read that Lucas already had this film in development when Disney bought the franchise. I don't know what he would have produced... I suspect it would have made everyone mad for different reasons, but it would not have been ordinary. The Phantom Menace SUCKED, but I went to see it three times, because it was not ordinary.Two things had to be true about this film in order to justify its existence:First, the actor who stepped into Harrison Ford's shoes had to be freaking amazing... a force of nature. When we first encountered Ford as Solo, he was radiating attitude. As soon as I saw him as a kid, I wanted to BE him, not that whiny Luke Skywalker. You liked him, but you didn't know if you could trust him. You liked him anyway. When he was winging it and taking chances, he really sold it. You really believed he was endangering himself and everyone else. He was a rebel and acted like he wanted to be left alone, but was still irrepressible. That's 100% Harrison Ford, not the script or the direction. If you can't duplicate that level of presence, just don't go there. I'm sure Lucasfilm knew that. I'm sure they thought they had a winner. But the actor was only very good, which is an insult to the legacy of Han Solo.Second, the movie had to make you want more. More movies, more stories, more Han Solo. More Star Wars. This film made me want less. Less of this kind of Star Wars film, anyway.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

736,gerick_goldwyn,***THIS IS WHY SW IS FAILING - LISTEN UP DISNEY***,3,16 September 2018,"I'm so glad I didn't see this film at the movies. What an all-out idiotic film. It was nothing more than one long action screen with no storyline; I could compare it to a poorly written western movie. Initially, I stayed away from this film because I didn't think Alden Ehrenreich was up to the task of playing Han Solo, and although he played his part beautifully, he didn't at any point throughout the movie give off the Harrison Ford or Han Solo vibe. Whoever cast this film cost Disney hundreds of millions of dollars!I am also getting a bit sick and tired of Disney's new take on SW. There completely stuck in the Empire Era and forever talking about the dam ""spark"" or ""rebirth"" of the Rebellion; being SW Rebels, Rogue One, the Last Jedi or Solo, and Disney wonders why SW is failing - it's simple - because it only has one soundtrack. I don't want to hear about the dam ""spark"" or ""rebirth"" of the Rebellion every time I turn on SW. When the marauder (or Cloud-Rider), Enfys Nest, removed her helmet in Solo and said she was Rebellion, I wanted to hit head against the wall... And, again, how many SW films can Disney make based during the Empire Era and keep people coming back to the movies? Even SW episodes VII to IX are reboots of episodes IV to VI. If Disney had any brains at all, they would start churning out movies based before and during the Clone Wars; given they have completely ruined episodes VII to IX. The time before and during the Clone Wars is absolutely awesome! Both the Jedi and the Sith in their prime, great characters like Yoda, Obi-Wan Kenobi, Anakin Skywalker and Darth Sidious back into the mix... Even Ahsoka Tano kicks ass in SW the Clone Wars. That's the X-Factor SW is missing... Marvel has heaps of awesome characters (Ironman, Captain America, Thor, Spiderman, the Black Panther, and the list goes on) and who does SW episodes VII to IX have? No one. There all boring characters! You might also notice, Disney recently cancelled SW Rebel, which is based during the Empire Era, and are currently bring back SW the Clone Wars because (the majority of) SW Rebels was just drivel compared to SW the Clone Wars, and was only able to survive for four season in the first place because in season 2, they brought back the characters from SW the Clone Wars, i.e., Ahsoka Tano, Darth Maul, Cody, etc., which made it worth watching again. Whoever wrote episodes VII to IX should be fired! Disney should have released a new trilogy simular to the SWTOR Cinematic Trailer: Return; a new Jedi Order, the return of the Empire, and some super cool Jedi and Sith Lords back into the mix. Instead, we're stuck with duds like Kylo Ren and grumpy old men like Luke Skywalker. It doesn't inspire much faith in the future, does it? I want to see some super cool Sith Lords, Jedi, and some kick-ass Force powers... This is what makes SW great!!! All we have seen so far is Kylo Ren, who's an absolute joke; bested by a girl who had never even held a lightsabre before. Anyone of one thousand Sith or Jedi could have easily killed him with a single swing of their lightsabre and picked their teeth with his bones, and he's the next Vader - pathetic!!!! I mean, we're supposed to believe that Kylo Ren destroyed the new Jedi Order when he couldn't even defeat a single force-sensitive girl with no Jedi training of any kind? Who wrote this rubbish? You don't bring down the Avengers and the Justice League, only to be brought down by Smurfette... Perhaps Kylo Ren better call for reinforcements before he faces another defenceless young girl (or Jedi novice)? Useless!!!! I was also hoping that Ezra Bridger would turn out to be Supreme Leader Snoke, but I was disappointed on that front too; it could have kept SW Rebels going for another few more seasons.What Disney fails to grasp is: SW is the Jedi, the Sith, and the Force itself. It's not the Skywalker line, the Empire, the Rebellion, or the endless production of stupid Death Stars they refuse to walk away from, or even the original SW cast or characters. I'll say again: it's the Jedi, the Sith and the Force. So far we have seen four Disney SW films, which don't even include these three things really. Instead we're following around storm troopers, resistance pilots and smugglers, and next (probably) it will be a damn bounty hunter. Awesome. These movies should be the absolute bottom, BOTTOM of the barrel. Tell me, what's the point of visiting a galaxy far, far away without the Jedi, the Sith or the Force even in it? Does that even sound like SW to you? It doesn't to me. Why even visit? It's the equivalent of making a Planet of the Apes movie without the apes... Disney was even stupid enough to kill off the Jedi and the Sith in the Last Jedi too (I think the quote was: ""It's time to let old things die. The Sith... the Jedi, the Rebels...let it all die!"") and completely destroyed the Jedi's legacy in the process. The Jedi could have easily been rebranded as heroes again but instead, their rebranded as cowards: when the galaxy really, really needs them, where are? Luke Skywalker is hiding on Ahch-To with his tail between his legs. Just like Yoda and Obi-Wan Kenobi after the Clone Wars. It was their decisions that lead to the fall of the Jedi Order and the Republic, but where are they after SW episode III? Living in exile while the survivors of Order 66 were being exterminated across the galaxy.... This is who the Jedi are now: wimps and losers. The Jedi were once the coolest fictional characters in the world, and now there've lost all their awesomeness - it's just pathetic!!!!",Solo - A Star Wars Story

It' the story of a scoundrel, a thief and a betrayed person. So it does justice to the spirit o Han that the original saga built.The casting , wich i had some doubts, proved to be solid, Alden Ehrenreich delivers a credible Han Solo, wich could have been easily ruined. Not only you believe (after the initial realization that Harrison Ford is no longer around) the character, but i felt confortable with this new face of the iconic character.The mixture of genre (western, noir, adventure) it's not forced or pushed, and serve the story. To the fans, it's explains almost every item (what do you expect after 40 years and 8 movies??), but with respect y proper treatment of it's aspects.So, while it's not a groundbreaking story with a new universe of posibilities, it's the story (in my opinion) that makes justices to a character , gives a background, and gives you something unique: entertainment AND fun.How many movies lately, had give you joy? 
And, foremost, when i left the theater, that feeling does not disappeared , and it did left me with something. It's not a fade away movie.

It's not an elaborate story compared to the other Star Wars, but it is a good origin story for people to know more about Han.On the actors -- I am amazed how the young Han talks and acts like Harrison Ford.

The action is reasonably well done but that's about all the film has going for it. Finally, as has become customary now from Lucasfilm under Kathleen Kennedy, the film is full of SJW politics with no attempt to make it subtle.Not worth your time, even if you are a die-hard Star Wars fan.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

I love the whole Star Wars saga so I hoped this one wouldn't bring it all down. But to my surprise it was really good. A lot of people were confused about the ending. Darth Maul didn't die in Star Wars I. He fell all the way down, along with his legs detached. Of course, most people thought Obi Wan killed him. However that is not true. So yes this takes place after episode 3 and before episode 4. When Maul landed on the ground with metal legs he saw his brother which was the first person he'd seen in a long time. Yes he got metal legs. That is pretty much how the ending is explained. It is how he is still alive.

744,anunknownfred,Fun Movie,10,31 December 2018,I loved Solo like I love all the star wars movies and I am pleased to say even though it is a story we probably didn't need it was an amazing movie and really enjoyable! Alden Ehrenreich was a perfect choice to play Han as he brought new things to the character whilst still feeling a lot like Han. The story was very interesting and the suprise of Maul at the end was done perfectly! I recommend this to any big star wars original trilogy fans as it was constantly reminding me of them.,Solo - A Star Wars Story
745,charliejsch,There is no character consistency,5,26 May 2018,"I don't know what they have been doing to Star Wars the last few movies. The story is bland and has no mystery, magic, awe or intrigue. From the very get go, there were action scenes without context. In fact, most of the fight scenes felt as though there aws no meaning behind them. I couldn't care less who wins or loses. I'm a massive Star Wars fan, therefore, this why I care. While watching this in the cinema, I was thinking: what would I think of this movie if I've never seen Star Wars? I would think this movie is complete garbage. Who are these characters and why do they matter? There is no explanation nor character consistency.The romantic story arc has no meaning, at all, even though it takes precedent througout the entire movie! She decided she didn't want to be with him even though they love each other and she used his memory to help her get through the tough times. When they finally re-unite, it's formal and awkward, as if they just don't care anymore. Han Solo's decisions make no sense because we're never really introduced to his character and the writers don't give a crap. They're both bland.None of this makes sense other than to make a cash grab movie and fill it with fluff. The robot, the new character I enjoyed, dies and Lando valiantly goes to rescue her. However, a second later he's pulling out her brain and putting her into the ship. WHAT? Where did that meaningful rescue go and did it mean anything? Nope.Beckket loses all his crewmates and does not bat an eye. Rather, he gives a punch and the writers want to move away from this as fast as possible. The raiders suddenly become the good guys, because, of course they do... Not only that, but they have to choose innocent looking teenagers straight from savage raiders.In the first 6 movies, all the characters are consistent and the theme revolves around being tenacious for those you care about. Luke was willing to sacrifice himself to save his father and friends. Princess Laia would do anything for her people and friends. Anakin would, literally, do anything for Padme(even turn to the dark side). Solo finds a cause and person willing to fight for. HOWEVER, in all these new movies, everyone seems to have this obtuse and non-effort attitude towards anyone they care about. In Solo, him and everyone he meets just shrug off any attachments they have formed. I mean, really? Any attachments between the characters are valueless, therefore, this movie has no value.There are some nice moments in the movie. For instance, the interaction between Han and Chewbacca. The second gambling match between Han and Lando. However, these are far and few between. Solo is just disappointing. No one in it feels like a real person. I feel as though this is for 5 year olds because of its flashy effects and pew pew.I'm sorry what happened to you, Star Wars.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

The other episodes tended to be dour and dark whereas this installment was the opposite. The original (older) Han Solo was confident, cocky and was quick with a quip. This prequel was in the same vein. This young Solo showed his mettle and daring that led to the Solo of the future. Ron Howard let the story revolve around dialogue and characters - and didn't rely on an overuse of CGI.

Love is lost while trying to escape a place, outlaws meet outlaws, trainheist, get a job by mainoutlaw to finish another and so on. Things we've seen many times.Well it is true, without Star Wars and Solo it would be a more normal movie not many people would take notice of it. But!

Thin plot, claustrophobic sets, no depth to characters (with one exception) and little connection to the later Han Solo: it would take a decent actor to do that, and we didn't have one. But Thandie Newton was gorgeous, Donald Glover even more so (imagine a black Howard Keel) and Woody Harrelson put everyone to shame. But that fine actor did get the best lines. And Imax 3D was very convincing. It was OK if you don't expect anything much, we're not in Bladerunner territory here.

It was mostly ok, much better than the ""new trilogy movies"". But it was also totally not necessary. We did not need an origin movie for Han Solo and this movie did not succeed in justifying its existence. Worse, it undermined the character. I am not speaking about how he got his name, that was lame but very small. I am speaking about making him a hero and a good guy and a friend of the rebellion already. Han Solo was not a good guy at the beginning of Star Wars. He had a good heart and joined the good guys at the end but he needed to change to do it.

757,werlingjakob,"Solo: A Star Wars Story is a Flawed, Yet Solid and Action-Packed Addition to the Star Wars Canon!",7,30 May 2018,"If you wanted to, you could watch pretty much every original Star Wars movie and after doing so, you could probably agree with my point that they leave A LOT of questions unanswered! And that is why we have all of the prequel movies and Star Wars Story movies. Believe me when I say that we still have a lot of stories to uncover, with important characters like Princess Leia, Boba Fett, and Obi-Wan-Kenobi- but at least now Han Solo's story is fully uncovered and the uncovered story that we watched unfold before our very eyes made for a decent movie. Don't get me wrong, Solo does have its flaws, but it also has a lot of great things going for it as well. The story is even, even though it does somewhat leave too many questions to be answered (just go and see the movies and then you will see what I mean), though it is full of great moments. Such as the Millennium Falcon escaping both a space creature and a black hole, a bunch of robots fighting for equal rights, and a genuinely touching moment involving people that seem to be space pirates. The story also answers pretty much every question that we've ever had about Han Solo, so that is also nice. Solo's constant twists and double-crosses were a nice new addition, but they were both a blessing and a curse. The first few were pretty good and shocking, but it got kind of old by the end (though the Darth Maul cameo was the most best and shocking of them all). Alden Ehrenreich does a great job in the role of Han while Woody Harrelson, Emilia Clarke, Donald Grover, and- yes, the guy who plays Chewbacca Joonas Suotamo are equally as great in the supporting roles of Beckett, Qi'ra, Lando, and Chewbacca. Whoever played the droid was probably the most funniest though. The special effects and set pieces were obviously great, as well as the movie's musical score- though it didn't really do anything new for the series. The action sequences were great. And since Solo isn't as big on Stormtroopers and the whole Jedi & Sith thing, it's able to be creative with its action. This is why we see both sword fights and just all-out skirmishes in the movie. And, in my opinion, I think it is a welcome addition and something fresh because all we usually get are Lightsaber battles and space battles. The movie also is able to create lots of funny, touching, and surprising moments due to the fact that it is exploring mostly unexplored territory. Ron Howard also did a respectable job of directing the movie too. And in the end, Solo: A Star Wars Story does end up having flaws (specifically all of the questions that turn up in the plot but are answered, the somewhat generic territory it sometimes enters, and the fact that it doesn't always bring lots of new stuff to Star Wars mythos). But overall, Solo: A Star Wars Story is a good movie with a mostly-satisfying plot with some good twists, great performances, nice moments, and fresh action sequences that manage to break into new territory for Star Wars as a whole. And it proves that Star Wars Story movies are just as important as main cannon entries. Star Wars fans need to see it!",Solo - A Star Wars Story

759,battlecrusadersgames,Much better than Rogue one,8,29 May 2018,"Here is the latest in the line of Star wars spin-offs and in case you are wondering, it fits between Episodes 3 + 4, which may be hard to keep track of, but for fans, it's fair enough, especially given it gives us background on two of our favourite star wars characters.
 This time round, we follow the young Han Solo, before he got mixed up with the Empire, the Rebellion or even Jabba the Hutt. Here he meets Chewbacca for the first time, but there are many other character encounters that he goes through during the movie. The plot mainly focusing on Han and co getting their hands on a rare fuel, to gain money for a ship and to pay off a debt to a villain.
 In terms of action, this movie has it all, chases, duels, gun-fights dog-fights, there's literally action almost the whole way through, and yet, it never gets boring.
 What really makes this a joy though, are the special FX which are groundbreaking. As you fly through with the Millennium Falcon, you almost feel as if you-re right there with the hero's. Even the green screen moments are so seamless, it's hard to tel what's real and what's CGI.
 If i have any gripes it's that the movie is a little long and although or lead shows promise, he's no Harrison Ford, but if you enjoy this as a stand alone film, it's extremely entertaining, even if you haven't seen all the other Star wars films and it's wayyy better than Rogue one.

It has a great classic Sci-fi adventure feel to it and the score real helps to sell that.

762,kfss264,"Great heist movie, and back history of Han Solo",8,11 June 2018,"There were a couple little things I didn't like, but they were very minor to the overall movie and story. In Solo we get to see the events that shape Han into the roguish pirate we first met in A New Hope. The story in Solo departed somewhat from Han's back story many of us read about in the EU/Legends, but that was expected as Disney cast away the EU history and lore.Solo was a fast paced action heist movie that was fun to watch. I particularly liked Woody Harelson's character, which I was initially concerned about. The Millenium Falcon story was a fun ride as well. I lost track of how many nods/Easter eggs there were to EU/Legends lore and cannon throughout the movie, but they did a good job of weaving them into the movie.The surprise cameo at the end of the movie was another nod to cannon. Those who think/claim it dates the movie to the prequel era, obviously have not followed all of the cannon. This movie is set squarely between the prequel era (Revenge of the Sith), and the original trilogy (A New Hope), where we would expect it to be.Don't let last years Last Jedi dissuade you from seeing this fun movie.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
763,Fifth_of_November,Hope this is not a solo episode! Among the best Star Wars,7,7 June 2018,"Thank you Ron Howard, what a satisfaction this was. As a long-time fan going back to the 80's, I thought ""Solo"" is very close to how Star Wars movies should be made. This time, and quite unlike the prequel trilogy by Lucas, they really nailed the image and picture. Very reminescent of the old Star Wars movies, old-school look, while being of its time altogether. Great job.Script made for an interesting plot and story, although one could wish it would have allowed for some more character origin development as unfortunately, action is really non-stop. This is the main negative to this movie. Non-stop action provides pace but this is usually done at the expense of character development and climax buildup. Must admit that this is how all movies are made nowadays it seems, and this is too bad.And finally, no abuse of lightsabers. No abuse of CGI. No abuse of feminism lecturing (unlike Episode VIII). Links to the first movies are also well done.Oh and yes, Han Solo shot first! A wrong made right. Thank you again Ron Howard. This short movie scene at the end was great in many regards (see Marvel, when the villain has victory at hand but talks endlessly about how good he is, the good guy has other options than just listen).I thought that Solo was on par with Rogue One, another good Star Wars movie but for different reasons.

I really liked Rogue One, minus the unnecessary allusions to the cartoons. As such, I didn't have high expectations of this film. Yet, I found myself really liking it, all the attention to detail, even references to the obscure little-known lore of SW. While Kasdan seems to have forgotten what unnecessary exposition is and that got a bit tedious at times, I felt they were doing a great job - until the last tenish minutes of the film and then... and THEN... Uhg. There is this scene... that was absolutely the stupidest moment in any Star Wars flick. I'm including fart and burp jokes, Jar Jar Binks, and even Han shooting second. It might even be worse than Vader building C-3PO or Midichlorians. I won't spoil it, but I have to say I wish someone had warned me about that one moment in this film. When I saw it I had an internal Darth Vader ""NOOOOOOOO!"" moment. (Afterwards, even my friend's 8 year old son said ""That was pretty lame"")
So unless you enjoy unnecessarily, forcing stupid, unbelievable, references to the prequels and the silly cartoons into an otherwise great movie. do yourself this favor - when Qi'ra turns on the holoprojector on the yacht you need to quickly get up, go grab a small soda from the lobby and come back.

But hey, it's got some great action in it and it's set in the universe Lucas created. My only gripe is they seem hell bent on making these stories set on planets that look different from those of the original 3 films. They're very drab with hardly any sun. And bring back the transition swipes, it's the little things that make a Star Wars film a Star Wars film. Better than the reviews here suggest and better than TFA or TLJ.

However it was a good ""stand-alone"" film and it had its moments, honestly it had a lot more language than any other Star Wars film, but other than that, it wasn't half bad. However, I can get over these tiny mistakes:o The Falcon, in the movie, doesnt have that iconic notch between the mandibles like it has in A New Hope -> The Last Jedi, but they do this on purpose to show off that its ""brand new"" and theres no modifications. However, in Revenge of the Sith, Lucas purposefully put the Falcon in the beginning of the film as an Easter Egg. So, in a way, this movie isnt accurate, because there are Imperial Stormtroopers and Star Destroyers, indicating this is after the Jedi Purge.o A cool adventure, but its lacking some things people were hoping to see in this movie. I mean, they made up a lot of characters in this story, but no Boba Fett? (The movie everyone originally wanted?) It seems this story is restricted to only, I guess you can say ""non-canon"" characters, planets, etc. (Besides Han and Chewie but i guess thats it.)BIG SPOILER: Darth Maul makes a cameo near the end of the movie. This was supposedly the big reveal which i guess is supposed to set up the plot for the Obi-Wan movie.

There's some fun set pieces here, to be sure, especially the aforementioned card game, the train heist and the Kessel run - for those scenes, and Lando, I'm giving it as high a rating as I am.

Admittedly part of the reason for that is because my expectations were through the floor after TLJ, but at the same time, this film is not even in the same ballpark as that sad state of affairs.If anything 'Solo' is almost too respectful to the source material. The first hour is great, but then it really begins to get bogged down in self-referential fanservice. The final scene of the final act works well however, and really does set up the sequel nicely. Unfortunately we'll never get to see the sequel, as this is one of the costliest flops in box office history. That's a real shame as far as I'm concerned, as without the ridiculous droid, the incessant fanservice and the need to fill in a backstory we didn't necessarily want, or need - there's so much that can be done with this story.Ehrenreich is simply magnificent as Han Solo, only equalled by the redoubtable Harrelson as his world-weary reluctant partner, and erstwhile mentor. These two could have made a formiddable team in a sequel, Ehrenreich just oozes charm and Harrelson is the perfect counterpart; but it's all moot now as this will never happen.I won't go into the myriad elements which really suck in this movie. There are many and they are awful. But this film really does just do enough to justify another crack at it. Alas, I guess.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

778,christianrmaxwell,"A fun time, but don't expect anything too great",7,17 June 2018,"This movie, while it did look amazing, had some flaws storywise and in terms of dialogue. All in all for this movie the thing that bothered me the most was that it felt so unnecessary, that it was an obvious cash grab for the Star Wars franchise and just another chance to try and rope people into seeing the next movie to come. The ""humor"" also bothered me quite a bit, because it did not seem to land at all. The jokes and gags were unnecessary for the story and while I know that Star Wars is known for being a whacky and zany universe with otherworldly aspects associated with it, I did not see this as a viable excuse for there to be not a few, but several attempts at humor throughout this movie that just felt so forced. Donald Glover was great as Lando, and that is just about all I can say about greatness in terms of the acting department. Everyone else was merely passable and therefore not very compelling to watch. However, when this movie works, boy does it work. The action scenes (all of them) are compelling and shot beautifully. The choreography in the later fight scenes is great and all of the visual effects look so fantastic it is impossible to not give credit to the VFX department. The story was somewhat interesting as well, with some twists being added in at the end to make things more interesting. The movie did feel a tad overlong though, I do believe it could have been two hours flat or even an hour and fifty minutes and would have still been just the same quality if not better. This movie overall is definitely worth the watch if not for the visual effects alone, and is definitely a must see for diehard Star Wars fans. While this movie still seems unnecessary to me, that doesn't change the fact that I had a fun time while watching it, and it was a wild ride I do not regret taking.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

Some of the reviews by other users, seem to be harsh. The design, creativity and production values all round that has gone into the whole feel of the movie works extremely well. It has a retro feel going back to the original Star Wars, but getting the balance right with using the latest technology for today's cinematic experience. I have followed the development of Star Wars from 1977 original to the massive franchise it has become today. This movie still holds the great values movies should have, good storyline, impressive visual entertainment and good acting. Acting out a young Han Solo and Lando Calrissian is no mean feat, both actors pulled it off brilliantly. I was lucky to know Tony Dyson who developed the original R2D2, from him I understood the intense creative skill that goes into the magic that we see on the screens, I think some reviewers need to take account and consider if they could be as creative in putting a movie together before posting reviews.

About what was happening to the characters and where it was going. It turned around and became more interesting but not great.

792,jshoesmithkr,Awesome prequel but a bit confusing,8,27 May 2018,"I enjoyed this film, it's not a disaster at all. Changing director half way through making it didn't seem to ruin the story, although the ending did feel a bit plain. The battle scenes were good, the characters were used greatly, especially Chewbacca and L3 but the villain was a bit plain. For what he did was fine but there could have been more for him to do. The plot twists at the end were confusing. I didn't think it was necessary for two betrayals, Beckett seemed too loyal to lie to Han. Lando was okayish but nothing compared to Chewbacca. The new Han actor was just as good as Harrison Ford.There should definitely be a sequel to this, there are key parts of a New Hope that weren't used in this film, so maybe a sequel will link how Han met Jabba and Boba Fett and how he ended up on Tatooine, where he met Luke. The ending sure suggests that we will get a sequel, the film didn't feel complete as such. Some of the plot was hard to understand but you could pretty much understand what everyone was meant to be doing. I'd recommend that you see this film, a true Star Wars fan would want to watch it, whether they hated the Last Jedi or not. It's probably better than the Last Jedi in some areas but comparing the two is quite difficult. They both had their strong and weak points. Rogue One was better than both and probably still remains as a brilliant Star Wars film.Solo A Star Wars Story is a yes to see.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

Mixed with the stuff we're already familiar with. The special effects & action scenes were up there with Rogue One & the overall look & feel was really similar.Only grumbles I have with it is the forced humour at times, & because its a prequel there's lots of unneeded reference points.Its still miles better than the last effort - that's for sure!!",Solo - A Star Wars Story
794,fredlondi,"Fine for the first 90 minutes, but blatant padding and SJW politics ruin the experience *SPOILERS*",3,26 May 2018,"The first 90 minutes of ""Solo: A Star Wars Story"" is a perfectly adequate sci-fi heist movie. It even has likeable characters with clear motivations, a rarity in modern film. It's fast-paced - a times dizzyingly frantic - as we progress through a three-act tale. Guy loses girl, guy serves in the military, guy goes on to help in a crazy train heist, the heist fails, guy reunites with girl and has to make the Kessel Run in under 12 parsecs in a last-ditch effort to steal the maguffin.Then, in a slam cut, we're quite suddenly on a desert planet, and the film drops the anchor, deploys the parachute, and grinds on for another 45 unnecessary minutes. The film then stumbles exhausted across the finish line, leaving you with, of all things, a red-and-black faced reminder of ""The Phantom Menace.""The worst part of this fourth act was the continued infusion of gender politics. Earlier in the film, it seemed ""Solo"" was breaking away from ""The Force Awakens,"" ""The Last Jedi,"" and to a lesser extent ""Rogue One"" when it made Lando's navigator droid an obnoxious, mopey feminist type. Self-conscious and irritable, this character is presented as a comic relief as if the film's producers realized that, yes, SJW culture is a ridiculous thing. Lando himself rolls his eyes and says ""there she goes again"" every time the two butt heads. This climaxes with the film's most hilarious scene, where the droid is blasted, and Lando's efforts to rescue her accidentally tear her body in half. The ensuing death scene is comic gold.But after the Kessel Run, the film backtracks at full speed. We discover the leader of the pirates who had interfered with the group's heist is actually some freckle-faced teenage girl. She, of course, is leading The Rebellion, pointing out the injustices suffered by those around her. Suddenly, Han Solo's heart grows three times as big, and he must arrange a pair of elaborate double-crosses to help the rebellion in its efforts - even though he doesn't know this girl from anyone, or if what she's saying is true, and he's already been double-crossed by both his girlfriend and his mentor. This revelation, and how it's handled, is so facile, dull, and altogether pointless. This entire part of the movie should have been left on the cutting-room floor.But, of course, movies apparently can't just be 90 minutes anymore. They have to be 2 hour, 15 minute slogs, even if there's not that much story. The ending of ""Solo"" stands with ""Last Action Hero"" and ""Transformers: Age of Extinction's"" China scene as three of the most blatant examples of film padding I've ever seen. And, unlike the other two, it completely ruined what up until that point was a perfectly enjoyable cinematic experience.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

Once I actually sat down to watch it, I was reminded of all the interesting and revealing opportunities this setting provides. There is so much of the Han and Chewy lore that is revealed here, and it's very satisfying. Yes there is quite a bit of typical action CGI going on which can easily overwhelm me into boredom, but it is balanced here with genuinely interesting moments finding out about Lando, Chewy, and Han.

Solo, A Star Wars Story, puts the audience in the shoes of Han Solo, famous galactic smuggler, as he becomes the man he is know to be in the original trilogy. A movie of love, betrayal and overcoming obstacles, Solo delivers more than recent films, while still lacking what made a Star Wars movie good. The story did put me in a time long ago and far far away, but one that felt commercial in the end. I enjoyed seeing my favorite hero in his younger years, gaining the knowledge, meeting the friends and developing the habits that I love about him in his older years. The movie fits the genre in the sense of sci-fi and the lore of the Star Wars universe, but lacked in character originality.While I was excited to see the cast they had put together for the movie, it ended up disappointing me in the end. Donald Glover's version of Lando felt more like Glover than Lando, with the forced sarcasm and 'swagger' that he tried to emulate.

I loved this movie so much. Composer John Powell made my eyes watery whenever he made excellent use of those familiar themes at the right moments. The young actors do not resemble too much the big names of the past yet they do their very best. You will love all the colorful characters, the action, the danger, the space flights, the laser shootouts and everything else. That Han Solo is a real space cowboy. This film speaks to me. I am very much like Han Solo; always alone in my adventures. But at least he has his good buddy Chewbacca who is the best copilot in the Skyriver galaxy so far, far away. Here we see much of Han Solo's youth. His hard life on Corellia, the origin of his name, the people he cares about and loses, how he wins his prize in a game of Sabacc, how he gets his iconic Blastech DL-44 and the decisions he makes that ultimately make him a hard man.

801,southbase,A fun yet affably weird Star Wars film...by Ron Howard,6,5 June 2018,"The Star Wars Universe--by turns technologically heroic, biologically exotic, visually epic yet warmly philosophical--doesn't so much require directors as genre magicians, capable of melding nostalgia & fantasy with the type of sturdy engineering and clever eye required for theme-park rides and fighter-jet air shows (the closest approximation would be some of the genial yet narratively peppery filmmakers such as Ken Annakin and Richard Fleischer employed by Walt Disney on his 20,0000 LEAGUES UNDER THE SEA and SWISS FAMILY ROBINSON). Originated by George Lucas--who employed quite a firm producer's hand on his subsequent hires, Irvin Kershner and Richard Marquand--the central series lay dormant for 16 years before being revived again by Lucas in a thematically-muddy yet highly-successful prequel trilogy that still managed to divide fans & critics (Lucas again suspended production for several years before selling the rights to Disney). Now, after two new official entries to the central nine stories, and a somewhat-effective introductory tale called ROGUE ONE (thanks to its pleasant recycling of concepts from the original trilogy combined with a charming cast), the producers attempt a central origin story--SOLO: A STAR WARS STORY--of the franchise's most difficult human character, Han Solo. Originally played by Harrison Ford (and who returned as the character in an oddly-tragic plot development in J.J. Abrams' STAR WARS: THE FORCE AWAKENS), the whole film is in fact resolutely 'difficult' to pin down, a nominally-boisterous experience that keeps slowing down to a dark, chummy largo. Ably characterized by the slightly-curly-mopped, moon-faced Alden Ehrenreich (his subsequent adventures must have automatically straightened out Solo's hair), the film begins detailing Solo's opportunistic, ambitious drive as he transforms from a comical Empire foot-soldier in his youth to a fitfully-regretful ladies' man and plummy revolutionary. The film's action in its first half--especially a fiery anti-gravitational raid on a snowbound futuristic speeding train (but why would the villains use something as earthbound as a train??)--is well-staged and heartily assisted by a snappy support ensemble (Woody Harrelson, Thandie Newton, later Donald Glover as interplanetary gambler Lando Calrissian). But since the narrative keeps extending Solo's debtor dilemma by forcing him to offer an attempt to steal a priceless galactic fuel source for his gangster benefactors (this is really the only part of the film that bothers at all with outer space, and not even for that long), SOLO in its last hour becomes somewhat of an amiable yet didactic experience, as if the reported production trouble regarding its change in directors had crystallized into a serious budget crisis and stranding its surviving characters (including a gallant attempt at an regally icy alien-villain by Paul Bettany) onto a Brechtian desert landscape more out of a MAD MAX franchise entry rather that STAR WARS, its climax more conflicted and terrestrial than a grand space battle. Although it roughly gels together in its final 40 minutes, audiences expecting a giddy, thoroughly-warm Star Wars adventure from director Ron Howard (COCOON; WILLOW; APOLLO 13) may be somewhat taken aback at SOLO's emotional sparseness and witty yet clammy heroics. I don't believe this is unexpected; Howard started his career working for low-budget studio impresario Roger Corman, and has always understood the balance between artful reach (A BEAUTIFUL MIND; FROST/NIXON) and outright commerce (HOW THE GRINCH STOLE CHRISTMAS). Perhaps he found the story of a young, wayward rogue bluffing his way around the galaxy to his own freedom too tempting to resist even if a perceptible narrative ending was never possible or even thematically necessary (the resulting script by Star Wars veteran scribe Lawrence Kasdan with Jonathan Kasdan is being sold as an adventure when it should be more accurately pegged as a reflectively bitter yet hearty story set around some earth-type war scenes and gamblers' dens--very reminiscent of Ernest Hemingway--that just happen to be set around the universe). SOLO: A STAR WARS STORY deserves at least one good primary theatrical look from audiences and Mr. Ehrenreich--who will have a long career once he gains more varied experience as an actor but admittedly was not responsible for his change in directors--has enough chops to not get smothered by the usual CGI-created mayhem. But this is a highly-unique entry to the Star Wars Universe about a unique character, and might require a slight unique adjustment to stay with it.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
802,srdoriocourt,Solo? more like So-So,5,18 April 2019,"This movie has good things in it. (sets, music, effects, your standard Star Wars stuff) That being said, the main problem is the characters. 1. There's no point having so many new characters, as we know they gonna die because we never see them in all the other movies. We already know how the story plays out for 95% of the new characters. I would say it has stakes, but when you know all the new colorful characters will die (because like I said, we never see them at any other point). On top of that, the new characters feel bland and forgettable. i CANNOT name a single new character in this movie besides L3. Most of these problems carry on to the story, where they chose to write it in such a way that makes it again, predictable. For example, we know Lando, Han, and Chewy are going to live. The only parts I liked about the characters and story were Lando and Chewy (who even then felt a little generic). There's a twist at the end of the movie involving Darth Maul and I'm going to stop referencing it because it's so bad and will probably end up going nowhere due to the film under performing at it's opening days. In terms of comedy, nothing really got me. There was one joke with L3 and Han in the Millenium that gave me a light chuckle. On top of all this the first 30 minutes are DREADFULLY boring. I think watching a Chia Pet for a week would be less boring than the first 30 minutes of solo. After that it's not really boring even though it didn't need to be as long as it was. Most of the good things like the music,sets and effects are pretty standard for a modern Star Wars Movie. Acting is ok, the recasts are fine NEXT. In the end, Solo isn't as infamous as the prequels, isn't as good as the New trilogy, (except Last Jedi maybe), and isn't as good as the original trilogy. It's in the very middle in terms of Star Wars movies.

Nope, no go.Throw in Woody Harrelson and all I kept thinking was what is Woody the bartender doing in a space movie? Big time miscast.... the casting directors were obviously not followers of Star Wars...Since I'd read stories about the s*&$ show involving the directors and having to call in Ron Howard to save the picture, I wasn't sure what to expect. But what I saw here reflects a hodgepodge of unrelated stories, stitched together to try and make some semblance of a movie... and it fails, miserably...Other than Chewbacca, which was the only character I ""bought into""... the rest of the cast were just a bunch of actors in some sort of space chase drama, which kind of looked like it might be related to Star Wars... but misses by a long shot. Donald Glover as a young Lando was a decent attempt, but missed the swagger mark in the end....For those reviewers who gave this train wreck anything above a 5, I suspect they're new to the Star Wars franchise and don't have a close connection to the first three movies.... else how could they believe that this was Han Solo?I'm glad I didn't waste my time and money in a theatre with this train wreck of a movie.... catching it on cable was bad enough...... how George Lucas let this be made is beyond me...",Solo - A Star Wars Story

It simply wasn't very compelling, most (but not all) of the attempts at humor fell flat, and social messages were laid on a bit thick and awkwardly. Also, this movie's obligatory new droid fell flat as well.On the positive side, Ehrenreich and Glover were well-cast and did an excellent job of portraying the younger versions of their characters.

810,daveinpublic-279-224878,"Not bad, but follows the same formula as other new Star Wars movies",7,8 June 2018,"The past 3 Star Wars movies have been disappointing. I know that the reviews were pretty good, and they made billions, but those reviews come from the 'professional' critics. If you look at IMDB and see the actual movie goers reviews, especially the die hards, it wasn't what they wanted. Disney got away with it 3 times, but people are learning. It's just more of the same formula.The formula is... some character in a movie goes through a challenge, and at the end, the character's story arc connects with a previous episode or they have a happy ending or a PC message is related. Either way, they basically have the beginning and the end, now they can lazily connect the dots through some random stuff that happens in space and doesn't follow laws, previous info, or make sense. They do this over and over. ** SPOILERS ** Han Solo has to get back to the bad guy. How do we make it interesting? Put a maelstrom in his way. Why does he have to get back fast? Well, of course the unrefined energy will blow up in 17 parsecs. Then put a giant star fighter in the way. He gets around it by going into the maelstrom. What now? Put a giant octopus in their way. How can we get rid of this giant octopus? Put a giant black hole next to it that the octopus can be sucked into. This continues for a while.The movies feel hollow because of this. In Rogue One, there was some giant satellite that needed to be pointed one direction. It wasn't even in the story up until then, it wasn't explained, it was just space jargon that you're not supposed to get and then they'll explain that friendship is important and that will make sure the movie has a message and is worth watching. If you criticize the movie, you don't like friendship.That being said, I think this movie was a little better than the other 3, but will still leave you with some of that hollow feeling. Like it wasn't a story, just a product.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
811,danamadeus,No good,5,29 August 2018,"Watching this movie is kind of a similar experience to watching Justice League. At that makes sense because both films had similar production drama. Both had a replacement director come on board at the 11th hour to reshoot about 70% of the movie in order to release something that halfway resembled an actual film. And in that regard Disney was successful. Solo halfway resembles an actual film.Just like Justice League, this movie feels so thrown together, lazy, uninspired dull and lifeless. But at least it almost looks like a complete, finished film...which is more than can be said for Justice League. While The Last Jedi was a bad film, dull and directionless, it at least tried new things and had some interesting ideas. Solo is worse because it brings absolutely nothing new or interesting to the table. The movie's ""plot"" is just an excuse to string together everything Han Solo is said to have done in the original trilogy (winning the millennium falcon in a game of cards, the Kessel run) into one movie that takes place over the course of like two days. A good rule for making a prequel *should* be does this movie's plot work as a coherrent story without watching the films that take place after. Or if the movie wasn't a prequel, and this one was actually made first, would it make any sense. Its okay for a prequel to make little subtle nods to things that will happen in the future, but the entire plot of a movie can't be that!!This movie just feels like half-assed fan-fiction. Neither the guy who plays Han solo not Donald Glover ever feel like they're actually Han Solo and Lando Calrissian. They just seem like completely different people that we are being told are those characters. It really makes you wonder why Disney removed all the old novels from canon and why they didn't just adapt those instead of making this nothing of a movie.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
812,bsilbor,"A rather simple plot that was weirdly executed, but didn't detract from an otherwise fun and entertaining movie.",9,27 May 2018,"I really enjoyed this movie. The production design was very reminiscent of the original movie back in 1977 where everything is dirty, grimey, and very used. Even though the Falcon was shinier than we remember it, it still felt used. The acting was great, especially from Alden Ehrenreich and Donald Glover, who nailed their performances as both Han Solo and Lando Calrissian. Chewbacca was great as usual, and the new actor they have for him has done a phenomenal job filling the very big shoes (literally) of Peter Mathew. Another fun character was L3-37. Say what you will about SJWs or whatever nonsense people complain about, but her character was funny, almost as charismatic as Lando himself, and beautifully sarcastic. Another rather minor character I found myself fond of, and a bit disappointed to see discarded halfway through he movie, was Rio, voiced by Jon Favreau. The other characters were fine, but the aforementioned ones really stood out to me. There were a few plot twists, none as extravagant as Darth Vader's classic, ""No...I am your father,"" line, but still relavent to the story and the character of Han Solo as a whole. The best surprise came very near to the end of the movie when it was revealed that the main villain of the movie was actually serving Darth Maul the whole time. The general plot wasn't awful, but I think that a change in directors halfway through the production chopped it up a bit. This didn't ruin the movie for me, however, as it's filled with funny humor, exciting scenes, and an Old-Western-feel.What I think may be the film's strongest asset was the dynamic between characters. Han and Chewie's first encounter with each other was executed in a surprising and inventive way, and it worked to perfection. Their on-screen chemistry was as strong as it was in A New Hope, despite it being two completely different actors. The banter and love-hate relationship between Han and Lando was also a lot of fun. Qui'ra and Han's relationship, though left open-ended, was realistic and maybe even a bit tragic. Make no mistake, there is a lot of fan service in this film. A lot of callbacks and explanations for things we've seen and/or heard before. The Kessel Run, check. Han's blaster origins, check. Winning the Falcon, check. Han shooting first, check. ""I have a bad/good feeling about this"", check. A lot of Star Wars constants we're, again, present in this film, though with a rather unnoticeable absence of a certain droid duo, but some of these callbacks felt more subtle and maybe even missable to the casual Star Wars fan.All in all, a 9/10 for a movie that I wasn't really all that interested in after the first trailer. As the premier date approached, however, I began getting more excited and I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed the film. I understand that many didn't, and that's okay, but for me Star Wars is still alive and well, and I look forward to more in the future.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
813,erollence,Silhouettes,6,28 May 2018,"If you like your movie experience to feel like you're wearing dark sunglasses in a fog filled theater-this is the movie for you. Unnecessarily dark. Every scene is back lit. The actors are rarely seen as anything but silhouettes. And I watched the 2D version. I can only imagine how dark the 3D version was. The cinematographer tried to give the movie gravitas by under lighting it. One might have thought the movie starred horrible looking actors, and they back lit every scene so we could never see their faces. Maybe they thought dubbing the movie for different languages would be easier if we couldn't see facial features. There is a very brief scene where we can actually see direct light on Emilia Clarke's face. It was startling! Oh, that's what she looks like! Even daytime scenes outside on a beach, or on a snow covered planet, were dark and sunless. I've never seen snow that looked so bleak. Star Wars has become Noir Wars.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
814,hbcwanders,Got me by surprise,9,26 May 2018,"I had little to no expectations for this movie, after the deception of TLJ but gave Star Wars a chance with this one.For starters, there's only 1 Han Solo and that is Harrison Ford. I missed the subtle touches Ford gave to Han Solo but this actor does a good job.The forced romance was something they could have skipped and the droids freedom riot was a bit too much.That said, the rest was simply a very good movie, the timeframe was set before TPM (part 1) and the overall image of the movie felt Star Wars.Chewbacca really saves this movie as well imho, he shone throughout the whole movie. I loved Chewie!
Lando was okay in the movie, I expected more of him really.
Woody Harrison was solid as ever, what a good actor and he fit his role perfectly.
Paul Bettany was also good in this movie, but the role was not a true villain-type.
The CGI was very good and never bothered me once.Overall this movie is a nice addition to the story of Han Solo. 
I loved every Millenium Falcon scene and we finally got the see Kessel-Kun being done in 12 parsecs.The story of Qi'Ra was something to think about as I don't know where to put her in this movie, she seemed a nice lovely person but she turned bad during the movie.The Darth Maul Cameo leaves this movie wide open for a sequel, which is needed to see where the story of Han and Qi'Ra will lead to.I left the cinema feeling good about this movie.

I only watched it now because i had nothing else to see at home and it was free.I wonder how was it possible to have so much content and make it so boring? I mean, it is a masterpiece of boring. Close up shots of almost everything. Epic music with no pause button ( movie starts - epic music starts - movies ends - epic music stops ). Constant freaking action. Like, give me a break, let me rest my eyes from all the close-ups.The kindergarten quality scripting of the Han Solo connections with the Star Wars saga ( His name, his weapon, him speaking Chewies language, the MF etc.. ) is just cringe worthy.The actor who played Han Solo (don't even care who he was), is either an amateur or a very bad fit for this character. I have seen better impressions from random youtubers.It felt like a mess of everything they could think o with little to nothing to say.Speaking of saying something, they thought it would be a good idea to sprinkle some social justice b.s. into scenes. I have no problem with politics, but the scenes were anyways a mess and now you throw some random ""holier than thou"" sound bites in there and make it look even messier.I don't know man.... what happened to making good movies? Why does everything have to be fast food McDonalds crap nowadays. This movie was so bad that I think somebody should have gotten fired here.

I really wish they would have found a Solo and Lando that looked a little more like the real guys, but hey, what can you expect, they weren't really trying with this movie.These movies (Solo, Rogue One) are the movies that they SHOULD have been making right after Return of the Jedi. Get the original cast back to reprise their roles and have some fun. These movies would have been INFINITELY better with better actors, original cast, and better directors. I think Ron Howard did the best he could pulling this out of the fire...but Im sure he had very little say in the over all production. This franchise is tightly controlled buy a very few people (Kathleen Kennedy, Im looking at you), that need to pass it along to a new generation. The Indiana Jones Franchise, and the Star Wars franchise have both taken big hits with these rushed movies, poor plots, and little imagination.If Solo could have been given to Ron Howard immediately, and he was given some input, I think it would have been amazing.

824,Akaanksh,UNIQUE BUT RUSHED,7,25 May 2018,"SOLO: A STAR WARS STORY MOVIE REVIEW
SCORE - 7/10
Unlike the previous ten STAR WARS films, 'SOLO' is set in a lawless world, a world where the crime syndicates rule and not in a world where there is a constant war between the light and the dark side of the force. The film has a good start with this concept and it maintains this for the most part of the runtime.
The third act of the film makes the audience anticipate something great and then is ruined with too many attempts at surprises and plot twists. The film's ending is then dragged only for the ORIGINAL TRILOGY(EPISODE IV-VI) Easter Eggs.
Even though Paul Bettany's character Dryden Vos lacked a proper screen time and was poorly written, he manages it by delivering a good acting performance. Even his fellow co-stars never compromised in doing their best.
Ron Howard should be credited for changing a-doomed-to-be-failed kind of film into an entertaining and a worthy inclusion into the STAR WARS franchise. 
STAR WARS films are known for having an unnecessary sub-plot(s) and in this one it is about escaping a place called 'The Maw', with no consequences at all and was also the most boring part.
The core of the film revolves around a hyperfuel called 'Coaxiom' which is shown both as a boon and a threat if not handled properly as it is powerful enough to take down an entire mountain and can make a Kessel Run in twelve parsecs.
Overall, SOLO: A STAR WARS STORY manages to be a good film that the divided STAR WARS fan base needs at the moment until Episode XI drops next year. It could be said that the production was rushed but it was still good unlike how it was predicted to be.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
825,CadBane73,Solo: This is not my story (a.k.a. Not a Star Wars Story),5,26 May 2018,"If you come to the theater expecting a Star Wars movie or a movie about Han Solo, turn around. Han Solo is a completely irrelevant character for the plot save 4 scenes that explain a couple references to other movies. And it does it quick and bad.It also rippes off some aspects of the Star Wars universe so bad you will facepalm and curse at Ron Howard all along to the point Han doesn't even quote some of his most famous quotes correctly. I am a huge Star Wars fan, but the point where the last movies are taking it with not following canons is outrageous and unnecessary.Having said that, if you take the ""Solo"" and the ""Star Wars"" words out of the title, it is a palatable story about opposing crime syndicates, albeit not fully leveraged. There is only one ""Omfg"" moment in the movie next to the end that I expect at least a novel to deepen into.I am okay with making the new movies new and fresh, but put a director with a slight knowledge about the Star Wars universe in front of the next projects so as to make the new compatible with the old, at least. Sadly, I believe my last words will be: ""I got a bad feeling about this...""",Solo - A Star Wars Story

827,Jorge_Mota,Finally. A movie to match the original!,9,28 May 2018,"Many people are disgusted with the path taken in the most recent trilogy. SW: TLJ is not a good movie. I grant that. But, should S:aSWS suffer because of it. No. It would be unjust.
This is the second spin-off, or ""A Star Wars Story"" to be made into movie (there are also the TV animated shows). If ""Rogue One"" was the story of a misfit with a troubled past lost inside the Rebellion, S:aSWS is the mirror image of that. It is the story of a misfit with a troubled past lost inside the world of organized crime and political power that supports the Empire. And what a story that makes!
For videogame buffs (and 'Borderlands' fans), many scene ideas were recognisable from some of the most fantastic videogames.
And I watched it on IMAX 3D. Nuff said.
This movie treats its viewers as adults. It weaves its story artfully with some of the most iconic facts of the Star Wars Universe: meeting Chewbacca, getting the Millenium Falcon, making the Kessel Run in less than twelve parsecs (if you round it down...). These do not seem imposed on the movie, as eyeblinks to the fan, but come naturally and allow for character and story development. Whoever wrote and directed this movie knew what they were doing.
The scenes change from dirty cities to muddy battlefields, icy planets, dark mines, paradisiac beaches, and the actors never lose the grip on their characters.
In the end, you end up realising this is the same Han Solo portrayed by Harrison Ford, only younger - and this one does shoot first!

Since then the dream has been tarnished a bit by kiddie matinee tie ins, insufferable 'auteur' directors obsessed with 'art' rather than entertainment, and the increased obsession with The Force. Get a clue fans! The Force is just a literary gimmick like Spock's mind meld, and Doc Smith's Lens. It's not supposed have serious philosophical or religious meaning. With Solo we finally have a return to the fun of the original, of blazing ray gun battles, alien bars filled with the scum of a thousand worlds, and spaceships blasting off into a wild and exciting universe.

833,osborneshawn,A Decent Effort But Far From Exceptional,7,27 December 2019,"After indulging in the Star Wars movies yet again over the Christmas break and sifting through a few reviews, I found myself needing to make a couple of comments on this film.
First off, a very good effort put in by all involved here. Good direction and a pretty interesting story overall. Very good acting, especially by Woody Harrelson.
But there is one feature of this movie that really bothers me and I am sure that I am not alone in this regard, and that is the pitiful attempt to portray the forging of the relationship between Han and Chewbacca.
The bond between these two is one of the most well known and fabled in all of science fiction/fantasy cinema. When I heard about the production of this movie I was so excited to finally get to see an on screen telling of the first meeting between these two. How did the Wookie come to love this human so much that he basically swore a lifetime oath of loyalty to him ? Those familiar with some of the literature regarding this backstory had an idea of what to expect. And although we dont always get exactly what we desire when it comes to this sort of thing. We usually expect something that is close to the mark or at least worthy of the characters involved.
I dont want to go into detail about what the canon storyline says about Han and Chewie's first encounter and ensuing relationship dynamics. But let's just say that this movie fails miserably in this regard. Lifelong path of loyalty because someone helps you out of a pit after being held prisoner together for a mere two days ?? There was no effort whatsoever on behalf of the studio or scriptwriters to do this aspect of the story justice. I was incredibly disappointed with this aspect of the movie.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

And unlike other origin films, it doesn't feel the need to have Han become the man we all love in the first movie! This is easily Ron Howard's best film in a long time and hopefully Disney will wise up and stop trying to get hipster doofus directors to handle their biggest franchise. Give Star Wars to the vets who know how to shoot and know what audiences want!!! Good cast, good direction, good effects and action, consistently entertaining.

But at the end of it I had fun there is not really anything to dislike here but there isn't anything to be blown away by either. I liked Ron Howard's directing although for the most part it did seem like it was for a pay check. The color was bit dull but the soundtrack was actually great. In the beginning it was a bit too campy at times but In the end it fit the characters pretty well.

There wasn't a lot of jump between different scenes, it was pretty much straight forward and followed a direction. It wasn't totally illogical, humour wasn't forced on us too much. There was a couple of twists that would be more fitting in a Marvel movie, but it didn't made me want to rip my eyes off. Other than that I was quite confused by the apparition of a popular star wars character in it, I feel like not much was done to justify or explain it's presence. All the majors characters were pretty good in their roles, especially Alden Ehrenreich he had huge shoes to fill and he did quite good, sure he's not Harrison Ford, but he played a less mature, less experienced version of the character Ford played and in that sense he nailed it. For me this movie is the movie that has the most OG Star Wars trilogy feel to it, Ron Howard did a pretty good job.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
843,mynban,Something missing,6,31 May 2018,"""Something missing"" is the best way to describe what is wrong with Solo: A Star Wars Story. The visuals were nice in overall, the rugged nature of smuggler part of Star Wars universe was well delivered, but not in an original way. It was more of a Firefly with Star Wars theme (not that it was a bad thing, I love Firefly).Story had high enough odds that should have kept me hooked up during action, but failed to have that immersive feeling where it makes you hold your breath, or even care at all.Biggest problem was that, when something happened it happened without story building towards it so that we may have cared. There were so many events that followed the introduction into directly conclusion without the build-up in between. And the little build-up that actually happens almost never reflects on the next part of the story. It almost felt like those scenes were shot without an order and without actually deciding what happens beforehand in story, and this is likely to be the case since it changed directors mid-production.One more thing that bothered me is that Emilia Clarke's acting felt like she was only handed a script without knowing what kind of character/personality she needs portray and just reading her lines in a generic way. We know her to be a good actress so only explanation I can have is that director did not know what kind of person Kira (Qi'ra?)character was neither.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

845,shayol-48294,A fun to watch heist adventure set in the Star Wars universe,8,26 May 2018,"I thought Force Awakens was well made, but the story was basically copied from a new hope so it left me kind of disappointed.
I liked Roque One very much as it contained a lot of the old Star Wars vibes.I however think Episode 8 the Last Jedi is not only a terrible Star Wars movie, but also a terrible movie in general. The story, script, connection to the existing universe is perforated by so many plot holes and inconsistencies. Of course it looks good, but it has no heart, no soul and all the characters act illogical and ultimately stupid.Because of that I was afraid to watch Solo as I am really confused and angry of what a mess they produced with the Last Jedi.But I can give an all-clear here. This movie has a different tone, it fits the existing Star Wars universe, yet adding enough new stuff, like characters, locations, costumes, ships, droids, and weapons.The sound design is very good, the music is really good as well. The CGI and overall look is very well done. I was afraid to not like Alden Ehrenreich as Han Solo, because he does look different. But he is doing his job quite well. I didn't have a problem thinking of him as the young Solo after some time into the movie.Following parts contain very minor and vague spoilers (really very vague!):This is of course not a trilogy film and focusing more on the smuggling area of the Star Wars universe, so one shouldn't expect major epic space battles or light saber / force duels here, but a fun to watch heist adventure with some plot twists throughout the finale.There is however again some political SJW agenda disguised in a female droid fighting for droid rights... I mean seriously, this throws everyone out of the story, why does this have to be in fantasy movies?? It's cringe-worthy that Lando is so emotional about that droid. I don't get the message here, are you actually making fun of women fighting for their rights? Or is this a disguised political message? Or is this a parody of our society? I really have no clue, instructions unclear, what exactly SHOULD I feel about this, other than that it's the worst part about this movie, doesn't fit and is cringe-worthy at max-level...Oh and that cameo in the end will be hard to swallow for basically anyone who isn't into animated series, comics, books, etc. So this cameo kinda felt out of place to me, but I get what you are trying to do here...Still albeit those 2 things a very well made and enjoyable movie. I definitely will watch it again!",Solo - A Star Wars Story
846,MovieMattic,Welcome Back Han Solo,9,29 May 2018,"SPOILER: Han Solo is one of the best characters in the Star Wars Universe. So my opinion on a stand-alone movie might be a bit biased but I have more than loving Han Solo on my side. Solo: A Star Wars Story was filled with laughs, surprises and twists all with fantastic direction from Ron Howard.The Plot
We're introduced to a young Solo (Alden Ehrenreich) which btw nailed the role that made Harrison Ford famous, along with his lovely girlfriend Qi'ra (Emilia Clarke) on the ship building world of Corellia. Both of them want to escape their life of servitude, buy their own ship and fly around the galaxy together.With a tube full of the hyperfuel coaxium both Solo and Qi'ra head to a security gate to escape from the planet. Solo makes it but unfortunately Qi'ra gets caught during the deed therefore stuck on the planet.Solo swears he'll find a way to buy a ship and come back to rescue her.Three Years Later
Solo ends up joining the Empire with the goal of being a pilot but gets expelled from the Imperial Flight Academy for insubordination. He's stuck as an infantryman on the planet Mimban where he meets Tobias Beckett (Woody Harrelson) and his team posing as Imperial soldiers.Solo tries blackmailing them into letting him in on their plan to steal Imperial equipment so he can get off the planet and rescue his love. The posers draw this to the attention of an officer near by and end up throwing Solo into a pit where he was meant to be eaten by the vicious Chewbacca. Their meeting was quite engaging and hilarious.Solo is able to speak a bit of Chewie's language and convinces him to team up and jump on the posers ship where they all go off together on a mission to steal huge crates of the hyperfuel coaxium for the dangerous high-ranking boss of Crimson Dawn.My Thoughts
At first I was confused about where this film fits into the Star Wars timeline especially after seeing a special cameo you'll be completely surprised about. The timeline is explained well in this article. I recommend reading that article if you're confused on where this movie fits in.I felt like having a Solo movie was actually a great move for the franchise since in Episode VII Solo was tragically killed by Kylo Ren which I personally think was one of the stupidest moves ever made.So it was wonderful having Solo back in his own film especially after having no Solo whatsoever in Episode VIII which in my opinion was the worst Star Wars ever. There were too many things wrong with that film and one of them was the void left by Solo's absence.In Conclusion
It was great seeing a young Solo on screen along with Chewie and Lando Clarissian (Donald Glover). I loved Woody Harrelson and Emilia Clarke. Best of all Alden Ehrenreich really played his part well. He is Han Solo.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
847,capaldimark,A mostly enjoyable Star Wars adventure,7,27 May 2018,"Five months after the release of the polarizing ""Star Wars: The Last Jedi"", we have a new Star Wars adventure in the form of a spin-off movie based on the popular character ""Han Solo"", titled ""Solo: A Star Wars Story"", directed by Ron Howard. While it may not add anything important to the Star Wars universe, ""Solo"" ends up being a mostly enjoyable adventure that will surely please Star Wars fans.Solo takes place between the events of episodes 3 and 4, where the Empire controls most of the galaxy. Resources are scarce, and many crime bosses are fighting over valuable resources such as hyper fuel, known as Coaxium. In this, we follow a young Han (Alden Ehrenreich), who longs to get away from the planet of Corellia with his girlfriend Qi'ra (Emilia Clarke) so that he can become a pilot and live a free life. It provides what we call an ""origin story"" for Han, but the main issue here is that it doesn't really add anything important to the Star Wars universe. Sure, it gives Han a backstory, but it doesn't really add anything fresh or new to the Star Wars lore. The story just doesn't have that much substance to it, and ultimately it feels like a movie that probably didn't have to be made. That's not to say that it's a bad story, however, because it does give a lot of insight into Han's backstory and history, and fans of the character will certainly love and appreciate it. An issue with origin stories is that they can sometimes drag, and Solo is no exception. At 2 hours and 15 minutes, the story does drag sometimes, especially during towards the end where it goes on far too long. Ultimately, the movie succeeds because of its likeable characters, and it's helped by a great cast that truly embodies their characters. Ehrenreich's performance as a young Han is very convincing and spot on, from the way he delivers his lines to his different facial expressions. He really reminded me of what a young Han Solo would actually be like. Ever wondered what a young Lando Calrissian would be like? Well look no further than Donald Glover's performance here. He has the charm and wit that you would expect a young Lando to have, and he and Ehrenreich have good chemistry together in their scenes. Some other characters include Emilia Clarke's Qi'ra, who is Han's love interest, Paul Bettany as crime lord Dryden Vos, and Woody Harrelson as the criminal Tobias Beckett, who sort of serves as a mentor to Han. Chewbacca also appears in the film, and he plays a big part in it, as this is technically his origin story as well. The film has plenty of action scenes, many of which are exhilarating, but its emphasis on its characters and the interaction between them is what makes this one enjoyable. It will be interesting to see how Solo does at the box office. It certainly won't make as much as a main installment in the Star Wars saga, but will it underachieve? If it does, could it be because of the holiday weekend or the possibility of franchise fatigue? It's likely to be a combination of both, but franchise fatigue should not be ignored. Only five months ago we had The Last Jedi, so Disney better be careful with how they plan to release Star Wars movies so that they don't tire the fans out.Despite a few flaws, Solo: A Star Wars Story is a solid effort from the folks over at Lucasfilm. It's mostly disposable and not a completely necessary movie, but its creators do the best job they could have possibly done to make this Star Wars adventure fly higher than the past couple installments in the series.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
848,forster-80382,Not the best film ever But:,8,7 November 2021,"I do continually observe comments about being a money grab.

849,thanhart,Low expectations - Pleasant surprise,8,24 May 2018,"I had low expectations due to the trailers and the latest critics. Since I'm an absolute fanboy since 1978, every new Star Wars movie had and has a hard time to reach my fan heart.The 'Episodes I-III' were more or less a disappointment for me at the time of its release. Thanks to Clone Wars, books, and comics that has changed now. And they have the signature of the master, the spirit which completely lacking in the new episode films.Then 'Rogue One', a first ray of a new hope. An exciting new look on the times of the first Death Star with sympathetic characters, atmospheric staging, but unfortunately a bit too sad undertone, especially compared to the exalted, euphoric original trilogy.Now 'Solo'. Lot's of rumors in advance, trailers that did not really electrifying, press critiques that ranged from dull to ok. So I went to the IMAX permiere as part of a 501st Garrison Troop, turned my rounds as Episode V Vader in front of a handful of audience... and then sat in the chair sweaty and just thought nothing.All I can say now is, that 'Solo' already has its place in my Star Wars heart. It's again a new perspective on this time, imaginatively and lovingly designed. My biggest concerns regarding the main actor have also not been confirmed at all. He does a great job by playing Han as he should be, not a superficial hero.
Maybe it's because I always loved Western movies, especially Leone and Eastwood, and this is indeed kind of a Western movie.And ir really works. I was not really bored for a minute. No, that was a pleasant surprise this evening and I would regret not having seen this movie on the big screen. It's not Star Wars but really a nice Star Wars Story.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

851,kubapawlowski,Mixed Bag,5,26 May 2018,"No one really asked for this but we still got it so lets review it. First of Han Solo, the actor looks alright but he doesn't really capture the character or even act well overall. Lando was alright believable for me at least.
The real problem I have with this film is the story it is so generic and forgettable that you don't really care, and also applies tor the new characters as you know where the story goes after the film. But thankfully the film it doesn't do anything to ruin or change the original trilogy.On the other hand there are some good moments which made the film alright, like the action scenes and the whole meeting of two characters you know very well. If you don't see this film though, you really wont be missing out.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
852,Return_of_the_Porg,A Welcome Surprise,7,25 May 2018,"The first time I heard that Disney was flirting with the possibility of making a Han Solo prequel I was out. In fact I felt the same way when it was announced that Lucasfilm would be producing spin-off films. I've always been a Saga film geek and although I would welcome other Star Wars anthology films I would always warn against the threat of franchise fatigue. Star Wars is the biggest movie franchise of all time and it got there by producing six films over 28 years and at no point felt the necessity to have yearly releases. And while Star Wars fatigue might be reeling in is Solo able to surpass expectations?
To be fair I had really low expectations regarding this film, my excitement was't very high either. But as I sat down last night and watched it I am pleased to say that I had a great time. Solo is by the numbers when it comes to the plot and even more so if you know Han's Legends backstory. The plot is straight forward and very small in scope which is refreshing in a franchise where planets blow up left and right. However as a result of this streamlined plot and the fact that this movie is a prequel the steaks are not very high since we know that some events must occur. Having said that it's still very fun seeing how these events actually took place even though we know the outcome. 
One aspect of the film that worried me a lot was how would they characterize Han. They did a great job of showing us how Han was like before ANH(A New Hope) but the film doesn't really take Han to where he is character-wise in the original Star Wars. So in this respect the movie feels incomplete as It's obvious that Lucasfilm plans to explore this transformation into the hardened rogue in future installments. 
Thankfully the film does stay away from some prequel clichés and is not stuffed to the brim with in your face callbacks to other Star Wars material. However if you are a Star Wars geek like myself you will find a lot of hidden value in the form of verbal nods, artifacts and general Easter-eggs sprinkled throughout the run-time. 
Finally the cast was great and my fears that Alden Ehrenreich would never be able to be a convincing Han were thrown out the wayside as he is charismatic and fun as Han with out having to do an exact impersonation. He gives Han his own spin but it still feels just like Han Solo should as he very well emulates some of the classic Han mannerisms and speech patterns. Donald Glover is okay as Lando but I enjoyed Alden Ehrenreich's performance way more and to be fair I think Glover's performance is being overrated by the critics. Woody Harrelson was great as Beckett, a gun slinging space bad ass who becomes a father figure for Han, heck even Emilia Clarke was good as Qi'ra. Paul Bettany was also great as the films antagonist but his short screen-time was a bit of a bummer. 
Now that I've discussed the cast I need to talk about my absolute favorite aspect of this film and that is the relationship between Han and Chewbacca. It feels very genuine and sweet, it'a funny and solid and it is the foundation of this film. Chewie steals the show to be quite frank and it's so worth it, I might have to say that this is the most fun I've ever had while watching Chewie it is truly that good. He not only has some great moments in the action set-pieces but he also has some really hysterical moments as well. Which is a great segue into the comedy and how organic it feels. In contrast to episode 7 or 8 the comedy in the film happens organically and it's not over the head humor like the Marvel films. It actually hearkens back to the humor in the original trilogy which was subtle not glaringly obvious. 
On the negative side of the spectrum it would be hard to delve in deeply because some of my gripes with the film are bathed in the spoiler territory. However I wasn't a fan of certain decisions made by the writers of the film, without any spoilers I wasn't at all a fan of the new droid character since it was a walking talking embodiment of a Star Wars SJW, I wasn't a fan of the character at all. It is also worth mentioning that the movie has some really great characters but unfortunately some of my favorites aren't in the movie for a whole long which is a major bummer. 
Overall ""Solo: A Star Wars Story"" turned out much better than what I hoped, It's not a masterpiece but it's a very fun summer blockbuster with a solid story and characters, some awesome action and magnificent special effects. The humor is great and the fun factor is real here so I would recommend a watch if you're on the fence as I was. I'm actually surprised to say that I would like to see where they take this story from here and would actually be interested in giving a sequel a shot. But as a Star Wars film it's not top tier but it sure is really fun and worth a shot. Who knows, maybe you'll like it more than I did since this film caters a bit more to the casual audience. As of one viewing my score is a solid 7.5/10.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

What a mistake. Solo is the second best movie in the entire series, just behind the original. And actually, along with it, the only one I really like. Empire strikes back, except for a compelling start has actually nothing worth mentioning, with construction of the movie that resambles a long transitional TV episode. Return of the Jedi is a typical kitsch of the 80's with cute teddy bears and thousands of saturated colors all over ... ugh. Rebooting the series, judging by all new entries, it better not have happened. ""Solo"", on the other hand, is unpretentious, lightharted, entertaining, suspenseful and most importantly, designed exactly like a Star Wars movie should look like. From costumes and locations to creatures and characters. Flawless. There is also a great cast and a lot of unobtrusive and functional humor.

859,EnemyPavement,Solo lives up to it's potential,8,17 June 2018,"We've all read the articles about how Solo was a disaster during production and even heard some rumors about how this film was strategically made poorly in order to make the next installment of the prequel trilogy look good. I had my doubts too. It's unfortunate that such a delightful film could be bullied before it's theatrical release. Fortunately the project was rescued by the film's true hero: Ron Howard, who re-shot nearly 70% of the film in the last five weeks of production. This is an impressive accomplishment seeing as how you cannot tell one bit that more than half the footage was rushed during the last few weeks. It is clear that Ron Howard is a master filmmaker, otherwise this film would be the disaster everyone claims it is.The film does not start off strong. It leaves a few things unexplained and there are a few disposable characters that are a little uninspiring.However, the film does pick up about 20 minutes in. This is right around when Chewbacca shows up.Though the minor characters are a little uninteresting, the leads really give a great performance. Donald Glover did a great job portraying the role of a younger Lando. He understood the character and was really able to separate his performance from Billy Dee Williams' without losing the important aspects of what makes Lando so entertaining on screen.Alden Ehrenreich (who I had little faith in before seeing the film) did the same. He took the time to study the character Han Solo and not Harrison Fords performance of Han. I think Ehrenreich's negative reception comes from Star Wars fans who have a biased for the original trilogy. These people need to let go and just enjoy the story.The film's main accomplishments were giving Han Solo a strong backstory, further developing the characters personality, as well as futher expanding the Star Wars universe.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

As a die-hard SW fan, I decided to table my review until a second viewing. Saw it again yesterday and I can now honestly say that I enjoyed this film. After my overwhelming disappointment with TLJ and hearing all of the production problems with Solo, I was fearful that Solo would be a repeat of TLJ and all of its mistakes...
1) I felt Rian Johnson was flippant towards the story and especially the fans regarding all of the questions established in TFA. 
2) Way too much forced humor; it just didn't work. 
3) Way too much CGI - of all the new films, Rogue One seemed to capture the practical effects feel the best, returning in style to the originals. 
4) The Canto Bight sequence - need I say more? Those things being said, I feel Solo was more in line with Rogue One, which I truly enjoyed, when compared to TLJ. Solo has brought me back, at least in part, to believing some who are involved still have respect for the story and fans. I felt Solo had an interesting plot, lots of action, and the humor was balanced well. And yes, after a short while I was sold on Alden's Han Solo. I know plenty of people will hate the movie and boycott, I get that. I boycotted Indiana Jones and The Crystal Skull because I thought their intentions were disingenuous and it was just a money grab. Had Solo been on par with TLJ then I might be at the boycott point with SW movies. But Solo upped the bar a little bit and it excites me about the next SW universe movie. I know some felt we didn't need a Solo movie, but I'm not regretting spending good money to see more bro-mance between Han & Chewy.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
864,azmark1887,More Fun Than Most of the Star Wars Films,9,3 June 2018,"If you are going to make a prequel Star Wars film introducing Han Solo, it had better be fun. This is a fun action adventure film that moves at a mostly fast pace. We learn a lot about Han's backstory, and there are several twists to what seems like a straight-forward heist film. The cast has plenty of charisma, including Alden Ehrenreich, as a reckless and naive orphan evidently sold into slavery. He has a good dose of youthful arrogance, though, as we would expect.The action sequences are excellent, the music includes much of the familiar Williams' score, and there are plenty of otherworldly characters and environments to keep things interesting.

865,jnaps098,SoLo-wer your expectations,4,1 June 2018,"The problem is the entire movie desperately tries to tap in to your nostalgia about the titular character and that's it. There's not much of anything else apart from it.They shoehorned in every piece of trivia so a large part of the plot is completely predictable, especially after they introduce Lando Calrissian. You know Han Solo is going join the game, which will lead to the Millenium Falcon, then Lando losing it to Han Solo and then Han Solo eventually having to do his Kessel run. So we're just going through the motions. I wish they had shown Han Solo as someone who gambles (before meeting Lando), a more shoot-fron-hip kind of guy.None of the events have an emotional resonance outside of nostalgia. I wasn't really convinced why Han Solo and Chewbacca would become such good friends based on this story. Why would Chewbacca not choose to stay with the few remaining Wookies instead? Also, I felt Qi'ra's character was a bit more interesting than the titular hero. I wasn't really rooting for him any time.Technically, did they even show the Kessel run? They kind of showed the start of it. But way Han Solo pulls it off, it did not seem like a once-off, astonishing feat. It looked easily repeatable which takes away the awe.While this is a misfire, at leaset the movie not a slap across the face like the previous one was. And Han shots first!",Solo - A Star Wars Story

I also think Alden Ehrenreich was good in this one, he reminds you of Harrison Ford's performance, but also manages to do his own thing. Not bad at all. The only critique I have is the grading and lighting in this movie. It looks too muted, moody, desaturated and ""dark"" for the story.

When it's questioned, he still believes.3) The story of 'relationships' is built here and it's comically and cutely done - with the furry friend... This is a neat look into what is not or has not been discussed. At the same time, Chewbacca gets more screen time in communication than ever before. Win.4) We learn about how the ideology of 'Star Wars' begins; albeit by rebuking the Empire. Neat way of going back and exploring it from this stance. Refreshing even. Again, not sure why the whiners are whining here... LOL.5) You see cool new ships, droids, great CGI, spunk, and in reality, the unique side of the Empire where it almost promotes the 'Starship Trooper' scope in this universe and you wonder, could it be bad? Don't worry, the subtle scenes show it's not quite possibly that great an idea. 6) Okay, HERE'S the negative. Though I don't mind Woody Harrelson, and he doesn't do a bad job, he doesn't do a good job either. This niche is not for him. In addition, I literally hate it when big, old stars are implanted into SW films... remember Mace Windu anyone? Impressed; weren't we?? No. Just make a call and your in the film. This is why, thank goodness GL is NOT in control of this and the creativity here after. However, SW was BUILT on no names, GL said it himself so why not keep it going? Okay, so some of you are thinking what about Emila Clark. Fair to a point. She's still getting going and primarily 'known' for GOT where as her Terminator run was a fail, mostly. In any sense, SW is built on NO NAMES and it 'should' be kept that way for the viewer to appreciate and learn about the character as a whole on these journeys... just my thoughts. And then there's the Millennium Falcon. Did someone go to sleep on this? Clearly not the original. Does it get 'rebuilt'?? Not sure why it's so different and clearly not following the MOST recognized model aside from a Tie Fighter and the X-Wing. I can only hope Ron Howard's vision is to tell that part later but if 'not' then he failed miserably into the design that is the CGI image you see. Shame then on you RH for failing one of the most iconic images in the SW universe.7) Great music, characters, CGI and diversity. Not a winner at the film awards at the end of the year but I give certain kudos to Ron Howard for coming in and working a story that was failing and made a good film out of it. There is no Jar-jar stupidity here, though some of the story line could be slowed down just a smidgen more to understand the characters a tad bit better. Nice, quick reprisal of Warwick Davis too... Overall a winner but I won't be waiting in line to go buy the Blu Ray version as if my life depended on it. Good job though...so to those whining; don't listen to them! Go watch it and enjoy an entirely new concept!Cheers!",Solo - A Star Wars Story
873,tk-to-dj,A Shaky Start But It Does Get Off The Ground,7,30 May 2018,"Making this film wasn't easy, with production problems, reshoots, the original directors dropping out, it was on course to a disaster. But watching it on the big screen, it's surprisingly entertaining. Ron Howard's ""Solo: A Star Wars Story"" is a pretty smooth piece of entertainment. We find out how Han got his surname; how he first met Chewbacca (Joonas Suotamo) how he won the Millennium Falcon in a card game from Lando Calrissian (Donald Glover). We learn about Qi'ra (Emilia Clarke), Han's first love. We meet Tobias Beckett, Woody Harrelson, always enjoyable to watch. We have Dryden (Paul Bettany) who plays the mob crime-lord and is very well suited for a Bond villain.It does take a while for the story to actually get to the point and the film doesn't dip into a lot of characters stuff. It's a shame C3PO and R2D2 weren't in the film. I mean Rogue One was able to squeeze that in. The Lead Pirate Scavenger was a disappointment and there's no explanation why there's a space octopus floating around in space. But with all those negatives, it doesn't stop me from enjoying the film. Solo a Star Wars Story has a shaky start but It does get off the ground. They do leave the door open for a potential sequel. Certainly not the best Star Wars movie but it still entertained me.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
874,forchennfederation,"Was This ""Han Solo"" Solo Movie Really Necessary?",5,20 June 2018,"Speaking as a Star Wars fan who has at least liked the previous three Star Wars movies (Yes, I even liked the controversial Last Jedi), I was never all that excited about Solo: A Star Wars Story because I felt like we never needed a prequel/spin-off detailing the origins of the beloved intergalactic smuggler. However, seeing as how I am a devoted-enough fan to be willing to give any Star Wars film a chance, I gave Solo a chance and went into it with cautious optimism. And, I was totally right for being cautious, because Solo was kind of ""meh"" and, if I'm being honest, that was pretty much what I thought it was gonna be. So, now, let's go a lil' further into why I feel this way.I do have good things to say about this movie, so I figure I'll start from that. First off, the cast, overall, was fine. Alden Ehrenreich was pretty solid as a younger, less-experienced Han Solo; he's no Harrison Ford, but I feel like he didn't need to be because this is Han Solo from a different period in time than when he saw him in the original trilogy, and I don't blame Ehrenreich for not being on par with Ford because he was given the impossible task to try to portray a character who is so iconic as a result of Ford, so Ehrenreich made the role his own and he did it well enough. Donald Glover was really good as the young Lando Calrissian; nothing like Billy Dee Williams but, much like Ehrenreich, Glover still manages to pull it off for the most part, to where he even manages to pull off a dramatic scene at one point. Paul Bettany is also good as the villainous crime boss, whom Solo and Beckett (Woody Harrelson) work for, despite his limited screen-time. The rest of the cast (Harrelson, Emilia Clarke, etc.) were just fine; none of which stood out as great nor awful. Han and Chewbacca's relationship and chemistry is pretty solid; there's some banter between them that did get some chuckles from me (although one of them, which was shown in the trailer, never made it to the final cut, which was kinda disappointing) and their first meeting was handled pretty well. Ron Howard's direction in the action scenes is good, especially in the train sequence and the Kessel sequences, and the effects work is pretty strong, although I do wish that there was less of that ""foggy"" look going on that makes scenes in this movie look like there's a barbeque party going on with someone's grill running (That's the best way that I got to describe it, so hopefully you get what I mean).The movie is, at the very least, watchable; there's entertainment to be had in the movie.
However, with all those positive vibes being expressed, Solo: A Star Wars Story doesn't really rise that much above being watchable. I couldn't say that the movie was really that boring to me, but I never felt much wonder or awe or even surprise in what was happening, especially in the plot which I found to be kind of predictable (I'll get to the twists later down here). And, even though I tried to leave the feeling of how unnecessary this movie was out the door, the movie itself didn't do much to keep that feeling from happening at points. Another thing that I didn't like in the movie was L3-37, Lando's personal droid who is pretty much an SJW who's all about ""droid rights;"" not only was it so obvious in what the writers were going for with that character that it bordered on being obnoxious but it was also just the same-old, same-old funny droid sidekick that we've gotten in Star Wars, like C-3PO & R2-D2 from the original trilogy, BB-8 from the sequel trilogy, and K-2SO of Rogue One, but not executed very well; the one scene between L3 and Lando that was heartfelt was the one scene involving that character that legit worked for me and that was mainly because of Glover making it work emotionally. The opening scene of the movie also brought in something that I honestly hated looking back, and that was where Han Solo got his last name; it's like, why couldn't Solo be just a family name of his instead of just some name that was he was given by some guy?Now, let's talk about the many twists in this movie, and this is where we get into the more spoiler-y side of things so you've been warned. Of course, it's to be expected that a heist movie like this would have some twists and turns, but this movie, I feel, had a few too many. I didn't mind the twist where Beckett betrays Han, because it at least gave Han some development when he shoots first and kills the guy who was the closest thing to being a mentor figure for Han; it was predictable, yes, but it worked. Then, there's the other twists. Enfys Nest, a side-antagonist who shows up every now and then for a bit to cause our heroes trouble, revealing himself to be a young girl, who leads a group of other rebels like they're the kids from Beyond Thunderdome, who is trying to forge a rebellion; it was a lame twist because not only was it for a character that I didn't even care about and one that, I felt, seemed very tacked-on but the whole ""birth of the rebellion"" thing has been done to death at this point, to where I'm like, ""We get it. Move on;"" Han Solo contributing to these kids' plans for a rebellion in some way was also lame, because it renders his reluctance in joining the Rebel Alliance in the original trilogy almost null in void because by this movie's logic he's already contributed to the rebellion. Now, the big twist: There is a bigger crime boss, who's above Paul Bettany's character in the chain of command, who takes Emilia Clarke's character, Qi'ra, in as a sort of 2nd-in-command after she betrays and kills Bettany's character only to betray Han as well, and then the bigger boss reveals himself to be Maul (That's right, Darth Maul); at first, I was surprised, but then the more I processed it the less I liked it, because, first off, why would Maul get involved in the criminal underworld when he has bigger fish to fry, like tracking down Obi-Wan for revenge or seeking revenge against Palpatine? Second off, how are casual viewers supposed to be excited about the return of a character who they probably thought ""was as dead as a door nail"" since the end of The Phantom Menace, especially when they might not have seen or are even aware of Maul's presence in the Clone Wars and Rebels cartoon? Third, I can't get excited about a sequel because I can't see where this whole thing with Maul is gonna go from here without it somehow messing with the continuity, especially when I'm even aware of how his story in the cartoons (which I guess are considered canon at this point) ends. And, fourth and finally, I find it odd that LucasFilm, or whoever came up with this, thinks that bringing in a character from the prequel trilogy, which is not all that well-loved by people or Star Wars fans, is used to get people on board with trilogy of Han Solo movies, which no one, except Kathleen Kennedy, I guess, has asked for.So, overall, even though that last paragraph goes on for so long with that lil' rant there, I don't hate Solo: A Star Wars Story, but I'm not a fan of it either. I can honestly say that it's the first time, for me, since the Clone Wars movie back in 2008, where I didn't feel all that excited or wowed by a Star Wars movie; even the prequels have wowed and excited me at a few points at least. And, like the 2008 Clone Wars movie, I can't see myself revisiting Solo anytime soon, if ever. I recommend a Redbox rental, a viewing on Netflix, or a viewing on cable television for Solo, so that much I can give it. Solo isn't terrible nor is it great, it's just average and that, to me, is sad because a Star Wars movie should be better than average. And, to close this, I'm not even excited for any more Star Wars anthology movies (And, I adored Rogue One and I found that it actually added something to the franchise, especially the original trilogy), seeing how this one turned out, so I can't see myself seeing another anthology movie in the theater again because whatever LucasFilm and Kathleen Kennedy plan next in that field is probably not gonna get me excited at this point.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
875,judeknicks,"A great, fun movie that feels more like the classics",8,4 July 2018,"When I first heard this movie was coming out, I thought it was unnecessary and just another cash grab (which instead became a box office bomb), but I was still interested in watching it. I have been a Star Wars fan for a might long time. The first time I watched it with my homies in Baltimore, I hated it. However, two weeks later in Georgia, I watched it again and liked it very much. In fact, I almost loved it. How did I not like it the first time? I must've been high on something. Oh right, I was high on stupidity. But now that I really like the movie and will be watching it a third time soon, I'll summarize why.Initially, my complaints about the film were its lack of humor, pacing, and the performances by Han Solo himself (Alden Ehrenreich) and Lando (Childish Gambino who can almost do no wrong). After the second viewing, the initial problems with the movie were actually its positives. The direction is fantastic, which each scene following after the other in an orderly, comprehensive matter. I dislike when films skip between and settings between different characters, but since the focus is mainly on Han, the movie progresses with his development. The performance from Solo himself was amazing, as he was cocky and arrogant yet charming and entertaining. To enjoy a movie, you need a strong central character who balances humor and personality. That's something that was missing from the hero of Black Panther, but I don't want to trigger the internet and start a race war against Indians.When I asked people, mainly Star Wars fans, whether or not they would want to watch this movie. Most said no because they weren't interested in paying $15 to watch a movie about how the events that made Han Solo legendary played out when they already know what allowed him to earn his fame. That is an understandable reason, but to see how it all happened made for a very fun and interesting movie. In fact, I would place Solo among the top three of the ten Star Wars movies (behind Rogue One and Revenge of the Sith). If my top three conflicts with yours, I'll just say this: my top three is better.Forget my cockiness; it's all for show. The point is, it's really unfortunate that Solo failed to make a lot of money because it really was one of the best movies I've seen this year. The premise may seem like a money-grabber, but it really has heart and purpose, with a good message and a character with change. For the real Star Wars fans, it all teases a big future with more crossovers and references. No franchise does world-building better than the Star Wars franchise. I say, I'd give Solo: A Star Wars Story an 8.5/10, which means it is worth your $12, $2, and your time. In fact, it's worth your $20. A worthy investment, just one that shouldn't be overplayed or else the novelty will wear off.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
876,seansnowden8,I was there in 1977 and felt it again.,8,31 December 2020,"This episode is way more funny than the slog of Star Wars films. Solo is crafty in its dialogue, almost crude at times and the droids, aliens, monsters, opposing forces, et cetera give new life to Star Wars. I thought the pace and action of the movie is extra ordinary, with seat of your chair sequences. The landscapes and digital artistry at many moments in the film make you feel like a different galaxy exists, Some of the original sounds from the original Star Wars are used to keep the older nerds attune and engaged throughout. More than one Wookie, and Droids with crushes, gargling mud to sound like Chewy...hilarious. There are double crosses, twists, great battle scenes, just enough gooey sap between Han and his main squeeze, the chess table of animated creatures, The Millennium falcons damage to show its been through asteroids, monster chases, gravity pits, this film was awesome and fun, and worth it.

It wasn't until I walked by the poster on the way into the theater that I was like ""That dude doesn't even look anything like Han Solo... then again if you saw his son... I mean really? There's something wrong in that gene pool. Just sayin', ya know?"" However, kudos for getting his idiosyncrasies down. Not bad, not bad at all.I personally thought it had a decent story and had a decent timeline that allowed it to keep a decent sense of continuity throughout the film. Except for that 3-year gap, though necessary for Qi'ra's character development, it seemed a bit long for anyone to wait before even attempting to do what they intended to do.
That gap is where all the questions really start to originate from.Then you get the dead come back... I have no clue from where?

884,nealoade,"Absolutely great, if a little meaningless.",6,5 October 2018,"I boycotted this film in the cinema, upset by Rian Johnson's narrative choices in The Last Jedi. Even more upset by the TLJ production team's reaction to critics like me, not opposed to better representation in SW nor evolving the franchise in new ways, simply not liking it. Enough is enough, I thought. Why support a franchise who's producers call me a man-baby and talk of meeting fan-expectations as a bad thing?I am surprised, in context of all that, at how hard Solo: A Star Wars Story worked to win fans over. I haven't seen a film so eager to please in a long time.It is a breathless rush through the Star Wars Universe. This works against it after the first act. It suffers from pacing issues having thrown too many ideas against the wall. Lucasfilm alumni Ron Howard's direction however sees each plot point click into place with the satisfaction of a completed jigsaw. If you've seen Arrested Development you'll know that squeezing far too many ideas into small time-frames is sort of his area of expertise. He nails it.This Sci-Fi actioner is ambitious in plot, but goes completely by-the-book as far as originality of ideas is concerened. I wouldn't call it particularly derivative, but it stands in direct contrast to TLJ's compulsive need to not do the thing you think it's going to, and then not do that thing either. It does ""the thing"" most of the time, bar a little a-ha moment at the end, but largely tries not to cause any trouble. This results in a neither good-nor-bad reaction from me for a lot of the film's core narrative.The script is well thought out and uses bathos at the right times (unlike, imo, The Last Jedi). It is a fast paced movie, but it does take the time to explore most characters, new and old, and make them engaging. This includes Solo himself, who they've taken great care to reverse engineer and teach him all the life lessons he ever learned in this one little film, making up his personality in the original films in a logical way.Performances are great - really great. Ehrenreich (previously unknown to me) makes up for what he lacks in physical resemblance to Ford by mirroring his tone and mannerisms superbly. He throws everything he has at occupying Harrison Ford's space and he sold me completely. He truly was a young Han Solo. Donald Glover as Lando injects some of his own personality into the role, but succeeds in creating his Billy Dee Williams-a-like, and is so charismatic in his own right that it works. Harrelson is Harrelson, Newton is Newton (both amazing), Paul Bettany is a very convincing crime-lord and Phoebe Waller-Bridge is surprisingly warm and quite funny as a Star Wars droid like no other.An utterly likeable Sci-Fi actioner that doesn't say much about anything, conjures the originals well and refuses to rock the boat. If that's all you're looking for in Star Wars, here it is. It's not what I'm looking for ultimately, but I regret - in fact, I deeply regret - having now seen it, not going out and supporting it upon its initial release. Solo deserves better.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

886,mooviesuniverse,Solo lacks soul,5,27 July 2018,"The latest installment in the Star Wars Universe takes us to the streets of Corellia where a young Han (Alden Ehrenreich) and his girlfriend Qi'ra (Emilia Clarke) plan to make a daring escape to a better life. It's the starting point of an overlong action-packed adventure.It's no secret that the production suffered some difficulties. Directors Phil Lord and Christopher Miller were fired, Ron Howard was hired and they had to reshoot almost the entire movie which made it very expensive. Unfortunately the end result is quite underwhelming.After episodes 7 & 8 (and 'Rogue One') the nostalgic effect starts to wear off and then there's not much there really. There's no big plot and no tension whatsoever. The movie falls short as an origin story simply because we don't find out an awful lot about Han Solo that we didn't know already.
The movie starts promising on Corellia but what could have been a Blade Runner like setting is a messy, too dimly lit world led by a weird fish lady. The fishwoman is one of many forgettable characters. The action sequences look good (especially the train robbery) but not mind blowing either.The big question is of course the performance of Ehrenreich. He does an admirable job. Although his Han is too much of a good guy for our liking he's still young and the cynicism probably comes later. He's not Harrison Ford but you can't hold that against him.
Woody Harrelson (Beckett) and Paul Bettany (Dryden Vos) do their job but nothing special. Emilia Clarke isn't really convincing.
Donald Glover however stands out as Lando Calrisssian. Glover oozes charisma and is everyting you want Lando to be.There are few certainties in life but one of them is that the music in Star Wars is always great. It's no different here. John Powell provides perhaps the best score out of the ""new"" Star Wars movies.The surprising ending will leave some in shock/awe, others confused.

889,nikcoppin,Going Solo,6,22 June 2018,"I went to see this film on my own. So I guess I technically went to see Solo solo.Not too bad. But yet another Star Wars story that for me, underwhelms.Harrison Ford's shoes on such an iconic movie character from such hugely popular films were always going to be hard to fill, but Alden Ehrenriech grows into the part and gets a bit more likeable as the story goes on.I would say he gets away with it.His love interest - because there always seems to have to be a love interest - would've been much more fun if she would have brought her dragons over from Game of Thrones, but there is enough intrigue surrounding the journey she has been on to get where she is, as well as going forward, to keep her interesting.Of course there are the usual action packed sequences with laser beams flying all over the place that never seem to kill the most important characters in any such scene.And of course there are a number of backstabbings and doublecrossings that you would expect to be surrounding a back story around one such as Han Solo.The origins of the relationships Mr Han had with the likes of Chewbacca and Lando Calrissian all seem a little contrived and ham-fisted to me and his love interest I didn't really care for given we all know how his relationship develops with Princess Leia later on in his life anyway.There are some interesting new characters like Beckett played by Woody Harrelson, but it's hard to care about them and in general anybody in the movie. Add to this Paul Bettany's rather unconvincing scar-faced Arch-villain and it's all starting to look a little bit pedestrian.For me, just another underwhelming Star Wars story movie that is worth watching for its action and set pieces, but nothing worth running to the cinema for.I was left thinking just how many of these movies are they going to churn out before absolutely nobody gives a shit about them anymore?",Solo - A Star Wars Story

I mean he gets to the end of the difficult part, then turns around and has the stupid as hell sequence that follows. Ok so lets put that to one side.Qi'ra story arc.

What the hell, did they specifically get the writers from GOT to write another out of the blue implausible and stupid change of character for another Emilia Clarke role?Han speaking 'wookie' Ok it makes perfect sense, because in a New Hope its clear he can communicate with an understand Chewie, but it just was cringe worthy in its deleivery.

Lets do a little maths here (because the people writing this movie didn't). If Darth Maul is still alive it means its pre Phantom Menace. At that time Anakin Skywalker is like 8 years old. Let us be really generous and say that Han is 25 in Solo. So Anakin has Luke at say 18, that would make Han 43 years old WHEN LUKE IS BORN. If Luke is 18 when he meets Han, Han would now be 61. How did no-one see this coming, how did no-one notice that the timeline makes no sense.Crimson Dawn.

You cannot create a bad guy feeling out of thin air.Chewie in an elevator with Woody Harrelson (because I don't care for his name). How is that next scene not Chewie ripping his arms off?But credit where credit is due, Han was too bumbling and stupid all movie, I was glad that he finally became competent in the last act, his actual cross-double cross worked well.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
894,MikeyLikesIt_357,"Ok movie, but gives concern for the future",6,4 June 2018,"Don't get me wrong, I think THIS movie was more or less fine. The actors all did a good job, the CGI was good and the story was ok. I'm just really concerned that Disney will continue pumping out ""ok"" Star Wars movies for the next 20 years. 
 
And that's the main fault with this movie, it was just ok. Growing up watching Star Wars I always felt that the movies were grand spectacles of that particular universe. The characters, scenes, ships and dialogue were ALL so deeply seated in the Star Wars lore that they couldn't possibly represent anything else. Solo was a pretty decent heist movie that, with a few tweaks, could have fit any generic sci-fi mold and that's NOT what Star Wars is supposed to be. Solo never had that defining ""moment"" that all other Star Wars movies have had. In Rogue One it was when the Rebel fleet jumps into the Scarif system and when Vader goes all slicey dicey with the rebels. In Solo I never had that moment that made me say, ""Yep, THIS is a Star Wars movie!""I just hope Disney won't continue to pump out generic Star Wars movies that are ""just ok"".",Solo - A Star Wars Story

Solo, however, knows that it's an unnecessary film, but that's the point. Out of all the things Solo messes up, at least it understands that. Even if it tells the backstory of two characters from the Skywalker Saga, it simply exists to tell its own story, divorced from the main saga.

The movie rocks along at a similar pace and makes me reminisce to episode IV. It is great fun, loyal to the series, much more fun in fact than the current star wars episodes that are being dished out. This is a great sideline with vibrant characters, fun onscreen space chases, the infamous kessler run and hope people recognise this regardless of the Disney politics which people are jumping on. Great way to introduce Chewie and Han and Donald Glover is loving every minute of Lando. I would be keen to see where this goes.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

I agree that Han Solo is a cinamatic giant but that doesn't mean that a new actor for a household character should be shot down! I personally really liked the way they showed Han in his younger years. And it really established his bond towards Chewbacca! Beside this the only downfall for this movie is the pacing. The movie is over 2 hours but the input is to little to fill those hours. But if your a fan of the original movies you would Definitly like this flick!

To start with Alden isn't too bad but he lacks the roguish charm of Harrison, also he is revered to many times as 'boy' or 'kid' yet he looks like he's in his 30's! Plus no chin scar origin which would've been nice! Secondly I believe we have a new contender for most annoying character ever L3 has taken JarJars crown! Thirdly no real villain, paul bettany as always delivers a great performance but only so much he can do with poor writing and basically a lack of a decent story. Ok so we get answers to the Kessel run and how Han got the falcon, plus a nice meeting between Han and Chewie but storywise nowt seemed to grab my interest. What's all this about Han and his gold dice, am I missing them once the original trilogy or is this just a weak nod to last jedi same with the let's mention scariff to tie in with the far superior Rogue One! The characters lacked emotion and depth and the ending! Well, how is Darth Maul alive and ignoring that why did me need to fire up his sabre?

It fell just short in so many areas that it kind of feels like it is better suited to being a trilogy with The Ewok Adventure and Caravan of Courage.Whether or not the back story of Han Solo needed to be told or not, if the movie had been better than RS:ASWS then it may have shut critics up and actually gone some way to heeling the wounds from last years abysmal TLJ.

I've read a few reviews on here and to many people comparing current cast against the original cast members This is grossly unfair considering one of those we are talking about is a Star Wars ""God"" in Harrison Ford. The film itself is forgettable though it contains some nice shots of the Falcon and I thought Dryden was a good character. One ""Droid"" ruined this film for me and is the reason I would never buy it on DVD, I have every other film, L-3 I think was the name, like JAR JAR before it, it wasn't funny and is a huge reason the film wont be liked",Solo - A Star Wars Story

The same way people will tell you, you're not allowed to like the prequels.I thought Solo: A Star Wars Story did everything it needed to and more. A big fun action/heist movie with scintillating twists, turns, and heart I didn't expect. Why did there ever need to be anything more to a Solo movie?Solo satisfies on every level.

There were some stupid or over the top scenes, but I managed to ignore them. The only thing that bugged me throughout the whole film was Han's Dices which the Director keeps rubbing in our faces way too much. It feels undeserved from the Director to want of us to care about them..Saying that, I want to really say: That movie is fun, interesting, universe-expanding and doesn't feel as long as it actually is, which is always good with 2 hour-long movies.

On top of this the story is also good and entertaining, characters are also ok and believable.

918,ButterJuggets666,It could have been better. Also radical fembot is radical.,4,30 May 2018,"SPOILER: This review contains spoilers, molds, mildews, fungi, and microbial lifeforms.I decided to give this movie a shot, primarily because I wanted to watch the internet reviews without spoiling the film ;) My brother told me to turn off my brain while watching but that becomes difficult when you see a radical fembot preaching viva el revolucion like one of Fidel Castro's communist propaganda posters.You know it's not good when the only reason you want to watch a film is in order to watch internet reviewers take a crap on it. And though I didn't think the movie was as bad as the movie reviewers made it out to be it still has its flaws. The special effects were fine, but at this point the special effects aren't really special. Could it be that the novelty of special effects has worn off? That at this point billion dollar companies like Disney are able to churn out these state of the art elite special effects with practical and CGI usage? 
We need to focus on how the special effects are used and not how they look. We need to focus on the most important part of the movie, the story, and the characters, and how the elements of the stories actually work together in the film. And also maintaining a consistent logic through the film. As for the story in Solo, it felt rather quick, like it jumps from point A to point B, all was really fast and certain things felt left out, like could we have at least seen a montage of Solo's career during his three year stint at the Empire? Solo says that he was kicked out of piloting school for being rebellious, why not show us that scene? Why not show his relationship to the empire? Han grows in the film as he learns to anticipate backstabbing and learns to shoot first, understanding the thug life. (However again I need to stress that we have no idea what experience Han may have picked up from his Imperial training because it was breezed over.) I have to say this film forced him to be a rather quick learner. We get his gun, we get his meeting with Chewbacca but they seemed rather tacked on. He feels to the side, smaller than the actual story going on. His relationship with Chewbacca doesn't really grow in this movie, and feels like a lost opportunity, as it stands the duo are more partners than good friends. Chewbacca himself, is no longer the scruffy mechanic type you see in the original trilogy, but more of an allegory for slavery. Yay topical politics.........Mainly Chewbacca stands around and frees other Wookies, not even really getting any screen time for himself to make the occasional comedic jab --save for that scene of holo-chess. And a shower scene, because we needed to see that in a Star Wars movie. Lando....he was fine, for the four scenes he was in. Also I have to say that his love life must be pretty bad if he has to resort to a sex robot. The female character played by Emilia Clarke.....I can't remember her character's name in the film..... grows to be the stereotypical female bada$$ that we often get in contemporary films these days. She's in charge, she's....actually how she went from a pauper to a second in command for a crime lord would make just as interesting a movie....too bad we can't develop characters and need to just skip three years. May I go off on a tangent......thank you..... whenever you see text on the screen that says ""three years later"" or ""Indonesian jungle"" or ""London England"" when Big Ben is staring you right in the face. I want you to get up and say out loud, ""Wow the guy who wrote this must think I'm a F#cking idiot! "" It's really lazy writing to not develop the character of Han Solo in those three years with at the very least a montage. As for my example of a random Indonesian jungle? If something takes place in a random wilderness you don't need to know the exact location. As for famous cities, let the dialogue, or the visuals tell you where it's taking place. However, because films tend to jump from place to place these days without any lead up to it, I guess I can't blame them. Why don't you shoot a scene or too that leads into the location!!! Sorry, my tangent is over now. Her relationship with Solo seemed somewhat superficial in that plot device and coincidence still plague the Star Wars films, while lacking the charm that the original films may have had in those situations. Perhaps it's the change in tone, while the original trilogy had a mystical, hopeful tone that would forgive serendipity and plot device, these new, gritty, cynical films turn serendipity into a disbelief on the part of the audience. For example, the hope and awe you feel looking at a twin sunset, is not present in this darker more foreboding film. And so when Luke or Han just so happen to do something in the fun films it's funny, but in these darker films it clashes with the tone. Dark and Gritty is not always the answer and when trying to apply this to a Star Wars film one begins to lose the tone that made it popular in the first place. 
It saddened me to no end that I actually saw a critic praise the last Jedi film on Rotten Tomatoes for exchanging the hopefulness of those original films for the cynical times of today. Dear Hollywood, can you forget about Donald Trump for a change and try to make us laugh again? Also dear Critics why don't you retire to your chateau and drink your cognac in peace?Then there was Woody Harrelson as another character I can't name off the top of my head, he did a great job, as sort of a scoundrel and mentor to Han, though again the film felt somewhat rushed. They could have made this film a little longer and it would have improved the relationship between the two. Han seems to care for Harrelson toward the end when he shoots him and completes the arc in his training as a criminal. Also Han shot first.... (eyes roll)There are too many characters in the film that get introduced and killed off in the very next scene. Not a good way to develop much other than to get people to where you need them to be. Say try writing the film before you make it, then take several years to edit it, that'll give you time to make it good. Another trope, is the group of good people who were originally perceived as the bad guys. We see this trope in the comical scene where the marauder leader turns out to be a small girl in a comically over-sized helmet (who I suspect might be a young Mon Mothma-- but more of a Dark Helmet). Using the portrayal of innocence in a young child is often a way to message who the good guys are. (Think Mad Max Fury Road) Regardless, the importance to Solo's characterization is that it foreshadows his good nature and eventual draw to the rebel alliance. I wish they could have been just marauders though, but I guess this film is burdened with having to find some way to connect the original trilogy to itself every chance it can get. Sort of like it's living in the shadow of something better and not really able to float on its own. The settings were interesting, though often so rushed through that we couldn't really get a good sense of the environment. I loved that Yog-Sothoth made a cameo and was eaten by a snoring Azathoth. Y'know I'd forgive Disney if they moved their deadlines a little further off so that they could spend more time making entertaining stories, instead of, well, churning out one a year.....I mean quality over quantity right?....Right? (Who am I kidding....$$$$$$$$$$)Fembot: If ever you needed proof that Disney is injecting contemporary political ideas into these movies on purpose, Fembot is that proof. Now Redlettermedia said this, but I also honestly thought this while watching the movie, could it be that Fembot is actually a parody of some of the more outspoken and annoying left wing groups out there today? I mean seeing a feminist robot demand equal rights for washing machines while acting like a the propaganda posters of Fidel Castro and using propaganda buzzwords like liberation, is somewhat on the nose to the point where you could laugh at it. However, the journalists are eating this detritus seriously, like roaches and flies. As for buzzwords and politics, to be honest it is the same thing the Empire does when they use buzzwords like ""Peace and Order"". Makes me chuckle inside when you realize that your heroes are also politically motivated terrorist guerrillas fighting politically charged Imperialist Nazis and that no side is good save for the side you root for. I always though that the new trilogy would have been better if the Republic became just like the Empire it fought against. These films are made by corporate suits and out of touch marketers who think that they know how to relate to the population while ham-fisting politic into the mix in order to pat themselves on the back as ""Good"". It's here to sell toys, and poorly at that, now even I can buy a Fembot for my nonexistant children....oh joy! It looks like they checked out a long time ago in giving a dam about interesting movies and now we see overly long commercials with refitted skins to sell a different type of storm-trooper. Long gone is the mono-mythic classic, now it rapidly merges with the watered down and overly safe ""art"" of today.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

It's definitely one of his lesser works because the story of Han Solo could have been so much more interesting and well made and this one felt kitchy and like a cheap knock off of the storied Star Wars franchise.The one scene that is somewhat intriguing was the battle scene after we are re-introduced to Han Solo following his military training.I enjoyed learning how Han Solo and Chewbacha were connected. How Han Solo got his name was a cheesy rip off on Don Corleone's name origin story.The 80s cocktail dresses and pumps in the bar scene in Beckett's ship was terrible costuming.Not an entirely terrible waste of entertainment budget, but definitely residing in the cellar of bad Star Wars franchises.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

Many ""oh . . . that is why"" moments and a huge harking back to the ""CANNON"" features. Who else to add to the story, than the writer the wrote the pivotal Ep 5 and 6. They bring familiar beats and situations that echos all to well, that makes one say, ""why?"" And is more a distraction to the story than is needed. Have to handed it to Howard to come on a film where it was going in one direction, and turning the ship to another and reshoot 80% of the film take a lot and he should be giving an award for that at least.

Darth vader and the jedi's worked like for good or bad.This was boring from the get go. There was no chemistry between anyone. Harison ford had chemistry with a guy in a Ghillie Suit. And he made it work. That is not there here. After a while it just got tedious and boring including the music which does not work. I see the 8 score and say no way. Dont they have any sense of rhythm? Nothing matches anything here. Also there was none of that anticipation of things to come, more like who cares.So my question still is, what did they do with the $300 million? When you saw the 5 minutes of matrix and they spent $30 mil on it, you could say yea I can see that..",Solo - A Star Wars Story

It's not going to win any best picture Academy Awards but these films never do. The VFX is first class, as always, and the production design is just awesome. Especially the early imperial trench warfare style stuff where you can see the early development of those weird stretched imperial helmets and goggles.The score is excellent dropping from the original pieces to the Millennium Falcon signatures themes from Star Wars and Empire during the infamous Kessel Run.Not sure what all the negative reviews are about, reading them I suspect they haven't even watched the picture.

935,slickr12345,Great as a separate movie,7,15 September 2018,"I really enjoyed this movie, even though I didn't think I will considering all of the critics and negative comments online about it. It was a really fun, really awesome sci-fi movie that would have scored higher if it wasn't about Han Solo.They could have had this exact same movie about a different person and it would have worked much better. The issue I have with how it is is that no one can replace Harrison Ford, he is Han Solo for me, and considering he was actually really young when the first Star Wars movie hit, I could not get away from thinking this new actor isn't Han Solo. I think they need to scrap all the movies about existing star wars characters and if they are going to do new movies along these lines do it with new characters.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
936,smanteufel,Fun's the word,8,27 May 2018,"Let's be honest here, for an origin story this film ended up with more questions than answers. (Again Spoilers - just making sure you get the warning)What's going to happen with Qi'ra? How did Beckett kill Aurra Sing? Where's Darth Maul fit into all of this between what happens in Clone Wars against Sidious; to his eventual return in rebels with Ezra? Clearly there are multiple gaps that still need to be filled, whether that be in the *yet to be confirmed* next Solo film, or in other media? Who knows?
One thing I can say is that this movie is fun. Alden makes for a decent younger Han; although at times the disconnect between his performance and that of Harrison Fords made me sometimes forget this was 'The Han Solo'. Nevertheless he was solid, and with Donald Glover pumping out a performance possibly even more devil-may-care than Billy D. Williams (seriously, who is cooler?!) the films acting performances were certainly true to form.Most importantly however, this felt maybe not like a traditional Star Wars story, but it certainly felt like the Star Wars universe. This film touched on the gritty underbelly that we've always known was there, and expanded on this mythology in a fun way. Yes the story was at times muddled and seemed to pack in a lot of story arcs resulting in quite a dense film, but the energy: particularly of planets like Correlia, felt all too familiar to underworld planets we fans have seen in the now 'Legends' since Return of the Jedi, and for me it's another welcome addition to the Star Wars mythos.
Again, the story was at times messy, lacking clarity in a lot of sequences; I personally would have liked to see Hans time with the academy explored: something more akin to his EU origin story, but I suppose times are a-changing. I'm also slightly perplexed by Chewbaccas motivations in hanging around, and there was nothing in this story that would really have warranted a life debt. 
But mostly I just look forward to seeing the next film: if we get one, where hopefully Darth Mauls leadership of the various crime organisations (forget Crimson Dawn, where's Black Sun?) can be fully fleshed out. It's also pretty likely that this next big heist on Tatooine will introduce Boba Fetts anthology film (crossover anyone?)
But yeah, in so few words, we aren't done with this story and so far it's been fun.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
937,jpr-reardon,A Solid Film For the Star Wars Franchise,7,11 May 2018,"I am not a Star Wars nut, nor do I know the lore associated with the backstory. This review is written from the perspective of someone who like Stars Wars movies and enjoys taking it all in. I was lucky enough to see an early preview of this film and it was really, really good. Alden Ehrenreich, Emilia Clarke, Paul Bettany, and Donald Glover all do extremely well in their respective roles. The Cinematography, like most of the new Star Wars films will simply blow you away. When you're watching the film it's almost as though you're there, experiencing each and every detail with them. In fact I believe I'll be watching it again on its wide release so I can catch some of the things I missed the first go round. The overall Plot-Line is good. It's mainstream, but its certainly not as cheesy/ludicrous as some of the other newer Star Wars films. I enjoyed myself, I enjoyed the film. Overall it was an 8/10 in my book. A good quality fun film.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
938,vovaparkour,"Good - Better than Last Jedi - Anyone giving under 5-6 hasn't seen it, or is hating",6,30 May 2018,"Look, I get it. The Last Jedi really screwed up a lot of things, and fans have to take action to try and restore balance to the force and everything else. But it's a shame that Solo: A Star Wars Story has to take the backlash, because this is actually a pretty good movie. And they did a lot of things right which should carry on to future movies. So I hope that Disney doesn't think that this movie performed poorly because it's a particularly bad movie, but it performed poorly because of what came before it: The Last Jedi; bad writing; self-righteousness and scapegoating by the franchise's writers, and so on. I would say this is about a 7/10, but I'm giving an 8 to slightly offset unreasonable haters who are treating this movie unfairly. It's a tough spot, just how it is.As for the movie itself, it becomes better and better as the movie goes on. First 10 minutes are a bit jarring and cringey as you acclimate to the new Han Solo, but you eventually grow to like him. Things accelerate as the action kicks in and characters are introduced, and we've got some gorgeous-looking sequences and great-looking people. There is a dip in parallel when a particular droid is introduced (just try to ignore, and enjoy all the other good stuff that's happening). Lando is pretty good, but could have been better. As the end approaches, there are a couple of twists, and there is no telling who will live or die (side characters obviously, who I must say are actually pretty likable), so this movie had tension and it was not that predictable. I walked into this movie hearing about all the hate, expecting a bad movie. But I was pleasantly surprised, and enjoyed it. And unless you are an illogical, irrational, blinded person, you will find yourself enjoying it too.I think Disney got the message with the bad opening weekend. Go and see this movie, support the cast and movie. Or wait till it's theater run is finished and buy the blu-ray. Either way, this isn't a movie you should avoid forever.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
939,casagrandicooper,Excellent exciting and exactly what we wanted,10,2 June 2018,"Here's the thing; this Solo is 10 years younger than the one we met in New Hope. That's the point. Whom of us we slicker, smarter, and more self assured 10 years ago than we are today? Or, thinking of Force Awakens, 50 years ago? No, it's not the Solo we know, it's the one we would have met if we'd had had a film before he shoots Greedo first. So, stop wanting a movie that isn't, and immerse yourself in the one that is. If you do, you get a great Rob Howard flick of someone running from a teen/young adult he was, to starting to emerge to the man we will eventually know. And, with all the hidden and not so hidden Easter Eggs and cross references, what we end up is a great story of a character who we already know, and can cheer for, even when he does shot first.

945,cbrownlaw-771-107746,SOLO - a missed opportunity,3,3 June 2018,"I am seeing many media reviews of why Solo did poorly. The review are stating that we are tired of Star Wars, that this was too soon. This was NOT too soon - just too blah. 
 What we are tired of is poor writing. Go back and re-watch Guardians of the 
Galaxy - 1 or 2. The type of funny dialogue with the action - THAT should be Solo. This Solo movie was sophomoric, missing every opportunity to be great. 
I LOVE Khalessi, or did, but her acting is just horrible here. 
The new Han Solo, as feared, was just a cheesy remake. The writing for Han was bad, and the acting of the bad writing was boring (not as bad as Khalessi, but bad). Don't get me wrong - Han Solo's original acting was bad as well (admit it), but certainly Harrison Ford had the compelling personality. 
Chewy - well, he was neat, but the liberation part, which could have redefined him in a good way - was just tossed off, poorly started and finished. 
Woody from Cheers - the flattest acting I remember from him. 
The only wonderful spot? A cloakroom in the Falcon (now that was cool), and Rio Durant - a really decent new alien.
Vision was the bad guy? How is Vision a dreaded, Star Wars bad guy? We go from Dearth Vader to Vision? And then somehow Khalessi goes all Kung Fu on him, out of the blue?
The animatronic monster from the moat - wow. That was just sad. 
We are NOT tired of Star Wars, but we do not go see bad movies over and over again. Star Wars has needed new writers for a while, and a new direction. Rogue One was wonderful, but other than that, I just wish it would stop. I am a lifetime Star Wars fan, and now the franchise is embarrassing me.

Since Disney seems to think that us fans hate the film because we hate diversity, I'll leave the characters out of it.

I am not going to spoil anything, but it's one of those moments where I felt like I was really experiencing a Star Wars story. 
I did not like 'The Force Awakens' neither did I like 'The Last Jedi' much, but Solo blew them all away!
It goes above 'Rogue One' for me, as it cuts down on 'annoying things' like running after a child to save her in middle of the gunfire and the already seen moments. A lot of twists and turns in 'Solo: A Star Wars Story', moments you'd not expect and it's also quite dark, as it is set in the gloomy time where Empire controlled majority of the places.Parents and I have thoroughly enjoyed it and we finally felt that old Star Wars vibe again.

Alden Ehrenreich had to nail Han Solo previously played excellently by Harrison Ford and I think he did a fairly good job although I wouldn't say he was perfect as Han.The film has a runtime of two hours and fifteen minutes but due to not so good pacing the film feels overlong and just bored me. The supporting cast is talented but the character work leaves much to be desired. Han Solo had a good story arc throughout the film and Donald Glover completely nailed the character of Lando Calrissian. Woody Harrelson is great but his character Beckett didn't really do much for me. Emilia Clarke's Qi'ra was also a pretty interesting character and Paul Bettany was pretty entertaining even though he had very minimal screen time. The film has some great vfx work that you would expect from a big blockbuster franchise like Star Wars. There are plenty of action set pieces and chases but nothing that stands out. I can't really remember much of anything when it comes to exhilarating sequences because there weren't any which is a bummer.

Partway through first one person, and then another couple, left.

963,siebertws-06430,"Enjoyable Escapism but Nothing Special. Miscast, Poor Cinematography.",6,5 June 2018,"""Solo"" is nothing special, it probably falls just about right in the middle of the ""Star Wars"" franchise. It drags badly in spots, but has its moments. But what surprised me the most was what I did and didn't like, and how it completely upended my expectations both ways. 1- Worst of all: The movie LOOKS BAD. This is the #1 problem with ""Solo."" Cinematographer Brandon Young keeps things dark, muddy, hazy, brown, washed out. There isn't a single scene that ""pops"" on screen and a couple action sequences are so dark I couldn't even tell what was going on. This dude should've been fired along with the original directors. Visually, the movie's a disaster. 2- Considering up to this point the guy could do no wrong in my book, I was shocked by how bad Donald Glover is as Lando Calrissian, and it's got nothing to do with his ""pansexuality."" The performance is all over the place. A few points, he appears to be doing a straight-up Billy Dee Williams imitation. In some parts, he seems to be trying to do his own thing. A few scenes are painfully goofy and he seems embarrassed.While I was expecting Alden Ehrenreich to be overmatched by his titular predecessor, it turns out Glover's the one who tanks it. HE's the smaller-than-life actor playing the larger-than-life character. Totally unexpected. 3- The episodic narrative flows organically enough, but the middle section drags badly with no emotional charge or excitement. This was where I felt, ""Okay, here we go, it's going off the rails."" But the story rallies and the last half hour is pretty good, with dramatic tension and two solid payoffs.4- There's minimal societal ""programming,"" but it's there. All the stuff with the ""woke"" ""female"" robot and Lando's love for ""her"" is wince-inducing. So bad. There's a reference that ""there's no difference between tribe and family,"" which I found an odd thing to say. But it's minimal, and not baked into the film like it was in the insufferably smug and legacy-hating TLJ. 5- Alden Ehrenreich isn't terrible. He's serviceable. He's not ""my"" Han Solo by any means, but he's not the absolute stink bomb I was expecting, either. After about a half hour, I was like ""Look, you can either go with what he's doing or not,"" and I decided to hop on, because at least it's an actor giving an actual performance. It's not Harrison Ford's Han Solo, not even close, but it's not the all-over-the-map mess Glover gives, either. Unfortunately, ""serviceable"" is not enough when your predecessor was Harrison Ford.6- Woody Harrelson and Paul Bettany are fantastic, though the former is now in ""Hey! It's Woody Harrelson!"" territory, where it's getting tougher and tougher to separate the actor from the role. Emilia Clarke, who I don't think is a very good actress, did a better job than expected.7- The best action sequence, a train robbery, comes early, which leaves the film feeling slightly anticlimactic afterwards. This sequence would have been even better if the cinematography didn't LOOK BAD. ""Solo"" suffered at the box office because ""The Last Jedi"" was so hated by so many people that Disney actually harmed the brand. ""Solo"" is actually a ton better than TLJ 
(except for the cinematography, WHICH LOOKS LIKE BAD), but that's the way it goes.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
964,TrackArtist8,Entertaining and correct movie spoiled at ending,6,12 July 2018,"I think it is important to know a movie context in order to evaluate it. This project has suffered a lot of problems in its making: director change, massive reshoots, budget increase, any image 3 months before its release, etc. I also didn't understand the need of this movie until a person who saw Episode IV in 1977 told me it would be great to see a movie of Han Solo's young adventures. It changed my point of view. With all these things, I went to cinema without any high expectations, just trying to enjoy the following two hours. I almost managed it.For the 95% of the time, I found what I expected: entertainment. Because I don't understand the high expectations with this movie. This movie is just a funny addition to Star Wars, to put image to those stories Han Solo told in the original trilogy. And it manages it. The atmosphere feels like the Star Wars universe. Creatures, weapons, environments, vehicles, everything is correct. There are quite interesting scenes, like the battle in mud, the train assault, or the very anticipated Kessel Run. Casting is correct, Ehrenreich and Glover do feel like young versions of the characters. Emilia Clarke does a decent job with her mischievous smile, hiding dark secrets, and they are powered with always good Paul Bettany and Woody Harrelson. Even the strange characters go dying for the sake of the movie. Also humour was well controled after Guardians of the Galaxy tone threat.Everything is going just ok. But unfortunately, things got wrong at the end. The last 10 minutes spoiled it all. They made a mistake I couldn't tolerate.Why Darth Maul had to appear at the end? Since Episode I, i have seen a lot of fanboys trying to get it back form the dead, bringing crazy ideas one after another. I was aware that Clone Wars and Rebels took him back, but all that things aren't important beacause Star Wars are movies, and other things are extra stuff. But this appearance the movie gives validity to all that crazy ideas. Why we can't afford Darth Maul was a decent villain a stop it there? This bad handled effective strike attempt only can confuse that people that always liked Star Wars but are not aware of comics, videogames, animation series, etc. This was a limit I wouldn't tolerate the day it happened, and so it was. The idea of Qi'ra having dirty deeds with the Dark Side to get out Corellia is cool, but Darth Maul was dead, beacuse if you are cut in half and thrown form 100 meters high, you are dead, no matter how powerful you are. The idea he survived 10 years being half a spider is just pathetic. Even the Emperor could have been a better cameo there.Also Enfys Nest and the riders, that seemed threatening and dangerous, lost everything just for another effective strike attempt, to show they were only angry children and slaves. At least they say the will join the rebellion.To end, the movie is just correct at 95%. There is my 6/10. But this is not a trascendent movie about Light and Darkness, and father and sons. This is just entertaining. Consequently I don't understand why Lucasfilm bases its box office results to decide about the future of Star Wars saga. The movie had a lot of problems in the making and its not a masterpiece, so I find fair its box office results, and they are no reason to freeze other 'A Star Wars story' projects. The nowadays principle of quantity=quality is not a good analysis tool. After four films of this new era, this movement seems to show us that there are no stories to tell, only the making money machine on, and that money is the only thing that matters. That is not Star Wars.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
965,abiecamacho-67729,Great!,7,17 September 2018,Lots of reasons why it didn't do well at the box office. All I know is Ron Howard did a great job considering he had to re-shoot 70% of the movie. I'd much rather see the prequels because they are forced to keep the stories in line. Great addition to the Star Wars franchise and a way to show us how our 2 most beloved characters in the franchise ( Han Solo and Chewbacca) actually met. Lando and the Melenium Falcon are great too.

The action is pretty solid (The Kessel Run is quite excellent), visuals are brilliant and a lot of the acting is good. Donald Glover in particular steals the film while Alden Ehrenreich does his best to capture the roguish, charismatic character of Han Sol that we all know and love.The only downside is the main plot and storyline.

I was so pulled in by the amazing job that Ron Howard pulled off that I forgot all about the Jedi. I figured the movie would suck without any Jedi Knights. I was seriously mistaken. I cannot understand any original Star Wars fan giving this a bad review. Now I just wish Ron Howard had done all the newer ones. The Last Jedi was not such a bad movie, but it was nothing like the original Star Wars and therefore was a huge disappointment. The other new ones were just so, so. This one was much, much better.At first I thought the lead actor did not look like a young Solo, but the more I watched it the more he seemed to fit the part perfectly. He wasn't as cynical, but then again he was very young and still had a lot of hard life to go through.Honestly, I expected this to be terrible and I did not even think about going to the theater to watch it. I regret it now. It would have been even better on the big screen.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

974,danhall86,Simple Summary: Watch it!,8,26 May 2018,"Let's keep this short and simple so you can read it and get on with booking your tickets.Best Things:
The relationship between Chewie and Han is on pointThe music by John Powell is the best Star Wars music in a very long timeIt's more fun than anything made since the original trilogy and has that pulpy adventure vibeThe characterization was accurate to the Han we know and loveWorst Things:
A derivative sequence which channels Star Trek a little too much, but that doesn't really bother meThe droid was a bit annoying, but I think it (she?) was intended to be. 
This is now my fourth favourite SW movie, after the original trilogy. I really liked it that much. And if you're wondering, yes ESB is my no. 1Ignore all the anti-Kathleen Kennedy hatred and the negative buzz around this film. It's everything a SW film should be (unless you really can't live without the force/jedi in a SW film).",Solo - A Star Wars Story

Han vows to steal enough money to buy a ship and get back to her.But then he meets her completely at random about 1/3rd of the way through the film and she's completely fine and working for the same crime boss as Han. (This is a ridiculous coincidence, but hey, maybe it's a small galaxy).And then their relationship goes literally no where for the rest of the film. It's like the writers just changed their minds about how the motivations would work and forgot to go back and rewrite anything.The whole movie is like that; it has no logic driving it. It's just a series of disconnected action sequences. And each action sequence is a mess. The only thing this film consistently does is pick unimaginative ways of connecting various pieces of existing SW lore into the story.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
976,caboooze,I thought I was going to hate the movie.,8,14 September 2018,"First some background: I was a hardcore Star Wars fan when I was a kid, and loved the originals. I must have watched them 50x each. Ever movie made since RotJ has been terrible in one way or another. Annoying characters, bad acting/scripts, unforgivable plot holes, destroying the original story.I didn't even bother seeing Solo in theaters, I just assumed it would be terrible, and the reviews reinforced that view.Well, while it wasn't perfect, it was actually a solid movie. The first 1/4 of the movie I kept looking for reasons to hate it, but in the end I came up empty. Harrison Ford is my favorite actor and I didn't think anyone would ever be able to fill his shoes but this Alden guy (I've never heard of) really did a great job with the character, so hats off to him. I actually enjoyed all of the characters quite a bit, which is nice for a change. There are lots of throwbacks to the originals, some of the original music made it in during key scenes, and there was just the right amount of humor. The only pretty weak bit for me was the ending/fight scene, and in the scheme of things it wasn't that bad, it just could have been better. The scale seemed all wrong, and it felt needlessly rushed.In summary - for me, it is the first solid Star Wars spinoff, and I feel that it sets the bar at the right place for more to come.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

I thought it would be a huge failure for Lucasfilms, but it didn't turn out bad.The main problem that did bother me was that the story is predictable. There are scenes when one moment happens, you'll know another moment will happen later. Or you'll know these kinds of characters will face these consequences. ""I'm not surprised this and that happened. I was expecting it sometime sooner or later anyway.""It's the feeling when you've already seen similar events that have happened from another movie before. But not bad I must say. Not bad.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
978,jason_wisdom,"Good, not great, not really a Han Solo prequel",5,12 September 2018,"I love the Star Wars franchise, although like many lifelong SW fans I have my gripes with the prequels, gripes with certain elements of VII and VIII, and I liked Rogue One.Solo is 5/10. I think Donald Glover is great, Ron Howard did a commendable job bringing order to the galaxy, Alden Ehrenreich and Emilia Clarke are solid, etc. The acting is good. Han and Lando show real chemistry. Love the surprise guest appearance at the end. I'm even okay with a major character's pansexual element.On the other hand, Han is a lot more ""sensitive and feeling guy"" all throughout this movie, than he ever was during any part of Episodes IV, V, and VI. Mr. ""He's the brains, Sweetheart!"" lets his woman make the big decisions?? The original Han Solo was a sexist pig scoundrel, and only an equally hard-headed Leia was able to break through his shell and reveal an actual human heart in there. How does Solo's character development of Han, who is not a scoundrel in any way, fit in with the Episodes IV-V-VI character development of Scoundrel Han? It doesn't. At all.Unfortunately, this movie does feel like a rushed script. As Ronald Reagan used to say about his B movies, ""They didn't want it good, they wanted it Thursday."" Woody Harrelson's character really did not show any real character development, he just went out of character. Too many important plot items were just skimmed over--gambling, famous millenium falcon run, Han's ahem education, and more. There are a handful of good moments, and honestly I liked the film as a standalone flick when I walked out of the theatre. There are also more than a handful of ""cmon, man..."" aspects of the film and as a Star Wars fan, I think this could have been much better as part of the SWU.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

980,jresker,Don't believe the bad reviews,9,2 June 2018,"I absolutely love Star Wars. I have ever since my childhood after watching the originals with Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford and Carrie Fischer. I wasn't the greatest fan of episodes 1,2, and 3, but I've learned to appreciate them in their own right as a trilogy which lays down the back story of Vader, the fall of the Republic and the rise of the Empire. I'm a huge fan of the clone wars and believe they are some of the best thing that ever came out of the Star Wars universe. I see Rebels similarly but not quite the same way as the Clone Wars. I loved the fresh new look of Rogue One and the brilliant display of real warfare in the film. As for episodes 7 and 8, I'm learning to appreciate them in their own right for the generations that have come after George Lucas introduced SW to the world. As for Solo - I'm astonished by the lack of appreciation so many fans seem to have of this film. I think it was outstanding - possibly one of the best live action films to date. Unlike many SW fans I don't see the originals as all that impressive when it comes to film making. There were a lot of holes in the story line and the SW universe seemed rather empty and boring until episodes 1-3 were introduced. With the Clone Wars the SW universe became even more expansive! With Solo I feel it blended the best of all these films together in one solid performance! The cast was great! The story was great! The action sequences had me riveted to my seat! The romance, the droids, the rise of the rebellion were all there! I'm worried many so-called Star Wars fans are becoming little more than a social class of whiners and complainers who can't find satisfaction in anything new; unable to adapt to the evolution of the film genre. I think Solo gives the franchise a revival of hope and one that sees the opportunity for new adventures to be limitless!! The only reason I didn't give Solo a 10 was because I'm a big fan of R2 and 3PO. But hey, maybe that's the part of me that can relate with some of the saps out there that fail to recognize a great film when they see one. I only wish I would have been able to see it sooner on opening weekend. I'm definitely going to see it again with friends.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
981,mariuswmadsen,Not quite fulfilling,6,29 September 2018,"Solo feels more like an episode in a good tv show, instead of a chapter in a complex film saga. The story is just too light and narrow for the Star Wars universe.The cinematography is beautiful, the acting is good and there's plenty of action for you to eat popcorn to. But it just feels too distant from the events of the galaxy far, far away. The story simply does not feel important: Its basically ""How did Han Solo get the millennium falcon?"" - would you see an entire movie about that? 
Maybe more Darth Maul would've helped.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

983,digitalrep,Really enjoyable,8,26 January 2019,"I love the fact that Disney are breathing new life into this franchise. If they release a new Star Wars movie every two years I'd be thrilled.I love the fact that they are a socially conscious company that cares about issues like slavery (even robot slavery) and a company that has the courage to step up and use a diverse cast of actors, and to portray women as heroes for a change.And I think this is where all the hate comes from... From those people (white guys) who hate women, who resent women and don't want to see their picture perfect perception of reality to change. You know, the one where men are heroes and women are just objects... Pretty things to be looked at, silent and yielding. These guys hate to see women being portrayed as anything other than decoration. And they hate the feel bad about things like slavery and entitlement etc.So yeah, you can see why they'd be upset that the franchise, which was previously only really enjoyed by a rather small sub-section of the community (think Big Bang Theory) is now being enjoyed by a wide array of people from various walks of life.So let them hate. They are in the minority now. And I hope Disney keeps making heaps of movies - really, just churn them out one after the other. They are all brilliant in my opinion.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
984,ammonraa,It was going to be tough regardless,7,29 May 2018,"Where to start? While not anywhere near as good as the original trilogy, nor Rogue One, the movie is still far superior to the other clunkers put out in the last 20 years embarrassingly branded Star Wars films. Having said that here is the good and the bad:The good: Chewbacca. Everything from how he looks, moves and acts was perfect. So perfect in fact that I was surprised to find out it wasn't Mayhew I. The make up, his mannerisms and even his expressions were spot on. How he was introduced and how he and Han met was actually really enjoyable EXCEPT (more on this later). Lando: another excellent casting. There were times his voice and style were almost exact. He captured the character and stole every scene he appeared in. He made the entire movie worth watching. The BASIC storyline. Its not that bad. The problems weren't the story as much as it was the details (more on this later as well). Now the bad:Han. There was just no way to win this one. He's not Ford. Let's be honest, Ford isn't even Han anymore. While the actor got the swagger and there were some nice subtleties (like the striped pants, the blaster and the gun belt) some things were just over done. The effing dice need to go. The little homages to the originals are nice when they can go unnoticed. To point them out CONSTANTLY ruins their significance and meaning to the true fans that like these insider secrets. The other big issue is he in no way even remotely resembles HF. Additionally, he can't shoot it seems until the last scene and no one that is born of that sort of trauma is really that naive. Lastly. Wookiee?? Come on. Just have him speak English and understand Chewie. It's insulting and stupid. It very nearly ruined a great scene. It was unnecessary. The story. Why have we never heard of this extremely expensive and sought after energy source before now?? Couldn't it just as easily have been something everyone is familiar with?? Also, why must EVERYTHING that we know about the character of Han happen in one mission?? It's like everything interesting about him happened at the same time and then he just chilled out in a bar somewhere until we found him in Star Wars. The pirates. Why? They added nothing to the storyline OTHER than to illustrate Han's innate ""goodness"" and that of course totally ruins the redemption that happens in Star Wars (I refuse to call it a new hope. It's Star Wars. Period.). Emilia Clark: I love her in GOT but she is worthless as anything else and really cannot act. Her character was pointless as the betrayal was just as significant from Woody Harrison's character. It was just redundant at that point. Woody Harrison: should have been a smuggler. Could have been Talon Karrde(sp?). In essence, all the interesting characters of that crew were killed off nearly immediately. Darth Maul. I get that people want to see more of him but he really serves zero purpose. He's not part of the empire. He just doesn't fit in. Here is the big one. The Falcon. Why are we messing with perfection? Even after it was beat up a bit it still didn't look right. I would have been ok with the shielding being ripped off, everything being shiny and new or some of the other cosmetics but a lifeboat/escape pod? On the nose of the ship? I get that it looks like McQuarrie's original drawings but still, to take something iconic and screw with it... They ruined the concept of being the ""fastest hunk of junk in the galaxy"" by ""cheating"" with this new energy source jumpstart. Haven't we seen this very thing in a myriad of other venues?So while there are some pluses; its enjoyable and entertaining, the comedy is much like the originals AND it's better than 5 of the 6 latest movies, it still leaves A LOT to be desired.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
985,pgcarvajal,"Solid, Well-Paced",8,28 May 2018,"Before entering the theatre to watch this film, I was feeling very mixed about this film. My first thought was ""how are they gonna pull this off?"" About midway through the film, I realized I had a love for it! The acting was spot on, the pacing of the film was not slow at all. If you go into this film imagining that you're watching Harrison Ford and Billy Dee Williams as Han and Lando, you will be amazed. For once, I've finally witnessed a Star Wars film that I have not seen in the last 35 years. 
Solo brings heart to the theater, the story is fantastic, several references from its' predecessors are within the film, and the ending gives away that there will be a potential sequel. This film was nothing like the borefest that they call Rogue One. Solo started with action and ended with action and charm, much like the original trilogy. 
If you haven't watched this film, please do so if you are a fan or may be new to the series, it is tons of fun. I give this film a solid 8/10 for a great storyline, nostalgic action sequences, terrific acting, and of course a famous villain us fans know and love.

However, The Force is strong with this movie, so I thought I would give it a chance - I'm glad I did. Although not quite on a par with the story of Rogue One, I was drawn into the story and entertained throughout. I was unaware of the full cast, and the performances of Woody Harrelson and Paul Bettany certainly added quality and gravitas to this film. The production values were to the usual Star Wars standard.Aside from a dash of 'Disney-fication', where a little girl is unrealistically injected into a leadership role, in order to pander to children (please stop doing this - it doesn't work for Star Wars), this was a good movie.

990,wow3,Misleading title,6,25 May 2018,"The name should have been something else than Solo. For me a prequel film about one character almost made me not to see it. If the name had been Crimson Dawn 5 it would have sounded more positive. Now it has that baggage that brings. Luckily it avoided most prequel cliches or had fun with them.
It had followable story though it lost its meaning about halfway mark. Like going to get milk from store and remember you have one unopened in the fridge but you go in anyway. Certainly it had more of a story than Last Jedi or even Force Awakens. That's what Star Wars films need, simple plot populated with good believable characters and situations.
One big minus comes from what plagues most new films. There are no quit moments. There can only be maximum 2 minutes of of space between action scenes and even then they must be filled with people constantly talking or at the very least they must have loud music.
Everyone succeeded in their roles quite good but I still don't like Emilia Clarkes ""acting"" She sure looks good and has nice smile but that's all. There is no charisma of any kind. Luckily she didn't have that major a role. Another bit annoying character was the new droid (L3?). It wasn't funny and the yammering about rights to droids got old quickly. Film was more enjoyable when I forgot these new people are supposed to be Han Solo and Lando and would certainly have benefited more if they were totally new characters.Overall it was decent sci-fi film but lacked excitement which resulted from me knowing the characters are not in any kind of danger because it's a prequel.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

Let's start with the awful lead, Alden Ehrenreich, who never once felt like he channeled the character of Han Solo. I never once felt like I was watching a Han Solo film. It felt like random characters in a movie with Chewbacca. I have more respect for Ewan McGregor now. In his performance, I felt like I was watching a young Obi-Wan, despite the fact that he looked nothing like Alec Guinness.The plot/story is so by the numbers that I think the Star Wars franchise is in big trouble in the hands of Disney. Characters are unrecognizable and stories so generic that it really needs a visionary at the helm. This was a heist film and when you compare it to the best heist films, such as The Sting or even Oceans 11, the writing is lazy and boring and you can see the ""twists"" coming from a mile away. This is the third crappy movie they've released after The Force Awakens and The Last Jedi with the only decent movie being Rogue One. Kathleen Kennedy needs to go.The last thing I'll mention is the politically correct droid in the film. One of the most annoying droids of all time. If you're going to preach political themes in films (which I have no problem with), try to be less heavy handed about them.

998,drskytower-13161,The robot SUCKED,1,19 January 2020,"I liked Rogue One, it was better than the horrid trilogy of Star Wars flicks Disney has been busily shunting down the production line. I made the mistake of expecting similar output for this SW spin off, but waited for it to come out on Netflix first. I am glad I got to watch it free of charge. It wasn't worth paying money to see this at a theatre.That actor playing Han Solo is no Harrison Ford. He was more like the actor from Valerian, a pasty-skinned, skinny, doe-eyed wanna-be, the only thing going for him his youthful pretty-boy looks. A Mouseketeer trying his hardest to channel into Harrison Ford. His GF was the same, another Mouseketeer trying hard to act like Carrie Fisher's young stand-in, but the only thing going for her was her pretty Princess looks.The robot was annoying and irritating. It has got to be the worst sidekick I have ever seen in a Star Wars movie. It had the worst personality, the worst dialogue, it was worse than Jar Jar Binks and not many Star Wars sidekicks get any worse than THAT. It looked stupid, mismatching eyes in an asymmetrical face that you can't focus on, which would've been okay if it didn't have soooo much cringe-inducing lines of ""dialogue"". Lando Calrissian's relationship with the robot didn't make sense either... sort of close and creepy and intimate. YUUUUK. What on Earth was Disney thinking????Stuff happens in this flick, but it's boring and forgettable. There's a train robbery scene that reminded me of Disney's The Lone Ranger (the one with Johnny Depp in it), a giant space kraken, a double-crossing villain passing off as Mentor (yawn), and an air car chase scene through a city (triple yawn).

Real fans do not acknowledge the presence of the prequels, they were that bad, and proved that George had really lost his way ( warning signs were in ROTJ ).
We asked for more Star Wars. We got it with Force Awakens, A New Hope clone. The last jedi is continuing the story, and the final instalment will conclude it. The spinoffs are enjoyable enough. Rogue one was an unexpected surprise. Solo is a little above average, certainly not 1/10. 
Wake up people. All those years of asking for more Star Wars, and now every offering becomes an anti-corporate protest. 
Some people have notoriously short term memories.
Anyhoo, to redress the balance, it's a 10 from me.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

It is an exciting subject even though you have watched the horo's death and now come to see how he developed they way he is portrayed in the original Star Wars series. Saying this, I have to say that this particular film did not have major exciting points despite the several action scenes and the high quality of film making and special effects. Compared to Rogue One (that was actually a formidable and exciting film), Solo is just another adventure that is elevated by its heritage and not its actual value. I am sure Disney wants to milk the Star Wars franchise as much as possible but we have come to a point where level of interest has to stay high and this does not mean quantity has to continue at current rates. The movies that supplement the episodes are a great idea (made true by Rogue One), if they are to help however they must stay as interesting as Rogue One. Solo is not a bad movie, it is just that it is not interesting enough and someone that has not watched other Star Wars films would never bother to give it a second thought.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

Forgive me for getting actual names wrong but the guy that played Solo was very good. Landon's character, well if one closed his eyes you'd swear it was Billy D Williams. I spare you all by fumbling other actors names and just say that the cast was very good. The character development, often a weakness in a Star Wars movie, was there in spades.

I'm not much of a fan of the monopoly either but Solo is a really decent film and I don't like to use the word spin-off but rather a parallel to the original 9. Solo reveals a lot of missing information about our heroes and bolsters understanding of the episodes that come after it.

1007,jonahhenry-89032,"Much better than I expected, but not perfect",7,18 March 2019,"I went into the theater expecting another flop from Disney Star Wars (Another ""The Last Jedi"" level atrocity), but what I found instead was an honestly worthy addition to the new canon.
The film actually feels like Star Wars; it actually uses material from the larger canon (including some embellishments on Legends Lore); but most importantly, it is an enjoyable movie with a plot that actually works to some extent.A few points felt odd, but there wasn't a single time where I wasn't enjoying myself at least a little bit.
Ehrenrich is fairly believable as Han (not quite Harrison Ford, but you don't really think about the casting choices during the movie) although his personality isn't really the same as in the OT. This Han is less 'roguish' and more 'kind' than the slightly older version we meet in 'A New Hope. He's also more openly arrogant, but Han is played close enough to Ford's performance that it's believable that he's the same person at a different stage in life.Honestly, I didn't particularly like Donald Glover as Lando. However this is no fault of Glover, I just don't like it when the actor is more well known than the role. Glover is too famous to play a character that had only been onscreen for half an hour before this point.
That being said, he played the role well enough that I occasionally found myself forgetting that it was ""Donald Glover playing a role"" and started just seeing Lando.Some pieces of dialogue are kinda forced and some characters seem to do certain things SPECIFICALLY to pander to the audience, but it doesn't detract too much from the movie.
Also, the ending is just a tad drawn-out.Overall, I would say that this is easily the best film that Disney Star Wars has ever put out (although it still falls shy of most of the pre-2015 content), and it certainly gives me some amount of hope for Episode IX and whatever follows.TL;DR- The movie is good, but not great. It FAR outshines the abysmal failure that is Episode VIII, but it could have been a little tighter and smoother. I was invested all the way through a Star Wars movie for the first time in ten years. It won't disappoint.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

Another IMDb member, poopville' review on the 6th August 2018 struck a cord with me. As a man born in the 70's, I totally agree with what they wrote.

1009,sspina,"Authentically ""Star Wars""",7,28 May 2018,"I thought that this film was a great addition to the franchise. It had enough references to the original films to be filled with nostalgia for those of us who grew up with Star Wars and I thought that went a long way in explaining why Han Solo is the way he is. It had humour, emotional moments, adventure and suspense. I thought that the cast was superb. Alden Ehrenreich and Donald Glover both had big shoes to fill but it was clear to me that they'd put a lot of working into studying the performances of their characters in the original trilogy. You could see this in the way they moved, their mannerisms, even the inflections of their voices at times. The film did well to avoid some cliches that would have made it extremely predictable and still felt authentic to the tone of the original films (my main criticism of The Last Jedi was that it lost this tone completely).At its core, Star Wars is all about the unlikely hero breaking the rules a little to save the day and this film definitely fulfilled that. Overall I think that it was probably my favourite of this ""third wave"" of Star Wars films so far.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

It's why I love stories and movies, and why I've spent so much of my life thinking about how they're made and how they work.""Solo"", I'm pleased to say, satisfied both the youthful fan and the discerning critic inside of me. The former was constantly entertained, watching my long-beloved universe expand in new and organic ways; the latter was pleased and satisfied by the film's brisk pace, interesting characters, clear storytelling, and engaging performances. In other words: ""Solo"" lives up to its roots as a pulp space opera romp, and it does it with charm, inspiration, and skill. I approve.""Solo"" has what it takes to be a good ""Star Wars"" tale: it's got humor and stakes, it has thrilling action and surprising reveals, moments of betrayal and of unexpected displays of loyalty. It has blaster fights and speeder chases (""Star Wars"" has always been as much about hot rods as it has been about Joseph Campbell and samurai flicks). It has wacky aliens and bizarre headgear, despicable bad guys, funny sidekicks, and a charming rogue. About that last part. Look, the new kid isn't Harrison Ford -- only Harrison Ford is. But Alden Ehrenreich shows up and gives his best Han Solo, and it's good -- it's good enough that I'm buying it, and I had fun watching him do it. (Not try it -- do it.) And this is to say nothing of the rest of the cast -- Donald Glover's Lando is delightfully arrogant and smarmy, Emilia Clarke's Qi'ra is believably conflicted and struggling with her loyalties. Paul Bettany sells creepy like he's on commission, and Woody Harrelson...yeah, that's how you play a scuzzy conman. He's a long way from ""Cheers"", tell ya that.Look, make your own call. All I can tell you is this: I've been a fan for forty-one years, through thick and thin (remember when you got made fun of for liking ""Star Wars""? I sure do), and I was perfectly pleased and entertained watching this movie. Not to go all ""No True Scotsman"" on you, but the disparaging remarks coming from other self-professed fans makes absolutely no sense to me. Whatever, that's their problem.

Woody Harrelson turns in a good performance, and I was genuinely thrilled / relieved when Lando's annoying, stupid, loud-mouthed droid got killed. This and Last Jedi proves that Star Wars is a dead franchise.

1020,viithtrump,Closer to Star Wars then the rest...,7,26 May 2018,"This was a enjoyable film by Ron Howard. Thought it was played out well, like the fact that Darth Maul is back in action, I think they have multiple plots to come up with now, with Maul being in play. I thought the acting was as perfect as one could get to playing Han's younger role, and the same for Lando too. The only scene that maybe they could have redone would be how he met Chewy, but it works. I think there is some alternate routes that could have been done involving how he became a extreme pilot other then just flying cars. They had the right idea by putting him in the empire pilot, but then becoming a infantry man? I am not so sure. But they still made it work. Perhaps there could have been another way to entice Lando in a game to put out his Ship, at seems that this all happened so fast like. Maybe he could have won it from him by a bet being placed instead? I always thought that he may have won it from a card game, but a bet could have worked maybe better here. The droid was annoying, equal rights also, but for the most part at least they got rid of it quickly so that it didn't end up as Jar Jar. What can you say its a side story made up as they go.

It was a fun, summertime adventure movie in the same spirit of Rogue One (i.e., sci-fi movie that happens to be in the Star Wars genre but with its own unique plot).

With Solo, it was different. The cinematography was like a blade runner movie rather than a Star Wars.
What was deceiving in that movie was the story in general, we learn nothing from the characters and the journey is almost inexistent. The ending with Qira created a big hole in the whole story.
In rogue one the robot has a very nice sens of humor which made the movie more fun to watch, they tried to copy the same idea with Solo but it just didn't work and the robot was actually quite annoying.This was the weakest movie from all Star Wars movies out there and hopefully they won't be a sequel.

However, the fact that this movie is about Han Solo before the original trilogy doesn't do this movie any favors.This movie exists to explain every little unnecessary detail about Han's past we never needed to see: how he got his name (which the most eye rolling scene I've ever witnessed), how he met Chewbacca, how he met Lando, the kessel run, how he got the millennium falcon. I didn't need to see any of this, much less it all happen in one movie.If this were about a character we hadn't seen before, this would be a pretty fun space heist movie. But every time it references something from the trilogy, or gives a little wink to the audience, the movie stops being fun and just becomes irritating.However the movie looks amazing! Bradford Young did an incredible job. All the actors are great for what they were given. Alden Ehrenreich was a good young Han, but he's not Harrison Ford. And as much I would like to disassociate the actor from the character, it was in the back of my mind the entire time. Donald Glover is always charming and was great as Lando.

While it has some flaws like most movies, not sure why the ratings are so low. The first half of the movie was better than the second half in terms of action.

When Han finds out Chewbacca's name and announces that he's not going to be saying that whole thing every time. Chewbacca has three syllables. It isn't exactly a tongue twisting nightmare. Did this really have to be said? Typical of the writing of this film. Spell it out, all of it. Leave no mystery as to every aspect of the Han Solo we already know. And everything follows this same pattern. Here's how he met Chewbacca. Here's how he got his name. Here's how he met Lando. Here's where he got his blaster. Here's how he got the Falcon. Here's why the Falcon has a superior navigation system. Here's the Kessel run. This is not a movie. It's a Wikipedia page, and the plot is pretty much a vehicle to get us to all these points. The books written in the 90s by AC Crispin were way better. Read those. Don't watch this ""movie"".Some side notes:
1- The Corellian YT-1300 makes its first appearance (in universe) in Attack of the Clones, two of them actually. They look exactly like the Falcon we all know. The whole ""escape pod"" thing is BS.Basically, they tried to sneak another ""here's how"" in there by pulling one directly out of their rectum.2- The walls of the Falcon look far too new. I don't buy it. This is only like 10 years before A New Hope. Do Han and Chewbacca team up with Pig Pen at some point?3 - In the press for this Wiki-film they made a special point in bragging that they were the first to feature a ""female"" droid. This is BS on many levels. In the first place what is a ""female droid""? Droids are AI. They are machines. Is your toaster a dude? No. Secondly, the very first droid we hear speak in Episode 1 has a female voice! Did you not watch your own canon before virtue signaling?

And what I really liked is that the story doesn't roll on luck and coincidence to make things work. You know some things were about to happen (Millennium Falcon won by Han, Chewie's intro to the smuggler, ...), but they managed to do so in that why it was still surprisingly entertaining.
Also there are people dying again (cfr. episode IX)!My thumbs up for the actor who played Han Solo on his performance!Started very sceptic about this one but I give it a high rating because it deserves more love than it gets.The conversation between Maul and Qi'ra and her sudden left off out of the story may be odd, but that's because the writers probably planned to do more films with young Solo..I hope this is not the end, because I sensed they had big plans with Han and Qi'ra...",Solo - A Star Wars Story

I am not joking when I say this, the first act especially DRAGS on forever and immediately after the first act is done the movie does a time jump! The pacing is not only too slow, but it is choppy as well! Some critics are calling it fun summer entertainment, HOW???? Deadpool 2 was fun summer entertainment, this isn't! There isn't a single memorable action scene in this trainwreck. The action is lifeless and dull, it brings nothing to the movie! Also, the humor in this movie is horrible and does not land at any point in this movie! This movie confuses references for humor. References alone is not comedy, references are comedy when you use them for a joke. I saw this in a theater in Winnipeg, and seeing this movie, maybe a handful of people chuckled during these references, not laughs, chuckles. How I can describe a lot of this movie is basically that one Captain America meme from the first Avengers movie that says I UNDERSTOOD THAT REFERENCE. The villain is forgettable and boring and you could easily take him out of the movie. Visually this movie is dull, it doesn't come anywhere close to being as visually spectacular as The Force Awakens, Rogue One, and The Last Jedi. There were also moments where they were trying to be emotional but then they immediately cut to something else, trying to completely ignore a moment that would make us care about what is going on. I wanted to love this movie, as it is a Star Wars movie, I thought we were past making Star Wars movies of the quality of the prequel trilogy. But I guess I was wrong. Instead of seeing Solo: A Star Wars Story, go and see Deadpool 2 again, or watch The Force Awakens, Rogue One, and The Last Jedi, and the original Star Wars trilogy, 6 highly enjoyable Star Wars movies! Solo: A Star Wars Story was garbage",Solo - A Star Wars Story
1039,SMcFirefly,A decent Star Wars flick!,7,6 October 2018,"After the disaster that was The Last Jedi, and only really liking the Vader scenes in Rogue One, I went into this movie with extremely low expectations. I surprisingly enjoyed it while there were parts of the movie that had me shaking my head. L337 is one of the most obnoxious characters ever. This character is written with social justice politics in mind. Almost all of her lines were irritating, and it just felt like it was thrown in. Adding to that, the ""Pando"" Lando was also unnecessary, and completely unlike the Lando we were introduced to in Empire. However, Donald Glover plays him very well; echoing a young Billy Dee Williams from his line delivery to his mannerisms. Alden was not bad, but not amazing. I would have preferred Anthony Ingruber. Alden at points resembled Han Solo, but it wasn't consistent enough for me. The origin of his name is also ridiculous.
His chemistry with Chewbacca is in my opinion the strongest part of the movie. The score was good and hearing John Williams' old themes really got the blood pumping!I love Star Wars. The original trilogy will always be among my favourite of all time. The prequels also hold a special place in my heart. Despite the problems I have with this movie, it has been my favourite Disney Star Wars film thus far. I feel like it would have done much better at the box office if it weren't for The Last Jedi leaving a poor taste in many people's mouths.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

1041,chintok91,I loved it.,8,12 September 2018,I liked the movie it was decent adventure movie. Has quite charm in it. A hero in the journey to be made. Only problem I had was movie has opened a lot of questions and didn't answer to them. Maybe sequel. Who knows. And if you reading my review and thinking if the movie was decent why there are so many people whos are hate it. Lets face it there are tons of tons of fans of star wars and have their own imaginations of the Han Solo's life. But the movie didn't had it. Because it's not their imagination.,Solo - A Star Wars Story
1042,darcontek,Better than expected,7,30 May 2018,Solo is a good movie. Not the best. But the reason why this movie did terrible in the box office is because of how fans felt after seeing The Last Jedi and the terrible treatment of fans by Lucasfilm.Watch it and you'll have a great time. I came in with low expectations and was pleasantly surprised.,Solo - A Star Wars Story
1043,trevtokos,Solid but don't expect much,6,27 May 2018,I enjoyed it but not enough that I would watch it again. This movie shows the background of Han Solos life and that's what I came for.

Frankly any star wars fan would be undoubtedly be looking forward to such a prequel. Unfortunately it doesnt meet even our meekest of expectations. 
Very well directed, but the script lets down a well put together cast. 
Danny glover could have been perfect as lando.
Chewy was great. 
 It just misses the mark....and it looks like there will be 2 more movies... I wasnt even expecting that. 
Scripts better be looked at and some study on the 'timeframe'.

After a few poor reviews I really wasn't expecting much, so it came as a pleasant surprise, and by the end I was actually seeing the lad Alden as being Han Solo, he did well. I rate it worse than Rouge One but better than the both the main storyline films",Solo - A Star Wars Story
1047,margotwiseman,Fly Casual,7,11 June 2018,"I will admit I haven't ever been the biggest Star Wars fan, and I know I'll get a lot of flak for saying this, but the newest Star Wars films have been my favorite of the franchise. Rouge One actually made me think about rewatching the older installments.So with that in mind, this was everything I expected from a Han Solo centric film. I imagine this would be the same kind of film if a young Harrison Ford stared in it.The film isn't over complicated and it is a bit predictable because if you've seen the originals a lot of the information we get in Solo we already know. However for a younger audience who may not have seen the original films this would be exciting and probably less predictable. Over all it's a fun, light-hearted film that sheds some light onto a much loved character.Was it worth seeing in theater? Sure.Would I see it in theaters again? If someone I knew wanted me to go with them sure, otherwise no.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

This movie definitely holds its own.
It has a ""one off"" vibe from the rest of the Star Wars universe but isn't it supposed to?
Alden Ehrenreich is an outstanding young Han Solo.
Emilia Clarke is SO good in this. One might feel she's channeling Lanister blood.
How good is this movie? It deserves a sequel. THAT good. Thankful they didn't make the mistake of Rogue One and kill EVERYBODY.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
1049,tle_mgr,Sorry but I liked it,8,27 May 2018,"I know that the ""in"" thing to do now is to complain in the direction that the franchise is going, and that it is more Kathleen's SJW project than anything else.While there is evidence to support the last part, I won't dwell on it but might come back to say something later.Look, It was a good Solo origin story, that was also brought along the beginnings of how he met Chewy and Lando. All in all it was done very well. Much better than Force Awakens or Last Jedi, but on par with Rogue One. There were great battles, good chases and even an appearance from Maul. Of course I thought he died in Phantom Menace, I have been corrected that the animated TV show Clone Wars found a way to bring him back.Anyway go see if it and put money in Kathleen's pockets and support her agenda, or wait until you can watch it online. If you have kids, then most likely they whined you into paying for it. Like mine did.Now, I don't have a problem with strong women in movies. I think most men really like feme fatales, mostly because they are hot and they can kick ass. But I think there is a line between natural Feme Fatales and SJW types that are forced on us.Putting a woman in a lead role simply because you want a woman to fill it, is unnatural and fans will sense it immediately. In Kathleen's favor, Princess Leia was indeed a firecracker and already knew how to fire laser gun. We can assume, that having been brought up as a Rebel Princess she had no choice. But she didn't know how to fly anything or wield a light sabre.In the last four Star Wars movies, for some reason men had to be either idiots or severely flawed, in order for the women to be seen as strong. Lando's female Robot, was clearly and SJW plot device. Complete with wide hips for ""birthing"" and a sassy attitude, that makes black nurses in movies look docile.We all know Ren was a Mary Sue, who never had any experience flying anything other than the common floating cycle, yet learned to fly starships in less than five minutes and how to fight with a light saber just as short a time.Solo was just as bad. His girl friend, suddenly is a two time slum rat like him, yet the next time they meet she is sophisticated and is able to create several plots of treachery at once, and ended up running one of the most feared galactic mafia families in the Empire. Then we find the leader of a one of most feared bandits in galaxy is actually female. Kathleen just keeps creating them. Heck Star Wars IX could very well be an all Female cast, much like the trend in Hollywood anyway (Ghostbusters, Oceans 11 etc.).So that's my rant.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
1050,sandykemp,Better Than I Expected...,7,27 June 2018,"I went into this movie with pretty low expectations due to the largely negative press I had been hearing about it.However I have to say I did enjoy it! Yes its not exactly groundbreaking...in fact its pretty predictable most of the time but I have to say it is non-stop action pretty much from start to finish. Also there are a lot of nods to the other movies of the franchise which I have to admit did make me smile at times.I can understand why people have slated the film....although I feel Star Wars fans nowadays are becoming somewhat crazy about ripping into the new movie.Yes the story isn't exactly a new one...its pieced together from bits of Legends and background stuff George Lucas spoke about years ago but it's nice to see it all put together and played out for once.The cast do a pretty good job in their roles. Harrelson makes a great merc and Glover is the stand out performance for me as the young Lando. Emilia Clarke does well in the femme fatale role I have to admit but I feel L33T stole almost all of the scenes she was in.There are a few interesting cameos from familiar (or not so familiar) characters which again link to the wider franchise and there is a rather interesting side story surrounding Enfys Nest which hints at bigger things going on in the Galaxy.It's certainly not the best Star Wars film ever made by any means but for me I felt it was a pretty decent action romp that has filled the void until Episode IX for now.I would like to see a continuation of where this movie leaves off but I have a bad feeling that its not very likely to happen! With Rogue One being the only other ""A Star Wars Story"" to compare Solo with I have to say that Disney & Lucasfilm may be better off sticking with it's formula rather than delving into the back stories of legendary characters.I've been a Star Wars fan most of my life. I grew up watching the original trilogy, I think I'm in the minority who actually liked the Prequels. I just feel that Star Wars fans expect too much from the new movies. If things don't go how they feel it should then they start a crusade to destroy the reputations of the people behind them. George Lucas faced their wrath over the Prequels and now because Lucasflm wants to try something new the Triggered Fan Boys are at it again!I just hope that Solo's low performance doesn't derail Star Wars' future simply because some butthurt Fan Boys cause Disney to just can the whole thing.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
1051,kwood-69353,Enjoyable but lacking something,7,27 March 2019,Not a bad action sci fi flick but painfully substandard.,Solo - A Star Wars Story
1052,oceanmaya,Enjoyable ride of an adventure,7,8 October 2018,"If you're a hard-core Star Wars fan, chances are you will prob not like this as it will destroy whatever pre-conceived notion you have about the Han Solo character. Good thing I am not and I saw this movie knowing so little about Han Solo, just that sidekick of Luke who gets to fly them on their mission. It is really difficult to replace Harrison Ford and I thought Alden Ehrenreich will have a hard time emulating the character especially on his effeminate performance in Beautiful Creatures. But they got whoever is available at this time. Those acting lessons may had actually paid off for Alden as he did stay true to the character including Harrison Ford's mannerisms as best as he could. He displayed that kind of arrogance yet goofy attitude prone to mistakes yet can pull things off at crucial moments and that smile even if things are not exactly stellar, like a space-age Indiana Jones (oh, that's Harrison Ford too, pretty much the same character, different roles). Anyway, if you can forgive this and let go of all the bias, then you can enjoy the ride. When I started the movie, I was expecting it to be crap. It started really slow but during the meet with Tobias Beckett, it got really interesting and the movie became Star Wars after that. One of the fun scenes was when he first met Chewbacca - classic! From the heist to the fight scenes, to the flying in space and escaping enemies and doing more outrageous heists, Solo was one good ride of an adventure that I think the writers and directors did a pretty good job here. Because of the movie, I understood better the original Star Wars trilogy and the motivation of the characters involved such as Chewbacca and Lando. The special effects were excellent and the movie portrayed the Star Wars universe very well.
So it doesn't really make sense to me the irrational hate that hard-core fanboys have written in the other reviews. I think these people should get a life. So buckle up people and just enjoy the ride!",Solo - A Star Wars Story
1053,joeschook,Better than I expected,7,16 October 2020,"This isn't the greatest movie. But it's not awful. That being said, I do have a few complaints.
The lighting was kind of too dark. I get they're trying to paint a mood but I was straining to see the screen.
Solo himself did pretty good, although he was a bit too selfless compared to what we were introduced to in A New Hope. Lando was almost spot on, although the whole droid romance thing was a bit ridiculous.
I don't like that these stand alone movies don't seem to even reference the other movies. I understand it, but it should still feel connected to a degree.
Finally, Maul at the end was completely unnecessary fan service.
Overall, it was entertaining enough for me to buy the DVD and definitely better than the crap fest sequel trilogy.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

1059,cpaulcanaday,It's a fun ride,7,27 May 2018,"I did not think I would bother with this movie. I was feeling Star Wars fatigue, and the trailers did not exactly fill me with yearning. Then I started hearing good things about it and decided, ok, let's give it a shot. Admittedly, it did not take much. Despite my protestations and the prequels-that-shall-not-be-named... and Return of the Jedi..., ok, in spite of 60-70% of the Star Wars movies made so far, I am still and have always been a fan.Solo is a fun, roller coaster ride of a movie, plain and simple. A fun, enjoyable action/adventure movie. It is not AWESOME but it sure knows how to show you a good time. Kind of like the Saturday movie matinees that Lucas presumably had in mind when he made the first one.Ever since Joseph Campbell declared Star Wars to be an excellent example of the Hero With A Thousand Faces myth, and George Lucas decided, ""It is? Oh. Well, um, why YES! Yes it is. That is what I had in mind all along!"" Star Wars movies have had the weight of their own perceived significance hanging around their necks. Even the more recent ones that have made a concerted effort to incorporate some levity have not fully been able to escape that weight. This one does. There is no Force or fate of the universe hanging in the balance (not directly, anyway). There is corruption, of course, and oppression that influences the characters and the decisions they make. And while those things are important and motivating, the characters' endeavors to overcome or escape their oppressive pasts are done as part of their own individual journeys rather than as part of some larger, galactic moral battle. The movie's hues are grays, browns and darker, more muted colors but it still feels light and fleet. I did not think I would like Alden Ehrenreich as Han Solo but I did. I thought I was kind of done with Chewbacca but this movie finds something new about the character - more like it reboots him instead of resurrecting him for the umpteen-millionth time. When I heard that Woody Harrelson and Emilia Clark were in it I thought, ""Really? Why?"" but they're both great. Donald Glover as Lando is also great. In fact, I kind of wanted more of him.So, yeah.

All those people who believe they're too smart to have fun or lack the ability to sit back and enjoy a movie without hating it, because it's simply not the movie THEY would make, are becoming the VOICE of all fans. Sorry guys, if you love to hate Star Wars projects, you are not a fan. AND if you hated this movie, you are NOT the voice of the REAL Star Wars fan! My friends and I loved this movie! Born in 1974, I grew up with Star Wars. We all did! This was so loyal to the original spirit of Han and all the other characters we had come to love over the years; not just in the films, but in literature and the amazing animated series' done by Dave Filoni. It created side characters with sub-stories that we became eager to learn more about! It was exciting! It was pure adventure! It was funny! It was everything Star Wars was all about before Rian Johnson made his depressing and aimless Last Jedi film (that I swear was made for the trolls who claim to be fans). I usually don't critique films, but I'm worried that the stupid people who encourage people to not see movies will ruin the chance we have to see another movie that continues where this story left off! This movie is not making money because people are being told to stay home. DON'T STAY HOME! Go out and see this movie! As my friend said when it was over, ""you'll feel like a kid again.""

1063,Piledriver,In many respects the best of the Star Wars franchise movies,9,4 June 2019,"Unfortunately the target of manifold undeserved ill plaudits, Solo is definitely worth a viewing. Yes, the character of Solo is not the Solo we meet in Star Wars: A New Hope. Nor does Alden Ehrenreich even closely resemble Harrison Ford. Fortunately, he is a good actor and plays the character with empathy. The acting throughout is of a pretty decent quality, something not always seen in Star Wars movies, sad to say. Solo has arguably the best script of all the Star Wars movies and quite possibly the best direction. It works as a stand alone movie away from the franchise: indeed, it is probably the best example of a movie that does this since A New Hope. Summing up, this movie is worth checking out even if you do not like Star Wars particularly. For those of us that do this movie would be even better if a sequel were made that followed the evolution of Han Solo further into the loveable rogue we see in A New Hope. The poor reception this movie received may prevent this happening, but I for one really wish for another instalment of the Solo story.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

1066,ildudeentertainment,The Best of Disney Era Star Wars,8,28 July 2019,"After the Disney acquisition of Lucasfilm, I have had a very love-hate relationship with the franchise, ""Force Awakens"" (2015) left me leaving the theater with a deep disappointment whereas I felt ""Rogue One"" (2016) was an amazing movie, then ""The Last Jedi"" rolled around and while I found the movie quite enjoyable with some very high-quality film making, I couldn't help but feel that I didn't agree with the direction the sequel trilogies was taking Star Wars and that Disney just was missing something that made Star Wars, Star Wars. So with growing distrust for Disney's take on a franchise, I once loved, and constant news about complications during its production I went to see ""Solo: A Star Wars"" story with very low expectations. I felt as though Alden Ehrenreich was a horrible choice for Han and could never fill the shoes once worn by Harrison Ford, and was petrified that it would tarnish my favorite character from the entire Saga. Yet upon leaving the theater I realized I couldn't have been more wrong with my worries.
Solo is far from a perfect movie, in fact, I would argue that the first thirty minutes of the movie are sub-par at best. While there are a few interesting action sequences in the opening act, a lot of it feels very hand fisted and too ""wink-wink, nudge-nudge"" for my taste. The movie even goes so far as to tell us how Han got his last name, a question no fan was seeking answers to. There are a few other scenes like this in the opening act, which is a shame because these scene's clearly could have been great had they not made it so obvious that they were happening. Luckily the movie gets better at this as Han joins Beckett's crew and embarks on his first heist. There's a clear shift in the tone of the movie moving forward most likely due to the directional shift to Ron Howard and it's from here on out that Solo became my favorite Star Wars movie to date.
The story laid out by Ron Howard is nothing over the top, and is a fairly small story compared to other Star Wars movies but I have to see it still captures the grandness of what makes Star Wars, Star Wars. The basic plot of the movie is obviously a Han origin story, showcasing him meeting Chewy, Lando, and a few original characters along the way as they attempt to pull off a heist for a sinister criminal empire in exchange for their lives. We get to see the iconic Kestle Run played out on screen, as well as the Lando and Han gambling over the Millennium Falcon, and even a new twist on the ""Han Shot First"" debate. What really allows this movie to stand out is it's cast of both characters and actors, that allow a rather simple plot to be such an enjoyable ride.
Aldrens take on Han starts out rather choppy and as if he's trying a little too hard, but he soon grows comfortable with the character and we get to see a younger even more brash Han with all of the charm of Harrison Ford. Chewies arc in the movie is quite remarkable as well, as the story takes him from ferocious beast trapped in a hole to a ferocious beast trapped in one dangerous situation after the other. Donald Glover might be one of the highlights of this movie for me, going in I knew he was the perfect choice for Lando but I could have never guessed just how perfect he is. Glover manages to capture all of the suave of Billy Dee Williams and ups it by ten, and the banter between him and Aldren's Han is perfectly done as the two try to one-up each other in every conversation. Then comes the new additions to the Star Wars cast with Beckett's Crew and Qi'ra. Woody Harrelson does an outstanding job as Beckett, allowing us to see many of the traits Ford's Han would one day possess without looking like a carbon copy. Meanwhile, the rest of his crew is more or less forgettable, Beckett's wife plays a minor part in the movie but is given no real character and you just don't really care about her, same goes for Beckett's former pilot voiced by Jon Favreau who is slightly more likable but you aren't exactly crying for more of his character. Emilia Clarke's Qi'ra is a very interesting character, and once again proves that Star Wars does female characters better than most other franchises (well, for the most part). Qi'ra is initially shown as reliant on Han, but as the movie progresses she is constantly shown to be strong, independent, and usually one step ahead of everyone else without ever needing to point out that she's a woman. Instead, she's just portrayed as an interesting character with a lot more story to tell.
What I think makes Solo such a great film, is the fact that it shows that Star Wars doesn't need giant stories where the fate of the universe is at stake or even Jedi. The Star Wars universe is so big and interesting, and Solo is really the first time we see such a different corner of it, despite the fact that it's about such a huge character from the original saga. Solo is not just an underrated Star Wars movie, but just an underrated movie in general and probably the best thing to come out of Disney era Star Wars. After leaving the movie, I was reminded why I loved this franchise so much and couldn't wait to get home and whip out all of my Star Wars games, as this movie reignited the same joy I had as a kid leaving the theatre of ""Attack of the Clones"" (2002) or ""Revenge of the Sith"" (2005) with my dad. Definitely give this movie a shot if you haven't seen it yet because despite its flaws it's such a fun, and what it does right is so much better than anything it does wrong. Would definitely give this movie a 8/10, as it clearly had the force with it.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
1067,passuear,Decent movie with a terrible cameo,4,28 May 2018,"The movie itself was good. Not really good enough to watch twice. If I had to rate it among all the Star Wars movies, this would be last. It didn't have all that much of a plot with a super anti-climactic ending. When the movie was ending, I looked at my watch thinking is this really over? It hasn't really done anything yet. It had some fun moments with minimal fighting, but it rarely felt like it achieved anything. It did not feel like a Star Wars movie. It felt like the episode in the middle of a 25 episode TV season that was a bridge between the episodes you wanted to watch. Overall, I'd give it a 6.That brings me to why my rating is a 4 star. So at the end, Darth Maul appears to my confusion. I'm thinking wasn't this supposed to be post-episode 3? The timeline didn't seem to add up. Then I go online to find out Maul survived being cut in half. I'll say that again. HE SURVIVED BEING CUT IN HALF. What is going on in this world where someone says we should include this in the movie when writing the script and after at least 30 minutes of laughing they don't say that's ridiculous? It is absurd. Then you go online and all the Star Wars fanboys are in love with this. They say, ""Oh you just need to watch all the cartoons to understand it."" No. No I don't. There's the ridiculousness that is done in the comics and cartoons that belong in the comics and cartoons. The adults that watch the movies have these things called brains. We like to see things that are some sort of believable. Forget the fact there's a force and other magical stuff. First it was Leia living through being in outer space for an extended time.

With all the previous Star Wars movies, my first look was after 90 minutes or more and then when the movie is over, wanting more.
With Solo, it took 5 minutes and I would look every 5 to 10 minutes and wonder when this was going to end. After the movie ended, I had no desire to want more.
Maybe is I had looked at this as a B Sci Fi, not directed by Ron Howard, not part of the Star Wars franchise and not owned by Disney, I might have enjoyed it more, I.A.W. I set my expectations to match the other Star Wars movies. My bad.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

Solo adds more to Han, Chewbacca, and Lando, and their general good-guy trying to look like a bad guy personas.
I'm no Star Wars expert or fanatic - I just like it.
I enjoy the humor and camaraderie. There is an epic action scene when they are trying to capture a train car going through the mountains.

Many reviewers complained about the ""slow"" pace of the 1st half of the movie. I found it to be engaging, and while not quite as ""fast"" as the 2nd half, it was still not at all slow. I guess what I consider slow will be glacial to whoever complained about the pace of this movie. I liked all the main characters, and thought that it creates a

1077,douglasbrook-1,"Excellent, flawless and entertaining with perfect Star Wars ""tone"".",8,12 June 2018,"Alden Ehenreich shone in 'Hail Ceaser"" as a rising star with the X factor and unsurpassed Charisma - so it was a thrill to know he had been cast as Han Solo. Upon seeing ""Solo"" expectations were not disappointed - he morphs into the character and in your mind he seamlessly merges with Harrison Fords rendition - making it a piece of casting perfection. He radiates the essential Han Solo characteristics and his beauty and charisma are captivating. The excellent genre script inventively covers the story points we expected - such as meeting Chewbacca. The script supplies plenty of unexpected twists to elevate the film above a mere origin story and make it work as a great film in its own right. The entire cast and direction are perfect. Of course Ron Howard is a master at what he does so no surprise that he puts the entire film together flawlessly. One can wistfully hope that Disney may dispense with the reckless, egotistical, cerebral, misguided directors like Rian J. and just admit that Howard knows Star Wars and let him direct all future films. Perhaps the most flawless Star Wars film since A New Hope. While The Empire Strikes Back is, IMO, the best - the ""Empire"" story structure has some flaw. While Rogue One is the 3rd best, IMO, the script has some uneven and illogical sections - while the script for Solo feels as if it has been perfectly edited and as if it flowed out with no lumps or bumps. There are adventures, action, comedy, emotion and intelligence - all exactly in the tone of Star Wars. The only disapointment is the way the critics and fans have decided to make this film the sacrificial lamb to atone for the misguided sins of TFA and TLJ. We should be celebrating that the film makers finally got the formula so right after the unmentionable prequels and the misjudged sequels. I myself could happily watch another 10 adventures of Han, Chewie and Lando. It shows that the sequel trilogy - with it's attempts to follow the originals is waning while there is untapped potential in films like Rogue One and Solo.

The plot is ridiculously poor without any substance. Han is a faint echo of the Han we know in first three movies.

1088,mfletch79,SOLO: The movie that NOBODY wanted!!,5,25 May 2018,"The force is weak with this one. Disney's influence on the Star Wars universe is now complete. After the 2 hour toy advert that was TLJ now comes a weak, half arsed, predictable, boring and unoriginal Han Solo movie, somebody should tell Disney that sometimes less is more!!
Apart from Donald Glover & Pheobe Waller-Bridge there isn't a lot to get excited about here, even the excellent Woody Harrelson struggles to drag this movie out of the Sarlac pitt of dullness.
Basically SOLO is nothing more than a ""heist gone wrong"" movie with Star Wars characters shoe horned in, there isn't anything here we haven't seen before but LOTS that we have!! Even one of Han's early escape stunts is copied from the 1971 Bond movie ""Diamonds are Forever"" but done with CGI. Everything felt forced (no pun intended) with SOLO, which is a shame as the excitement of seeing old characters and spaceships should of been enough to make this worth watching. Even the brief cameo of a certain red/black Sith Lord felt like an afterthought!!
Judging by the lack of people in the screening I went too this isn't going to be a huge hit. Hopefully these weak spin offs will now go away now.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
1089,toophat82,Disney clearly dosen't care about fans or Star Wars!,5,7 June 2018,"As long as Disney continues to inject politics whether it's political correctness or catering to sjws I'm done with star wars. Considering Rogue one was a standalone and has been the only good star wars film since disney took over i thought there's a chance another standalone like Solo has chance to deliver that true star wars experience us star fans know and love and while at times Solo was good once again what good it did do was destroyed by politics. Between the stupid sjw droid that had you cringing every time it said or did anything, what they did with Lando who btw has never been pan sexual but just a smooth talking scoundrel, and making Han Solo appear to be helpless and instead of being the smooth and gunslinging smuggler that he was who loved to help and rescue the damsel he is instead he appeared to be a fake and helpless smuggler and instead the one needed to be rescued by everyone including the damsels he goes after apparently. So between the stupid sjw robot that made no sense, how they tried to portray lando in and outside the movie, and how they portrayed Han Solo and particularly in the end too ruined all that was good about film. While it was alot better then Both TFA and TLJ in the end once again the issues like blatantly and obviously injecting politics whether it's political correctness or catering to sjws is what ruins these movies in the end and is ruining the legacy of so many beloved characters and star wars period. Luckily i got to watch the movie for free thanks to free tickets because while it was surely better the both episodes TFA and TLJ and standalones like Rogue One and Solo surely have been better then the episodes I promised myself after the disaster that wad the last jedi as long as Disney and Lucasfilm continues to be politically correct and caters to sjws I won't spend another dollar on anything new relating to star wars period. Star wars originally had amazing stories and characters all while not being commercialized, remaining apolitical, and being diverse but diversity done right.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
1090,stamenkovickosta,That surely was... something,5,27 July 2018,"When this movie came out, at first i didn't want to see it. I'm not a fan of the fact that Disney is trying to milk Star Wars as much as possible with pointless spin-offs. Especially the one that is about one of my childhood heroes, Han Solo. Since then, i constantly kept seeing two kinds of reviews: ones that said it sucked so badly and ruined everything, and those that said that it's harmless adventure film. So, i finally saw it. Did i regret?Yes. And no.Let's start with negatives. Plot. What plot? Characters are just moving from place A to place B and not much interesting things happen to them. Movie actually has interesting start with Han being Imperial soldier. His introduction to Chewie and Beckett's crew is a bit sloppy, but it's tolerable. Crew than raids the Imperial train, and I'm not gonna lie, that part was a lot of fun. Even though we know that Solo and Chewie aren't gonna die, it still kept me invested. And as far as I am concerned, that part should have been the movie's climax. Unfortunately, it wasn't.Instead of following the story of these five smugglers, we lose two of them in previously mentioned scene and soon after that we are introduced to whole bunch of new ones. There's Solo's girlfriend (who also appears at the film's very beginning), who is completely wooden, bland and uninteresting. We also meet her boss, who is your typical obvious villain who they try to pretend that he is not obvious villain, but then they keep giving us ""subtle"" clues that he actually is our villain. It's so poorly done and that's a bit shocking given that this movie is directed by veteran Ron Howard, who should be above this kind off cliches.But it only get's worse. Than we meet Lando and his sex-buddy, feminist, droid rights fighter droid - L3. This character is, by far, the worst and most annoying Star Wars character ever. She's worse than Jar Jar, Trade Federation guys and Rose, even worse than Holdo. Character is obviously another example of Kathleen Kennedy pushing her feminist agenda, without even getting that done right. It's not even subtle. Best part of the movie is that stupid trash can getting blasted. But it's immediately followed by the worst one: our heroes inject her navigational system into Falcon, meaning that the reason why Falcon is the greatest ship in galaxy is... because of this trash can.After that part, i lost my interest in the rest of the movie. And that was good, because final act is so messy and sloppy. Suddenly, Beckett is also villain and there is some boring action at the end in which Han shoots Beckett, while his girlfriend kills ""obviously not a villain"" villain. And then it just ends. That's it.This was the first Star Wars movie where i felt absolutely NOTHING. I didn't care about any of the characters. Even though most of the actors (even usually dull Emilia Clarke) do a good job, they aren't given much to do, nor are their characters given much development. It's a shame, because good actors like Woody Harrelson and Paul Bettany are completely wasted. I'll say it again: why wasn't this movie about initial five members of the crew? If movie sticked to them, than maybe reveal of Beckett as villain would be shocking. This way, it wasn't. They should have cut Han's girlfriend, Mr. Obvious Villain and that dumb Fembot. First two brought nothing to the movie, and the third one just completely destroyed it.But, as i said, there are things to like. Alden is good as Han, action and locations are amazing and I did enjoy seeing infamous Kessel run. Add Darth Maul cameo to that, and you have a fine film. Unfortunately, it's cons brought it down, and now it's, in my opinion, worst live action Star Wars movie. It's really a shame, given that many talented people were involved in this, so kudos to them - they are not the ones to blame.It's Disney to blame. They need to realize that Star Wars is something much more than just another movie franchise they can milk infinitely. Even though Rogue One was better than i thought, it was still completely pointless, just like this movie. I wish Disney would abort this side projects and focus on finishing their trilogy. If they want to keep making Star Wars movies after that, that's fine. But, please, respect this franchise, stop pushing your political agenda and think about real audience for once (and those are not critics and civil rights activists).",Solo - A Star Wars Story
1091,Naurya,Solid adventure movie that captures the spirit of Star Wars,7,21 May 2018,"After the huge disappointment that was ""The Last Jedi"", I'm really glad to say that ""Solo"" is once again a Star Wars movie that captures the spirit of Star Wars! It doesn't try to ""kill the past"", but shows a decent amount of respect for its original characters.Alden Ehrenreich does a good job as Han Solo, though - of course - he is no Harrison Ford. But it doesn't take long until you accept him as a younger Han Solo. Donald Glover, however, is brilliant as Lando Calrissian and truly embodies the smooth playboy with his extravagant clothing style. I loved every second he was on screen. Woody Harrelson was also great as Han's mentor - a role very similar to the one he played in ""The Hunger Games"". The only cast member who wasn't able to convince entirely was Emilia Clarke as Qi'ra, though I don't know if it's her fault or the script's fault. Too much about her character was left in the dark and even in the end I never understood her goals or motivations.The movie is an action-packed adventure and it never gets boring. However, sometimes the action gets in the way of the character development. As an audience, we have too little time to get to know the new characters in the beginning, which makes it difficult to sympathize with them during action scenes.The established characters, on the other hand, are all beautifully portrayed and there are some great Star Wars moments in this movie that fans have imagined since back in 1977. Some might call it fan service, but these scenes are never over the top or in-your-face, but well woven into the story.The humor is also dead-on! I laughed a lot during the screening and I can't remember a single joke that didn't work. Most importantly, there is no self-referential humor and people also don't act out of character just for the sake of a joke (as was the case in ""The Last Jedi""). I especially enjoyed the numerous instances where Han tries to talk himself out of dire situations by making ludicrous claims or excuses. Typically Han!Though ""Solo"" surely isn't a revelation and can't make up for the mess that is the sequel trilogy, the movie has given me hope again that Lucasfilm might be heading into the right direction in the future. The atmosphere in ""Solo"" just felt right, as did the characters. The ""Star Wars feeling"" has returned!",Solo - A Star Wars Story
1092,rsjury,Worst one yet!,1,30 September 2018,I am surprised anyone would give this more than one star. People are getting so used to mediocre writing and directing (What happenned Ron?). Sadly I am done with this train wreck.,Solo - A Star Wars Story
1093,awinters220,Solid fun!,7,20 January 2019,"Enjoy Star Wars? Enjoy popcorn movies? You should like Solo. I'm a serious Star Wars fan and to me the spin-offs don't effect the trilogies. We meet young Han, see his first smuggling job, learn the tricks of the trade, meet his mentor, his first love, see some old favorites, see some easter eggs. It's a good time!
The fellow who plays Han does a great job. He had huge shoes to fill! Nobody is ever going to be Harrison Ford's Han Solo but this guy is very likable and does the character justice. The stand out star of the movie is Donald Glover's Lando! He's got the voice and the swagger down (though I could have done without the pansexual tendencies. Jonathan Kasdam is an asshat. You want a character that screws toasters? Write a new character, don't mess with beloved classics. )

1094,catchmadhav16,Delayed hyperspace,7,20 June 2018,"Through the years, the telling the story of a galaxy far, far away has struck people with wonder, hope, enjoyment, and love for the franchise. Each subsequent episode adding something innovative and daring to its belt which ranged from blasters to death stars. This Star Wars story is neither innovative nor daring, and probably for its best. We have no deep revelations regarding the Force, there is no Death Star or secret facility to extract codes, there are no lightsaber fights, and most importantly, not even a mention of the Empire, First Order or the Resistance. For once, it felt like it did not have to use posterior elements to rehash and yet, be set completely and fit magnanimously in the Star Wars universe. The story takes off with Han (Alden Ehrenreich) escaping his enslaved slum planet, Corellia. Alas, he is forced to leave his girlfriend Qi'ra(Emilia Clarke) behind and vows to come back for her. He joins the Empire military in the hope to become a pilot for their cavalry but ends up being reassigned to the infantry. He eventually crosses paths with Beckett(Woody Harrelson), a thief of dubious ambitions in a fix with Dryden Vos(Paul Bettany), a well-dressed, scar-faced galaxy warlord.  What unfolds from this point is a heist film. A fun heist supported with elevating characters, voiced by Jon Favreu and adding further charm by Thandie Newton. However, as much as the stakes are pushed forward, we are left with less of a suspense towards its conclusion. This fatigue can be termed as prequel fatigue, mainly because the future of Han Solo has already been unfolded to us numerous times in the upcoming episodes. For a heist movie, there is a head guy who makes the legs of our protagonist jelly, just like Oceans Eleven, we had Andy Garcia, a not-to-be-messed-with personality on screen. There was a lack of such a personality on-screen making the heist seem strenuously predictable and have a tremendous lack of suspense overall. The performances are memorable, a well-cast feature which probably was enough for a movie of such ambitions. Alden as impeccable as he was in ""Hail, Caesar!"" knew well to not imitate Harrison Ford on screen and went on to sketch his own version of Han Solo. A proud moment for him, proving wrong a considerable amount of people based on his appearances in the trailers, Alden proved himself more than capable of convincing us he is Han. Emilia Clarke proved she can shine out of the show of Game of Thrones as well, that too without playing the generic damsel-in-distress role. Woody Harrelson was well inside his comfort zone and still managed to pull off a memorable performance. Donald Glover comes out the most charismatic of all as Lando Carlissian, with his casino tricks and charming smile and is perhaps the standout of this movie. Solo is filled with fan catering moments which prove to be flirty winks to most of its fans across the world. Starting with Han and Chewbacca's accidental meet to Han and Lando maneuvering the Millenium Falcon at 12 parsecs. Nevertheless, Solo ends up feeling more of a cash grab milking the cash cow desperately dry. The small scale of the film surprises as a Star Wars film and yet after everything, it manages to draw a hesitant smile on us. Ultimately, it's the colorful story that Han Solo deservingly brags about with a twinkle in his eye. It is after all, for the fans, numbered in millions around the world.For more reviews visit elcritiquecom.wordpress.com",Solo - A Star Wars Story

I don't like any concepts that waiver from the original franchise world. Solo is different. I thoroughly enjoyed it and left the cinema pumped - as did the crew of Star Wars nerd buddies I went with.

1097,hisimperialmatt,Its fine,5,27 May 2018,"It is enjoyable as just a simple action movie. There are interesting parts of the movie, but most make less sense the more you think about them. All the iconic Han Solo moments felt like they were just on a checklist of stuff they had to show to make the movie.
The actors do a fine job, including Alden as Han Solo. A lot of the other characters felt underutilized and bland, especially Beckett. I did not get the sense of the 'pupil-mentor' relationship that was implied, it was just some dude Han Solo met that told him a few things. 
Although Han is the main character, this felt more like of a movie with Han Solo in it rather than a movie about him (The title is ""Solo: A Star Wars Story"", not ""A Star Wars Story: feat. Han Solo""). That being said, there is really nothing inherently wrong with it other than some cheesy dialogue and missed opportunities.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

1099,jasperkwint,Generic sci-fi movie,1,24 May 2018,"The movie was bland and sometimes even boring. Nothing really interesting happens and nothing of interest is explored. I sometimes even forgot that I was watching a Star Wars movie. Alden Eihrenreich plays a fun and cool character, just nothing like Harrison Ford's Solo. Which is the least of the problems of this movie. Lando is a disappointment, he is hardly in the movie. The droid is annoying. Calling for 'equal rights' for droids. Like really? It was just distracting. 
Since when are droids self-conscious? Since when do they care that they do work for aliens and humans? The plot is bland and generic. Its just a sequence of events. It has no real focus or heart. No soul. It does nothing to deepen or explore the Star Wars lore or mythology.
Lando's pan-sexuality shows a few times, but nothing extreme. There is a moment where the droid makes a comment about Lando being in love with her, which is really weird and awkward, but thats about it. The SJW stuff is not really noticeable (except from the droid, but its not that bad, just a bit annoying). So people boycotting this for the SJW aspect can stop it and relax. Just boycott it because its a disappointing movie and Star Wars deserves better.The hamfisted cameo from a fan favorite character in the end was pointless and stupid. That really turned me off. Especially if they plan to make a sequel to this.Thats my opinion from JUST seeing it. Maybe I'll change some viewpoints after a while, maybe I won't. I am interested in what other people think though. Rogue One for me is still the best Disney SW movie. I would say TFA was better but TLJ killed that movie aswell. So now it looks like Rogue One is the best they can do. I think I would have preferred Phil Lord and Chris Millers take on it. Maybe the movie would be kinda weird. But atleast it would be SOMETHING. It would atleast have a directors stamp on it. They are good directors and I like their movies. They are never generic and bland. Its a shame we are never going to see that version. Lets hope Lucasfilm hires a good director for their next spinoff (thats not the sequel to this thing).In short : its a 'meh' movie. You can easily wait and watch it somewhere else for cheap. There is no amazing scene or something epic that you NEED to watch (Nothing like the Darth Vader scene from Rogue One as example). Nothing happens thats maybe spoiler-y. I'd say avoid it and watch it for free in a few months. Just so you won't support this. Star Wars movies deserve better quality than this. I've seen cutscenes from Star Wars games that are better than this. Lucasfilm needs to stop playing it so safe and start listening to the fans. Start making movies for the fans, just like Marvel is doing. Respect your audience. Trust in them that they are fans and that they know the Star Wars lore, and go ahead and use that and build the mythology.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

1101,zzztigr,I predict no sequels as this movie remains SOLO,7,29 May 2018,"The bad thing about Solo is the villain...there really isn't one, at least consistently. The thing that seems to really driving the film is time, a constant need to beat the clock...and sure Han has a fast ship, but no one is really consistently chasing him. We all race against time, which is why we dont want to watch someone else do it, it's just not that gripping. The cast is good, the characters are there, I liked the throwbacks and the Chewie and Han buddy blossoming... There were some good jokes, some nice Easter eggs, but no clear adversary. They had two or three good candidates, but rather than promoting them front and center, they are relegated to minor character status. I was in the mood for some mindless fun, and the movie is that at least.If I had one piece of advice for script writers it would be to start with the villain...BTW Hans military career might have been interesting, but I guess we'll never know. The film isn't doing that we'll, and I feel bad for the fans and Ron Howard, because the right story could have made this a winner, but I predict no sequels as this movie remains....solo",Solo - A Star Wars Story
1102,Finn_Rllm,Better than I expected it to be,7,23 May 2018,"*Very small spoilers, but only discribing topics for people to know of which part of the movie i talk.*So when I read the first news about the director problems and saw the trailers I really thought this one would be unwatchable bad, but after seeing the movie by myself I wouldn´t say it is that bad. Still not great, but way better than many people told me (often without seeing it).So the first fear I had, when I saw the first trailer was the humor. The trailer teased us with the typical disney-like formula humor and I really thought this would be to much in this movie. The movie has of course many of these moments where it exactly has this kind of humor, but there are also moments were it is very serious and dramatic without this kind of fun. 
*Small Spoiler*
The war scene at the beginning really catched me and I wish rogue one would have had more moments like these. This was one of these more dark and grown up scenes, which i really enjoyed.
Also so fight on the train had those serious vibes.
*Spoiler end.*
Also Solo is technically very well made and good produced. The score differs much more when it comes to the theme of some characters and gives a new fresh feeling. This fresh feeling could kill the Star Wars feeling for some people and this is also what I noticed.
All in all this Star Wars movie doesn´t feel so much like it is one. I think this could be the reason for the bad rating. 
The look of the movie reminded me in some cases a little bit of Mad Max. Not that clean like the real star wars look like. More dirty and fading.
I am absolutly okey with that, because I like the way how they try to differ 'a star wars story' from the other movies and I like a more grown up narration, but many people will have a different opinion. The actors made a good job in my opinion. Of course the mission to establish a second harrison ford is impossible. If you see Alden Ehrenreich´s interpretation of the young solo stand alone, than I think he made a good job, when you think about how impossible his mission was to satisfy all fans. The rest made a good job too, Donald Glover as Lando Calrissian was great and was fun to watch.
For Star's lover, the movie may turn out to be 2 stars worse, due to the maybe lost star wars feelings, but even when this is the case we have a really entertaining well made action/adventure movie. So for people which are not that affected by Star Wars and just enjoy the movies like i do it is a 7 out of 10. It will not be the greatest of all time, but it has good moments which give hope for the future.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
1103,emileecollier,No one wanted or needed this film.,7,27 September 2018,I was expecting this movie to be a train wreck I mean there was problems with production and it was hard to think someone else could play Han Solo than Harrison Ford. Alden Ehrenreich did a good job as Han Solo. He had great chemistry with Emilia Clarke character. The actors did a job of not during a impression of the actors who have played the character before . There twists in this movie I didn't see coming and that hard for prequel to do. The villain was ok he wasn't bad but he wasn't that good either. I like this film more then I do Rogue One. But I think Star Wars movies in the future need to focus on different character then the Skywalker family. I really like how they had Chewbacca and Han meet in this film. There were also some beautiful shots in the film. Donald Glover does a good job as Lando.,Solo - A Star Wars Story

It seems trendy and if you are willing to throw preconceived views out the window and actually watch it, you'll love it! It truest felt like a Star Wars movie. No crazy depth (though none of them really have...) and a fun action movie. Alden I'd an excellent job and I actually saw him as Solo, even emulated Harrison's mannerisms. Donald embodied the spirit of Billy Dee almost to a T. The empire recruitment and battle brought joy as I've always wanted to see it presented in a WWII type of way. Action and fun from start to end and even the down times worked to connect and bring life to the characters.

And, unlike Rogue One, this movie doesn't have any boring spots. It keeps you interested and wondering what is going to happen next, all the way through. Lots of fan service, which is fine. And a major character reveal at the end of the movie that brought me to the edge of my seat! Definitely a sequel or two ahead involving a well-known planet and slug, along with the mentioned surprise character. And possibly some tie-ins with the upcoming Obi-Wan movie.

I don't know why everyone was hating on the guy before the movie ever showed.Unique characters; well rounded, complex characters; funny characters (repeated 3 times due to how much TLJ needs to learn from this movie). I like the robot (L3 ?) the most. Lots of classic Star Wars bar scenes and funny little creatures. I felt like each character in the movie has complex and had a definative purpose in the story. The costume design was amazing!! My only two negative things to say is that I felt the music in this film was not as sweeping and centeral to the story as in other Star Wars films.

Flicking through Netflix, Solo came up as a suggestion. I am happy to say I changed my mind. I found it to be an excellent adventure with great acting, plot and action. The characters are likable, the locations are great and it really feels like a genuine Star Wars film. Films nowadays suffer from a blandness that has you walking out of theatre stating ""it was just alright"", ""so so"" or ""it was middle of the road"" and then forgetting instantly what you just watched, this is not one of them films.

1117,ariwebbkatanos,Solo: A Star Wars Story Review,8,6 June 2018,"So this Tuesday I managed to cut some time out of my schedule and check out the latest Star Wars movie. While the latest string of spin offs and sequels has largely left me wanting, I actually quite enjoyed this new film. It held less of the things I haven't liked about the other recent Star Wars films, but many of the things I don't like in action films in general. Despite this, I found that there was still a lot to enjoy. In essence, the film performs well as an addition to the Star Wars canon. It connects well to the universe and has all it needs to make a good 'Star Wars' movie. Where it fails is in the typical action movie areas, visually unimpressive, safe dialogue and poor pacing/stakes. Starting with the visuals, the film had good prospects early on. Corellia I found to be quite nice on the eyes, but the rest of the film didn't strike out very well. Cinematography rarely came anywhere close to creative, but didn't detract from the experience either. This isn't exactly a break from Star Wars tradition, but a change would have been nice to see. The dialogue in the film was pretty dry. Now I understand the there is a fine line between dry dialogue and the dialogue I enjoyed in the prequels and original trilogy. I think the dialogue by and large lacks that operatic quality that George Lucas and his writers often inserted. Instead it stays in that all-to-safe area of dry and boring. The biggest issue I had with the film is specific. Towards the middle of the film, around two thirds of the way in, the main cast find themselves in a life or death situation while in the millennium falcon (hope I'm not spoiling anything). This scene was fine visually and in it's presentation but it's placement was ridiculous. The rest of the film keeps to such a roguish pace, so having such a bombastically out of place scene in the film really ruined my enjoyment for a while. It's clear they were trying to emulate the Asteroid scene from Episode V, even with the music. But one thing the Asteroid scene in Episode V did not do was raise the stakes of the film far beyond that set by the rest of the story. Overall, that was my biggest issue with the film. Now onto what I did like. The films score I found to be great. This may be personal to me as I really enjoyed the score to Episode V and there was a reference to it in Solo. However in the rest of the film, noticeably good scoring makes itself apparent often. It really helped add to that 'Space Opera' sort of thing Star Wars is known for. Canonically, the film is the best addition to the new Star Wars universe since Disney bought the franchise. Rogue One failed in connecting itself to the larger Star Wars world beyond the obvious but I spotted far more numerous references in this film than any other. Anyone who has already seen the film knows it makes one huge connection to the larger SW expanded universe that I really appreciated. The last thing I liked was it's rather unpredictable plot. Though I was sort of expecting it since it's a film about rogues and smugglers, I was pleasantly surprised with what they came up with. Certainly worth a watch. Oh and in my opinion, Alden Ehrenreich did a good job as Han. In summary, Solo is just another regular action/heist film but as a 'Star Wars' film it performs quite well and that is something that means a lot to me. I'll give it an 8/10.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

I prefer it to some of the recent adventure movies for sure. But I still fell like the whole ""Star Wars thing"" is just a catalyst to make us watch the movie and not in any way building on the Star Wars saga and universe.I enjoyed the film enough to recommend it as a pure adventure movie.

There was no shock, no realization when Yoda reminded Ben, ""...there is another.""Some millennials even liked the abomination, Jar-Jar Binks. Here's the thing. If you're a true Star Wars fan, you sat there watching 'Solo' and nodded, chuckled and even winked to your friends each time it ticked off another detail (or, Easter Egg, if you may). Many of us who saw Star Wars when they were still in single digits understood where Ron Howard was taking us, and believe me, we had not forgotten what he did to us with 'Wilow,' but he had directly many good movies as well.This movie was plain old FUN.

But overall the movie was very enjoyable and some scenes managed to get me off my seat. Alden Ehrenreich did good to the character but the feel of Harrison Ford's Han Solo wasn't there. Of course taking the fact that the movie takes place 5-10 years before A New Hope Ehrenreich's Solo leaves room for the character development that is to happen during the years in between.The movie has a few amazing sequences and did bring back quite a lot of nostalgia. As a fan of the prequels (including Clone Wars) I got a few answers that I wanted and the movie brought out the best of the Millennium Falcon. Fans who don't limit themselves to just the movies and watch the animated series and read comics are going to love the movie. The plot is simple and is portrayed well.

1126,jurassicsean,This movie is fine. Why so much hate?,8,6 June 2018,"I understand that people were not looking forward to this film. I wasn't initially. But then the trailers dropped, and I was liking it a little more. I was skeptical when going into this, but after seeing it, this movie is fine. It's actually good. It's not great, but that's ok. I think I needed a fun action-packed Star Wars film after The Last Jedi. Let's start with the things I liked. The CGIonce again is phenomenal. Those guys at ILM are blowing my mind with what they can do. The practical effects and costumes are once again gorgeous. The technical aspects of this movie are overall really good. The direction annd camera-work is not great, but I'll get to that later. The music was new and fresh for Star Wars. I could barely tell this was even John Powell for most of it. The acting was all solid. Everyone gave a decent performance, but I'll get back to this later as well. I also like how the Empire was not the main antagonist again. This time it's crime syndicates and crime lords which was a nice change of pace. This movie needed to be smaller scale, and it was. The last thing I want to mention is the fact that this movie gets weird at times. Which is great! This honestly felt like an episode from ""The Clone Wars"", which was a great feeling. The other spinoff films should feel more like this. To finish off this segment, I'll say that I liked this one more than Rogue One. Just a little bit more. Ok, so what didn't I like. Well, let's talk direction first. The camera-work is definitely not bad, but it's not as impressive as The Last Jedi. The editing was also kinda choppy at points, which I get that this movie is very fast-paced, but sometimes it feels a little too fast. Lastly, we have characters. None of the characters are terrible per se, but they're weak. Han Solo especially I did not like. It's not Alden portraying him that was the issue, because he was fine. It was the fact that Han Solo has poor motivations for doing anything. His relation with Qi'ra and Chewbacca also didn't feel organic to me. They also did a few unexpected things with secondary characters that I didn't expect, but I can't deived if I like it or not. In any case, people are being a bit too harsh on this film I believe. You can certainly have your own opinions on the movie. I'm not trying to change them, and I do agree with some of the criticism, but this isn't a bad film at all. It's better than the prequels and RoguecOne in my opinion. And for people wanting to see a fun Star Wars movie, this is a nice addition to see.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

1128,KidWithOpinions,"Oceans 11, in space(and without George Clooney)",7,11 July 2018,"Solo: A Star Wars Story is the fourth installment in Disney's Star Wars prequel universe. This movie got slammed by critics, but to be completely honest, I really liked it. So I would give it a B-, for its lazily written story but also its enjoyable story.
 Solo has been getting really bad reviews, and there was one that I read and it said that as long as The Phantom Menace has Jar Jar it will still be the worst but that Solo comes in second place. Now I do not agree with that because Solo was a really good movie, now I will not say that it was the best movie because Rogue One will forever be my favorite Disney Star Wars movie. As I was reading more reviews, I pinpointed the parts that I agreed with and the parts that I disagreed with. One of the big parts that I do agree with is the fact that it was a lazily written story, but it was still an enjoyable story.
 The movie was very predictable so that kind of ruins it because you know what comes next, but like I keep saying it was still an enjoyable movie. Now what I really liked about Solo and Rogue One was that these movies are showing us the darker side of the Star Wars cinematic universe, like there is a scene where you see Han in the middle of an Imperial front. Ron Howard shows us the actual war in Star Wars! It's amazing, and I love it, I would love to see more movies like that!

I had been really looking forward to this one. The story was ok, one would guess that Han came from this kind of background. I did like how he met Chewy, that was kind of funny. It did not meet my high expectations though, especially after Rouge One which I thought tied in nicely with episode IV. We got to see how Han met Lando, Chewy, how he got the Falcon and even how he got his name! It is a pity that Disney does it now, it should have stayed in the hands of Lucas and his vision, Disney is more money hungry than a quality film maker. (Ya, Ya... spoken like a true fan I know!)

1132,kristianSeverens,Disney problems in a movie with potential,6,30 December 2018,"So I am by no means someone who hates Disney or star wars, but the combination is a problem in this movie. The characters, besides the one we already know, have almost no backstory to them. They really just remind me of the characters in Disney movies. Flat. We have the princess, the villain and the guy who goes and save the princess. It is ironic since that is exactly the story of the first star wars, but they did it right. So what is the difference? Star wars has always been darker of tone. The characters had backstory if they needed some, and if they didn't you got a feel for their personality without it being thrown in your face as a stereotype. This movie just has a bunch of people thrown in a ship, of whom half of them have no backstory or depth to their characters, and throw them on a casual adventure and throw in a lot of clichés to appeal to the star wars fans. So is it a bad movie? No. It is an all right movie, but Disney is throwing away the rough diamond they have and make something else instead.

I'm so glad that I'm not wedded to the Star Wars mythology, but instead am able to enjoy the escapism provided by each successive episode as a stand-alone entertainment. I've never understood why some place such high value on adherence to what they believe to be inviolable plot and character threads, but maybe that's a generational thing. At age 78, I really don't give a rat's patoot whether it all hangs together. Reminds me of William Shatner's infamous remark on SNL - for which he later felt compelled to atone - about Trekkers and their obsessions over Star Trek's faithfulness to its presumed themes: ""I'd just like to say... get a life, will you people? I mean, for crying out loud, it's just a TV show!"" My sentiments exactly. Star Wars: They're just movies.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

Turns out, it is a decent enjoyable action film set in the Star Wars universe. The story is pretty straight forward and doesn't derail anywhere . I really liked the guy who they cast for Han Solo's role. Witty, funny, sarcastic, all character traits that are associated with this character are there. They made more good choices in the actor department in Woody Harrelson and Paul Bettany I think. Emelia Clarke is a bit bland but still acceptable (gorgeous woman though). The action scenes are great, I particularly loved the part with the train heist. I liked that this film gives you an inside look of life under the rule of the Galactic empire, something we have not seen much of in Star Wars yet.

1143,dino-141,Boring Firefly rip off,1,25 December 2018,"I am glad of two things: That I didn't have to pay for this movie and that I was assembling my sons Christmas present while watching so I didn't utterly waste 2 hours of my life.
The story and setting reminded me more of Firefly than Star Wars - minus the brilliant stories, excellent acting, great chemistry among the actors, the humor and of course no Morena Baccarin.
Alden Ehrenreich gives his best to give a good Harrison Ford impression, alas he did not accomplish much. The only one standing out was Woody Harrelson because - well he is Woody Harrelson.
They tried to give his and Emilia Clarks character some depth but failed miserably because they behaved more like schezophrenic than multi layered characters.
Prequels are always difficult because we know the outcome already, so you have to work really hard to make the story interesting and answer questions about events and characters the audience really has.
Now, what have we learned from the three classic characters?
Chewie was practically non existent-
We learned that Lando used to have sideburns and had a very disturbing relationship with Harry Muds robot wife.
Did we learn anything new about Han Solos character? No. Why not? Because they haven't understood the character at all, so they had nothing to add.This movie even failed on the single point where even The Last Jedi delivered - the special effects. They looked cheap and cheesy. They probably wasted most of the budget on reshoots and director switches.All of this leaves the viewer with one single question: Why does Kathleen Kennedy still have a job?",Solo - A Star Wars Story

What's good? Well contrary to popular opinion, I enjoyed the character interplay and the story. Solo takes a different route in it's plot; perhaps not a particularly vital one, but an interesting deviation from the usual formula. Things never work out as smoothly as planned, and motives are torn between personal gain and morality, which is not so unlike the world we live in. Han Solo is in a perpetual juggling act, trying to loosen the noose that's never truly off his neck. Alden Ehrenreich took a fair amount of heat over his acting of the role, but I couldn't disagree more. He was nonchalant with a quirky edge, and it was obvious he was trying to attribute some of his wry smiles and disposition to the legendary Harrison Ford's interpretation. Perhaps that's where people feel jaded about him, not quite Harrison, but seems to find a common ground that does remind me of his older self. I would imagine it would also be a struggle for Alden to perfectly capture an entirely different man's take on the role, and I don't think the role requires an award winning performance to do it justice.I would certainly recommend as a low-key watch; entertaining and refreshing. Visuals are great, and of course you'll get a dose of the Star Wars styled action of lasers and galactic ships.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

1152,frank_foresta,"A Fun, Welcome Addition To The Star Wars Canon",8,26 May 2018,"Star Wars movies as of late, namely The Last Jedi, have had an uphill battle in the court of public opinion. This movie suffers the same fate. Before the movie came out, fans made up their minds that this new Han wasn't up to snuff, that the movie was unnecessary, and that it wouldn't be very good. I heard it countless times when I asked friends/fellow fans when they were going to see it - and I don't think that's fair. You should see it before judging it and I think this movie is pretty damn good.To start, relative newcomer Alden Ehrenreich is the perfect young Han Solo. It shouldn't be compared to Harrison Ford because this outing in no way attempts to usurp him. Ehrenreich's aura as Han is awesome - and exactly how I always imagined a young Han to be. As for whether the movie is unecessary, I don't think so. It's a fun way to see all the moments of Han's story never captured on film - meeting Chewbacca, first seeing the Millenium Falcon, meeting Lando, etc and I had a lot of fun seeing them. The story itself is pretty good too - with a few ending surprises to boot. It continues an extra 10 minutes to set up future installments should they come to fruition, which I was a little 'eh' about, but the central narrative that they tell is engaging, entertaining, and cool. I enjoyed Solo and I will be seeing it again. Definitely recommend.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

In comparison to other scripts this was quite a genius one. And it was witty and clever and much more SW than Rogue one (which is also good), and no, as we were afraid, it is not a comedy.

1156,AdventureWolf,More fun than you can shake a saber at...,10,24 May 2018,"Ok, before we go in, let's get the blindingly obvious out of the way - Harrisons Fords Han Solo is such a cultural icon that no-one can emulate it. But, that fact alone does not mean that this movie was destined to fail, as so many reviews seem to focus on...In fact, IMHO, Solo is an absolute triumph! I and my family sat spellbound for 135 mins with huge grins on our faces and left the theatre feeling immensely happy and thoroughly entertained. True, the movie isn't packed with surprises, we all know Han and Chewie survive, so the stakes aren't high, but wow, it's a real blast seeing Hans back story unfold before us in loud and bright filmic form!The film is also loaded with easter eggs for the fans - all respectfully done and non-intrusive to the story. My sons and I had a great fun spotting them and then discussing later. The major action sequences, especially the raid on the transport train, are thrillingly shot and, most importantly, great fun.Alden Ehrenreich was fantastic as the young Solo and I (a devoted Star Wars fan since 1980) found it easy to get into the groove that he was a younger version of the character I grew up with. Thankfully, he's not tried to fully emulate Ford (no one could!), but has presented a solid and believable version of what a young Solo could have been like. It worked for me.The story is a greatest hits of Han Solos past (how he meets Chewie, gets his iconic blaster, completes the Kessel run and wins the Falcon) and there have been howls of protest over this, labelling the story as derivative and boring. Well, there would have been howls of protest had these incidents not been included in the movie, and the way in which they are shown is a hell of a lot of fun.And fun is what I want from a Star Wars movie, as well as a nostalgic throwback to the rush I got watching them as a kid.

1159,michaeleb1025,This is just plain awful,1,27 September 2018,"Ther are so many reasons on so many levels why this movie is terrible, I will give just a few reasons. Casting is the first. None of the leads seems to fit the parts they are cast to play. Donald Glover is the worst. Why Woody Harrelson? None of the actors had the humor or gravitas to carry their portrayals to a level of acting above a bad episode of Xena Warrior Princess. Chemistry between leads was pathetic. Villains lacked menace. Attempts at humor were lost in poor line delivery. Camerawork and color correction were disastrous. To say this film was bleak is an understatement. It was a brownish gray excremental mess. A 4K copy only reveals this more. I have never had a more unpleasant 4K watching experience. Hair and costumes looked like they were borrowed from a lot of other movies. There was a pony tail style on one of the female leads that looked like it was straight out of a stage production of Grease. Childish Gambino's Hawaian shirt was also a poor choice. There was also no sense of spectacle like in the other Star Wars movies. When there was a potentially interesting large set piece it was usually stripped of its impact with the extemely bleached out color correction. Obviously Ron Howard was a very very poor choice to direct this franchise. When you do not care about the characters at all, why bother? I could go on and on, but that would be wasting an enormous amount of time. The important thing is that you do not waste your time and money watching it. It does nothing to further the Star Wars canon unless you are an idiot fan boy who will watch anything and everything and have no sense of what a good film can be.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

Instead of being transported to a galaxy far, far away, Solo: A Star Wars Story feels close to home; and feels like an inferior copy of better made earthly heist, car chase, action, mystery, romance, war, train robbery, prison break and western films. It's uneven, anachronistic (what do robots want?: ""Equal Rights!"") and ultimately unsatisfying.There is also nonsensical motivation. In the ending, Han has the ship he wants, and his best friend, and no debt. Also, the woman he was after leaves him (the reason he wanted the ship in the first place). So, he has no obligations to anyone. Plus, the people who wanted to kill him are all dead. Also, he just won a big hand at the gambling table, so he has a lot of money. So what does Han do? He decides to follow the advice of Tobias Beckett and go to Tatooine. Wait, what? Tobias Beckett just tried to kill him, and admitted this with his dying breath. Tobias Beckett just double crossed Han and used as pretext that he, Beckett, was going to Tatooine, but instead Beckett actually hung around to double cross Han. So, why go to Tatooine at all? There are good parts. Chewy gets to do more in this film than all the other films put together and that's a good thing. Lando is entertaining. Alden really grew on me throughout the movie. They show how Solo gets his name and weapon, and have a ton of fun fan service (for example, the Lando Jabba Palace outfit, Mandalorian armor in the background, hologram chess, reference to Bossk, etc.). The creatures felt like Star Wars. Ultimately, however, it felt like given the clear things that had to happen because of the later films, Solo desperately tries to misdirect and confuse the audience with double crossing, who-is-your-friend?, trickery, but the film ends up with confusing plot holes. Plus, It does not know what kind of a film it wants to be (see first sentence) and ends up being less than the sum of its earthly parts.

1173,Deloron,A great example for an average movie,5,25 May 2018,"***Warning Spoilers***Plot: 
The Plot could be summarized as a heist movie in the Star Wars Universe. There are some Twists, but they don't stand out (besides one). Some characters are rushed, especially Qi'ra. We don't know much about her past and probably never will (if we don't get a Sequel). The pacing is inconsistent. Sometimes it is pretty neat, but then again a bit slow. There is no real flow or hook. The movie has some tense scenes, but they aren't a big deal, because you can smoothly figure out what is going to happen. As a whole, the Plot will not surprise nor impress you. It is as generic as it could be.
Average 5/10Characters: 
The characters have generally the motivation you would imagine. Reasons are: money, love and survival. Most of the times, these reasons seem not to be enough nor interesting. Some of them have no development at all. There is not much going on from this side. The only one with slight development is Han himself, but that's no big deal. We could say that the movie focuses more on relationships between the characters. There are some that are heartwarming and interesting like Chewbacca + Han and Lando + Han. The movie succeeded in this matter (besides the worst robot ever, thank you Disney).
Decent 6/10Dialogue:
The dialog focuses mostly on nostalgia, which does work sometimes but feels kind off chessy. They feel lifeless, even if they try to be funny. There are no smart, witty and funny dialogues. To be fair, they get better overtime. 
Average 5/10Style:
The movie has interesting colour schemes on the different planets. The visuals aren't as impressive as in The Last Jedi, but they are still good. It is as expected, good.
Good 7/10Actors:
The don't stand out nor deliver special performances. They are just fine, way better than in other recent Star Wars movies. Donald Glover made an excellent job, he was really believable.
Good 7/10Genre:
It's a science fiction heist movie. The heist part seemed bad, there was the heist feeling, but they executed it poorly. As a science fiction movie, it seemed okay.
Average 5/10Originality:
There was like nothing original in the movie besides the female robot, but that would be a bad example. That was a huge let down.
Terrible 3/10 Atmosphere:
There is Star Wars feeling, that creates already a good atmosphere. They nailed it on the desert planets too. The quietness disturbed by some minor sounds felt great. That was surely a pleasant surprise. 
Good 4/5Editing:
The editing was average. There were no special or outstanding cuts. As expected.
Average 5/10Soundtrack:
The soundtrack does support the movie scenes. But again, is is sad that they don't use some of the original tracks, expect remixes.
Good 7/10CGI:
The animation looked good. The scene in the maelstrom was a huge succes, it looked gorgeous. I saw no flaws.
Good 4/5Evaluation:
The movie was mediocre nearly all the time. It was enjoyable, nonetheless.

After the first could minutes of the film, however, I knew it wasnt going to ve that great. At the end, when Beckett turns on Solo and Qi'ra, it is pretty predictable. And when Qi'ra tells Han shes right behind him, and - oh wow what a surprise - isn't right behind him.
 However, this movie is funny. Some of the reviews on IMBD have said that the jokes fall flat, which can be said for any movie in exsitence, but I found myslef laughing at 90% of the jokes.
 Overall, this movie is predictable, but is a must- see for Star Wars fans. While the movie can be boring at times, it does have a lot of heart, and gives you tons of background on the character we all know and love - EVEN HOW HE GETS HIS LAST NAME!",Solo - A Star Wars Story

Solo: corporate money hungry cash grab blah blah..(but really can't we say that about any of the films after Return of the Jedi?) Is the Latest film in the new Star Wars franchise. Only five month's after the last installment. The very Polarizing film The Last Jedi. Which in my own observation was the catalyst of the fatigue this new batch of films is setting in. Solo itself as a film is stuck in the line of fire as both fans, critics, and basic movie goers start voicing there backlash. But does Solo deserve this much heat?.... in my stans.... No, no it does not.... Now, don't get me wrong the film is no great master piece by any means. (Christ wouldn't even put it on favorite list of a hundred films) But it does give one element that the others in the Disney, Kennedy star wars films lack and that is a balance. A balance of different and nostalgia. Unlike force awakens which was too much a retread of new hope. Or last Jedi that was trying to left turn so hard it debunked all the set up of the previous film leaving a unfulfilling viewing experience. Rouge one was the closest to Accomplishing this prior to this but dropped the ball with character and flow. Solo now brings use a Coherent story set in the Star Wars universe that left me Invested. If 
I had to compare it, a western heist films with a dash of plot grabs of Olivier Twist. (There a scene that is straight out of twist) Dialogue was nothing special but believe bull now for the characters they were putting in front of us. Fine acting by everyone including Aiden Ehrenreich which I had my Reservations. Was sadden to hear the departure of Lord & Miller. And terrified of the news of Howard taking head of the film. (Man plays it too safe for my comfort) but seeing the final project, I was glad to see the filmmakers styles fitting so well. Visually appealing, really enjoyed the grainie vibe throughout. Editing 
Could have been better, but not too Distracting that it took me out of the film. Fun Ridiculous action sequences but none bad. One element I had trouble with was all the quick nostalgia pick ups. In the course of one film we basically get a crash course on how, when, and why Han receives all witch makes the character. (Had opening of last crusade flashback) all in all. A fine harmless film.

While the film doesn't push the boundaries, it is only there to fill in the gaps for people who haven't read every EU book or the TV series (Which I have not). The film doesn't have a 10 or 9 moment in it but stays relatively high at all other points. Worst part of the film is the first 15 minutes on Corellia, the chase scene really isn't good. The rest of it is a solid heist film and once you figure that out maybe some of the twists and turns can be predictable. References made are organically introduced and don't stand out. All the actors do a great job with their parts. The odd cut from the all the re-shoots stick out. The recent films have done a really good job of showing off the movement of the Falcon with no exception here. Han's and Chewie's relationship is explored and is great to see. When Chewie sits in the chair for the first time along with the score is a special moment for Star Wars fans and was really felt in the audience.As I say most of the film is at a high level with no major stand out moment or unique story, some of the fandom will see this as filler but if the films are all you've seen then you will be happy with the outcome.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

The biggest problem for me was the casting of Han Solo. I knew it as soon as I saw the actor for the first time. He was a TERRIBLE choice in my eyes. He's probably a nice fit in other roles, but for this one, it was all wrong. He had none of the charisma and, sorry to be superficial, but isn't half as handsome as Harrison Ford. In his defense, Harrison Ford is a really tough act to follow, but I still believe there's someone out there who could've done better. I hardly ever go into a movie checking my watch to see when it would be over, but it happened here. Overall the movie was just OK. I really didn't care about anyone's story. It felt more like a cash grab than anything. That's what you get when you sell your idea to Disney. The best part was the visuals; I think you gotta give props to Ron Howard for that. Also, it highlighted what a great actress Emilia Clarke is because she stole every scene and made the most of it.

1195,villain-16905,"Solid, well directed Sci-if adventure but not Star Wars",5,25 September 2018,"Think about all the elements that make up Star Wars and differentiate it from regular Science fiction fare. At the core, you have the force, jedi, sith, darkness and light etc etc etc. (Even Rogue one had a nod to mysticism without ever showing a Jedi Knight.)The force is always present in some form. Now add in the iconic characters, ships, planets and the 'used future' aesthetic. Everything working together making the wonder that is a Star Wars movie. It's a sum of its parts, isolate one aspect on its own, like an iconic character such as Solo and that's what you get. Just solo, one dimensional science fiction. 
Another key aspect that makes Star Wars successful is casting. The characters are bigger than the actors. You can't have well known movie stars, (with the exception of the odd classic star like Alec Guinness) playing major roles because It shatters suspension of disbelief. Woody Harrelson, fine actor, but already iconic as Woody from Cheers. Thandie Newton, fantastic actress, but all too present in the publics consciousness due to the current success of Westworld. Paul Bethany, terrific actor, but currently flying everywhere as Vision in Avengers. Star Wars has to be totally immersive. It's a Galaxy far far away not five minutes ago.
George Lucas understood this. Disney unfortunately does not. Solo could have been a smash, but while Disney is still in denial, blaming the frequency of releasing films, rather than a lack of true understanding of what Star Wars is, the future of the franchise looks grim.

I was mildly entertained. Unlike the 6 George Lucas movies, I have no intentions on watching it again.The story line isn't bad, but the movie is definitely missing something. The combination of actors and direction made this movie bland.Disney appear to be banking on the power of the franchise to save from spending too much on actors. The actor who portrayed Han Solo did not carry the movie very well especially when you consider he had to fill Harrison Ford's boots.Considering the contribution Han Solo brought to the franchise, Solo should have been a major hit. I guess there is just no replacing Harrison Ford.Disney are pouring a lot of money into these movies but they need to take a bigger risk to get it done better.This movie just blends in with all the other si-fi movies ever made. Take away the Star Wars universe and its below average. Actually, it felt a bit like the first episode of a TV series you'll lose interest after a few episodes.I am one of those that actually liked how George Lucas told the story.

1198,cicalinarrot,"A lot of good, nothing really that bad, nothing great except...",9,29 May 2018,"There's everything we expected: all the most famous and loved things about Solo explained. Very predictable: Chewie, the Falcon, Lando, even the dices (which originally seems to be just a tacky hint of his pretty generic past, not some important symbol), the ""i love you""-""I know"" joke, the Solo-shot-first thing. All of this things have been forced together. To make fans happy? I think Disney doesn't know us, nobody is happy because this kind of predictable references.But there's more. There's how Solo became what he is. When you first see a pretty non-ironic young passionate boy you ask yourself: is THIS supposed to be solo?! And when the transformation is slowly completed, every single bit of the character fits perfectly. Also because the incredible performance by Alden Thirdreich. He has made some serious work to put some Harrison Ford details into his acting in a very natural way. And the details make everything because you could never say what made Ford perfect but when you see them in the new boy you just say ""that's Solo!"". A smile, the way he holds the gun, a way of walking related to how he feels... just a great job.
So, the great part about Solo is... Solo. Both the screenplay and the acting.It seems like the heart and soul with their raison-d'etre are really good.And then there's the rest.
The usual aesthetic perfection only Mickey Mouse money can buy.
Some (many) a bit generic adventure movie parts.
It's a pretty serious movie. I feared a clowny Solo, Episode 7 style. But, getting a serious one, I still kinda wanted a few good, original touches of the mature Solo, not borrowed from the first trilogy.
I got a couple sexual innuendos instead: a black d*cks are big joke (about Lando! The only black guy in the old trilogy, the Martin Luther King of the old trilogy) and a robot-sex joke. Mmmh... mesa no happy.R1 is the SW movie we needed but not the one we deserved.

The dialogue was actually terrible at points. As far acting goes it was nothing special except for Woody Harolson and Paul Bettany who gave stellar. I feel like it is specifically relevent to talk about Alden Ehrenreich as Han Solo, he was allright though he can never be as good as Harrison Ford who literally created one of the most interesting characters in cinematic history, I feel like Alden was trying to portray a naiive Peter Parker like character for Han Solo at this point in his life but I feel like he did not commit himself to this. The characters were well developed for the most part even though some of them were a little annoying. The lighting was good but I felt it did not fit this movie. The set design was good as it always is in the super high budget star wars. The goid things about this movie that surprised were the cinematography and the original music in the score. The cinematography in this movie was great I considered it better than the cinematography in any other of the recent star wars movies this really helped the action scenes which I thoroughly enjoyed. I also really liked to the original music I would suggest that if you are seeing this film you should pay attention to the singing in the party scene and any music during scenes of the marauders. At the end of this movie there is a twist that is obviously being used to set up other movies I'm not going it but its something that was done in the expanded universe that I always thought was dumb and I thought that cinematic universe would have the self restraint not to use it.

Given that it's impossible for anyone to fill the boots of Harrison Ford, a third of the way through the movie Alden Ehrenreich's performance has me convinced. Donald Glover is a brilliant Billy Dee Williams aka Lando Calrissian right from the time we hear his voice. A story all it's own that only hints at the larger Star Wars story with just a few references, my favourite being to Episode 1 which really gets your imagination going... I shall say no more...

1205,ExpNoob19,Just a movie,7,5 June 2018,"This movie adds absolutely nothing to the Star Wars universe and simply details events mentioned as filler dialogue In the main films. While there are original characters and locations never seen before this movie feels all around risk-less. The film is also very predictable and quite humorless.The character of Han Solo isn't even really expanded on either, his new romantic interest Qi'ra who I assume the writers introduced to add more depth to Han Solo himself did nothing for the character. In my opinion her potential lies more in the sequels for this movie which will probably never happen considering it had the worst theatrical opening in the series. The recasting of Han Solo is fine. While he didn't have the iconic voice or face, the writing mixed with Alden Ehrenreich's charismatic performance works for the younger version of the character they were going for. Donald Glover as Lando Calrissian is alright, throughout the entire film he seem tired. Lando is supposed to be a laid back guy and his character was captured well in the writing, but his performance seemed a little too laid back. Most of the side characters aren't worth mentioning since they're pretty shallow but don't really need to be more than that. The droid character L3-37 was cringe worthy since she was just another sassy rebellious droid similar to K2-S0 and even BB-8, except she has the sass meter cranked up to 11. Her character is all about how she wants to be treated equally as a droid which was painful to watch as a parallel to the real world mistreatment of minorities since shes so unlikable in the first place. Paul Bettany delivers a pretty decent performance as the villain.Just like L3 the jokes are cringe worthy. Most of the time the soundtrack and timing didn't even shift properly to make way for the joke, not that it mattered since they were all horribly written, which is a shame since I honestly think more frequent and better written jokes could have saved the movie. There is one good exchange between Han and Lando near the end of the movie which is followed up a few minutes later by a predictable but still decent joke.The scene where Han kills Beckett feels all around weightless and predictable. It doesn't feel like as big of a deal as it's supposed to be since Han has been killing armies of disposable henchmen the entire movie and Beckett's character is so generic.The highlights of this movie are either the CGI space battle bullshit or the still humorless character interactions. I think this movie would actually work better as a start to a trilogy than a stand alone movie, but not a Solo trilogy. Instead make the trilogy about Darth Maul's crime syndicate except have a different protagonist each movie (Probably Boba Fett than Obi-Wan). That way people can get the character movies they want without throwing away all the setup of this film. Some of the side characters of this movie could also return (Probably just Qi'ra).",Solo - A Star Wars Story

There's no need for any added on scenes or an Easter egg every 2 minutes as this stands on its own legs with confidence.I really hope this gets the audiences to turn up so it gets the trilogy it deserves as there's loads of scope to develop these characters.

What the he'll did I just watch, This film is a full mess from start to finish, this film brings no life to the characters we knew and loved from the original trilogy, in fact it craps all over these characters without a thought as to what made us love them in the first place. It even goes as far as to have us believe that Lando Carlission is some sort of relation ship with his robot side kick. It plays no homage to the characters that Harrison Ford and Billy Dee Williams gave us, and made us believe in. Instead it would have us believe that Chewy was some fierce eat anything monster, that Lando likes to get it on with a toaster and Han had been heart broken all these years, on top of this we get the worst character since Rose Tico and Jar Jar binks in L3-37, which for some reason managed to grate so badly with me i wanted to stick a forks in my eyes and ears it was that bad.All the Star Wars films have had droids as a central character, but unlike L3-37 all the droids before have been funny and had character, but here we have a toaster that you wish some one would scrap immediately as it just spouts crap.Sadly this film adds nothing to the SW universe other than the one thing that needed to happen, and did what the Last Jedi should have done, in that it made the Disney machine stop rolling out more trash into the SW universe, unfortunately not before they had unleashed the last jedi which literally choose to burn the SW universe to the ground in one massive FU to all its fans.That said, at least Disney realised it's errors and will make sure the next film is true to the heart of the original trilogy......

As a standalone film, I thought the story was pretty decent, the actors were all really good (even the guy playing Han who did a convincing job) & the action scenes were exciting. Not as rewatchable as some of the others but definitely worth checking out. Now as far as all the negative reviews here go.....I grew up with Star Wars in the 70's and 80's and know full well how magical those first 3 movies were. But comparing these new films (with all new actors & almost all new characters) is not only totally unfair to the new films but also very unrealistic. Name me one sequel (non-James bond) made 40 yrs later that is just as good as the original films? Betcha can't. And newsflash to all the haters crying about how the Disney films have killed Star Wars.... Everything sucks when you go into it with a negative attitude (which most of you do). You just have to have an open mind. Plus, none of these new films are ever gonna be as good as you think they should be, anyway, so quit your whining & get over it already. These films are entertaining, fun and keeping the franchise alive so try to show a little more appreciation & be glad that they're still making them. .",Solo - A Star Wars Story
1229,sscott94,Dreadful Bore,4,1 October 2018,"Cons: Alden was a terrible choice in casting. He didn't need to imitate Harrison, but he at least needed to charm us - Zero charm. You can clearly see that he is saying the lines, instead of being in the moment. Donald Glover sounds like a boy pretending to a man's voice. The music was shoddy. Not engaging at all. The cinematography felt like low budget TV show.The pacing is a major problem. Should have trimmed AT LEAST 20 minutes off. Scenes drag on for way too long. The tone is all over the place. Based off the trailers, I had hoped for a Western tale. It was not at all. There are some Western style shots, there's a train robbery, however, it falls flat because ultimately, it becomes more concerned about twists to ""fool you"".The droid love story with Lando was just ridiculous. Zzzzz.The jokes were not groundbreaking and nowhere as good as other reviewers have made it out to be.WORST OF ALL, there is just no chemistry between any of the characters. There is no reason to care about any of them at all.Pros: Woody does a terrific job. Emila Clarke clearly carried the scenes w/ Alden, but was not given much to work with as her character is flat until the end where the ""twist"" is so obvious by that point.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

I went into this one with no expectations, but was pleased overall. It was mostly a solid action film with a plot that made sense and characters that were likable or at least interesting. About the only thing I didn't like was when it did start to get a little ""socially aware"" (which was one of the things I hated about TLJ), as Lando's droid was spouting off about equal rights for droids, but it wasn't overly distracting and did actually play into the plot somewhat.

It was clearly made for profit, lacks depth as a story and the (Star Wars) references stand out so weirdly, that at times it becomes purely comical, almost as if it was a parody of the franchise. I can see why it will be hard for fans to appreciate it, as for me, who was never a Star Wars fan, meant good entertainment. I went to the movies expecting easily digestible fun and that is exactly what I got. To me it wasn't any different than any other sci-fi/adventure blockbuster like Avengers or even Deadpool. I liked the comical aspects of it and I think the casting was done well.

Between weak writing (An example is when Tobias Beckett and Lando Calrissian are ""negotiating"" lando's cut for the job, Tobias's dialog caused instant face palm...) and laziness of not bothering to explain the ""diversity"" sandbox cast (unless we are expected to believe a 110 pound woman can manhandle a 170+ pound man or a dwarf would become a marauder who's society is built by ranking those with the most physical strength...) it was one disappointment after the other. Unexplained diversity that felt forced with out of place cast, forced/weak plot points and twists, predictable story arcs, and a pathetic ending is what, Solo: A Star Wars Story tells.Disney took what could of been the redemption of the last few Star Wars movies and instead continued down the SJW path of ruining Star Wars.The last 3 movies have been so bad I've not bothered to take my kids to, how many more movies like Solo will we have to put up with before you take the Franchise back to its roots where it tells a great story of love, tribulations, and triumphs?",Solo - A Star Wars Story

His mannerisms and even voice were spot on and really reminded me of a young Harrison Ford. (How are they going to work in the under-lip scar?)The Emilia Clarke character was complex despite the holes in her back-story. Perhaps the details are coming in her back story (to the back story)?Yes, the whole almost-drag-us-back-into-some-sort-of-black-hole scenario was ridiculous, but I forgave it because it ""explained"" the ""Kessel run in under 12 parsecs"" back story, and the ""rounded down"" quip was great.Thanks Ron Howard for the attention to detail and I can't wait for the (no doubt) Solo sequel.

It lines up better with the Skywalker mythos... young boy comes from nothing, learns some things, and saves a lot of people. The only difference is that Han is no hero, he stumbles along the path of goodness while trying to make himself some money, and then in true Han style he shoots first to save his own skin.

I am today regretful of my broad stroking the franchise, as I consider this film the best behind the original trilogy and the Mandalorian production. I enjoyed this immsensely, the sets are great, the acting is vivid and fun, wrapped inside a convincing atmosphere. The story is to me quite perfect for a character like Han Solo, and it managed to set the bedrock from which greater stories about this character could've been told.I can't really say why people gave this film so much hate and disregard, but it coincides with the cultural shift where people began hyping each other up to hate rather than appreciate.

The film is quite fast paced moving from action scene to action scene. While it is about Han Solo for the bulk of the film it is around the teams that he is partnered up with.
I watched it facing the fact that the Actor playing Han doesn't look much younger than Harrison Ford in A new Hope. You just have to accept that.
I enjoyed the story and despite others claiming that there was no suspense as obviously everyone knows Han and Chewey must make it out, there are a number of decent characters whose stories don't end up as happy endings. I thought the plot was a good story.I enjoy the new films and the darker approach to the narrative, they are still Disney but more adult.
There are a lot of people who don't want any deviation from the old films and have slated the new ones, but accept them for what they are and they are good films.I for one will definitely go to the Cinema for the next one, whatever the hordes of fanboys have to say.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

1255,oliverwilkins1,Millenium Pigeon,5,27 May 2018,"Watching Solo a Star wars story was a bit like going to a highly anticipated party but ending up spending the whole evening talking to the designated driver. The story is that of a young Hans solo and his development into the character we know from the original star wars movies. Except that the character development is minimal and the overlaying plot is vacuous. The movie is held together by astute acting performances from Bettany and Glover et al as well as well rounded graphics. The action scenes, although almost completely lacking in any sense of threat, are functionary and not un-engaging. Having known the struggles that the movie faced in production, with the director being changed over half way through and as much as 70% of the movie having to be re-shot it was highly visible to me that parts of the film had been shoehorned together in a jarring and clunky fashion. The movie was highly unfunny, the one liners interjected throughout barely managing an under breath chortle and more often than not a confused sideways glance at the audience to see if i had missed something. The immersive natural Landscapes that we have come to associate with the Star Wars franchise were conspicuously missing as were the light sabers. This is another tarnish against a well loved and devoutly followed movie phenomenon that unceremoniously taps into the money tree that is Star Wars, slowly draining it of all the life that it once had.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

1257,tillman-89878,Answers all the questions you never asked,4,6 October 2018,"Ever wondered why the nose of the Millennium Falcon is forked instead of pointed? No! Me neither, but wonder no more.This is basically the essence of Solo. It takes every little throw away line and hint of a past from previous SW stories and adds a back story. Rogue One took the opening crawl of ANH and added depth to what was already known, for example getting an in universe explanation for why there was no blue squadron in ANH when the actual reasons were due to limitations of tech at the time, worked well. And the prequel trilogy, whilst flawed, was answering the questions that had at least been asked.But where these approaches worked for those films they fall flat for a character like Han Solo because he's a person whose back story is best left a mystery. He's basically the guy you'll find sat at the end of any bar in the country retelling tales of adventures past and whilst you know the stories are littered with bs they're no less entertaining. I for one am happy to accept that Han (with the exception of Chewie) only cares about himself and money. It's what makes the loveable rogue so appealing. It's only when he meets Luke, Leia and Co that his character develops into someone who considers the greater good.In Solo we start to see the making of the Han we meet in ANH but, as said, he's a character whose back story is best left either to the imagination or simply just believing he's always been like that. The Kessel run for example is only referenced in 2 films and whilst acknowledging there's probably a cool back story the only one we need is that it happened in less than 12 parsecs, the rest of the mystery is in keeping with the character. But now we know exactly how this went down including the issue of a parsec being a measure of distance and not time.Other burning issues we didn't need answering include: how he came by his surname (because obviously being given it at birth is not cool enough) and how his blaster came to be.The dice was particularly irksome. When you first glimpse them hanging in Han's speeder you're thinking it's a cool little easter egg and obviously he'll grab them and later hang them in the cockpit. But no, apparently they deserve elevation above easter egg status and require their own character arc. Which BTW completely undermines Luke handing his sister a keepsake from her late husbands beloved ship in TLJ, because now it turns out they were a reminder to Han that those he loves most will ultimately betray him.OK, it was obvious we were going to see Han acquiring the Falcon from Lando, but it was just something I had no desire to see. We already knew it was won in a card game and didn't really need to see how this went down. Likewise it was equally obvious that we'd see the first meeting between Han and Chewie. And whilst this was an intriguing premise it was executed poorly. We really didn't need to see a worse Wookie impression than my own (which is saying something) when it's already established these characters can speak in their respective languages and understand each other perfectly well, and certainly didn't need an explanation into Han shortening Chewbacca's name.Getting away from the needless back stories now. I've given this film 4 stars because actually hidden somewhere deep in this movie as actually a good heist story. The train heist is the stand out sequence of the movie and the heist that follows this (despite focusing so much on the Kessel run) is a decent story too. The code of honour that these characters live by is believable. They basically finish the job or die trying because the consequences from those they work for are a fate worse than death if they fail. And I particularly like the assume everyone will betray you and you won't be disappointed ethos.But this starts to come undone in the bloated final act (which is why I haven't rated higher than 4) when the story switches from old fashioned heist movie to old fashioned western. Han starts to develop a conscience (and I know I've bleated on about this enough already) when it would be in keeping with the character to believe he doesn't develop one until the Battle of Yavin in ANH.As for the acting. Donald Glover, Paul Bettany, Emilia Clarke, Thandie Newton and Woody Harrelson as always turn in great performances but are hampered by the material they had to work with. Donald Glover particularly nails the part of Lando though the part with him wailing over his dead droid is completely out of character. Again this is more an issue with the script than his acting chops. Alden Ehrenreich though whilst acting decently enough does not come across as the Han we know and love. Where believing Glover will one day become Billy Dee Williams I cannot vision this character one day being Harrison Ford.And as for the twist ending the appearance of Darth Maul is there for no other reason than to provide a ""squee"" moment. Even my 9 year old son said WTF is he doing there? (OK he didn't use the F) surely it would make more sense for Jabba or the Emperor to be the master mind. I'm not bigging up my son or anything but when he understands the story more than a respected film maker like Ron Howard you do have a moment of pride. That said I am intrigued to see what comes next from the characters of Maul and Qi'ra, which is ironic considering this is meant to be a film all about Han Solo.To summarise this is a film that has great potential but ultimately does not equal the sum of its parts. Which I can only deduce is down to the extensive reshoots as this summers The Predator (another film with highly publicised reshoots) was much the same, in respect that the all the puzzle pieces were there but in the end did not fit.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

1259,kenobi-00688,Certainly Better Than Expected,8,2 June 2018,"So much of an improvement over The Last Jedi which was the most divisive and terribly written Star Wars movie in the franchise. Solo is not perfect, but I would encourage those who didn't like The Last Jedi to go see Solo. Solo is a fun ride with a lot less of the social politics nonsense that The Last Jedi was full of. I really enjoyed seeing the beginning of Han and Lando's friendship and the filling in of some of Han's backstory. The cast was solid and there were strong performances by Woody Harrelson, Thandie Newton, Emelia Clarke, Donald Glover and Paul Bettany. From the trailers I was worried about Alden Ehrenreich's performance as Han, but I was presently surprised that he made role his own with a little hints here and there of Harrison Ford portrayal. Now I'm not saying that he is Harrison Ford, but he did a decent job. If they decide to continue Han's story with a sequel, which I hope they do because I want to see what happens with Darth Maul and Kira. Also, if they do another movie Alden has some room to grow in the role seeing that they decided to write his character starting out as a hero who goes down a dark path before later redeeming himself in a New Hope. Now Han's backstory could of started out as much darker character, but I could see Han's backstory starting out this way. There were some nice mentions and cameos in the movie, such as learning that Beckett had killed Aura Sing a bounty hunter from the prequels and Clone Wars and the appearance of Darth Maul which was pretty awesome to say the least and fills a little bit of his story between the Clone Wars and Rebels. There also some other nice Easter eggs and surprises to keep an eye out for throughout the movie, but I won't give everything away.Ron Howard did a good job of directing and certainly gets what Star Wars is about unlike Rian Johnson the director of The Last Jedi. Ron Howard made Solo a fun movie full of action and twists which is how Star Wars should be. Ron Howard did a really good job for coming into project so late and getting this movie turned around. The Music was okay and of course the special effects were solid as they are always are in a Star Wars movie.There were a few things that I didn't like in the movie, I didn't really care for Lando's droid L3-37, I didn't like that they killed off Thandie Newton's character so early in the movie and then there was a section of the movie that was a little on the slow side, but overall it was a pretty good ride and it left me wanting to see more. Now I keep hearing that because Solo was not doing well at the box office that there is a ""Star Wars fatigue"" which is total BS. I would go to another Star Wars movie tomorrow if they came out with one, Marvel puts out 3-4 movies a year and I go to each one. The problem is that The Last Jedi was a horrible epic failure, Kathleen Kennedy's poor management, Politics being inserted into the Star Wars movies, backlash by Lucasfilm employees and SJW idiots at the fans who didn't like The Last Jedi, poor story telling, poor character development and rehashes of old storylines from the original SW movies in TFA and TLJ. That why people are not showing up for Solo. Give us good stories and don't ruin characters that are beloved like Luke, Leia and Han which they did in the new saga. Have a game plan and take your time tell us an interesting story and take your cues from Marvel and we we'll show up. For those who didn't like TLJ and I HATED IT, give this movie a chance don't let the bad taste of TLJ discourage you from seeing Solo.It's not a perfect movie, but it is a much more enjoyable than the TLJ. Plus it can't get any more worst than TLJ, the only way is up from there.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
1260,aprilcullen-24458,Here's what I think of Solo,8,26 May 2018,"I thought this movie was great. It had a great cast, a well thought out story, and was just a lot of fun for me as a huge Star Wars fan. When Darth Maul came out at the end, I had a huge dumb smile on my face and was so happy to see my second favorite Star Wars villain (first Being Darth Vader). The ONLY thing in this movie that truly bothered me was Qi'ra. Don't get me wrong she was a good character and was well rounded, but I can't stand how they made her Han's Lover. They could have made her just a childhood friend or even his sister or something. But no they had to have a romance. The thing that truly bothers me about this is that you see them kissing and you forget about Leia. This film actually kind of ruined what Han and Leia had for each other and that sucks because they are one of my favorite fictional couples. In the being Qi'ra was sweet and kind and supported Han and every idea he had, but then three years later, she is snobbish and actually looks down on Han and would treat him like a kid instead of the guy that was trying to SAVE HER.
But besides that the film was great.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
1261,marcelosichonany,The Most Unnecessary Movie of the Star Wars Franchise,2,27 May 2018,"Too many characters (most of them expandable) and a weak plot that doesn't add anything to the franchise. This is ""Solo: A Star Wars Story"".Alden Ehrenreich makes a decent job as Han Solo, but, as expected, he is no Harrison Ford and lacks of charisma and trickery;Dryden Vos (Paul Bettany's character) is an ""okay"" villain. He is not bad, but could be replaced for any character like Jabba, or any other ""Star Wars-Smuggler-Boss"";Enfys Nest (Erin Kellyman) and Qi'ra (Emilia Clarke) are supposed to be strong women that do whatever it takes to get what they need or do what they believe is right, but the script doesn't help them, and they, unfortunently, are forgettable characters;""L3"" is the worst droid of the saga by far. Bad jokes, bad scenes, bad everything. If this character didn't exist, the plot would be basically the same.
Donald Glover's Lando is good, but it would be better if he were more important to the main story;And at least, but not last: Beckett, played by Woody Harrelson, is the best character in the movie. He has more layers than the others (including Solo, Chewie and Lando) and is very important on Han Solo's character buiding.In the end, ""Solo: A Star Wars Story"" is a bad movie, with a bad script, bad character development and an awful cliffhanger.

It is a good movie, a VERY good one if you consider Rogue One, Episode VII and VIII.More than a good movie, it is the FIRST Star Wars we've had so far with the Disney line-up.

1265,hammit,"Better than The Last Jedi, but still flawed",6,25 May 2018,"I just got back from seeing this film on opening night. After being extremely let down with ""The Last Jedi"" I lowered my expectations for this movie. With that being said, the movie was OK, I'd even say it was GOOD, but not great. The positives: the cast was pretty good, I especially enjoyed Emilia Clarke's and Woody Harrelson's performances. Donald Glover's was OK, but not as great and as hyped as the media built it up to be. Negatives: Disney's continuation of pushing their political agenda at the expense of the story. I felt like L3-37's story arch was forced, similar to the Canto Bight storyline in ""The Last Jedi."" The character had a few funny moments, but was way too in your face with the whole SJW stuff. Also, at times, well most of the time throughout the movie, I just couldn't picture Alden Ehrenreich as Han Solo. This was mainly due to his look and voice. He wasn't horrible, but he didn't really impress either. This may seem like something minor, but I thought the other Wookies in the movie looked weird...one of them reminded me of the Jack Link's Beef Jerky Sasquatch...it was just weird looking. The prequel trilogy Wookies looked better. Overall, I enjoyed the movie more than I did ""The Last Jedi"" and it was decent. I wouldn't pay to see it twice, but I'd probably watch it a second time if it was on Netflix or in Redbox. I still think Disney needs to put someone like Dave Filoni in charge of Lucasfilm, similar to Kevin Feige's role with Marvel Studios.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

1267,TylerWebb19,An exciting adventure within the Star Wars universe,8,29 May 2018,"When I first heard about this subject (Han Solo's backstory) becoming a movie I thought, why? It was most likely for Disney to get some money back after buying the rights to Star Wars but still, why chose Han for a movie? We already knew how he got his ship and what not and making a movie with Han Solo and not casting Harrison Ford to play him is a big risk. I understand they needed a younger actor to portray young Han Solo but still, Fans wouldn't like Seeing Han on the big screen to only remember Harrison Ford isn't apart of the movie!With that being said, this movie is a fun adventure within the Star Wars universe and contains some great action scenes, emotional moments and some funny lines. About the characters, I liked Alden Ehrenreich as Han Solo more than I thought I would. Obviously he doesn't surpass Harrison Ford's incredible work but none the less, Alden's not bad. Emilia Clarke's Qi'ra is a good character, however she becomes more interesting near the end of the movie (without me having to spoil anything) but the movie ends at that point. Beckett is interesting and I thought he was a good addition to the movie and Chewie, this is probably the movie where the furry beast is best in. He feels like a true supporting character and not just Han's sidekick. The story of the movie has a good flow with out any other side plots going on at the same time (unlike The Last Jedi). It felt logical and the plot was put together well. All in all the movie was better than I expected it to be and it's probably getting a little too much hate. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion but this movie is better than people are making it out to be. As a Star Wars fan that has seen every Star Wars movie to date, I can safely say I enjoyed this movie a lot.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

The cast was great, and the story was so cool, packed with action and drama, and turnings, I totally enjoyed it.

I was very pleasantly surprised. Not only was the story very good and told fantastically, but Ehrenreich completely stole the show (its surprising in itself to have to say the lead ""stole the show"" but in this case he had to due to the anticipation for Donald Glover's Lando Calrissian). He captured Han Solo better than I bet even he thought he was capable of. The ending I find weak, as Lucasfilm and Ron Howard give viewers a huge reveal, and only to just end the movie and leave little to no plot resolution. I give this movie 7.5/10 stars, but due to the rating system on his website I rounded up to 8. Definitely go see this in theaters, real fans will not regret it.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

Episode VIII really sucked. It really did, don't deny it.This movie saves Star Wars. Take all the ""Disney ruined Star Wars"" stuff and toss it away. This movie is good. Maybe not like inception good, but like Indiana Jones good.The scrappy kid we all know and love is portrayed beautifully by Alden Ehrenreich. Chewbacca is amazing, as is Lando Calrissian.(For the dads reading this and don't know much about Star Wars, but have crazy kids who do, those are very important characters)Remember at the end of Rogue One, where Princess Leia is handed the plans to the Death Star, kicking off the trilogy? Remember how great that action sequence was? Remember all badass Darth Vader? Do you, do you? It's not in Solo.I mean there are lots of connections that tells you whether it takes place after Rogue One or before, and, not a spoiler, it's before.From the name drop of the planet Scarif to Han heading to Tatooine, they do it well.This movie is good, smart, really funny, and is completely unexpected. (psssst. really awesome action sequences happen).I give it a 9/10 because Star Wars really needed to get their stuff together after how terrible Episode VIII was and they did a fantastic job at it. Some points are predictable, things happen in a similar way to how it happened in Rogue One. They also could've added a little cool transition point that leads directly into the next movie in the timeline (not that they didn't, just saying it could've been done a bit better). Which is why I give it a 9/10.Just go watch the movie what are you doing.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

Everything was extremely predictable and the only things that were unpredictable were the ones that defied physics so much that you would have no chance to expect them. Also every joke falls flat, the robosexuality is just lame, robots asking for equal rights is just embarrassing and the plot twists were so obvious that they did not work at all.It's less anger inducing than ep 7 and 8, but it's objectively a really bad movie and a boring time to spend.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

1280,mistermclazo,"""Solo: A Star Wars Story"" - A Bittersweet Look at an Awesome Story",5,25 June 2018,"Solo is fine. It's not offensive, but it really can't be enjoyed like other films. It really is said best by so many other people: This is the least I've ever cared about a Star Wars film. It has good things, and a lot of bad things, but mainly just bland things. It has forced emotional moments, strangely placed visuals, and out-of-place segments that just make it feel a bit unfinished. Many characters are annoying, many more are predictable, and even more are bland and lazy. I love Star Wars, and Han Solo especially, but not like this.Now, as much as I hate to say it, Star Wars has been at somewhat of a low point. Maybe not in the Box Office, but to the fans and critical reception. Solo does not break that trend. So much about this movie doesn't make sense (even considering the drama over directors and the creative process). Characters like L3, Beckett and even Solo himself were either predictable or annoying (I really disliked L3, just saying). The other characters were good, and even had some clever twists in their character arcs. But even they couldn't save this film from some major problems.Alden Ehrenreich did a good job portraying the Solo he was in the movie, not the actual Han Solo. Woody Harrelson did an awesome and wonderful job playing his character, even if that character had a few flaws. Emilia Clarke was great and entertaining, and Joonas Suotamo was great and deserving of his role. But let us not forget the star attraction: Donald Glover. He plays Lando like a god. He was just great and awesome. Other good performances include that of Thandie Newton, Phoebe Waller-Bridge, Paul Bettany and Erin Kellyman.There were things I did like a lot, surprisingly. The graphics were decent. Sometimes they were PS2 graphics, and sometimes they were like real life. The twists at the end were great, and the humor was family friendly and yet still good.Mainly, what I'm trying to say is that Disney could do better. Just because Han Solo is your lead doesn't exclude you from making a film. See it if you want family friendly mediocrity. 5 out of 10!",Solo - A Star Wars Story
1281,sdumistracel,"So, why is this movie getting a lot of negative reviews?",10,26 May 2018,"First of all, I am not being objective when I am giving this movie 10/10. If I have to though, the movie is a solid 8.5. Han Solo is one of my favourite movie heroes so from there comes the high rating. The actor portraying Han Solo was amazing. I was one of those people who was neither mad nor in awe when he was casted. He certainly did his job. It really felt like he was playing Han Solo, nothing felt forced. Donald Glover, as always, shined as Lando. The droid was hilarious. Emilia Clarke's character was a bit insufferable at times but whatever, the Darth Maul cameo was cool so there's that.Now the story: I have to say it made sense for Han Solo's character. We basically find out about the things he mentioned during the Original Trilogy: how he met Chewie, how he won the Millennium Falcon and met Lando, how he made the Kessel run etc etc. Again, it made sense.So did this movie really need to happen? Not necessarily, but for what it turned out to be I think it's worth a watch.

1282,JosephD3193,A Pointless Star Wars Spin-Off of one of the Saga's Greatest Characters,7,4 June 2018,"WARNING: SPOILERS!!!I didn't have high exprectations going into the movie and came out getting exactly what I expected. Solo: A Star Wars Story is full of up and downs, doesn't impress by any means and gives a mediocare story filled with a handful of forgettable scenes and sub plots. Let me start off with what I liked. The beginning (first 15-20 minutes or so) of the film actually gave me a promising first impression. I was impressed with the opening dialogue and thought the tone of the film, gloomy and a feel of being confined (under the Empire in this case), was the best choice they could've gone with and I was a fan of it. I felt like I was a person in Han's situation. I understood why they were defecting and wanted to escape. The humor was worth a few chuckles and the chemistry between Alden Ehrenreich (Han) and Emilia Clarke (Qi'ra) was very believable. The writers gave me enough to be invested with Han and Qi'ra's relationship (which was impressive since they managed to do that in only 10 minutes) and Han's reaction when he was separated from her was very appropriate and at this moment, his motive for the film became as clear as day and it was a good introduction. The film then skips three years as it shows Han fighting for the Empire, as a way to get back to Qi'ra. Han later encounters a man named Tobias Beckett who is working as an undercover Captain for the Empire, carrying out a job for his criminal group, Crimson Dawn. Han wants to join them but they capture him, because he knows about their job, and throw him a cell where one of the top three scenes in the movie in my opinion takes place. Han is sent down there to be eaten by some monster who is released to be the one and only Chewbacca. This scene is jampacked with great fighting between the two. But what really stood out about this scene was how Chewie was introduced. They show different aspects of his body before really revealing him, as he comes out of the shadows. This includes a nice shot of his food stepping into mud which, along with the other shots of his introduction, portray him as a monster like everyone else's sees him as. This is a nice contrast because he is shown to the audience as a terrifying creature, like how the rest of the people in the movie see him as, even though we know him as a loveable best friend to Han. Although, they manage to change our perspective of him for a couple minutes, which I thought was a really good job on their part. Han ultimately convinces Chewie that he will help him escape, which they eventually do. Chewie is grateful and him and Han become memebers of Tobias's crew. However, the film begins to have a decline from here on out. Crimson Dawn's first job with Han and Chewie takes place on a western-style train chase. This scene is most likely the most entertaining and exhilarating part of the movie, which, however, does not say much down the line. Tobias's love interest, Val, is killed on their job, and the audience is expected to feel bad for her/Tobias. But... I didn't really care about her or her relationship. However, I really would've liked to have cared. I just don't understand the point of killing her off. It doesn't effect anything down the line and it felt like a situation where the actress didn't feel like doing the movie anymore so they just killed her to avoid a problem. I would've liked to see what her character was like, which seemed to me as a much more likeable and laid back version of Tobias. It just felt very unnecessary and Tobias quickly gets over it (which does make some sense, however, since he just failed a big job which may result in his death). This eventually leads into a scene where Han, Chewie, and Tobias go to meet their boss, Dryden Vos. In this part of the movie, we see Han knock into, who else but Qi'ra, who works where their boss does his business with his employees. This was a very low point in the movie for me as in how the filmmakers handled it. Qi'ra playfully taps him on the shoulder and Han is excited(?). You would think her face would widen with a smile and she'd run up to him yelling, ""Han! Han! Oh my god!"" But no. Their interaction is very, very played down and extremely nonchalant. I would think Han would completely forget about what was going on and get lost in the moment. I mean for God's sake! He enrolled in the goddamn Empire and fought in extremely dangerous battles/war with near death experiences... for three years!! Don't you think Han would just bail on his crew and leave with her? Well.. not that.. but something under that circumstance? I mean he dedicated the last three years of his life solely to get Qi'ra back! And he reacts to seeing her as if it's been a couple months or so. This was just such a crucial and important scene to the story and it was important for them to get it right, which I think they didn't. The introduction of Lando is one of the things this film did pretty well. This character is nearly as important to get right as Han's. And I think the casting choice was perfect. Donald Glover gives a really excellent performance that did not feel forced at any point in the movie. This also goes for my thoughts on Alden Ehrenreich's version of Han. He really exceeded people's expectations which were really unfair in the first place. I thought he was going to do alright and he came out capturing the essence of Ford's Solo in a pretty good sense. I really like how they added in Lando cheating at gambling/games becuase that's the kind of character he is. Slick. When he is gambling with Han, the banter is really shown in a great way. Their interactions are as good as it gets in this film. But of course there had to be an awful sidekick, L3... This character... just really landed on its head off of a 40-foot building for me. Didn't work at all in my opinion. Not a bit. The ""love connection"" between her and Lando is as believable as two dogs giving birth to a cat. Or in other words.. nonexistent. When she dies (which I cheered at), I actually did feel some sympathy for Lando becuase L3 was one of Lando's only real friends. She wasn't a co-worker, boss, or employee, but one of Lando's (as well as we know) only real thing he has with him all the time. But again, I still couldn't connect or care about her death at all. The love chemistry between them still failed. At this point in the movie, the Kessel Run is taking place. Now, everybody was excited for this. And my thoughts on it... it was really, really boring as hell. I honestly can't remember much or tell you what even happened or who said what to who during these 15-20 something minutes this was going on. It was just so dull and.. well, boring is really the only way I know how to explain it. Oh yeah, and did you see what I said before. It was around 15 or 20 minutes long. That's right, this sub plot is way too prolonged and stretched out that I nearly closed my eyes of tiredness, which never happens to me. Truthfully, they could've done this in five minutes. Maybe not the absolute worst aspect of the film, but definitely in my top 3 low points of the movie in my opinion. Really dragged out.Earlier in the film, where Han reacquaints with Qi'ra, we meet Dryden Vos. It really seemed like Paul Betteny was giving his all for this character and he was a really good part of the movie, despite his very short time on screen.Tobias eventually betrays Han, which was very predictable (I honestly thought he was going to betray him before even seeing Solo), but that may have been the point, as Han points out. This is one of my favorite parts of the movie becuase it shows the side of Han that we all know. He knew that Tobias was going to betray him and it made sense that after Tobias goes back on Han's side, just because he has what he wanted, that Han shoots and kills him because Han doesn't take that bullsh*t. These are the parts of the movie I wanted to see more of. The side of Han we all know. But they did well with what they gave in those terms. I didn't even mention that group that they were fighting with on the trains in the beginning who they ultimately befriend, but they were also sort of pointless besides helping them at the end. I didn't really need to know much more about them or their leader. But that cameo at the end... Ohhhh boy. Let me tell you about how awesome it was seeing Maul in the theater. Even though it lasted less than two minutes, it was so cool seeing how he was behind the whole scheme of things revolving around Vos's business. I'm a big, big fan of Maul, mostly because his appearances in The Clone Wars and Star Wars Rebels are some of the best parts of those shows. I'm also glad they utilized Sam Witwer's voice because, well, it's just so menacing.Overall, I can see myself rewatching Solo once at the most, but it's in no way anything special. You can pick a few good things out of it which make it more enjoyable and it's not really that bad. The story wraps up as a complete begging to end story, but I wish some elements could've been added or changed to make the story more energentic and overall better.RATING: 6.5/10",Solo - A Star Wars Story

1284,Levention46,Awesome Sleeper! Must See!,8,7 August 2020,"Had not even heard of this movie until a few weeks ago after finally getting caught up on the first six episodes of the Star Wars franchise. My nine-year-old precocious boy recommended seeing this movie. I didn't even know it existed.Fortunately we were able to boost Disney+ (Jk!), and watch it! I have to say it was really a fantastic movie with exceptional performances by actors and actresses such as Childish Gambino, Amelia Clark, Thandie Newton, Woody Harrelson, and the relatively unknown Alden Ehrenreich.Plot development folded together nicely consistent to the franchise and in recognition Of Ron Howard's directorial genius. Exciting exciting scenes of conflict, action and fairly decent dialogue kept the viewer wanting to see more - especially the plot twists that took place all throughout the movie.This movie was definitely worth watching and I'm absolutely flabbergasted it didn't It didn't garner far more attention, and better reviews.

After all, how could anyone try to hold a candle to the sheer charisma of Harrison Ford as Han Solo? Besides, the trailers left me feeling rather lukewarm.Suffice it to say that I was completely startled (in a great way) by how good of a movie it was.I mean, sure, it wasn't revolutionary in the history of filmmaking, but it was engaging and enjoyable. The plot was pretty well done and the worldbuilding was very intriguing to watch, not to mention the visuals. Alden Ehrenreich did a pretty good job of capturing how I would have imagined young Han Solo to behave, something I wasn't expecting. Certainly better than what I was expecting.I'd advise going to see it. It's not Empire Strikes Back, but it is a very enjoyable and very engaging heist story that I think viewers will enjoy.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

They had me guessing which character to love or hate the entire time. I felt guilty when I guessed wrong then turned out to be right. I was also guessing which characters were gonna die the entire time. I loved the many twists and turns. It even got me guessing how Han was supposed to win the Falcon. It's terrific. The Chewie reveal was hilarious and well done. It was great seeing the origins of the famous Kessel run. Donald Glover was perfect as Lando. Overall, the movie was just a perfect little package. It had all the right ingredients to entertain. Makes me wish there was more Solo movies. I really want to see what their next adventure is all about.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

The beginning was good, the middle was ok, but the end was so confusing. I had trouble confirming the villain. First, I thought it was Enfys Nest, then I thought it was Dryden Vos, then thought it was Enfys, then went back to Dryden. Then for some reason thought it was Beckett, then switched back to Dryden. I figured out that it was Dryden at the end, but was still incredibly confused. After Dryden died and Qi'Ra took the ship to Darth Maul (By the way, why did they bring him into this. It just seemed irrelevant), I thought she would become evil. Also, when Han killed Beckett, he was sad. If he would become sad, why did he kill him? Also, we have to talk about kissing in this movie. First of all, I know Han is one with the ladies but still, there were 8 kisses in this movie. There were already three in the first 15 minutes. I was starting to think this was a romance movie. I also found it weird that Lando was attractided to L3-37. But there were some good things too. I loved L3's sense of humor. She was hilarious. I also enjoyed Rio Durant. I was sad when he died though. I liked the relationship between Han and Qi'Ra. I liked that we learned new things about Han, like how he was in the Empire, which is how he met Chewy. I liked the friendship between Han and Chewy and how they grew closer. So the movie was good, it just left me confused. It had so much potential. It just never met up to it.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
1292,SomeOtherBloke,"It's better than the sequels, but cheesier than Rogue One",6,1 January 2019,"I watched Solo recently. I didn't expect it to be very good. But actually, it is alright.The first act is really cheesy and lame, but it actually picks up and is quite watchable.Is it really Han Solo's source story?
Hmmm...
A bit. Sort of, but not quite. It's a kind of like a ""version"" of perhaps some of Han's past, but over dramaticised, sanitised and cherry picked. That's the feeling I got from it.
Still, I actually didn't mind it. It's more fun than I expected.Only the chase at the beginning and the ridiculous ""why are you just standing there?"" spice mine shoot-out annoyed me and took me out of the movie.
The characters are also a bit too ""of Earth"" rather than from a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away.
The space monster is actually much more tolerable than that dumb meteor worm in the ESB, too. Which was a pleasant surprise.Personally, I thought they handled the sabaac game much better than I had dreaded. I had often contemplated that when I was growing up. Han was still a touch too goody, goody two shoes for me there though. Just a touch.However, there is a kind of atmospheric grittiness that SW and ESB had that is missing, which RO had a little more of. Though this Han movie does have a bit.I liked the singing alien though Lol! That was pretty alien and star warsy for me. It beats the ROTJ singers, but the SW canteen band still reigns supreme Lol.Chewie was good and isn't a vegan. Their meeting was fun. But, the implication that Chewie fancies Han a little and expressed jealousy was kind of an odd moment.The pirate reveal was a ""tut"" moment. Kind of cheesy like Mad Max 3, when you really just want Mad Max or Mad Max 2, kind of thing. Toe Cutter and Humongous pee all over those ""pirates"", lol.As a movie, it was alright. But you need to watch Aquaman to get a little some of that amazement feeling back, I think. Though, the first 10 minutes of the first Mad Max movie will also do the trick, lol.But, if you are bored and you like Star Wars and the TV show ""Firefly"", you will enjoy this movie. A bit daft, but it's good enough to watch. There are worse movies out there.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
1293,gypsyhansolothepolishpavlova,A visually stunning fun Star Wars film.,7,4 July 2018,"Alot of controversy surrounded this movie from the start , from it's casting choices , to it's general idea , to it's directors leaving , and so on. And i have to admit i did not think they could pull this movie off. I too went into the cinema thinking that a moive could never show us a different side of a character we've known for 41 years now , especially not with a new actor.But i watched the movie with low expectations ( twice ) , and i have to say: its Fun. How do i put this , Solo meets all adequacies in an expected Star Wars movie , and exceeds in some. But most of the time , its really just a fun heist movie with Han. The movie also hows us new locations and new interesting characters , such as the Crimson Dawn , a gang of evil space .... gangsters. As for Alden Ehrenreich's performance as Han , i thought he was good. He made a good Han. For about 7/8 of the movie he's more of a niaive version of the Han we've come to know , but at the movie's very end is where he's at his most Han-like.Although the movie is about Han Solo , the real scene stealers are Childish Gamb- sorry , Donald Glover's Lando Calrissian , and new comer Qi'ra ( played by Game of Thrones' Emilia Clarke. ) Lando was funny , sassy , badass and dressed flamboyantly. He really brought a certain level of swag to every scene he's in. As for Qi'ra , she was a very interesting and mysterious character. She's so cool , and cold blooded that i genuinley would pay money to see a movie continuing her story ( especially with what happened at the end with *SPOILER* , that was crazy ). And like i said , this movie is visually stunning , infact it's the most authentic and good looking Star Wars movie since 2016's Rogue One. Solo also very evidently has strong Western Cinematography ( you know , like a Fistful of dollars and all that. ) , and that really contributes to the lighting , tone and over all look of the Millenium Falcon , Kessel Run and Dryden Vos's Yacht.So those are my thoughts on the movie , but don't take my opinion for it , go see it yourself! I would recommend this movie , depending on what mood you're in.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

1296,VeggieWindu,Best Star Wars Title Produced By The Mouse House,8,24 May 2018,"For the first time since Disney bought Star Wars we finally get a film which expands the Star Wars universe in a positive way. We get characters one can empathize with making very human decisions in a very dark world, whilst progressing a plot with initiatives on the grey side of morality. It's fun. It's exciting. It's Star Wars.Alden Ehrenreich plays the young Han Solo in a fun way and he really makes you sympathize with his struggles. The film paints a picture of why Han Solo is who he is as you slowly see him being formed by the world around him into the character we know. We see a dark and gritty galaxy in which the Empire reigns supreme and crime and civic unrest are on the rise. It's no wonder stormtroopers develop their sarcastic war humor to keep a sense of optimism after the dark things they have to do. The rest of the cast is great as well. All the characters were full of life and their actions were very human. Nothing like the dull and lifeless stereotypes we see in Rogue One. Chewie is fun. Qi'ra is mysterious. Lando is... Lando. It all just works. Every character has a distinct personality and the bad guys' motives aren't black and white. This results in unpredictable plot twists and at the end of the movie you might find yourself rooting for completely different people than before.The cinematography could have been better to give use a better overview of different situations, and I would have loved to have seen more technologically advanced settings in the vision of George Lucas instead of the natural wastelands Disney likes to show.

It never used to be like that. For example, I'm not a Star Wars fan but just happened to have seen many of them just because I like watching films and this one is right up there at the top. That's an objective and unbiased fact. The point being is that there is no possible way that a film like this could genuinely attract so many 1/10 and 2/10 scores unless there was some deliberate plan to flood the IMDB ratings systems in such a way as to skew the overall results. But why? Are people getting paid to submit false low score reviews and if so paid by who? And for what reason?

I avoided it in the theatre after The Last Jedi was such a disappointment (and for what it's worth, I tried again and had to turn it off - it really is a bad movie.). So I watched tonight. What a delightful film. I can see how others might have thought the Beckett and Paul Bettany's character were a little undeveloped, but you can clearly see how Han becomes the character we know and love. The end is a perfect setup for his impending cynicism. The story arc was completely entertaining and I had no idea how it was finally going to end. I am actually very interested to see what would happen next. There were characters I thought wouldn't make it that did. There's so much that has me wanting more. Acting was solid if not excellent. I put this right next to Rogue One as a film better than each of TFA and TLJ. I officially now have greater interest in the spinoffs than the continuation of the main story. I'll skip episode 9 but gladly buy tix to the next ""Star Wars story"" film. And the backstory in Han and Chewie's relationship has so much to it. 1?!? Are you nuts?

Because a flirtatious navicomputer calculated the path for him.Why does he have a particular swagger? Because he's trying to emulate his mentor, a very bored and there for the cash Woody Harrelson.Even his relationship with Chewy, this film manages to ruin. Han apparently speaks wookie now. Yeah. That's how far this film goes to destroy your love for the series most loved character.It completely takes away all agency Harrison Ford gave him. It's a travesty of a film.

1307,adragon82,Another nail in the coffin,3,26 May 2018,"I keep asking myself this question over and over again. What makes a good movie and how should I rate them? And each time the answer is the same.1. Acting. In Solo, the acting is subpar by all but the droids. It would seem the main stars watched the original films to try to get the mannerisms down and that is about it. 4 out of 10. Admittedly, this score would be higher if the actors were not saddled with a terrible script that, once again relies heavily on viewers having seen the previous films. For anyone that has not seem the previous films, they are left wondering why characters keep giving ""knowing looks"" whenever certain things are said. Outside of that, no one performed in a way that stood out.2. Script. In Solo, Star Wars was always about two things. Action. Excitement. And that is what the stories were built around. Any dialog, speeches were just to setup action and excitement. Two things we got very little of in Solo. The action and excitement were low, spread out and in-between horrible dialog and character setup. The plot-line was overly simplistic and safe, once again relying heavily on fans knowing things a few too many times, giving that smile and nod and never taking any actual chances to bring us something we have not seen before so many other times. Script 2 out of 103. Character development. Star Wars fans are once again treated to what amounts to be a poorly written fan fiction that appears to be penned by a person who had a political/social idea first, and wrote a script around those ideas. At no point, in any of the 11 previous Star Wars movies did anyone ask or CARE about a characters sex or sexual habits. Not...once. And why is this? Because Star Wars is not a romance, porn and basically anything sexual related at all..and because even Solo is not one of those things the entire topic stuck out like a sore thumb and is one of many things that did nothing to support the story or develop an emotional connection of the character to the viewer. At no point, does Lando generate the strong feelings like in ESB where you find he had great responsibility and no power to protect his city filled with people and the same can be said about each other character. Development 3 out of 10 and only that high due to pre-existing characters.4. Enjoyableness. Clearly, a thing that is highly personal to the individual. For me, there was so little enjoyment that I had to force myself not to leave during the film. The action was spread thin. The plot arc was overly simple and relied too heavily on ""Hey this is Star Wars!"" that it at times was near painful because you can tell it was done in a way the makers felt was ""safe"" and safe...is not FUN as it creates a story that doesnt take chances and ends up being something we have seen before, and at times in the films, seen MANY times before. Enjoyableness 2 out of 10.Overall, this movie brought zero that was original or seemed original with an unimaginative story with characters that were very weak in the development department that, in the end, meant little to the viewer and was a little too similar to B rated Sci-Fi one can find on cable channels like Syfy.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

1309,leonjulian,A underrated movie which had to pay for TLJ,8,11 December 2019,"Visual 4/5
Sound 4/5
Story 3/5
Cast 5/5
Nostalgia 2/5Visual 4/5
I think Solo Story did a good job in terms of the visual design. I mean there is nothing as gorgeous like Coruscant or Canto Bight but they still managed to underline theit story with a good screenplay and nice special effects. The war scene of Han fighting for the empire and the kessel run really are adding up here.Sound 4/5
In terms of sound its pretty much the same as for the visuals. There is nothing that makes you say wow like the seismic bombs in episode 2 or the lack of sound after the destruction of the supremacy in TLJ but theres is also nothing to brag about. The soundtrack is neat and adds fragments of the original soundtracks in some places and the overall sounddesign is really good.Story 3/5
The backstory of Han is well explained and makes sense. Also scenes like the Kessel Run are pretty amazing. But thats pretty much it. To be honest no one asked for a backstory of Han and still it feels a bit weak that he gets his legendary second name from the imperial recruitment agency or that we dont get to know why he is in conflict with the hutts. Still we get to see how he got the Millenium Falcon, his blaster and how he got to meet Chewie. So while the Story feels uninspired and weak at some spots it still delivers in terms of fan service and at least its narrated with tension. So overall a 3/5 should be the right rating.Cast
The cast is the best part of this movie. In my Opinion Alden Ehrenreich does a good job of imitating Harrison Ford. And the cast for the supporting roles is just awesome. Emilia Clarke as Qi'ra, Woody Harrelson as Beckett and Paul Bettany as a real opponent. I think if Donald Glover plays the worst out of the whole cast (except L3-37 but we wont talk about that droid) you have bigger problems than your actors.Nostalgia 2/5

Since Han Solo is one of my favorite character in Star Wars.
Yet, it is not the Han Solo.Charm and natural cool guy like Harrison Ford brought Han Solo character to life. There is probably no other actor today can again revive the expectation from the viewer.If you do not have an actor who can fit into the character that has been successful for many years, then what is the point of making a story out of the character?Since it is about ""Solo"" I wanted to watch Han Solo whom I have known for years.

But more importantly, it felt like a SW movie, the atmosphere and everything. it just felt authentic. And the CGI was really low-key, most of the sets looked real, it's great.The lead actor is a perfect Solo, he even looks like young Ford, it's almost creepy.

I really liked Solo I enjoyed the story and could see it going in some really exciting directions great acting effects and characters MUCH BETTER than in TLJ.
The backlash for TLJ has ruined fan togetherness which also effect my love for Star Wars Solo has gone a long way to mending my feelings i neeeeed to see a follow up to Solo i think it would be up there with Rogue one on this one occasion I hope Disney stick to there guns and do a follow up.

1323,gs12-1,Great movie with 80s vibes,10,10 June 2018,"I almost didn't watch the movie, because of some trolls and bad reviews. Just to say that I gave ""The Last Jedi"" a 5 out of 10 rating, so I am not just a blind fanboy, who likes everything Star Wars. 
The movie starts a bid childish, even the ""evil"" characters are not as evil as they can be. Maybe that's my main concern with the direction the franchise is heading - it is becoming too predictable and too much a family style movie. It can definitely be a bit more darker and mature, without harming the overall Star Wars feeling.
Apart from that, Solo is a great movie, very fresh and entertaining. It has this 80s Indiana Jones and old school movies spirit in it.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
1324,poopville,A non-hateful Star Wars fan who liked it,7,6 August 2018,"So I am of the generation who got to experience Star Wars feom the beginning. Standing in a crazy ling line, literally wrapped around the local theater back in 1977 as a kid. Totally unaware I was about to see a movie that would become my central interest for all my childhood, early teens and once again as an adult. And all these years later, able to share this fandom with my own son. 
I liked Solo. I wouldn't say it's my favorite but it was a fun ride and it evoked the feelings that I associate with Stat Wars. The world and characters felt right. It showed us some cool new things about life in that world, living under the Empire. The amazing cityscapes of Corellia... It felt similar to me to Rogue One. Modern filmmaking techniques yet convincingly evoking the vibes of the classic Star Wars world. 
Anyway, I just wanted to put in some positive review for this movie to contrast this strange wave of hate feom ""fans"" on here. I don't really understand it. I have liked something about every Star Wars movie there has been. Some are better than others. There are weaker moments in every one to be sure. But none are worth the irrational seeming hate some people are putting out there.
Solo is good and worth your time if you like Star Wars. Just one fan's opinion.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
1325,torka858,Very Cringey,6,25 May 2018,"The movie was written very poorly. The opening scenes were pointless and ""action packed"". Plot points of Han Solo's origin (pre-Disney and post-Disney canon) were absolutely butchered.As the movie progressed it was very clear that Alden Ehrenreich couldn't act, couldn't act like Han Solo, Couldn't deliver a line without grinning and squinting, and that the plot only vaguely aligned for most of the movie, especially crumbling near the end.The entire movie equated to ""summer blockbuster"" story/action scenes, set in a Star Wars universe, only identifiable by a Wookie.Somehow though, through it all, the amazing performances of Woody Harrelson, Emilia Clark, and most importantly Donald Glover, shined through it all and made this movie worth watching.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
1326,KyleH87,The first promising Star Wars side story,9,30 May 2018,"Solo feels a lot more like an actual Star Wars movie than Rogue One ever did, with a seemingly endless universe, fanciful and beguiling characters, and action scenes that are more about the sense of adventure than the action itself.

1327,Alexey_Maximov_King,Some things should be left for audience's imagination.,6,17 June 2018,"Solo: A Star Wars Story is an alright movie on its own, it's a nice, neat space western, but everything in it that's about Star Wars feels forced and calculated. It's like the writers had a checklist with things that had to be in a Han Solo movie: here's the dice, here's how he gets his name, here's how he meets Chewbacca, here's Kessel Run, here's why he shoots first. And they ticked all those points in the list in a most methodical, mechanical way. Lucasfilm decided to go safe with this one, and Ron Howard was the perfect choice for such a job. I've always thought that his movies are dry and riskless, they're not bad, they're a good, solid craftwork that is exactly what you expect it to be. But what makes me wonder is why the studio was willing to go risky with The Last Jedi storytelling, but decided to go the opposite way with Solo. Did Lord and Miller go so far that they scared the producers and made them want to do the movie in the safest possible way? Who knows, but Solo is a movie that we could've easily lived without.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
1328,wheelers-8,Great storytelling and connections to the franchise,9,2 June 2018,I grew up watching Star Wars movies and have always enjoyed the bleed over between movies. Solo was one of the beat recent Star Wars movies I've seen. Hope it becomes its own series. Love the origin story of Chewbacca and Hans Solo. Lots of references to previous Star Wars movies. Ron Howard is a fantastic storyteller and definitely showed his ability and craft with this movie. Donald Glover represented...Billy D Williams would be proud.

You've had these stories planned and played out in your heads, foreseeing every scene for 15 years, so I understand why you've had your share of disappointments. The problem is you don't understand that ROTJ is no different than any of the new movies if you only took your childhood glorification out of it. Granted I can find faults in many of the post OT and many stories I wish went a different direction, but in no way am I going to say any of them destroyed the franchise, including the PT, which I definitely didn't enjoy as a whole. This movie told me almost everything I wanted to know about Solo's past and not for a second am I going to let my fantasy of what I thought it should be like ruin the movie for me.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

It was fun and engaging, and despite not revealing anything fundamental about the sw universe it was likeable.

No idea what its creators wanted besides the obvious (loads of money), there's no storyline, plots are totally illogical bad guys have never seemed so ridiculous as well as good chaps so lame and space hasn't seemed less spacey in any other SW film. Motives of the main characters are fuzzy to say the least.
Main actors are simply bad. Film is way too long. Et cetera, et cetera.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
1335,andrew-kinghorn-82-726732,From a hardcore SW fan,9,25 May 2018,"I would say overall the film was pretty much what I expected. I was not as hyped for the film as I was for Rogue One or the Last Jedi and my girlfriend was clearly the same.I agree with quite a few comments that a film about Han Solo wasn't really needed, but they have delivered a decent enough film that is entertaining and remains faithful to the franchise. This film didn't at all feel forced, which it would have done had they given us Jabba the Hutt (or the Hutt family) and/or Boba Fett, both of whom would have no relevance to the story told had they appeared, even though I went into the movie hoping to see Fett for a few seconds I was not disappointed when I didn't. The only bounty hunter to get any lip service was Bossk, a nice little touch for SW nerds which gave you a little smile. There were actually a few Easter eggs for fans and they were vague enough not to spoil the film if you missed out on them. Now get ready for a SW fan to drive home some truths. If you are an original trilogy super fan then you are truly going to dislike this film and I actually think Star Wars is no longer a franchise for you. I have a real problem with the fans who are like this anyway, to assume the only activities going on in the Galaxy are between the Empire and the Rebels is so naïve and just cringeworthy. What Solo achieves is to broaden fans minds that little bit further, to give fans the reality that there are other lives and plots going on other than the Empire trying to wipe out the Rebels and vice versa. But they then go beyond this, it is no longer just Empire vs Rebellion, the former is only in it briefly and the latter not at all. Because lets be honest, the Rebellion do not care if smugglers are stealing from the Empire, in fact they probably support such action without getting involved. However get ready for the best thing Disney did in this film, they played the smart move here by taking trilogy and prequel content and bringing them together nicely. If you had not seen Star Wars Rebels or Clone Wars episodes then Darth Mauls return was a jaw dropping and exciting ending. Pause to consider that this means the Emperor has an new enemy in Maul who knows the Emperor well, a troubled apprentice in Vader (never really settled as evidenced by ROTJ) and an Obi Wan on exile on Tatooine protecting Luke from the Empire. Now tell me as a Star Wars fan why this doesn't get you excited where Disney takes this. Are we going to see some Vader and Maul light saber action? What is not to like about that exciting prospect.What Solo did was give fans a pretty good film and gave us back one of the villains who pretty much everyone agrees ""should have lasted longer"", well he did. So never assume getting your limbs cut off means it's the end of you, you'd have thought we would have learnt that from Darth Vader and Luke (hand). So don't anyone moan that its unbelievable. It also proves that as had been explained previously, Snoke was elsewhere in the universe hiding, so let the Snoke is (insert villain here) theories go, in the words of Kylo ""its time to let old things die"". Snoke, Maul, Vader, and Emperor were alive after events of Revenge of the Sith. If this doesn't get you excited, nothing will. Is Snokes ""other apprentice"" Darth Maul, let's wait and see...Assume nothing in Star Wars, you are not telling the story and they have proven it is by no means predictable. Go in with no expectation other than to be surprised, do not hope for characters X and a predictable story line. If you want that then you have Marvel.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

If you go in and leave all critical thinking at the door, you might be halfway entertained. You may find yourself wishing George Lucas would start writing the script again.

This movie is not AMAZING, but it is a fun adventure story focused on a beloved character. The action sequences are thrilling, the score is masterfully done, and the performances are great. Some may say it could have a bit more emotional development for its characters, but it definitely gives you enough to stay invested in. My only other flaw with it is that the end finale falls a bit flat in comparison to the other sequences in the film, but it's not a huge issue. There's lots of quality filmmaking and storytelling here. Go and have fun!",Solo - A Star Wars Story
1339,jrclare,The Stand-Alone films are outstanding,9,25 May 2018,"SPOILER: Firstly you need to know how I rate: 6 is watchable, 7 is ""Pretty Good"" plus all Star Wars films get 1 extra Star from me, so consider this an 8 for the average movie goer. Also in the Star Wars context I've given Ep 1&2 a 7, 3 a 9, 4-6 a 10, 7&8 an 8 and Rogue One a 9. 
Now on to the movie - If you don't like this one, then there is no satisfying any too far gone grumpy Star Wars 'fans'. Is it perfect? No. Is it highly entertaining and a fun thrill ride? Yes. I went in with 4 objectives of what I was expecting and it delivered. MINOR spoiler (this information is garnered from the trailers, so I don't consider it a spoiler). 1> Han Meets Chewie, 2> Han Meets Lando, 3> Han gets his hands on The Falcon & 4> We see the Kessel Run completed in under 12 Parsecs. Tick, tick, tick, tick. What I also got was some excellent unexpected parts of the story which I will not divulge here. For the people who think Han is too different in this I will say don't forget, this Han Solo is not wary, jaded or only looking out for himself, because he's still young and naive. This is 10-13 years before A New Hope don't forget (and don't get me started on people that can't deal with the Millennium Falcon being all shiny and new and different colours and shape...).
I'm in my 40's and grown up my whole life with Star Wars and can pick holes in any of them, they can't all be a 10 and please absolutely everyone, so stop worrying so much and enjoy the thrill ride that is Solo. If you're wary of it because you disliked The Last Jedi, don't even go there, go to your nearest cinema and see Solo.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
1340,gilgie74,Dont waste your time and money,5,26 May 2018,"I will say kids would probably like it. This was not a good movie. There was a total lack of effort in the writing process. Very checklist. They came up with a long checklist of things they decided needed to be in the movie, then one weekend, decided to string them all together with a script. Very lazy, like a rough draft that never got refined with many needed rewrites and never waivering from that checklist. Im really disappointed. So much potential. They really need to start giving these projects to writers who care about making a good movie with a good story. There were a couple parts that were somewhat humorous, mostly eye rolling. What are the 3 things a buisness needs to be sucessful, location location location. What are the 3 things TV/movies need, WRITING WRITING WRITING. It all starts with the writing kids.

1341,vanrossi13,Pretty disappointing,5,16 September 2018,"First off I really just do not understand why they didn't get that Anthony guy from Age of Adeline who played the younger Harrison Ford. He did Harrison Ford perfectly in that movie and even looked like him too. Instead the idiots decided to go with Alden whatever-your-name-is who quite frankly SUCKED as Han. Didn't look like him one bit? Check. Didn't sound like him one bit? Check. Didn't even act like him one bit? Check. There were maybe three or four times where I saw slightly what could have MAYBE been a Han sounding moment or line or delivery or smirk, but that's it. The rest of his performance was a disgrace. No wonder they hired a acting coach for him on the set and there so many problems with production. It just didn't really feel like Star Wars. The Darth Maul bit where he turns on his lightsaber for no reason was cringe x1000000. Dialogue with Kira and Han and the other main characters for that matter at times seemed out of place and just stiff. Like bad acting or directing or both. Is it just me? Judging by the reviews I'd say I don't think so. And stop with the young strong ugly girls in these new Star Wars movies trying to be all ""oh look at us we are saying woman power and it's all not about the guys and how strong they are women are strong too"" Jesus Christ it's in every one of the new ones so far and it's too much I'm all for it but you guys are shovin it down our throats like nothing else it's awkward and cringe x509999999999999. It's just a pretty average movie and just not that great and this is coming from a major Star Wars fan OT still is the best by far and always will be with the exception of Rogue One which was just incredible. I'm giving it 5/10 and that's really for the Falcon scenes and the train heist which I think were done well. Also it's sad to see how many fake reviews ther are on here these days to try to bump up the rating to over a 7 so people think it's great. IMDB you should be ashamed of yourself.

While not as good as Rogue One it's way better than TLG and it is a fairly enjoyable film with some good action and humour. It also manages to avoid the over acting featured in TLG which is good, on the other hand I do feel that a little more character development would have been good.

1344,Doct-326-535761,Better then Last Jedi,9,30 May 2018,"I went in to this one not expecting much because of my complete disappointment of The Last Jedi. With my expectations set very low I found that I was pleasantly surprised by this one. We all know Han's backstory but how it actually went down, the details, were fun to watch. Of coarse it makes it hard to surprise the audience when we all know how fast he is going to make the Kessel run, befriend Chewy, or how he becomes the owner of the Millennium Falcon but the fun is in the details. Everyone knew that the Titanic was going to sink in the end but everyone still went to go see it! It was the minutiae that made it fun. The movie takes you through Han's early years where he has to figure out his way of a planet full of thieves and hustlers with his love Emilia Clarke. After they get separated Han starts working on his plan to make wrong, right. He falls in with a group of marauders (lead by Woody H.) so he can make enough money to get his own ship and the stage is set for everything we know of Han Solo to unfold... As far as the acting Ehrenreich did the best that could be expected. It was a cursed role because no one would have been able to carry it like Harrison Ford, sort of like trying to take the role of the Joker after Heath Ledger. Donald Glover was pretty good, and both Clarke and Harrelson were great! Even enjoyed them sneaking Warwick Davis in there.As a long time Star Wars fan I have been pretty disappointed with the new story line they have created but the back story movies they have made (this and Rouge One) have been much better in my opinion. I would rank them both ahead of Force awakens or the Last Stinking Jedi. A good addition to the series. Thanks Ron Howard! Punch Rian Johnson for me when you see him.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

1346,Zooropa_93,Solo: A Star Wars Story - Could Have Been Better,5,9 July 2018,"I have decided to give Solo: A Star Wars Story five stars because it wasn't bad but it definitely wasn't very good. I think that blame lies squarely with Phil Lord and Christopher Miller, who have to be two of the worse directors in Hollywood at this moment in time and why hire these two lame directors because they had a hit with the Lego Movie back in 2014.If Kathleen Kennedy could go back in time, I'm sure she would have hired Ron Howard straight from the word get go. Ron Howard is an accomplished director who has plenty of hit movies under his belt and his pedigree goes back to the late 1970s.The actors who were in this movie were not bad and I would definitely pay money to see a sequel but Lucasfilm would have to do so much better and they knew this when Lord and Miller were sacked in June 2017, the idiots shouldn't have even been allowed anywhere near the Star Wars franchise.So there you have it, Solo: A Star Wars movie isn't bad, the actors are good but the acting could be better, the script could be sharper and the direction is muddled because of Lord and Miller being sacked and Ron Howard coming in with only 8 weeks of shooting left plus re-shoots.

1348,oleksabunyk,With some problems but still nice Star Wars movie.,10,1 June 2018,"SPOILER: While watching trailers of ""Solo. Star Wars Story"" I was like: ""Disney, is it possible that you will force me to hate Star Wars movies?"". Well, they do not succeed in this - I like this movie, but.... Let start with the main problem of the movie, which was seen even before the trailers come out. It is a nice and fun movie about Star Wars universe, but it is a bad movie about Han Solo. The idea to start filming a movie about the greatest smuggler in the galaxy far-far away was bad, just because the character was entirely made by Indiana Joh... Garrison Ford. If I can imagine another actor to play others heroes of the classic trilogy, to imagine somebody other than Ford is impossible. Garrison Ford is Han Solo, even if he or anybody else didn't like it. But in this movie, they just show you Alden Ehrenreich and say that this is Han. No this isn't. Alden becomes a smuggler, friend of Chewbacca and pilot of Millennium Falcon, but he didn't become Han, and maybe nobody will. Someone also criticizes Alden for bad playing, but I watch Solo dubbed and Ukrainian cast was really good.Even if we forget about Ford, Alden still lacks sarcastic look at the world, and it is noticeable. Well someone (I in my discussions with myself) may say that Han will lose his naivety and become more callous after the movie events, but hey, he grows up in bottoms of the world, about what naivety you can possibly talk. So yes, it is not Han, but still, it is the decent character.Others actors and characters are so-so. Chewbacca is still old good Wookie, who fights, speaks and just is a friend, he looks just gorgeous, one minus that he believed Han too easily. Qi'ra - well Emilia Clarke is not so good actress to grow out of Khaleesi, and this movie is no exception. Lando Calrissian - hit the spot just right, you can praise Donald Clover for that. Beckett (smuggler and Han's sensei) - also is good, maybe more Han-ish than Han in this movie. Main villain - not bad, but not good either, what his name was again? But in this bunch of not-so-bad heroes greate evil exist - L3! It almost like Jar-Jar but droid and with an aftertaste of SJW in an offensive to everybody way. She was added just for comic effect, in the team where almost everyone is comic himself, and that's why she looks so artificial and outplaced. All fauna in this movie looks great, extraterrestrials are good, and this creates a star-wars feeling. Also, nice locations, outskirts of galaxy and cantines with ""decent"" folks. But not only old revised things are good in this movie, the unexpected scene with the battle on the distant planet looks new but still good, space travel in a gas tunnel - it wasn't so in previous movies. So, by the look it still Star Wars. Now about the story. It is interesting. Train robbery, stealing the fuel from the mines and classic cowboy clash at the end, I enjoy it all. But there is no significance for main saga story, as it was in Rogue One. Nothing new and important we do not find out. We already knew that Han was served in imperial troops, that he is the smuggler and that he won Millennium Falcon in the card game. Homeworld of Han and his first love - well it is new, but also unimportant. And the one thing that was important and new - first meeting of Han and Chewbacca - was so lame, for such fateful event. One more bad thing - the ending, and the sith demonstration without any reason for this, except the fact that it will have a sequel. I want something more than just sith with the red lightsaber.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
1349,volfanalum,Appreciate what it is; an enjoyable entry into the saga.,7,29 May 2018,"It's clearly not the best and certainly not the worst entry into the Star Wars saga; but it holds a decent place somewhere in the line. People that grew up watching Star Wars in theatres have the enviable task of deciding where movies like this work into the fabric of the saga. It's not easy. It's hard. We have high standards and we always walk away disappointed. So, we lower the bar. And in that realm, Solo is a decent movie that carries a so/so story about as far as you can. But, the real result here is to give you a little backstory into the man. The smuggler. The scoundrel. It's watchable entertainment. It has pieces you'll recognize and things that will surprise you.

1352,droideka75,"Much, much better than expected.",9,28 May 2018,"So, I went in with some low expectations, the trailers were ok, the troubled production didn't inspire great confidence and i didn't like the casting of Han Solo.Boy was I wrong... this was an enjoyable, gun-slinging, train robbery, double and triple cross type of movie, where Han Solo fits like a glove. Or should i say Glover? glover is Lando. No questions asked, womanizer, charming, the inflection of his voice is pitch perfect. Han Solo not so, but after the first 15 minutes your brain adjusts just fine and you see the rogue you love even if the face is not the same.Now to the great stuff: Chewbacca is the standout. He is truly the big standout. He does more in this movie than in all the Saga movies put together. He flies, he Rips arms off (finnally!!!!), he is the soul of the movie. really great to see Chewie in all his glory. If not for anything else it's a joy to see the big walking carpet being the big walking carpet that we just ear in tales, here we get to see how he got the reputation. (and Lando and Han)Now, some could argue that this was unnecessary and they would be right! But damn if it isn't a blast seeing the Kessel run, The winning of the Falcon, and the events that ultimately lead Han to become the not so idealistic rogue we see later on.Double crossed by his mentor, triple crossed by his love interest, he learned a few lessons here. And the idealistic youg boy we see at the beggining turns into the guy that shoots first asks answers later we love.So, was it necessary? No Is it Fun? Hell Yeah!!!!! And what more can you ask about a space western set in Star Wars universe?Also Darth Maul and the connectivity to Rebels and Clone Wars!!!!! What a great and unexpected surprise, it shows they are really into the ""new Expanded"" universe that we always just dream, even in movies like avengers where the TV Shows are a side note. I truly hope they don't get bummed out by the low numbers and give SOLO 2\Lando a shot, cause I really would love to see what happens to Qi'ra and Darth Maul at dathomir. boy if someone said to me one day i would see a robot legged Maul speaking about dathomir in a movie, i would say no way jose, now anything is possible!!

1359,garcia-roger,A good origin story in line with the Star Wars saga,8,5 June 2018,"PROS:
As far as origin stories go driven by character and a larger universe Solo delivers on all accounts. This is not an action movie. Through the plot you can see strong influence of the original Lucas formula and it works.CONS:
In my opinion the only drawback in the movie is the first act in which Alden seems to have a tough time finding his footing and owning the character. I known he has big shoes to fill and for a moment it feels like Alden is playing Harrison Ford playing Han Solo. He seemed more preocupied in getting the Solo-isms a la Ford right rather than play the part. That said this is only at the beginning of the movie and as the story progresses you can see Alden becoming more comfortable in the role and making it his own.Overall a good origin movie; fun and entertaining to watch. If you're expecting an epic action Summer Blockbuster this is not the movie you're looking for.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
1360,jrdn-wms,I don't want to be this negative but here we go,1,6 June 2018,"I just didn't like this movie and created an account just to write it somewhere. Apparently you have to be a real critic to write a review on Rotten Tomatoes. Anyways, someone on Rotten Tomatoes put it well in saying that Solo took all of the imagination out of the Star Wars story. To me it felt like it filled in too many blanks. Why couldn't Han's last name simply be Solo? It didn't need to be an English nickname. It killed the idea that he could be otherworldly. Oh, and let's go ahead and point out that we'll call Chewbacca ""Chewie"" from now on.
I went into this wondering if they would mention the Kessell Run not knowing that would be the whole plot to the entire movie. It's like they didn't try to be creative and it killed my imagination. Let's just explain it all. The Lando guy did a good Lando impersonation- I still don't like the character. Let's really talk about these capes because that's different, right? Ugh. I imagine that's to sell figurines and Halloween costumes. Thanks Disney. They wrote for Han to give a wookie impression? To me it felt like breaking the 4th wall rather than adding context. Just have Han speak English to him and they understand each other. I wish they had left my imagination to think the way they understand one another had a mystique. Like clairvoyant we-just-understand-each-other thing. The writers just seemed compelled to explain every single thing.For what it's worth, Woody Harrelson did a good job playing Woody Harrelson.I just thought they could've slowed the story down and taken things in a different direction. It felt more like a comic book origin story than something special. This goes on the list of movies to watch when you're sick. You know, when you're sprawled on the couch and you can turn over only to listen while you're half asleep. And they could've picked someone to play Han that was as tall as Harrison Ford and had him complain more. He was all smiles and looked more like the double for Lone Star in Spaceballs if I was suffering from face blindness.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

1362,daltonfordyce,Shindler's List is more colorful than this grey movie,6,22 February 2019,"The story, while not anything special, is servicable and is a good vehicle for some good, surprisingly well written characters. Alden Ehrenreich did a great job embodying a Han Solo who hadn't learnt to be a badass yet. It's a better movie than might say, but is it a good Star Wars film? Ehh, that's debatable.Unfortunately there are two things that hinder this movie most of all.1: The world-building is just about non-existent to the point that half the time I dont even know what planet the damn scene is taking place on and some conflicts happen without their being any context that places it within a history that is tangible.
On one hand, it lets this movie stand alone very well. On the other hand, it feels about half as much like Star Wars as The Phantom Menace did because it's almost only implied that these two movies take place in the same universe.2: This movie is the greyest, most bland, dreary looking movie I've seen since Birth of a Nation. Visually, everything blends in with each other like they turned the saturation levels down to zero. Which might work better for a contempory Noir film taking place in a sewer in Chicago, but for a fun, mystical fantasy sci-fi movie it just takes all the life out of the screen. Like, what the hell, this isn't The Dark Knight or Ivan's Childhood! The Star Wars universe was made to be colorful and exuberant, not a grey Rorschach drawing.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

And i must say this movie is really great, the editing ,the lighting, costumes and all the actors are just brilliant. It is a real good movie with far better cinematographic qualities then the last trilogy. Alden Ehrenreich really does a great job on a task that is really hard to take on.

Action packed, yes but lacking the humour, real drama and character development. The portrayal of the young Han tries to mimic Harrison Ford in every way possible but the results are just mediocre. Good news is that Woody Harrelson never disappoints and Emilia Clark, who plays Han Solo's love interest Qi'ra, steals the thunder retrospectively from almost all previous female Star Wars characters with her compromised innocence, hidden skills and extravagant wardrobe.

I went in with an open mind and no expectations and I have to say it was a great time! Right from the beginning it feels as if you are riding a ride at Disneyland. Sure, the story feels the same as some of the others, but isn't that a little what Star Wars is about? It's okay to be campy and the same. Visually, I was pleasantly surprised by this film. I enjoy a film that doesn't rely on CGI for every scene (think Marvel). It felt as if you were there and could feel everything within the scene. I give Alden credit for his portrayal, if you don't focus on the exact looks and glance the smirks and tone, than he did a great job as Han. The little eastereggs in the film are nice and the character we see in the end is interesting. Go into this film knowing that the Star Wars movies are here to entertain and allow us to explore a little bit of that universe ourselves.

1377,jonas-vanderfraenen,"""Everyone has a story""",7,5 October 2018,"What started as a useless new anthology story in the Star Wars franchise, finally turned out to be a film worthy of belonging to the franchise. The expectations where very high for the interpretation of Han Solo by until then fairly unknown Alden Ehrenreich. But from the beginning to the end he was a genius. He provided a perfect rendition of the character, immortalized by Harrison Ford. I sincerely believed that this was the young Harrison Ford... or rather, the young Han Solo. A tribute to the casting.The story itself did not add much to the Skywalker franchise, but in one way or another it appealed to me. Excitement, plottwists and a touch of humor all placed in a perfect picture. The presence of L3 was for me the moment of the film.All in all, this is definitely recommended for the Star Wars enthusiast!

1378,evanlu-43779,Better than it could be,7,23 July 2019,"I wasn't expecting the film to be good, because I do not think Han Solo needs an origin story, we know this character's personality in the original trilogy already. Judging from the movie itself though, it's a pretty decent film. The characters are interesting, the plot doesn't have big problems, and there are a ton of references. As a Star Wars fan, I do believe I enjoy this film a lot more than those who aren't really into the franchise.My biggest gripe however, comes down to the character portrayal of Han Solo in this film. He is too righteous in the film. In my opinion, Han Solo should be a selfish smuggler who does anything for himself only.Overall, this film is pretty good. I'm glad that the movie expands the universe of Star Wars, it ties in a lot of stuffs in comics, cartoons and novels and move them to the big screen. Plus, I love the secret cameo in it. Hopefully he'll appear soon in upcoming movies. I'm so excited for his return. In the end, this is an enjoyable journey in a galaxy far far away.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
1379,6StringSamurai,"Fun, but lacked anything revelatory",7,25 July 2018,"This was a fun, outer space romp of a movie. That's all that can really be said about it. If it wasn't about Han Solo, and just another outer space adventurer, it would be chalked up to a fun distraction, but nothing special. However, the film is about Han Solo, beloved scoundrel to generations of fans, so doing a film about his early days was always an uphill battle. First, they had the unfortunate task of trying to get someone to fill in Harrison Ford's rather epic shoes. Alden Ehrenreich does his best, but no one was ever going to get it right, especially coming on the heels of Ford returning to the role after 30+ years. Despite this, it could have all worked out rather nicely, if they had brought something new to the character. Unlike the last Star Wars anthology film (Rogue One), this film utterly fails to bring anything new to the story we already knew. We knew that Han was from Corellia, went to the Imperial Academy, we knew he freed Chewie from slavery, we knew that he made the Kessel Run in less than 12 parsecs, we knew that Chewie was 200 years old, we knew that he won the Falcon in a card game from Lando, we know that Han shoots first. Some of these things are straight out of the original trilogy, some are from the expanded universe that has been a part of the SW saga for so long. The point is that it was as if the filmmakers just had a checklist of fan service items that they ran down in order to lock these items firmly into Star Wars canon. Rogue One, on the other hand, takes a story that we already knew, and builds off of that. They take a plot element that had been considered a bit of a weakness in A New Hope (the fact that such a huge weakness in the Death Star went completely unnoticed) and made that vulnerability an act of deliberate sabotage. That revelation strengthened the original film and made the new film that much more compelling. Solo, for all it's fun, didn't add anything. It didn't enhance the character, or flesh him out in any way: Han had a mentor once. (So?) He had a girlfriend once (So?). Lando was a card cheat (duh). The only big revelation that happens is that Han's girlfriend works for Darth Maul. I loved that actually, because I love Darth Maul. But he come way out of left field at the end of the movie. Okay, Qi'ra is working for him. So? Han knows nothing about that and it doesn't affect him in any way. So what's the point? It's a standalone film, so where are they going with this? You can't have Maul interact with Han in any meaningful way, because he doesn't believe in the Force until he meets Luke years later. Despite all this, I did like the movie. It wasn't on the epic scale of the other movies, but it was fun. Donald Glover was born to play Lando, and this was a solid heist film. But that, unfortunately, is all.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

Ron Howard did an excellent job, and I hope he makes more Star Wars movies in the future. I'm surprised that there are many negative reviews about this movie.Most of the characters in this movie were very good. I expected Han Solo to be a bad character and nothing like the original trilogy, but Alden Ehrenreich was way better than I expected. Chewbacca was one of the best parts of the movie. Lando was also very good and sounded just like the original actor. Beckett and Qi'ra were also good characters, and Dryden was a good villain. The jokes in this movie, especially between Solo, Chewbacca, and Lando, were very funny. The entire movie was very exciting and turned out to be a great adventure. Some of the parts that I really liked was when Han Solo and Chewie met, Chewie drinking both of the wine glasses when Han finds Qi'ra was funny, the story behind the falcon was very good, and Chewbacca delivers the best performance ever.The only downsides of this movie were that the droid L3 was very annoying. I was glad that they killed her off. Disney finally killed off the right character. She made a couple really stupid jokes, especially with the one with Lando. There were also a little too many plot twists at the end. I was shocked at how Darth Maul came in at the end. I liked it in a way, but I also did not like it in a way because I liked how Obiwan killed Darth Maul at the end of episode I.

Taking place about 10-15 years before Star Wars A New Hope, it does of course show us how Han Solo met Chewbacca, and so on - and it´s both interesting and highly entertaining to see exactly how it happened! Alden Ehrenrich is a perfect casting choice as the young Han Solo, and this is coming from a big Harrison Ford fan that at first was hesitating - but gosh, one has to relax a little and just enjoy it all! He is great! As Harrison Ford said himself when watching it: ""He nailed it!""It all reminds me of the time I saw Han Solo the first time in 1977 when I was a kid (especially the Kessel run scene) but here Han Solo is still a naive young man that is slowly learning the hard way to trust in no one but Chewie. We see what shapes our beloved space pilot. It´s basically the dirtiest Star Wars movie so far, and it´s fun to see how the character develops through the movie. It´s exciting and it happens a lot! As I said it´s simply a great adventure! Take it easy and just enjoy it! So whatever internet trolls might be telling you otherwise is nuts!

1386,dgardiner-16144,Not as bad as I expected,7,26 May 2018,"The film was not as bad as I had expected. I saw mostly negative reviews around Youtube and other areas and was preparing myself for the worst, especially after the disaster that was the last jedi, however I was pleasantly surprised to find this movie was mediocre. The good:
Ever wondered how Han met Chewbacca, what the kessel run was?, what happened in the game where Lando lost the Falcon to Han?, How Han became involved with Jabba? Or what the planet Corellia was like? Well all these questions are answered in this film and answered quite well. 
It's also good to see what the Falcon was like when it was fairly new and in pristine condition.
The relationship between Lando and Han in their younger days and how they first met is also interesting, how they went from hating each other to.becoming friends and I did see some parallels between the early relationship between Han and Luke.
The visuals were quite well done and we learn a bit more about the various crime syndicates in the Galaxy which had hitherto only been seen in the Clone Wars and RebelsThe Bad:
The new characters don't do enough to make the audience care about what happens to them. Beckett is somewhat interesting but can't really be considered much of a mentor as he sells Han out at the end, he told Han not trust anyone including him.
Kira is not interesting at all, nothing is revealed about her background, why she ended up working for Darth Maul and the crime gangs after being seperated from Han. Nor is it made clear whether she has any feeling for Han and it doesn't matter because we know he ends up with Leia anyway. It might have been better to have her as Lando's love interest instead.
Dryden is an OK villain, not much more can be said about him, given that we learn at the end he is a pawn working for Maul. 
Alden Ehrenreich is not in the same league as Harrison Ford (but who else could be) and Han by the end of this film is far more altruistic and optimistic that the Han we see at the start of A New Hope, I don't know if there will be another Han Solo film that will change his perspective and turn him into the ""in it for himself"" person that he is in the original film.
To sum up, this movie is OK, I might go and see it again and will certainly buy it on blue ray.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

And now I fall to the hype again... NEVER again! Star Wars is dead.What is wrong? everything. The tone, the mood, the darkness, the plot, the characters, the main actor (yes, we knew that). I keep reading it is funny..... how? when? And as for Star Wars: IT IS NOT. Never ever has a Star Wars NOT started in SPACE. The crawl, I didn't mind in Rogue One. Why? because we start in space as it must be. Not only that... we don't see space up to until an HOUR into the movie. This is not Star Wars! When we finally see it in the Falcon is so underwhelming that it broke my hearth. Seeing the Falcon fly out to space was always a thrill... here is tiresome! Alden tries to make an impression of amazement looking out of the Falcon's cockpit... sorry it's not. And then we move to Daenerys searching in the Falcon's wardrobe and looking at a mirror.... NOT JOKING. That's where I walked out.Photography is so dark and dull that I could not even grasp many of the so called action sequences... the actors were terrible, not even the so often praised Donald Glover.... not impressed at all. Give me a Jyn Erso before this Lando mimick, any time. I am not even going to talk too much about the PC crap... that droid was even hilarious in the bad way.Just compare to Rogue One.... where are the grandiose shots of spaceships leaving/arriving at planets? where are the light blaster bolts? where are the neat sounds? NO is not the theatre... I watched Solo in the same place I watched Rogue One.So... two stars, one for Chewie and another for... meh some action pieces. Thinking that Star Wars is just 6 movies and Rogue One just a guilty pleasure.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

1389,krizsangergely,Perfect sci-fi western in the star wars universe,10,27 May 2018,"Creators paid attention to the small details and made a colorful, living star wars setting. We could see Empire's Infantry fighting in trenches and not the shiny stormtroopers. We could get a glipse of the Empire's propaganda machine and also how rotten the whole system is. All achived without Death Star IV :)
The plot has been intresting, sometimes a bit obvious, but on the complexity scale at least 10 times better then the Last Jedi. No logical errors mostly, and nice character developments. They used humor in the right portion, but also added drama. Overall a good sci-fi/fantasy movie.
The Crime Boss (Dryden Vos) here has been much more frightening than Kylo Ren ever will be, which means a red lightsabre is cool, but doesn't substitute character ;)
I don't know why IMDB rating is so low for this film, but I also don't know what people liked in Force Awakens or in the Last Jedi.

The Last Jedi was an awful addition to this great franchise, the worst film of the lot and that's including all spin offs, animations and the prequel trilogy.

This is a separate story to the usual Jedi Star Wars stuff.
It's in the Star Wars universe, that's why it's called a Star Wars story.
But it stands on its own!
And it's damn good, with excellent acting, a very good story and excellent rhythm.
I'm re-watching it in 3D, where I think it will be stellar(!).
But the 2D is perfectly good, with excellent moments and a lot of surprises (no spoilers!).
I'll only say the dark side shows up near the end, in the shape of Darth Vader's predecessor.
And the idea of making the robot L3 a girl is total genius!

I was intrigued by her character wanted to see how she changed Han but we don't really get that. This film brings nothing to Star Wars and is only half of Han's story.

1396,alexkobuss,A fun action movie,7,24 May 2018,"I went into the cinema with no expectations at all. I feared the worst, especially after The Last Jedi left me with mixed feelings.
I liked Rogue One very much and this movie isn´t quite as good, but a good movie none the less. Camera:
As it is with all new Star Wars movies, they are visually stunning. The colour scheme goes into the darker territory, like Rogue One, but has some nice contrasts in there, which fit the tone of the movie well.Soundtrack: 
John Powell does a decent job. the music isn´t outstanding and lives mostly from the classical themes that it picks up, eventhough it has its moments. John Williams wrote the main theme for this movie, which is fun and as good as you´d expect from the master himself. Acting: 
I was pleasantly suprised with Aldren Ehrenreichs performance as the young Han Solo. It´s no suprise that he can´t emulate the Harrison Ford-Charisma, but he does a good Han Solo. Woody Harrelson is as good as ever, as he takes the mentor role as a mercenary called Tobias Backett. The highlight is definetly Donald Glovers young Lando Calrissian, you feel like he was born for that role; very good.Story:
The story is nothing new. which is good and bad at the same time. The movie is at its weakest when it tries to envoke emotional moments, that don´t live up to the scenes that movies like Rogue One did. The big advantage is that it doesn´t screw up characters that we know (cough, cough, TLJ...). 
It has the scenes that you expect from a Han Solo movie like meeting Chewie etc. They were handled tastefully and without too much fan-service.
There are the usual eastereggs and even some unusual ones, for the people who have seen the Clone Wars and Rebels series, which may leave people who haven´t seen those a bit confused in one particular moment at the end, which you have to see for yourself.To conclude:
It´s a fun movie, which is not the big story revelation of the Saga, but a decent flick for sure. You don´t notice the change of directors and its a fun ride all the way. 
The new Star Wars movies have a bit of a struggle with an alleged political agenda (not to say, that Star Wars wasn´t always political). I have to admidt that The Last Jedi was a bit too much on the nose for my taste. But this movie is one of the most apolitcal movies in the Saga. 
You have Landos Droid L337, but that character is more comic relief than agenda pushing, so don´t worry about the ""SJW infestation of Star Wars"" or whatever some Youtube Review will inevetably say.Go into the theater and just relax and enjoy a fun movie, with a nice background story for the galaxies favourite scoundrel.

This was just a fun movie to watch and experience in a movie theater. We see young Han Solo as he goes through every story that we have heard about him in other Star Wars movies: How he got his ship, how he met Lando Calrissian, how he made the Kessel Run in 12 parsecs, and even some things that weren't talked about in the movies, like how he met Chewie, and how he got his name. The squeezing of Han Solo's entire life can be a bit uncomfortable at times, but you forget it all by the third act, where everything unfolds and you are on the edge of your seat waiting for the crazy thing that will happen next.

Without wanting to spoil too much, there's a few interesting Star Wars locations that finally make an appearance in the movie universe: Corellia, Kessel, The Maw... And I liked the actors. I didn't find the plot that predictable, but it's true that the director crammed a lot of stuff in there and maybe it would've been okay to leave some out. But some new characters, like L3, were refreshing. And the movie, although not with Harrison, is an addition to the Han Solo character: especially to his rough exterior vs Good Guy on the inside.

1408,simhill,Passionless.,4,1 June 2018,"If you're a Star Wars fan, you'll probably be soaked into the branding of the universe. Everyone else? Maybe not. I say ""branding"" because that's all it seems to be now. No sense of wonder, intrigue, more just obligation. I was bored throughout the first two acts. After the Kessel Run I felt done with the movie, the third act tried to cough up interesting developments but it was too late for me by then. I had no one to be invested in. Han wasn't the Han Solo we know and love, a completely diluted version of the Harrison Ford performance. Qi'ra was dull. As was Beckett, which is odd because Woody Harrelson has the talent to do something with that role. Donald Glover was making clear and interesting choices but had nothing to do with them but sit around.One could make the tired argument that expecting someone to match Ford is unfair, but if you're going to make a Han Solo movie without aspiring to at least match what we loved in the original movies then why do it at all?I'm bordering on a 4 or a 5 really. What dips into below-average territory for me is the ultimate cardinal movie sin of being boring. I'm not usually the nit-pick type, but when I'm sat there, trying to turn my brain off yet can still predict the script verbatim then something is seriously wrong. And when the plot is so easy to predict what do I have to look forward to? Characters? As I said, performed adequately but blandly. Music? Generic, which is saying something for a Star Wars movie. The action? It's fine, but again, easy to read which takes all the fun out of it. There was one cool moment where the Falcon slaps a Tie Fighter like a frying pan. That's it.The thing that really makes me sad though, is that this is what his backstory is now. Whenever I look at Harrison's Solo I'm going to be burdened with the washed-out backstory and memories of him being bosses around by a horribly annoying robot. Thanks for that.

I honestly don't understand, looking at movie quality, that this was nominated for awards and even won one. To get straight to the point: this movie is not true to the character Han Solo, the plot is extremely predictable with long-drawn-out sequences to try and ""fill the time"", with a few very weak attempts at breaking the boredom with some flat one-liner humor.
If you expect Han the scoundrel, Han the privateer, or Han the badass, move right along because you will not find it in this movie. The whole movie feels completely unnecessary, is following a boringly predictable plotline, with all the template elements that make a production like this a ""safe investment"" but far from an exciting movie to watch, and I could not make myself watch more than half of it.

Why bother with cool sets if you can't see the darn things? I guess Meghan Markle's daddy, with his heart trouble and all, wasn't available to dial up the lighting a tad so we could actually see what was going on.
The dim lighting aside, a decent origin story, with Rogue One coming to the same point in the chronology from another direction. As with Daisy Ridley, an appealing set of fresh faces, but unlike with lucky Daisy, the Star Wars caravan has moved on and so alas these characters have ""aged into"" the iconic actors we've all come to know and love. At least we now have a pretty good idea who shot first in the cantina in episode IV.
Still, this ain't a highpoint either for Ron Howard, or for the saga. Frankly, I think even Rogue One did a better job with backstory, but maybe I'm just unhappy that the Mother of Dragons wound up with such an unsatisfying story (unless I just missed her in a later episode--and the way Lucas has re-cut and CGIed some of these films, you never can tell. The way I figure, Episode III takes place before Solo, so alas Qi'ra seems to be consigned to a deadend side plot.)",Solo - A Star Wars Story

I wish they would have focused more on the dark reality of Han Solos ""career"". I liked all the actors they selected but the guy that played Han just wasn't Harrison Ford. It took me about half the movie to get over how different the actor looked and sounded. As well, he didn't have enough sarcasm and sass Han truly does. I love Emilia Clarke she's an amazing actress BUT her part just seemed kind of unnecessary up until the ending. Which left off with a cliff hanger!!! I really hope the do choose to make a sequel of some sorts because I would love to know what happens to all of them and how everything plays out.

1417,FilmNerd2017,Another decent Star Wars spin-off,7,25 June 2018,"Everyone's favorite space pirate in the Star Wars series has finally gotten his own origin story film from the brilliant directors of The Lego Movie, 21 Jump Street, and 22 Jump...oh...right. I mean, from Ron Howard, the director of...um...well...a lot of stuff that I've never seen. I guess you could say, from the director who simply asks that you each go and see this movie 1100 more times so Disney doesn't have to write off more than a $50 million dollar loss for this box office dog.The story overall is fairly decent. Like Rogue One, and unlike other prequels (cough...Wolverine...cough...X-Men: Apocalypse...cough) it manages to tie everything together pretty well in terms of stuff like how Han met Chewbacca and Lando, and how he acquired the Millennium Falcon. To some extent, the story manages to show some slight character development to help it work out as a good standalone film, such as Han learning how to find a balance between being a criminal and doing the right thing. And they don't hesitate to include some clever jokes as well. Plus, I like how a chunk of the film tells the story of how Han has the Millennium Falcon become ""the ship that made the kessel run in less than 12 parsecs"" which according to Family Guy and Wookieepedia is actually a unit of distance, not time, equal to 3.26 light years, which in this case is 39.12 light years. I will say though that as far as story goes, I had little to no expectations to be met. It only met my expectation of a good story, but nothing more, which is sort of both an okay thing and a thing that makes you feel kinda ""meh"" towards the film. But on the bright side, at least this isn't a sequel to a preceding film that paved the way to all kinds of interesting subplots with potential revelations only for them all to be thrown away like garbage (cough...Last Jedi...cough...probably shoulda stuck with one director and the same team of writers...cough...cough!)The cast is terrific. Alden Ehrenreich and Donald Glover both prove to be good fits for Han and Lando respectively by managing to capture the same charms and charisma unique to Harrison Ford and Billy Dee Williams (the latter of whom needs to make a comeback in the new ones!). Little hard to judge Joonas Suotamo as Chewbacca since he has minimal expressions and all of his lines are roars and grunts. Still, Chewie's always awesome no matter what, and as per usual what little we get out of him combined with how he interacts with the other characters is enough to make him an interesting character. My only major complaint about Chewie for this film is that I just wish we get to see him shoot a lot more people. Also like Woody Harrelson as Han's mentor Beckett. He also has his own sense of charisma. Can't say a whole lot about Emilia Clarke's role as Han's girlfriend. She's good as the character, but that's pretty much it. Definitely can't say much about Paul Bettany as her sadistic, psychopathic mob boss. Lastly, while no major droid character will ever match C-3PO, R2-D2, and especially K2-SO, Lando's female droid sidekick L-3 still proves to be a fascinating addition to the cast. What I like about her is that as a comic relief character she's supposed to act as a very liberal droid who detests ill-treatment towards droids, even female beings for that matter, so to me she represents all the Star Wars fans who complain about the original films' accidentally limited sense of diversity that Disney has been trying to remedy which I think is hilarious.The action scenes are pretty good. The best ones for me mostly come from the middle of the film onwards. We get a pretty great shootout scene, a cool space chase with the Millennium Falcon that sort of reminisces towards the asteroid chase from Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back, and a conclusion with some interesting complexities mixed with some western film elements. But like I said before, Chewie doesn't shoot many people which sucks.The VFX, set design, and choices of locations are used to spectacular effect, creating backgrounds and environments that are fun to look at and are fitting. I especially love the design of the Millennium Falcon for this film both inside and out, especially the inside with all the nice cool-colored lighting and white interior. It actually looks better at this point in time, but then again, it's the old days, it's supposed to look new, so obviously it has to look like it hasn't been through much yet, especially before Han and Chewie use it as their smuggler's bachelor pad or whatever.So, despite me having limited expectations, despite this film only meeting some of those expectations but failed to go way beyond, despite Chewie's limited shooting time, and despite the fact that as a spin-off, it can't match the cinematic masterpiece that is Rogue One, this movie is pretty great, all thanks to a great cast, great visuals, and great action scenes. So, all in all, Ron Howard did a terrific job, enough to renew some HOPE that Rian Johnson kinda took away from us fans. NOW GIVE US A YODA ORIGIN STORY!!!

I heard different ones going into my second viewing. I'm assuming I'll hear more when I see it for the third time next week. It's an unfortunate age we live in when a small group of people can alter the trajectory of a film simply through littering the internet with b.s. For all intents and purposes Solo does what The Last Jedi couldn't or wouldn't do: remind you what Star Wars is all about. The complaints about replacing Harrison Ford with Alden Ehrenrich are needless. He captures the cockiness and charisma of a young Han Solo if not a young Ford, but remember, Mark Hamill himself played the shadow of Luke Skywalker we saw in The Last Jedi. Ehrenrichs performance is true to the character and that's what is important.

I hope there is more variety in accents in future movies. My only concern is that this is the last Solo movie because the Solo we meet in 'A New Hope' has not yet been fully developed.

But for me the spotlight was Chewbacca. His character was really improved in this movie and i really liked it. Woody Harrelson was also really good, but i didn't care for his character. Donald Glover as Lando was as i expected, good. I think that Donald Glover is a very talented actor. T3 was really funny, but again i didn't care for her.The story is pretty average. It's a character story followed by a heist story followed by a 3rd act.The visual effects were awesome. The train scene was a lot of fun and my favourite scene. I also noticed that the sound mixing was really good.Other things: the reveal of a old bad character was pretty good, but i have no idea what Disney is going to do with it. The jokes were for the most part pretty good. And my god, finally Han shot first again.8/10

1423,AdamRowe135,Great movie packed with Star Wars references and Empire strikes back feel,7,24 May 2018,Why does everyone hate this film? It's full of smart Star Wars references and was a great way to expand the star wars universe. It had a very complex but smart ending and was full with loving characters and reenactions of iconic scenes like his two signature movies. They nailed the cast as they made it the funniest Star Wars film yet. L-3 was great with her quick wit and I loved every minute of the film expetialy the twists. It was not just a cash grab like MIB2 and deserve higher rating!! 8/10,Solo - A Star Wars Story
1424,ososment,Pretty great.,8,22 September 2018,"The script, direction, edit and performance all worked as far as I'm concerned. It had the same textural feel of the original trilogy, with just enough references to ground it and avoid the soft reboot feel of the sequels.There's some great costumes, I especially liked the infantry uniforms when Han was on Mimban.I liked the casting too, Bettany was great in every scene, Glover rocked Lando, Clarke owned the vulnerable spy role, Ehrenreich was much better as Han than I originally thought his vocal tone and timing when delivering his lines really did make his role.The script avoids the turgid mess of some of the sequels, it's got a sense of star wars grandeur at times but keeps focused on the characters arc without lapsing into tedious introspection or feeling the need to lay seeds of future complications.The effects feel solid, old school and lots of it looks to be in camera, which is always a buzz. In fact having looked up some of the effects, Waller-Bridge certainly deserves more recognition than just being the voice of L3-37.The direction is deft and rarely misses. It almost feels like a road movie at times then expands into pretty glorious and vast scenes. Editing wise, rapid scenes don't lose focus or coherence, scenes that in other movies on the franchise would drag are dealt with quickly, it reminded me of the original, lots done with short scenes.Is it perfect? Well no. There's a few bits that clunk a little, but not so much it draws you from the story... well, all except how did Han know wookie? I suspect that explanation is on the cutting room floor.Also while the score is generally good, it was a disappointment when Han first flies the Falcon, sure the rousing element might have been saved for his first ""use in anger' as it were, but it still felt a little underwhelming.It's fun, it's got some great scenes, it pulls it off. Go watch it.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

Ron Howard was the perfect choice to lead and Kasdan (writer of The Empire Strikes Back the greatest Star Wars movie ever) was his writing equal.

It has characters and fan lip service which I'm not sure I understand, but notice it anyway, much of which I'm not sure if it's easter eggs or not. It does bear all of the hallmarks of prequels which have very little to do with the source material they are a prequel to, so I feel a little ripped off that I've paid to see star wars and gotten something... else?That being said, it seems the budget is massively smaller than the latest star wars movies in terms of the visuals, and I found myself constantly rewinding to figure out if I had missed crucial scenes because the plot didn't seem to make sense from one act to the next. The brightness was also very dim, we tried watching it in the day with our 65"" OLED and the blinds closed and it was difficult to see much detail. It wasn't much better at night. Would I recommend this to star wars fans? I've no idea, I'm guessing no? Would I recommend this to casual movie viewers? Either I have missed key moments or I just don't understand the importance of whatever is going on, so regretfully that is a no too. I feel the same way as I did when I watched the star trek reboots and std, in that they don't appear to have anything other than intellectual property in common with the rights they are using. I'm getting pretty sick of these prequels and reboots to be honest. They seem to range from bad to worse.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

Far from being brilliant or bringing something new, Solo, is a honest film with simple ambitions. It does the job of providing to the audience a fun cool ride, and that's it.

Woody Harelson was born to play his character and Emilia Clark is sweet and deadly as always.
2) It is true to the original storyline, tying together many facts and sentences from movies 4 & 5.

This is a formula for a doomed film and this is exactly what happened. I personally enjoyed the action though it was too much at times as it's more of Indiana Jones than Star Wars style, acting good but the lime light was the sets and photography which you would expect from a very rich movie studio.

1441,thomascosgrove,Plenty to like,8,16 June 2018,"*Force Awakens spoiler below*Held off for a long time before finally going to see this. Probably swayed by some of the negative user reviews. A friend told me it was good and I agree with that now. The opening is really cool, and it keeps up a breakneck pace for a long long time. The heist on the snow train has some spectacular action and visuals. The music borrows a lot of the great John Williams themes, and has it's own confident orchestration by a would be heir to that throne. Some people complain about the lead actor. Okay so he might not look like young Harrison Ford, but he's still very good, and does everything he's asked to do really well. The supporting cast are all great too. I would have liked an imperial / alien villain and less of a ""human"" one, but that's okay. Honestly if you couldn't find stuff to like in this movie then something's up. Great visuals, alien creatures, action, music, and good rapport between the cast all adds up to an enjoyable two hours of escapism. They should never have killed off Han Solo in Force Awakens. That was a waste. This was very enjoyable and Ron Howard did a brilliant job. Give it a shot.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

Well worth seeing - don't believe the anti-hype!",Solo - A Star Wars Story
1444,nkohl-84918,Going at it solo: A hopeful space-western for the new generation,9,30 December 2019,"When looking at Star Wars now, I do realize I have a very different outlook on these movies than when I was a kid. Being from that awkward middle-generation that is old enough to grow up with the original trilogy for a couple years, but witnessing the prequels shortly after and developing (varying degrees, but) a strong fondness to both, I always asked myself the question: why do I like these movies so much? After a lot of attempts to describe it in detail, I think I have come to a very simple conclusion: Star Wars is as great as it is because it appeals to our very drive to do good, to be bigger than the sum of our parts, even if we fail sometimes.It is about hope, the value of resistance, about generations passing the baton to other generations in hope that their mistakes will not be repeated by them. Following a very traditional narrative, Star Wars has never been about extensive narrative flourishes or even overly concerned with explaining itself in the movies, it has relayed its concepts through one thing primarily: characters. Characters that inspire us to look up to them, even though they sometimes fall victim to the same flaws that we all have. Characters that could choose to run away, but choose to stay to believe in something bigger than themselves. In Star Wars, almsot no one is so far gone as to not be redeemed, and the one who is is appropriately the bane of the whole universe. Star Wars is about hope and the people believing in the good in others and themselves, even though it is not the rational thing to do. That is what makes it timeless, what makes it enjoyable to kids and adults alike.Thus, whenever I watch Star Wars now, I ask myself: Can I connect to the characters? Do I like the thematic approach to the material? Do I think that if I were a kid again, I would be inspired by it, and can I, as an adult, still get some more deeper layers out of it than just the basic themes and some neat action?Solo, for me, is the one movie of the Disney-SW-era and the first film since ROTJ in the universe where I can answer every question with a resounding yes. It is the first of all Star Wars movies since ROTJ to take characters, confidently place them in a story that is both accessible but has some layers, and put them in situations that let´s them grow and evolve in a natural, not overly plot-related way.In this sense, whoever made the call to choose a script that has a very clear arch with relatable character- and narrative goals, made the right decision for me. Over all, Star Wars has always been incredibly simple in its basic plot-outline. Solo strikes a good balance by having a story that is immediately accesible to viewers of basically all ages with clear stations and dangers - it´s always clear what everyone has to do and why and why the main badguy is a threat to them - while also letting its characters enough time to breathe, to interact. There does not have to be non-stop-action if no one cares about the characters. As the movie shows admirably, by establishing the goals of everyone early on and test their values instead of just throwing nonsense-obstacles in their way, it is quite more engaging than just a barrage of lasers and explosions.Solo plays out very traditional in technical regard, with central setpieces that obviously draw from a plethora of Westerns. It features a competently helmed, non-excessive train-heist, a smokey mine-setting and the traditional high-noonish space of transformation, the desert. Even the camera often pays homage to Westerns of old and new, using wide-shots and close-ups of eyes and blasters in reference to these movies. The film itself is held in a muddy brown-grey in a lot of places, which surely is a point to be concerned about for some, but for me, as it clearly references the well-worn rust and dust of the western and it contrasts it with bright colors and vistas enough to make it both feel incredibly lived in and exciting, it works incredibly well. This is the look I love for Star Wars.But as written before, characters come first, and Solo has fascinating ones in spades, the highlight being Han himself. But to highlight the main-cast: Qi´ra is mysterious and competent, yet you can always feel a sense of doubt in herself and that she may have gone in a few darker places than Han can understand. Beckett, too, is rogue-ish and charming, but he never let´s there be any doubt that his survival alone is the one thing he cares about most. It´s not that he is without emotion, but his allegiance is to himself. Han juxtaposes both beautifully: not the most competent yet not without some clear merits, he is the green-horn of the bunch, someone who has gone on a dark path outside the law who still apparantly clings to the idea that everything can be as it was if everyone tries hard enough. What makes this all so great is the thematic unity of it all. These characters, while outwardly reading like clichees, aka ""femme fatale"",""gruff mentor"" and ""rookie in over his head"", all fall into place beautifully because they ask the same thematic question in the movie without outright stating it: Can we choose to be better than this world shapes us to be? Will we choose kindness and hope or selfishness and cynicism? Solo has some brilliant, subtle solutions for all these answers and comes to a conclusion with its trifecta of characters that is both uplifting and bitter at the same time. It does not try to cheapen its characters and world by giving easy answers and devolving someone into a mustache-twirling evil-does who was evil all along, no, everything is handled with grace and thematic confidence. This is why I would rate this movie as the best of the Disney-bunch: it has a thematic vision that is always clear yet developed and nuanced beautifully, it takes its audience seriously and rewards it for paying attention. All of that is packed in a shell of a fast-moving, yet comprehensible (and funny!) space-western that does not overstay its welcome.So in the end, this may seem odd enough when talking about a movie with a prominent directorial change, but this movie feels like somebody´s vision. I now know Han even better without having to change my concept of the character. Nothing here feels out of line with him, nothing like a rewrite of what this rogue-ish oddball was in the orginal trilogy and beyond. All of that is delivered while it enrichens the world of Star Wars and the themes Han Solo had to deal with and has to deal with in the Original Trilogy. It harkens back to the central themes of hope, resistance and the difficulty of choosing good in the face of evil. This is what a Spinoff should do!Sidenote: The chemistry between Han and Chewie is handled wonderfully as well, it is understated and classy. The movie knows, too, to be funny when it needs to lighten up the mood a bit, without resorting to quips and oneliners. Star Wars in the OT always was funny when it wanted to be without outright stating it, there were blink-and-you-miss-it-lines that did not need a hint with the camera or other audience-cues. If you liked the style of humor that the original and Empire had, especially Han´s remarks, you´ll like this, too.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

1448,iron_druid,It's not a Star Wars story and it's a very bad film,1,24 May 2018,"Let me just say that I am a HUGE fan of Star Wars. I watch the movies, read the comics and the books, buy the lightsabers and all that stuff. But enough is enough!The film starts with really enhanced Instagram color filters. Then we continue to the battlefield where this doesn't remind you at all about a war happening in the stars. We also acknowledge that Chewbacca is an idiot and cannot think of destroying the column by himself; even though the way he does it in the movie, he should have killed Han in the first place while throwing him against that metal bar.In the next scene, we learn something very interesting: in Star Wars the transportation of fragile and important materials is happening by train. Yes Sir, by train! Although there's some good action here, it feels kind of cheesy when a lady smuggler sacrifices herself without reason, just because someone cannot die without drama in Star Wars.Our lady, Emilia Clark, she forgets that she's playing in science fiction war movie, thus she is more like going for shopping in mall or joining a gala. She's constantly dressed up in Hollywood-style-of dresses or whatever that is unfit for action. They don't have chemistry at all with Han. Nobody cares if they are in love or not, even the characters themselves exchange some fake kisses, making their relationship even more awkward.And the even everything else was not bad enough, we have a movie about Han Solo, without Han Solo. The problem is not just that the actor is not looking like Harrison Ford, but he's also not acting as the Han Solo we all know. He's character (scenario/plot) is a super cynical dude. I don't know why the wrote his character like that. The comic-relief with the robot is just plain stupid. I really enjoyed when she died, although I don't get how a robot can really die. Too much drama for Lando in this scene.The movie has a lot of pointless action, they even got Kraken from Pirates of Caribbean into space but still everything looks so boring and expected. Yet the plot twist in the end comes out of nowhere. The character of Han is just ... completely unable to think or act like that. It feels weird that he can actually think or shoot first. Anyway, where this movie takes place? I am asking because it looks like Han Solo should be ~60 old in The Return of the Jedi unless they resurrected Darth Maul.In general: lazy script, very bad pace, bad characters, very flat and uninteresting movie. I don't think I will ever see it again. It's a good movie and it's not about paying a tribute to Han Solo. It's all about Disney milking the cow with a risk-free plot, which looks more like an enumeration of events, rather than an interesting story to tell.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

1461,rudymatile,An insult to star wars,1,30 August 2021,"This ""Solo: A Star Wars Story"" tries in a sluggish way to explain the origins of an emblematic character in the great Star Wars mythology, the mysterious Han Solo. And that's the whole problem, we don't know anything about Han Solo, so the writer tries to find an origin to every of his clothes and accessories.I have never left a movie theater being so angry. This film is a disaster on every levels, a 2.15 hours insult led by an actor who does not at all stick to the arrogant and sarcastic character that Han Solo is. Here we have a ""good guy"", nice from the begining to the end, totally candid and silly. The meeting with Chewbacca, especially the incredible moment when Han speaks in the wookie language, was a real ordeal.The villain has the charisma of a rotten oyster and the final revelation is absolutely pathetic (I love Darth Maul, so don't put him in this dud). The scenes in space with the giant monster are so ugly they might make you become blind.As a huge fan of the six films, and of the character of Han Solo, the shower was freezing over this dud from a distant galaxy, we are far from an absolute masterpiece like The Empire Strikes Back, or even a more uneven episode like Attack of the Clones (which I love).Everything about this movie is fan service and forced explanation. I advise you to stay away from it if you don't want to get old prematurely, the only movies that gave me such a bad time were Suicide Squad, and Dragonball Evolution.Star Wars universe is rich and vast enough to tell any story, in every possible and imaginable genre (why not an investigation on Coruscant, who knows ?), no need to recycle the same subjects and characters to remake Star Wars.I did not even mention the direction or the technique, because the scenario killed all the pleasure xxx I could have had, it was a real insult I would have marked it 0/20 had it been possible.

1462,cerulean_blue_2000,Solid entry that doesn't disrespect the franchise or fans,8,27 May 2018,"I hated the Last Jedi. I thought it was sloppily written by someone with no understanding of story or structure. I thought it disrespected the saga, Star Wars as a franchise. how the force works, JJ Abrams Ep8 set up, the Hero's journey mythos that inspired Lucas, Luke Skywalker, and the fans. Why? So egomaniac Johnson could flip a bird to everyone on Reddit and use gimmick writing? Solo, on the other hand, is Star Wars. It respects the character Han Solo, the universe, the Franchise, and the fans. The underside of the universe was well done - gritty and oh so Star Wars. The story is a basic heist, but I liked it, and the train sequence and the kessel run sequences were well done. I think the lead was miscast - he did a passable job but I was really never able to fully accept him as Solo. What I was able to accept was the idea that a young Han could have been idealistic like that - I loved that, actually. Lando was well done but I thought he should have been more flirty both in general and with Qi'ra - I remember him as a smooth operator with all the ladies (and no doubt everything else) and I didn't get that vibe here. All in all, a solid entry to the franchise, and light years better than The Last Jedi.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

R1 is probably my 2nd favorite of the entire franchise. That said, I was disappointed in Solo. It was entertaining at times, but never really felt like the characters were truly developed. Most importantly, I wanted this to be DARKER. Han is a money-first mercenary in episode 4 and this movie makes his origin more of a happy-go-lucky miscreant rather than someone who has experienced true pain or disloyalty...someone who has never been truly hurt. If it had a little bit more of that R1, ESB darkness that I think the character deserved, easily moves up a few stars for me.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
1466,AlanaJedi,So pleasantly surprised!,10,4 June 2018,"I've been a huge Star Wars fan since 1977 when, at the age of 13, SW blew my mind away! In the early 1990s I read all the SW books I could get my hands on because I wanted more SW stories. 
But I hated Force Awakens and Last Jedi! 
So I went in with no expectations nor excitement to Rogue One and to Solo. I have been plesantly surprised by both! This one more so. 
It was fun and exciting, and witty: it made me laugh many times as did the original SW. 
When I saw that Ron Howard had taken up as director, it gave me a glimmer of hope. More so since he was directed by, and has directed for, George Lucas, and was even offered to direct Episode I by George. And yes, the film felt so much closer to George Lucas' imaginative style. I also enjoyed the fact that while it had the action, the scenes didn't drag on as they tend to do in modern films (such as in the horrible Avengers Infinity War). 
The only thing that I found distracting was the actor playing Solo. While he did a decent job, he is no Harrison Ford. I kept wishing for Anthony Ingruber who was Harrison's double in The Age of Adaline.
Putting that aside, yes, I very much enjoyed Solo and seeing his backstory on the screen!! I even read that George Lucas had visited the set and gave an idea for a scene. So for me, this is back to the true SW universe that Force Awakens and Last Jedi betrayed. I will be seeing Solo again on the big screen and will certainly buy the DVD.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
1467,jacobjame,"Not as bad as people say, but still not great.",4,13 September 2018,"Forgetting the poor casting for the titular Solo, I didn't think the story was that bad. 
A boy (Han) plans to leave his home planet with his girlfriend Qi'ra. his plan goes wrong and only he escapes. He promises to return as soon as he becomes a pilot and gets his own ship. 
In order to escape, he enlists in the military. Due to his arrogance, he is kicked out of the academy and is forced to fight on the front lines of some battle, where he meets Beckett, a criminal pretending to be a soldier. He allows Han (and Chewie) to join his next heist. Not a terrible premise, but the movie suffers from pacing issues and poor writing. For example, two of Beckett's crew die during the heist. One of them, Val, was revealed to be his lover. She died by sacrificing herself to have to job succeed.
Not only did the job fail, but her sacrifice wasn't noble in any way. She just died for some money.Beckett was understandably upset that his crew died.... for about 30 seconds. I'm not exaggerating. He builds two graves, looks mildly sad, punches Han, forgives Han, and forgets about them for the rest of the movie. Another example of bad pacing/writing is in the very next scene. Han, Chewie, and Beckett are on a space Yacht to meet their employer. Han walks around until he runs into his childhood girlfriend, Qi'ra. If this was a normal heist movie that took place on earth, in a city, I would be okay with this random encounter with little explanation. However, this is space. In a huge galaxy, three years later. And they talk to each other as if they bumped into each other in the grocery store. I started to believe that he was just imagining her, because there was no other reason for her to be on that random crime syndicate's yacht.I haven't even begun on the poor dialogue. Some scenes were actually pretty good... until an actor actually spoke, and said something cheesy, or stupid. (Also why the hell does Han speak Wookie in the first place. Where would that have ever been useful)",Solo - A Star Wars Story

Woody is very good, the dragon's mother is a treat for the eye and the ear, and the new Han is not the one to throw away (even if it is not Harrison's league).

Solo does a little of everything. At its core it's almost exactly what I expected it to be: a fun action film about Han, Chewie and Lando - but it also gives you some surprises along the way. The film accomplishes exactly what it sets out to do. The script is good, the cinematography and sound design are excellent, and all in all we were thoroughly entertained. Ehrenreich inherited a seemingly impossible task as Ford's successor, but he does well (the whole cast does well, in fact) and I'm hoping for a sequel since he's signed on for three films.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

 The movie Solo unfortunately, is a time passing distraction. The story seemed more like a 1980's Star Wars Marvel Comic than a movie worth adding to the franchise. It wasn't as bad as The Last Jedi but it tried to be. Aside from trying to replicate the magic of Ford as Han Solo, the most disturbing part of this movie is the PC droid. I, like many people, prefer their entertainment politics free. The Liberal robot who accompanied Lando (played well by Glover) made me bump Jar Jar out of the most hated character spot. Lastly, how did they put none of the original recognizable bounty hunters in this movie?? A blown opportunity.

Here we have a lot of Chewie in a great entertaining movie that delivers visually pleasing action-packed scenes one after another. Solo has a good old adventure film feel that's becoming rare these days, since the current trend seems to be favouring overly anxious, violent and oh-so-gloomy movies. I like all the characters and their actors and have absolutely nothing to complain about the movie itself. Too bad it failed to meet financial expectations so probably we're seeing even less of this kind of movies and just more doom and gloom that seems to sell in these dark and desperate times.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

This whole movie seems to have been shot in the dark, or maybe the lighting technician had been called off on an emergency somewhere else and no knew how to turn the studio lighting on. Lots of backlighting, very little front lighting watching actors do their stuff in the dark and hearing their voices but not being able to see their faces. I wasn't impressed. Even the scenes shot in snow and deserts were dark and gloomy, clearly something wrong with the atmospherics here? Besides all this, as an action venture with no storyline, a pretty aweful script, no real evidential crossover links to the rest of the Star Wars universe its was OK, as a supposed Star Wars movie, in my opinion, it failed badly.....or perhaps I misssed all the good bits whilst I was asleep?",Solo - A Star Wars Story

1485,t-g-1998,Unnecessary but ultimately quality entry into an epic saga,8,27 May 2018,"A pretty pleasant surprise. They actually pulled it off for me. I was concerned about the mixed reviews and the troubled production but was blasted with:Its setting on an outlaw-ridden/underground world, a portion of the Star Wars lore that's been in bits and pieces in the other movies but not that explored. Solo is fully set within that grim, everyone for himself type of world, filled with not only bounty hunters but people going for scraps to pay their overlords, there's also slavery and lots of betting. And I was happy most of the stuff on the ground was practical, it's the most ""tangible"" Star Wars movie yet, the creature and set designs are so good.An engaging set of characters. Alden does a good job as Solo, he's no Ford but who is? He brings his own charm that quickly made me embrace this newer take on the character. Emilia Clarke finally getting a solid blockbuster role as Qi'ra, Woody Harrelson is enjoyable as always as this untrustworthy bounty hunter. And arguably the MVP, Donald Glover rocking with charm and wit as Lando, I liked this even better as Billy Dee's performance. The movie did its job and got down to the essence of Han and how he met Chewie and Lando, I was satisfied. Paul Bettany's villain I also dug, he's nuts and it's the kind of villain that can go from completely relaxed to psychotic/murderous just cause someone doesn't get what he asked for, but if they do it's all fun and chilled. Phoebe Waller-Bridge as L3-37 was also a highlight, she's absolutely hilarious in the show 'Fleabag' and brings her irresistable charm to Star Wars as a quirky droid fighting for droids' equal rights.A rather distinct visual style, with a varying color palette to keep things refreshing and fit the tone of the place, I especially loved the brown/yellow-ish look of the underground betting club where Lando was first at. This alone i thought already set this movie apart from other star wars movies and made it its own thing, I read Ron Howard worked closely with Bradford Young ('Arrival') to really nail the special look they wanted and it workedAction scenes, they're absolutely fantastic. Really good camerawork, effects, momentum all around, it was always exhilarating to watch. There are two longer, epic setpieces, one involving a train through the mountains and the other the millennium falcon and in my opinion, they're up there with the very best setpieces of the franchise, complete blast. This movie has such a sense of fun and excitement most of the time. There's also a short war scene that felt more like war than anything on this series, loved the atmosphere and intensity thereThe best score the new Star Wars movies have put on. Not on the same level as the OT or the prequels but it brought new interesting stuff to fit in with the ""regular"" Star Wars score these movies have.This makes me sound like I absolutely loved it and I did have a blast overall but why I don't give an even higher rating would be that the story isn't that good, nor is it fully cohesive (noticed a couple spots where the reshoots interfered with the original shoots) but it still works really well on its own, it's solid, I just don't think the material is strong enough. I felt like technically it's impeccable and the characters are loads of fun but this movie is held back by its just solid story and some continuity issues, the connection with the empire vs rebels could have been better established, some other minor issues that are spoilers. But nothing that I really outright disliked.It's a really good movie and I'd recommend to Star Wars fans who are up to watch more Han Solo, more of the Star Wars lore, more thrilling action setpieces and also have a refreshing experience as this movie often feels different from the rest of the franchise. I feel like it earned its existence and is a very welcome addition to the 40-plus-year-old franchise.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

Similarly what I like about this movie is the fact that they clearly put a lot of effort into the acting and the story, and the special effects are more of a supporting element as in the original films.I believe that if you're someone who enjoys the original movies then you'll appreciate this back story. The main character doesn't look like Harrison Ford, but he has a convincing personality and you'll love the flawed and reluctant hero, and loyal friend to Chewbacca all the same.Chewbacca himself is as adorable as ever, and all of the supporting cast are just as great as thier reputations that precede themI really think they struck a great balance with this movie in all respects - no one element stands out as being particularly amazing, but the result is truly greater than the sum of its parts, and the original Star Wars spirit is alive front and center all the way through",Solo - A Star Wars Story

Of course, there is more to a movie than obscure planets mentioned in throwaway lines from the original trilogy. So here's what I liked.I also thought the cast was phenomenal. There seemed to be a lot of concern that Alden would be able to fill Harrison Ford's iconic shoes. He did great! I'm sure people will find things to hate but what are you going to do? Glover as Lando was charming as well and I have no qualms about anyone else either. Except the droid L3 actually really bugged me though, now that I think about it. The story was fairly predictable. I made about 10 predictions about the plot details/twists before seeing the movie. I guessed just about everything correctly, So, like I said, pretty predictable. But I still enjoyed ride! Kudos to Ron Howard for taking the reins on this one after the previous directors were 'let go.'And what good is a Star Wars movie without some cool aliens and monsters? This had quite a few good ones! The set designs and action pieces were fantastic just to look absorb.Also, some bonus points to the movie for cramming 50 easter eggs and references to the prequels, sequels, original trilogy, TV shows, and comics. That's not something that should concern the average movie goer, but for a die-hard Star Wars fan like me it was the icing on the cake.Super fun movie, great acting, Predictable but super fun plot.

There in lies the problem, it didn't matter what situation they put Han and Chewie in, we knew they were going to be OK because they are in the next 5 movies respectively. Without any real tension in the movie the movie just kind of glides along for two hours. ""But Jason!!"" you say..."" there were plenty of original characters in this movie that had completely original backstories"" and you would be very right.... but this movie wasn't called ""Beckett: A Star Wars Story""or ""Qi'ra: A Star Wars Story"" and to be honest none of those side characters were that interesting. Despite the fact that even though I adore Emilia Clarke, she just oozes charisma and has a commanding screen presence. Just not in this movie. Or the legendary Woody Harrelson? C'mon... he is literally one of the best character actors of our generation. Just not in this movie. Seriously, if you couldn't see that Beckett was going to betray Han moments after his character intro then I bestow upon you this advice: stop putting your shoes on before your pants, its much harder that way. By the way, I clicked the spoilers button for all you currently reading this while struggling to get your pants over your shoes.Why did Rogue One work but this one just kind of landed with a thud? Well Rogue one was an interesting story within the established universe with all new and INTERESTING characters. Not a huge Cassian Andor fan, but I loved Jynn Erso and the other characters (Obligatory Donnie Yen shout out!)... they were all fleshed out, even Cassian and when they met their end it was impactful and powerful. Cassian and Jynn sitting on the beach with that mushroom cloud behind them, meeting their ends as heroes, having found a cause beyond themselves put a bit of a frog in my throat. (I had popcorn dust in my eye... I swear!) Solo: A Star Wars story just did not. While I felt that Alden Ehrenreich did a fine job, because lets face it... that poor dude had a giant pair of shoes to fill. He wasn't overly exciting, but he didn't fall on his face like everyone (myself included) thought that he would. Joonas Suotamo has comfortably stepped into the the over sized shoes of the late Peter Mayhew. You honestly can not tell the difference. This movie was just boring to me and very ""meh"". Maybe there would have been an interesting way to tell a Han Solo story, but you should establish something within the universe and make your story fit. Not craft a Story and try to make the universe fit. Maybe something about how Han got indebted to Jabba the Hutt? You could have crafted a finely tuned story about Han smuggling weapons or spice and engaging in a cat and mouse game with the Empire only to get cornered and have to dump his cargo and going on the run. We know that Han is going to dump the cargo, but it would be fun to watch the wily smuggler out wit and dodge the Empires best efforts to capture him only to get to the Tattooine system to have the Empire throw everything they have in that sector at him, seeing Hans face as he watches his cargo float away; knowing that he will spend the rest of his life looking over his shoulder. I don't know, would anyone pay to see that movie? But either way I was completely disappointed with this movie. And I didn't expect much walking into the theater. I tried to watch it on Netflix only to get distracted by a Bob Ross marathon on Twitch.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

The characters are all introduced in an intuitive fashion and each add to the bredth to the film. The pace was very action oriented, with little downtime, yet the film still managed to endear you to the cast given each's unique styles. There is one cameo that was a jaw dropper, if you've been following along with the Star Wars Saga. And, I tell you, this cameo did NOT DISAPPOINT! There were easter eggs throughout that paid homage not only to the original trilogy, but to the prequels as well.Ron Howard hits a home run with this film. It had the same wild eyed adventure and fun experience that I had when I first saw Star Wars as a kid.Seriously, if you didn't like it, you don't deserve to call yourself a Star Wars fan.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

Yes it took turns old fans didnt want, yes it isnt Harrison Ford. What we do get is a movie that easily sits in with some of the better Star Wars. Star Wars for me has always been about the feeling of adventure and just fun. Its what makes me watch them over and over. This movie is that same comfort food. The cast is great and the new Han while different still delivers. The action is memorable and makes for one of the best adventures in the whole series.

I had 2 serious relationships 1 that lasted 6 years and 1 that lasted 2 years. They both chose to leave to pursue a life different from one of growth. This story tells the story of a guy who knows how to survive, learn and be resilient. The acting is perfect. The love story is believable. The logic of the dynamic of how the characters develop into the original trilogy makes perfect sense. I cannot believe people are picking this movie apart. It's perfectly directed by Ron Howard. And the most important thing is that it tells the story of the story's sake. It doesn't tell the conclusion of setting up another movie or trilogy. It's amazing as a standalone film. We're so conditioned as an audience to be left feeling of wanting more that we actually lose the ability to enjoy what we have. And this move makes me appreciate it for what it is while its happening. Its the closest thing to the original trilogy we'll get. It's all character based for the development of the characters not the star wars universe and that actually adds more value to the universe in the long run. Watch the movie and enjoy it for what it is. A tragic love story that makes Han Solo who he is.

I was honestly blown away by this movie.
I was transported away to different planets, it felt like i was part of this wild ride.
Absolutely loved this movie, really keen to see it again.
Well acted. Big shoes to full, I think it was done as well as it could be. Looked like a huge team collaborative effort. 
The actors were awesome. 
I made one or two groans from lines of dialogue from a robot character. Other than that most jokes worked well.
The movie was a visual feast. The creatures and all of the designs awesome, so much detail.
It was fun it was funny and it was serious in parts.
There was some violence. My brother enjoyed the movie but says he won't let his son watch until he is 10.

Han Solo who was always played by Harrison Ford ....i just thought it could not make me feel Han if it was another actor. It surprised me that somehow it did come through. I guess the actor studied every move and gesture. I as a fan missed han solo and specially 'chewie', so i as a fan enjoyed every minute. I think some critics here should stick to the books. I'm from the fans that never liked episodes one, two and three, but loved all the other ones. If you like the retro style of SW you'll enjoy this one. I would give it a 8 or 9, but voted 10 to make some justice to the low rating.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

With Empire Strikes Back and Rogue One, my favorite in the series.As for the movie itself, my opinion is that it's a solid adventure movie, in the style of the great Indiana Jones movies, with lots of fun and intense action, witty dialogues, great humor and solid acting from all actors. Yes, Han must meet a certain Wookie, obtain a certain spaceship and meet a certain curly hair character to maintain coherence with past movies, but the ""necessary"" scenes, even if expected are still brilliantly developed. On top of these scenes, there are several surprising scenes that run the gamut of the best of what the Star Wars universe offers: chases, spacecraft battles, shootouts, aliens galore and lots lots of anti laws of physics split-second solutions.Still, my favorite take from this movie is that they finally managed to shoot an amazing movie that is far from the epic good-evil battles of previous Star Wars movies, and this is completely in tune with the Han Solo character (and, btw, I think Alden Ehrenreich is a perfect match for the role).In summary, if you think the movie is ""unnecessary"" and not needed, it will indeed disappoint you and I would advice you not to watch it, but if you go to watch it with a no-expectations open mind, I think you'll be greatly pleased and much entertained.(and my excuses for any English mistakes; my mother tongue is Spanish)",Solo - A Star Wars Story

1511,carriedragicevic,I surprised myself by liking Solo!,9,28 May 2018,"I'm not the biggest Star Wars fan, generally speaking, but I LOVE Han Solo. Harrison a Ford was my first major crush as a little girl in the 90s, and I was absolutely obsessed with Han. When ""The Force Awakens"" came out (despite understanding the significance of his fate for the plot), I was completely devastated. Han was a huge part of my childhood, and it felt like the entire Disney canon was sullying it. Before seeing ""Solo"", the only saving grace I saw was Donald Glover as Lando - unquestionably perfect casting. But, now that I've seen it, (terrified of my butchery though I was), I really loved it!! Alden Ehrenreich was wonderful as Han, despite having incredibly large shoes to fill. He captured the youthful arrogance and reluctant good-guy qualities so central to the character. This is Han at least ten years before A New Hope. He's more trusting, more optimistic, less sarcastic and caustic. In short, he's younger! You can easily see the man he'll become, but he's not there yet.

I Don't agree with either the low or high scores given on here. Personally it did feel a little rushed and thrown together and perhaps Rob could have done with having the project from the off.

1520,panmpap,A solid adventure in STAR WARS universe,6,20 May 2018,"Let's start by saying that Solo isn't a STAR WARS film with much potential, since it follows a fully-fleshed our character from the Original Trilogy, Han Solo, Chewie a character we have already seen 6 times and Lando, a supporting character in Empire and Return. However, it manages to give us some decent worldbuiling and introduction to the STAR WARS underworlds, some ok humor and characters. It is though predictable at times and it is safe. That isn't necessarily a bad thing since TLJ was bold and I didn't really like it.All in all, it is an enjoyable adventure, but not I my top 5 of Star Wars films",Solo - A Star Wars Story

Clearly they have done it against the wrong movie. I agree that The Force Awakens and Last Jedi are not really all there but this movie; more than, makes up for the disappointment of those 2. This is exactly how a Star Wars movie should be done and EXACTLY what a Solo origin should have been. Support this movie people; go watch it its still in theaters. Its great.

Han and Lando replicate the original actors in some sense.It is also reminiscent of the Mad Max-ish worldview of resource scarcity.Other reviewers seem to lament the absence of Harrison Ford, Darth, lightsabers, andvthe like, but to make up for that, you could find the line ""I have a good feeling about this!""All in all, force awakens> rogue one > Han Solo >> the last Jedi.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

It's got good actors in it, the acting is brill, the visual effects were amazing and the story is good. It's nice to see the darker side to the galaxy and not the glamorous and polished storm troopers and Empire that we all know and love. We appreciate Hans struggle to get where he wants to be in life. Its a slow burner at the start but not to the point you switch off, you're just getting your head around what's happening and why but it builds and builds and is a brilliant film. There's lots of little Easter eggs in there that I appreciated and I'm sure others will too.

1527,guggletterboxd,Solo: A Star Wars Story? More like So Low: A Mediocre Disney Movie.,5,26 May 2018,"It's kind of boring.I went into the film expecting to hate it but instead just got an incredibly average film that just flat lines the whole way through. There are maybe like 1 or 2 scenes that were mildly entertaining but that only goes so far when you aren't invested in anything that's happening on the screen. The film feels very manufactured and is heavily reminiscent of some of the more forgettable Marvel films. It doesn't do anything special but still manages to stay relatively inoffensive the whole way through. Say whatever you want about The Last Jedi but at least that film attempted to take risks. The plot for Solo plays it incredibly safe and just panders towards all the things Han Solo says he did in the original trilogy. Like, Han Solo mentioned he did this! Lets have him do this! Han Solo did (insert original trilogy quip)! Lets have him do that! The constant pandering is just so blatant and really holds the film back, it comes off like the writers were in a constant struggle to try and recapture the essence of what made Han Solo so great. 
There is also hardly any tension in the film either, everything except for the twist near the end was predictable, its kind of hard to care about the safety of 3 out 5 of the main characters when you know they're alive in the OT, it also doesn't help when you don't care about every single other character because their development is non existent. The acting is serviceable for the most part, some positive performances scattered in. Donald Glover is fantastic as Lando Calrissian and was easily my favorite character throughout the entire film. Hes believable and does a great job of capturing the charisma of the original character. Didn't care much for the droid that tags along with him. Alden Ehrenreich is alright and seems to do the best he can with the script but I'm still not overly fully convinced that he was the best choice for a young Han Solo. Emilia Clarke's character doesn't do much and the film ends when interesting stuff with her actually happens, Woody Harrelson's character felt kind of bland and I could care less about that whole crew he had. That guy with lines on his face was compelling but he doesn't do much at all. I literally cannot remember anyone else but I'm sure they also ranged from whatever to alright. I'm not sure what the whole point of shoehorning Darth Maul in the film was? Aside from the obvious reason being that its an obnoxious excuse to set up even more future anthology films. I'm aware that he had been brought back in TCW animated series and that's cool and all but its just so out of place in this film and what makes it worse is that they don't even bother trying to expand on it, instead its left as a confusing and disjointed teaser that's bound to confuse anyone who isn't super invested in the lore. Even as cheap gimmicky shock value, its just so pandering and hollow that it comes off as annoying and a grim reminder that Disney is trying to turn Star Wars into a half baked version of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.Hell, as pointless and insignificant as he was, Darth Maul showing up was probably the most interesting part about the film. It was the only point in the film that peaked my interest and made it feel like it was actually going somewhere interesting, his relation to the gang added intrigue to Emilia Clarke's character and elevated her beyond a blank slate of cardboard. But alas it was short lived and abruptly ends, because hey, got to stretch it out for that new Young Han Solo Trilogy.I think a 5/10 is fair? 
Give it a week or two and I can see myself changing the score to a 4. 
There's no real reason to watch this, even if you're a die hard Star Wars fan.
If you're dissatisfied or unimpressed with the new wave of Star Wars films, then just don't even bother. I highly doubt Solo will be changing any opinions.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

1530,charleskbyrne,Another REAL Star Wars movie at last!,8,25 May 2018,"ONCE AGAIN, an ""anthology"" movie outshines the supposed ""real"" SW Movies!
For those of us who have been asking these origin questions (""How did Han and Chewy first meet?...etc"") since 1977, it delivered in spades! 
Much of the story is what we expected (again, we used to discuss Han and his origins to no end back before Star Wars was called ""A New Hope"" much less ""Episode IV"").... but to actually see it brought to the big screen - ABSOLUTE HEAVEN! And to see it so well done; THANK YOU Ron Howard! Fans of a franchise don't need their movies to be ""edgy"", ""unpredictable"", or sanitized by the PC police. Just deliver what we love and expect, and we're happy! This movie does it in every way possible. Sure, Kathleen Kennedy got her SWJ requirements in, but they didn't draw the spotlight away from the core story as they did in The Last Steaming Pile Called Jedi. Droid L-3 was such an annoyance, it hardly instilled any empathy for her ""cause"" (which actually made it a very realistic representation of it's IRL US counterpart).
Sure, Alden Ehrenreich isn't exactly a Harrison Ford clone, but he holds his own. The rest of the cast was more than capable of filling their roles (and succeeded in doing so), and the plot was just pure, fun, engaging entertainment - placing it beside Rogue One as a TRULY WORTHY heir of A New Hope and Empire!

Their only outlet for showing that dissatisfaction, was to boycott the next Disney Star Wars movie.For that reason, I personally think Solo got bad press it did not deserve and a lot of criticism that was not warranted. The movie was actually pretty good from a cinematic perspective, IMHO. It was a heist movie, set in the Star Wars universe. Think Oceans Eleven.It was never going to be as ""big"" a story as the other Star Wars movies-- the outcome of the film was NOT going to shift galaxies or galactic society. But it was NOT supposed to be! It is just Han Solo's origin story. Some people talk like they thought Han Solo's backstory should have involved some galactic scheme with the Sith and another Death Star or something.If you just watch the movie on its own merits-- I thought it was enjoyable, the acting was good (Woody was great, Han, not as much), the direction added a lot of mood to the movie, and the last thirty minutes of the movie gave it impact and was well executed.I really enjoyed both Star Wars stories (Rogue One may be my favorite SW movie to date).

1538,austindees,Wasn't expecting to enjoy this movie.,8,28 May 2018,"I grew up watching Star Wars. I owned every movie and watched them all over a dozen times, but ever since Disney has purchased the franchise my love for Star Wars has died a lot. Rogue One was mediocre and The Last Jedi is utter garbage, so I wasn't expecting this to be any better. 
I walked into the theater not really expecting to like Ehrenreich as Han, but honestly he was the standout actor. He had enough Han mannerisms to make me believe I was actually watching a young Han. 
The major negative I have with this film is that it's a prequel. By that I mean, no matter the situation, you never feel scared for the 2 main characters of Han and Chewy and that takes you out a bit because you know their fate already. 
All in all, if Disney decided to use this cast, with director Ron Howard, I would watch a whole trilogy about young Han. This movie might have single handily restored my faith in Star Wars.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

I am a die-hard fan having seen A New hope in 1977 at 12 years old. My wife and I were talking on the way to see this movie and we agreed that if we go in with the mindset similar to a James Bond movie that is the criteria. In explanation, the core values of James Bond has to be a part of the actors play otherwise you dont have a 007 movie. So in going to see the movie there has to be the flair, arrogance, scheming, charm, daring, look and mannerisms of Han solo to pull this off.This movie has all of those in the right places, so much so I only saw Han on screen and not the actor. There is the issue, we have all become so enamored with Harrison ford it is, as it was for me, difficult to get past that. However, the movie did it.Go see it for yourself and decide.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
1542,hojjisan,3 Stars... for Joonas Suotamo,3,26 May 2018,"Just got done watching SOLO. I hoped it would at least give me one thing to cheer about... something to take the bad taste out of my mouth left behind by that god awful lack luster fanboy killer Last Jedi Rian Johnson fiasco. Let me start off with the worst part of SOLO. The casting of Alden Ehrenreich as Han. He is painful to watch and a single step above Hayden Christiansen in the record books as worst lead actor in a Star Wars movie. He is more cardboard than cardboard itself. Not once did he invoke a chuckle, a smile, or a fanboy moment. All of those reactions came courtesy of Joonas Suotamo as Chewbacca His portrayal of our favourite Wookie saved every scene were he had screen time. The next big problem with the film... It suffers from ""the Simpsons Did It"" syndrome. (South Park reference there folks) 
SOLO steals the whole ""compassion for smart-ass droid that dies"" from 
Rogue One. It borrows the ""thief that maybe a good guy but stabs the actual good guys in the back"" from The Last Jedi. It even goes as far to use the ""freedom for the oppressed"" from The Last Jedi albeit this time its droids and slaves being freed instead of the weird racing horse things.Having said all that, for what its worth the movie as a whole is kinda alright. It is not going to be anybody's favourite from the series by a long shot, but it is still better than the prequels.In case you're wondering if I did get something to cheer about, I got one word for you... MAUL",Solo - A Star Wars Story
1543,mcorder-2,"Big fan of Star Wars, but not this film",3,25 May 2018,"I've grown up with Star Wars; I was eight when the first film came out. I've seen them all at least 50 times. I'm a die-hard fan, I really am.But not of this film. Yes, it was decent CGI and decent action scenes, but I found it incredibly boring. Boring in the sense that it didn't entertain me like a Star Wars film does. I wanted to like it. No, I wanted to love it and book my return cinema ticket, but I won't be. I don't even feel compelled to watch it on DVD or download it.Alden Ehrenreich did an OK job portraying Han Solo, but he wasn't Han and we knew it. The movie felt like it was a patch-up job to get in all the historical story-lines that we have come to know about Han, which made the actual film less of a story and more of a necessity to put meat on the bones of things that were once magical to us, because we had to use our imagination to ponder how Han met Chewie, what happened with the Kessel Run, how Han won the Falcon from Lando, what did Han do as a smuggler. All those things and more, are now revealed and the magic is gone. For me, none of them were delivered in a great and exciting way and now I wish I could un-see them and stick to my imagination.Another problem with this film which Rogue One didn't suffer from, is that we know the main protagonists, Han, Chewie and to a lesser extent, Lando, all lived on afterwards. So any impending danger and drama that was attempted to be created failed because we always knew they would get past it OK.I think making this film, now that I've seen it, was a poor decision. Maybe because of the execution or maybe because it was better to leave it all to the imagination and allow our own creativity to let us picture forever, what those events might have looked like.It may be harsh to admit it, but this, of all the films, including the prequels, is the one I like the least.I'm as big a fan of Star Wars as the next person, but I'm not a fan of this film, and that is a shame.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

I enjoyed watching it just I enjoy watching the Marvel and DC movies.Maul is back! :-) every fan already knew he survived the bisection in episode 1 (from the animated series Rebels) but is was nice to see him on screen again.

It explained well Hans back story and ties in well with what we already knew.The casting of Han in my opinion was great.
There were times when you could clearly see such a resemblance to Harrison Ford, similar mannerisms and delivery of dialogue.There were great creatures and aliens in the films scenes too.Also, I didnt get bored at the cinema.

I watched the first Star Wars film at the tender age of 11.. I hadn't heard of the film when my parents took me and as such had no expectations, but of course it changed how Hollywood viewed Sci-fi and out paved the way for the success of Aliens, Bladerunner and the like. But do not kid yourself that it was a stunning piece of film making.. most film reviewers panned the film just like all the Star Wars snobs are doing now, this is a fun action movie set in space, and as such should not be vilified for trying to be exactly what the first film was..

The galaxy feels familiar, while doing what Star Wars does by revealing new locations, aliens and characters and providing callbacks to everything from the three trilogies AND Rogue One. The humour is just right and some scenes are so exciting, I don't realise I'm holding my breath until the characters are out of danger.I see a lot of people here and elsewhere saying this film isn't ""necessary"", though I can't seem to get to the bottom of the criteria by which they deem a movie to BE necessary or not.Whatever, throw away any prejudices about the fact we're getting plenty of Star Wars (because that's a bad thing, apparently?) and just enjoy it for what it is; a space western adventure movie that deserves it's place with the rest of the saga.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

1568,cronicchaos-15820,Solo: a good but slow story,4,18 September 2018,"This is a Star wars movie, without lightsabers and the force. The story is good, progression good, pacing so very slow, character development none really, soundtrack could've been better and livelier. Could've been more colourful too, everything was brown. I love Starwars, but it took me 2 days to watch this because I kept falling asleep. I guess this is what we get for wanting a Han Solo origin story, it's nothing like what we thought we'd get. This isn't a story about Han and Chewwy out in space drinking beers and their crazy shenanigans, it's about how Han got the Falcon, it's not even good at that. The little plot twists are nice, the ending was the most rewarding part. Now if they made a sequel to Solo, where we get some serious action and comedy, explosions, lightsabers and stealing with highspeed get aways, that'd be a fun watch.
If you skip this one, you don't miss much, it only links to episode 1, kinda, like by a string, a very thin string that's barely hanging on to anything.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

The prequels were a huge let down and scarred some fans to the point where they are no longer able to objectively assess any new Star Wars material. Sadly, that's what has happened with every Star Wars iteration since The Force Awakens. I went to the cinema with no expectations and an open mind. I was hugely entertained and the movie exceeded all my expectations. It's brilliiant, starting at a cracking pace and continuing in that vain without detracting from character development. Ehrenreich is excellent. He resists the temptation to foolishly impersonate Harrison Ford and instead makes the character his own. At no point did I not believe I was watching a young Han Solo up there on the screen! The story is great- a departure from the usual familiar trappings if the Star Wars universe. This is a fantastic, original adventure that any Star Wars fan should love. Go and see it for yourself and be convinced!",Solo - A Star Wars Story
1570,reagan_mccoy,"Assume This Movie Won't Betray, And You Will Never Be Disappointed",8,28 May 2018,"I have to say, right from the get-go that I thought this movie was a bad idea. What story was there to tell from a few vague lines given in A New Hope? How could they even consider replacing Harrison Ford for the role? With these concerns in mind, I was ready to call this film dead on arrival when all of the behind-the-scenes production drama was revealed. The crazy thing is that somehow this worked, and in my mind proved to be one of the strongest films Disney has produced since acquiring the franchise. Alden Ehrenreich does a convincing job portraying a young Han Solo. His portrayal does not rely on impersonating a character we already know, rather he introduces us to a side of the character that we don't know. He's still cocky, arrogant Han, but we also get to see wide-eyed, optimistic, and trusting Han on the same token. He isn't the Ewan McGregor kind of replacement that everyone would like to see, but those kinds of expectations are rather unreal for this sort of thing. We do however come dangerously close to a near-perfect match up with Donald Glover's role as Lando Calrissian. The smooth-talking scoundrel is portrayed exactly the way you remember him from 1980.The character dynamic is this film is spot on, and real tensions and drama can be felt. All of the characters like each other, get along, but are all cut from the same cloth and are quite aware of each others underlying intentions. In a way, it's kind of like that final standoff scene in Reservoir Dogs, but stretched out through the course of 2 hours. There are quite a few plot twists that do genuinely surprise the audience, and several others that are so predictable and eye-rolling its unreal. The antagonist of this film (if there even is one?) is quite flat, but frankly, I think serves his purpose. There really never is a dull moment in this film and there's definitely some neat surprises that the audience may enjoy.This film in my opinion has kind of broke the corporate mold that has been shaping the Star Wars and Marvel films under the Disney branding. One of those characteristics is the giant amount call-backs and Easter eggs. So far this has been present in EVERY Disney Star Wars film to date, but honestly, in this one its not so bad. They're more subtle and do not tie into the overall story like they do in The Force Awakens, Rogue One, or The Last Jedi. We get it, the late 70's, early 80's were a great time to be alive, but that dead horse has already been beat. It's time to move on that and make new, pleasant memories that people 30 years from now can become nostalgic about. In a film that is solely about one of the most beloved character from that golden era, I'm more understanding and and a little more forgiving of the slight amount of nostalgia stirring here.Another Disney trademark these days is the use of grade school toliet humor (I'm Mary Poppins, y'all!!). Understandably, at its core, Star Wars is nothing more than a kids movie, but even kids I don't think enjoy that sort of thing. Marvel movies have officially lost all value in my eyes because of this sort of thing, and when this cancer spread to my favorite franchise this past December (TLJ), I thought we were done for. With a movie about Han Solo, who yes is one of the funnier characters in the saga, I winced at the thought of the stupid little zingers and bazingas would be present. The thing is though, they aren't there! The film does have some funny moments that are completely natural and flow with the film. One corporate branding that IS a little louder in this one is the SJW undertones, and I really have to ask why. It's heavily insinuated that Lando is in a relationship with his droid, and frankly that's just dumb. I'm not sure what demographic Disney is trying to reach out to here, but there's just really no place for that in the movie. I am 100% for equal representation, but who are they representing??? It's just strange and there's not much else to say about that.The film does set the stage for possible sequels, but I'm not sure how they'll get the ball rolling with that. Avoiding spoilers, there is a cameo from a character that people would like to see reintroduced, just in their own story. It's exciting and I will definitely have no objection with any continuation that may be done with the story, if done correctly.As a whole, this movie isn't as ""divisive"", or ""avant garde"", or as ""challenging"" as some of the other ones. If that's the direction things are going, honestly you can count me out. There's no subjective or far-fetched themes or interpretations to be made here (sorry English professors), rather its just a fun ride that will take you to a galaxy far away for a couple hours! I don't know about you, but that's all I've ever wanted from cinema.-RM",Solo - A Star Wars Story

1573,icepost,Clings like a leech to original trilogy,5,24 May 2018,"Star Wars returns with an all-new cast and tells a stand-alone story with a cowboy and pirate vibe. Sounds good, unfortunately the result is not.To make it short: it's a story about small-time crooks / smugglers who are trying to get out of the business and their bosses. Everybody is pulling jobs, changing sides and trying to double-cross each other. These are nice plot twists but one shouldn't use them like ten times in a single movie. The biggest weakness is the story. It's like someone watched the original trilogy, wrote down everything Han Solo says and does, and wrote the script solely based on that. Everything we knew about Han is crammed into few days: Lando, Chewie, Falcon, Kessel run, his blaster... There's only a few ""new"" elements in the story and they're very bland.Casting is ok. Actors do a pretty decent job. Alden Ehrenreich and Donald Glover don't feel like Han and Lando I used to know, but this didn't bother me. Woody Harrelson plays just Woody Harrelson, Paul Bettany plays Paul Bettany with some scars on his face. Once again, cinematography and the special effects are great. Action sequences are long, dark and noisy. Too bad that the action is not exiting at all. It feels more like the Pirates of the Caribbean movies: everybody's shooting, jumping and swinging all the time and none of the good guys get hurt.The humour didn't work for me. There's a lot of jokes and banter going on but I didn't laugh once. Nor did the rest of the audience at the movie theater. Few ""adult jokes"" were cringeworthy.There are no jedi, the force, or hardly even the empire involved, so the movie has to remind the audience that it's a Star Wars movie. ALL the time. Fan service is all over the place. There's some kind of nod to the original movies (or expanded universe) literally every minute.Few positives:
There were no forced C-3PO & R2-D2 cameo.The explosion at the end of the railway sequence was cool.Few negatives:
The Kessel run -plot was shoe horned and poorly written. It should be about the Falcon, not it's clever pilots. The eccentric droid was WAY out of line.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

I didn't think it was possible to make a worse movie than The Last Jedi but they have succeeded. Solo is an abomination of a Star Wars movie. So boring. Some of the the worse writing I have come across in a movie. Very lazy and by the numbers.. We also now have a more annoying character than Jar Jar in L3 37. There wasn't a single scene I found interesting or original. The acting was awful with not one person standing out.

I'll keep my review nice and short. The story was really entertaining and very interesting toward the end. It was a ton of fun to see Han's back story and how he met certain people like Chewy and Lando. It makes me want to go back and rewatch episode 4-6. The acting and character development were great. This was clearly a story to introduce some new characters and lead to a more in depth story. I think a lot of people don't realize that. If you read a lot of books you know that book 1 is never the authors intended story. It always leads to something greater in the upcoming books. This movie left me excited and wanting to see where the story is going to go. It was kind of long at times but seriously what movie isn't these days. My advice, go see the movie yourself.

It never felt like true Star Wars, as it shouldn't really, because the plot isn't central to any of the trilogies.As a standalone flick, the casting and acting was good, the action scenes weren't overdone and the film did fill in some of the blanks to Han Solo's famous exploits.The L3-37 (LEET = elite, in internet speak, apparently) droid's personality and actions left me feeling blank. Completely.Rogue One set the bar very high for standalone films
Did this film need making? Perhaps, it does have it's moments and charm.
 
Do we need a Boba Fett or Obi Wan film? No, not for myself, i'm pretty sure these characters have had enough screen time already.
An Obi Wan film might have a bit of mileage to it. To sum up, Solo is worth a watch at some point.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
1579,stehan-14703,How can you NOT like this?,8,6 June 2018,There seems to be a lot of people flaming this flick. Not sure why. I dare anyone to compare it to the original three. All were formulaic and goofy at times. But they were all lovable for various reasons. This one is no different. It hits all the important story points and has enough drama to keep you excited....if you have an open mind. Certainly better than the last one with the Princes Leah doing the outer space Marry Poppins act. And better than all three done between 1999 and 2005. Personally I think Ron Howard did a very good job. I may see it twice in the cinema. It was worth it. Took two stars away because the only thing that others had this seemed to miss was drama building at multiple levels at the same time and how they all come together to get resolved. This one seemed to be very linear with the drama building sequences. Could have been more complex.,Solo - A Star Wars Story

1582,losermcgee,"Slow start, but ultimately a lot of fun once you get into it",7,4 June 2018,"Is Solo: A Star Wars Story a great Star Wars movie? No. But more importantly it's a fun one. That is what the originals were designed to do, and what the best of the new Star Wars, The Force Awakens, are successful from. Yes, the first act, is terrible, and I mean really terrible. People get pissed at Rogue One for not having scrolling credits, well this film not only doesn't have them, it has the perfect introductory statements that should be in the scrolling credits but for some reason are in the same font and style as the ""galaxy far, far away,"" statement. Then the actual title of the movie is integrated into the action of the movie, in a way that is supposed to be cool, but ends up being dumb and you will roll your eyes at it. Qi'ra is a very typical female love interest with nothing interesting or new in this part of the movie too, which is surprising considering how well structured and original of a character she is in the rest of the movie. Most of the creatures in the first act look like Muppets as opposed to actual Star Wars characters. It includes a bland heist scene with barely any originality to it, and a team made of pointless characters who literally have no purpose in the film. It gets caught up in being an origin story, which really doesn't work because of the origin story fatigue caused by superhero movies thats been going around lately. This film is at it's best when it feels like the middle episode of a season. Enough with the bad, though. Let's move on to the good. Pretty much the best thing about the movie is Donald Glover's Lando. The humor and comic relief of this character is constantly present and Glover presents it perfectly. The performance he gives is one of the best seen in the Star Wars franchise when considering who he is living up to. I would also like to praise Alden Ehrenreich as Solo. He has the perfect kind of charisma needed for the character. He makes the movie fun and enjoyable as a perfect follow up to Harrison Ford's Han Solo. All in all it was these two actors and characters that made the film have that ""fun"" I talked about earlier. However this film has one other major problem. It is completely and utterly forgettable. It's one of those movies, where you walk out of the theater saying, ""That was good. Wait, what happened in that movie again?"" This is strange because it is not a feeling I have felt with Star Wars before. Even the bad ones, I remember everything I hated. Besides those two actors, I can't really remember what I loved, but besides the first act, I don't know what I hated. All in all Solo is a decent Star Wars film with flaws, but it is undeniably a fun ride.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
1583,robkengar,Ignore the bad reviews...This is an entertaining movie!,8,29 May 2018,"For all the negative hype surrounding this movie, it was good. In some ways its superior to ""The Last Jedi"" and ""The Force Awakens"" Unlike ""Last Jedi"", There're no gaps of logic (bombers...in space!?!?) and none of the screen time is wasted on a long and ultimately counterproductive side-plot. There're no awful revelations that upend everything we knew about the Force and there're no beloved characters acting entirely out of character. And though ""Solo"" has a stupid title and is slightly parasitic, it's not nearly as derivative as ""The Force Awakens"". I mean, at least it isn't practically a shot by shot remake of a George Lucas classic.The actor playing Han Solo did a fine job...he tried a little too hard at times, but c'mon, none of this is Shakespeare. Emilia Clarke's performance was nuanced and deep (continuing the tradition of fascinating female characters in this new era of ""Star Wars"") and Woody Harrelson and Paul Bettany were the dependably good professionals that they are.

It wasn't the best entry I'm the Star Wars universe, but it's certainly not the worst. Alden does a solid job as Han. He won't be winning any awards for his Harrison Ford impression, but it's really not too bad. Paul Bettany and Woody Harrelson, as with everything they're in, are both very enjoyable to watch, as is Emilia Clarke. This movie is pretty much your classic origin story. You see where he finds Chewbacca, how he meets Lando, and of course the game where he wins the Falcon. I found it all very fun to watch and I think I'll definitely go for a second viewing. Also, there is a surprise appearance at the end, but don't get your hopes up for it to be Obi Wan. However, I want to keep this pretty spoiler free, so I won't mention who it is. Anyway, it is a fun movie to watch and I would recommend it, but don't expect to be watching Harrison Ford, and you should be fine. Go with an open mind.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
1587,trevir-50147,Was Better than I Thought...,7,23 June 2018,"Finally went to see Solo in his first...solo. I had reservations going in (1) I had heard ticket sales were sub par. (2) I questioned the casting of the lead role (we'll get to that later). I tried to keep an open mind to let the film stand on its own merit. It was a pretty solid summer sci-fi action film that had some laughs with some likeable characters that reasonably fits in the Star Wars mythology. The movie was predictable in the sense that it's a prequel and many points of story progression are predetermined. That being said, these points are woven into a story that flowed well that I actually had fun watching. This movie is a solid 7. My biggest reservation was and is Alden Ehrenreich. His depiction of Han Solo is not terrible but is rather dry and lacks the charm and wit of his predecessor Harrison Ford. We can't help but make that comparison and those are tough shoes to fill. I was admittedly jaded going in as there is a Star Wars fan film on YouTube called Han Solo: A Smuggler's Trade where the actor is the personification of a young Harrison Ford. He captures all the nuances and mannerisms of Han Solo and his depiction is on point. If there are any sequels to this prequel, maybe Ehrenreich can grow into the role and own it.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
1588,dsgreeninc,Great movie that gets too much hate for no reason,10,12 August 2018,"This is an awesome movie. The characters are great, the new Han Solo is great, Paul Bettany is great, Woody Harrelson is great, Emilia Clarke is great.

1589,lancehuffman-96106,Decent storyline.... but you wanna know how to ruin the best franchise in the world? Politicize it!,2,12 September 2018,"I enjoy Star Wars, a lot. But the last 4 movies have been so lazy, and it's annoying. I'm starting off with what I liked. I liked seeing Maul there. I liked the music. I like the settings. I liked the Kessel run. What I didn't like? Pretty much everything else. Let's start with the girl, Kyra. She grows up on Corellia with Han, and Han loves someone? That doesn't make sense. It would make sense if it was a different universe, but Han didn't have an affection for anyone in 4! He was in it for the money. The whole team basically got wasted even though they really struggled to get decent screen time. After Kyra got carptured, how the hell did she break out? We know she was captured, and possibly put in prison, but did she use her ""woman powers of the Star Wars Mary Sue"" to break herself out and land into the enemy hands. Then we have this whole ""the enemy is really our friend, and our friend is really our enemy"" cliche. Now let's get into something that I find to have ruined the franchise. One way to ruin Star Wars, like I said in the title, is to politicize it. You want to add a droid that was made by humans that can express human thoughts? That doesn't add up! If all fans are supposed to enjoy it, then why are you making this so controversial? I would also like to take a moment and just scream at Disney. They made Lando Calrissian, acted by Billy Dee Williams in the OT, who is a straight person who not have allowed this to happen, became pansexual out of the blue. So they made my favorite character out of Star Wars into a person who gets turned on by everything?! This makes me miss George Lucas so much. I wish he never let Disney take over,and I never wish he gave any of this to Kathleen. DISNEY, DO YOU WANT FANS TO ENJOY THIS?

Chewy was there but you never really see him exert his full physical potential often. This movie fills that void I'd always had about how violent he can be and strong he is. And other details about him that were never previously revealed. This movie is worth the price of the ticket just for that. Next. Donald Glover is the only possible Lando after Billy Dee; I cannot imagine anyone else in the role! Glover has the 'it' factor that can't be taught in drama class. I cannot wait for additional installments with Lando because Glover will ensure we see the swiftest, custom-cape wearing cool-breeze this side of the galaxy.Next, I think they could've developed the relationship with Han and Qi'ra; I'd say 10 minutes more in the beginning.

The storyline in this film helps the viewer get a decent backstory on Hans' life, even where his last name 'Solo' came from. The aspect that I thought should have not been included in this story and lacked is in the very beginning of the movie. For one thing, the Hans Solo logo/title was strait out of a Marvel Comics movie and did not hold true to the penultimate feeling that one would feel when the opening credits began with the main titles theme behind it. I understand that they are turning a new leaf with the series, but that does not change the fact that there needs to be consistency if they claim that this is under the Star Wars franchise. This problem alone hurt the ending for me, because it almost felt like a let down, not really leading anywhere.

1610,deslaughton,"Very entertaining, likeable, morally ambiguous characters, overly gloomy cinematography.",9,30 June 2018,"I found myself buying into the premise of the story more, as the film progressed. I thought all the actors did well, and liked their performances. Not a single bad note, in the acting side of the movie. The actors playing Han and Lando got it right, Woody Harrelson had fun, and I had fun watching him, and I thought Emilia Clarke's flawed, broken but adorable anti-heroine may just be my favorite Star Wars female character now. I was squinting somewhat for the first half hour or so, because of the darkness of the cinematography - I've noticed this trait at least since Tim Burton came on the scene (e.g. Batman, 1989) and I don't like it, or see the point, of scene after scene of gloomy, hard to see sets. For that reason alone, not a perfect 10, but I was thoroughly entertained nonetheless.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
1611,nijuel,"Don't believe the ""Hate""",9,5 July 2018,"Hello people. Looky-here. You will find no shortage of people who hate on the Solo movie. They have their reasons- a.). It wasn't a real Star Wars story
b.). The acting was bad
c.). The actor didn't bring the same level of swagger to the role that Harrison Ford did.
d.). It wasn't as good as the expanded universe books.This could not be further from the truth. Was the movie predictable? Yes, in spots. But, aren't all movies predictable to a certain extent? There's a formula that works, and everyone seems to follow it, making every movie somewhat predictable.Did the lead have the same swag-factor as Harrison Ford? Heck no. Then again, who does? The lead actor had about 90% of Harrison's swag. This is not bad for a film where a legendary character is being re-created.""The acting was bad""- Sorry, I have to call ""BS"" on that. The acting was great- and aside from Rogue One, Solo- was the grittiest movie in the Star Wars Franchise. It was not ""kiddie softened"" mush. Even kids had to ""man-up"" to see this film. The acting was spectacular.Was it as good as the book?- I am so tired of hearing that crap. I've read several books that became movies- and do you know how many were as good as or better than the book? ZERO. Do you know why? The reason why movies never live up to the book is two fold. First and foremost is budget. Even Disney has to watch their budget. The second reason is- imagination. When we read books, we visualize what is happening in our minds. We visualize the fights, the chases, the explosions, the tone of the dialogue, and more. When we see the movie- we end up seeing what someone else has visualized. Those two interpretations will rarely- if ever- match... Those of you who think this way- well, get over it... It's rarely going to even come ""close"" to anyone's expectations...Overall, you already kinda know how this is going to go. You get that because you know Han's story. However, that doesn't mean the movie isn't worth seeing. It is...I actually liked this ""Solo"" more than I did ""The Force Awakens""... If you enjoyed the Force Awakens, but turned your nose up at this movie/ you sir, ma'am, might be a hypocrite... Maybe...",Solo - A Star Wars Story

The whole thing was unessecary but it was good, I'm glad this wasn't a dissapointment like many people thought it would be
The dude who plays Han Solo did really well at his part and he did a great/ almost perfect representation of Han Solo and what he would be like if he was young

Storyline was good and it is obviously answers questions like how did Han get the Falcon , and how he met Chewie , and also the start of the rebel alliance (maybe) . As for reviewers on here giving it 1/10 , that is just absolutely absurd and they obviously have an ulterior motive for giving it that score . I would say to anyone looking at the reviews ignore the 1/10 scores and look at the reviews that are sensible . It's decently acted , the action scenes aren't ott (something I hate , think Transformers for that)and storyline is fluid .

1616,SomeWorldWSuchThat,Legitimately terrible writing.,1,16 October 2018,"Let's say you wanted to play a drinking game with this movie: For each wildly implausible coincidence that the writers use to move the narrative forward, take a shot. Do. Not. Play. This. Drinking game. You'd black out within the first 45 minutes. Deus ex machina was apparently taken as a golden rule, rather than as a cheap trick, by the screenwriters.The characters are flat, uninteresting, and bizarrely inhuman. Friends die with no recognition whatsoever; spouses are killed tragically, and buddy-buddy jokes are cracked within minutes (of in-world time, not film time); the writers try to rouse our emotions for last-minute character additions simply on the basis that we're told that these people were hurt by others; and so on.To top it all off, the movie obviously panders in the worst way to fans of the genre, by packing in as many references to (and explanation of) dialogue in the original films. It's entertaining to think that Han Solo's references were all to the same brief span during which he was looking for his girlfriend; I guess he was actually kind of blase about his life after that point. Hauling coal or something. Eh.Pandering, insultingly mind-numbing, and dull.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

It was good start to finish without any of those dull rabbit hole moments that some films suffer from. Everything that was there contributed to the story. 
 A lot of reviews didn't give Alden Ehrenreich a stellar mention, however I think he was cast quite well for this movie and did an admirable job in recreating the personality of a YOUNG Hans Solo. Harrelson has become one of the best all time character actors in the business and did another great job in this movie. They left it open for a sequel and I look forward to seeing it if they make it.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
1618,shroombutter,It's fun!,7,17 September 2018,"Solo is just good fun. I enjoyed it throughout and left it pleasantly surprised. Now, I am not a die-hard Star Wars fan, but I have seen them all and for the most part enjoy them. Solo fits nicely into the mold of the new wave of films by Disney and I think it caters nicely to a new generation of fans. It seems that many of the older Star wars fans are generally pissed off about the direction Disney has been taking these films, but that's something that they just need to get over. Star Wars is over 40 years old now, and like anything, it's subject to change and adapt to the times. Solo does this changing/adapting well and honestly exceeded my expectations. It's pretty much a heist movie, and there's not a whole lot more to it. Solo teams up with some peeps to steal some stuff. He meets Chewy in the film and I think it's pretty awesome the way that it's handled. There's great action and ridiculous over-the-top last minutes escapes. There's romance and a whole lot of comedy, because it's Han Solo yo! He's a wise-cracking, witting man. The cast is great. I liked Ehrenreich as Solo. Emilia Clarke is great, so is Woody Harrelson. Donald Glover as Lando and Waller-Bridge as Phoebe is a terrific pairing. Some of the funniest moments came from these two. All in all, Solo is a nice, fun Star Wars film that I would absolutely recommend to any Star Wars fan (even the grumpy ones) and anyone looking for an entertaining action film. It's not perfect and the very ending will surely throw many people off, but for me more Star Wars is always a good thing.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

1620,Tocratis,Adds nothing of note,4,6 January 2019,"The best thing I can say about this movie is that it is slightly better than ""The Last Jedi"".It feels like a movie that wasn't needed - a desperate cash grab on the ""Solo"" name that only serves to weaken the character we see in the OT, rather than enrich the story.As a movie, it is entertaining enough to hold interest for a couple of hours. The acting is decent, with Woody Harrelson the standout as you might expect. But the references to the other movies feel very forced. The name ""Solo"" is as iconic in the Star Wars universe as ""Skywalker"", but they even manage to take that away from him by having a random Imperial officer come up with it, as for some reason he never needed a surname before we meet him in the movie. There were many face-palm moments like that.I'm not surprised this movie failed to deliver the box office returns Disney expected. They ruined the character in TFA, turning him into a deadbeat dad that was a shadow of the Rebel hero we knew from the OT. And it's difficult to see how the version in ""Solo"" becomes the guy we know and love. Where's the continuity?",Solo - A Star Wars Story

The special effects, cinematography, humor and story line were quite good, although I did feel the musical score was a bit lacking, that to from a Ron Howard product. I don't think the casting was the best, but that was far less concerning than the lack of depth attributed to the story line of the 'marauders'. I did like the nods to the other Star Wars films, and a mention of a building of a rebel alliance - that was cool. What I liked most is it was not textbook, and was surprisingly mature - not too much cheese that other Star Wars films are plagued with. I do recommend this over the Last Jedi.

Han Solo acts like Marvel's Star-Lord, who was in fact partly inspired by Han Solo himself, but it really doesn't work. This is really out of character for him to act this way.The way they just glance over the infamous Kessel run and degrade it to a bland uninteresting scene of an ordinary hyperspace jump.The idiotic way Disney and Hollywood in general hint at older movies by throwing an out-of-place catchphrase or trigger word in totally unfitting moments and have characters smile or wink to nod at the reference, as if that is somehow smart or entertaining to anyone who has evolved past the category of the homo erectus.Emilia Clarke is expressionless for the most part, as if she's telling us ''I'm a big personality, I don't have to act! lol!''The way Han gets his ''Solo'' surname. Paint me purple and call me Susan but THAT WAS JUST WRONG.The characters (save for Lando) are ALL uninteresting.The actor for Han is a really weird choice.TL;DR, Don't bother watching this.

But, honestly, the word ""Solo"" only truly belongs on the marquee above a cinema showing the underappreciated 1996 classic, with Van Peebles commanding the screen in the film ""The Terminator"" wishes that it was.The fact that ""Solo"" got lost in the shuffle late in a summer with big-ticket blockbusters like ""Twister"" and ""ID4"" doing better business is a shame enough; it seems to be adding disrespect to now, 20 years later, be re-using the title, even if it does have the 'StarWars' name tagged onto it.

breaking it down - non of the characters are very interesting....maybe chewie... and at no point do you think you are watching han solo. if your a superfan then you have to watch it, like me, just to have seen it. if your not much of a fan, and much younger then the average starwars fan you'll probably enjoy it more.
now the part that baffled me the most. at the end of the movie darth maul makes an appearance. now, we know that darth maul was the bad guy in the first prequal. the same movie that introduced us to a very young anakin skywalker. so by this we're supposed to understand that han is around 35 years older the luke an leah?

1658,nicki92,Delightfully suprised...,9,26 May 2018,"I went into this film expecting a mediocre (at best) SW film.
This, due to the known production problems... firing the director(s) and bringing in Ron Howard. Though Howard is excellent so maybe he can save it?
Add to that, rumors of having to bring in an acting coach for the lead actor, and I was ready for nothing special.
Though, I am a huge SW fan so there's no way I wasn't going to see it in the theater.That being said... this movie was fantastic!
Whatever they paid this supposed acting coach was money well spent, because after the first 20 minutes, he totally nailed what you would imagine a young Han Solo to be like. He had just enough of the manerisms (physical and verbal) to fit the part almost perfectly. Well done. The rest of the cast was mostly superb. Clark played her part adequately and was lovely as always. Harrelson was excellent in his (dubious) mentor role. All the smaller roles felt perfectly in flow with the story. The biggest standout may have been Glover's portrayal of Lando. It was almost to good. Almost every scene he was in, you half expected to see Billy Dee pull off the Glover mask to reveal it was really him underneath.The story is mostly cowboy/heist territory. 
This isn't normal Star Wars fare, but it was perfect Han Solo fare. 
This movie could have easily been sub-titled ""Scum of the Galaxy"". 
When everyone's a criminal, no one can be trusted... a theme which plays out repeatedly in the film. 
The Han/Chewie bromance is beautifully done, as is the Han/Lando bro-hate-mance. Clark's Qi'ra starts out seeming to be a typical female sidekick/romantic option for Solo, but she develops very interestingly as the film pushes into its final act (the near-end is jaw-dropping).Overall, the movie is a very fun ride. It also (retro-actively) puts to bed the complaint that ""12 parsecs is a distance, not a unit of time"" problem, in a very clever way.Of course, I would be remiss if I didn't say something about (among numerous smaller easter eggs) the biggest surprise in the whole film... 
If A = B, which A obviously is, then any sequel will have to include either C or D, because who else (in this time period) could possibly deal with A?

""How could A be B?"", you ask.
Think about it... a lightsaber caused A to be assumed non-B, but a lightsaber (right at the waist) would have preserved all the organs in the upper half (while instantly cauterizing the wound), meaning, as long as A got serious medical attention in the next 24 hours to do a work-around to the sudden non-ability to *ahem* evacuate waste, A's life was perfectly viable.And as far as falling down a deep shaft... Luke survived such a scenario near the end of 'Empire' to escape Vader, and A was far better trained at the time of his 'fall'. 
He could have used the force to manipulate himself toward a vent (like Luke did) or toward a ledge, or slowed his fall etc...Rewire his lower digestive system and slap a couple cyborg legs on him and he's good to go :)",Solo - A Star Wars Story
1659,whitetigerspace,What is wrong with people? This was an excellent film.,9,27 May 2018,"I loved all the actors. Obviously, accepting Alden Ehrenreich as Han takes time. He is a superb actor. Emelia is not just lovely, she adds the appropriate tones at each moment. Donald Glover delivers. I have nothing to say to the naysayers except that something seems broken in them as viewers. The nuggets left along the way were exciting. Complaining about the obviousness of the plot is like complaining the sky is blue. Did everyone not know the outlines would have to be as they are? The cast was perfect IMHO. In many ways, this was a sentimental film, something the current generation/s are not prepared for. Perhaps people will believe this is a wonderful film as everyone has time to adjust. And stop dissing on Woody.

Not to mention, that he doesn't really nail Han's mannerism. I actually like the actor too but he just isn't right for this role.

Solo is a snapshot in the timeline that should be openly embraced and once seen, loved. I get it, there might be some that find moments in the film you might not appreciate, that's understandable. I thought Solo and Lando were captured brilliantly. The story is fun and foundation building.

1694,tajbromley,Arguably the best Star Wars film since 1983,9,7 June 2018,"Having sat through the horrendous Episode VIII recently this was like an apology from the Star Wars franchise. It can be a little lacking at times, but that's partly due to the constriction of being characters we know have to get somewhere and having to fit into the lore but it's a great, fun, Star Wars film, like Star Wars should be.Donald Glover is getting all the headlines for his portrayal of Lando but Alden E's Han Solo deserves so much more credit, his mannerisms and swagger are bang on and the voice isnis far off, it feels like Han Solo, and that's all that matters. Chewie is also excellently performed. Peter Mayhew will be proud.Emilia Clarke is perhaps underused but is good, and Woody Harrelson and Paul Bettany are also fantastic throughout.Phoebe Waller Bridge as L3 is a better sarky robot than K2SO and has some great lines, although there are a few strange moments with her but that's minor spoiler territory.Comparing it to recent Star Wars films, it's lacking that little hint of magic VII had due to not having Carrie, Harrison and Mark but I feel like overall it's a better and more enjoyable film than VII and definitely VIII. Rogue One is darker and if you like that then I imginei you'll prefer that to Solo, but they are both fantastic films and arguably better Star Wars films than the main episodes.It's well directed and written too, with the Kasdan name attached and supplying something that really feels true to Star Wars.There are a few dodgy special effects shots at the beginning (I'm guessing a late addition after the well publicised production issues) but they are vastly outnumbered by some fantastic effects work. The Falcon has never looked better.One thing I will say is that it seems like Star Wars is borrowing back some things from other media that borrowed from it, there's an alien on the yacht that is almost scarily like Liara from Mass Effect, and there are a few Horizon Zero Dawn and Destiny esque things, but it doesn't detract from this being a fantastic film and a return to form for Star Wars after the dire Episode VIII",Solo - A Star Wars Story

1700,sarah-grace-sanford,This movie is bad.,2,6 June 2018,"To be quite honest, there are no redeeming qualities to this movie. I have a cat named Leia. I am in the process of getting a Star Wars tattoo. I've loved Star Wars since I was born. This movie has, withholding all exaggerations for attention, almost (italics, /almost/) ruined the Star Wars franchise. The clear and unapologetic pandering and fan service (that I am usually okay with, when done well) shows that the new Disney Star Wars wants only one thing: your money. This movie is so bad, it won't even get that.
I think the potential behind this movie could have made it something incredibly unique. When the film starts, you see the young Han speeding away from a group of officers chasing after him. He doesn't look back. The vibe felt almost Cowboy Bebop to me. In the theater, I got excited. ""So that's the vibe we're going for!"" Think about it, that sounds awesome. Solo is a space cowboy. And even if the film didn't follow such a formula to the exact degree, the vibe, color, emotion, and nostalgic aura of the very opening scene created something that made me think ""maybe this won't be so bad"".
But, I was wrong. What followed was a sloppy, dimly lit bore of an adventure that had me asking more questions (questions such as ""why do I care about this character, again?"" or ""what are the stakes? If there are any?"") than getting as excited as I was at the very beginning.
I understand necessary scenes, I understand adding certain characters (I actually quite liked Han and Chewie's meeting... until Ehrenreich started to speak Wookie with an impression worse than my older brother's). Personally, I do not think anyone is upset about the necessary fan service. What people are upset about is the handling of this fan service. When given characters so dearly loved, so understood, it almost seems like it's impossible to fail. The blueprints, the bones, the heart is there.
And yet I found no heart whatsoever. Every performance, even from actors I respect (Harrelson, Glover, Bettany) were terribly flat, but I don't blame them for that. It was just like watching actors like Ewan McGregor, Christopher Lee, Samuel L. Jackson, Natalie Portman, even Hayden Christensen (who had honest performances in movies outside of Star Wars) in the prequels. The talent behind movie (even THE Lawrence Kasdan has writing credits for this film, if you can believe it) is wasted because of the hands of the studio not knowing what to do with Star Wars anymore. Following in Rogue One's footsteps, Solo was destined for changes that would ruin any source of novelty the moment it was thought up in the Disney drawing room.
I went into Solo: A Star Wars Story with low expectations. I left disappointed still. Star Wars holds a particularly special place in my heart, but with every major decision being made in the recent franchise (save The Force Awakens), the flame is slowly dying out.
There's no excuse for this movie's existence. Skip it, if you want to keep any hope for Star Wars alive.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

1717,johnlclarke22,Average at best,4,10 January 2019,"They missed SO many opportunities to make this easily great.
Han was a naïve romantic, which doesn't add up. Did he have to be the same person as he was/is in the original Star Wars Movies? No, of course not, but this guy is a different character completely. In fact, Emilia Clarke's character played a better Han...trusting but with a hidden agenda, caring but cautious, disarmingly dangerous...she is the character Han should've been.The way that Chewie and Han met and bonded was also awkward and forced.The original story of Han saving Cheeie and then Chewie raising Han was way more compelling and you understood the bond.The story of how he became a smuggler thru Beckett wasn't really interesting. Woodys character didn't fit either. He should've been cold with hint of warmth. Instead, he seemed trusting and then would preach otherwise. Pick a persona Woody.Lastly, the quick back story of Han in the Imperial army was also shoved awkwardly in the story. It didn't have to be a big moment, but there could've been a more poignant arc...something like he was good at killing and or flying but his conscience for the better of him.Overall, the story was okay, the acting was okay and the effects were okay.Huge missed opportunity on a favorite character that could've been easily told.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

1719,gordonabarrie,"A reasonably good ""movie""",5,13 July 2018,"In my opinion, this is a reasonably enjoyable film in itself and has lots of east eggs (some obvious and some unnecessary). The film starts off slowly and feels very different compared to any other Star Wars movie, with the imperial academy advertised in a comedic and annoying fashion, (in my opinion even Rebels did a better job) later though the film begins to take shape however is generally boring and audience interest is kept mainly by references to the other Star Wars masterpieces such as Han getting his blaster, Han meeting chewie, Han meeting Lando, Han getting the falcon etc. There lies what I think is the main problem with this film; in filling in the backstory which was cleverly teased in episodes 1-3 you force it to become something which may not appeal to a vast amount of the fan base who have already built up an idea of what THEY imagined it to be through clever dialogue and interactions in the originals. The ending of the film is probably the best part with Darth Maul showing up in a hologram and some interesting twists, however overall I feel this movie is a complete cash-grad with little effort put into the fundamentals of it. As a film in itself, I would rate this a 7.2, however as part of the Star Wars cannon, especially as this- unlike the sequels doesn't change what comes after the originals, which people can simply pretend don't exist if they so wish; THIS forces its own history cannon and therefore I rate it a 3 as part of Star Wars.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

What he did was nice though. He cut out the kiddie jokes and made a film with a solid storyline, likeable characters, a bit of dry humor and he had a cast that can act.

I don't claim to be a big Star Wars guy. I've seen all the movies multiple times, but I don't get into the history or politics of it outside of what is shown on the big screen. The new trilogy is keeping my interest and Rogue One felt unnecessary, but Solo has to be the most in-spirit Star Wars film since Return of the Jedi.It was a heist film, a Spaghetti Western, a buddy comedy, and a sweeping romantic epic all in one - all with more double-crosses in a third act than a Tarantino film. The acting was superb (whether you like Ehrenreich's take on Han or not, he gives it everything he's got with going overboard), and there are some great moments for the up-and-coming actors to shine.Ron Howard does a great job chewing the scenery and showcasing the wonder of a franchise that hasn't been seen in ages. The movie is not without problems, and (like Rogue One) you can't jump into this films as a Star Wars starting place - it can't stand on its own, but the complaints are minimal.

I watched the trailers and it eventually got me interested, but I still went in with low expectations after the mess that was The Last Jedi. I can thoroughly say I was pleasantly surprised. I thought all the actors did a great job and really liked Woody Harrelson's character. The first act of the film was brilliant and I would've scored this review much higher if the next two acts were similar, although they weren't terrible. The action scenes were handeled really well and were exciting! I found the pacing to be phenomal as well. I don't understand why people said they became bored during the film? I found it to be very fast paced and when the action slowed down I was still interested in the characters interactions unfold on screen. The only major gripe I have with the film was towards the end. A certain character cameo comes out of nowhere. It's also way to over the top and doesn't make much sense. I also wasn't really a fan of the SJW robot L3, but she wasn't too overwhelming and didn't affect my experience. Last thing I want to mention: I think Alden played a great Han Solo.

Side note he also wrote Empire Strikes Back, Raiders of the Lost Ark and a few other small films - catch the sarcasm? Speaking of which, Solo reminded me in many ways of Raiders of the Lost Ark and yes - Alden Ehrenreich was in fact Han Solo. The pacing of this movie was perfect, the score was beautiful, especially the love theme for Qi'Ra -- just gorgeous. Wooooooooooo!!!Okay, I may be on a Star Wars high at the moment! Crazy enough, I actually really hope to see some sort of sequel to this movie which follows Han and Chewbacca. That's how much I bought Ehrenreich as Han and Chewie as well Chewie. Go check it out - give Solo chance! Oh!

1734,hungryboyjoe,Best of the new batch,8,26 May 2018,"I'm a huge Star Wars fan who's been a bit disappointed with the recent films. They've had good moments but not held together that well.
Force Awakens was my favourite but it felt like a remake.
Rogue One was darkly promising but remove a couple of scenes and it was pretty boring apart from the nostalgia.
Last Jedi was very frustrating so close to being brilliant but was trying too hard and ended up falling short.
That leads into Solo. For me as a stand-alone film it has the best script, acting & Direction. The impossible task of playing a young Harrison Ford was admirably achieved. 
Links well with original Star Wars without being derivative or cheesy. Exciting throughout without loads of Jedi waffle filler.
The styling & art direction is as awesome as the original. That perfect mix of futuristic sci-fi with dust dirt and natural materials. 
And finally the scale was similar to the original, that intimate grit of the plucky heroes that setup the awesome scale of the Empure. something that failed, for me, so badly on the prequels.Overall Solo is a good film and succeeded where other new Star Wars has failed. Ron Howard has made the most complete and well crafted Star Wars of them all. However I think some hardcore fans will miss the cheesiness and Jedi fantasy.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

Star Wars holds a lot of nostalgia for me, but I'm not a super fan now. I haven't gotten involved in the expanded universe. I skipped seeing Solo in theaters because I was exceptionally busy, and reading the reviews I just didn't feel committed to watch it. So I waited, avoided spoilers, and watched it at home. Man, am I disappointed I didn't watch it in the theater! This is a very good film on its own, and also within the franchise. It's a fun ride, the high points are expected (obviously he's going to meet Chewie), but the action dialogue and sub plots are well done. It's become too easy for people to jump on the Disney hate train. I waited from 1983 until 2002, in real life, without a new movie. I got a set of three to watch in theaters with my son and then had to wait ten more years. Nothing will replace the original trilogy for me and those fans who grew up with it.

1740,adam-956-657693,Keep doing these spinoffs,7,18 June 2018,"Solo manages to create likeable characters and areas of suspense despite that we know some characters will survive. This is the first Star Wars movie that doesn't have the fate of the universe at stake. If the heroes don't win, the galaxy isn't doomed. Instead it focuses on the point that it is everyone for themselves, and to not trust anyone. This focuses on the characters of the story rather than the fate of the galaxy, which easily allows development and for audience to relate, sympathise and/or enjoy the characters on screen. Some twists and moments remained unexpected with the new and returning characters, as well as everyone betraying one another in different ways. 
It sits at a 7 due to some of the acting and not cutting some scenes sooner. A large portion of hans love interest scenes are corny and repetive, and the robot rebellion was overused and got old very quickly. Also for Han Solo not being the hero contradicts him starting the rebellion against the empire.
Despite this, it still manages to be a good movie that it worth watching. Doing spinoffs like this is great as we get to explore characters that we are interested in.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

'Solo' certainly has its flaws and the acting could have been better at times, but overall it's a fun ride with a pretty decent story.

Like The Last Jedi, this is more of a Star Wars spoof. Scenes such as Han losing his trouser in an amusing manner or Han standing in Wookie poo - Yes, Wookie poo - made me want to walk straight out of the theater. This is Star Wars - not a Mel Brooks movie.The audience jeered and booed on several occasions.

1743,hansdibikibrenman,"A lackluster experience, doesn't feel like I'm watching Han Solo's life.",5,6 June 2018,"When you see Han Solo for the first time in Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope, you know the man had the rough life, there's a reason why he's bitter and sleazy, but not to the point where he doesn't have a heart.I haven't seen Rogue One, but I did hear that it was dreary and dark, and it doesn't help that Star Wars VIII wasn't also sunshine and rainbows. So I get why they didn't want to make this one too gritty, WHICH, to be fair, it has its moments of grit. I did feel they did try to make this a legit Han Solo movie. BUT I have two major problems with the film ""Solo"": 1. Han Solo is too goofy and 2. Han Solo is too old to be like this. They tried to give more comedy to Han Solo's character which in my opinion, doesn't work because Han Solo is roughly in his early to mid 20s at this point, and this is assuming Han is in his late 20s to early 30s in a New Hope. Han should probably be closer to the bitter side at this point in his life than the one's that constantly arrogant and clumsy. I understand they want to explain why he became the why he did in Episode IV, but it just felt like they wanted to have their own Star-Lord in their universe than really write Han Solo. I'm fine having some comedic moments with Han, but it's a bit much. In addition, the story already has to cope with the problem that it's a prequel. We know Han, Chewie, and Lando are gonna survive through this film, the focus should be more on intrigue and character expansion to make us go ""oh! That makes sense"" there are times they do that some what, but it feels like it's information we already know or just wasn't presented in any interesting way.I'll give it this, it has its moments of grit and it is really lighthearted either. The action is mostly fun, and the plot is mostly okay. The problem is more with style, the style of Han Solo's character and how the prequel is presented. It's just an annoying, and uninteresting film that's fun to watch once, but nothing worth re-watching again.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

It's just a shame what they had to work with was poor, Glover is extremely average as Lando, he's far better in Atlanta and the hype about his performance feels unjustified. The droid shouldn't even be in the movie, it's worse than Jar Jar. Alden was good for the most part and would probably have been great with a better script. I wish I'd waited to rent it, you find yourself checking your watch to many times for my liking. It doesn't pull you in, you spend most the film waiting for it to get better, but it doesn't and the rest of the film hoping the droid dies painfully, very painfully.

1750,jeff-198-39790,Belated Solo Review,9,4 September 2018,"The pressure was on. I promised my Little Brother (from the Big Brothers Big Sisters Association) that we would do something fun. I figured Solo would be a sure fire way for me to score some major points with my 14 year old Little Brother. But after reading the audience reviews, I started second guessing the agenda. What the heck, I thought, lets roll the dice. He likes going to movies and I'm a first generation Star Wars fan, having seen the original when I was 17; so what could better to do on a Saturday afternoon? In preparation for a potential letdown, I laid the groundwork to my Little Brother...""dude"" I said (in a effort to speak hip to him) ""don't expect too much from this movie, the audience reviews are not so hot"". He was very surprised to hear such news, but he was still willing to skip Deadpool 2 and Avengers to check out Solo.As the previews were playing, I couldn't help but flashback to when we saw The Last Jedi together for a Christmas outing. I had to quietly wish to myself that Solo was going to be better than that mess of a movie...the Last (Worst) Jedi.Ok, enough suspense...did we like Solo? Heck yeah! Was it perfect? No, but neither have any of the others been (although, Empire was close). Lets break it down. Solo started off strong. The first 1/3 had plenty of action and fun. All with a nice feel to the sets, stunts, special effects. Mr. Howard, nice work out of you! The vintage look was refreshing and the live action stunts mixed with solid CGI was top-notch. You know its good when you stop thinking about what's CGI and what's not...you just enjoy the experience. During Jedi I was constantly distracted by the fake back drops and lackluster sets, missing detail and realism. The middle third of the movie was a little slow, but we never lost interest. The end of the movie picked up fairly well; but, I must say it did not really have a grand finale...thus one of the reasons I gave it 4 of 5 stars.
 
OK, so lets review the cast. As far as Alden Ehrenreich playing the young Solo, sure he's not Harrison, and no one else will be...so get over it. And, we did get over it quickly. Alden was fine. Heck, Alden runs circles around Hayden Christensen, so all you Alden bashers may want cut to him some slack. The rest of the cast, was solid. Woody was good as usual and Emilia...well I'm a Game of Thrones fan, so I can't knock the Queen of Dragons. For a minute there I thought Disney might pursue a flashback Princess Leia type storyline and have her captures chain her up in a gold bikini. Sorry to disappoint any of you GOT fans, that did not happen. Back to the cast: Chewy was classic (although looking a little undernourished). His fight scenes were awesome, showing some flat out brut wookie power...no finesse required! It was also nice to see Westworld's Thandie Newton playing another badass woman. Donald Glover was very smooth as Lando. I look forward to seeing more of him. Lastly L3-37, Lando's droid, I'll take her anytime over Jar Jar or the Porg.What would I have done differently if Ron Howard would have consulted with me first? I think Han could have been funnier. His lines were OK, but come on, Han should command at least 4 or 5 laugh-out-loud moments, instead of just a few audience chuckles. Secondly, the bad guy, was not that bad. He was like a Bill Gates with some scars carrying a glowing switchblade. Man I miss Jabba the Hutt. Finally, the ending needed more of bang instead of a light poof. Maybe it seemed that way because it started out so strong which had energized my expectations. Nevertheless, I fully expect to see Solo catch on...the first key is to accept that no one will ever fill Harrison Ford's shoes, just like no one could match Sean Connery's James Bond...but thankfully the movie makers didn't quit trying.Thanks Solo, It was a good day for my Little Brother and me!

1752,ishaanrahman02,A fun addition to Disney's Star Wars line,7,31 May 2018,"Minor Spoilers!
Even as someone who loved The Last Jedi and is completely on board with Disney's treatment of the Star Wars saga, I was skeptical of this film. To put it simply, I didn't think it needed to be made. That said, much like another 'pointless movie', Spider-Man: Homecoming, it delivers just enough to be a worthy addition to Disney's Star Wars line albeit not as well as Homecoming did. Alden Ehrenreich's Han Solo is for-the-most-part on point and manages to capture most of Harrison Ford's original portrayal. Donald Glover is also great as Lando Calrissian, however, Woody Harrelson's Tobias Becket steals the show. The action is great, although pretty much what you would expect from a film with this budget. Unlike Rogue One, which also went through numerous reshoots, Solo's scars are more visible. The first half of the movie is noticeably different in terms of characters and tone than the second half. In addition, it does have a more industrial, production line feel than its more unique predecessors, however, for the most part it doesn't detract from the experience. Overall, the film does do justice to the original trilogy characters that it has and it is a fun, lighthearted run. Whilst not as nostalgic as the Force Awakens or as groundbreaking as the Last Jedi or Rogue One, it still holds up.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
1753,chicharr-233-927539,True to the spirit of Han and Lando,9,25 May 2018,"I had a feeling of dread when I heard about the behind-the-scenes troubles in Solo's acting and directing, and a bit better, when some of the critics' reviews came out and praised the movie. The Empire Strikes Back came out when I was 10 and I immediately fell in love with Han Solo, so I was prepared to be disappointed.I was not disappointed. I was entertained and delighted throughout the movie, feeling like it really provided a worthy backstory to the relationship between Han and Lando (and of course, Chewbacca). The acting was uniformly excellent and the characters were compelling (L3 is my spirit droid). I was happy to see that the characters new to me (Qi'ra, Beckett, Rio, Val) fit in with the characters I already knew. I had some cringe-y moments watching The Last Jedi, but I didn't get that feeling here at all.If you know the way TESB was directed, it moved back and forth from Luke's adventure to that of Han and Leia - this movie *felt* like the Han and Leia portions. There was lots of action, witty dialogue, interesting encounters with different humanoid species, etc. It was extremely fun, very smooth, playful and sexy in an interesting way (that may have just been Daniel Glover). I also thought it shed an interesting light on events in Empire and Return of the Jedi.Of the new films, I would place it just under TFA and just above Rogue One, with TLJ heading out the list.

Not only did I not really feel like I needed to see a Han Solo prequel film, but similar to Rogue One, the trailers had me cringing pretty hard. I knew before going in that Alden's performance would make or break this film for me, and boy did he ever make it! He was so effortlessly charming, and just acting with tons of unearned confidence. The perfect Han Solo. I would even dare say he out did the great Harrison Ford in the role(who famously hates the character anyway). Star Wars purists please forgive me for that last sentence, but I have to give the kid the credit he deserves as an actor! I can't even imagine the kind of pressure he felt in crafting this performance. To come through that with the performance he did is absolutely worthy of high praise from this Star Wars fan. Donald Glover does a pretty good Billy Dee impression along the way, Chewbacca has some great moments, and the rest of the supporting cast gets by just fine, but the film absolutely belongs Alden Ehrenreich. It definitely wasn't a perfect film. The first act is so full of eye rolling cheese and awful pacing that it nearly derails the whole story before it even gets started. I also personally didn't care for the sassy droid this time around. HK-47(of KOTOR fame)was incredible, K-2SO from Rogue One was a nice nod to HK-47, but now we've taken it too far with L3-37. I didn't find her funny at all, and her ""romantic tension"" with Lando and political outlook just felt. . . Awkward and unnecessary. All that aside, the action set pieces were fantastic, the debate about what a ""parsec"" actually is gets settled, there's a pretty huge cameo at the end that will only make sense if you watch the animated tv shows, and I left the theater with a big smile on my face, actually hoping I haven't seen the last of Alden as young Han.

This movie is one of the best Star Wars films I've seen in a long while. I enjoyed it more than Rogue One (For real, it was a downer). In fact, the past three SW movies have been complete downers as we've seen characters killed off one-by-one, again and again. It's been pretty depressing.I think we needed this movie. It was fun. It was thrilling. It had that classic SW feel, and man, the aliens were incredibly well done as well as the sets and the effects.The cast is spot-on as well, and although I never thought anybody else could be Han, Alden Ehrenreich did a dang good job. Lando? Okay, Glover was chanelling Billy Dee pretty much. Chewie was finally more than just big hairy window dressing, and the rest of the characters did a bang up job with their respective roles.Man. I just cannot explain how happy I was walking out of the theater. And that reveal at the end? I can't wait for the sequel.Do yourself a favor if you're a SW fan and ignore the fan hate.

1760,tonygallagher-85207,As Deadpool said 'well that's just lazy writing'.,5,7 June 2018,"First, the positives: Glover, very good. Alden, not bad. L3, fun. Annnnnnnnnd, that's it. 
Deep breath for the negatives: bad casting everywhere other than those mentioned above. Rogue One took a chance on lots of things but particularly in casting relative unknowns. And that worked really well. As good as Harrelson, Newton, Clarke and Bettany are as actors they just didn't...... fit. Too famous, too linked to other franchises and mainly too British. Princess Leia was ballsy because she was American. Lucasfilm now seem to cast EVERY female part to British actors. One or two is fine but ALL of them? Even the female robot? They dont have to be American per se but a bit more diversity would be nice to give them a harder edge. 
The story? Bland, forced, clumsy and predictable. The twists? Dull and forced. You could see Lord and Millers script peeking out at times and they were refreshing. I'd loved to have seen their version over this disappointment. 
The reveal of the marauders? Were we supposed to be impressed? Who was the girl in the mast who induced surprised looks? No relevance! 
The big hooded reveal? Meh!
The soundtrack? Poor!! Not enough memorable sweeping hooks and heroic moments, a rare Williams misstep. 
The effects? I wanted to see more of the WW1 mudscape but the budget didn't seems to extend to more than close shots.
I could go on and on. I went with low expectations in the hope I would be pleasantly surprised but from the start when wheel-less cars did handbreak turns to how he got his surname just slapped me in the face with a wet fish of lazy writing and far too safe (sorry Ron) directing. 
I recall being wonderfully surprised by how good Rogue One was. This had the opportunity to be just as original and yet faithful to the Star Wars mythology but it ended up dangerously close to Phantom Menace disappointing but thankfully not quite and that's as much praise as I can give it.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

I could have done without the SJW robot, but other than that unnecessary addition to the Disney list of Star Wars bad choices, it wasn't a bad movie! It was nice to be entertained by a Star Wars movie. After that insult they called ""The Last Jedi"", we needed something to keep us interested in Disney's next attempt at getting the Star Wars continuation right. Up until now, I was certain they were going to destroy a beloved franchise with their SJW nonsense, like they nearly did with Solo! Seriously, If that robot would have gotten any more screen time, my eight star rating would have dropped to one! Even so, I think Disney shot themselves in the foot by trying to shove their feminist and ""social justice"" politics down our throats! That nonsense destroyed the Last Jedi, and it's left viewers with a bad taste in their mouths. I truly believe that Solo would have done much better at the box office if it hadn't followed Rian Johnson's abomination!

Upon seeing this movie, I left the theater extremely pleased with the result. First off, all the performances from Alden to Donald Glover were fantastic. After seeing the trailers I was very skeptical of Alden but he proved me wrong throughout the film. He nailed the mannerisms and movement of Han Solo to a tee and gave the best performance he possibly could in the role. Donald Glover was perfect as Lando as expected, and Woody Harrelson and Emilia Clarke act as solid foils for Han. The villain(s) in the movie are solid but nothing special and the plot at some points can seem dull. However, overall, Solo offers a fun ride with many nostalgic and informative moments that drive the story forward. Also with the appearance of Maul at the conclusion, it was nice to see Disney finally acknowledging the overall canon of Star Wars in the films. Solo isn't the best Star Wars movie but it is a welcome edition to the family.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

Sure it gives him a reason to fight but why not turn her into a life-long friend? It just makes more sense. They already made so many new characters one more won't hurt! The end scene at the ship was disappointing and for me personally the worst area of the movie. Overall this scene was hard to comprehend. I mean what side is Qira on? Is she betraying Han or not? I personally don't know. Then there is Maul... The reason my hand met my face. WHY DISNEY!?!?!?!?!? YOU BRING HIM BACK IN ALL THE FILMS AND TV SHOWS HE DIED IN THE PHANTOM MENACE LET HIM DIE! YOU DIDNT DO THIS WITH OBI-WAN OR YODA SO WHY WITH MAUL? JUST LET HIM DIE! Again this movie did not disappoint... Did I mention the lack of the iconic Star Wars scrolling text? This has been what defined a Star Wars movie and is now missing in one!?!?!? Seriously Disney. I think the screenwriters were thinking this is a TV show but it is in reality a movie.

The score is a complete let down and sounds like a bad cover of John Williams original masterpiece. However the movie does have some very redeemable qualities.

I would have had a great sleep too had I not just had a coffee and had there not been serial explosions at ridiculous volume throughout the film. I think the problem is that none of the characters are strong enough. And the script is dodgy as. Han does an ok job of being a young Han I guess. Lando is probably the strongest character. In fact, thinking about it, they would have done better to make the film about his adventures. It might have been more fun! The female character is weakly written and all the usual sexist undertones that the writers probably aren't even aware they're writing are there.On top of all of this, I just simply found it boring. The plot didn't grip me. Nothing compelled me to any of the characters particularly. (I'm not a massive fan of Rogue One but it does have some strong characters. I cared about them at least.) Hence my lovely little nap. Finally, it's way too long. Why are films so long these days?! I have to say though that the kids (12 and 10, girl and boy) both loved it. They didn't think it was long.

It is not an excellent Star Wars movie, or a crazy awesome Star Wars movie. And it is not a fantastic Star Wars movie. But, it is a really good Star Wars movie in the sense that it's a lot of fun. And feels like an exciting Star Wars Adventure. The movie gives its audience exactly what you would want in a Star Wars movie. It is fun, it is funny, with great action, and as per usual great visuals. Best part is, it doesn't try to take itself too seriously. It was just pure fun entertainment. However, there are some flaws with this movie. ""Solo: A Star Wars Story,"" doesn't give too much background on whom Han Solo is. Meaning that you don't really learn anything new about him. The audience is given a brief summary and then, the movie quickly turns into a heist film. The film also doesn't make good use of its characters. Some of the characters that are introduced are quickly killed off. You start to get to know them, and then poof. I also feel the movie needed more of Paul Bettany's character, Dryden Vos. It should also be noted that there are a couple of parts of the movie that may feel like something is missing. I found myself asking ""How did they get there?"" So, the editing is a little off. You can tell that there are a few bits of scenes that are cut off. Other than what I mentioned, as I already stated I thought it was pretty good. I felt that all the actors involved did their parts well. The actor that I thought was really good was Donald Glover, whom plays as Lando. I thought Glover was dead on with his character as a younger Lando. I would have wanted more of him. Alden Ehrenreich as Han Solo I thought did his role well too. It does take a while to get into Alden Ehrenreich as the young Han Solo. But, for the most part his performance was solid. The thing I liked the most about this movie was that it wasn't like the other movies that have come out under the umbrella of Disney. It wasn't about The Empire VS Rebellion. Or about the Death Star. It is made clear that this takes place during the time period of The Empire but, there is no focus on The Rebels, or any mention of any type of Rebellion that has formed. ""Solo A Star Wars Story"" is still much of the same but, it also does its own thing. It just puts the focus more on the criminal word of Star Wars, and not too much on anything else. It also does not give a typical Star Wars score. Which is one of the things I liked about it. Other than recycled themes, the musical score is more of a action themed. I thought it was nice that the score did it's own thing. At the end of it all ""Solo A Star Wars Story"" is a flawed and yet fun movie experience.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
1789,mmackey-72535,Much better than 2/3 of the reviews give it credit for.,9,13 May 2019,"First off... I'm not one that purely hates The Last Jedi. That said, Solo: A Star Wars Story, Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, and The Force Awakens were all superior films.Secondly... this movie had every ounce of merit in being made to tell a story and paint the picture of a beloved character. On various messageboards you'll see fans talk up about how they'd rather seen an Obi Wan movie and for that I have to ask... why?Do you really want to see an inconsequential, youthful Obi Wan go through romance and a brutal breakup? Do you really need to see Obi Wan trained by Qui Gon? There's not a lot of fodder there to an ""EARLY"" Obi Wan title to make anything that has any lasting potential. There's no meat on them bones. As such, a Solo story or even a Solo saga is a much deeper potential storyline.As far as Obi Wan post-Revenge of the Sith? That's got even less of a storyline. As long as Vader and the Emperor knew that a Jedi of Obi's abilities was out there, there'd be a significant bounty put out by the Galactic Empire to notify them of his whereabouts and/or bring him in, dead or alive. So to sit there and watch as a still young Jedi hides in a cave (to remain on the downlow) and becomes an elder Jedi? Might as well sit home and watch paint dry. There couldn't possibly be a more boring Star Wars movie without it being called the '78 Christmas Special.My friends... it's between this story and a story about the Fett's (take your pick, Jengo or Boba) that have intrigue and a keen interest to tell a side or backstory that's not a major saga film. The fact they were able to spell out what makes Han tick and makes him think as he does, while telling a solid backstory about where he came from and what got him into being a smuggler... makes this movie have solid merits. The fact the movie went through the issues it did with losing it's directors who were replaced by the legendary Ron Howard who not only salvaged the movie but turned it into a very entertaining story? I think it made Ronnie into a patron saint of the Star Wars movies IMHO.If not for the butthurt TLJ naysayers, this movie would be a solid 8+ on IMDB. Considering the anti-Disney angst because of Rian Johnson shooting his mouth off after the criticisms of his work? It's not a shocker that this movie is devalued FAR from what it should be. It's definitely a better movie than TLJ, so at least it warrants a 7.8 IMDB rating (what TLJ is sitting at) and not the current 7.0. That said, I'd put it up there with A New Hope, Empire, Revenge of the Sith, Rogue One, and Return of the Jedi as one of the better Star Wars movies to date.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
1790,ramborob,From My Facebook Site: Everything Star Wars,10,27 May 2018,"Solo: A Star Wars Story. Review:
As usual this review will not contain any spoilers or plot points but simply give an insight to the administrator's opinions and thoughts of the film.
Where to start.....well quite simply this film is so Awesomely Epic that I have already made a space in my Blu-Ray shelves and can't wait to see it again!!!
While Rogue One was the Definitive War Movie within the Star Wars Galaxy complete with World War II references; Solo bursts onto the screen and becomes the first Crime Film Epic in the Universe we have grown to love over the last 41 years.
I say Crime Film as Solo brings a whole new element to the Star Wars world and features all the expected elements of the genre such as Cool Mob Bosses, Exciting Chases, Double and Triple Crosses and Classic Card Game Sequences.
First the Positives:
I have read many articles that Alden Ehrenreich does a poor job and is no Harrison Ford; I think this is complete nonsense. Yes he is not Harrison Ford, he is a completely different human being!!! But what he does is capture the charm and swagger of Ford and brings youth and a new dimension to the Han character that is balanced in both humour and dramatics when required.
Chewbacca is FINALLY given time to shine with excellent fighting scenes while providing wonderful comic relief when required.
Donald Glover's Lando is perhaps one of the standouts in the movie with Glover capturing Billy Dee Williams' mannerisms and suaveness while like Ehrenreich, bringing new qualities to the character.
I loved Paul Bettany's smooth Crime Boss character who filled the screen with the sliminess of an excellent Bond Villain mixed the evilness of typical Hollywood Mob Leader whose quick to change their manner given the situation they are in.
As for the rest, Emilia Clarke burns up the screen with her incredible sexiness while Woody Harrelson is well Woody Harrelson and delivers a performance which is nothing exceptional but typical from his last 10-20 roles he has given over the last years.
Now the Negatives:
Ummmmmmm......NOTHING!!!!!
This Film is Brilliant!!!!
Summary:
Do yourself a favour and rush out to see this movie, it is that MINT!!!!
With the news this week that James Mangold will be helming Boba Fett Film as the next Star Wars spin-off, I really hope that Han, Chewie and Lando will be utilised and we start seeing a whole new series of films within Lucas' much loved Universe!!!

1791,ravenheart-39762,"Hmm, really disappointed!",4,27 May 2018,"Wait for Blu-ray. I like the original trilogy, didn't care for the prequels. I like all Disney's Star Wars, up to this point they've been okay. Solo is the first movie I've walked out on, well, since I can recall. I'm generally forgiving if entertained but alas I was bored. I Left halfway through and didn't feel bad about it. No real antagonist, story didn't pace well with the action, no feel for the main characters. I thought it was bland and felt like a mess. Maybe I'll try it again on Blu ray, collect it just for collection sakes. 4/10 stars for trying...I guess.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
1792,royford-46797,Loved it!,8,20 June 2018,"This is the first modern Star Wars flick I've truly enjoyed. You could say it's clunky in parts but you've clearly only been watching the franchise with fanboy eyes. The original trilogy is rife with much of the same.
This time out the story isn't too overcooked, it's just overcooked enough. Well-done -to complete the metaphor. It's a SPACE OPERA after all.
Thought Howard did a fantastic job of balancing new worlds, new characters, familiar characters. It's notably the first Star Wars film built around just one major character.
The action is tightly coordinated, the effects are the best of the series to date, and the acting is spot on. I really hope we get to see the rest of Han's back story.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

Han & Lando were channeled perfectly & Qira & L3 we're awesome additions. Go see & just have fun, made me feel like a kid again for a few hours & im sure my nephew & niece will love it just as much.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
1798,gabrielpinzon,Is very entertaining and yet funny film than the last jedi,7,27 May 2018,"The Last Jedi is a big disappointment for the Star Wars saga and I would never watch a new episode of this new trilogy. I didn't have a great expectation for this film due to its problem of production and change new filmmakers.
And let me tell you that this film is a big surprise for me.
Is not perfect and it doesn't have that ambition that had the original trilogy, but this film doesn't make you feel disappointed if you want to know about the beginning of this beloved character. And it has very shocking action sequences and some charismatic characters.
Alden endereich makes a great performance of Han Solo with all his potential, but sometimes his performance seems that the script forced him to do some expressions like Harrison ford did, but he fails on it.
Chewbacca never disappoints in any film of Star Wars and here is one of the best characters and the chemistry with solo is very unique. Lando charissian with Donald Glover is another beloved character on this film and OMG The android( I don't remember her name) is an badasss and very charismatic addition on the story and has some great moments. It has some striking visuals effects and the cinematography is vey solid and unique.
On the negative side of the film: the story has some poorly narrative elements which make it some convoluted dialogs and cliches elements that didn't add new.
Emilia Clarke, sorry baby but this film is not for you. She is a great character with Daeyenneris on Game of thrones, but her character and the expression she gives to the audience is not on her potential.
Paul Bettany as the villain.... it has some good moments, but his character development is poorly written and it doesn't have very much to do in the film.
In spite of ,is a solid flawed yet funny film that makes you feel that you are having a good experience with this great characters and espectacular action sequences. Much better than the last Jedi.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
1799,madzima,Never should have or needed to exist,2,26 May 2018,"Maybe there are some things in the Star Wars universe that should just be kept a mystery. One of those things is the past of Han Solo. Not that the beloved character doesn't have an intriguing past, but this movie nearly disgraces the name of the character Star Wars fans know and love.
Alden Ehrenreich is nowhere close to capturing the spirit of Han Solo like Harrison Ford. Yes the character of Han in general is a bit smug, but watching this guy deliver line after line of cheesy dialogue like an actor on his first day of drama class will want to make you punch him in the face. 
The plot is decent. Nothing really special. But if you're like me, you'll be too busy cringing at nearly every line of dialogue and rooting for the failure of several annoying side characters to even remember what's going on in this story. Also, the romance between Han and Kira (Emilia Clarke) seems forced at times which doesn't help when the two have little to no on screen chemistry. 
It's sad to say that the biggest redeeming quality of this movie is Chewbacca. Donald Glover as Lando Calrissian is probably the best performance by a human in this movie, and he's only ok. He manages to capture a good amount of the charisma of Lando from the original trilogy, but sometimes slips into this weird accent that will have you saying 'wtf?'
Long story short, don't waste your money to go see this movie. I'm a Star Wars fan, not a die hard but still a committed fan, and following up a mediocre episode in The Last Jedi with this piece of hot garbage has me wondering if I should ever spend my money on a Star Wars movie again.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
1800,aquaspleen,a great escape,10,31 May 2018,"More than any star wars movie since the original trilogy, this one let me escape and get lost in this universe. In general, everyone is too critical in their dissections of star wars movies. If you just clear your mind and soak it is without analyzing, it's much more enjoyable. The main thematic elements deal with finding a moral independent path in a world where everyone seems to have to sell themselves out to survive. this adds depth the the galaxy that the rebels were fighting for in the original trilogy and rogue one.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
1801,gungfugilman,Loved it!,9,18 June 2018,"A fun crime caper set in the Star Wars universe. It's got thrills, chases, blaster fights, light comedy, betrayals, just a fun ride at the movies. Ehrenreich scenes as Han with both Glover as Lando and Suotamo as Chewie are great, had me smiling while the action and tension exploded around them. Clarke is great, a 1930's style femme fatale that works fantastic. Some of the supporting characters were more miss than hit, (Lando's droid was 50% fun/50% annoying,) and the Rio character just seemed a rip off of Rocket in Guardians (funny Star Wars ripping off Guardians, which was Marvels successful attempt at ripping off Star Wars in the first place!) They didn't detract from my fun much. It didn't end on a cliffhanger, but planted seeds for future adventures (which sadly, probably won't happen due to this one's poor performance,) but I very much loved this fun popcorn mishmash of heist thriller, origin story, western, and space opera. I have a good feeling about this.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

1803,davisz-40707,I Really Don't Get The Fuss,10,27 May 2018,"When I read through these comments, I see very little optimism. It seems a lot of people were convinced the movie was going to suck before they watched it, and if you think it's going to suck, you are more likely to see it and think it sucks. I loved the movie. The Kessel run has always been an intriguing story, and I believe this was the story that had to be told. We learn how Chewie and Han met (and it was a very realistic pairing), we learn how Han and Lando first became frenamies, and we learn how Han became the caring scumbag we all knew him to be... not to mention we get an amazing look into what stormtrooper life was really like for the majority of the troopers. Someone said Solo was a garenteed failure that could never succeed regardless of the story... that's just BS. I say anyone who can't be a little outward thinking about this film should get off their pedestal and get over their preconceived BS on what Star Wars should be. Star Wars is not going to be what you imagined in your head many years ago, because there are thousands of people who worked on this film who love Star Wars, and put a crap ton of care into it. Just because it isn't your version of Star Wars, doesn't mean it isn't worth it... it just means we live in a world with billions of minds who don't think the same as the one another. We should all learn to appreciate the art of others, and find the things we do enjoy, and attempt to acquire an appreciation for the things we might not be 100% sold on.I loved the film, and I still have some major qualms with it... but I love it because I love seeing what other people have imagined in the Star Wars Universe. News flash: Star Wars is not just about you! It's about all of us. So cut the creators some slack, because many of them really care about Star Wars!",Solo - A Star Wars Story
1804,georgedurfeeiii,Thank you Mr. Howard,7,28 May 2018,"Ron Howard definitely was a brilliant choice to bring on in the middle of filming. If there was anyone that could've saved this film, it was Ron Howard. I enjoyed how even though there is a journey Solo takes in the film, the entirety of the movie focuses more on the characters themselves rather than the events. Even minor characters were paid attention to both visually and emotionally. As an audience we become familiar with who Han Solo is, and why certain decisions were made. The actors especially gave great performances all around. Alden Ahrenreich especially shines as the titular character. The fact that Howard decided to hone in on the minds and emotions of the characters, gave us as an audience opportunity to connect more deeply with them. Had there been a decision to make it more about the visual spectacle or events of the plot, I feel like the essence of the film would've been lost or diminished. The plot is your run of the mill illegal-job story, it just takes place a long time ago in a galaxy far far away. However placing the characters in front of that archetype gave room for us as the audience to be more concerned with them instead. I thoroughly enjoyed this film and recommend all movie patrons to go see it.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

Solo does not follow the concept of the star wars and it's a whole different space fantasy movie only with the name of star wars. Sometimes it's better to leave things as they are and trying to get more profit might only ruin the meaning of movie. Hope disney or any other production company is NOT going to touch godfather trilogy...",Solo - A Star Wars Story
1808,bbode-56301,Super movie,7,23 June 2018,I liked this movie more than most people and I thought the movie was clearly depicting the Glory which made Solo who he is and stayed true towards the Saga for the fact Solo is a scoundrel which I have grown to like on the concept of him always having his wits about him in order to defend himself against all who trespass against him on the concept of justice I think solo really proves himself in order to say that he has come to he is a real trail blazer.,Solo - A Star Wars Story
1809,jackhenderson-50908,A genuinely entertaining and fun film that stays true to the Star Wars franchise,7,24 May 2018,I feel sorry for this movie in a way as it comes off of the last Jedi which many did not like and I did not find particurly good either. However this Han Solo film does a great job at what is most important and that is making it entertaining. This film never gets boring nor is it easily predictable like the force awakens was. It also has lots of references and a great cameo for the bigger Star Wars fans to pick up on a get hyped for. This film is action heavy and although I thought it could of done with some more emotional scenes in it I still did not get bored with the action as each fight scene was unique which we kept it interesting.The major flaws in this film that dectract from it is the safe nature of the film as it does not fly any Bombshells at you like the last Jedi. Also a few of the comedy scenes I found to be cringe and a horrible jar jar binks level character in the form of the token droid that seems to be a must in every Star Wars film.Overall I was plesently surprised at the quality of this movie as I did not have high hopes. This film is good for fans of the OT and new fans coming in form the sequels and is definite worth the watch.,Solo - A Star Wars Story
1810,scott_wills,Best Disney film so far,10,3 June 2018,"Solo was the first movie Disney has produced since their acquisition of SW that was actually really good. The Force Awakens and The Last Jedi were good movies but absolutely horrendous for any person who actually knows the SW universe and how the force works. Luckily, since this movie doesn't focus on force users there werent plot holes and if you pay attention there are plenty of references from every trilogy. It was very entertaining, Woody was fantastic, and theres an incredible cameo whose inclusion actually makes sense. All in all, ive read over 25 SW books and I think the plot is fairly well put together even though thats where a lot of the criticism is coming from.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

1812,BKUrs1969,Better than expected,9,23 May 2018,"I went to the movie theater without any spoilers and an open mind. I was not disappointed! 
Solo is more like a Western movie but it works. Alden Ehrenreich is a believable Han and the dynamic between him and Chewie is already great. Donald Glover as Lando absolutely nails it. He IS Lando - almost better than Billy Dee Williams.
The movie's plot is simple but entertaining and there are some nice twists.
And there's plenty nostalgic moments for the fans and lots of Easter eggs and cameos.
All in all a good movie, not quite Star Wars as you expect it as a hardcore fan, but a good action movie. And the Kasdans put some humor in it - and some Han Solo moments that make you forget that it's not Harrison Ford. Ehrenreich did a nice job.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
1813,mwberggren,Don't watch this!,1,19 October 2018,"I intended to skip Solo since Disney has been butchering the franchise, but Redbox sent me a free rental for my birthday. I foolishly squandered it on this piece of mindless trash. I'm embarrassed to live in a country that produces low-iq schlock like this, and I'm officialy finished with Disney's petty faux Star Wars universe. I can't take it anymore. Don't rent this! Terrible writing, casting, acting, and special effects. Ron Howard, it's a shame they pulled you out of retirement to try to rescue this hopeless shell of a movie. You failed.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
1814,grpe-48624,That's a crime comitted on Star Wars!,1,22 December 2019,"It's a MUST to write this critics about the Solo movie. That was the worst ever done to Star Wars. I don't understand Ron Howard who I appreciate as a good director. I don't understand the casting for Han Solo and the sense of the action of the whole movie. The actor Alden Ehrenreich who would have been forgotten immediately couldn't bring on screen the charming, clever and smart character of Han Solo like Harrison Ford did once. The important part of Solo's education in the Empire isn't really worked-out. It sounds like a big joke without laughter. The action of the movie is like a boring rollercoaster ride and in the end there should be a highlight link with Darth Maul!?!

Didn't feel like a Star Wars film at all for me, Alden didn't look or act like Harrison Ford so right from the off it didn't really work...
I thought the plot was weak, dialogue was awful and a lot of the acting cringe worthy...
The SJW Droid was completely irritating and the Lando character totally out of sync with the Billy Dee Williams version...
The cinematography was really crappy, to dark and a lot of annoying close up camera work...
Music... terrible and the bit that was good was in a scene that was a direct steal from ESB...
This was a film that didn't need making and the end result is yet another Disney fail for me, out of the 4 movies they have released only Rogue One has it for me... I have an unlimited card for my local cinema, so didn't have to pay extra to see this; however, even despite this I will be boycotting future Disney/Lucasfilm Star Wars ventures...

1819,seguizar,"An unnecessary addition, yet a decent and enjoyable film.",8,26 August 2018,"The film focuses on what is most fascinating about the character Han Solo- his moral compass. I'm The decades old question ""Did Han shoot first"" is deeply explored, and somewhat answered. The entire movie seems to encompass that gray moral area that is largely ignored in most famous Star Wars characters, such as Leia, Luke, Rey, Obi-Wan, etc.
It's refreshing to see a Star Wars movie stray away from black and white, good and evil. It's largely about a group of people that were given a bad hand in life and are just trying to make the most of it. 
The film as a whole, however, can occassionally make you think ""what's the point"" when you think of the big picture that is the Star Wars franchise. Did we need a stand alone Solo movie? Of course not. Does it make us appreciate Harrison's ""Han Solo"" character any more? Nope. Does it bug me personally? Sure. But I wouldn't go so far as to say the movie *should not* have been made.

I think they knocked it out of the park. Solo great. Chewy great. Lando so great. The droids are fun. The supporting cast is amazing. The surprises and entertainment makes me want more!

1823,imdb-51812,A spoiler free opinion on SOLO within the franchise,8,5 November 2018,"I feel sorry for SOLO.I'm not a nerdy die-hard Star Wars Fan but I really loved the original trilogy as a kid. I still liked the franchise after the (not so great) prequel trilogy and was really excited by Episode 7 (although it also had some flaws) and especially by Rogue One. And I thought Disney might be on the right track to ""make things right"".I watched every Star Wars movie in theatres since the remastered versions of the originals... The only one I did not watch was: SOLO.But that was not SOLO's fault.Episode 8 ""The Last Jedi"" just had killed all excitement I had for the franchise. And again: This is not because I'm a die-hard Star Wars fan, who is angry that they did not stick to the story of some novels or popular fan-fiction. It is because Episode 8 was so lazily written, had such stupid dialogue, stupid jokes and stupid plot (holes - actually it had more plot holes than plot) and showed that Disney had absolutely no plan or vision for a consistent story line or universe and that they obviously just did not care for such things. So everything that happens in this universe just became random and irrelevant to me.But this should be about SOLO.
(I'm just telling all this to give a spoiler-free opinion on SOLO based on my overall opinion on the Star Wars franchise)I did not care to watch solo in theatres, but of course I was willing to give it a try for small money in my living room.The negative part:
Again Disney put in some dialogue and comedy that is unneccessarily stupid and out of place. To be fair: Star Wars never was about great poetry, it always tried to be funny somehow and it always had those moments when it failed trying. But (even though not as much as in ""The Last Jedi"") two or three situations in SOLO just made me shake my head, sink into my chair in shame and think ""Oh my god, why did they do this?"".A side note: A few effects and CGI also look rather cheap.But:
For most of it's run time SOLO looks good and delivers a a solid space adventure. It has an interesting plot (without giant holes), solid acting, some good action and a lot of fun moments.I liked it. It is nothing special, nothing great, nothing epic. But it also is not a complete failure. It is just 2 hours of (good) space action, adventure and entertainment. I found it to be worth my time. And honestly I would have even found it to be worth the money to watch it in theatres.If I could I would rate it 7.5.But as I can't, and I somehow feel sorry for the low box office performance (which most likely ""The Last Jedi"" is to blame for - not SOLO) I rate it 8.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

This movie was awesome it held my interest from start to finish. I loved how it got right to the action at the very start of the movie. There were also so many twists, I'm not going to spoil anything but one particular moment in this film left me the most stunned I have ever been in a movie theater. The one small plot hole I found was that they don't really explain how Chewbacca got to where he was at the beginning of Solo from the end of Episode 3 when Yoda wishes him farewell. The only part I didn't like about the movie was st the end and that was only because I didn't want this movie to end!!!!! Such a blast best time I've had at the movies in 2018. I thought Donald Glover surpasses Billy Dee Williams as the best actor for Lando he was hilarious!!! And of course Alden doesn't quite live up to Harrison Ford mainly because Harrison has just such a unique sense of humor but I honestly do not think anyone other than Harrison could have done better in this role than Alden did in this film. Paul Bettany did a good job as the villian, and Woody Harrelson and Emilia Clarke were fantastic as always. I'm so excited for episode 9 and the other spinoff movies they have planned!

1826,Rafa_Mennella,A lively addition to the saga,8,13 June 2018,"Carried by the rowdy backlash of Episode 8: The Last Jedi, Solo doesn't perform as expected at the box office. The audience, disenchanted by the Walt Disney works during these four years of new life, preferred to turn a blind eye to this new spin off.
Probably they understimated the way of the Force. 
In fact Ron Howard portrays a faithful representation of the original trilogy atmosphere adding some smooth and exciting part in line with the modern objectives of the LucasFilm.
Alden Ehrenreich perforfmed surprisingly good in my opinion. His interaction with Chewie reminded me the old bond between Harrison Ford and Peter Mayhew. However he didn't only breeze through this stumbling block, but he realised his own Solo. And that was a reason for me to see this movie.
The other characters fit perfectly in the action. Emilia Clarke performance was a little flat although I don't like her roles except Daenerys Targaryen in Game of Thrones.
Unfortunately there is one fly in the ointment. John Powell score represented in my point of view only a flanking during the film and not a protagonist as for the John Williams' ones.

It has everything from comedy to romance, and the cast alone makes the movie one to remember. I had very low expectations for this film, and I was blown away. I'll say it again, the cast was amazing. The characters were well written, the plot flowed well, and we all know what Star Wars music can give to a movie. If you haven't seen this yet, go see it now. But do not go into the theater expecting a normal Star Wars movie. This is not like the others, and it wasn't aspiring to be.

Not mediocre, simply BAD acting. She ruins the movie. She probably tries to be mysterious, but manage to be uninteligible. Her role was not that big (in terms of lines) but she did it badly. Maybe she should stick to TV Series where she can take off her clothes and be more popular. 
And Alden Ehrenreich, he is not bad. But he simply does not have the charm of Harrison Ford. He is NOT Han Solo, not by far. The only outstanding performance was Woody Harrelson's. And the new Lando - Donald Glover is good, funny.
I really hope that when they remake Indiana Jones they would find a more suitable actor. Anyway, it may be impossible to replace actors like Harrison Ford, or Sean Connery. So far the guys from STAR TREK had done a good job - because the stars in the original series were TV series actors, and now we have movie actors...

The movie answered questions of Solo's past and hit events we knew of, but did it in satisfying ways that frequently exceeded my expectations Best of all, I had fun and my faith in Disney's handling of Star Wars was partially restored.

It's an engaging, interesting, emotional, well written story, and despite what many have said, this film has plenty of reason to exist. I hope that people go out and see it because there is so much potential for these characters and I want to see more. I hope that this film marks a new beginning in the Star Wars universe, because we only have to suffer through one more film from the current trilogy.

However, when I saw this movie, I suspended what I knew, versus what Disney is doing after they bought the Star Wars rights from George Lucas, and Lucas films. With an open mind, I went to see this movie. I was not disappointed in that they chose a different line than what was written previously. There was plenty of plot, action, drama, and even romance. I loved the fact that they did this movie in the way they did it. It was a good way to bring the back story of four of our favorite characters into the Star Wars universe. I was a tiny bit disappointed in that Lando didn't have a ship yard, but he did have the Falcon, and it was improved already, to a point. And the way Han saved Chewie, that brought about the Wookie life debt. Of course, Disney did take some liberties with things, but, overall, I loved the movie.
 I do have one other hang up about the movie, it was the sabbacc game. Of course this could be due to Disney, etc., but it didn't feel like true Sabbacc. More a card game that loosely resembled Sabbacc.

World creation is amazing. You really get a sense and feel of each planet that is created.

What the Kasdans did with the sort of scattered background information on Han I'm sure George Lucas came up on a whim all those years ago is nothing short of amazing. Considering it's troubled production I really can't stress enough how good the film has turned out, a fact I'm sure is owed to Ron Howard, who was truly born to direct this movie ( pinched that line somewhere, bit it's true!) .Being a lifelong Star Wars Fan I can only recommend you go and see Solo for yourself.

Few are claiming it's the best Star Wars movie ever. Frankly, I am only giving it 10 stars because of the number of one star reviews others are giving it. Seriously, only 1 star?

Having watched pretty much every Star Wars movie for the first time in a cinema (apart from episode 2 after the awful phantom menace...) I class myself as a Star Wars fan. Not only that, my all time favourite character is Han Solo, so you can understand my response to some of the reviews I have seen on here regarding ""Solo, a Star Wars story"". The movie I saw was action packed, had a great plot line that answers a lot of those questions about how Han got the Falcon, and just what the Kessel run was- the character immersion was top class and everyone nailed their performances. The film showed another side to the Star Wars universe away from the polished imperial galaxy we are used to, highlighting the criminal underworld that Han lived in. This is its greatest advantage as it opens new highways for the franchise to develop into. It's gritty, funny, serious and all in all a great addition to the Star Wars film base, This has quite easily made its way into my top 5 film spots from the series and Well worth a watch!",Solo - A Star Wars Story

Ron Howard brought the best out of the actors. The Kasdans usually deliver excellent writing.Many nods and winks that Star Wars fans will pick up on. 'Don't trust anyone' Beckett says, but Solo trusts Chewie - a friend friendship is born. Watch for cameos as well. Several plot twists will keep you guessing. Just what the doctor ordered. I rank this higher than the prequels - on par with the Force Awakens and Rogie One. This film is certainly less heavy than Rogue One - and it fits with Han's happy-go-lucky and l'ooking out for number one' attitude that surfaces in a New Hope.There are some issues with the story arc and when this story occurred in the Star Wars timeline. There are theories out there that can explain better than I can.Don't get duped by the negative review bombers whining about SJWs, women and minorities.

The problem this movie has is that it was cut down so much before its release that people couldn't form their own opinion. My advice is go see it! Solo has the old Star Wars feel and characters with a great story and new characters, actors and adventure. I was very impressed with the visuals, story, and all the different directions Star Wars can go from this point on. The actors were great in their roles. Woody and Donald were masterful. For all the criticism that came out prior to the release for Aiden I feel he was perfect in the role and delivered with his version of Solos charm. The movie should have been called Solo and Chewbacca because it really highlights them meeting one another and Chewbacca was a great character as always! As a diehard biased Star Wars fan I was so impressed by this movie and wanted more when it was over. It did a great job connecting the animated Star Wars universe as well as the original trilogy and had one of the better cameos in recent film history.

I for one thought Han Solo was rather well done, that is to say.. if you compare it to the recent star wars films (the force awakens and the last Jedi.)
The movie has its story line, it sticks too it.. and it doesn't derail like in most recent star wars universe cases, the introduction to new characters were not over done or made too ridiculous for cash grabs such as ( Porg ) and Alden Ehrenreich plays Han as good as anyone could expect when it comes to filling the shoes of one of the greatest actors and star wars characters of all time.. I mean really? do you people expect ANYBODY to be able to fill such shoes perfectly?

1851,radrockstar,Solid Film that adds to Han Solo,9,13 June 2018,"I personally was very skeptical of this movie after ""The Last Jedi"" but after seeing this movie I was rather happy with it. This movie did not ruin any of the characters that we know and love from the originals and in fact I think they do a good job with all of them. You (briefly) see how Han grew up and what he was up to before A New Hope and you see that while he was selfish even back then he still had some good in him as he wanted to help the people who were not with the Empire over the Empire itself, I think it was more out of the innocent being exploited and not because he believed in the cause. Chewie was true to himself and it was nice to see how Han and Chewie met and how Han can talk to Chewie. Lando was also very true to himself and I personally think that he was true to how he was in the original trilogy has he was also a bit out there and was eccentric in the Empire Strikes Back. L3-37 was a bit much but she was not horrible and it tied into the Falcon as a whole so I was able to overlook it.All in all this is a solid and I would recommend that you go and see it if you are a fan of Star Wars and also if you keep an open mind.

I just finally got a chance to see it, and it is absolutely a great SciFi action adventure movie!What do we want to see in a Scifi action adventure?
Yeah, the special effects, the actions, and the adventures (basically the adventure storyline). On all these counts, the quality is superb.The special effects are top notch. Although this is to be expected now with big budget movies, but they are nonetheless very enjoyable and look very realisticThe actions are crazy good, better than most other Star Wars. The star battles are about the same, but the train sequence is arguably the best action sequence in all of Star Wars, and it ranks up there with the best of general action adventure action sequences).The adventures are wonderful as well, a bit darker than some others, but fitting for the trying time period that it was (the empire, repression, rebellions), and merging well into the other Star Wars storyline. As a bonus, we want to have good mix of nice acting (checked!), good dialogs (checked!), likable characters (checked!), and some humor (checked!).

Do they want little boys buying Star Wars Barbie dolls? Most of the leading roles are women. There is too much estrogen and not enough testosterone. Too many hollywood films have heroines instead of heros. This works for the first movie because movie goers didn't know what to expect but sequels will always never perform as well. Wonder Woman 2 will not do as well as the first one.I gave 10 stars for ""Solo"" because it finally had a male as the leading role. You have to be an intelligent Star Wars fan to understand the film because the film is based on past Star Wars episodes.

1857,sbcoltsfan,"OK movie, but not an OK STAR WARS movie",6,9 June 2018,"When I think of Star Wars, I think of the Force, lightsabers, Skywalkers, and epic space adventures. This movie had none of these. That's not to say the movie failed at everything. I felt that Donald Glover nailed the role of Lando, especially in his first few scenes, though he did seem to me to stray from Billy Dee Williams's portrayal in later scenes. I also loved seeing the Falcon in action. Also, unlike some SW fans, I like the prequels, and I liked seeing them referenced and not ignored.SPOLIERS BELOW:Admittedly, I knew going into this film that it was a story about Han Solo, so it was unlikely that a Skywalker would make an appearance. So I was willing to set that expectation aside (along with my hope that we would see an unbandaged Dengar). The movie checked off enough boxes of Han's backstory that I felt it completed its job of telling Han's story. Han rescues Chewbacca: check. Han wins the Millennium Falcon from Lando at Sabbac: check. Han completes the Kessel Run: check. I was also fine with the minor changes to Han's story, like for example him being a former Imperial infantry soldier instead of an Officer (though why was the Empire using non-stormtrooper infantry?), because it checked off enough of the major story boxes.But after digesting the movie and compiling my thoughts, I felt that was all the movie did. Sure, space was featured, but nothing about the story was epic. There was no galaxy-affecting plot. No one used the Force, or even Force-like powers, like in Rogue One. No one even used a lightsaber (I don't count the throw-away scene at the end). It just didn't feel like a Star Wars movie.Ultimately, that's what I want from Star Wars movies. If I just wanted to see a space-adventure, there are dozens of movies and TV shows that can scratch that itch, many of which do it better than this movie did. But those other shows don't have Jedi powers and lightsabers,It leaves me worried for the state of upcoming stand alone Star Wars movies. I would much rather see a movie focused on Padawan Yoda fighting against a young Sith Order (and also see why the Sith have the rule of two), than a movie about a minor character (Boba Fett) that may have the same problem of no Force/no lightsabers.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

Who doesn't want to know more about the inimitable Han Solo?The Bad: The creators of this film had a great time showing off their ability to put together some impressive special effects, but they got so caught up in creating battle sequences and train heists that any plot feels like an after thought.As much as I think Alden Ehrenreich is a talented young actor, he really doesn't have the swagger or devil-may-care attitude that endeared millions of people to Han Solo. Ehrenreich had some impossibly big shoes to fill, and I like to think if the writers had given him a script with more substance, he could have put together a better performance.The bottom line: this movie had the potential to be epic, but instead, the filmmakers chose to play it safe and stick to the incredibly tired formula of summer blockbusters.

I was not impressed with the look of the actor playing him from trailers so I wasn't sure if I was even going to go to see it, but eventually did and boy was I surprised! It started off slow and not something I was really into. That all changed when Solo and Chewie finally met though. From there it got better and better to the point I was fully invested in it like I would be with any other Star Wars film.There were so many references to the original trilogy and the old expanded universe. I think it's great there are ways to make some of those old stories canon once again! Plus the surprise twist at the end was fantastic in a movie you thought couldn't surprise you at all.The acting ranged from good to phenomenal, the visuals were on par with the rest of the franchise so they were stunning. The plot was surprisingly good. I've seen the SW movies more times than I'm proud to admit so there were certain scenes that I couldn't reconcile with past movies, only to have them be readdressed later in a fashion that can only be described as finesse. They did their homework on this one. There were even things I noticed that tied in to the newer trilogy and explained some questions I had. Since Disney took over Rogue One has been my favorite Star Wars movie. (I'm a bit ashamed to say it's my favorite Star Wars movie overall as well.) Solo is definitely second in line for me in the Disney Era. It isn't of the same caliber as the Lucas era movies, but it works surprisingly well and I wish the Disney trilogy had taken the same approach this film did. At its core it is a Star Wars movie, it knows this, embraces it, and doesn't try to put a spin on it other than making it appeal to a modern day audience while still taking chances to have fun with it. To me, they did Han and Chewie justice.I was going to give this an 8/10 but the negative feedback from others makes me feel like it's underappreciated or misunderstood.

Emilia Clark is a bland bland actress, she did very little other than smile throughout the entire film, but then this is the problem when you pick flavour of the month actors.
I felt like the supporting cast were gimmicky and had nothing to offer than one liners. 
The music was shocking! It was just some background noise and added none of the emotion or dramatic effect like it did in the original trilogy.As for the plot it was a train heist and not even a good one.I really was hoping for a good film based on Han but this was so underwhelming I honestly wouldn't bother putting it on on DVD.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
1869,jordanbaribeau,The Importance of Expectations,7,14 September 2018,"As a background prior to watching the movie, I didn't expect much. In fact, I went into this movie with the backdrop of how poorly it performed at the box office and the reviews from sites like IMDB. Generally speaking, I thought that this movie would be a let down. This movie is better than The Force Awakens, The Last Jedi and the first two films of the prequel series. However, that's not saying all that much. The general themes are recognizable with Han Solo being somewhere between the good and bad guy and coming out as the cool cowboy-esque hero. In some respects this was entirely predictable but the constant twists and games Solo moves through is overdone. The constant betrayals becomes tiring and predictable. Lando and the other ""classical"" Star Wars elements are there but it feels like the movie attempts to put too much into the movie. There are too many direct references without a deeper story (Kessel run, dice, etc.). Another problem is that the villain comes across and weak and not all too important. The link to Darth Maul however, was a pleasant surprise. The action and the adventure parts of the movie are well done and doesn't try to do too much. It fits a Han Solo-type of story and borders the Star Wars world while trying to push the envelop. Chewie running around and being the monster we rarely see was kind of cool and he actually comes across as a character with purpose. There were some notably rough scenes and moments in the movie: I thought Lando's droid was too noisy and too far removed from the droids we know and love from Star Wars. It felt out of place. Lando and his gambling created a very simplistic character. I wanted more out of Lando. The death of Dryden Vos was very predictable as was the train scene. It's not a horrible movie by any stretch of the imagination. And more importantly, it's not that far removed from the elements of Star Wars that makes Star Wars what we remember. In other words, it's far better than The Last Jedi. However, it's not perfect. It had too many direct references to the original movies and didn't build any of the characters as much as I would have liked.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
1870,morekayleecool,Solo: An Amazing Story,10,5 September 2018,"*This is my own personal view and opinion about this movie*I have always been a fan of Han Solo, and so when I heard this movie was coming out I was instantly excited about seeing it. Probably a couple weeks before it was coming out, a lot of people had been talking about how they were worried about the acting, whether it was going to come out well, etc. I then started to get worried about whether it would be good or not, so I went into seeing the movie with expectations of it possibly not being really good. It over exceeded my expectations, it was honestly amazing. I personally think it's one of the best Star Wars movies they've made, even better then Rogue One. The acting was probably a 7/10, I don't think that they did horrible like people say they did. Alden did a pretty good job at playing Han, He did well with Han's humor and character. People need to understand that he had big shoes to fill and he is not a replica of Harrison Ford. I also think that Donald did a pretty good job at playing Lando. I feel like everything was at a good pace, it wasn't moving too fast or too slow. I liked the characters in this movie that we hadn't seen before or heard of, such as Beckett, Val, and L-3. It had good humor in it, which I was worried about considering Han's character is very sarcastic/humorous. I liked Qi'ra's character, she was very mysterious and I'm still very interested to see what's going to happen with her betraying Han at the end of the movie if they make a second one. I think another reason why I liked this particular Star Wars movie is because of the fact that it had a very different vibe to it then any of the other Star Wars movies. It was just very different compared to the other Star Wars movies considering the time period the movie is in, and I just really liked that about it. I've seen all the Star Wars movies, the prequels, originals, sequels, Rogue One, and nothing was like this which I enjoyed. All of the CGI effects were amazing, and it was a very well edited movie, I edit myself so I know when a movie is well edited or not. My Dad went to go see this movie with me, and he too is a very big fan of Han Solo and he rated it a 9/10, which my Dad is very picky about movies and I was surprised that he liked it so much. I also think that for people who don't like Han and his character, they probably will not like this movie a whole lot or will give it a lower rating. One of my friends went and saw it and she has never really liked Han that much, and came out of the theater not satisfied. So just remember, if you're going to see this movie and rate it, you need to somewhat like Han and his character because if you don't you may not like it as much. Overall, I was very happy with the outcome of Solo. I don't think it deserves as much hate as people have been giving it, I myself was worried about the outcome of it as well and it ended up being one of the best Star Wars movies (In my opinion) that I have seen.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
1871,obersturmbahnfuehrer,Refined vs. diluted,2,10 September 2018,"First off, I don't consider this a spoiler, since the movie doesn't have much of a storyline to begin with. So, they drop a whole rail cart of that refined thing and to make up for it, go for the unrefined stuff - 11 man carried canisters. This is not how refinement works. Getting tens of tons out of several canisters requires dilution and ironically this is what the screen writers have been doing to the stuff they have been snorting or shooting up their veins. Since they don't know any better, they have watered down the whole Disney Star Wars mess. The embarrassment is steadily turning into a farce.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
1872,jakedempsey-13544,Solo is Unexpectedly Awesome,9,14 September 2018,"I went into this movie with the lowest possible expectations. I've been a hardcore Star Wars fan all my life, and I anticipated a low-quality cash grab. I was ready to be thoroughly disappointed with unnecessary backstory to a character who frankly didn't need any. With that said, I literally did not stop smiling the entire film. 
Solo proved to be action-packed, and did an excellent job portraying the character. The movie had plenty of moments that felt absolutely appropriate happening to Han Solo. Han is constantly using the same charm and wit that he portrays in the OT. The introduction of a love interest and the meeting of Chewbacca did nothing that devalues Harrison Ford's character in the original trilogy. The supporting cast is excellent, the battles are intense without feeling drawn-out, the villain is a perfect representation of a gangster in space, and there are very few plot holes. 
The movie is also full of references for hardcore fans like myself, and the surprise cameo at the end is both shocking and exciting. Without giving any spoilers, fans of The Clone Wars television series will be absolutely thrilled. The movie provided plenty of laughs and great entertainment, and I cannot recommend this movie enough. I would consider it one of my personal favorite Star Wars movies. I think it's important for people who hate on Disney's new films to keep in mind that this is ultimately a children's franchise and it shouldn't be taken too seriously. People who hated The Last Jedi were unnecessarily harsh on this film, and I've found that many friends who were critical of the last movie absolutely loved Solo as well. 
In short, I highly recommend Solo as it is great fun and possesses a thoughtful story that fits well with George Lucas's original trilogy.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

Because they have a well established story.Looks like Disney have forgotten what the idea of ""Story"" in the title means...I have tried three or four times to watch the BluRay copy and couldn't get passed the 00:25 to 00:30 minute mark. I simplu could not connect at all with everything on screen: the characters, the atmosphere, the SW universe. Seemed like I couldn't care less about anything in that movie. Then, I was ill for couple of days and managed to watch the movie end-to-end.My favorite moment? When that ultra-annoying, sorry-a$$ excuse of a robot, with all those SJW flat jokes, was finally put out of order. Every line coming out of that L3-37 droid was the opposite of fun, bland and flat to death. George Luca's C3-PO and even our chubby little friend, R2-D2, were light years better in comics and fun lines.Conclusion: this is not a Star Wars movie. There were some good parts for CGI or some characters (Lando e.g.) but the script ruined them all. Solo could have been a more intricate and witty character only by studying the scripts of episodes IV to VI.

Yes, Disney has managed to set the bar so low and push expectations so down that people are clutching at straws. Along comes a meaningless and largely boring film about some weak and lame mafia in space and everyone is excited because it is not Episodes 7, 8 or 9.I have news people: instead of being dazzled by cool whoosy wooooy explosive trailers by Disney go for a jog or get some cool ingredients and cook yourselves an exciting new meal.Way better than this boring film. When Han meets Chewie we feel nothing (other than a bathroom break coming?).It is boring and tinted blue the whole time for some reason.

1900,yiannimitropoulos,The most underrated Star Wars movie,9,20 December 2019,"The stand-alone Han Solo movie is easily the most underrated Star Wars movie in existence. It outshines the prequels, kills all that JJ and Rian Johnson stuff, and genuinely captures some of the magic of the original trilogy in ways I didn't think Disney was capable of.The magic of this story is all in the set up. As an audience, we know that young, idealistic Han Solo has to suffer a profound betrayal somewhere down in the line so that he can end up as the self-centered, cynical opportunist that Luke meets in Tatooine. The only question is how this happens. Handling this delicate issue with nuance and grace is where ""Solo"" really shines.Unlike most romance-adventure film, this one starts off with the male protagonist already having the girl's affections. Han and Qi'ra start off in the kind of relationship you can easily feel good about: they stick up for each other, derive a degree of hope from each other's existence, and work together to escape the bonds of servitude that associated with the gangster life they've both been cast into. But in a cruel twist of fate, their daring plan to escape partially backfires. Han gets out; Qi'ra doesn't. Racked by guilt, he spends the next few years trying to get a starship of his own to mount a rescue mission.When they meet again, a lot has changed. Qi'ra, as it turns out, is alive and well, though it would seem that she has effectively ""sold her soul"" in order to survive. She's climbed the ranks of a major crime syndicate, bears a brand indicating some kind of slavery or bonded-indenture situation, and she's dating one of the most dangerous man imaginable (played by Paul Bettany). Since Han obviously still loves her, she's thus perfectly placed to transform optimistic young Han into his jaded and egocentric future-self. Most of ""Solo"" is characterized by the powerful tension that this pattern of expectations creates.To keep the length of this review manageable, I'll focus only on the Qi'ra/Han interplay. There were lots of other characters and relationships that were handled quite well in this film (Lando, Chewie, Beckett), but they're also less fundamental to the broader story.The point is this: Qi'ra will obviously betray our protagonist; the narrative and context demand it. She's nonetheless portrayed sympathetically, and the audience finds themselves daring to hope they're wrong. Whereas ""Force Awakens"" and ""Last Jedi"" left many audience members feeling only halfway connected to the protagonists (or even actively alienated), ""Solo"" effortlessly involves its audience in the character's story arc and leans away from any overtly political messages.The most interesting thing about this movie is that over expectations are subverted in the most satisfying of ways. Qi'ra never really betrays Han, though others do, and in retrospect one can see her actively taking risks to protect him from the simple truth of her involvement with all kinds of extremely dangerous people. By the end of this movie, we still don't know how the idealistic Han portrayed in ""Solo"" became cynical and world-wisened, but we do have a whole lot of reason to come back for a sequel and see their dangerously sincere romance fleshed out further.And that's really the secret of Star Wars: the power of these films is in the stories they tell, not the universe they're in. Hacks like JJ Abrams and Rian Johnson think Star Wars is a formula, a particular kind of story that, if told with enough craft, will bring in the big dollars and sell a lot of merchandise. JJ embraced this notion; Rian actively riled against it; but both filmmakers have simply failed to understand what keeps fans coming back to this series. Adults don't come to these movies to learn about the differing power levels of different Jedi, or to see increasingly big war machines, or the next over-the-top feat that it turns out you can do with Force. We come to these movies to get involved in the emotional lives of sympathetic characters, to root for them in a tough spot, and hope they find a way to satisfy their own needs without hurting the people around them. Star Wars is not a magic powder, it's just icing on the cake, and the cake already has to work on its own, or the icing won't have much effect.The thing I love about this movie is that it could have worked with a totally different icing. They could have made it as a Western, or a Pirate movie, or a Fantasy flick in which magicians and elves with pointy walk the Earth. Whatever icing you added to the cake would have worked pretty well, so long as the broader context - in which a pre-existing romance between two sympathic characters was clearly going to be someone's demise - was put in place early in the movie, and handled with the delicate attention to detail it deserved.If you liked the original trilogy vibe, you should definitely see this movie. Sure, it tells a totally different story to that of the Luke/Han/Leia trajectory, but it's a story that was worth telling nonetheless, irrespective of the universe in which it was set.For myself, I think this could be a springboard to a really great sequence of movies. Everyone expects Qi'ra to be the bad guy, but they're also rooting for her, and with the right vision, this could be exploited to make a fantastic Han/Qi'ra trilogy. I definitely want, at the very least, a sequel movie. The writer should keep playing off the audience's anxieties about Qi'ra. Make her seem like the good guy for awhile, and let the naive romance between our heroes deepen and mature, but also keep building our anxieties about Qi'ra, for example perhaps it turns out that Darth Maul has given her some Dark Jedi training, seeking to make her into his apprentice. Details aside, the key to making a great trilogy would be increasing our sympathy for her character, while also making it increasingly clear that she's going to double-cross Han in the end. Have all these tensions could come to a head with final betrayal that represents the real reason Han trusts only himself, but also have a major reveal that allows the audience to see that, properly speaking, Qi'ra ""betrayal"" was really a final sacrifice play to save Han's life. So in the world of the movie, our remaining protagonist feels totally crushed, but as an audience we understand the Qi'ra's decisions were borne of her love for her childhood friend, who was the only one to look out for her during the darker times as street urchins and pawns of the organized crime world. If done well, the audience should end up kind of hating themselves for being so skeptical of Qi'ra intentions, when in retrospect, she turned out to be a remarkably selfless individual who was strangely resilient to the temptations of the Dark Side, but so cloaked in mystery that few managed to understand her true nature. The tragedy of the trilogy turns out not to be that Han was betrayed by his childhood friend, but rather, that he wasn't, yet believes that he was. To top it all off, it would be cool if Qi'ra was frozen into carbonite rather than killed outright, which, assuming that she's developed as a master spy with modest Force powers, could open up lots of interesting possibilities in a post-Rise-of-Skywalker world, especially if Qi'ra turns out to be the only being in existence to ever wield the Dark Side of the Force without ever being truly tempted by it. I'll let you use your imagination about where that could go.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

1906,mikebaker-55341,Finally!! A good Star Wars related movie,10,17 September 2020,"I said to my friend the other day ""I'm done with Star Wars"", because the last trilogy and other spin-offs have varied between mediocre at best (oh look another Death Star) to downright AWFUL (looking at you The Last Jedi).I didn't like Rebel One either; I thought it was visually beautiful but dreadfully cliched, predictable, and full of plot holes and such silly ideas that I felt like Sigourney Weaver in Galaxy Quest having a massive rant about the lack of logical sense. My friend told me that Solo was better than all of the recent films, so I decided to give it one last try before I gave up on them for good. I'm really happy that I did.Firstly, it felt original and new. OK yes there are some familiar items in there like the Millennium Falcon (even that is different though!), but generally there were new droids, new ships, different back-stories and interesting new characters. I thought Woody Harrelson and Amelia Clarke were great, and the story had exciting plots that made some sense alongside the great visuals. Thank god they didn't roll out C3PO going ""oh my!"" for the millionth time, nor did they spend half of the film referencing ""The Force"" like they had a quota to fill. The film felt much more grown up with peril that felt real and people making tough decisions in difficult situations which weren't predictable for the most part.If like me, you thought the latest ones looked pretty but got more and more lousy, nonsensical and unsatisfying then I'd definitely recommend this one instead as it's much more interesting and fun.

Well, I went in already knowing a little about the film and some of its twists, but not everything. What I did get spoiled on didn't take away from the film. I liked it. Yep. I liked the movie. It wasn't a mind blowing experience, but it was entertaining and honestly I feel even the guy playing Han played the part pretty well. If you are on the fence, give it a shot. It's not bad. I'm glad I saw it.I want to add that I COMPLETELY understand fan reluctance to see this. I understand that The Force Awakens and The Last Jedi were let downs for a lot of people. Over all for me, they were disappointing, but with some good stuff sprinkled in. I also understand people that might be boycotting this movie to make a point. They want better films than what we got from the current trilogy and I agree with them 100% that things could be done better. I'll say this. Rogue One and SOLO are solid films and I recommend them.

His overall acting is kind of cheesy and he doesn't have the unapologetic cocky sureness or comedic delivery of Harrison Ford--but then again, who does? Moreover, I think it's the script writers who haven't provided enough material for these characters. A basic rule in writing is, ""show, don't tell,"" and this was ignored in several scenes for the sake of trying to describe the characters' nuances and personalities. Characters should be developed through their acting, not by other characters telling the audience about their traits. So, the writing could be better. That said, Woody Harrelson saves this movie. He works his character's charm into the flat writing, and gives this movie some life. Good showings from Thandie Newton, Emilia Clark and Phoebe Waller-Bridge.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

1917,kjbrown92,If only they had a better Han....,6,24 June 2018,"It wasn't a terrible film. The plot was fine, the characters were fine, all except Han Solo - the MAIN CHARACTER. When there is good casting for re-do's of iconic characters, such as Chris Pine as James T. Kirk or Zachary Quinto as Spock, or even any of the James Bond actors (except the horribly Timothy Dalton), you accept them in the role. Throughout the entire Solo movie, I kept thinking ""he's not Han."" He didn't have the swagger, he didn't have the grin, he didn't have the attitude. I kept thinking he looked a little like Patrick Swayze, which wasn't helping me get into the movie.The action and special effects worked. The plotline filled in some history. There was a little problem with him saying he had no tribe or family (hence the Imperial Officer giving him the last name ""Solo"") but then later talks about his father and how he had been laid off from his job.... And it seemed more realistic when Finn deserted as a Stormtrooper than Han deserted as part of the Imperial army. But my main problem was definitely with the casting of Han.

As a space opera movie goes it's good, there's action, there's romance and there's aliens. The rolls were perfectly casted. I found Lando's droid rather annoying, Chewie was awesome as usual... As a Star Wars fan myself I think I expected a bit more, but then again my review is based on a single viewing at midnight on opening night. A lot of the Easter Eggs sort of went over my head as I've not really sat and watched Rebels or Clone Wars, maybe an understanding of those will help me enjoy it more?

Make your own mind up, and like me you may be very pleasantly surprised.With a lead character as well known and loved as Han Solo, so much of this film depended on whether we could believe Alden Ehrenreich was the man himself, and he passes with flying colours. Bolstered by his relationship with Glover's Lando, the two draw you in when they're on screen, they are interesting to watch and leave you wanting more. Donald Glover is having a period in his career where he can seemingly do no wrong, but I was a little worried that the characters portrayed would be impressions of what we know from Harrison Ford and Billy Dee Williams. This was not the case and the added bonus of some new, interesting characters made this film more than just mindless fun. Curiosity over where the story might take us lead to a few surprises in the film, which should serve fans well, without selling out with the aim just to please.I can't wait to see it again.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
1930,sonicdeviant,Way Better Than I Expected,7,8 July 2018,"Just got back from seeing this movie several weeks after its release. I waited so long because of the unrelenting, negative drumbeat from some sectors of SW's fandom. I must say that my son and I found it to be much better that we expected, considering all of the negativity out there. There were several laugh-out-loud moments that caught me off guard, and I think the principal actors did a great job of staying true to the characters-they're definitely believable as younger versions of Han and Lando. My opinion is that this movie is worthy of inclusion in SW canon, and it's worth it to see on the big screen (so go see it if you can). I believe-if you're waiting for the digital release-that you'll wish you had seen it in theaters, once you realize that some of the criticism has been over the top. I say this as someone who definitely had disappointments with The Last Jedi (primarily disappointed in the way Luke was portrayed).",Solo - A Star Wars Story

Well worth my time and money. All the new characters did a great job. I had some reservations about some of the better known actors in this film but I really thought everyone did a fantastic job.

The characters are interesting and have some real depth -- even when Han is being Han, it's believable. I love the backstory information and it was slipped in gracefully. It's a shame people are giving it bad reviews. It's so far superior to anything Lucas wrote and directed. His ideas were good -- his technique, not so much.

1938,jan-klerks-1,somewhere in between meh and okay,7,23 May 2018,"Technically this movie is about how Han Solo and Chewbacca got to team up, how Han got the Millennium Falcon, and about the birth of the rebellion. Now these are big moments in the Stars Wars saga, but unfortunately they are being rattled off in mere minutes in this movie. The bulk of what we're getting is how Han Solo made his bones as the good bad guy of the universe by teaming up with a group of hired robbers who owe debts which keep getting larger as they fail to deliver the promised goods. During the first few scenes, Han Solo's motive is being presented (a girl) after which the story kicks off with Solo already being the cocky skilled pilot as we have come to known him, and the movie will take it from there. In the end, Han and Chewy save the day for the good guys without getting to know them better than we already do.I'm not a huge Star Wars fan but I always liked how the franchise keep true to itself, and this movie does that in its own way. The movie contains all the well known ingredients of a likeable summer blockbuster against the backdrop of everything you are already familiar with.

I liked all the characters in their respective roles. Maybe a little shy on dialogue at times, but doesn't everyone want more action than talk nowadays? 
I'm a Stars Wars fan, but don't worship it like some. For these folks, it seems nothing but the original 3 will do. If you've decided to hate it before you see it, I think it would be tough for any film to turn that around.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
1942,dd-breeder,Solo: A Star Wars western,8,27 May 2018,"When I first watched the trailer, Ehrenreich gave me the impression of a guy whose acting skills are only capable of not letting me forget that he is actually playing in the movie I'm watching. But to my surprise he got into the character really well and managed to show us a young ambitions man doing any kind of dangerous stuff that gives him an opportunity to achieve what he wants and never missing the chance to do some reckless flying and make a pleasant joke in passing.There was an episode of imperial infantry attack on some war-torn planet where frightened Han was jumping from one trench to another while massive blaster fire was flashing over his head. He was surrounded by severe people completely soaked in sweat and covered by smoked dirt and they weren't thinking of how to defeat the whole planet. They were actually trying to survive the battle. That reminded me of how war really looks like. And this is the thing that tells a lot about Han Solo's movie - it's not another fancy pretentious tale about force, it lacks solving galaxy-wide problems and tells the story happening right now.The movie combines a few stories which perfectly match characters like Solo. It's about outlaws and adventurers where Solo is one of them with a kind heart but strong intentions. It's hard to get a big piece of a pie where anyone else is holding a knife but Solo will learn how to outwit his enemies and strike first. He isn't that experienced smuggler yet but he is definitely on the right way.Other characters serve the movie well too and show us how galaxy's lone wolves come together by chance and then go each own way. Woody Harrelson is charismatic as always and in couple with Donald Glover and Chewie does deliver a lot of cool action moments and humor. But the most controversial character is surprisingly Elthree who is an SJW-crazed robot making sarcastic comments about robot's rights and human relationship. If you think about Korg from Thor Ragnarok when you hear the word ""revolution"", now you'll probably remember her ""Re-be-lli-on!"" instead.Is this company worth watching the movie? Definitely.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

I didn't care for the comic relief robot this time around however. L3 is nowhere near as likable as K2 was. I was genuinely sad when he died. L3 felt like they just had to shoehorn in some sort of comedy. She's no Jar-Jar, but not real far off. I'm not at all disappointed with the movie.

I did watch this film, but it was with great hesitancy, because the last film was so far off course that it ruined the franchise for millions of us life-long Star Wars fans. This lesson put you $100 million in the red for the total budget for this film but if you learn from your mistakes and find a way to salvage what's left of this series, it will be money well spent. Don't let idiots like Rian cost you hundreds of millions of box office dollars anymore.

Unfortunately, every Star Wars movie from here on out will be tainted by the fact that Disney's attached because of uptight cynical trolls. As if Star Wars has never been about making money. I had Star Wars toys, sheets, lunch boxes, Burger King glasses, shampoo, coffee mugs, coloring books and Christmas ornaments, in the 70's! Personally think all of the Disney released films have been superior to the prequel trilogy in every way. Some even better than ""Jedi"" From scripts to acting to special affects. (Disclaimer: I've seen each of the prequel films at least 10 times. Jokes on me I guess.) And while the original Star Wars was ground breaking,it objectively, is not the greatest film ever made. Hell, even the actors involved were dubious.
 So, I'm still going to enjoy these movies. No, it's not ""my Star Wars"", as some whiners have exclaimed, but I'm not 10 years old anymore either. I'm also not some old troll that's gonna throw a hissy fit when there's a person of color or a woman kicking ass in a galaxy that has a trillion species in it or if my crazy YouTube fan theories don't make it into the movies.

1966,cmk3001-26-836106,A fun time at the movies,8,16 July 2018,"It's a lighter Star Wars movie than usual, but it's definitely one of the most fun. Cast was good across the board. Cinematography, special effects, music, I thought everything was top notch. Pacing is occasionally awkward, but nothing too serious. I love it when people say this movie didn't need to be made. No s***, Sherlock. No movie needs to be made. What kind of nonsensical argument is that? They could have stopped with New Hope and just had a single movie if they wanted to. My god, there are so many triggered, ""purist"", basement lord fanboys leaving 1 star reviews on here cause every movie that isn't New Hope or Empire Strikes Back is the worst movie ever.

It's why I've loved SciFi since the 5th grade (about 40 damn years ago!): lovable space cowboy that we know deep down has the heart of gold. Fun and loyal friends and enemies. Great FX. Great costumes. One-Liners to steal in RL. It has rockets but it ain't rocket science. It's religion in it's most entertaining form.
I loved it. L.O.V.E.D it. It's now #4 my SW favorites list. Do yourself a favor and go enjoy the ride. The Kessel Run Was worth the $8 to see it Thursday night and it'll be worth at least another $16 while still in the theatres and the $15.99 when I can buy it from Amazon.

Yet another rushed into movie without any actual effort put into the script. If they took the time with this and actually invested some time and passion this could of been a great movie.

The beginning 10 minutes was a bit slow, but humor is there and the rest of the movie was very Solo. A lot of what was introduced in the first trilogy was answered (Kessel run, the Falcon's design, etc.). I know there will be people who judge it because it wasn't what THEY wanted.

Rian Johnson butchered that movie, and they made a huge mistake by not using Lawrence Kasden (I believe that is his name) to help write the screenplay for the movie. I hope they make one or two sequels to add to this movie. Also, I was afraid that the new actor they found to play Solo would not do a good job replacing Harrison Ford as a younger solo, but I actually liked him in the movie and thought he did a great job!

That was one of the charms of original Han Solo is he chose to give up his underworld life to help the Rebellion - and mainly to get closer to Leia. The old Han was a bad guy turned good; this Han is a good guy acting like a bad guy. Maybe they're saying that's what he was all along. Still it's a good movie.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

I loved how they matched everything from Han's and Chewy's Characters in the original triplogy to little details that were mentioned in the originals that were perfectly included in Solo. I am still complaining about the last Star Wars movie we were given, The Last Jedi. I didn't hate the Last Jedi but I am still dissappointed in the story and the direction they went with the characters especially Luke. I was so let down by the Last Jedi. I went into Solo with somewhat low expectations. I'm truly happy to say that watching Solo was a delight and it completely put me back to the first time I saw episodes 4, 5 and 6. It's a great Star Wars story. Thank you to great writing and great directing! It can be done! and still be Star Wars!

1984,army_erik,Good entertainment (when you lower your expectations),7,6 June 2018,"I suspect most people who give this less than three stars have just decided to hate the movie. Be wary of reviews that mentions 'Disney', and how they brought down Star Wars.It may be that all the negative reviews lowered my expectations so much that I ended up enjoying myself, but I had a great time.If you watch 'Solo' with the mindset that you are about to see a movie intended for 12 year old boys (which the whole Star Wars saga really is), you might like it.If you expect to get the same feeling you did when you watched 'A New Hope' when you were twelve yourself, you will be disappointed. If you expect Ehrenreich to resemble Ford, you will be dissapointed.The plot wasn't comletely shabby, and most characters had fairly believable motivations for acting the way they did. That's about as good as you can expect form Hollywood these days.(Disclaimer: I did watch it in 3-D at a really good IMAX movie theater. That of course helped giving me a great experience. I am not impressed by fancy CGI by itself, though, so the movie also has other qualities.)",Solo - A Star Wars Story

Han was portrayed so well that I was surprised. I thought the guy could never play off Harrison Ford's Han, but I'm very happy with it. The story was fun too! I think others' bad reviews are based on anger towards the studios stretching Star Wars out to keep making more and more money, which I agree with, but I have to admit when I like something. I'm a Star Wars nerd/lover so I feel like I judge pretty harshly. I was pleasantly surprised especially after the last Star Wars movie letdown.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

And I loved it.Even after having invested so much in the great storytelling of the Expanded Universe (Zahn's original Heir trilogy, for instance) and being a bit saddened the films never went that direction, I loved 'Solo'.

The only exception to that is the cameo near the end with an old villain. So if you never watched the Clone Wars and/or Rebels cartoon series you might be thinking to yourself ""...ahhhh, isn't he suppose to be dead?"" No, he survived and has been busy building a criminal underground army.It's a fun movie that has some humor in it but not forced like and all the time like TLJ, very well paced, acted, generally made sense for the casual Star Wars fan, and had moments for the more hard core ones as well.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
1994,p-masrom,Would have been so much better as a tv series.,7,26 May 2018,"It's Star Wars (period) It has that ""George Lucas Feel"" to it. If you're a fan you'll Like this movie. Emphasis on ""like"" because you'll probably not love this film. There is just way to much stuff happening and thus feels extremely rushed. In Rogue One there is a nicely confined story with the ultimate goal of telling us - the audience - what happend obtaining the plans for the deathstar over the span of 133 min. ""Solo"" on the other hand is a very generic summary of the up and coming Millennium Falcon swashbuckler Han Solo. The 135 min movie merely portrays some highlights up until a certain point in Solo's life, which Disney thinks will warrant a sequel... which it doesn't (in my opinion). These stories should support the saga, like rogue one. Another thing I don't like about this way of storytelling, that it lacks a goal for the audience. This lack of defined storytelling doesn't allow me to get grabbed by the film. It's really like: Ah nice one, check, what's next, ah nice, etc...Solo is the summary of Solo's life and we get most the stuff we need to know. There is probably just one story left to tell that we need to know to support the saga. However Disney is hinting at an entire new storyline for Han... (and us) And in my eyes that's just a money grab... Therefor this film would have been better cut into like 4 sections of 90 mins and aired on HBO with maybe a second season, than condensed in a 2 hour sitting with a probable sequel. So heck yeah it was entertaining and you should definitely watch, but if you're reading this to find out if you should spend your money on a movie ticket to go see this, go see another movie.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

I'd rate it about a 6 out of 10....But then when they reach a sandy planet about halfway through the movie, it really seemed to shift in tone: the action was a little snappier, the dialogue was better, even the guy playing Han Solo seemed to become a better actor! I have to think that maybe this is the point where Ron Howard took over...There was a twist in the story - actually two or three of them - near the end of the movie that genuinely caught me off-guard, and left me much more impressed with the movie. And the closing few minutes of the movie were not only funny, but heart-warming. I'd call the second part of the movie a 9 out of 10!Of all the Disney Star Wars movies, I'd say I enjoyed this one the most. It's too bad it's doing poorly at the box office, because the ending left me wanting more. This movie was set up with a new villain revealed at the end and a lot more story to tell; if they made a sequel to any of the new Star Wars movies, it's this one that I'd want them to continue.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

However, I am happy to report that Solo: A Star Wars story is one of the most enjoyable films I have viewed in a long time. It's good, it's not brilliant but it's not poor either. Alden Ehrenreich does a fantastic job attempting to capture the character of Han Solo in his performance, a feat that is by no means an easy task considering the footsteps he had to follow in. The same can be said for Donald Glover, whose performance as Lando is near perfect. The first twenty minutes are messy, but once the train heist begins, the movie flows much better. The characters of Beckett, Enfys Nest, Qi'ra and Dryden Vos are interesting and each may surprise you, Rio is a character who is smart mouthed and fun, whilst Val was of little interest to me, as for Lando's droid L3-37... the less said the better. Overall, given the conditions the film endured regarding directors during production, Solo is enjoyable and my no means a weak entry in the star wars franchise.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

I was very hesitant going into this film as Han Solo is one of the greatest characters of all time and after what Disney did to Luke... I was worried... Very Worried!Fortunately, this film was beyond brilliant. I adored this experience! It felt like that fun, adventurous space opera that Star Wars is. Star Wars for me is about the characters and the incredible situations and scenarios that they encounter along the way, at least that's one of thousands of perfect things about Star Wars. We get so many brilliant situations and moments throughout this two hour ride. It reminds us as the audience why we love film. I think the cast were great and our young Han Solo was very good in the role.The humour was balanced very nicely within a well written and interesting script. None of it felt forced at all. Also another thing that I find very good about this story is that at no point does this film want to throw and kind of political subjects at the audience, it handles everything with great dignity and respects that this is a fantasy film in it's own universe.The film was a blast from start to finish with a great sense of humour, and also some wonderful surprises along the way that I won't spoil! We also get some explanation of such things as Han's name (while this was weak, I felt it at least was done well within that moment) and how Han won the Millennium Falcon.
I was so pleased with this film and I really hope that Disney can work from this in future instalments.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
2012,andrewzwalters,"Really quite good, but not exceptional action movie",8,17 September 2018,"No big spoilers but fate of some characters can be inferred.
An exhilarating, pretty much non stop action Movie, but you might want to save it for a flight, Characters are relatable and plot and script push along generally keeping you engaged, although I skipped through some action sequences. I'm not fond of prequels as predictably there is no jeopardy for some of the characters. 
The actor struggles to have the gravitas of Harrison Ford and there is a little of squeaky american stereotypical idealistic kid about him. This grates a little with the measured moral ambivalence of Solo as we meet him in Star Wars.
I liked the feminist robot social justice warrior, the scene with ""her"" freeing other droids in one of the heists is one of my favorites in the Movie, Emilia Clark is magnetic, Glover and Harrelson too compensating for slightly wet Solo. the villain could be stronger as well, Nicely set up for sequel particularly with Emilia Clarke developing the range of her character and Alden Ehrenreich just about keeping up in the end. It won't happen due to significant fandom who have taken against it mainly on political grounds

2016,marc-antoine222,Just another action movie BUT HERE IS WHY I LIKED IT,7,27 May 2018,"SOLO doesn't feel much like a Star Wars movie although its universe is well anchored in Lucas' series. In fact, the whole rebellion, empire, force, sabers, senate, etc is but a whispered background info. Fans might get disappointed here.It has lots of flaws and imperfections, some sprinkled clichés, a Chris Pratt main character and his favorite wookie Groot.BUT. For once the fight is not about Good vs Evil. I'm not too fond of black and white stories to say the least and while some people may argue that in TLJ, Prince Zuco Ren presents the duality within him, it still is Light versus Dark, the good guys against the mean villains. Here, SOLO brings outlaws versus outlaws versus outlaws. Some of them may have nobler intentions, but each fight for a personal cause (for a girl, individual freedom, power, richness, rebellion, droid rights) remaining more faithful to human nature than other Star Wars films. There is even a train robbery, reminiscing of the American western genre, its outlaws and where gold coins are replaced with coaxium.Plus, instead of working out a classic love story between two good looking characters, it starts right off the bat with it and then blurs the relationship with tension. Some of the betrayals are cliché, but until the very end you're not sure in which camp she lies. At first, I predicted that Dryden Vos would not be dead for real, rising instead to kill her, making Han a tragic lonely hero seen over and over. That did not happen, you earn a point there, SOLO.And lastly, the action was exhilarating tbh. I'm by no means an action movie fan, but I enjoyed the ride. The characters' fate seemed to go worse by the minute and I kinda liked the overkill combo Lava black hole + space kraken + coaxiom heating + closing diamond escape + power loss + coaxiom not fueling the ship, making my butt cheeks clench enough to turn bolts into a Childish Gambino CD.Not bad! 7/10",Solo - A Star Wars Story
2017,dj-danielwright,A fun ride for the most part.,7,24 May 2018,"Fun adventure with a few problems. Not as much character development as I would have hoped for. Some good links to future adventures and events. Han is good. Lando is amazing. Chewie is great and the rest of the cast are ok. Fun action scenes throughout. There are some moments that slow down the pace to much, which for took me out of it at times. All in all I had fun with Solo which I think casual Star Wars fans will enjoy more then us die hard fans. 7/10",Solo - A Star Wars Story
2018,boyomanchini,Enjoyable visit to the Star Wars universe,7,2 June 2018,"A New Hope is one of my favourite films with Rogue One up there as well but I went into Solo with an open mind. My overall feeling is that the script in the first 30 mins or so is poor but then the film hits its strides and delivers some excellent set pieces. Han, although can never be Mr Ford, came across well and provided the chemistry with Chewie that was needed. A solid, fun history of one of the best loved characters.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

If you went in expecting an A New Hope, then you shouldn't be surprised that that's not what it was. Solo is merely meant to be one small part in an anthology, and it does a great job at what it was meant to do. Highly recommend",Solo - A Star Wars Story

This feeling had started with Ep. VII. and now reached its peak with Solo. When you sell your imagination's rights to a company(aka Lucasfilm to Disney), it is going to give it further to several directors', screenwriters' etc. hands and you are going to get a movie like this one here, where:too much kissing and love story is the main reason they explain a character's motivations withsmugglers are actually rebelsno REAL smugglers in the movieno bounty hunters (not even the one you hoped, just a mandalorian armor as an easter egg...)easter eggs about rebelling... who cares? where are the smugglers and where is the movie which could have shown this world between the Empire and Rebels?A HUGE spoiler of the next SW Story movie because this movie hasn't had anything .... they had to spoiler a big thing here... pathetic.

2021,nathaniel-faulls,An exhilarating blast of a film. Nonstop excitement. Brilliant humor. I loved this Star Wars Story!,10,25 May 2018,"The characters are all a joy to follow.
Alden Ehrenreich takes on the role of Han and makes it his own while staying true to the iconic quips, expressions, and personality that made Harrison Ford's Solo so magnetic.
Donald Glover seriously becomes Lando. The voice, the charm, the swagger, the capes! To see Glover give a seamless Lando is such a satisfying delivery for someone such as me who has been anticipating seeing him in this role for a long time.
Woody Harrelson, Emilia Clarke, and Phoebe Waller-Bridge each individually dazzle in their roles. There is so much to their characters to where they each could carry their own Star Wars Stories and they would all be really captivating.
The introduction of Han and Chewie's relationship in the story was solid. Their dynamic is as entertaining and endearing as always.Lawrence & Jon Kasdan wrote such a smart script. Ron Howard swooped in and brought it to life wonderfully. The tone is fresh, fun, and full.
John Powell's score is clever and new, while fittingly harkening to classic leitmotifs at specific connective story moments.This is a Star Wars movie unlike any of the others in some huge ways. It was a bold move for Lucasfilm to take one of the most iconic movie characters of all time, recast him, and tell us his origins in a standalone film. They managed to take a story that we never thought we needed and made it extremely satisfying and complementary to Han Solo, Chewbacca, Lando, and the Star Wars universe as a whole.This movie also managed to completely shock with some huge reveals and surprises that had me speechless and ecstatic. This film has taken brave new steps into canon connectivity that has me excited for whatever cards Lucasfilm has up their sleeve for upcoming anthology films. I love it.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
2022,webby88-423-139036,Like watching a Star Wars spin-off made for TV,4,29 May 2018,"After thoroughly enjoying Rougue One, more so than TFA, I was hoping for a repeat performance with this movie, particularly as it is about one of the very best Star Wars legends.
Unfortunately it didn't deliver for me. The issue not being that events appearing in the movie which all Star Wars fans would have wanted to see were missing... far from it. How did Han meet Chewie? How did he get behind the controls of the Falcon? Where is he from? What about Lando? Any other well known Cameos? They were all covered... and a few more to boot! Even the acting is pretty good.
The problem... it didn't feel like a blockbuster movie. It felt made for TV. Not enough Epic Space scenes. It felt cheap.
Where was the grip of evil looming over the film like a cloud... as in every other?
The story was appalling.. it was just a checklist of events... Disney has failed here.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
2023,nathanael_moore,"Loosen your tight ""mega fan"" force-grip on Star Wars, and you might just enjoy these new films!",7,25 May 2018,"Sometimes I wonder if the people who write the IMDb user reviews even saw the same film as I did. I love Star Wars as much as the next nerf herder or Kowakian lizard monkey, and will gladly discuss at length the minutiae of the offical and unofficial canon. Like the multitudes, the impact Star Wars had on my life was foundational to many interests and career goals I have now as an adult. It's a big deal for a lot of people.So when a new Star Wars film comes out, I get a bit anxious that it won't deliver the same impact as the original trilogy did. There were many risks taken. With ""Solo"", I knew already that it was going to be a different cast to any of the original films - being a prequel - and a different story compared to the SW Extended Universe books I read religiously as a kid. That's fine, I'm cool with Lucasfilm wanting to reboot the canon. I knew Alden Ehrenreich wouldn't look exactly like Harrison Ford, and that the casting of Han might have worked better with someone like Anthony Ingruber. Again, sure, as long as it works, maybe Alden would blow us all away. I knew it had a lot of production issues and Lucasfilm fired the original directors and then had to bring in none other than Ron Howard to finish what Phil Lord and Christopher Miller started. Sure, I guess that needed to be done. So, all that said, I went to see Solo and tried really hard to suspend any doubts I had - and I came out relieved. I enjoyed this film. It probably doesn't rank as good as Rogue One, but it's no Attack of the Clones either. I like the new characters that were introduced, especially the droid L3-37 - who I think is probably the most interesting new character in the film (some of her dialogue was great, even if she does sound like Captain Phasma...). Alden did a pretty great job at playing Han Solo, he didn't seem to be trying to mimic Harrison Ford's acting or voice, and that was a good idea because that might have gotten annoying after a while. The story seemed a bit patchy, but generally made sense, but I'm sure some lines of dialogue were spoken a bit too fast and contributed to not knowing exactly what was going on. But, as soon as I saw Chewbacca on screen, I couldn't help thinking that this movie should have really been about him. We all kind of know Han's story - smuggler, pirate, dashing rogue - but we kind of know nothing about Chewie. I liked seeing Chewie in his prime, brawling guards, ripping limbs off, and losing at Dejarik. I felt at times that Han was the sidekick to Chewie's story. There were some great action scenes, especially flying the Falcon around Kessel. I found some of the sets to be too claustrophobic or a rehash of others we've seen before (just how many critical plot point space casino/bars filled with bizarrely dressed patrons are there?) And without mentioning any spoilers, I particularly liked the subtle nods to the other Star Wars films throughout Solo.All said and done, I really enjoyed this film. It's worth seeing, especially if you're a fan. But you'll probably enjoy it more, and other recent Star Wars iterations, if you hold Star Wars a bit loosely without the fear of losing a precious piece of your childhood. No one can take away what the originals did or were, and it's a hard task to match their greatness. It wouldn't matter which direction future Star Wars instalments go, there's bound to be a mob of angry fans hating loudly in a corner of the internet. I'm not one of them. :)",Solo - A Star Wars Story

Can not think of a dull moment! I would say this is up there with Rogue One and a lot better than The Last Jedi. I would recommend people ignore what they read (including this) and just go and see it.,Solo - A Star Wars Story
2032,santek-d,Lack of Imagination,5,6 June 2018,"Solo feels really unnecessary.THE STORY is so uninventive that is actually hurts. With so much profit why is Disney finding it hard to find writers who don't lean on the this world known? It is supposed to be a galaxy far far away yet it seems all the troubles of our world are squeezed in SW movies to make them more relevant? Make them feel more home? All it actually does is make all the causes in the movie extremely cringey to audience, jokeable and unwatchable and in this movie it is the L3 droid - a cringey, angry black woman stereotype made into a droid with a mind of its own. I mean come on Disney how old are your writers and what audience are you targeting? What made the original trilogy so great was the imagination of few with NOT a bottom-less pit budget - it maybe gave as ewoks but also gave us so much more heart that no CGI can create. And of course it is all in the details so...the trenches, the clothes hangers, Tobias Beckett (name) and so on? feels too this worldly = no imagination whatsoever.
The plot is too safe, too simple, too depending on ''cute'' things we know form tOT. The dialog is so forced and with predictable set ups, cringey jokes and well, L3. The love interests, oh how much I would like to delete all the scenes of giggly romance we don't need. Sure we had them before but it is all in the feeling of them not being too forced merely the quirks of the characters. And also, party scenes, why do they feel so unbelievable even I can't tell.THE CHARACTERS
Leia was the sassy not your usual princess. She didn't mind working hard for a cause and she was not portrayed as an idyllic female, she was irritated, short tempered and had a lot of sass with a lot of kindness when needed. Not the Mary Sue Rey is made into or an unforgettable character of Qi'ra we don't really care about at all. At all. Too much protagonist is not an equation for a witty movie.
The casting of Lando seemed perfect since announced and it was ( if we erase the running for L3 scene it would be great since the Lando we know is good at being smart and responsible for others too) . Alden actually did a decent job portraying Han (the moves, the quirks, the smirk) but also when seen it feels even more unnecessary since there really is nobody with that much charisma. They can all be grateful at how lucky they got in tOT with Harrison.
Overall casting is really bad. Too much famous actors also don't bring anything good to the franchise. Hard to connect, even harder to care.THE CONNECTION
The Kessel run, the Han-Chewie, the Han-Lando, The Han-smuggler and all other stories are all squeezed in a week of his life. Really? Han-Chewie story feels really flat since Chewbacca is nothing the character we see in tOT or even Episode III( when we see he is Yoda's friend). Let us not forget the past, can we do that Disney? The Han-Lando story was the best part of the movie, it seemed alden and donald have a sense of what their ''relationship'' is all about and like. I actually wanted more of that in this movie. Han-smuggler story, all I can say is okay. ''shrugs shoulders''.
What troubles me is the connection Disney is desperately trying to make to SW past and their present animated series. Milking the cow called ''fan love for Darth Maul '' has already been too much to handle in the dearly missed clone wars animated series and in THIS movie it is the most forced, unnecessary scene in the movie. Such a shame what they all have done to this character.THE SOUNDTRACK
There is absolutely no doubt that one of the most important things in SW is the music. Why, oh why, did half of the soundtrack in this movie felt like it was borrowed from ''Lion king''? Just had to mention this as it was really disappointing.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
2033,fthsyankeegent,Never Tell Him The Odds,9,27 May 2018,"This is possibly one of the best Star Wars movies to date.

2034,ladean626,"Fans will enjoy this one, it's fun. Really.",8,28 May 2018,"So after getting totally disappointed by the mess that was The Last Jedi, I went into Solo with the ""expect the worst, hope for the best"" attitude and I am so happy to say that my husband and I (hardcore Star Wars junkies since the 80s) thought this movie was highly entertaining - enjoyable and fun and thoughtful in the Han Solo plot points it chose to explore and storytell for the fans.We debated if we wanted the movie to get into the famed Kessel Run because in the fans' folklore and imaginations, it was always fun to theorize what the backstory was there. Without spoilers, I will just say I think fans will be pleased with how it all goes down. The revered Falcon backstory is awesome too. The casting was great, all fine actors in this group. The action, dialogue, scenery/planets, and plot I thought were quite good and it really made me realize that the two anthology stories (Rogue One and Solo) were far superior and more satisfying to me as a fan than episodes 7 and 8. The social justice warrior BS that was forced down our throats in TLJ almost turned me off to the whole thing, sadly.Those fans who know every factoid and great one-liner from our beloved Han Solo will really enjoy the references and nexuses made in this movie, we found ourselves smiling and laughing way more than we had anticipated. I will absolutely recommend this one. It wasn't perfect (super unrealistic ""feminist"" droid that doesn't quite work in the canon of droid behavior), but it left me feeling satisfied and happy that they treated Han's backstory with some reverence and respect. Go see it.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

I consider myself a fan boy and enjoyed Solo immensely. I concur, Solo has a sluggish start, but when you talk about establishing a back story for such a beloved character, clearly the movie crew did not want to miss anything. The characters are lovable, the story is intense and fun, the special effects are flawless. If I had to complain about anything it's that a few of the jokes felt forced; but hey, Star Wars is suppose to have a little bit of the ""campy"" feel to it, I believe. Oh, and THAT cameo at the end!

The story is good, I liked it. I had a Star Wars ""feeling"" in the cinema what I didn't feel during the I-III and VII-VIII episodes.

2039,Tylershepard96,A Blast From The Past,10,25 May 2018,"SPOILER: In my opinion, this prequel film was a mind-blowing, adventurous experience. It is really aimed more towards the hardcore fans than the casual fans or someone who is just getting into Star Wars. A lot of references that were in books, tv shows and minor characters that only show up a second in the movie like it mentioned how Aurra Sing died, had a few mentions of planets that weren't in the movies and my personal favorite, Darth Maul who is voiced by none other than Sam Witwer.
Alden Ehrenreich does a fantastic job as Han Solo, he doesn't match Harrison Ford as Han but that's good because it gives them the ability to develope the character. Donald Glover was also great as playing Lando Calrissian and I really believed I was watching Han and Lando on the big screen.I loved every minute of it and I seriously recommend watching this.

2048,brian-oesterling,The only people who rate this movie badly are generic SW fans,9,28 May 2018,"I went into this movie with very low expectations based off of how much I disliked Force Awakens and Last Jedi. Those new films in the series didn't feel like SW movies because you could tell they were just trying to cash in on nostalgia and added in dumb things that seemed to cheapen SW in my eyes (such as Leia using the force to fly through space, Ackbar being killed unceremoniously for no reason, and adding in all these new alien species instead of keeping fan favorites like Twi'leks and Rodians, etc.). But Solo was different. There were so many little Easter eggs that only longtime fans of the series would pick up on and I FINALLY felt that they made a movie for us SW nerds. Most of the bad reviews I've been seeing are people complaining about how it ""didn't stay true to the series"" or that it ""was just another cash grab with cheap thrills"" but none of these reviews mentioned all of the little things that made this film a good start for Disney's SW redemption. Literally every question I ever had about Han was answered in this film, and none of it felt cheap to me. It explained why he doesn't trust people, how he got the Falcon, his rocky relationship with Lando, how he and Chewy became close, where he got his name, how he's so good at piloting, and where he acquired his over-confidence. It was a great origin story in my opinion. Also, as a huge ""Clone Wars"" fan, I was absolutely ECSTATIC seeing they finally acknowledged Maul being alive and still pulling the strings of crime syndicates. I believe they added him in not only as a service to long-time fans such as myself that appreciate the continuity, but as a possible set-up for a stand alone Obi-Wan film, which EVERY SW fan should be excited about. So once again, based off of everything I just explained, I believe that the only people who rate this film badly are those who didn't pick up on all these little things, or people who are just casual fans. If you love SW and have read some of the novels or watched ""Clone Wars"" then this is the movie for you.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

2058,sorab,Fun and funny. Just expect a fun movie and you will not be disappointed,7,2 July 2018,"Went into this with an open mind and came out thinking it was a fun ride with a good amount of laughs.The special effects are good, the acting is good, but it fell flat at some crucial moments.Alden is fine as Han Solo, but it takes too long to accept him as a young Harrison Ford. Casting him was a bit of a PR issue from the start because of the fan blowback, but he is a good actor and ultimately pulls it off but the other actor who has played young Harrison Ford in the past would have been better (Anthony Ingruber).Lots of funny lines and good writing. Some genuinely exciting scenes as well. Woody Harrelson is excellent in his role.The critical weaknesses (spoilers):
The opening ""exciting"" scene where Han turns the landspeeder on its side to get through a tight space is old and cliche. No excitement there AT ALL. We've seen this maneuver in countless car chase movies since the 1970's so this came off as lame and derivative. This become a big flaw later in the movie when he does the same move with the falcon getting through a tight space-- even though we've seen it in other star wars movies so many times. They build it up like it is so clever and brilliant, but it is old and tired. If they just let it play out with no fake build up it would have been all right.The other critical weakness for me was the emotional impact of the ""death"" of L3. It's a robot. Lando (Danny Glover) emotionally cradling the machine's hardware as if it is a dying human is foolish and is simply trying to get an emotional reaction from the audience. There is no such emotional connection because any viewer knows the machine can be repaired and rebooted. There is no real sense of loss and that is a failure by the writers (Kasdan). It should have been a short bit where it is acknowledged that it is a shame the machine is busted, with Lando wisely taking the memory portion to resurrect it in the ship. Not a sappy good bye on a battlefield.The villain is well done and the relationship between Han and his old flame is pretty good.  Like any prequel or originating story, there is a ack of genuine feelings of jeapardy for the main characters you know will survive because they appear in the other films. We know Chewy, Han and Lando will survive. The writers wisely create other excitement with the other/new characters we come to care about.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
2059,lmolby,Should have been Caleissian: A Star Wars story,7,7 January 2019,"I would have preferred this movie if it were the Lando Calrissian story. Childish Gambino and his droid L3 were great! Emelia Clarke was great! Woody Haralson was better in Planet if the Apes and Alden whatever his name was worse than Leonardo Dicaprio was in Tatanic.It's not often that an entire move's success rests on a casting choice, but maybe it is. Alden Eichenreich is too short, too Meely mouthed, not swashbuckling and not worthy as Han Solo. Chewbacca was more dynamic. I'm not really saying Alden is a bad actor. I'm saying he's a bad Han Solo. And that leads to the crux of this films weakness. Who else would be a good Han Solo? I bet Chris Evans would have been a better choice.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

2061,michaelferber-688-265761,Great Movie!,9,22 November 2018,"I'm old enough to have actually seen all the original films in the theatre, and I just say That Solo, is completely undeserving the negative criticism that has been bandied about. The original movies will never be able to be recreated at an equal level. This movie is as close as anyone is ever gonna get.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
2062,pascaljohnson16,A Bit of Hope Restored,8,28 May 2018,"After the horror that was ""The Last Jedi"", I have to confess that my hopes for this film were limited. I am THAT level of Star Wars fan, that even today, with a demanding job and barely any time on my hands, I will still go through the novels and try to achieve maximum preparation before each new Star Wars film (the trick: audio books - listen on the go, haha). The Last Shot, sort of touted as the lead-in novel for this film, was decent but not spectacular. But it served to get me in the zone.
What really gave me some optimism regarding this film was the cast. With Woody Harrelson, Emilia Clarke, and the likable Donald Glover supporting a young non-Harrison Ford as Han Solo, I figured that this actually could work.
To my surprise, it did. Yeah, Han Solo is not the jaded cynic we all know and love here, but keep in mind that he's supposed to be in his late teens (maybe just having hit 20?). He probably wasn't born jaded. There is a scene in the movie that should serve as great fan service and show how, all said and done, Han Solo is becoming less idealistic and more of a space pirate.
In the end, the movie really delivers, with less of the forced jokes that seem to be all the rage nowadays (see Marvel movies and the Episodic Star Wars films), a cast the brings a lot of heart to the plot, and some standout sequences that really left me on the edge of my seat. I encourage people to watch it and to go into it with the understanding that this is not Han Solo in his late twenties, but Han Solo as little more than a kid, just getting started. 
That in mind, it's a damn fun ride!",Solo - A Star Wars Story
2063,wlefbom,Best Star Wars film in quite a while,8,15 February 2019,Very pleasantly surprised.I like it better than any of the recent Star Wars movies or rogue one or any of those,Solo - A Star Wars Story
2064,elimorrison98,Great movie!,8,18 June 2018,I usually don't leave reviews to movies but I enjoyed Solo very much. I went in with very low expectations because of other reviews I saw but it was an extremely fun movie. It starts a little slow but the last 45 minutes packed all the action and suspense you could want in a movie. It's not the greatest Star Wars movie ever but it was definitely worth the watch in the theater,Solo - A Star Wars Story
2065,evan4893,Best Star Wars Movie since Episode III,9,25 May 2018,"I gave this a 9 (even though I think it's an 8) because a bunch of people unrightfully so gave it an unjustifiable low rating like a 1 or 2 which (as a filmmaker and a reviwer) is laughable. To start off this is better than The Force Awakens, The Last Jedi, & Rogue One. The cinematography was darker, more gritty and had almost a post modern noir feel at times with all of the beautiful silhouettes and shadows. The cast was strong, and it stuck true to the original movies while staying original and relevant at the same time. This isn't a jedi movie or a normal star wars film, it's Solo movie, so remember this going into it. While it's overall story may not have a huge impact on the overall story, it respects them more than the other recent films. I'm a fan of Ron Howard's directing and the different tone of this film and how he balanced the past one's, while stayinf relevant & original at the same time.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
2066,jleach24,"Great movie - Well done, and pieces things together with a twist",9,25 May 2018,"I really enjoyed this movie. From start to finish there was constant at least mild action. I took my 13 year old son for the 10 pm showing. He stayed awake to the very end and enjoyed it quite a bit as well, where he fell asleep during The Last Jedi at the same time slot. We both enjoyed it the most of any of the Disney Star wars films including Rogue One which is our 2nd favorite. More fun than the Last Jedi, and the actors/actresses are more believable in their roles than The Force Awakens. Don't let all the Star Wars nerds/fan boys scare you away from this movie, if you are a general sci fi fan, and a fan of the originals, you will enjoy this movie. It gives the average star wars fan, whom maybe doesn't still have an Empire Strikes Back poster on his wall, or didn't dress up like a storm trooper for the movie, details on how Han got his name, where he came from, how he met Chewy, why the MF is so special, and how the rebellion grew amongst other things. Of course some of those things were mentioned in the orignal trilogy, but you get to see the details, of how Han uses his cunning, and guile to survive and thrive in a universe where there are monsters 5x as strong as him, and others that know the force, or have powerful allies.And of course the ending. LOVED IT...Go see it !",Solo - A Star Wars Story
2067,arina-suonpera,Just an adventure movie,5,28 December 2018,"This was just a running around, shooting flying/racing and double crossing people - kind of movie. Not much relation to the first 6 ones. I think Emilia Clarke is way too recognizable and not very suitable for this kind of role, and Han Solo's actor - I just can't see Han solo in him, he didn't deliver it for me, no charisma at all, just some dude.
This could have been a good movie. Feels like 10-14yo kids would enjoy it way more than the older generation, there is nothing to appreciate.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
2068,janus-26,"Great adventure movie in SW universe, finally!",9,26 June 2018,"I'm a fan of Star Wars saga and I really enjoyed watching this movie.
It reminds original SW series, where good plot, great story, convincing characters played more important role than fast paced scenes full of CGI effects (which I consider more like a disease of contemporary films...).",Solo - A Star Wars Story
2069,whwf,4 star wars fans enjoyed solo,8,5 June 2018,Three friends and I have gone to every Star Wars Movie since the series began in the late 70's. We recently went to Solo with moderate expectations due to some less positive reviews. We all agreed that Solo was an entertaining movie. This is an enjoyable episode in the series. We all left satisfied and happy that we had not missed this movie. Four thumbs up!!,Solo - A Star Wars Story
2070,justaprilia,Love this movie this along with rogue one it's exceptional,10,22 September 2018,I don't understand all the bad reviews considering me in my 30's find this comes along with all the answers so han solos past from the start to finish this movie was excellent the casts or well-suited for the play role. I definitely recommend this movie to anyone who knows the old Star Wars this movie and Rogue one are the best movies that have come out of Disney it's sad that there separate in a way from the main series but they're perfect in their own way. It would be nice even though we've had it in the past that they retell the story of Luke.,Solo - A Star Wars Story
2071,bryan_braidwood,Phantom Menace - Part II,5,24 May 2018,"SPOILER: Solo: A Star Wars Story really should do what the title suggests, but alas I left the theatre a tad disappointed.As the title of this review eludes to, the similarities between this and the Phantom Menace are startling... 1. Slave Boy breaks free of captivity to escape to other worlds.
2. Meets bearded, long haired mentor who teaches him subtle streetwise arts.
3. Meets life long friend in moment of distress.
4. Evil overlord dictating things from behind the scenes.
5. Ending twist.The actor playing Han played it for laughs. There were too many wisecracks and not enough scoundrelesque behaviour.Chewbacca was brilliant. Where can you go wrong with him? Oh yes, waste his talents in the two Sequel Trilogy films.I was most looking forward to meeting Lando Calrissian again after he was cruelly cut out from 'The Force Awakens'. Sadly, the younger Lando does nothing for me to match the panache and style 'Empire's' Lando brought to the screen.This Lando is far too flamboyant and, dare I say it, too gay for the role. Lando is a ""smoothie"" after all and should have been portrayed as a chauvinist akin to the early James Bond.The L3 droid was overplayed when used, same joke repeated over and over (oh wait, another Phantom Menace similarity, remember Jar Jar?) and the Falcon just looks stupid with the dagger nose instead of the half eaten cheeseburger we know and love.Yes, there are good points... the slightly off canon development of Han and Chewies friendship was well played and written, the Qi'ra character love interest, and the villain.Overall, as with the Phantom Menace, the build up promised so much, but the film delivered nothing.Make your own minds up, go see it... my second viewing may prove different.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

This is quite literally the worst movie I watched in the last couple of years. They just keep dragging star wars franchise lower and lower. They forced so much stuff, acting is really bad, zero plot twists what so ever. Ending of the movie is like ?!?! why just why, doesn't make any sense.

2075,njamnhummel,Bringing high stakes adventure back to the big screen,10,22 August 2018,"Solo: A Star Wars Story is just what film has needed. It harkens back to the pulp stories of old, that had a strong lead who is confident in himself, and unafraid to save the day. Alden Ehrenreich shines as Han Solo, creating a deep and entertaining character, who not only keeps the presence and personality of an already legendary character, but builds on it, in a way that makes it his own. A phenomenal supporting cast keeps this movie well balanced, incredible twists and turns keep it thrilling, and the ending leaves the viewer sastified, but ready for more. If you love adventure, entertainment, humor, Star Wars, and just great movies in general, then this is a movie you have to see.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
2076,pmatting-772-262424,"Light-hearted, easy breezy, fun adventure movie",9,30 May 2018,"I'm giving this a 9 out of 10 because I frankly liked most things about this movie: 
1. Alden as Solo (I was sold about 15-20 mins into the movie. I mean hell, he looks like Han Solo, he acted like I imagine a younger, more earnest Han Solo would act. 
 It just sort of worked for me)
2. Glover as Lando (I was sold pretty much immediately)
3. The whole Chewbacca/Solo relationship was fun
4. Woody Harrelson, per usual
5. That part where Woody says his thumbs hurt
6. The entire second and third acts
7. The villain was solid
8. They had to juggle this necessary character arc of Solo becoming more pessimistic and jaded by the end of the movie, and yet still a good guy and be fairly excited about what's next. I thought this would be a difficult combo to balance, but they sort of nailed it
9. The grittinessI didn't really like the surprise character that much, but whatever. The first act was a little weird, and overall the dialogue could use some touching up (like most Star Wars movies). But I enjoyed this way more than Rogue One, which took itself waaay too seriously and was unwatchable anytime Tarkin was onscreen (although there's still nothing better than that Vader scene). But hey, whaddya know, you don't have to create the HIGHEST stakes ever to make a good Star Wars movie.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

2079,largeheadedchap,Just an alright non-offensive Star Wars film,7,14 September 2018,"I've been a big fan of Star Wars since childhood. Not a die-hard or a hardcore convention goer, but I appreciate the franchise a lot.The film Solo, didn't get the reception it wanted and managed to be the first film in the franchise to lose money. However, I wouldn't say that's due to the film by any stretch (I'm not saying its a masterpiece, I'm just saying it's a decent watch). I think the main reason for this films box office demise, was due to Disney and how they market films... by over saturating their newly bought franchises, until it becomes a thoughtless and heartless.I gave this film a go, knowing the bad reviews it had received from the petition fanatics etc. I have to say, the film is pretty entertaining and I was overall, happy with the back story they had came up with for Han Solo. Given, he's a beloved character of Star Wars. So I think, no matter what was produced, someone wouldn't be satisfied. Which is why you should just leave these things untouched. Just think on progressing forwards with films and leave the lore to the fans and books (which I've never read, so...).But anyway, in a nutshell. The film is pretty good, the story is safe and maintains interest throughout, the casting is great and really helped me enjoy it more. Of course, everyone is entitled to an opinion. But to give this film a 1/10 and call it garbage or whatever is a little over the top. It's just an easy to watch film. A 6/7 out of 10 is a fair score.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
2080,jyardman,An absolute travesty,1,27 May 2018,"This movie is wrong on so many points I don't know where to begin. First of all, a very poor casting choice in Alden Ehrenreich. Too short, poor acting, doesn't fit the character at all. The script has lots of stupid and illogical elements. Solo is not his name, it's just a name pulled out of the butt of an imperial officer at the spur of the moment, and yet Han choses to carry that name with him for the rest of his life, and even pass down to his son? Really? His blaster is just the first gun ever given to him? 
I actually was excited when this movie was announced but I was expecting a lot more than this pile of garbage. This makes The Phantom Menace look like the Godfather in comparison.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
2081,rockykajimura,"Not great, but way better than Last Jedi",8,26 May 2018,I went into this movie with low expectations but also hoping to enjoy myself. You can't expect anyone to fill Harrison Ford's shoes as Han Solo but this new guy did a pretty solid job. I mean no one would be as good as the original character but why should we expect them to? For what it was this movie was actually pretty great. Lots of cool Star Wars nerd moments for me. Lots more than Last Jedi anyways.. That movie had me rolling my eyes constantly and during Solo I only did that a couple times haha. I would highly recommend this movie to someone who loves Star Wars nostalgia but going in doesn't have super high expectations. The action scenes were well executed and I actually liked the plot and how it showed Han growing up. Go see it Star Wars fans you just might be surprised!,Solo - A Star Wars Story
2082,msgnanam,The best Star Wars Movies all time!,10,3 June 2018,"Most of you are going to revert to the first three, however I felt the story and characters potrayed by phenomenal acting in Solo were done so well that this deserves to be the called the best Star Wars Movies done so far. I believe everything after the first three was just average, Rogue One did a decent job, but the characters I still felt you could not connect too. With Solo, you could connect, the relationships between characters were given time to mature and manifest layers, which made the story enjoyable. I really like the new direction they have got going with Solo, I hope they keep it up and I while I don't usually write reviews, the harsh criticism this one seems to be getting is completely underserved.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

What jades you is that the main people: Han, Chewie, and Lando are not gonna die, and you know that, so emotional involvement doesn't exist. Those that do die you don't give a crap about. It's no one's fault. All actors pull it off well. It's a good movie but you can wait until Netflix. I have no problems with this movie.

If you're looking for another epic battle to destroy a massive star ship, you will be disappointed. But this movie was one of the best acted Star Wars movies yet! I won't go deep into the plot, but I will try and put this into perspective for the people who didn't like it.. there is a new age of people making Star Wars movies, which means the course of events are going to be different then 1977. This movie really sets up a new age of Star Wars films that could lead to something very excited and worth watching. It had a ""Rebels""-like feel with a 1970's vibe! Probably the best space heist movie ever! I would recommend anyone who is a Star Wars fan go see this movie and get caught up with the New Age of Star Wars!

Takes us for the ride. And it's smart and innovative. Also, it's not all coincidences and coincidences. It's strategies and teamwork.The prequel stuff is in there too... iconic prophesizings were cool. And the visuals were impressive... better than the previous movies. Grand yet understated.

2093,joshuahide,Fun Star Wars movie if you have time,7,21 June 2018,"I'll start this off by saying I didn't have extremely high expectations for this film. Between the change of directors and all of the chaos the trailer release underwent in February, I knew the movie would have some flaws. I will say ,however, that the movie did exceed my expectations.The movie starts out pretty slow with little direction. The action scenes are exciting but not especially gripping. I almost stopped paying attention, but what kept me going was knowing that this was about Han Solo, and not some random Star Wars character. The second half of the movie is really where the story gets interesting. The characters figure out what they have to do and the plot becomes clear. One of the best scenes was during the Kessel Run when Han flies the falcon alone for the first time. It's very refreshing to see Han flying the ship with excitement, rather than the tired indifference that takes over in a New Hope. Like I said; the second half is much better, but the last 40 minutes is what makes the movie worth watching. It felt like an Oceans 11 movie with all the twists, few of which I saw coming. The filmmaking is phenomenal here and it really saves the movie. Without the last 40 minutes, the movie deserves a 4/10.If you have time, go see this movie. It's exciting and fairly well made. If you don't have time, don't worry. You aren't missing out on too much.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

Shaping Han into the man we know and love. The supporting cast uplifts Alden into a star roll that he fills well. Although his star power will never match fords we should appreciate that he knocks on the door of potential.

It's an easy argument to say that all of this back story would have been better left to the imagination. Of course that's true. That's why books are always better than films. All that being said, it feels like the vast majority of reviews here are written by trolls who decided to hate the film before they even saw it. Silly characters and cheesy dialogue in a Star Wars film? Shocking! Learn to enjoy a film for what it's worth, everybody. I think it was a fun ride. Nothing will ever be as special as the original 3. We all know that. Rogue One was more widely accepted by SW fans because it was the first major film outside of the main 9 episodes, and it cleanly tied a beloved character into the beginning of a beloved film. You can't reuse that trick in every spinoff. Sure - Disney is going to make a ton of SW films, which by default makes them less special.

I thought they did a perfect job! going into it I had low hopes for anyone being able to take on the role Harrison Ford did such a great job at, but Alden Ehrenreich did not disappoint. I thought he didn't excellent job, and was very personable. Unlike the naysayers, I thought all of the acting was great!

2103,david-ward214,I could watch another Han Solo prequel.,8,31 May 2018,"I found that this prequel brought back the humor that I enjoyed about the original films.From the first few minutes Han is painted as a character who is always in a bad situation and trying to cut a better deal for himself doesn't mind stealing things from bad guys and tries to do the right thing.A prequel is not going to have Harrison Ford in it. These are big shoes to fill, he does a good job as a younger more cocky character so you can buy that he is a younger Han Solo.If you enjoyed watching Han scheme, mess things up and eventually win through you will enjoy this.I felt rogue one although good, went a bit too gritty and felt more like black hawk down than Star Wars. This prequel got the balance right for me.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
2104,alan-bennett1,Incredibly entertaining,9,27 May 2018,"Don't listen to the somewhat bizarre poor reviews on here and just go and see it for yourself. It's a highly enjoyable, fast paced film with brilliant set-pieces, brilliant performances and casting (let's face it, replacing Harrison Ford is an almost impossible feat to accomplish but Alden does a good job and is a great screen presence). There are lots of nods and references to Star Wars culture from previous films as well as the expanded universe. I've used IMDB for ages yet this is my first review as I'm bewildered by the negativity surrounding it. I've left the review spoiler free so you can enjoy all of the surprises for yourself. Disney ruining Star Wars? Not on this evidence. I hope you enjoy it as much as me and my friend did (who's as much of a Star Wars nut as I am!)",Solo - A Star Wars Story

2106,omunib,I actually liked this movie,8,13 September 2018,I know that everyone is pissed about the the last jedi and how disney killed star wars. i agree with all that. but still this is a very like able movie in my opinion. you should watch while completely ignoring all the disney crap thats happening.,Solo - A Star Wars Story
2107,joebnx1,Glad I read all those bad reviews and as always went to see it to form my own opinion.,7,4 July 2018,"All those bad reviews set me up ... expecting the worst I was wonderfully surprised! I enjoyed this one! A good romp! Beat the heck out of SW I, II, III ! I liked it better than The Force Awakens. It moved along well, though I didn't feel the 3D version had anything extra to add however I thought Alden Ehrenreich did a fine job as a cocky young rash Han Solo! I know some disagree but many don't. Oh well, that's just the way things are!",Solo - A Star Wars Story
2108,Brian-Hann,For the true Star Wars fans.,9,29 May 2018,"As a huge Star Wars fan (and reading my other reviews) I approached this movie with trepidation following The last Jedi. Thank god for this movie. It is simply everything that the Last Jedi was not. This is a proper Star Wars movie for the Star Wars fans. So yes the elephant in the room - Han Solo is being played by someone other than Harrison Ford. Alden Ehrenreich is however simply brilliant in portraying the character. Having read the horror stories in advance I was worried - but there is nothing to doubt about his performance. He even has the stance when firing the blaster down to an art. V good. 
Considering the troubled production the movie is very well constructed. All the set pieces are thrilling and exciting. The key moments are all well done - meeting cheque (tick) the Kessel Run (Tick) and the Millenium Falcon. Tick
Emilia Clarke's and Woody Harrelson's characters are both excellent additions to the Star Wars cannon and just like with Rogue One highlight how the the movies can bring us unforgettable characters beyond Skywalker. I give this a 9 out of 10 and not 10-10 as there are some moments that in my guesstimation are down to Howard's direction versus the original directors. Particularly I think around Q'ira. Her Character seems to change direction abruptedly on two occasions. Also the Enfys Nest character is all a bit convenient. But overall Ron Howard has delivered a Star Wars movie that will please true Star Wars fans. And Very much highlights the failures and misdirection of the Last Jedi",Solo - A Star Wars Story
2109,karlascott,"Decent, but not Solo...",7,24 May 2018,"This was a film I didn't think needed to be made, I didn't expect anything from and certainly didn't love. Very generic story that tries to fill in the blanks about Han... but fails to make any real impact. I did end up liking the film as a bit of fun... but the stakes were very low, and no real feeling of risk.Alden tries (and fails big time) in capturing Han, Lucas film said ""we don't want an impersonation"" however they really do need a semblance of that to make people believe this is Han that we see later in Star Wars (A New Hope for those who only know it as such), clearly Alden is trying to impersonate Harrison at some points and there for me was the problem, he could not do that, he hasn't even a passing resemblance to Harrison and sounds not at all like him with line delivery that just felt off. Donald as Lando was pretty good and was a highlight for me as was the actual Han/Chewie connection that has a bit more of a feel of the real deal. Emilia Clarke does nothing for me, I find her very one dimensional in everything she does. Woody did a decent job of trying to be a Han/Lando hybrid.The effects were pretty awesome - as you'd expect- and there are some beautiful shots... things just seemed a bit I don't know, of a let down. I think the Kasden's tried too hard to do justice to a character that didn't need to be made. That said I still came out of the film with a smile and did enjoy it to a degree. There are a few little nods and Easter eggs. I hated the conscription bit though, it's like maaaaan wtf!? It's like they tried to over think things and go ""the fans are gonna love this, it's so meta and cool""The Falcon is cool, n how things go down with that work on a level, but there's a few changes to what we're lead to believe historically that are altered... but Chewie, wow that dude is a bad a**!",Solo - A Star Wars Story

2112,dirk-146-691298,This one was brilliant.....,10,13 June 2018,"I usually do not write reviews, but in case of SOLO in need to make an exception. This is the first SW movie since Return of the Jedi that i really liked from the very first minute.
SOLO is a real cool, classical StarWars-western-heist-movie that entertains from the very first minute till the end. The actors are all much more better chosen that in the other Disney SW movies and Alden Ehrenreich is doing very, very good job as Han (i really can not understand all the hate). 
The Story offers (in my eyes) more that TLJ or TFA or any Marvel-movie because it has a ot of twists and the characters are not just good or bad and so there are some surprises in it.
Music, sound, editing, set design: all on top level and the CGI (train scene) is technically maybe the best i ever saw in an SW move.
For me Ron Howard has saved this movie and brought me back the Star Wars feeling that i had when watching the original trilogy in the 70s/80s..
So do not belive the haters, if you can go the movies and see it on a big screen it is really worth it.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
2113,avex261,Great movie!,9,19 January 2020,Had low expectations from the start but ended up loving the movie. Humor and dialogue is great! Plot was good and definitely twisting. All great qualities that made the movie a personal Star Wars favorite.,Solo - A Star Wars Story
2114,chapman-nathan-98,Han shot first...and other reasons it gets 10 stars,10,27 May 2018,"I know a whole lot of people are giving this movie negative reviews, and I think I understand why. There are a couple of ""problems"" with it. First of all, it doesn't feel like Star Wars. It has it's own attitude, it's own style. Second of all, if you aren't a real, notice-every-detail fan, a lot of things will go way over your head. But guess what people? I've got some news for you. It isn't Star Wars. It's Solo. It's Han Solo. These aren't the Skywalkers, or the Jedi, or the Sith, heck, the force isn't even mentioned anywhere in the movie! But you know what? That's o.k. Because the purpose of the movie was to tell the story of the origins of one of the best and most loved characters in movie history. And you know what? I think it did that perfectly. Every detail in this movie is for fans. The amount of references and cues to other movies and the very character of Han Solo are astounding. The attention to every single little thing was extremely well done. Not only that, but the story-telling on things that we already know about, such as the Kessel Run or Han ""winning"" the falcon, were very creative, and done in a way that was unexpected and yet satisfying. And speaking of those events, the real problem with this movie surfaces. With the way that the character of Han Solo was created in the original trilogy, everyone had their own opinion and vision of how his story should be told. In a very Lord of the Rings style, the film writer had to somehow create a film that would tell a story that everyone thought they knew, everyone had an opinion on, and everyone imagined in a different way. It's impossible to please everyone. It's impossible to please almost everyone. But they did an amazing job, combining creativity and at the same time sticking to the kanon lore. Alden Ehrenreich as Han Solo was very convincing, especially when you just sit back and aren't as nitpicky as possible. All in all, sure, this movie had a hard challenge to put up with. A lot of things could have gone wrong, and a lot of things might have gone wrong. For you. But not for me. For me, this movie was a perfect backstory to Han Solo, showing us how a character we have known for nearly 50 years came to be. And if you haven't seen it, don't get turned off by the bad reviews. Everyone has their own opinion, and the producers can't please everyone. But, if you let it, this movie just might be exactly what you were hoping for. You know...you've just gotta have a good feeling about it.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

Plot isn't perfect but far better than the 3 new saga movies. Plenty of new locations and characters.

The hatred disgorged toward Disney and this film in some of these reviews is beyond any rational understanding. ""Solo"" is an entertaining film, not great but with some great moments.

2117,stevenkuit,Surprisingly good after all!,10,25 May 2018,"Now let's start this off by saying that while I personally enjoyed the Last Jedi, I would be lying if I said the public perception of Disney era Star Wars films hasn't affected my personal opinion about them.
 
After the luke-warm reception of the two Solo trailers and reasing some of the early reviews, I went in expecting the worst. By the time I walked out of the theatre, I had the biggest grin on my face. This movie felt like the Star Wars we've all been waiting for - crazy aliens, interesting new characters, a real good 'feel' of the Empire days and all that while still respecting the source material.After two disappointing saga entries I didn't think I'd say this ever again but after seeing Solo, I'm really excited to see where Disney takes Star Wars in the future. And last but not least, thank you Ron Howard for completely one-upping Rian Johnson and JJ. Please do more!",Solo - A Star Wars Story

Going into the theater, I was only expecting a so-so good of a movie, with lots of flaws throughout the story line. Now after seeing the movie, I cannot see how so many people have not liked it. Solo brings in more animal creatures and better CGI compared to Rogue One. (The other Star Wars Story). Every actor could not have played their roles any better than they did. Donald Glover and Woody Harrleson stole the show, with Paul Bettany a great villan. It covers about 95% of Solo's history (that we had known before the movie) and just a great experience in total.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

2120,jacar-174-584088,Lowered expectations. Pleasantly surprised.,8,4 June 2018,"My son and I saw this movie this past week. Neither of us were expecting anything much. We were pleasantly surprised at how good this movie was. The story moved at a decent clip but was never felt like it was trying to do too much. The acting was good. Woody Harrelson especially do a great job with his part. There were some unexpected twists and turns in the plot though all of them, for the most part made sense. In fact, the whole movie flowed fine.There were no meaningless side adventures. The movie stayed on track the whole 2 hours+. The cinematic were also quite good and for this the movie is worthy of seeing on the big screen. Finally, you get plenty of back story on Mr. Solo and much insight into the inner workings of the Empire. The only part I did not like came at the end of the movie.*SPOILER*
The big bad turned out to be no other than Darth Maul. Yep. The guy who was separated from his lower torso by Obi Wan Kenobi in episode 1. Honestly, I don't understand the fascination with this character. He is a wooden character that appeared in a hollow movie that was Episode 1. He had all of 2 lines of dialogue in that movie and perhaps doubled that amount in Solo. Jaba the hut would have been a better choice and would have lead to much more tense moments when Han has to dump his cargo. But whatever. I suppose Disney was listening to SW fans when they included him. Solo is a fine movie that captures much of the same vibe as Episode IV. It is perhaps a bit darker but not grim like Rogue 1 (another fine movie!). Disney seems to not know what to do with the original story line. However, with new content that the one-off movies provide, Disney is succeeding beyond my expectations.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

So I waited a bit and as the reviews came in they were disappointing. It seemed like it had very mixed reviews. Some thought it was horrible, some thought it was great, and some people had mixed feelings. So I saw the movie for myself, and as I've said, I really had a great time.

2127,danyb-99,An anonymous and boring trip inside the past of a well-known character,5,26 May 2018,"Probably this is the worst Star Wars movie of the Force Awakens era, the worst spin-off for sure. Rogue One told the unknown story of the crew that managed to stole the plans of the Death Star, while Solo tells the story of a character we saw in four different movies, so it's useless. In 2h 15 min the film manages to be both boring and too fast-paced, the characters are flat as a tablet, the cinematography is monochromatic. The only good things are Lando (Donald Glover is excellent, i want a movie based on his character), and the Kessel Run scene, which reminded me of Mad Max Fury Road. The rest is so anonymous that i don't even remember it.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
2128,lastjosh,For anyone who feels discouraged by the reviews,9,31 May 2018,"For anyone who feels discouraged by the reviews, I tell you this: They're not complaining about the movie, they're complaining because they feel abused by a continous stream of movies from a beloved franchise. It seems ironic, I know, but having nothing for so long and suddenly watching different posters every six months, has to be confusing and bound to raise some eyebrows. 
However, we have to look at it as objectively and simple as possible: If you love movies, you want to watch as many movies as you can. And if you love Star Wars, you love to experience the Star Wars' story! So all of this backlash for having so much of the thing you love is simply a tantrum that I hate to see on so many of my fellow Star Wars' fans.This a very well made film that anyone can enjoy. Plot, acting, FX, Photography, Cast, etc. They did a great job with everything. Taking into account the enourmous pressure of making a film from such a historical franchise, I take my hat off for anyone who has the bravery to do this.So, go and watch it, not with skepticisim, but with that natural feeling of curiousity and love you have every time you sit at the movie theater. I promise, you'll be pleased.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
2129,jamesdochers,"Wait, this is a Star Wars Movie?",3,16 September 2018,"Throughout watching this film, I had to be reminded that what I was watching is in fact apart of the Star Wars franchise. 90% of the time, key scenes, characters or sometimes vehicles (such as the Falcon) had to remind me that this was in fact Star Wars, which didn't help when it came to making the film fit into the franchise. The Soundtrack in some key scenes was muted or of a low volume to the rest of the scene which is the very opposite of what the other Star Wars films do, a big part of Star Wars is the amazing soundtrack that heightens emotions within key scenes; it did however pick up towards the end. For some reason when watching this film, I thought that it could relate more to what a first time Star Wars fan would make if he/she was given a big enough budget, a lot of the scenes were rushed and very choppy when transitioning from camera to camera, it seems like they cut a lot of dialogue, re-shot scenes or cut them entirely. The transitions from one part to the next were not in a Star Wars fashion, normally you would have the 'twirl' into next scene transition or the fade to black etc. But within Solo the transitions were very rough and confusing making you tell yourself ""Oh, this is the next scene now."" I get that this film is trying to be different, I like that Disney are taking Star Wars to a whole new level with these types of films (Rogue one, Solo etc.) but when it is done wrong or the fact that they didn't do extensive research to find the best actor for Han, that is when I lose faith in the Star Wars name, Disney at this point are sucking money from it, killing it. Within the Disney era of Star Wars there has been only one film I have truly enjoyed and re-watched more than twice and that was Rogue One, of course it can be improved, every film can, but it was good. That was the film I thought most related to the Star Wars franchise. 
The cast of the film were not fleshed out enough for me to really give a care about them in all honesty, Chewbacca gets a pass as his lines are just ""AARRGH"" and where can you find a fault in that? But Emilia Clarke's character 'Qi'ra', I thought that she had very little input into the plot, so much so that her character didn't even need to exist, the plot would have remained the same. Which is really sad to see as Emilia Clarke is a good actress and it goes to show how lazy the writing at Disney really is. Disney specialise in cartoons for children, they should really stick to this; by buying and in my opinion tarnishing the Star Wars name t goes to show that a multi-billion-dollar company really doesn't care about its fans, they are just another corporate spanner in the works of true fan entertainment. Another character that I found very irritating and useless was L3, I get that Disney wants to introduce new characters into the franchise but a character as ""important"" as her must have been referenced somewhere else in the lore, which she is not. I also like that Star Wars is trying to relate issues such as 'freedom of enslaved robots' to outside world issues today but not to the point where it is forced into the lines, for example:
Lando: ""You need anything""
L3: ""Equal rights"" 
-This makes no sense, why would a ""free-thinking"" robot just blurt this out without context and to her partner Lando who I assume has been with this robot for a very long time as he mourns her death when it comes. Within Star Wars if a robot is not made for a specific purpose or bought for a purpose then it must be a free robot, this is why you see robots walking FREELY around in other Star Wars films. If Disney also state that L3 spearheaded robot freedom or something like this I will feel let down as L3 died mid-battle on some hidden planet in the middle of a treacherous place of death. The only way people would know if somehow Lando, Han, Chewbacca or Qi-ra told anybody which again I think is very far-fetched. Donald Glover or Childish Gambino as Lando was a really good choice, it is actually one of the casting moves that I agreed with in this film, in some scenes in my opinion Donald sounds exactly like Billy Dee Williams. However, Disney deciding to make Lando pansexual or some crap because he likes a robot is totally out of the picture. A relationship with a robot in Star Wars I think is fine, I am sure there is some places in the Galaxy that are not exactly PG and there are robots involved. But when Disney take a huge steaming turd on a character all together an make him pansexual just to appeal to transgender, confused teens, pansexual or those types of audiences is absolute nonce sense, yes you want to appeal to as many audiences as possible and seem diverse to get money but when they ruin a characters backstory because he wanted to have sex with a robot is a little questionable and out of no-where. It was the same feeling I had with the L3 character, the only reason she was in the film, and she was only there for like twenty minutes, was so Dinsey could be ""diverse"" and appeal to problems in the world today such as slavery (sweat shops) or movements such as black-lives matter but when the character is there solely for this purpose and is not backed up by anything, this is when I start to hate what Disney are doing the franchise. 
A lot of the characters were not needed and died within ten, fifteen minutes of their introductions which I thought was a little dark for Star Wars. A lot of the scenes towards the beginning of this film had a lot of dark or serious overtones for example Han escaping his world because of gangsters and crime syndicates or the training scene in which you see dead recruits laying everywhere, I thought I was watching a futuristic re-make of Saving Private Ryan when watching that scene, it wasn't very Star Wars like which is why I do not like this film personally. 
The Kessel run scene with the gravity well was pretty intense and was my favourite scene out of the entire two and a half hours of it's run time. It was intense, action-packed and very well shot in my opinion, the best scene in the film. As a huge fan of Star Wars, I often love the full movies, the original trilogy is an example and Rogue One. Out of the rest I only enjoy key scenes, the Kessel run was the only scene in this entire film I really liked. Although it is adrenaline pumping tension in that film the sense of danger is numbed by the reasoning in the back your head that, Han, Lando and Chewie are key characters and are in future films so they can't die, which was a let-down. That is one of the reasons you shouldn't make a prequel with key characters.
The build up towards the final conflict at the end was a big let-down, the twist in which Han actually brought the fuel on the Crimson Dawn ship was a little predictable. It was also very confusing as to why Erin Kellyman's character, Enfys, just gives up fighting Woody Harrelson, Beckett; it would have made more sense if they were both good guys that Enfys would just contact Beckett and say they are on the same team, but no Disney had to drag out an entire confusing plot for money. Another stunt that they pulled for money in my opinion was the Maul cameo, there was literally no reason for him to be in this movie and explains nothing. It is also very confusing as to why Qi ra turns bad again at the very end and follows Darth Maul's instructions. The ""might"" of the empire was also very muted within this film which I did not like at all, the only background we have about them is that they are undergoing taking control of the galaxy, need troops this is why Han joins and the tie fighter scene before the Kessel run. Again, very lazy writing especially for something as big and iconic as Star Wars, the fact that Han states ""I'm going to be the best pilot in the Galaxy"" then there is a three year time skip to when he is apparently kicked out of the academy and sent into the ground infantry just shows how much Disney likes to write these movies (Sarcasm). 
The way that Han also gets his blaster, meets chewie, acquires the falcon and even gets his name was lazy writing, maybe the falcon gets a pass because it is referenced in the previous Star Wars films that he won it in a card game. I love how easily Lando forgets about L3 at the end also like she never existed and just gives his ship to Han when he wins it. In my opinion this was lazy writing. I truly think that if Disney took a little more time, had some fans review the script in secret, and took in what the fans think about the previous films, Force Awakens, Last Jedi and Rogue One this film could have been so much more. Alden Ehrenreich as Han wasn't entirely a bad mistake, he did have a good charm to his character and his lines were pretty good but other than the very few exceptions I think Disney should have done some deeper digging for a person to fill such an iconic role of the scruffy-looking nerf herder! At times I thought to myself that Han wouldn't do that or this isn't what Han would say. Now I'm not saying I am an expert on Han Solo but I am saying is that as a big fan of Star Wars is that fans like myself can tell or predict what a Solo movie should or could be about. To conclude, the highlights of this movie for me were the following:-Donald Glover as Lando-The Kessel Run -ChewbaccaOther than these the film for me was a let-down and I really thought that Disney would have taken on board the reviews from the Force Awakens and the Last Jedi to make this a great film, this is why I give it a 3/10 and in my opinion is one of the worst Star Wars films in the franchise (Other than the prequel trilogy).Thanks for reading!",Solo - A Star Wars Story
2130,doron1973,Lucasfilm should better do some home work! Nice movie that no one really needed.,6,23 May 2018,"I saw the film yesterday and it was the first Star Wars film ever I left without having any emotions about it.
It didnt change the way I see Han Solo or Chewie now.
It was klunky at times and items were forcefully added just so there will be a lightsaber etc. in the movie.
It felt like a live action movie of Rebels but with far less depth to the story.
The film was enjoyable as a movie but has nothing to do with what STAR WARS fans are expecting to come out of this franchise in my opinion.
I hate to say it but this one ranks for me the lowest in all of STAR WARS live action movies. Yes even below Attack Of The Clones and Phantom Menace.
Normally I can´t wait to get back t see a Star Wars movie a second time. This time I gave away my tickets for next visit I was planning.Lucasfilm should start thinking seriously about delivering stuff that Star Wars fans are looking to get. Otherwise not just the common audience but also hardcore SW fans will lose interest to some degree.
From the new movies that came out under the Kathleen Kennedy era my ranking is as following:1.Rogue One
2. The Last Jedi
3.The Force Awakens
4. Solo",Solo - A Star Wars Story

2132,raymond-boze,Attrocious,1,30 August 2018,BORING!!! Nothing about this movie managed to hold my attention for much more than 5-10 seconds at a time. There comes a time when filmmakers need to leave well enough alone and the Star Wars saga is past that point and all this movie did was solidify that point. Go spend your money on a bottle of unisom or other sleep aid. It'll be cheaper.,Solo - A Star Wars Story
2133,jeffkemperman,Don't let the haters keep you away!,10,25 May 2018,"Solo is incredibly well done and has a lot more to it than the haters would have you believe. The homage paid to the original trilogy/characters is subtle and powerful if you pay attention. The amount of time Ehrenreich and Glover clearly spent studying Ford and Williams is incredibly impressive...down to even very nuanced mannerisms. The story is very well done and I will definitely be seeing it again! **On a side note, it makes me sad to see all of these negative reviews. I certainly get that people have different tastes, expectations, etc., but to walk out of a great Star Wars universe story like Solo and be so incredibly disappointed and in some cases angry, really just leaves me sad. Go in with a smile and watch beloved characters on the screen in a new way....I promise you, it's worth it.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

2138,gurrakramer,"Overall, a great movie - if you overlook its 'flaws'",6,4 June 2018,"For transparency's sake, I went into this movie hesitantly suspecting more of what the latest films in the franchise has gotten criticised for. However, I didn't want my hard earned money and evening at the movies being spoilt by the current ""culture war"", if you will, so I wilfully tried to overlook whatever social commentary that might be coming my way.With that said, what I wanted was a fun adventure film, with a modicum of references to the other movies, that explored the early days of the relationship of our favourite scoundrel and his walking carpet/partner in crime. And that is what I got. The action scenes and set pieces were intense and enjoyable but unfortunately maybe not as memorable as one would hope. I did however particularly enjoy the short war-sequence in which Han first meets the crew (which consisted of rather uninteresting characters, except Beckett) as it was perhaps the darkest and dirtiest in any of the films in the franchise, albeit cut a bit short by the fantastic introduction of Chewie. Which, surprisingly, brings me to the flaws of the movie.Han and Chewie's escape is contrasted by the rather blunt imagery of the ""rebellion"" on Kessel with Lando's robot L3, a Soviet commissar in disguise, breaking the chains of the oppressed in a cinematic wet dream of a revolutionary adolescent communist. With the only substantive message being equality for all, I guess the main takeaway from this, with the modern social debate as context, is that corporations are evil by design and the robots in the Star Wars universe represent the trans-community. Incidentally, as L3 later on becomes a part of the Millennium Falcon (or should I say ""Millennial Falcon?"" Although, the falcon is an imperialist symbol so I don't know the validity of that claim), more importantly its navigation system, the *debated name* Falcon we all know and love subsequently becomes a space ship literally driven by the morals of a communist robot. Parts of the film, especially the ending, is seasoned with a large dash of post-colonial theory, perhaps more so than the preceding sequel and anthology film(s). I might be grasping at straws. It seems I failed in not bothering with what I just mentioned. Well, with a bit of will power, the movie is genuinely enjoyable with a balanced amount of fun as well as dark themes. 7/10 would maybe recommend.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
2139,dee-travis,Solo Defies the Odds,9,26 May 2018,"The haters are obviously just trolling at this point, because Solo is tons of fun! Acting is on point (I was an Alden Ehrenreich naysayer, but he proved me wrong), characters are great; everything with Han, Chewie, and Lando is fantastic, and it's just a great time in the galaxy far, far away. The story's nothing special, but safe fan-service was a smart movie after TLJ. Well done, Disney; you snatched a victory from the jaws of defeat with this one.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

But this is amazing. I love all the actors and actresses (also Chewbacca !!).
Han solo (Alden) has his charm like Harrison Ford, not quite same but he's good one, and the others also got very great looks in this film.
The CG was terrific and I feel the reality on Millenium Falcon like always, love this ship so much !!!
I also feel wonderful and enjoy the adventure of Han Solo and his nice friend, and this episode you will know why Han Solo is being Han Solo for Luke, For Leia, For the Rebellion.

The leads in this movie did a great job especially Glover, he really brought the spirit of lando to the movie and Ehrenreich Took on a big part and did really well playing a younger Han with all his manurisims down couple that with solid writing and diolpuge and you got some good characters, and Harrilson did great with his role too. After that there are a lot of good nods to the cannon and it kept true to a lot of the origin stories you love that got retconned. It really was a fun movie and did a great job and getting to the roots of the characters and how they lead into episode 4 and beyond. Great movie that's 100% worth watching",Solo - A Star Wars Story
2145,jeff-00671,Very pleasantly surprised,8,25 May 2018,"SPOILER: I heard they were making this movie and thought it sounded completely unnecessary. With all the behind the scenes drama, I thought it sounded like a debacle. Then the trailers hit and I started to feel a bit better about it. Then actually seeing it, I was surprised how much I actually enjoyed myself. I didn't always buy Alden Ehrenreich as Han Solo, but when I did I really did. Donald Glover did a great young Billy Dee Williams. Some of the Easter eggs were great, and I can't wait to see it again to try and pick out more. 
*A note about some of the one and two star ratings- It's obvious that some of the butthurt fanboys who have decided to boycott the movie because a woman is in charge, or there's a GIRL in the lead or whatever such nonsense have not seen the movie but have decided to write NON-SPECIFIC reviews of the Kennedy era Star Wars movies to try and drive down the star ratings. Guys, seriously. Grow up. If you hate some else's art, make your own. ""It's not my Star Wars"" is not valid criticism, edgelords.Oh and to prove I have seen the movie, there's a freakin' DARTH MAUL CAMEO!",Solo - A Star Wars Story
2146,ashlee_bilic,Perfectly told,9,27 May 2018,"One of my favourite Star Wars movies so far. This story explains where Han comes from which in my opinion was a mystery, everyone knows all the other characters origin stories. However Han came out of nowhere he didn't have anything to do with the dark side or the force he was brought into it by Luke and Leia, nobody knew his story before that and it needed to be told. It makes sense that there was nothing to do with anything brought up in previous Star Wars movies because Han Solo didn't come from that, this movie told his story perfectly and I'm ready for a sequel for my unsanswered questions.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

Unlike The Force Awakens, this movie lacks the charm that came from seeing this world in another adventure. Ron Howard (Director) and the rest of the cast (except for Woody Harrelson and Donald Glover) and crew bring nothing new to the table, lore and all. While there is some positives, like a fun heist and chase scene or two, a couple of good performances, and some interesting locations, Solo is bland in its presentation and full of the tiring adventure heist movie cliches people have come to expect.

2149,niallmacmillan-70192,"Solo - Entertaining, Good fun and better then Last Jedi",9,10 June 2018,"This was a fun film that captured the Han Solo character perfectly. Explained the origin and had all the tongue in cheek humour you could expect from Han Solo and Chewie. Only thing that felt out of place was Emily Clarke. Just pretty much the same character from GOT. I couldn't disassociate her from it. The actor they got to play Han was spot on. Great showing for him and would love to see another Solo movie in the future.Ignore all these 1 stars, it is really ridiculous how sensitive these hardcore fans can be!

Yes, there is the loss of excitement in the fact that you know Han and Chewie live, but that doesn't take away the adventure they go through. The new characters are actually interesting and lead into something new and certain twists are brought up that make this more of a lead in than just a single movie.

As I bought the ticket I was thinking I was going to regret this. Now I've seen it a few times and the only thing I regret is all the trash I talked about it. It's a great film and the actor portraying Solo does an amazing job. No, he doesn't have what Harrison Ford had, but Harrison Ford is not exactly young anymore. They did the best with what they had. I don't see anyone else who could have played the role better. And the film has a great plot and tells a great story of two best friends (Han and Chewy) and how they met. It also has some great twists and a great Cameo.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

Solo, isn't a Star Wars film, it's just set in the Star Wars Universe. 
Han Solo isn't a Jedi so not having that and the Force element is going to be what fans of the franchise are going to miss.

After the terrible new trilogy movies (TFA and TLJ), and a barely ok Rogue One, my expectations were at the lowest ever. I sat down in the cinema with some serious prejudice - having decided it was going to be bad, and having told all my friends what I expected.To my great surprise, as I started watching the movie, I couldn't believe how great it was! And it was getting better and better as the story developed.
Solo has the original Star Wars spirit, plus even something extra. The story is often unpredictable and the characters have depth and complexity.Additionally, I was very skeptical about anyone else playing Han Solo other than Harrison Ford, I completely refused to believe anyone could do it.
However, Alden Ehrenreich achieved the impossible!By the end of the film it was obvious to me I was wrong on all accounts.
I must admint I've never been so glad to admit my mistake to everyone :)",Solo - A Star Wars Story
2159,coldeb,Solo is an excellent underrated Star Wars film,10,3 June 2018,"I just came back from watching Solo at the movies it was an absolute blast don't be put off by negative reviews of Solo i had some doubts because of the trailers myself but the film is far better than the trailers depict.I think of the recent Star Wars films of the Disney era this is behind Rogue One but above TFA & TLJ. I went in to Solo with mixed expectations but i came out very satisfied with the movie. Political Correctness is not here this time, the humour isn't forced it's just right this time, it's got a lot of Action, has great Special Effects,the acting is fine in my opinion. The casting of Young Solo is good in my opinion although Harrison Ford is still better,The rest of the cast do a good job.
The film is between 12-9 years before A New Hope and basically tells you Han Solo's origin story and how he meets familiar characters there's some surprises and Easter eggs the fans will recognise. It's also great to have different antagonists for a change i hope they do direct follow up's to this film it clearly has a few things unresolved at the end. i will rank the other films from best to least favourite 1 Rogue one 10 out of 10, 2 SW EP3 ROTS 10 out of 10,3 SW EP5 TESB 10 out of 10, 4 SW EP6 ROTJ, 5 SW EP4 ANH 10 out of 10, 6 Solo 10 out of 10, 7 SW EP2 AOTC 10 out of 10, 8 SW EP1 TPM 10 out of 10,9 SW TFA 10 out of 10, 10 SW TCW Movie 10 out of 10,11 Ewoks The Battle for Endor 9 out of 10,12 SW TLJ 8 out of 10,13 Caravan Of Courage 6 out of 10.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

But in SOLO, Han joins the Empire, which made me think SOLO came after Episode III. Because they mentioned The Emperor and they had the Stormtroopers. But at the end Darth Maul makes an appearance, which threw me off! Darth Maul was killed in Episode I. He was not around during the start of the Empire! It should have been Darth Vader, not Maul!

However this surprised me a lot. Alden Ehrenreich was the biggest surprise for me because I did not see anyone playing Han Solo but Harrison Ford however Alden done a fantastic job and was very likeable. The only thing I would say in regards to this is that he was not very grumpy or serious in comparison to Harrison Ford's Solo but it still works a lot and there is still time for him to change, so it can be looked past for
me. A negative for me was the Droid as it was used to make jokes and they were not very funny and were almost cringy and it almost felt like it was used to push an agenda but you can look past that easily. Donald Glover played Lando very well as well and it feels like an authentic portrayal of him.

The story wasn't the best, but it kept me interested. I thought the action was good too. Overall, I truly enjoyed it. If Alden could act a little better, I think I had given it a higher score.

I liked Alden's take on Han, and didnt find myself comparing him to Harrison Ford, and loved seeing the dynamic between him and Chewie. Obviously Donald Glover was amazing. The humor was on point and not overused or campy like in TLJ, and the sassy droid was well written and witty. I've seen some complaints about getting tired of these droids in the past couple movies but I just don't understand that either.The only real criticism was maybe a pacing issue, but I will have to re-watch it a couple times because it may not actually be the problem. I might attribute the pacing problem to actually be due to the horribly uncomfortable movie theater seats I went to, so I was in pain about halfway through.Just go see it, its a solid entry into the Star Wars Universe.

This movie has the same issues as the prequels in that not everything needs an origin. Han also feels like he is just along for the ride at times and he is too good of a guy. He suffers from being too much of a Mary Sue just like Ray was criticized for being in the Force Awakens. The difference is that this movie is suppose to show us why he does the things he does.

Alden Ehrenreich does a fantastic job of portraying a young Han Solo as does Donald Glover as a young Lando.
Go into this movie with no expectations and enjoy the ride. It comes close to the fun and excitement you experienced when seeing the original Star Wars movie along with some of the drama and suspense of Empire. But this film stands alone and if you've never seen a Star Wars movie than that's okay. 
The stand alone films (the other being Rogue One) appear to big the stronger releases by Disney with developed characters and thoughful plots. There's no sideline stories visiting a casino planet to release space horses here. This film carefully puts all the pieces in play for an enjoyable experience.
The dialogue is witty and reminiscent of the original trilogy and plenty of 'Easter Eggs' for eager eyed fans.
I could not help smiling throughout the film and felt like a kid again visiting the Star Wars universe for the first time. And this is what Star Wars should be. An escapist adventure focusing on a diverse group of characters in the most amazing of environments overcoming what seem to be insurmountable odds. Sure we know the heroes survive; we've been on that journey before with the prequel trilogy. But unlike them, this is truly the first time since Return of the Jedi that I have felt like I was back in that galaxy far far away.
It was never going to be easy to tap into the famous character Harrison Ford made so iconic, but once you put that scepticism aside and accept this younger version, you'll have a great time.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
2196,tubbyninja,"Easter eggs and nostalgia, in a new and exciting way.",9,25 May 2018,"SPOILER: Don't get me wrong, I fully understand that Disney is hell bent on the consumer throwing cash their way, and that to the big corporate guys at the top they only care about money, but I think Ron Howard and his cast have done an amazing job with the second stand alone Star Wars movie! I think the writing as a whole was great, and although I wasn't a fan of L3-37 for her over use of feminism and 'POWER TO THE (robot)PEOPLE' I can see how she could be loved, and I'm someone who didn't warm to K2-SO straight away but now have him down as my favourite droid in the franchise, so given a few more watches I may see some more redeeming factors. But characters like Han and Qi'ra had great lines and enjoy the interaction as a whole. 
Beckett I believe needed more backstory as to who he is and why, I feel like he was a strong character and the ending scenes really help to shape Han into who he is in episode 4, but you never really understand why he's there pretending to be an imperial soldier at the start, bar to steal a ship (which they could've got from anywhere). 
The one thing from the writing I felt lacklustre was the connection between Han and Lando, I can recall only a handful of scenes where they say more than 2 words together yet are in the same ship from a third of the way through the film onward. But saying that I feel Donald Glover is an amazing fit for this role, he's swauve, quirky and eccentric, and really brings to life the early stages of Lando. Yet I cannot see yet why Lando would go out of his way to save Han on Tattoine given the ending of their relationship in this movie. Maybe Solo 2 (if it were to be made) would explore their relationship more and show how Lando gets to Bespin. I also loved seeing the beggining of the Empire and how it conquered different planets. it was a different side to the empire, seeing the struggle to become the EMPIRE as we see it in IV, and seeing the planet of Corellia after all this time was so great. Now the Easter eggs, there were so many! I am most disappointed by the fact there was no mention of Boba Fett or Mandalorians even hinting to a cameo from Boba but hey, there's still time! But we did get a reference to another Hunter in that group, Bossk! One of Beckett's perished troupe mentioned his name as they were listing who they'd rather have over Han on the snow planet. The dice also came into play a lot more than I expected, and I found the imperial March advertisement in the security check scene both silly and amusing. But possibly the most crazy and amazing Easter egg in the whole film comes right at the end, after the final fight between Han, Qi'ra and Vos, Han leaves to chase down Beckett and Chewie, leaving Qi'ra to contact Vos' boss, for it to be the one and only... DARTH MAUL! I was sat in the cinema at about 2am jumping up and down in my seat the second I saw his face. It was crazy seeing finally some reference back to the prequels! And this all but confirms a Darth Maul spin-off, which hopefully would see a continuation of Qi'ra's story, and better yet if a Darth Maul story is in the works, SURELY that suggests a Kensobi film is coming in the near future! After seeing this film I am super stoked and excited for the next Star Wars story, I think these films are just the beggining and after episode 9 I believe the franchise will really open it's wings and fly!",Solo - A Star Wars Story

The only thing I would say is that it left me wanting more, I want to know whats next for Han. I just hope they'res more from Alden Ehrenreich and Emilia Clarke, especially after the cliffhanger.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
2198,stefanovismara,Never tell him the odds,8,24 May 2018,"Just saw Solo: A Star Wars Story. I begin with saing that this film was not a cinematic event , unlike The Force Awakens, that reprised the SW saga were it was left, or Rogue One, the first SW spin-off. So for Solo:ASWS there wasn't so much hype; and I think that this fact made me like the film even more. I didn't go to the cinema with high expectations, and I was really really surprised by the final product (also considering all the problems that this film had during its production, the result could have been reeeeally worse). 
Solo is not a story about Jedi Masters, extremely powerful Sith Lords, it's not even a story about the Force; it's the story of a bunch of humans, that go for an adventure all across the galaxy. The action scenes are really well directed (thanks to Ron Howard, that avoided the complete disaster this film could have been), and the soundtrack really helps to build a certain atmosphere during the film. So, in the end, go to see this film by yourselves, and then judge it. I didn't have high expectations, but I got pleasantly surprised: this film is fun, entertaining, and also contains a couple of surprises that I didn't expect at all. 
The film's not perfect, it obviously has some flaws (like some things that happen too fast, or some characters that could have been explored more) but overall I really got satisfied. Oh and Alden Ehrenreich is really believable as the legendary Han Solo: he creates his own version, without necessary imitating the great Harrison Ford, but still preserving the spirit of our favorite smuggler. Also, Donald Glover performance as Lando Calrissian is one of the best things this film has to offer. Thanks for reading this and... enjoy the film!",Solo - A Star Wars Story

Any way that means darth maul would of Ben dead at this time it would of been realistic if it was darth Vadar because he already had Ben turned by the dark side by emperor palpatine and that means darth maul would be long gone that means he wouldn't of Been able to contact darth maul in the end of the movie what I just typed is one reason this movie is all over the place in the Star Wars trilogy.

Not reallyas good as the originals, but much better than episodes 1-3. Too many people have insane expectations and relate everything to the originals. Just enjoy the film for what it is. I thought Donald Glover was a great Lando, and Alden Ehrenreich was a cool Han. Were they Billy Dee Williams and Harrison Ford? Of course not, and you shouldn't expect them to be.

Beginning with the characters I have to say that Han wasn't Han Solo. BUT the thing is I believe that he could become him. They did a really really good job with the relationship between Chewie and Han. The dialogs were on point between them. That's exactly what I wanted to see. 
Furthermore I liked the outcome of this. I thought that the whole story is predictable to some point. Well. It was. Sort of. But I did a really good job on making it interesting and it's opening a real and promising part of the Star Wars Universe. I enjoyed the ending with Qi'ra aswell. I really wanna know where she's is going and what place she will take. What I don't get is that many of this Star Wars fans giving a shit about new characters! But Star Wars is the story of episode 1-6 (4-6). But these are stories in the Star Wars universe which can be enjoyed but only if you are open to them. If everything what's new is instantly bad. Why even watching. Please.. don't ruin this for people.BTW. Of course Disney is making many movies to earn more money.

I payed about 15 Euro for my ticket. But I got that back in fun, excitement and feels. As long as that happens I'm fine with that because the universe is big and there are many stories to be told.Thanks for reading.

2214,dmurf-41458,Cynic vs. Fanboy: Solo,7,1 June 2018,"Solo: A Star Wars StoryThe optimist in me would like to say that Solo: A Star Wars Story is a massive leap for the Star Wars universe, but it'd be lying. The cynic in me would like to say that Solo is a drastic regression for the Star Wars universe, but that would be lying too. I'd compare Solo to picking the Warriors to win the NBA Finals this year, a safe bet. It takes almost no risks (except for Lando sleeping with his robot), which mosts Star Wars films often take. It's lack of risks translates into a predictable adventure. But it's also really really fun. So I'll let my cynical and optimistic personalities war it out, and we'll see who comes out on top.The Cynic:This movie is as bland as bland can be. There's no huge climaxes or epic failures for its characters. It's technically just a linear story about a crazy guy's adventures through space. Now some would say that that's a good thing, but you can't review a Star Wars movie by itself, so I'm comparing it to other films in the universe. Star Wars is a space opera on a massive scale, smaller stories like this one should be relegated to the small screen. This movie lacks the epicness of its predecessors, the same epicness that made them so captivating. If I wanted to watch a movie franchise where the scrappy hero, goes on adventures and gets betrayed a bunch, I'd watch Indiana Jones or something. I want high stakes and wide ranging conflict in my Star Wars movies, not drawn out adventure and fan service. There are actually 
long poker games in this movie! Poker games! In a Star Wars movie! While the performances were admirable, none of them really hit home. Not even the effects can save it, 4 out of 10.The Optimist (in this case fanboy): THE SIGNATURE DICE! HAN SOLO GETTING HIS LAST NAME! HAN MEETING CHEWIE! HAN FINDING CHEWIE A NICKNAME! HAN WITH HIS SIGNATURE JACKET ON! HAN FRIGGIN SHOWERING WITH CHEWIE! HAN GETTING HIS SIGNATURE BLASTER! LANDO CALRISSIAN! THE MILLENIUM FALCON! HAN SOLO FLYING THE FALCON FOR THE FIRST TIME! THE KESSEL RUN! HAN AND CHEWIE FLYING TOGETHER FOR THE FIRST TIME! WAIT A SECOND, DARTH MAUL?!?!?!?! DARTH FRIGGIN MAUL!!!!! OH AND HAN WINNING THE FALCON FAIR AND SQUARE! AGGHHHHHHH 10 OUT OF 10!Final Verdict:Alright guys you've had your fun but I need to form a final opinion here. Solo is a fluid character driven story, one we often don't see in Star Wars movies. It takes the massive universe and focuses on one small story. This can obviously be a turn off for some fans, as it was for me during the first 45 minutes. Those first 45 are slow and it takes awhile for the movie to gain steam, but everything after that was pure unadulterated fun. It delivered on everything it promised to. Seeing Han go through the experiences mentioned in the original trilogy was amazing. Alden Ehrenreich is shockingly great as Harrison Ford's iconic character. His charm allows the character to flourish in a solo movie (see what i did there). Donald Glover does an okay job as Lando, but his performance felt forced and wasn't as natural as Ehrenreich's. Woody Harrelson is Woody Harrelson, not much to say there. My favorite performance, however, was Emilia Clarke as Qui'ra. This woman needs more and more roles that capitalize on her goofy charm. She is composed and serious when she needs to be, but also funny and captivating when she doesn't. Long story short I'd like to marry her. The new Star Wars films have many flaws, but one thing they've got going for them is the cinematography. Boy is it amazing in this one. The universe is brought to life with so many cool shots and exciting landscapes, and the establishing shots of planets are flat out beautiful. While this movie is complete fan service, I lapped up every moment of it. Overall it is a fun ride that makes you fall in love with these characters all over again, 7 out of 10.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

Thanks Disney for bringing these things to life! I really enjoyed the movie and have already started wondering about other story arcs from this one. My rating of 10 might be a little high but I think it's justified to offset all the haters that score it a 1.

2216,ethanabarton,Can't complain; Star Wars has yet to disappoint me.,8,27 May 2018,"Any non Star-Wars-fanatic would look at this in disgust as another quick-made product for the pile, which is understandable; but even so, Solo: A Star Wars Story pulls off the high level of quality that is only to be expected of the iconic franchise. Simply put, it's still absolutely worth seeing.Reproducing one of the most recognizable characters in film history is of course a dangerous risk, and by no means does Alden Ehrenreich do it perfectly; but you have to give him legitimate credit, he does it quite well. Even his standing pose; his facial expression during flirtations; his gun-slinging stance are expertly perfected to match those from 40 years ago. The same can be said for Donald Glover, whose acting job appropriately gives us the gist of a character we previously knew little about. It was rather disappointing to not see any lightsaber activity (besides one practically irrelevant sight), but the existing fight scenes-particularly the one that ultimately killed Dryden Vos-were well choreographed and still very ""cool."" Nevertheless, the continual nature of this high-intensity action sort of dulled the viewers to it and made each scene less relatively riveting. But if you could keep yourself immersed, it was very visually satisfying, though exhausting.The variety of new characters was well-done; none of them seemed extraneous or excessive, and each played a significant role in the plot or in Han's life. On top of that, the development of supporting characters-such as Beckett, Qi'ra, and Dryden Vos-was strong as well, adding a necessary level of complexity and emotional attachment. Each coming from incredible backgrounds, with noteworthy circumstances; more characters than just Han seem to be begging the viewers to step into their shoes.The plot line was extremely, and perhaps excessively, convoluted. It's a trick as old as time to take a character you thought you trusted and reveal them to be a traitor, or vice versa; but when this is done to the same character 4 or 5 times in one movie, the entertainment factor dwindles. It seemed that Ron Howard was trying to do with Qi'ra what J. K. Rowling did with Severus Snape, only the effect was not quite the same, especially considering the tactic was compressed into practically one hour. And when you throw in the surprises of Beckett and Enfys Nest, it becomes too much.On the one hand, it would be justified to call this movie ""lazy writing,"" as all of the ideas were pre-written ideas (winning the Falcon, the Kessel Run, meeting Chewy, etc.); on the other hand, these events were represented very well. And although it seems weird to decide his whole backstory happened over the course of a couple days, these events were well-integrated into a coherent story that appropriately ties into Han's next story. There were, however, key places that did not tie back in to the main series. Qi'ra's story, as well as her coming to associate with the dark side, was never explained. No one knows why Beckett was going to Tatooine. And it was a bold move to make Darth Maul's survival a canonical fact. Sadly, these mysteries will be left anticlimactically unresolved-a blunder on the writers' part.But what can I say? I was entertained, it was fun to watch, it was a quality movie. A quality that does not ashame the Star Wars franchise, nonetheless. Critics can pull it apart for minor reasons, but it was a good movie that I would go see again.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

2222,giorgosrus,Indeed better than expected.,10,25 May 2018,"I entered the theater with low expectations, mainly because 1 i didn't want to get really dissapointed if the film was mediocre/bad 2 because people started already putting out early reviews digging a hole in the ground for the film already. I am a person who generally knows how to appreciate a good film and ffs this was a good STAR WARS film. It contained a solid plot good visuals subtle humor nostalgic references to characters of the saga and a surprise at the end that left me stoned. 
In conclusion it had very few flaws for me and I have to say that Star Wars fans are the worst fans I ve ever seen. This movie doesnt deserve a 10 that i did put for it but it also doesnt deserve the hate people toss on it for no real reason. Good job and thank you to the crew that made it from me.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
2223,absolutewebdev,Ron Howard FTW,10,25 May 2018,"Firing the directors was the best decision Kathleen Kennedy made. JJ Abrams needs to leave too. Ron Howard definitely pulled off a miracle for Disney. After the ""Last Jedi"" disaster I thought Star Wars was dead. 
Pros:
Cast was great, Story line done well, Effects awesome, Surprise ending, great introduction with proper story telling (Unlike Rogue One). The movie was not overly predictable, relationship building of the characters was stellar, Music was great, Actors stuck the the Character role with less deviation.
Cons:
Alden Ehrenreich looked and sounded more like Denis Quaid than Harrison Ford, Alden Ehrenreich sounds like a west coaster while Harrison Ford is from Chicago and it really hurts the voice articulation, There were 2 music compositions that sounded like two different songs I heard before from other artists (I would need to watch again to pin point them) not really a big deal.In a nutshell, I would say the difference between Ron Howard and the other directors is that Ron Howard has good morals where the other directors I can't really tell if they have any morals. It comes out badly in the story line. Especially when they use odd sexual references in a ""kids"" movie.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

2226,clintile,A solid movie (spoilers),8,26 May 2018,I am a long time Star Wars fan and went into this movie with low expectations and was pleasantly surprised. The action was fun the visuals were stunning and the acting was done very well.

2228,nevefan-18280,Better than expected,8,21 October 2018,"Initially I wasn't very interested in seeing this, there was something about the idea of a Han Solo movie that just didn't spark any excitement in me. As it's the only Star Wars movie I haven't seen I decided to finally give it a go. I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed it. The cinematography was great with a nice blend of dark contrasts rather than using a light pallet. The colour scheme suited the kind of movie it was. The special affects were very good throughout. I enjoyed the new characters and planets involved and thought the story was quiet good. The music was different. Not sure if I liked it or not. Bits of John Williams iconic scores were played in amongst new compositions which I'm not sure I liked. The story covers events where he meets chewbacca, gets the falcon, his gun, meets Lando etc.
Overall I recommend this movie to Star Wars fans and non fans alike. Its very good and well worth a watch.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
2229,sdgreyjedi,Just Like Old Times,9,26 May 2018,"As a of the 1977 original movie, this one fits right into that world. This is the movie the fanboys have been whining they want to see - with the added irony that they are boycotting it. If A New Hope came out today they would pan that as well. They really don't know what they want.This movie hit all the OT beats - enjoyable story, good quips, and lots of action. There was much more action than I was anticipating. There are Easter Eggs galore for those who studied the Expanded Universe novels and games and definitely it is fan service with references to characters from other SW movies, which is not a bad thing. This is a popcorn flick, not a moody set piece like the prequels, and it needs to be enjoyed on that level. Very little CGI and more practical effects for those that dislike green screen. The so-called Social Justice Warrior (SJW) robot is no more annoying than K2 in Rogue One and in my opinion adds to the adventure. C-3PO is an annoyingly whiny piece of metal and people like him, so why make a stink about L3?It's not perfect but it is damn good and, regardless of Lando's sexual orientation which has nothing to do with this story, I highly encourage EVERYONE (including families) to go see this film. If you don't want to waste $15 then see it at a matinee. Don't let ""critics"" tell you what to do, be a rogue like Han and make your own decisions.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

He is from corrilian, his name is han solo (but not how he got his name), he meets chewbacca, and the millennium falcon. And that's it. It is a poorly made Disney knock off of a move that was already written for them. Not to mention if they went with the books they could have made there own trilogy and made more money. With the 4 star wars movies that Disney has made it is obvious that money is there only concern.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
2231,simonr-99154,"Definitely worth watching, although with some minor flaws",7,21 June 2018,"Finally I went to the cinema to see Solo: A Star Wars Story. If you want me to sum up the experience briefly I would say it is definitely worth seeing. There is really a lot of good I can say about this movie. I liked it much more than Rogue One and I would even say that by some means it was nicer to watch than The Last Jedi. However you need to be aware of a few things.First of all, Alden Ehrenreich is not Harrison Ford. And he will never be. And that is absolutely fine! In my opinion, putting a performance that is not trying to mimic Harrison Ford is a good thing, not bad. I cannot understand why there are so many people bashing him. His Han Solo was good in my eyes. If he would try to be Harrison Ford like, he would fail hard, because he is not Harrison Ford. Isn't that obvious? I understand hardcore fans, that they have a very particular image of Han Solo from the original trilogy, but remember that the character in this movie is younger and therefore different from older self. Wanting Han Solo from this movie to be same as Han Solo from original trilogy is ludicrous.The story itself. Well, I have to admit it is not the best and brightest screenplay of the year. Heck, it is simply not that great whatsoever. I had myself few of those weird moments during the movie when it felt literally like some RPG game, when you have done your quest and you are asking yourself: now what? Actually you hear that sentence in the movie! Which only proves that the whole story could be done better. Still it was nice to watch, entertaining and captivating without the moments of boredom. Lots of small referrals to the original story, which I think fans should enjoy. I also don't understand negativity regarding the fact that ''this story does not bring anything new to the table''. Well, it was obvious from the beginning that Han needs to meet Chewie, fly Falcon, get it from Lando and just do things that does not mess with the movies that are further chronologically. Still, you need to know this is more action movie than an epic story of a outlast in a galaxy far, far away.I am writing all of this because I just think that lots of the negative comments about the movie come from those fans who think after the original trilogy Star Wars suck. And well, I have to agree that it is visible that all those movies today are here to cash in the moment of Star Wars being on the hype again, but I still believe you can enjoy this movies being a Star Wars fan. Solo is a solid action movie, worth seeing. Nicely done, with some beautiful visuals and CGI done the proper way. There really is a lot to enjoy about it if you don't go to the cinema with some crazy over the roof expectations.Warning, a little bit of spoilers ahead.The Han - Qi'ra plot and love story. I think it ads to the movie, despite feeling a bit weird at the moments. Personally I get her motivation at the end of movie. I felt like she is so much involved into something bigger than her that she couldn't just fly away with Han. She had to leave him for his good. The director clearly shows the viewer that she had a moment of consideration and she really thought about leaving everything and going with Han. But she felt that it was not possible to have a happy life with him. Her motives not fully known but I feel that way rather than saying she's a surviver and she only does what is good for her. Remember at the very beginning of the movie she was screaming to Han to let go and run, leaving her behind. Wanting him to escape and being happy for him succeeding. I am just not convinced for the whole ''she does only what is best for her'' thing. Oh, and in my opinion thinking that she was owned by Dryden is a huge misconception. She was held accountable by someone much more powerful from the very beginning. At least that is how I feel. Still it was weird that throughout the whole movie Qi'ra and Han didn't manage to talk over a few things. It is just lacking this moment of a deep conversation between them, which I just feel should happen at some point. Oh, and although finding someone you haven't seen for few years on the entire different place in the galaxy seems weird and some even say artificial, I am not so sure it couldn't happen in real life. Well, haven't you ever met your friend who lived in the same city but you haven't seen for years hundreds kilometres away? Trust me it happens.At the very end I have to say few words about the performance of Emilia Clarke and others. I enjoy kinda being infatuated by the female characters on the big screen. And trust me, Emilia Clarke puts a performance that you can get infatuated by. There is nothing not to appreciate about her acting. Woody Harrelson, Thandie Newton and Donald Glover are another rock solid actors whose performances were on point. And I had already talked about Alden Ehrenreich. Overall I would say that actor-wise the movie does not disappoint a bit.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

It had all the right ingredients (minus how to properly write specific scenes and showing us all the characters you are talking about in the film and maybe a couple other characters that are important in other Star Wars films - to make a better connection to those films with Solo). For the most part is was fine. Yes, I just used the word ""fine"" to describe a Star Wars film. Out of the 10 movies with a Star Wars title, it would be in the 7-9 range with Episode I being the worst. I think what could save this film is to have other Star Wars Story Films fill in some of the missing pieces. Maybe throw in more force using characters that tie in these one off stories. Basically, it felt like they just recited the lines in parts of the movie and didn't emphasize on certain points more. Lastly, there is opportunity to save the film if this had a sequel or a different Star Wars Story Film, like Kenobi or Boba Fett, that that tied it all together and filled in more missing info about Qi'ra and/or other characters.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

Eventhough i put the prequels on the bottom three of my favorite Star Wars film list, i still love all the prequels because they are ""Star Wars"" film. And as for Solo, the feeling i have after watching it was.. crushed.
Solo was boring at most, predictable, emotionless, and filled with political agenda. Not all things from Solo was bad though. I like the chemistry between Han and Chewie, also Lando was ok (need more screen time doing heroic act though). But the others was unmemorable, even the supposed to be nostalgic scenes was unmemorable to me. And the worst part was, the ruin-my-childhood-favorite-spaceship scene! I CAN NOT BELIEVE what they have done to the Millenium Falcon lore.

First of all, the actor they chose to play Han lacks all the charm and charisma of the character we've come to love. He's a painfully manufactured ""scoundrel"" and there is absolutely no spark between any of the characters. The storyline is terribly rushed. They obviously tried to cram as many references about Han Solo into 2 hours and 15 minutes as they could which came across sloppy, cheap and painfully obvious. There's a disappointing lack of any wit or humor in the dialog, so much so that sitting through this movie is dull and frankly, boring. This movie should have never been made.

After the disaster of the last Jedi I had set my expectations very low. And to be honest I would have skipped this movie if my brother did not forced me to go with him.
The movie started out pretty good, great characters and a promising plot. Especially the scene were Han singed up for the Empire. Emilia Clarke, Donald Glover and Woody Harrelson delivered a good performance. But then the movie took an whole other direction. And after that, the entire movie was foreseeable. I quickly realized who was going to betray who, what was going to happen and so on. As soon as the feminist Droid was introduced I lost it. What on earth does feministic stuff has to do in starwars? As a movie goer I go into the cinema to have a good time, not to think about feminism and droid rights. Sure enough that must have been a creation of Kathleen Canedee's. Everything positiv was destroyed within an instant.
Overall the plot died pretty quickly after that and I just did not care anymore.
The movie had some fun moments yes, and as said before, Alden Ehrenreich did a very good performance. But overall it was just a very passable movie.
I hope they overthink which direction their going with star wars. And sure bringing back some old prequel characters is cool, but at the same time ....well... kinda lame.

Preparing myself for a cringe moment in dialogue that lets a scene down or poor acting...but thankfully the further the film went on the more reassured this move was in safe hands. 
I know the serious fans (which I consider myself to also be) will be looking for downfalls in Harrison's replacement and naturally your going to find them. He's not a dead ringer to say the least. His height is clearly off point, But after i got past all that and just enjoyed the film on it's merits it soon became a very thorough and enjoyable film with a well put together story. A few twists (even though perhaps not completely original), some great acting, a good balance of dry comedy moments and serious action sequences, and most important they got the characters down brilliantly....especially Chewy. Already Ive read how people are slating this film for one reason or other and you can tear it up all day long for not being perfect if your going in looking for areas of comparison, and your never gonna please evyone but for me Ron Howard has pretty much nailed it.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

2269,joonaskorhonen,I guess it was pretty good,6,23 May 2018,"I liked the movie overall but it was very predictable and too fast paced.
I could not get a hang of the characters because they were either fastly killed off or just left there with no background. The plot was very predictable with no surprising turns. Only thing that was a little surprising was darth mauls cameo.
The acting was good I guess. The new guys acting as han was good and gave a little more depth to the character. 
Overall I liked the movie. It was well shot and edited. The pace could have been a little slower though.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

2273,rfarrow-68825,Star Wars returns to glory-Don't believe the negativity,10,26 May 2018,"I have never submitted a review before but I felt compelled to write one for Solo: A Star Wars Story because I simply cannot believe the negative reaction from so many reviewers. I am a lifelong SW fan, starting at age 7 in 1977 to age 47 today. I have seen Ep 4, 5, and 6 upwards of 300 times each, much to the chagrin of my wife. I love it more than any other franchise in movie history.The original trilogy was pure magic that will never be duplicated. The prequels didn't compare but each had their great (and awful) points. The last 50 minutes of Rogue One were as good as any in the catalog. I loved The Force Awakens and despised The Last Jedi, although my hatred subsides a little with each viewing. I am not some blind ""I love it just because it's SW"" kinda guy.Now that I have bored you with my backstory, on to Solo. This film is as flawless of an addition to the SW universe as I could have imagined. I went in with zero expectations given my feelings for TLJ and was absolutely blown away. It is the first SW film since ROTJ that gave me that goosebumpy, giddy, happy feeling I had as a kid. It is just pure fun from start to finish.It has great action, great pacing, incredible effects, and the acting is very good. Compared to TLJ, the plot is Oscar worthy lol. The kid that plays Han does as good of a job as anyone could filling the shoes of Harrison Ford. His mannerisms, facial expressions, and dialogue delivery are spot-on and believable as a younger, not as hardened version of Solo. Lando is equally good if not better. The rest of the cast do a fine job as well. Reviewers are complaining about ""lack of character development."" Really?? Han, Chewie, and Lando have been developed for 40 years! We know who they are and what they are all about already. This film takes what we know and just shows you glimpses of their story that we all know and love. Shut up and go watch some boring Oscar winning crap that you pretend to like so people think you're cool, cultured, and hip. It is Star Wars for Pete's sake, get over yourself.Others are complaining about the movie showing ""obvious"" fan-boy points in Han's story. (Kessel run, winning the Falcon, meeting Chewie, etc) WTF did you want to see? Han Solo's first day of elementary school? Han hanging out with his buddies watching space porn as a young lad? Picking out his first white shirt and black vest? Come on, really? Again, go watch No Country For Old Men and debate the meaning behind the worst ending in movie history while swirling wine at the yacht club you holier-than-thou jackasses.And let's not forget the ""it's a cash grab"" crowd. No kidding?? A summer action blockbuster is a cash grab?? WHAT?? No, get out??!?Wow, that's never happened before. I bet the next Black Panther movie will only be screened at Cannes. It makes money because people like it. Enjoy your next Woody Allen movie douchebag.Many people seem to be simply incapable of having a good time at a movie. Don't believe the nonsense. Go, sit back, take it in, and enjoy the ride.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

Make me forget about the world (and galaxy) we know and take me along a journey of one of our favorite heroes.Is it perfect? Of course not, but the film made me feel tension, happiness, bit of sadness. All sorts of feelings I get when a movie pulls me in and takes me on an adventure.How a movie like TLJ makes people feel that way for that film and not this one is something I probably will never understand.Keep them coming because this is exactly the kind of experience I go to a theatre for on a random Thursday night.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

Wow, was I blown away! What a fun and exciting movie this was, and such a great example of what a Star Wars film should be about. 
The conclusion is a little foregone, but they did a great job here! There's a lot of criticism going about regarding L337 the droid and other things, but honestly, I don't believe all the negative reviews have even watched the same film. I found it to be great fun.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

The story was strong (we could connect with all the characters) , the action was visually engaging (we felt present and engaged with all the scenes without being overwhelmed).

2288,houseshaker,"So much promise, alas another disappointment",4,9 June 2018,"Firstly, let me say I AM a Star Wars fan. Secondly, I loved the boldness of Rogue One but now they're saying that was only an experimental film? Well, we need more of that type of substance. The thing that is lacking in both the Last Jedi and Solo is a truly menacing villain and heroes we can identify with and cheer for ( apart from Chewbacca who I thought was a great inclusion).
Alden Endenreich as Han gives a wooden performance and lacks Harrison Fords easy going style, it's almost like a parody of the original character. This guy smiles through 90% of the movie, Ron Howard must have thought he looked more like Ford when he did so...he keeps smiling urgh!
Emilia Clarke who I live in GOT and Me Before You is terrible and the two together have zero chemistry, plus they're both very very short which stands out on film unfortunately, even the female cast tower over Han?
We see Darth Maul towards the end of the film wtf? This would make Han Solo close to 60 at the time of A New Hope?? Big mistake! Han joins the Empire to fly and we hear he was kicked out of flight school, here was an opportunity gone begging, that's what the fans want to see....the Rebel in Han that's what made the character great is his devil may care attitude in the first 3 films. Anyhow, save your money and wait for the blu ray or DVD release I was so disappointed in pretty much everything about this film. Go see The Avengers Infinity War instead it's fantastic lol",Solo - A Star Wars Story
2289,thae-03394,Not even Ron Howard could save this one,2,25 May 2018,"Solo is a complete trainwreck, exactly what one would expect after the chaos behind the scenes during production. You can pinpoint the exact moment when Ron Howard took over, but even he couldn't save the movie. The first hour and forty-five minutes is just non-stop dialogue, cheap jokes, and cringe-worthy lines. Somehow the previous directors managed to make experienced actors, like Paul Bettany and Woody Harrelson, look like amateurs, lost in a film with no clear plot. On top of poor character development, the movie defies reason by placing a giant, murderous, electrically-charged octopus next to a black hole in the middle of space.Lucasfilm should have followed Kylo Ren's advice after watching the mess that became Han Solo's backstory: let the past die; kill it, if you have to.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

From Starting chase sequence to Train heist to stealing from the planet , all in all is very entertaining, how Han had last name Solo, how he met chuwi, his Lucky Dice, favourite card game to win Millanium Falcon etc all very well presented. Yes, there are no deep character arcs and backstories but you dont need that. Flows very well and earn my full respects.

2292,KatiplierWinchester,Exceeded my expectations!,9,25 May 2018,"I'm not one to criticize the Star Wars films harshly as many fans do, I've loved every single one of them so far, and enjoy both the Clone Wars and Rebels TV shows. Solo is no exception!I was initially skeptical with Alden's casting, however, after watching the movie, I take back any of the reservations I had. He channeled Ford really well, especially in regards to mannerisms and inflections. I know some people thought that Alden didn't look exactly like a young Harrison Ford, but I have a feeling his casting may have also been inspired by River Phoenix in Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. By the end of the film, it's apparent that Alden has done an incredible job taking on such a important role. I applaud him for it!Donald Glover's casting as Lando was also fantastic! He oozed the similar charisma and charm as of Billy Dee's Lando. Qi'ra was a more mysterious character than I assumed she'd be, and I thought Emilia Clarke was great, but I wish they had given a little more backstory to her character. Otherwise, Qi'ra was very interesting, I'd like to know more about her. 
Joonas Suotamo was superb as Chewbacca, and he's already done a great job in TFA and TLJ, but it was nice to see him with a larger role this time around. Phoebe Waller-Bridge's L3-37 was very endearing, and I love it when they give each droid a distinct and unique personality. I enjoyed the dynamic between her and Lando.Paul Bettany's portrayal of Dryden Vos was quite surprising, he most recently played Vision in Avengers: Infinity War, so I assumed I wouldn't find him too intimidating. I was clearly wrong. The way he carried himself was imposing, and despite the fact his words were blunt and threatening, his casual passive-aggressive delivery and manner of speech made it even more perfectly terrifying.
Woody Harrelson, Thandie Newton, and Jon Favreau also deserve praise as Beckett, Val, and Rio, respectively. 
I thought the entire cast did an excellent job, and without any one of them, the film would feel a little off balance. They all added their own unique elements and personality to the movie.I pretty much loved every minute of the film, it kept me on the edge of my seat the entire time. I personally found it thrilling to learn about Han's history, which was only mentioned briefly in a few lines in the original trilogy. Similar to how both the Prequels and Rogue One were events only alluded to in the original films, it's great to see iconic moments in Star Wars history expanded upon and shown visually.There were many nods to various characters and the foreshadowing of future events that have already been established that were thoroughly enjoyable.
There's also one shocking reveal towards the end of the film that had me completely surprised - if you haven't seen The Clone Wars or Rebels, I would recommend you watch a few specific episodes afterward to understand. I love the fact that they tied that in, it was something I've been waiting for them to address in the movies, and I'm very glad they did.All in all, it was a terrific film! I really hope skeptical fans will drop their preconceived opinions because I have a feeling that they will be pleasantly surprised. I give it a 9/10, the only reason that it's not a solid 10/10 is because I feel like some characters weren't fleshed out enough and didn't get enough screen time, and I would've liked to know more about them.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

2301,petarilievpetrov,It's a good movie that wasn't made for you - and that's all right,7,24 May 2018,"-How does this movie fit into the franchise? 
-Poorly. 
It's an adventure movie/space western that only gives the slightest of nods to the overarching conflict in the SW universe. Sadly, it also offers no additional insight into the ways Han is predestined to go on to try and fail at making love last; no new angle on parent-child relationships that would add a dimension to the dynamics in the new trilogy. The movie restrains itself to mere showing on screen things that were already known or implied about the character in existing material.-Is this an origin story? 
-No. 
This movie never shows Han Solo becoming Han Solo, save for the last name. The character starts out brave, optimistic, sharp, capable and charming and ends exactly there, albeit a tiny bit more broken-hearted. His morals and values do not undergo any development - he is caring, willing to help by putting himself at risk, emphatic and forgiving. This not only feels static on screen, it also undercuts major plot points as it sucks out what little tension is left in a movie that you know is going to end with this character intact. He battles no inner demons, he does not make a single mistake or poor judgement, he doesn't change or grow in any major way. Where ever the origins of Han Solo lie, it must be way further back. -Is the movie fun at all? 
-Absolutely. 
Action scenes are well executed, it is visually impressive on a grand scale and in the details, all in all - given the publicized production mess - it turned out fine, to say the least.-What about the characters and actors' performances? 
-Underwritten and all over the place. 
I cannot help but admire Alden Ehrenreich's commitment to the body language of the character, the vocals, facial expressions - it's a performance that shows both dedication and respect for the original actor. Yet he isn't given a chance to portray any inner conflict, turmoil or growth and his talents are simply underused. Donald Glover is almost downplaying his charisma and still has plenty left in what is more of a presence than a performance. Grossly underwritten, Lando is to this movie what the Joker is to Suicide Squad - he is owed an apology and a titular movie. Woody Harrelson and Paul Bettany both give solid performances of more or less the same character - the one that will kindly further the plot. Having little to work with, they both deliver on par with any recent action movie that would get much more praise and recognition. Female characters are disappointingly problematic. Thandie Newton, who has again and again proven capable of delivering moving and nuanced performances, has her hands tied in a role of a 'girl with a gun' (and a boring one at that), who is quickly sacrificed at no emotional cost to the audience. The attempt to add gravitas to her death by declaring her to be romantically involved with Woody Harrelson's character is immediately undercut by the fact that he doesn't spend 5 seconds mourning her loss and it does not affect him or his reactions for the rest of the film. L3 gives off a parody vibe that is ill-compatible with the gravity of her concerns which are played for laughs. No freedom of thought and conscience, absence of choice, subjugation - breaking free of that and leading an independent existence while still being emphatic and concerned for all the others that are still literally and metaphorically in chains - this is a source of comic relief in this movie. Qi'ra's character is what Evangeline Lily's Tauriel is to the Hobbit - completely superfluous and willed into existence for all the wrong reasons. Han Solo's character's motivation wouldn't change one bit if she wasn't there. He'd still want to leave that hellhole Chandrilla. He'd still not want to remain in the forefront of the battlefield and seek a way out. He insists he wants to go back for her but this plot is sidelined by the fact that he never gets around to doing that and it isn't affecting the plot in any way. He could have left Chandrilla in search for a better life and stumbled upon the heist party and Chewie just as good. Once she is tacked onto the team, Qi'ra serves as being distinctly female onscreen for the rest of the movie. How do the writers try to anchor her in the story? Predictably, by appointing her to be Han's love interest and involving an established SWU character. Both attempts fail as a compelling love story involving Han Solo has already been done and no amount of sith entanglement can save a hollow character that does not serve the plot and does not have affecting interactions with the other characters save for two mildly passionate kisses.And then there's Lily Newmark's Lexi. A world-of-badass character with a whole gang of diverse members of peoples who have been affected by a galactic struggle for resources, fighting for the cause of the rebellion? That's a whole movie in itself, and a good one, I dare say. Do that, Disney. Newmark will rock it.Chewbacca is a rare win. Joonas Suotamo is subtle, engaging, consistent in his delivery and a delightful presence onscreen. More Chewbacca, please. Please. -How do I rate this movie a solid 7/10?
I measure it by what it is, not by what it isn't.All the aspects of this movie that make it less than enjoyable experience for me are predicated on the fact that I am an adult. A long standing fan of the original movies, with a good (but far from exhaustive) knowledge of the SW universe, with a particular fondness for the character of Han Solo - one would consider me a target audience for this release. The trailers surely didn't do anything to make me reconsider that. But this movie is definitely not made to be enjoyed by adult viewers, it is instead meant to engage a much younger audience of under 13 year olds. And that's great. The new trilogy did a lot in attracting a younger audience to the franchise and was a particular hit with girls by dealing with themes concerning adolescence, difficult family relationships, generation gaps, struggling to find identity and purpose. But these topics are a tad too mature for pre-adolescents, the ones who would find their way into the franchise through the joy of adventure, both as a genre and a theme. This movie is purposefully crafted to appeal to a child and very obviously so.The embarrassing level of exposition that his the viewer right from the start is not out of place with young children - they need clarification why Han Solo is practically stealing for it goes against general parental guidelines. They also need a 'stable' main character, one that does not change, if he is to be surrounded by 'bad' guys or ones that will flip (one way or the other). It is in movies for children that the main character has to be explicitly told he is 'the good guy' and he is not allowed to have even the slightest moral failing that cannot be brushed away as bluffing - children simply lack the experience to delve into the complexities that surround poor judgements and bad decisions. Instead of confusing them, this movie gives them 'a good guy' to root for, one that is unfailing in his bravery, openness to making new friends and willingness to do the right thing. It does so in a way that is entertaining and action packed while still remaining a calculatedly low-stakes risk as children know, entering the cinema, that the main characters will come out on the other side of this adventure unharmed both physically and relationship-wise. The movie's orientation towards children is also the reason why Qi'ra's character rigs so hollow - in this format it is impossible to explore the layers of a young woman with a troubled childhood/adolescence on a lawless planet, who loses her last person of confidence, reliance and shared vulnerability. The movie awkwardly tiptoes around her 'missing years' and all the 'bad things' she's supposedly done, but for the purposes of lessening the burden on young viewers and for Han Solo to have feelings for her in a way that is not morally conflicted or conflicting, Qi'ra is sacrificed to a point that renders her presence in the story little more than a service to gender ratio. 
L3's treatment is also only explainable viewed through the lense of scratching the surface of profound topics in a way that is not too destabilizing for young children. If this is a way to introduce new, young fans to the Star Wars universe and lay the foundations for the soon-to-be-made movies, it is a welcome effort and an understandable choice. It remains unclear why it has not been marketed that way - if there were any fears of alienating the existing fan base, they cannot be laid to rest by delivering a product that is so far from what fans hope to see. Subverting expectations is a powerful choice and works (to a point) in the new trilogy, but in this case it is simply confusing for Han Solo fans - the emotional payoff is so low when compared with the grand setup, that disappointment is inevitable when leaving the theatre asking - What was that about? 
The answer should have been at the core of the PR campaign message, priming the audiences for a way to introduce the children in their lives to a universe they love in a fun and safe way. That's where the movie succeeds and in light of this - well done, Han.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
2302,thrustweight,Thoroughly enjoyable,7,24 May 2018,"This is a Han Solo film and so isn't supposed to be weighed down with much other than a lot of hairy situations, and quick thinking and surprises, this film delivers all three.

It requires a giant tub of popcorn. Nothing since the original trilogy will ever compare, because everything since has tried to carbon copy the original franchise without realizing it needs a soul behind it, too. Solo is a fun movie if you can let down your Star Wars protective shield for just a little while. Go see it, and try to let go just a little bit. You might just enjoy it:",Solo - A Star Wars Story

The character development was spot on, and I felt a personally connection with every character. Star wars movies have always been sort of campy, and for people to discredit a film before even watching it is ridiculous. It was like watching Star Trek with Chris Pine all over again. I gave it a 10 to help uptake all the 1/10 that were given before the movie was even released. It deserves at least a solid 8/10 though. Those 1/10 reviews before the release of the film should be wiped clean.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

Even my wife who doesn't really watch Star Wars fanatically like I do, said she wanted to see it again, because she really enjoyed it. Honestly, Alden plays Han perfectly, so many of Harrisons maneurisms just smoothly slide by, and you are absolutely cool with it and will find yourself smiling. Lando is perfect too, Gambino does a great job, i will say he slides in and out of Lando's tone and voice a few times, but its only noticeable if you are looking for Lando's tone the whole time, otherwise he nails it. Q'ira is great, and really helps you see why Han becomes the kind of person he is in the OT movies. DO NOT LISTEN to other people about this movie if they say dumb things like ""Its a cash grab', or ""Stupid DIsney"" because guess what Disney is doing what we only imagined would happen, they are telling more Star Wars stories for us. And they bought it, so they have the right to make some tweaks, so for those who argue it isn't Legends accurate, tell them to buy the franchise so they can have input, until then, sit down eat your popcorn and enjoy the movie, please silence your phones!!

2318,sheenwal,The original Han Solo trilogy was much more better,4,30 May 2018,"In 1997-98 A. C. Crispin wrote the original story of Han Solo which contains the story from it's childhood to the New Hope (and a little plot for the Rouge One). This trilogy (The Paradise Snare; The Hutt Gambit; Rebel Dawn) show a fully different Solo and all the other characters have a stronger and more serious role in the story. There were more unique characters, species, planets and scenes. The story of the trilogy is magnificent.In this movie the planets were poorly, there were no a big scene, only small villages and nooks. The story was nothing. The war scene was a joke, in this time the Empire has no enemy at all. The emperor regime crush everybody who try to engage a full scale battle. 
Railway in a rocky mountain planet on the surface? What? In the age of the repulsorlift vehicles? The story writers do not know the Star Wars technology. The Falcon still (in the Disney era) was an incredible durable ship. After the escape from the Maw, the Falcon need minimum a week constant repair before the next flight in the real SW universe. 
Battleship size Space Monster in the Maw, in the super gravity fields. What is it? A B category sci-fi movie?
The characters were week although the their acting was acceptable. Only the droid performance (L3-37) was terrible. In the original Solo trilogy Lando's droid was a very cool character.To sum up: this movie was a garbage, the original Han Solo Trilogy is light years better than this.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

2320,tommyvanaalst,Awesome film!,10,26 May 2018,"I really enjoyed the film, as I enjoy every other Star Wars film and I recommend any Star Wars fan going to see it. Go and see it and enjoy every minute of it. You will be in the cinema watching a new Star Wars film for the first time, with a new story to be told.Ill quickly go over everyone else's negative points about the film and why they shouldn't be:For some reason people like to complain about this film, and use the same two points:
1. ""Its not the real Han Solo, I want Harrison Ford"". Really, because a 75 year old is going to play a 20/30 year old. The only other way would be to have a computer generated Han Solo. Which for the main character in a film is not a good idea.
I think Alden Ehrenreich does a brilliant job of trying to follow how Harrison Ford portrayed Han Solo, speaks the same way, same actions, same standing pose, same gunshot pose and a lot more. Just seeing his face and saying "" thats not Han Solo"" is your own fault and you deserve nothing out of this film.
2. ""Its just made for the money"". So what, everyone who worked on the film tried hard to make a good film, of course it needs to make money, however its another Star Wars film I get to see on the big screen, another story I get to experience and I want them to make more. If you are an actual Star Wars fan you will enjoy the film. They want to give you more to enjoy, so enjoy it and stop complaining.Just to finish up, the other actors were great and the story was fun and entertaining. Its awesome to learn about Han Solo before we seem him in Episode 4, and to see more of the Star Wars universe. Now go and enjoy the film!",Solo - A Star Wars Story

Alden Ehrenreich is a perfectly good younger Han Solo, and all the other actors are great. 
I am a die hard Star Wars fan since 1977, and to me the Force and the jedi are the most important ingredients. As expected they are absent this time around. But there are plenty of names and details here to thrill the fans. Oh, and one major surprise.

2322,slimblimp,Rian Johnson could stand to learn from this movie's strengths,8,17 January 2019,"This movie is honestly amazing. It fails to take itself seriously but it does so in all the right ways. I personally love going back to re-watch the cinematics of classic Star Wars properties such as Dark Forces II. I feel like this movie captures the understanding that Star Wars, in its presentation, doesn't have to be incredibly serious but that, fundamentally, it has to take its subject matter seriously. I like that the makers of this movie clearly understand that, and I hope if Star Wars exists well into the future, this is what it looks like. Also, the color palette of this movie is utterly gorgeous, containing some of the most beautiful imagery I've seen in a movie. I found it so enjoyable to watch I was far too often unaware of what was actually happening in the story. So if anything bad can be said of this movie I suppose that is it. Also, the music is incredibly unremarkable to a noticeable fault. I don't understand why they don't hire someone like Jeremy Soule to provide the soundtrack for these movies. It almost seems that Lucasfilm is going out of its way at this point to avoid hiring talent, both in the writer's room particularly but also regarding the scoring of these stand alone movies. I also fail to understand how a movie that should so clearly be about Dash Rendar can be called 'Solo'.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
2323,ryan_arjoon,Solo is enjoyable but never hits the mark,5,16 October 2018,Solo is not as good as you might want. There is very little story and character to chew on. There are sparks of what this movie could be with a remarkably fun train heist and a charming love interest for Han. The dialogue and characters being poorly written drowns out many of the good. I enjoyed how the call backs to the originals were woven into the story it never felt forced. The call backs do leave a bit to be desired.

But the plot is a numb and boring queue of just, and really just name-calling and lame presentations of actually cool backstories of each character. Motivations and story driving aspects are uninteresting - nothing special here - and some moments are forced as hell: like for example the sudden (or rather not so suprising) showcasing of half-cyborg Darth Maul close to the end.I think it is, especially in this case, not necessary to defend or try to justify whether or not you are a Star Wars/scifi fan. It is, fully objectively, a boring movie to begin with.

Han is unfortunately not as great as Harrison's, how could he be? But there are great characters and no cute fluffy things.

The story is generic, very typical sci fi scene it before blah blah, without the star wars brand theres not much to seperate it from other entries in sci fi, the writing is pretty consistent although no major griping moments occur that made me feel invested, instead me and my friends found ourselfs laughing out loud at what should otherwise be a serious moment in the movie. Some of the dialogue however had me cringing so hard that my ass took a bite out of my seat. This movie as with the new enteries to star wars, kinders to children more then any other age range with very basic concepts and arcs being tackled by the movie which isnt necassarily always bad but i would have liked a little more substance.One of the movies bigger downfalls is its obsession with trying to link our new solo to the one we know and love, with the movie spending way to much time establishing references to the original trilogy then was needed, we want to fine out more about the characters not relearn what we already know. I did enjoy Aldens performence as solo and think he did a good job but only his performence seemed to stand out. I also thought donald glover was perfect in the role of landoAll in all kids will love the movie, plenty of colourful imagery and special effects to keep them interested but not much else for more hardcore star wars fans.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
2337,adamreader,Fun Star Wars cheese!,7,1 June 2018,"Solo: A Star Wars Story (2018)Review by Adam Reader. Solo a Star Wars story was a movie from Lucasfilms/Disney no one really asked for but we got anyway. Production for this movie has been from the start, with directors changing half way through production, and nearly unknown actor cast as the infamous Han Solo many people had lost all hope for the next theatrical instalment in one of the greatest fictional universes ever created, but alas this movie really surprised me. 
Despite what other reviewers have said I found Alden Ehrenreich a fantastic choice for the titular character. Many wanted a imitation of Harrison Ford, but Alden had the moments of charm and arrogance that comes from the galaxy's best pilot, but still had the boyish charm that proceeds any smooth talking quick witted character. And Donald glover as Lando Calrissian may have been one of the best casting decisions in the re-booted Star Wars universe. He had the charm, wit, and screen presence Billy Dee Williams brought to the character 38 years ago in Empire Strikes Back. Chewie is always a delight on screen, and the additional characters performed by Woody Harrelson, Emilia Clarke, and Paul Bettany worked well with the story and were portrayed with the usual brilliance of the actors. As far as story goes it was a fairly standard, by the books action sci-fi adventure. There was nothing particularly mind blowing or spectacular in the story telling, but if you love a good sci-fi heist movie you'll probably enjoy this one. On top of the heist plot it also beings a lot of Star Wars cheesy nostalgia that was the be expected, teaching us about many classic Han Solo stories like the meeting of Lando, Chewie, and completing the Kessel run. There was a nice surprise cameo at the end that I did not expect. 
 
All in all it I found it a fun and enjoyable movie, but nothing out of the classic sci-fi movie tropes. The characters were enjoyable and fun to see in their pre-original trilogy days and it brought a lot of nostalgia from the galaxy far, far which I personally always enjoy7/10",Solo - A Star Wars Story

2339,bentunstead,Solo - A Superb story but not a franchise favourite !,7,23 June 2018,"Solo, is a creative bunch of action, fun and joy, technologically stunning, although the new dialogue across the franchise is lacking and less than top notch, I feel that as Disney released more motion pictures, each time the quality of the induvial moment and the key pivotal dialogue worsens and the acting of this is quite poor. overall a Good family film but not anywhere near the Lucas Lucasfilm quality, despite retaining some continuity across the board. definitively a Good addition despite Box office turnover, something to build on and another great film under the space belt for Kathleen Kennedy and the new Lucasfilm, a bit more Star Trek than Star Wars but not much to moan about there. some famous faces and some relatable definitely more an English audience Film than an American as so many well-known English Actors some of whom will not have been that well known in the states. a little weightless like a fry-up without the hash brown, because of the lack of solid structure, some people in audience said 'boring' I think it definitely required a more tuned in eye to stay on the ball, no more porg! or a new creature shame because we could do with another plushie, and Porg was a great one, good for the kids. I think it did at points lack substance and motivation, but what it lost in quality and foundation it made up for in classic charisma, overall not to bad but not quite Disney or Lucasfilm Quality. despite being better than some other franchises out there. I would say a 7 of 10. Good with morals though and really quite ethical similar to the casino scenes in last Jedi, some good links there. Something to build on but they shouldn't have any regrets as It is a tough industry and just gets tougher to please people. Anyway, lets view the glass half full and say many fans will be exited for the next instalment and spin off (if happening). 
worth a watch, maybe on DVD rather than cinema though.

2341,djmcghee-69855,True to the saga,8,24 May 2018,"As expected, the film has been met with huge criticism, which in my opinion is wholly unjust and just another opportunity for so called 'star wars' fans to voice their disapproval for Disney. Solo is not the biggest and boldest SW feature by any stretch, but it is true to the original trilogy material without resorting to overly complicated plots, ropey CGI effects and forced comedy. It provides action , excitement, great dialogue, romance and a vast array of alien creatures (that were lacking in Rogue 1) and genuinely feels like a SW film, albeit with an interesting western inspired spin. Its Star Wars with everything we love about the saga. If you hate it.. perhaps its time you realised you might not be a SW fan after all.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
2342,Grey_is_OK,Ron Howard = hero,8,12 June 2018,"I let pessimism delay my viewing of Solo. In short: I loved it. Solo manage to transform my hopeless nausea for all things Star Wars into renewed faith. The Batman-ish soundtrack during the first speeder chase was off-putting, but once the music started riffing on it's origins it sounded great. My only other gripe was the look of the freed-slave Wookiees on Kessel. I love the star-crossed friend/partner/lover dynamic of Qi'ra and Han. 
A little romance has been so needed in SW films. The unrequited open-endedness of it nicely forshadows unfolding patterns in the destinies of our protagonists. Donald Glover is just superb as Lando and clearly studied the character. I loved learning how the Millennium Falcon became forever infused with the personality of L3, and knowing who R2 and 3PO were communing with through all their attempts at helping her limp through countless misadventures with Han & Chewie. And yay--Warwick Davis unburdened by the rubber guise of a goofy creature (yes, much like in TPM but better!)I'm embarrassed by my former cynicism. 
I apologize to any Star Wars fan on whom I may have projected my profound disappointment of The Last Jedi... and possibly influenced their decision on whether or not to see Solo. Please go!It's a marvelous big screen surround-sound summer Joyride!
And yes, we needed it. It's a worthy addition to the franchise and if I could personally shake Ron Howard's hand in gratitude I would. He should be handed the SW baton (lightsaber) permanently, moving forward.This movie has great depth + character development and it completely snapped me out of my angst and rancor re: The Last Jedi**(Sorry, but Finn should have gone off and trained with Master Luke Skywalker and become a Jedi along w/his sweetie Rey!!

2343,jordanwbrooks,The kind of story the original movies left you pining for. - 8/10,8,22 May 2018,"So I went into this movie not expecting much since I knew of the multiple director transitions and such. However, I really do like Ron Howard's work and I was surprised to hear that this is one of the first Star Wars movies to have an Academy Award winning director at the helm (I could be wrong on that?). I also have been slightly skeptical of these Star Wars Stories because I'm worried that Disney is going to be ""milking their cash cow"" too much. Regardless of that, the movie was thoroughly entertaining for me. I have loved Star Wars since I was a kid and the original trilogy created a world so rich in imagination that it always left me wanting to stay there and dive into more stories and know more about our heroes. This movie totally did that and took us to places we haven't seen before, and showed us different perspectives of the Star Wars galaxy that we've not seen. It was great! The story was a little simple but the characters are strong enough to captivate you and every actor does an excellent job in their respective roles.

After reading all the bad press leading up to the release of the film over the last year and a half, my expectations for a good movie were not high. Luckily, I was pleasantly surprised. The Wife and I went to the drive In to see it Sunday night and we both enjoyed it a lot. She really, really liked it and kept asking ""Why is this movie getting crapped on by everyone!?"" It was a fun movie, gave us background stories on beloved characters, had some action, some humor and a little romance. We loved L3, especially as she found her destiny to be a robotic liberator. She had us laughing and cheering her on. Woody Harrelson was great as always. I dug Don Glover's Lando, enjoyed finally seeing the Spice Mines and the Kessel run being made in under 12 parsecs, loved how the second game of Sabacc ended up getting Han the Falcon, and I even ended up accepting and liking Alden Ehrenreich as Han Solo by the end of the film. As a grade, I give it a solid B, maybe even a B+.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

THey made such a big deal in past movies to CGI the characters to make them look like the originals. Why not cast anthony ingruber as solo? He is Harrison's ford look alike and is the only solo I would have accepted! Die hard star wars fans please don't waste your time watching this terrible movie!

2354,villaengle-38586,"Not too good, but pretty bad",4,22 May 2018,"Solo: A Star Wars Story does not seem like a disappointment at first glance, that is of course at first glance. When I went to see Solo I was excited but not overjoyed or hyped, recently I have been angered and annoyed by the amount of Star Wars movies that have been made without any real thought put into them. Rogue One was a money project, not a passion project. Also while this movie is not a politically correct as recent movies, it still clearly has a hidden agenda. Agendas like this are harmful to our children and will sway their opinions for life. Now back to my seeing of it, when I saw Solo there were TONS and I mean TONS of fan boys. They will tell you it was perfect and amazing, and I know that because I missed half the dialogue from their clapping. The reason they will tell you it was amazing is because this movie is a pander fest. Reference to extended universe here, reference to the prequels there, it was a mess of references just like Ready Player One. Now the acting, the main two actors that stood out were Donald Glover and Alden. First Alden: He was AMAZING, just like a little Harrison Ford, he captured the personality of Han Solo so perfectly that I wouldn't mind seeing Laden in an Indiana Jones movie or two. Now Donald Glover: unbelievable and horrible is all I can say. Noting he said was convincing or felt like it had any impact on the movie or audience. This is why you don't hire a MUSIC artist as an ACTOR. Two forms of entertainment that should only mix in the soundtrack. 
Overall this is just one movie in the plethora of Star Wars over saturated garbage that will be released. This is why I gave Solo: A Star Wars Story a 4/10. I can only hope they slow down the making of these movies and put thought and passion into new Star Wars movies.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
2355,dwillenn,Way better than I thought it would be !,9,23 May 2018,"I think I was one of the many people who thought this would be a complete flop. And I must say that I was pleasantly surprised to find out I was completely wrong.The thing that scared me the most, was Alden's version of Solo, and at first you might think he's going to be horrible, but after about thirty minutes, he shows how much he has improved as an actor and how well he plays his character. You can see by the way he moves that he took inspiration in Harrison Ford's Han Solo, but he was able to create a new version of Solo, his own version. He gives his own twist to Solo's character (it's also due to the fact that he plays a much younger and 'dynamic' Solo than in the original trilogy) and is able to make Solo this formidable character (When I finished the movie my first thought that it'd be nice if we could see more of Alden's Solo in future projects situated in this period of time).Now, Lando. Donald Glover (AKA Childish Gambino for those who might only know him under this name) portrayed a version of Lando, that I personally appreciate more than Billy Dee Williams' one. First of all, I really appreciated his humorous manners when they first meet him, but what really touched me, was the way Glover was able to transfer emotions when his partner dies.This scene was really touching. And over all, Donald Glover was able to give Lando what Billy Dee Williams couldn't. Besides being a pompous felon, we could also see that he is a caring one, and really approchable one.Tobias Beckett, what could I say more except the fact that as always, Woody Harrelson never disappoints a viewer. His portrayal of the lonely smuggler was great, and up until the end, I thought he would still be one of the nice guys. This plot twist came up to me unexpected, when I saw this treasonous scene, it reminded me of DJ's (Benicio Del Toro) betrayal in The Last Jedi, only much better, far more unexpected, and with better acting (Although Benicio is a great actor too).Paul Bettany's portrayal of Dryden Vos was splendid, I can't even think of a better actor to play Dryden, he was just perfect for this role. I think I will be one of the few to say that I'd actually want to know more about him, his race, his story, his home planet, and in general see more of him. If he was to appear in another Star Wars project situated in this period of time, I think he'd make a great vilain. (I actually really appreciated the fact that despite being a bandit and a killer, he still is honorable and honors a deal)Chewbacca was great in this movie, especially the way they twisted his meeting with Han (I especially loved it whan Han spoke in Wookie language to him!) and seeing a young Chewbacca is great. Also, the way he liberated the slaves on Kessel, and the way he said goodbye to the other Wookie (I think his name's Sawga although I didn't fully catch that) made me feel like this portrayal of Chewbacca really looks like Chewbacca should be, that it is really loyal to the original Chewie. I think it's a shame that Rio wasn't shown more, I understand that he was a secondary character, but he could have been great, so special mention to him.And, last but not least, the best for the end, Emilia Clarke.
Once again Emilia Clarke has shown us how great of an actor she is, and for me, Qi'ra was one of her best performances yet. Her character was really interesting and I loved how they made her relationship with Han evolve, and leaving us on a bit of a confusion to whether or not they still love each other. Overall, she has played a character that you could fall in love with (and I think that if I was at Solo's place, it would have been really difficult to not do so).
Overall, I give the movie a 9 out of 10. I think that this movie is actually my favorite by far out of the four last episodes in the Star Wars series.
I'd recommend this movie to everybody, and I hope that those who doubted it will change their minds, and that we will be able to see more Star Wars content of such quality.PS : I forgot to mention Ron Howard's excellent job, nothing to say about it, just, excellent.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
2356,asiuapau,Great Star Wars for Adult ! Why so underrated on imdb? I just watched it and it was great! at least 8 of 10!,8,23 May 2018,"I watched Solo on Wed, 23 of May 2018 at XXI at Baywalk Mall Pluit in Jakarta, Indonesia and didn't have much expectation as it shows low rating on IMDB (around 5.6 smthg). However, i was very surprised with the outcome. This movie is great, but why it shows such low rating here. Emilia Clarke performs so well here and i think she needs no 'blood of the dragon' any longer, as she looks hot here too. The American actor casted as Han Solo worried me a bit in the opening of the movie as he looks somehow a very serious personality compared to Han Solo played by Harrison Ford (a character which should be such a funny douche bag), but as the movie moves from scene to scene, the character played by Aldenrich convinces me that he is that Han Solo just like in the original Star Wars. I can't wait for the sequel, and don't tell me i don't know Star Wars, I grew up with it and already saw all Star Wars Movies from 1 to 6, and all the disney sequels.

Now, I just came back from Solo: A Star Wars Story and I really felt the urge to create an account and review this movie.Solo: A Star Wars Story felt empty. I will not bother you with any spoilers. There were some cool scenes, but I feel like nothing is memorable. On top of that, characters behaved plain stupid many times and illogically. This is just the kind of action movie that is like any other action movie. The story was so unoriginal and boring that I still feel sick in my stomach by realizing how much potential they wasted - once again.I am a fan of the Originals and think the Prequels are pretty good. I loved Rogue One, but just like The Force Awakens and The Last Jedi this movie wastes so much potential. Only this time, they wasted more potential than ever. This movie is slightly better than the Finn and Rose scenes in Episode 8.Still, because it is Star Wars - and only because it is Star Wars - I rate it a 5 out of 10. But a strong brand cannot stay strong if it does not produce strong movies anymore. Something Disney needs to keep in mind.

2360,wbonaccorso,Low Expectations. Great Outcome?,8,24 May 2018,"What can I say? Solo: A Star Wars Story is without a doubt one of the most entertaining films in the saga, clearly back to the standards which Star Wars fans have been wanting. Ever since the announcement of this film as part of the anthology films which Disney look to develop, many believed it would turn out to be detrimental to the Star Wars saga. With the result of Johnson's take on with The Last Jedi and its perceptions of the film, many fans began to lose faith in their beloved film series. With troubles, from directing to reshoots, I began to follow this path as well. However, going into the cinema with low expectations, the end result actually turned out to what I was wanting, clearly transforming into a great classic for the many ages. Solo: A Star Wars Story is seen as a classic and potentially a new spark in the Disney era of Star Wars and with the surprise ending, I hope to see more of what I experienced in the years ahead.Fantastic job to all cast and crew especially Ron Howard, who took on a massive job to direct such a stunning and adventurous film, placing my faith back into this beloved film franchise.

2361,ferencszalay,Very good spin-off (no-spoilers),8,24 May 2018,"Personally I don't understand the negative ratings. This movie is better than the Lucas prequels the The Return of the Jedi or Force Awakens was. Probably some people still expect the same jaw-dropping impact and influence on their life when they saw the very first movie 30-40 years ago as a little kid... Just as Rogue One, this one is not a kids story. I really liked that there were no characters put into the movie which were obviously there to boost merchandise income. No obsolete story line like the ""casino trip"" in The Last Jedi. It is darker, more serious, people get hurt but at the same time it is still funny. I was concerned about Han not being Harrison Ford. Forget it. The character was played well and and it was how the person could have been at that specific age / phase. I also liked the reference to the SW books I read and the other SW story lines. Whether there should be movies about specific characters and should tell the stories like how Han won the Falcon instead of leaving it to the individuals imagination it is a topic for endless debate. Same applies to the related comic books, fan movies etc.... Anyway.... my recommendation is to go and watch the movie, enjoy the fast paced story line in the SW universe.

2362,Critically-Concerned,Suprisingly Good,8,24 May 2018,"After the generally great Force Awakens, excellent Rogue One but fundamentally flawed Last Jedi, my Star Wars enthusiasm was starting to dip, but Solo has at least partially restored my faith. When the Disney era was announced I was looking forward to the new trilogy, whilst Rogue One and Solo seemed like stories that didn't need to be told. Turns out I was completely wrong. Whilst TFA/TLJ are targeted at the mainstream audience (I'd argue to their detriment), the spin-off movies (despite their reported production problems) are turning out to be the ones where long-term fans can get the best Star Wars content. It's certainly not perfect and like Rogue One there's probably a couple too many references back to the originals. However, if you're experiencing Star Wars fatigue, I'd give it one more shot and you might be pleasantly surprised.

People are genuinely trying to dislike this movie for reasons beyond Star Wars. Don't let this deter you from having fun. They explore the lore quite a bit and don't go so deep to have it go over everyone's head, but still gives a faithful nod to canon lovers. The story overall has its moments of predictability, but balances it with some added depth and twists. Visually they capture environments/surroundings quite well, it feels genuine to the Star Wars galaxy. Clarke and Glover capture their roles brilliantly, in my opinion, setting ease to pre-production criticisms. Alden E might not entirely look the part of Han, but he captures his speech patterns and mannerisms surprisingly well with only a slight hiccup here or there; however that didn't break my suspenseion of disbelief. Harrelson delivers quite the performance as well, maybe even underrated as the attention goes to the younger actors. Capping this off the introduction to Han and Chewbacca's relationship was told quite well, they were able to make Chewie a relatable character with the same limited dialogue. Overall I'm glad they took the time to tell the tale, it doesn't take away from Han's ""cool factor"" by fleshing out his character.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

2368,adamjritchie,Is Han ruined? The High School Musical Version of Star Wars,2,25 May 2018,"SPOILER: You are here probably wondering if Han Solo got emasculated and ruined as a character even more. The answer is yes. His name now has a origin that is lamer than anything you could imagine. He is alone when he signs up for the Empire, says his name is Han so the Empire names him Han Solo. He gets bossed around most of the movie by women, there is a disturbing dong to dong shower scene with Han and Chewbacca (no I 'm not kidding). The new droid is a feminist from hell and the most annoying thing ever seen in Star Wars. Basically this is just another Kathleen Kennedy, Lucasfilm story group propaganda film where they strategically try to remove any masculinity form any male characters. All women in the movie are more masculine than Han. Oh and yes there is a Darth Maul cameo that has no resolution and i ridiculous and comical when he fired up a lightsaber for no reason. Enfys Nest is a 16 year old girl rebel who could take Bruce Lee as well. cus ""strong woman"" character. Avoid if you liked Star Wars.

2369,ammonaloha,Pleasantly surprised!,10,25 May 2018,"This movie was a solid origin story filled with action that presented a fresh spin on a beloved character. As a long term Star Wars nerd I had my worries that this would be another two hour ride into disappointment. But ultimately, I was pleasantly surprised. After the controversial departure of Phil Lord and Chris Miller, the retooling of the film took a safer approach under new direction from Ron Howard. And taking the safe route felt like he gave more respect to the original franchise, and the maker himself (George Lucas), with nods to the prequel trilogy and expanded universe lore. Those nods didn't feel too forced, like we'd seen in the continuation of the saga and Rogue One, but were simple mentions in the dialogue that kept us grounded in the universe we are familiar with. Filling the shoes of two iconic characters is not an easy ask, and I was grateful of the choices made by actors Alden Ehrenreich and Donald Glover to reinvent, whilst capturing the essence of the original Han Solo and Lando Calrissian. A blatant imitation would have felt lazy. Their take on the two well known characters felt organic and still retained the charisma we were expecting. It was also great to have Chewie return to the big screen, with Joonas Suotamo reprising his role - his presence felt wasted in The Last Jedi, so it was nice to have him in the forefront again. The introduction of new characters helped to flesh out this new story, though some could have done with a little more development as they fail to make their own mark in this oversaturated arena. Their significance only helps to drive the story following the title character, though gives them limited purpose. The deaths in the movie felt underwhelming because of this. I was impressed by Emilia Clarke's Qi'ra, with a performance that felt genuine and gave her character a slight veil of mystery (I'm curious to see how this unfolds in future Star Wars stories). Woody Harrelson and Paul Bettany were solid introductions to the franchise, and were guaranteed to provide great performances, which they did. And another notable addition was actress Phoebe Waller-Bridge, as the freshest droid in the galaxy, L3-37. K-2SO was my favourite part of Rogue One, and it appears that Lucasfilm has repeated this formula to great effect. A huge sore point in The Last Jedi was the irreverent and forced humour they used, likely to cater to the millenials. I was really glad they didn't take the same direction in Solo, where the humour was grounded within the context of the film, rather than threatening to break the fourth wall for some cheap laughs. That said however, there was a noticeable amount of sexual innuendo inserted throughout the film, but somehow felt genuine to their characters. With all the controversy documented throughout this films production I was looking forward to having lowered expectations, to be blown away during the screening. And this quite accurately happened. Star Wars is franchise close to me, and it feels like everyone is trying to re-invent the wheel and out-do each other in the new films, which is honestly great. But I do appreciate feeling safe with a familiar character and lore that has just enough new stuff to keep me excited and intrigued.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

2372,havefaith-70511,"Not Vital to the Franchise, But Solo Is a Blast!",8,25 May 2018,"You may have heard some mixed reactions from critics concerning Solo: A Star Wars Story. Some critics have slammed the film for its sluggish pacing, predictability, and being a lighter adventure film with less plot and character complexity than those of other Star Wars films. Perhaps some of these are true (to a degree), but Solo is a fun adventure any Star Wars fan should thoroughly enjoy. 
 The number one question most people will ask before seeing this film is naturally going to be, ""How does Alden Ehrenreich hold up in the role of Han Solo?"" He doesn't do an impersonation of Harrison Ford's version of the character, but he manages to pull off important aspects of Han Solo's character. Further into the movie, there are moments that he comes off as Han-esque but not necessarily Ford-esque, and that's not a bad thing! If you're concerned about the way he takes up the mantle of Han Solo in this film, he succeeds in playing a young, somewhat inexperienced Han Solo.
 The dynamics between the characters worked so well. The interactions between Han and Chewie were done particularly well and I loved the progression of their friendship throughout the film. Lando's introduction eased its way into the storyline well and I thought Donald Glover did a fantastic job in the role. I won't spoil anything here, but their intriguing friendship is built upon and makes sense when you recall their interactions in Empire Strikes Back. 
 The largest complaint I have is a moment at the end (which I won't spoil here). Something abrupt and almost out of place occurs and it took me out of the movie. When you watch it for yourselves, you'll probably understand what I'm talking about. Other than that, I very much enjoyed Solo: A Star Wars Story.

Solo, which came out today in my neck of the woods, feels like it was made of old bland ideas that have now been shot out into space with added CGI. It is an average film at best, but as a film in the Star Wars brand, it is well below expectation. Three words spring to mind. Could do Better.

The film was GREAT and a lot of fun!! Definitely felt the ""wester"" vibe but overall it still felt like a Star Wars movie. Alden Ehrenreich did a fantastic job as Han Solo. The first 15 minutes were a little strange because our brains are so used to Harrison Ford playing Solo but after a while I got used to Ehrenreich playing the role and found myself rooting for him by the end of the film. Excellent cast overall as well. Donald Glover epitomizes the swagger of a young Lando Calrissian and any scene with him and Solo is pure fun. The rest of the supporting cast (i.e. Emilia Clarke and Woody Harrelson) provide roles as new and interesting characters that ultimately help in developing Han Solo into the smuggler that we all love. Of course, Solo's fuzz ball side kick Chewbacca is always great and provided some comic relief to the film. Despite being a knowledgable fan of the franchise and obviously knowing that Chewbacca and Solo would not die in this film, I still felt the suspense and found myself on the edge of my seat at some point. There were some good laughs in the film but they certainly did not overdo it like TLJ. Definitely had a bit more of a serious tone but still light hearted at times. My only criticism is that some characters received early ""exits""; however, they had minor roles and I am sure Star Wars/Marvel is working on comics that explain their background. I am happy to hear that Ehrenreich signed for a couple more films and we will get to see more Solo in the future!",Solo - A Star Wars Story
2379,kylekreilly,Don't listen to the hate clowns,8,26 May 2018,"So half of the audience reviews are people who haven't seen the movie, but just ""think this will be trash"". Or are boycotting because of reason x,y,x. Haters are gonna hate because they hate every time a Star Wars movie isn't The Empire Strikes Back, clearly the best of the lot, A film which people forget was assaulted by critics when it came out, is now the unattainable height by which all Star Wars movies are unfairly measured. Is this movie that good? Of course not, no movie is that good and never will be. Accept this fact and stop depriving yourself of the possibility of enjoyment. My goodness. Do you need to check your expectations at the door? You might if you are expecting Empire or a life-changing moment in your life. If on the other hand you are a person who can appreciate the good in something without all this absolutism....""Its the best ever"" vs ""It destroyed star wars and my life forever""...and you can just go see a movie in a universe you love, with characters you want to see. Then you have a great treat in store for you. And that is not to take anything away from this film. It works exceptionally well more often than not. This movie isn't perfect, but it is a Star Wars movie to its core, probably more so than some of the new trilogy movies. I had so much fun at this movie. As I watched this movie I could feel my childhood self screaming with glee in my head while my adult self yipped with joy aloud. This movie succeeds in a lot of ways, most of them. For someone to say this movie is rotten is just laughable to me. The look of the movie alone is worth the price of admission. Fortunately you get so much more. This is the funniest Star Wars movie, but still a very action packed movie. I've heard some people say it had ""slow"" parts. I guess, but I think some of my favorite moments were just hanging out on the Falcon, shooting the breeze for a few minutes with these characters I love. The moments where i could just be allowed to float in this world without the story being crammed at me like sometimes it is in blockbuster movies, were wonderful. The beginning is a little rocky, but 15 mins in and it starts to find its footing. Halfway through the second act I felt like I was inside an expanded universe comic. It was really a fun time. I think this movie is going to age really well. It has some scenes in it which are the best of any SW movie, even the original trilogy. Don't listen to the haters. This is a quality adventure that was really needed. I haven't had this much fun in a movie in a long time. One of my favorites immediately and it expands the universe in great ways.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

2381,cookitdutch,Relax and enjoy it,7,26 May 2018,"I went not having high expectations after TLJ. This was a fun diversion that happened to be a SW movie. I will stand up for Alden- he pleasantly surprises. No he is not the same Solo that we know and love- because he is no Harrison Ford but he does Han justice in his own right, playing a younger, more boyish Han Solo that grows on the audience thoughout the movie. While the plot is somewhat predictable, it does explain why and how Han becomes the gruff and cynical older Solo we know and love. Cut him some slack- he can't transfigure himself into being HF but he did learn his carriage, body language, and mannerisms quite well without appearing to try too hard. I wouldn't have changed any of the decisions he made about the character once I accepted the fact that this was not- and never could be- Harrison Ford.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
2382,giraffegamer,What happened?,2,28 May 2018,"Okay, I am a huge Star Wars fan. I love the Star wars franchise, so you will get an honest review from me. Let's start it off!Okay, so Solo stole something that cost a lot of credits. He then goes to his love Qy'ra. Blah blah blah they kiss. Then they get captured and they are brought to a centipede like creature. Han used the sun to burn them. Then they ran, and made it to the check out zone. Once they got to the check out person, they offered her the thing that costs a lot of credits, she agreed but Han and Qy'ri knew that she would report them. So, Han escaped but Qy'ri didn't. Then Han joined the Imperial Army. And he got his name because he was alone. 3 YEARS LATER. 
Han Solo finds himself in a battlefield, struggling to survive. He had no idea what he was getting himself into. The Major, who died, said ""PUSH FORWARD!"" I think. Then Han Solo finds out the gang guys were there sneaking in. Blah blah blah. Han Solo wants to be recruited by Beckket, he disagreed and he turned Han in. Han Solo was cast into a cage where the beast was. Surprisingly the beast was Chewbacca. Blah blah blah they escaped with Beckket.NEXT CHAPTER!More crap love scenes. They rob the train, then the Nest arrives and kills the monkey and the other girl. Then they decided to tell Paul Bettany that they failed. When they arrived, Han found Qy'ri on board. She said she has changed, but she refused to tell Han that. Then Paul Bettany gave them another chance. Made Qy'ri to go with them. Next Chapter.Han Solo vs Lando. Lando won but they recruited Lando. Lando loves L3. They go to a mining thing which is hard to get to and they need a fast ship. Blah blah blah the droid wanted equal rights. Blah blah blah, they got the money. But the Falcon got beaten badly. Next Chapter.Lando leaves Han and Beckket. The nest arrives, and they reveal that the gang that Beckket works for is evil. Blah blah blah, Beckket leaves. Han Solo goes up to Paul Bettany and gives him the glowey stuff. Paul knew he was getting tricked. Beckket arrived and betrayed Han. Then Paul's men surrounded the Nest. Blah blah blah... Han Solo outsmarted beckket and it really was the glowey stuff. And the nest ambushed Paul's men. Then a fight scene. Paul dies. NEXT CHAPTER!Han kills Beckket. Blah blah blah... Qy'ra contacts Darth Maul which was awesome. I hope Maul cuts her in half. Blah blah blah, Han meets Lando again and he won the Falcon. The End.
Overall, it was a horrible movie. I would've given it a 4/10 if Maul wasn't in there. But overall, a horrible movie I would not advise to see it unless you want to see Darth Maul which he has like a 30 second scene.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

2384,benjaminsamuelthomas,I created an account to write this review,9,26 May 2018,"****This review is spoiler heavy****Another Star Wars story wins my heart over. I have to admit, I hated The Last Jedi, and when I saw the reviews for Solo I was left with little hope. I'm happy to say that I was hardly disappointed. The actors work, the plot is way more enjoyable than The Last Jedi, the visuals are stunning, and it feels like a true story straight out of Star Wars lore.Solo brings an entertaining backstory to a beloved character, developing his story to an extent that no one anticipated. Who would have thought that Han got his name as a result of being completely alone? Or that he, in fact, started the rebellion? What about the detail that The Imperial March actually exists within the Star Wars universe?And then there's the Darth Maul appearance. Not only was Maul's return to the big screen a huge surprise, but it was something that felt right. Many Star Wars fans are probably unaware of the fact that Maul survived his battle with Obi-Wan on Naboo and was saved by his brother Savage Opress. The fact that he goes on to become the head of a crime syndicate is so incredibly fitting for the character and his cameo opens the opportunity for a reappearance in a future movie.The contributions that Solo make to the Star Wars lore don't end there. One of the best moments is when the audience learns that Han probably did indeed shoot first, settling a fan debate that had probably been raging for a little too long. Not only is this a great revelation, but it is one that makes sense for Han's character---it fits the person he is.My only complaint is that Dryden Vos wasn't the most intimidating villain, but the fact that Maul is truly the one calling shots makes up for that. I did, however, think that his lightsaber ignition was unnecessary. There should have been at least one Star Wars movie without a single light saber. It was just a cheesy attempt to remind people who that character was, in case anyone forgot.Despite those things, I can conclude by saying that Solo made a number of great contributions to the Star Wars lore while also bringing viewers through an entertaining and action-packed adventure. I definitely recommend this movie to anyone who is a fan of the Star Wars series.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

2386,michaelibarcena,This was AMAZING and true to Star Wars!,10,26 May 2018,"I thought that Ron Howard did an excellent job with adaptation of Han Solo. Walking into this movie I left all expectations at the door. From the opening credits to Han's first action scene I thought that this was perfect! This film provides answers and new questions to the ever expanding Star Wars universe. Did Darth Maul even die? Where those robotic legs? Thinking about it still gives me goosebumps! Could these new characters shed some light on who exactly is Reys mother or birth line? And Chewy, let's not forget him!

There's not one episode that I dislike and like everyone on the planet, we all have our favorites when it comes to a franchise as big as Star Wars. It strikes me as funny, that some fans believe that Disney and all involved are only doing it for the money, (especially coming from those that disliked or hated Solo) what franchise doesn't make movies for money? Name just one.
 Without mentioning any spoilers at all, Solo had everything in the film that I expected to see. The scenes with Chewbacca were brilliant and I don't care what anyone says, but Alden and Donald were chosen well for their parts. For me personally, whether you hated or loved Rogue One, Solo had the same feel. I'd watch this movie again and again.

2392,levirknight,Great Movie GO See,10,27 May 2018,"As a big Star Wars fan I really enjoyed this stand alone film starring Alden Ehrenreich (Han Solo). I think it was the perfect balance of plot, action, and CGI. There were a few easter eggs you can spot during the film, such as R2, and Boba Fett which will work well with the Boba Fett stand alone we were promised by Disney. I've been reading some reviews and a lot of people say that they hate and that it is one of the worst Star Wars films out there. I strongly disagree with that. People have been wanting to get their hand on a back story of Han Solo for a while and with out this movie we would not know how Han and Chewie met or how he even became a smuggler. When I was in the theatre watching this on opening day I did not have high hopes after watching the trailer, but once I was in there and immersed in the wonderful world of Star Wars I actually really loved this movie and it is definitely one of my all time favorite movies of the whole Star Wars franchise.My friend who went to see it with me said that it was one of his top 5 favorite movies of all time (He has never seen another Star Wars film besides Rogue One and another that I can not remember.). I think it is way better than the other big hitter this year Infinity War. Solo just had a better feel to it, and I think thats something that even marvel can't compete with. It really helped me get back to loving Star Wars after the Last Jedi (one of the worst Star Wars films). No let me talk about that one scene where Darth Maul is revealed to be the leader of Crimson Dawn. (we all knew that Maul had survived thanks to Rebels and the Clone Wars, which are canon) Who new he would end up being a ""Crime lord"". I think it will be very interesting where Disney takes this.

2395,justicedispencer,Just sort your socks instead,1,26 May 2018,"I can't say that Solo is a bad movie, because it's not really a movie at all. It's a mess of action scenes glued together by all the adventure movie cliches the director was able to find. 
It's the first time in my life when I was so bored watching a Star Wars movie that I actually wanted to leave half-way through it. Honestly, this one is waaaay worse than even the Attack of the Clones-I guess it's an achievement in itself :)
I've seen that people praise it for being true to the lore, but actually they've just took a couple of facts from the original trilogy and stapled their script (though I doubt they even had one) to it.
The cast is absolutely ininspiring and talentless. The main guy (I refuse to call him Han) and the Mother of Dragons had about four facial expressions between them in the entire movie. I felt such a pain watching Woody Harrelson and Paul Bettany, who are great actors, dragging along in this mess for 2 hours.

2397,rantcentral,The dark side..,2,26 May 2018,"Spoilers come at end of review. I'll provide a warning.Solo: A Star Wars Story is a movie I will see time and time again. You might be asking yourself, why did I rate it 2 stars if I'll watch it again? The answer- it is still a Star Wars movie.This movie felt like a cheap, poorly made fan film, directed by someone who doesn't even know the Star Wars storyline. They ruined the origin of Han and Chewbacca's partnership, and spent way too much time on the smallest scenes (more detail in the spoiler section). If you're a hardcore Star Wars fan, you owe it to yourself to see this movie, but if you're just someone who wants to see a movie, save yourself $12-18-------SPOILERS AHEAD-----
 You have been warned.
There is absolutely no reason Darth Maul should've been in this film. It felt like a cheap excuse to make people say ""oh, wow. A character we didn't see enough of"" even though if you've seen Rebels, you know his ultimate fate. We've seen him in Episode I, TCW, and Rebels. We know his fate, we know his story, we don't need him in this movie. Since the entire movie focused on smuggling, and a few mentions of Jabba, Boba Fett would've been a much better fit for the scene, or better yet instead of having Qi'ra talk to him, have it be a flashback to a much younger Beckett with Maul, on Naboo, having the film end with Maul saying something such as ""wait here boy"" then walking out, having the double doors open, duel of the fates starts playing, Maul takes his hood off, close up on yellow eyes, cut to black.Now that is if Maul HAD to be in the film, I would much rather have it end as follows-Han and Chewie land on Tatooine, the walk into the cantina. Simple, right? No Maul, nothing else but a way for the film to end right as episode IV starts.Also, I might want to add that this movie is 10 years before Episode IV, as Chewbacca is 200 in that film, and he is 190 years old in this one. The movie ends with Han and Chewie going to Tatooine because of a new job, if they go, and end up in the cantina offscreen, that means Ron Howard didn't pay attention to detail, or Han and Chewie were either on Tatooine for 10 years, or they just happened to be there again when Luke finds them. Either way, poor ending.Let's talk about Dryden Vos. Who is he? Who cares. He's a pointless character, introduced because we need a villain. Okay, then what about Enfys Nest? She is barely in the movie, and when she is, she's pointless. She's not even a villain like the trailers make you believe. L3 was very boring, and her humor sucked, enough said.The writing for both Han and Lando was terrible, and didn't stay true to the original characters at all.All in all, this movie sucked, and I wouldn't trust Ron Howard with another movie, but I am still a SW fan, so I will most likely watch is at LEAST 100 more times in my lifetime",Solo - A Star Wars Story

I then began waiting for an epic light sabre battle or for an extended scene with Maul when Qi'ra took off on the ship, but the film abruptly ended and I left without any form of satisfaction. Other than the few epic battle scenes, like the train scene, the film falls flat. No character development, no in-depth understanding of anyones motivations or history.

Black or white, you are more racist than me if you think there is such a thing as black and white, scientifically. Soooooooo.... Let the sarcasm begin!
*Que Sarcasm* FINALLY, the film we all asked for! Alden Hitlereich is a perfect Solo! he proved his acting chops by nailing a role as a terrible actor who needed an acting coach in a Coen Brothers film, which was in no way ironic! Sure he looks the same age as Ford in A New Hope, that in NO way makes it creepy seeing a grown man acting like a little kid and thinking we buy it! Solo would definitely say things like ""I'm gonna be the bestest star pilot in the galaxy one day! Yippeee"" THat is an actual line. But wait, wasn't that Luke? No! But wasn't Ford a jaded, smug, jerk who still just oozed coolness, who was probably more like ford's younger character in American graffitti when he was younger, who was a smug jerk who still just oozed coolness? No! He was a widdle bitty kitty who acted like an insecure wreck, who a movie studio would have to pay a girl to be interested in! His love scenes with Kira, excuse me, Quieierahhhhh (the h is silent, kewl!) in no way resembles a porno IE where a super uncomfortable bad actress is paid to push herself onto a total creep! In NO way! Its totally-Brf-believable-Bffft-chemistr-MBFFTT- excuse me, had to hold down a little vomit! Donald Glover is totally Lando! Not a goofy nerd from Community doing an impression of Lando! He is totally different than his role in Community, totally unrecognizable, a real Daniel Day-Lewis! Lando definitely had goofy giant teeth and soft hands as a kid Billy Dee would agree! The coolest chauvenist in the galaxy who made Leia super uncomfortable by being unable to stop hitting on her definitely spent his early days so dedicated to equality that he had a droid sidekick with Tilda Swinton's voice and treated him and everyone around her like she was their mother, that was SO Lando! He definitely did NOT get that role by going on a bunch of rants on twitter about how racist Hollywood is for not letting him play Spiderman when he looked like a 40 year old man! I mean, Cmon, Twitter such a classy place, and the perfect platform for social injustices, In no way like reading the writings of psychos on bathroom stalls #MAGA! These people in NO way resemble nerdy little fans playing dress up of their favorite characters in their favorite movies! Proof: Budget. And I'm so glad they came up with a good excuse for why Han was called Han SOLO, without it that name would be too on the nose for a guy who was always SOLO, not counting his wookie partner who was standing literally right next to him at all times! And where he got his iconic blaster, Kewl! And how he met Chewie, Kewl! and how the Falcon got it's shape,didn't know that was a quesntion capable of being asked, double Kewl! I'm so glad Kennedy followed in Rian Johnson's direction: that what's so much easier than finding interesting lessons and concepts by STUDYING history, ancient eastern religions such as Taoism, and concepts of good and evil, or the unseen atomic energy that connects us all, and putting them into SUCH boooring scenes like the Yoda training scenes in Empire, the boringest SW film, is just thinking whatever random opinions you have about such topics are equally valid!

Trained to fly spaceships by the very oppressors he hates, Han spots his chance to break free again when me meets a kindered soul, becomes a bandit and is thrown into the murky, mafia universe of power source traders and thieves.
This film delivers on every level, fast paced, refective and formative, but eventually Ron Howard's pulls off a superb ending scene where we never know if Han's oft failed schemes will finally bear fruit.

There isn't in every corner light-saber and jedi power. The SW universe is so large, I don't really understand why they make almost all the time movies about the self-repeating, uninventive main story. They say that jedis and siths are rear, but I felt in the last movies, that in a normal little town there must be in every street at least two of both.I hope this is the beginning of a lot of movies, which show us other aspects of this universe. I don't miss mages flailing with light-sabers. Yes, they are part of the world, but they were too much for me.This movie is a fresh new start for me. After the original trilogy this is my favorite before Rogue One :) And before all the other illogical, silly, repetitive, story-less things I really disliked (The Last Jedi, The Force Awakens).And I liked most of the characters. Alden Ehrenreich felt ok, if he would be the first Han Solo I met, I would say he is very good. And you know what, he is really good, I didn't expected a Harison Ford clone. Woody Harrelson (Beckett) was great, and Donald Glover was ok. I like Emilia Clarke, she is one of my favorite character in GoT, but here she was a bit disappointment, she was shallow, I felt her out of the role.Maybe my 10 is a bit much, but I hope that this is a good beginning of a new type of SW movies.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
2405,julian_kinghorn,"The force is so weak in this film it truly represents ""The Grey Side""",5,27 May 2018,"I watched ""Solo"" at the London BFI IMAX, in 3D. This generally allows a movie an advantage, but not ""Solo"". 
The scripting felt as though a large group of writers had agreed to water down what should have been the best Star Wars origin storyline available.
It reminded me of a stupid way of reading a book, only a small part of each chapter. The real meat on the bone in this story has been removed. 
I expected some real humour, classic Han and Chewie banter. Even their first meeting was a let down.
As I sat watching my hopes disappear, I thought about JJ Abrams reworking of Star Trek. I had never really enjoyed previous Star Trek TV or films, but seeing Kirk come to life, as an origin story, was wonderful. Solo is so far from that it is embarrassing. 
I thought ""The Last Jedi"" was a new low point in the series, sadly I was wrong.
A wasted opportunity, it wanders rather than travels and offers nothing surprising, other than a consistently striking sense of what Disney believe Star Wars fans would enjoy. Disney, you've got it wrong, again.

I secretly love young Han a lot more than grumpy old Han. Loved the chemistry and backstory with Qi'ra, was so heartbreaking. Action sequences and cinematography were brilliant.

2410,gustavhedenborg,This is better than both Episode 7 & 8,8,1 June 2018,"I liked Episode 7 because Harrison Ford was in there to control the movie. 
I accepted Episode 8 but in the end I feel it doesn't have an engaging story anymore and I'm not looking forward to Episode 9 as much as I would have liked.I do however support the new side stories that Disney have made with Rogue One and Solo. You are introduced to new characters in these movies and their stories are often new and fresh despite that they are tied to the originals.Solo takes off as an Indiana Jones adventure and I think Edenreich does a good job as Solo. I can see him getting Indy too after this. It's not that he is the best actor or that he looks like Harrison Ford but he makes the part his own and it is convincing enough for me. Harrison is my all time favorite actor and nothing can change that, but I like what I saw. I saw someone who takes on the role with confidence just like Han Solo and Indiana Jones would take on a new adventure and I like that attitude from Alden. In this movie you get some good dialogue and character development as opposed to The Last Jedi. It's slow and communicative when it needs to and goes to action at a good pace. The chemistry between Qira and Han is good and you ask yourself some questions about their relationship.Relationships are the big thing in the side stories of Star Wars and I appreciate that.

I will agree that it is not the ""traditional"" Star Wars movie - no real good vs. evil, no Jedi-Sith struggle - but honestly, I was ready for something different. I love the SW universe (have EVERY book in the EU and read them all) and was pleasantly surprised at what they incorporated here from those books and games - Sharu, the Maw, Teras Kasi, etc. The script and story line were not perfect, but again, if you watch the original trilogy again with fresh eyes, the dialogue there is campy and the movie flow is not the best either. This movie is not one of my favorite SW movies, but it is WAY better than Attack of the Clones (shiver...) and the rest of the prequels, as well as TLJ in my opinion.

I was definitely hesitant about how any cast could own this story but they did. Speaking of the story (no spoilers), it works well and then really comes together right at the end - realistically setting up 2 more Alden Ehrenreich movies. Ehrenreich has taken the Solo mantel from Harrison Ford - Ehrenreich *is* the young Solo. I call this out because that was the #1 issue I had with this movie coming into it. No one else could be play Solo - but Ehrenreich won me over. The rest of the cast was excellent and I am looking forward to seeing the majority of them again in the future.

Simple thing, you have a mission? You deliver it. (I still can't believe how TLJ split scenes into 3 parts of mission and they all fail, kay going back without luke, finn bring back a traitor, and poe with that run off mission). For this one thing, when you actually watch solo you'll get the adventure you need. The mission is clear, the execution is there. If you see this movie with clear objective minds, without doing this while picturing harrison ford in your head you'll be okay with ehreinrich. For me personally if you really respect solo character you will get that heartwarming moments of throwback in this movie, they have they own plot but they didn't forget to deliver some details that makes us remembering the old han solo. This is why I told you this movie is good, this is not harrison ford han solo but the more I watch it the more I remember that old han solo, and that is a great way to respect a character. So for those who haven't watched it, watch it without hoping that this han solo will be 100% like Harrison ford (like wth, who will ever gonna be like him anyway?

And i was not disapointed. Of course they had to replace Harrison Ford, but the choice of Alden was disastrous. Thats Point 1.
Point 2: The story is thin... very thin. The legendary Kessel Run seems to be a very dangerous 20 min flight... with a kraken. Wow!
Point 3: I have no words for L3-37. Even Jar Jar would have been better than this.
Point 4: Even if every ""rebels"" fan will disagree with me: Lando as a charming smuggler was completely destroyed in this movie. Not by Glover (he even did a good job) but by the writers. Now he is a robotophile playboy who wears Hawaii-Shirts
Point 5: So Han became the best pilot of the universe, just by stepping into the cockpit? Same with his blaster-skills... Are they just...there?
The even most important Point 6: There was not a single Star Wars Moment. No goosebumps, no ""a-ha', no laughter. ""Solo"" might a well play in the Marvel universe or no particular universe at all.

The beginning was VERY fast paced and spontaneous, it felt like it went to quickly and used up interesting characters. It would have made more sense if they slowed the pace down slightly, everything happened so quickly in the very beginning it left me feeling a little confused. HOWEVER The movie did slow down a bit and was really entertaining. Solo is shown as he is in the original series (but younger) the actor did very well, as he was faced with walking in the shoes of Harrison Ford, he did a very good job at bringing Han's arrogant street-smart (space smart?) personality to the screen.My favorite scenes included how he met Chewy, their relationship and bonding as well as how Han gained his ship. The film was sprinkled with Easter eggs that are absolutely awesome, I'm definitely going to rewatch this movie so I can look for more Easter eggs. Though the beginning felt somewhat crazy and rushed, the film was captivating, and of course filled with Han's witty lines and jokes. The characters were interesting and well-played, however, Han's love interest was very confusing. There were moments when she seemed to be evil but then also good.Runtime- 2 hours 15 minuets

I think the low sales is primarily due to how horribly bad the Last Jedi was... many gave up on the franchise after that. If Last Jedi was on the same level as Force Awakens, I think people would have rushed to view Solo. The actor was excellent as Solo, the plot was solidly interesting, and the gritty (grey) feel & cinematography added to the nature of Solo's persona.

2430,RGDavis2018,Solo - Entertaining Star Wars Movie Definitely Worth Seeing!,9,29 May 2018,"Solo is an entertaining look back at Han Solo's early years, and considering the film's production troubles, it is way more fun than you might expect! Director Ron Howard deserves a lot of credit for stepping into the troubled production and giving us Solo, which is a fun combination of western, war, heist, and film noir genres. Credit also goes to the Kasdans for their script which not only fills in Han Solo's history (How did Han meet Chewbacca? Did he really win the Falcon from Lando fair and square?), but it deftly connects the Original Trilogy of Star Wars films to the Prequel Trilogy and the new Sequel Trilogy. Lots of fun easter eggs for the Star Wars fans (Han's dice, Weazel, a cameo from a villain we won't spoil here, a definite answer to who shoots first), Solo can also be enjoyed by the Star Wars novice as an entertaining adventure. Alden and Donald do a good job showing us the younger versions of their iconic characters, and Emilia, Woody, Thandie and Paul give great support. Joonas also does an excellent job taking over as Chewy from Peter Mayhew. Although Disney probably should have released Solo later in the year considering that The Last Jedi was released just last Christmas, Solo deserves to find an audience. I would really like to see further adventures with young Han, Chewy, Lando and Qi'ra!",Solo - A Star Wars Story

Considering all the average reviews, I was surprised after walking out of the theater, I thought it was right up there (or better than) Sith. The plot is wildly entertaining and 'tosses the coaxium football' around at a furious pace. The new characters are very convincing, i.e. they don't come across as future happy meal toys (like the other movies). Sure, there are repetitive re-hashed themes and plots, but this is expected, given the original trilogy. I also appreciate that the special effects aren't Michael Bay unbelievable.The only thing I didn't like about this movie was Alden Ehrenreich. He was OK but clearly lacked the stage presence that Harrison Ford had. And you are reminded of this IN EVERY SCENE HE DOES WITH WOODY HARRELSON, who is superb, superb, SUPERB!

People don't have to like movies, but lying about them is bad form.""Solo"" is not a deep, philosophical Star Wars film. It's not a grandiose Star Wars film. Han Solo's world is small and self-centered, but only because he chose to keep it that way until he reluctantly accepted a job shuttleing a couple dudes and droids across the galaxy. What we were treated to was the first adventure of a young man, not unlike the naive farming from Tatooine, but with TONS more Chewie and less Skywalker whining. It is a well thoughtout story that shows the first steps towards our favorite smugglers destiny but also brings new layers of gravitas to the decisions he makes later down the timeline. ""Solo"" echoes all the fun and excitement one would feel watching A New Hope as a kid again. The performers are fresh but the characters are in good hands.

2440,tomtannerhaus,Much better than its opening weekend,9,30 May 2018,"After seeing the negative hype about the opening weekend, and a few mediocre reviews, I thought I'd chime in and offer a more positive perspective. First of all, people who are comparing Solo to Rogue One are making a comparison of two very different kinds of movie. Rogue One is a story of intrigue and tragedy that functions as a segue to A New Hope. Solo is a rollicking buddy/action flick, and its only real segue is to imagining what crazy misfortune awaits Han as he goes off to Tatooine. In some ways, I'd compare Solo to the Clone Wars cartoon series. It's pretty light-hearted, on-the-nose, and knows it's a small part of a bigger universe. It doesn't try to over-explain everything that gets introduced.As far as pacing and character, it's very much a Ron Howard movie. He has a knack for taking characters that would likely be terribly annoying in real life, and turning them into sympathetic characters you can enjoy. I feel like plenty of directors could have made Han a terribly unlikable trickster, but Howard makes Han a decent (though misguided) human being. The tone of the movie is pretty light. Meaning: if someone you like perishes, you're not going to feel like breaking down into a fit of sobbing. Or you're not going to feel like that's what the director was trying to do to you-especially painful when they're unsuccessful and just make you want to cringe. Howard steers clear of these landmines. Characters may get upset, but you're an observer rather than a participant.Some scenes are exciting and striking, and deserve to be seen, like some images from the crazy Kessel Run. I didn't think anyone could convince me to take them seriously as Han Solo. Harrison Ford will forever be Han and Indy simultaneously in my mind. However, the lead here does a very good job-and bears enough resemblance to Ford to make it work. (Contrast this with the jarring differences between Obi Wan of the prequels/sequels-it's nothing like that.)I hope people will go see the film for themselves. It deserves to be famous for more than just ""a sleepy first week box office,"" etc. It deserves to be seen and entered into the collection of great Star Wars stories!",Solo - A Star Wars Story
2441,soccerkeeperoo,Unjustly criticized,8,23 November 2018,"Overall I think it was a good solid entry in the Star Wars mythology. Definitely deserves a sequel! I thought Ron Howard captured the essence of Han and Chewbacca. I felt that Lando was just thrown in so the Falcon could be given to Han. I understand the critics, but these movies are supposed to be entertaining and they are. No they are not going to win best actor oscars. Everyone needs to just get lost in the movie like this one is made to do. I enjoyed this movie and would very much like to see a sequel and a whole story for Solo!",Solo - A Star Wars Story
2442,ryanreeves-40158,Wonderful Suspense Action Thriller!,10,30 May 2018,"I was 6 in 1977 when I first saw Star Wars. For me, my hero has always been Han Solo. For me, this was the best way to launch a feature film focused on a legacy character. The events of the young solo, help us understand his decisions that he will make from SW to TFA, and even predict them. The overall pacing of the movie was fantastic and very reminiscing of Raiders of the Lost Arc. At no point in time, did any of the actors take me out of the character that I have lived with for my entire life! (spoiler)
Additionally, I have become a big fan of Dave Filoni's work, while I look at The Clone Wars as surpassing most of the live action films in depth of story telling, character development, world development and an immersive Star Wars experience. I loved how the live action footage added to Maul's arc after the War of Mandalore and the affiliation with the crime syndicates. This cameo left a big smile on my face!

Han Solo is a Huge part of my childhood, and so my wife gave me comfort, when she said to go in with an open mind. I did. I was thoroughly entertained. I loved the story between Han and Chewy. I loved everything about it. Yes, there are many cliches, but it's Star Wars. Star Wars is super cheesy, let's not sugar coat it. The only real serious character was Vader. About ten minutes in I realized Han in this movie is just a kid, so the resemblance was enough for me. I know others have issue that it's not Ford but Alden did a great job. Only thing I can say that maybe I didn't like was L3 the droid, I think it was little overreaching with that character.

I was wrong. This movie was pure Star Wars from start to finish. We saw all the action, adventure, and excitement that made us all love the Original Trilogy. Ehrenreich's portrayal of Han is incredible and true to the original character. Glover, Clarke, Harrelson and the rest of the supporting cast are equally fantastic in their roles. The plot and characters were the most compelling of the Disney era, and I left the theater wanting more. Subtle nods and Easter Eggs are in the movie for those who have watched the Clone Wars and Rebels TV shows, and there is plenty of foreshadowing of Han's future in the Original Trilogy.

My favourite character is by far Lando and I feel Donald Glover made a fantastic job of portraying the character. Following this, I know there has been some backlash of Alderns performance as Han and how it doesn't really feel close to Harrison Fords performance. However I do feel in the final act and some of the second his performance improves and we actually see a hint of Solo.Moving on from this i think Emilia Clarke and Woody Harrelsons performances along with Paul Bettanys roles add to the film and makes it more interesting. Overall, the performances and the action and in space flight scenes make for a exiting film to watch and will make sure both fans of the franchise aswell as new comers or casual cinema goers to have an enjoyable experience. Which is why I have given it a 7/10.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
2453,brandonsosnick,Better than TLJ and TFA. Not quite as good as Rogue one,7,1 June 2018,"Solo was a fairly middle of the pack Star Wars film, but it clearly wasn't that bad. In fact, it was hell of a lot better than the last two films, which were both a complete joke if i might add... I mean, even EP2 and EP3 were better than TLJ and TFA. Anyways, Solo takes some of the sheer action & grittiness of Rogue One and meshes it with a drama driven story arc reminiscent of Revenge of the Sith. Overall, beautiful cinematography on the part of Ron Howard. Anyone who genuinely believed that Solo was worse than the likes of TLJ and TFA is complete idiot. Although, I am pretty sure that half of these 1 to 2 star reviews are purely for trolling purposes. Virgins, gotta love em.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
2454,turboyuya,Thumbs Up .. Enjoy it!,10,1 June 2018,"-It is my opinion-
Ron Howard did a marvellous job with Solo: A Star Wars Story. I do hope they use his collective talents in the future for another Star Wars film. And I most certainly hope in that event we will see Tom hanks gets his wish to make a guest appearance in the next one. After all, he and Ron Howard did share screen time in an episode of 'Happy Days'.Now in respect to the cast & crew, for Solo: A Star Wars Story. They all seemed to be having fun & enjoyed making this movie, so why not you enjoy it too?. All of them performed brilliantly, with each bearing a crucial substance and presence that aided wonderfully in the storytelling and collaboration with each other. The end result is a quality delivered production that was both engaging and entertaining. It is my opinion that this movie is well worth a watch and is a great addition to the Star Wars Story.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

2456,viktoriamagrey,"Oh, boy.",4,1 June 2018,"To be honest, I wasn't very excited to begin with. It has a plot that's sort of there, it's not too bad, but it kept jumping around from here to there with constant action scenes that sadly are probably the highlight of the movie. Characters come, say a few lines and die before you can give a damn about them and most of the time are blatantly there to hold their place until they hit the bucket in a few minutes and make room for Han himself, whose performance is, to put it gently, not very enjoyable. He's got this girl he's in love with, and apparently there's something going on but there's very little chemistry, and the ""bad acts"" she's said to have comitted are completely glossed over but brought up again and again until the end of the movie without us really getting much explanation as to what they were. I know not everything is supposed to be answered, but this movie has a knack for not knowing what is supposed to be answered and what isn't. Even some of the death scenes for the characters are overplayed and sometimes last longer than they should just so they can say a final line that's supposed to be shocking or emotional but really didn't hit home for me. Coming to think of it the dialogue is passable, but some lines really stand out for being pretty awful, and a lot of the things almost feel like they're being said just to move things along as opposed to happening naturally. I was able to guess a lot of the predictable lines before they were said. I wanted to find some enjoyment in this film, and I did. The loud noises, blasters, and visual effects certainly kept me and my friend from sleeping in the theater, Lando was surprisingly charismatic in comparision to Solo over there. But asides from that, even the score for the movie seems kind of unfitting because it's more competent than the movie itself.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

It kept my attention, which is not easy to do. I grew up loving Star Wars and always wondered about how Han Solo and Chewbacca met. The actor portraying Han Solo was good and had great comedic timing. His presence was not as strong as Harrison Ford's, which is why I feel this movie is getting a lower rating. Yes, Harrison Ford is appealing on screen, handsome, charismatic, and funny. However, this actor was pretty good as a young Solo and I think that if you are a true Star Wars fan, you will enjoy this film and allow it to take you on an adventure.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

Those first 15min were shot in the shaky hand held camera style which was annoying, also there were some very abrupt scene cuts. which i'm guessing was due to diff directors.this movie should have been given to Ron Howard from day one and it wold have been an absolute smash hit. unfortunately we have Kathleen Kennedy in control making all sort of blunders.
but it is still a very enjoyable movie and for once it does justice to the feel of original characters.

Thought it felt the most correlated to the original trilogy of any of the subsequent pre quel/sequels. Very good film and I would like to see more of this.

2473,nomolos-57038,Fun action adventure,8,11 June 2018,"Solo is a fun and exciting action adventure movie. Unfortunately it's yet another victim of salty StarWars fans who feel ""their"" cinematic movieverse has fallen under assault again. It's really a shame because Solo is a fun StarWars movie that doesn't ""break"" any canon and just tries to have a good time.
On that front it succeeds. It's action is entertaining and doesn't rely on the acrobatic Jedi action like the main movies to thrill. This has chases, shoot outs, and a good amount of Wookie to keep your eyes glued to the screen.
The plot is straight forward; steal the loot get the girl which maybe simple but this movie isn't trying to be Shakespeare it's a pulp Saturday serial movie just like the ones George Lucas used as inspiration. The story is self contained but lays tracks for further adventures.
A lot has been made of the actors portrayal of Solo. Honestly it's nowhere as bad as they say. He won't be getting any award nods for it either but he's honest and endearing showing us a younger more idealistic Solo than who we meet in a seedy bar on Tatooine years later. Lando channels strong the vibe Billy Dee brought to the character which may actually be a negative as you sometimes feel you're watching Donald Glover play Billy Dee Williams play Lando. Despite that he does it so effortlessly and stands out in every scene he's in. 
Woody Harelson and Paul Bettany are serviceable in roles that don't stress their acting chops but they don't phone it in either. 
Emilia Clark and Thandie Newton both play strong female character that feel like they both led the same path in life and had to make a the same choice for love. They both made a different one ands it's interesting to see that affect play out.
As is often with a StarWars movie the nonhuman characters are often the ones that shine the brightest. Solo continues that trend with classic Chewbacca and new comer L3. Of the two L3 makes the biggest impact with her revolutionary ideals and surprising importance to the story and beyond. It's a blast to see Chewbacca fight and it makes you realize why Wookiees are both admired and feared for their strength.
There's plenty here for a casual StarWars fan but even those of us watching them since we were kids in the 80s get plenty of nostalgia moments to satisfy our inner child. Which is why I find the vitriol against the movie so surprising. I can understand the Last Jedi upsetting fans as it purposefully tried to defy expectations and assumptions. Solo instead lets us see moments we all know happened play out. The meeting of Han, Chewie,and Lando, the infamous Kessel Run, and the legendary game where Han won the Falcon. This are not epic watershed moments of cinema but they're fun and make sense. I really don't know how any fan can't get a kick seeing Han and Chewie sit down side by side for the first time in the Falcon's cockpit.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

Because nobody hates Star Wars more than fans, and the reviews of this movie - and frankly, the last two as well - illustrate that with clarity, and what do Star Wars fans hate more than Star Wars? Disney.Let me play Devil's Advocate here. There ARE no good Star Wars movies. There I said what every non-rabid fan is thinking.Any Star Wars movie you think is good in the global scheme of things is only good because of your sense of nostalgia, or the fact that you simply don'd know what a good movie is. They're cheeseball. The acting is average at best, and George Lucas and Lucasfilm haven't done anything vaguely cutting edge since the 1970's. The prequel Episodes 1-3 are almost unwatchably bad, I will argue, because George Lucas was writer, director and producer,. There's Jar-Jar Binks. There's Hayden Christensen and Natalie Portman's ridiculous relationship. Ewan McGregors' cringeworthy Alec Guinness impersonation. The list is long. VERY long.So I think they healthy thing to do with the Star Wars franchise, is just to take a reality pill before seeing them, expecting them to be average and hoping for the best. Solo is EXACTLY one of those films. Awesome effects, vehicles, and it adds something to the backstory, but overall? Yeah, a typically average film, but one that is an entertaining and a non-challenging night out at the movies.Just like pretty much every other Star Wars movie.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

Excellent sound and visuals.Now I will tell you this, it has its flaws. 
Making Lando a pan sexual is just not needed what so ever.

Lando's connection with his droid showed a side of the too cool dude that hasn't been seen before.A, shall we say, sensitive side. A reference to missing his mom maybe? The scene where Chewy and Han meet was a good idea and shows the gratitude and loyalty towards Han that is seen in later episodes. Han is played pretty well I'm glad Ehren didn't just try and do an impression of Harrison Ford because that would have been annoying. Good chase scenes, the race through the Maehlstorm I think was my favorite part and Han's love interest situation leaves open another meeting of the two possible later.

2493,craigmeadors,"Good action movie, too many well known actors, ok for the Star Wars canon",8,27 June 2018,"Finally went to see it, as I held back after the rough reviews and wanted a quiet audience. A good Star Wars movie overall, but definitely the weakest. Lots of spoilers here.Firstly, any prequel that is too religious to the long term story drains the suspense out of the script and movie watching. ADD some NEW stuff or twists that surprises us. Examples; cargo steal scenes we know the main characters won't die, Kessel Run completion, the multiple card games with Lando where we know the eventual outcome, multiple Han-at-risk death scenes. You could have done MANY movies to cover those bases. Part of the goodness of the last few Star Wars films before this one were the big surprises, or twists on the history (recall that history is written depending on the person's perspective...).Secondly, go back to less is more with the big acting names. One of the big benefits of the other stories were the relative unknowns of most actors. I could not help but think of Thandie as Maeve in Westworld, Bettany as Vision in Marvel universe, Woody etc. Distracting the audience with faces we recognize from other big stories does not help. Props for surprisingly killing off Thandie early. I'm personally SICK of the Clint Howard pop-ups in Ron's movies. Yes - I get that it is his shtick and trademark. But it has NO BUSINESS being in a Star Wars or other long-well-known series - especially after Ron was added as the final Director. Someone should have edited back his instinct on this (and please take it out of the DVD!!!!). Pay Clint for not showing up in a Ron film.Thought the actors (sans Clint) did a very good job overall, and I did not recognize some of the ""hidden"" voices that were in the credits. Alden, Donald, and Emilia should all be given another shot in future Star Wars films.Great action sequences, and some cleverness in the staging and physics of how it all tied together.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
2494,kachina_nicole,"A fun, nostalgic look-back at Han Solo",10,2 July 2018,"Despite the chorus of ""this film is unnecessary"" reviews, I couldn't disagree more. Although this film doesn't further the Star Wars narrative, it circles back to the beginnings of a character well-beloved throughout the fandom, Han Solo. For many, it's a nostalgic throwback, and reveling in the foundational connections between Han and Chewie, Han and the Falcon, and Han and his future self is more than enough to make this film worth while. 
I was hesitant that Alden Ehrenreich would ever be able to portray the Han Solo I knew on screen, but I was pleasantly surprised and downright proven wrong. Ehrenreich delivers the same witty, self-assured Solo Harrison Ford provided us. 
Beyond just Ehrenreich, the star cast has incredible chemistry not just with each other, but with their own character (I'm looking especially at Donald Glover's Lando Calrissian-who he portrays fantastically) and creates a film that's undeniably enjoyable. Frankly put, I think the majority of negative reviews about this film are from folks far too obsessed with non-cannon fic that they've decided IS cannon, or those who simply can no longer find the fun in character backstories.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

Instead of ""I've got a bad feeling about this."" reflecting countless times things have gone wrong, we have a Han who says ""I've got a good feeling about this!"" as he charges in to adventure.So ignore all these joyless people, so threatened by the new, always looking for something to rant about. This movie had us laughing, it had lots of little Easter eggs and fan service (Tera Kasi HA!), and we left the theater feeling good. The Last Jedi very much had the message that the torch was being passed to the next generation, which is a good and necessary thing. Some people would rather see it die than share it with a new and wider audience. Let them fester and complain, in the meantime go have fun at the movies.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

2498,mikesmate-68139,A creative and great use of lighting.,1,17 July 2018,"What was interesting about Star Wars ""Solo"" was Ron Howard's use of natural lighting to give the scenes a realistic feel, instead of opting for a more crisp view of the characters in the Crimson Dawn tower scenes. Where the glare from the windows were part of the terrain or another added obstacle variable in the fight scene. Added to the difficulty of the situation if you put yourself in the character's shoes, instead of being a witness to the fight. It was like you were in the fight.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

2503,bigdamomac,An unbiased review.,9,14 September 2018,"Just had a read of some of the reviews for Han solo, and to be honest I really don't understand why it is getting hammered. It's a very decent film. Obviously it's people who are die hard Harrison Ford's Han solo fans. But come on, people get old and cannot keep doing the same role. Especially not a young version of his self when he is over 70! I am not a star wars fanatic, as to be honest I've got a life lol. And a film is just a film and that is exactly what this is, just another film. And a good one at that. The only thing I can knock is I didn't like Emilie Clark's character. I thought she was acting more or less the same as she does in Game of thrones. Why she didn't use her natural accent which you see when you watch any behind the scenes footage of her, I do not know. It would have come across much better. I mean she's meant to have come from a slum of a planet but she got a posh English accent. Just didn't make sense and was hard to watch. But apart from that. Probably the best of the new ones since Force awakens. All you who are giving it 1 stars....sort your lives out. It's just a movie. Han solo is not a real person. Peace!",Solo - A Star Wars Story
2504,scountjos,Solid star wars for old fans,8,15 September 2018,"I heard loads of negative publicity about solo and this I feel stopped me seeing this when it first came out . I feel a bit bad for Ron Howard who had that to deal with . Anyway got to say I enjoyed it thoroughly the cast was good and some of the jokes reminded me of the original Star Wars as oppose to cringe worthy attempt of last Jedi . The heist is well thought out and perhaps could have missed a trick not connecting a mandalorean thematic , crimson dawn baddies also quite well put together with the ultimate vilan a great come back ! I think the Harrison fordness is harnessed by the new Han and at first I wasn't sure ; at the end of the film my view had changed and Han actually was Han ready to go and work for Jabba . There were also some good kick backs to past Star Wars films : solo vs Wookiee (reminded me of the rancor scene in return of the Jedi) , solo kissing on the millennium falcon being interrupted by wood harrelsons character (c3po interrupts Solo and princess leia In the empire strikes back) and woody harrelson playing Chewbacca at chess (r2d2 scene in the Star Wars new hope) All in all Ron.. a good and solid side flick and Disney need to make more of them . Even if they didn't score first off these can pay for them selves long term and they should continue making them .",Solo - A Star Wars Story

Although know where near to the class of the original trilogy and cast this film gave a good account of itself with fast story telling and likeable characters.

2508,healthandsafety-08804,Paced perfectly and well executed,9,24 September 2018,"I am pretty confused by the amount of negativity I seen on the reviews on the page when this was just out, I grew up with all the original star wars, my older brother buying me a new character figure every week, looking forward to seeing it on TV every Christmas as a treat, fast forward, my own children getting great pleasure from the Cartoons, Lego, Video games and new movies.I thought Force awakens was amazing, Rouge one not an outsider movie in any way, just as good as any of them, episode VIII brave and unique as it put its own stamp on it as its own film (Whats wrong with that?) and I only watched Solo this weekend as I could not get to watch it in Cinema.My opinion, the only weak point in the film was I didn't feel there was any real kind of mentor relationship between Beckett and Han that was put out there, that's all, if he had shot him at the end with the same disregard as he did Greedo it would have worked better for me.That aside, I enjoyed every minute of it and it passed by very quickly, there wasn't any part of it that had me feeling, ""when will this pick up"".For me, another well-deserved inclusion of a star wars style film in the catalogue, I think the only thing that is wrong with star wars fans is expectation, it's not the way they had anticipated it or would have written it.I look forward to more movies from Disney, they are taking over the reins well in my opinion.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

2513,shanekeepenceholdings,Can we try again?,5,7 October 2018,"Like many I was hesitant to watch Solo, so many childhood memories were at stake and now that I've seen it, sadly I'm not surprised. Too some of you it was an okay film, maybe even a good film but should we settle for it? I don't think so. My review aims to look at where it went wrong and set out a basic frame work of future possibilities. A long time ago in a Hollywood far far away George Lucas and his band of rebel film makers broke the cinema mould and pulled off one of the greatest adventure films off all time. In the opening scene we're instantly thrust into adventure, we come face to face with the greatest villain of all time, Darth Vadar and we become invested in a story formula that has kept generations captivated for centuries, save the Princess. While we all endured the whining of Luke, his character develops as we follow him on a hero's journey. He meets mentors, learns new skills and eventually puts them to the test. While a Jedi to be was a thrilling new concept it was the charm of a smuggler that stole the hearts of the princess and audience. Han Solo a man completely invested in saving his own skin and getting paid with the help of his towering and fury companion Chewy kept us glued to the screen for two more films all the while echoing the character in the equally adventurous story of Indiana Jones. Big shoes to fill right? Solo: A Star Wars Story doesn't even come close. But why, where did it go wrong? Some say the Director change, others say the release date was too close to the Last Jedi and most believe Harrison Fords Solo could never be replicated. Well, I think it could and Alden did a decent job with what he had to work with. It wasn't at all the actor, even the direction was okay... well maybe not so much. Where Solo really let us down was in story and grandeur. Think of how Star Wars starts, it's a theatrical orgy of epic proportions, the score sets the scene, the ""a long time ago"" bursts onto the screen and instantly we know we are in for one helluva ride, to this day it still gives me goose bumps. Solo on the other hand is bland. Sure there is a bit of ""a long time ago"" but it's not delivered correctly, and the title card is just there and then it's not, where's the crescendo? It's straight to the back streets and shaky camera work. The whole set up drags out and nothing really happens. It feels like a badly rated Netflix Sci-Fi flick. From there a lot goes wrong. Here's what happened, the writers or producers or both got into a room and said let's write down a list of all the things we want to see in this movie. 1. Hans a street guy
2. Hans a smart alec 
3. He needs to meet some smugglers and become one himself
4. He needs to meet Chewy
5. He needs to meet Lando 
6. He needs to meet the Millennium Falcon
7. And well the rest is history, right?Then they Disneyed that sh#t up: ""Let's add a love interest and a lotta CGI and the writers can fill in the blanks with some characters that will die and the audience will be sad for a moment"". What happened to genuine storytelling, real film structure, character development, the hero's journey and the adventure for goodness sake. The principles and elements required for an epic Solo are simple, it's all about character development so let's jot it down. * Han does need to start as a street guy, a guy that's had it tough, so tough that he is a genuine crook, not a loveable rebel. He needs to come from a place so dark he can kill with out remorse. 
* His world must be turned upside down and he must be thrust into an adventure the audience can buy into, not a plot point about becoming a pilot but a genuine reason for him to set out, think about Luke, his parents were burnt to a crisp and George Lucas showed us their charred remains, it was harrowing. 
* Now he must meet mentors and pull off a job as intricate as an Oceans film, this is what sets Solo's world apart from Star Wars and we need to see he's capable, of course Han is a little more smash and grab then Danny Ocean, but we are talking about a man that will become the greatest smuggler in the galaxy. 
* Of course this must all come to ahead, we need to feel like Han can be the good guy, that he can do the right thing, that he's not such a bad guy after all, we need to see that glimmer of hope and so a moral question and decision must come into play that reveals deep down he has a heart. 
* Of course his decision to be the good guy must backfire drastically, he's double crossed and the only way he can succeed is to look out for himself, he becomes the anti hero. This structure now sets us up for the Han we all come to love in a New Hope. Instead we get some serious movie trash that at no point gives us any reason to be engaged or buy into any of the story or characters. It also felt way to clean for a Solo movie, I was really hoping for some hard edged Christopher Nolan type sh#t. I'm getting side tracked but the lack anticipation really let me down. When Han first sees the Falcon he just gets in and they fly around for a bit. I mean that moment has been building for over 40 years - and he just gets in, that p#ssed me off. Hollywood, I think you need to have another crack at it. Maybe hold off ten years or so to avoid a Spider Man type mishap. Let's put Ron Howard and Dryden Vos behind us, we can bury them deep in our minds with Jar Jar Binks and the Phantom Menace, I'm willing to give it another go if you are? A New Hope if you will.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

The baddy was a bit underwhelming, but given the twist at the end that might be acceptable.Chewie is great, and much of the film is very well done. Special props to the soundtrack, the only memorable one from the entire new crop of films if you ignore the Empire suite from Rogue One, whose soundtrack was also largely forgettable.

Nearly any film is better than those two talent-free films. How is Solo on its own merits?For one, it is useless. It doesn't need to exist. No one asked how Chewie and Han met. Even if they had they didn't want to see it done so stupidly and portrayed by such bad actors.
For another, these Disney films are getting progressively more and more lazy. They just don't bother to even attempt to explain anything. Call it The Ant-Man And The Wasp syndrome. Everything just happens and we have to accept it. The film believe it or not does not bother justifying or explaining anything. How did this happen? Who cares? Who knows? Says Disney. How did the First Order appear? Ah, never mind, How does an old guy and his daughter shrink entire high rises? Er, never mind. You voted for Trump so you can't be smart enough to ask questions like that. In this film, the girlfriend is now an all powerful crime syndicate lieutenant. How did that happen? Who knows?These films, in summary, are boring, have a low quality cast, suffer from both Disney and franchise syndrome and are as a joy to watch as eating a Big Mac and regretting right after.",Solo - A Star Wars Story

B) Through a clever (and familiarly funny) screenplay and entertaining acting, it welcomingly breathes new life into our beloved characters (and their stories) while tying in new beings (both lovable and loath-able), with fresh-yet familiar personalities that shape our heros into who they are. And C) Through respectful directing and outstanding special effects, it gives us fresh knowledge and a new lens into the virtually infinite collection of stories that can be built into the original trilogy that, not only further shapes what we appreciate, but also takes us to worlds and circumstances that we couldn't have dreamed of on our own but are so happy to be taken there, as if to an old friend. I had a smile on my face from beginning to end, watched it 3x over vacation and each time it gave me something new and left me wanting for more.

I have been unhappy with the new trilogy they have been working on and I have half given up on the Star Wars name. Rouge One was okay as a stand alone movie, but Solo why? I have read books that give his back ground and they have mixed and added to it, it was terrible in that aspect. BUT, they caught me. I never grew up with the originals when they came out and I don't even remember the first two prequels coming out. I never had the sense the original fans had, I didn't get to experience the originals in theater, but Solo I had the chance and blew it. I was afraid of Disney's disappointing track records for the Star Wars name. I have recently watched Solo and I have been pushing not to watch it more. I had the sense that many original fans had in the want to know what else happens, though we do due to 4-6. Though it is a stand alone Star Wars movie, again, it was captivating. I could see this movie as another chance on Disney's Star Wars pursuit.
I don't like what Disney is doing and the way they want to make money due to the fans who can't get enough, but this one was not bad if you keep in your mind that it could be ""fan-fiction"" plot line. Keep your minds open if you're hoping for an original trilogy feel.",Solo - A Star Wars Story
