0,TheLittleSongbird,"Okay, but with a lot of faults",6,13 April 2011,"I have read the book. I loved it, I thought it was both chilling and heartbreaking with a fine story and credible characters. I do think it is much better than the film, which was solid enough but lacking a strong emotional core.I will start with the film's faults. The story is a very intriguing one, but it is quite slow complete with holes and any parts that strived to be heartbreaking came across as mawkish. The script is quite weak often, particularly with Susan Sarandon's character in the sense that it is never quite sure which direction it wants to go. But what hurt the film most was some aspects of Peter Jackson's direction. Jackson is a good director don't get me wrong, but he does make some decisions that detract from the impact of the story rather than enhance it. Especially with the CGI, not that it was bad CGI in fact it looked quite good, what I mean was that there was a complete overload of it and I think some of it was unnecessary.However, the film does look absolutely beautiful, with beautiful scenery and cinematography. The score gives a haunting, eerie and intoxicating quality too. While the story is flawed, there is a good atmosphere especially in the more chilling scenes, where they are quite chilling and that's an understatement. Apart from two performances, the acting is quite good. The best performance comes from the very promising child actress Saiorse Ronan, who is just tremendous here. Stanley Tucci is very chillingly effective too, and Mark Wahlberg is surprisingly good. The two performances I wasn't so taken with were Rachel Weisz, who is wasted, and the normally solid Susan Sarandon, who overplays quite badly.All in all, an okay if inferior adaptation. 6/10 Bethany Cox",The Lovely Bones
1,Leofwine_draca,A boring and impersonal look at the afterlife,4,10 October 2011,"What is it with Peter Jackson? The guy is capable of making excellent movies (BRAINDEAD, the LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy) yet, like Spielberg, he keeps making films that should have been great which end up flawed (the KING KONG remake for one). THE LOVELY BONES is his worst yet, a truly disappointing adaptation of a popular novel about a teenage girl who's murdered and finds herself in a kind of limbo while her family struggle to come to terms with their loss.The film feels watered down and weak. The set-up is fine, and all goes well through the murder and Susie's realisation that she's dead and in some kind of dream/fantasy world that's not quite Heaven. Here the film falls apart with another overly bloated running time and a distinct lack of momentum. I was looking forward to some ruminating on the afterlife, but what we get instead is Jackson letting rip with his CGI dreamscape. There are so many pretty effects going on at all times that narrative drive is totally forgotten about.Back on Earth, things are a little more interesting, although not much. Mark Wahlberg and Stanley Tucci give the best performances as the grieving father and sinister killer respectively. However, the female roles in this film are appalling, with Rachel Weisz playing an unforgivably unsympathetic character (I hated her more than the killer) and Susan Sarandon's bizarrely-judged comic relief role just coming across as, quite frankly, embarrassing. Are we really meant to burst into laughter at her shenanigans considering the maudlin nature of all that's come before?The film does feature flashes of inspiration in places, revealing what it could have been. A suspense sequence in which Susie's sister Lindsey finds herself in grave danger is very well realised, but such moments don't sustain the lengthy run time. Wahlberg's nice-guy personality and Tucci's dodgy behaviour aren't enough to keep us entertained either. Saoirse Ronan is pretty weak, I thought, and I was never once moved by her character's plight as I should have been. No, THE LOVELY BONES is a definite missed opportunity and I hope Jackson rediscovers some of his former magic with his forthcoming Hobbit movies.",The Lovely Bones
2,SnoopyStyle,mishmash of tones,6,25 January 2015,"It's 1973 in a Pennsylvania suburb. Susie Salmon (Saoirse Ronan) is 14 years old living with her parents Jack (Mark Wahlberg), Abigail (Rachel Weisz), younger sister Lindsey (Rose McIver) and brother. She likes Ray Singh who slips a note into her book. As she walks home through the cornfield, she encounters her neighbor George Harvey (Stanley Tucci) who takes her into his underground hiding place. She escapes but eventually figures out that she's actually been murdered. School outcast Ruth lives by a sinkhole. That night, she sees Susie's spirit and finds Ray's note. Detective Len Fenerman (Michael Imperioli) investigates the disappearance and then her murder. Suspicions fall on Harvey but there isn't enough evidence. Holly is another Harvey victim who urges Susie to move on. The Salmon family struggles and Jack asks his hard-drinking mother Lynn (Susan Sarandon) to stay with them.The movie suffers from a mishmash of different tones. The serial killing is dark and horrific. Then there is the magical otherworld which needs to be much more creepy. It's too magical and not enough tension. Saoirse Ronan is terrific who keeps the movie upright. I don't even know what Sarandon is doing in the movie. This movie is trying to slam together a teen girl romanticism and a serial killer horror movie. The mashup doesn't really work but it is an interesting attempt.",The Lovely Bones
3,Hitchcoc,Was It That Bad?,6,12 February 2010,"Having read the book and gone into the theater without reading any reviews, I was astonished at the venom directed at the film. I agree that it is disappointing, but so many said it was about the worst thing ever produced. When one sees speculative fiction like this, we are caught in our own preconceptions of what the afterlife would be. I hated ""What Dreams May Come"" because it had that pretentious view that we are spoon fed our whole lives of a palpable heaven and hell. This one has some of the same elements. What driving force in the universe would bother to solve a murder mystery or bring closure to people who are already dead. However, the acting is good. The story is moderately interesting. The characters are certainly worth the trouble. Stanley Tucci is really marvelous, so it's hard to imagine giving this only a one out of ten.",The Lovely Bones
4,Horst_In_Translation,"Sometimes good, sometimes not so good",6,3 February 2016,"""The Lovely Bones"" is an American 135-minute movie from 7 years ago written and directed by Peter Jackson. He and his wife adapted the popular Alice Sebold novel for their work here. This film was made after Jackson had finished the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy and before he moved on to ""The Hobbit"". The genre here is entirely different compared to his epic adventure films. But he still tries to give it a special touch and this is probably what hurt the film the most. I definitely would have preferred this movie with almost no fantasy references at all. It would have been okay with Ronan's character watching her killer and her family deal with the consequences of her murder, but that's it. Sometimes it feels as if Jackson intended to make this really epic, but the whole tone and topic is just not suited for that. I certainly would have preferred this being the chronology of a crime with what happens before, during and after the murder.I believe this was a missed chance. If Jackson had done it the way I wanted, it may have been too different from the base material, but I still would have preferred that. Maybe the book just isn't a good basis for film. The cast in here is very talented and there was absolutely the possibility of this turning out a wonderful experience. I am not saying this is bad or a failure of any kind, but it's more of a missed opportunity. It is still a good film, even great during some occasions. Tucci was nominated for an Oscar for his performance here and even if I preferred him in ""Julie & Julia"" from the same year, I still believe he played his part excellently in ""The Lovely Bones"". His scene with Ronan down in the cave is easily one of the highlights. Wow.. his laugh was so creepy. Another memorable moment would be Ronan realizing what really happened to her when she realizes where the killer put her corpse and the scene with Ronan's character's sister trying to find the evidence in the killer's house was incredibly tense. Great chase sequence.The heart and soul of the film are not only Tucci's and Ronan's performances, but it is also the story about being able to move on after losing a beloved one and, at the same time in this film, for the one who was lost to move on. What I did not like as a consequence was what happened to Tucci's character in the end. It feels like justice somehow and of course, it is somewhat of an audience pleaser, but to me it completely goes against the point of the story. It was all about the family finally being able to leave behind what they had to leave behind in order to lead a fulfilling life again. The fate of the killer became irrelevant to them at this point and what actually happened to him then was a complete contradiction to the family's well-being. On a less important note, I think the way Wahlberg's character realizes who the killer is was not particularly well done. It felt neither credible nor realistic. And if the killer really had such a long history of crimes, then how incompetent must the police be to still not realize he's the one they were looking for. I also did not like the romance parts about Ronan's character and the boy at school and the other girl at school. This reference to letting go did not feel too accurate to me. It was really all about the family.All in all, this was a good film, but not nearly as good as it could have been if it had been closer to Eastwood's ""Mystic River"" for example. But I guess gritty crime thriller just isn't Jackson's thing. Anyway, Ronan and Tucci make this one certainly worth a watch, even if I believe they should have kept it a bit shorter, maybe at 2 hours max and not much of value would have been lost. Overall, I give it a cautious thumbs-up.",The Lovely Bones
5,claudio_carvalho,I Really Wanted to Like This Film.,6,3 July 2010,"On 06 December 1973, in Norristown, Pennsylvania, the fourteen year-old suburban teenager Susie Salmon (Saoirse Rona) is lured and murdered by her pedophile neighbor George Harvey (Stanley Tucci) that hides her remains in a safe in his basement. Susie sees the despair of her beloved family and the serial killer from heaven.I really wanted to like ""The Lovely Bones"", a film that puts Peter Jackson, Susan Sarandon, Rachel Weisz, Mark Wahlberg, Stanley Tucci and the awesome Saoirse Rona working together. Unfortunately the screenplay is awful and the direction of Peter Jackson is terrible, wasting Rachel Weisz with a minimum participation and Susan Sarandon in a silly role. Stanley Tucci is excellent, as usual, and Mark Wahlberg is effective in the role of a grieving father seeking out his missing daughter. The girl Saoirse Rona is fantastic but unfortunately she is unable to save a lame screenplay that oscillates between a beautiful fantasy ""à la Ghost"" to a senseless heavy drama. Peter Jackson does not succeed in balancing the elements of the dramatic story and makes a much messed, unpleasant long film. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): ""Um Olhar do Paraíso"" (""A Look from the Paradise"")",The Lovely Bones
6,kosmasp,To know or not to know,9,8 September 2010,"I have to admit, that I haven't read the novel yet, therefor can not judge the movie, by how faithful it is to the book. Now that that's out of the way, let me tell you that I thought it was one of the best movies I watched this year. It's poetic, it's acted very great and even the fact, that the ""twist"" comes very early on does not have a negative impact on the movie.Of course, it is almost impossible not to know, what the early twist is (even if you haven't read the book, like me). If possible try to avoid reading too much beforehand and just walk into the movie, just knowing Peter Jackson made it. And although even the mystery is taken away (you know who did what), it is beautiful from beginning til end. There are so many great visually stunning scenes, that are also acted great, that I just had to love it.The pace might be a problem for some. But try not to think about it too much. And hopefully you will enjoy it as much as I did.",The Lovely Bones
7,lee_eisenberg,beyond the world of hobbits and giant apes,6,27 February 2019,"Having made his mark on cinema with the LOTR trilogy and ""King Kong"", Peter Jackson took a slightly different turn with ""The Lovely Bones"". I knew pretty much nothing about it when I started watching it, so the material was shocking. I wouldn't call it any sort of masterpiece, but the movie certainly did what it set out to do. I found the grandmother to be the most intriguing character, as she continues her life no matter what happens. I can see why Stanley Tucci (in an Academy Award-nominated performance) wanted to rein in his character's actions. But the bulk of the credit goes to Saoirse Ronan in the lead role. She gives it the same energy that she did in ""Hanna"", ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" and ""Lady Bird"".In the end, I recommend it.",The Lovely Bones
8,jboothmillard,The Lovely Bones,4,1 August 2011,"I think I saw this reviewed on Film 2009 with Jonathan Ross where he gave it a little bit of a mixed review, and I heard a few things about how the book that this is based on is better, but I willing to give it a chance, from director Peter Jackson (The Lord of the Rings Trilogy, King Kong). Basically Susie Salmon (Atonement's BAFTA nominated Saoirse Ronan) is the fourteen year old girl who is telling the story of her life, and more significantly her death, in 1970's Pennsylvania, from a place between Earth and Heaven. Pedophile serial killer and neighbour George Harvey (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Stanley Tucci) raped and killed her, despite the fact that she saw herself escaping the room beneath the ground in the field. As she explores this fantasy world where anything is possible, she watches her family, including father Jack (Mark Wahlberg), mother Abigail (Rachel Weisz), sister Lindsey (Rose McIver) and alcoholic Grandma Lynn (Susan Sarandon). They are all obviously distraught at the death of Susie, but also at the disappearance of her body, and it seems to many things that happen on Earth cause change in the new fantasy world. For example Jack had a hobby for placing small model ships in clear bottles, and when one or two of these are smashed this appears in the fantasy world as large full scale ships in bottles crashing to shore. Ultimately Susie is watching over them as they grieve for her, struggling to carry on with any life they can without her, and seeing the evil Harvey seemingly getting away with his crimes, but in the end he gets what he deserves and Susie is allowed to pass on. Also starring Michael Imperioli as Len Fenerman, Jake Abel as Brian Nelson, Amanda Michalka as Clarissa, Reece Ritchie as Ray Singh and Thomas McCarthy as Principal Caden. Ronan gives a good young performance just like her previous film, Tucci as always gives a great performance, here as the dangerous man, and Whalberg, Weisz and Sarandon also get their time on screen. Of course the real star of the show, besides a near enough engaging story told by a dead character, are the special effects to create the beautiful afterlife world, if you think back to Jackson's film Heavenly Creatures it is nearly similar kind of feeling, I can see that the film has its ups and downs, but overall a reasonably enjoyable fantasy drama. Okay!",The Lovely Bones
9,Tweekums,An interesting film despite its flaws,7,28 May 2012,"The opening narration by fourteen year old protagonist Susie Salmon tells us that she is going to be murdered; this doesn't take away from the drama it adds to it as there is a sense of dread as she goes with a trusted neighbour to the place she will die. Even though we know she is going to die it initially looks as if she has got away from the man but it soon becomes apparent that something isn't right; she runs through almost empty streets and the few people she sees don't appear to notice her. By this time she is late home from school and her parents are starting to panic; it is only a matter of time before the police find her hat and a large quantity of blood; there is no sign of her body though. As time passes her father finds it harder and harder to move on; constantly calling the police with his latest theory as to who might have done it. His wife can't take it any more and moves out shortly after her mother moves in. All the while it looks as though the killer is taking an interest in another potential victim; Susie's sister Lindsey. All the while this is going on Susie is somewhere between this life and an afterlife; another girl, who calls herself Holly Golightly, tries to guide her onwards but she isn't ready; not until her family have come to terms with what has happened.I had heard fairly negative comments about this but thought I'd give it a go as I'd enjoyed Saoirse Ronan more recent performance in 'Hanna' and while it had its faults I thought it was a good film. I really cared about the characters and thought the depiction of the family's reaction to their loss was very believable, equally I thought the depiction of the killer as a rather bland person rather than either an obvious monster or a charismatic charmer was realistic. The acting was solid throughout; Saoirse Ronan brought an ethereal quality to the role of Susie and Mark Wahlberg put in a suitably emotional performance as her father. The film wasn't just an emotional drama; there were also some genuinely scary bits such as when her sister went into the killer's house and it looked as though he would catch her. Those are the good things; on the negative side the depiction of the afterlife with its vivid colours and copious CGI didn't work for me. Over all I think it was better than I'd heard and is well worth watching despite its flaws.",The Lovely Bones
10,moonspinner55,"Ordinary crime-drama juiced, jazzed-up and jam-packed with computer-generated imagery...",5,11 March 2011,"Adaptation of Alice Sebold's book by Fran Walsh, Philippa Boyens and director Peter Jackson is an elephantine serial killer story/death fantasy narrated by one of the sociopath's victims. At its core, the screenplay consists of easily identifiable elements, the central figures being: the missing teenage girl from a Pennsylvania suburb in 1973, her frantic and distraught family, the police detective working the case and the neighborhood loner responsible for the girl's demise. It's fairly easy to see from the outset why Jackson was attracted to this project; it presents a chance (though not quite an ideal one) for the artistic-minded filmmaker to go crazy with his canvas, turning the girl's afterlife experience into a dazzling realm of changing seasons and climates. Jackson is a master at visual detail and scene transitions, but the minutiae of this simple yarn trips him up. The family unit integral to the plot of ""The Lovely Bones"" isn't very convincing--and when the parents argue and separate, one doesn't question why or even care. Perhaps fearful of turning Sebold's fictional story into a unrelieved downer, Jackson refrains from giving us too much human suffering--he just wants the proceedings to look good. As a result, this tale of life and death and beyond soars across the blue horizon a dozen times, yet it fails to be a moving testament to the human condition. Jackson keeps his camera racing, his pacing taut, but all spirits in evidence seem dampened by the general excess. ** from ****",The Lovely Bones
11,paul_haakonsen,Do You Remember December 6th 1973?,5,18 May 2010,"Well, this movie was not nearly what it was hyped up to be. Or maybe I just had a bit too high expectations, either way, I was disappointed.Now don't get me wrong, the movie is not bad, quite the opposite actually. The movie is beautifully put together, but I had expected something more from it. There was a lot of visually nice scenes and images, but the story dragged on for a bit too long, making it a bit prolonged to get through. And also, there were no real big moments that carried the movie.As for the cast and the acting, nothing bad here. Lots of nice actors and actresses in the movie, and their performances were nice. Especially the role of the killer, that worked so well. That guy was perfect for that particular role.If you like psychological movies that give you stuff to think about, then this movie might be right up your alley. But don't expect any thrills of a grand scale, nor any toe-curling thrills or twists. The story is pretty fair straight going all along the movie, which kind of makes the movie drop down a notch.Having seen it now, I can honestly say that this is not a movie that has repeated watching value. Once you've seen it, that is pretty much it. I had expectations for the movie, expectations that sadly weren't fulfilled.",The Lovely Bones
12,Quinoa1984,"a grand, sloppy folly for Peter Jackson, his writers",3,16 January 2010,"I'm not sure how so much could go wrong on this film. It seemed like a pretty sure thing: a book that has been very widely acclaimed and read as a work of sad life-and-death meditation from a 14 year old girl looking down or somehow from the ""in-between"", a kind of purgatory, after being raped and murdered, on her family and killer. It seems like the stuff that could make for some harrowing dramatic material... or, possibly, a sappy story. It turns out Jackson takes the latter route, but there's more than that wrong here. It's a giant miscalculation that has a few moments of real impact and where the performances match up with the material.Maybe it's just a general attitude that Jackson and his writers, wife Fran Walsh and Philippa Bowens, take from the book. What might have been poignant observations, for example, from the girl Suzie Salmon (like the fish) becomes a series of really jagged narration in the film that is a) poorly written, b) in a continuously ineffective and/or annoying tone from Saoirse Ronan (who is not bad in the film, by the way, when the material requires it), and c) it's redundant. We see her sights in this in-between world, moving about and in quick motions without consistency, though as with Avatar one might say at least it's ""pretty"", and her descriptions are at best unnecessary and at worst just stupid. It's some of the worst use of narration last year (compare it to The Informant! and see how much of a drop-off it is).But narration is just one thing. Another is a lack of focus in the story, and actually getting to really care about any one of the living characters. It's not really the actors fault, as Wahlberg, Weisz and Imperioli do what they can in their roles (Wahlberg especially, in spite of everything, throws himself into the devastated father well). When it comes time for us to really get into the emotional grit and horror of this situation, of how horrible it really is, it's actually glossed over by Suzie's situation up in the in-between. There isn't a solid 'conflict' about who the killer is since it's revealed in the first few minutes of the film. On top of this the logic on Stanley Tucci's character is all-too obvious - it's a perfectly creepy performance, but a little subtlety might have helped. And then there's the lush grandmother played by Susan Sarandon that is used for very ill-timed and unfunny comic relief midway through the movie, after which she's pushed aside to a reactionary role.And yet I didn't have as big a problem like some critics have had, which is with the in-between itself and its visual scheme. While it's not as imaginative as Jackson seems to think it is, it does reflect, more or less, what a 14 year old girl's emotional state would be in an afterlife world. It's more-so a problem when Jackson deals with balancing this fantasy afterworld with the real one, and the rules of how Suzie reaches out to those is never firmly established (the one girl she brushes against running down the street is one thing, her parents and sister are another). It's not so much the sights but, again, a mood and attitude that Jackson botches: what is with this Asian girl that accompanies Suzie? It's explained, to be sure, as are the other victims of Tucci's child killer, but the attachment she has with her previous life and family is screwy, it becomes muddled and unsatisfying.I would almost stop short... no, I would just about claim that this is close to being the kind of cloying, sappy crap that one would usually find its way onto Lifetime, where struggles are put to melodramatic limits, and by the end every plot strand, no matter how unlikely, is resolved (one of those, involving Rachel Weisz's character, is just ridiculous in its timing). And yet for all of the story and character problems, for all the clunky dialog, Jackson has a few moments where he can let his actors have room to breathe. Chief of these are scenes involving suspense, when Suzie is in the lair of the man who will kill her, which is a gradual scene of weird intensity, and then later a scene where Tucci comes into his house while Suzie's sister is snooping around. Little glimmers of the kind of filmmaker one saw from fifteen years ago on another movie about teenage girls and the fragility of life and death and love, Heavenly Creatures, in such real dramatic clarity and power. But that's all really.The Lovely Bones has so much that could go right with it that it's most disappointing how wrong it goes. It takes someone with as much talent and passion as Jackson to screw up on this level. He and his writers have not made an exactly boring movie, but it could very well be for some in the audience. I found myself shaking my head and frowning at what I saw, a watered down vision of reconciling grief and loss, and at best a mixed-bag of a story surrounding a not-whodunit about a child killer. Some may be moved, and more power to them. I couldn't wait for this wishy-washy journey to end.",The Lovely Bones

The charges of style over substance I sort of understand, it sometimes dose feel like Peter Jackson showing off, but then again he is good at it and produces some stunning sequences here. As a story and how it is told becomes an emotional roller-coaster, a shattering tale of grief and anguish, of hope and peace, and judgement. All told by a cast on fire, giving intensity and sincerity at all the right junctures.It's one of those films where you understand if someone detests it, it very much is a specialist film hoping to find someone to love it.

15,Theo Robertson,The Mixed Messege Screams Kill Them All And Let God Decide,5,16 November 2012,"This was a highly anticipated film on its release . Based upon the cult novel by Alice Sebold and directed by Peter Jackson it opened to very Luke warm reviews by the critics . Normally I don't care what critics say but since I was very short of money I decided to save myself the price of a cinema ticket and catch it for free. In the mean time a lot of time had passed before I caught it tonight and I don't know if the criticisms of the film adaptation of THE LOVELY BONES had prejudiced my own opinion but this is a highly offensive film and we all know why don't we ? Roger Ebert summed it up perfectly when he called this film deplorable . The premise of the film centres around a 14 year old girl called Suzie who is raped and murdered by George Harvey . Jackson does his level best to make the inciting scene of the rape and murder as tense and as frightening as possible without causing offence . The irony is that as soon as Suzie reaches the afterlife any viewer with the vaguest notion of secularism will be very offended to think that a murdered 14 year old child will be enjoying them self in an afterlife beyond all human imagination in its beauty . Put it like this : If this was a film featuring a protagonist fighting Jihad and woke up to the afterlife seen here would you believe there wasn't an agenda behind it ? Of course I'm not for a second stating there is any spiritual/religious/political agenda behind the film but this is the totally confused unintentional message Jackson is giving out It's a certainly a beautiful film from a technical viewpoint . Jackson is certainly influenced by the aesthetic beauty of the best Michael Powell movies and the cinematography is worthy of Jack Cardiff at his very best which is complemented by the visual capabilities of 21st century film making . All this is enhanced by the haunting score from Brian Eno . Unfortunately all this belongs in a different film entirely such as a film with an original screenplay featuring perhaps a doomed love affair, perhaps a film where someone remembers someone who they can never have In short Peter Jackson is the completely wrong choice for director . A film featuring a victim of child murder should be gloomy and introspective made with a much smaller budget . It certainly wouldn't have had the critical anticipation that Jackson had brought but it certainly wouldn't have had people complaining that the message of this film screams that "" Kill them all and let God decide . Dying has never been so much fun """,The Lovely Bones
16,jotix100,From heaven,4,16 April 2011,"Something strange happened with the adaptation of Alice Sebold's novel ""The Lovely Bones"" by Peter Jackson and his collaborators. The book was one of the most read in the country after it was published. Unfortunately, what comes out on the screen is far from what Ms. Sebold wrote about, so the finished product is, at times, irritating, at best. The mere thought of translating the text into a motion picture, must have been a daunting work on the part of Mr. Jackson, Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens.The creators of the film decided to treat the material in a way that does not make much sense. Granted, we are told from the start about the fate Susie Salmon suffers. George Harvey, it turns out, was a serial killer that ended many a young life during his lifetime of crime. Susie narrates the story from a rarefied world where everything is lovely, meeting the other victims of Harvey. Some sections have a feeling of being a video, without the music.The basic problem points to miscasting. Originally Ryan Gosling was to play Jack Salmon, but withdrew from the film. Mark Wahlberg, who had finished another film in the area, became available and ended up playing the father. Susan Sarandon's Grandma Lynn has been made to look as a caricature. Rachel Weisz has nothing to play in the film. On the other hand, the Susie Salmon of Saoirse Ronan is about the best thing in the film. This brilliant young actress shows her talent in giving life to the murdered Susie. Rosie McIver is equally impressive as Lindsay Salmon. Stanley Tucci makes a creepy murderer.Like some films in the IMDb forum, this one has attracted some person, or persons, that had gone on to make certain comments as ""not helpful"" just to express their displeasure with a lot of valid opinions submitted.",The Lovely Bones
17,dbborroughs,Pointless misfire from Peter Jackson. It doesn't seem to have a point except for a few beautiful sequences in the next life.,3,18 January 2010,"(Possible spoilers follow) The easiest way to sum the film up is by saying ""WTF?"" I have not read the book, though to be honest after seeing the movie I really don't want to. Its mostly not a bad movie, but I have yet to figure out what the point of it all is, and as for the ending-let's not go there.This is the story of a young girl who is murdered and who hangs in a transitional world where everything is ducky watching over her family and the man who killed her. She watches how in the wake of her murder her family breaks apart and comes together and her killer continues his day to day activity, safe knowing that people have mostly stopped looking for him.Other than the imagery, which is spectacular, and the details, which aren't much of anything, you now know as much about the movie as I do even after I've finished watching it. I kind of see the point of how life goes on in the wake of tragedy and how bad people sometimes get away with things (more about the ending later) and how we aren't really gone after we go, but by the time I got to the end, waiting, oh Lord was I waiting, for something to happen, I was kind of shocked when nothing did. Yes there are all sorts of things going on between the characters in the family, but as for grand revelations there was nothing. I would have loved even no message but a catharsis at the end concerning the killer, but nope there is only one of the silliest moments I've seen in a long time and it produced loads of laughter from those seeing the film in a completely ""You must me joking"" sort of way.I don't get it. And I spent over two hours of my time watching this because....? What were you trying to tell me? Yes I know you made some incredible images with what is found in the place on the other side of life, as for the rest of it I don't see the point.I'm a huge Peter Jackson fan. I know sometimes he hits (say Heavenly Creatures, Forgotten Silver and Lord of the Rings) and I know sometimes he misses (King Kong, Dead Alive), but even when he fails the films seem to have a point, and a sense of purpose. This time out I don't think he knows what he was trying to say.A major misfire and probably my least favorite Jackson film.",The Lovely Bones
18,Bunuel1976,"THE LOVELY BONES (Peter Jackson, 2009) ***",7,19 February 2010,"Director Jackson followed his hugely-successful ""Lord Of The Rings"" franchise with this adaptation of another highly-regarded but more recent novel; though, on the surface, it seemed a more realistic and intimate project, the premise still managed to take in a considerable dose of fancy (and, by extension, elaborate visual effects). The film, in fact, revolves around the murder of a teenage girl, the effect this has on her family and the eventual come-uppance of the seemingly mild-mannered man responsible; so far so simple, but then we are shown the heroine's passage towards Heaven – and, apparently, these scenes constitute the piece's raison d'etre (since it would otherwise be fairly ordinary). Anyway, apart from obvious technical proficiency (even if the CGI – as ever – is painfully evident), it demonstrates reasonable insight into a child's view of the afterlife; still, the whole reportedly emerges a bowdlerized version of the source material – with, ultimately, its most lauded element Stanley Tucci's rather overrated and clichéd portrayal of the villain: introverted, meticulous and with an annoying fixed smirk, his ironic demise comes as no real surprise (ditto for the identity of the other 'lost souls' the girl encounters). Despite a starry supporting cast (Mark Wahlberg and Rachel Weisz as the girl's parents and Susan Sarandon as her spirited grandmother), the film's true core resides in Saiorsie Ronan's affecting central role – recounting events in first-person narration, she evinces all the various unspoken aspects of an untimely passing: anger at the circumstances themselves, the witnessing of a family's disintegration and the initial escape from justice of the perpetrator, remorse over one's own unfulfilled aspirations and feelings, etc. That said, all the various moods – psychological study, social conscience, ethereal vision – do not really coalesce into a satisfying experience which, at 135 minutes, is also way too long; mind you, as a modern film, it is well up to par, hence the ratingbut, typical of most of today's output, it is not one I am likely to ever return to!",The Lovely Bones
19,grantss,"Good, but could have been great",7,28 February 2016,"Good, but could have been great. Started off well - the family life was sketched beautifully. However, the girl's death (not a spoiler - read the movie summary) caused the movie to drift. Peter Jackson got very self-indulgent with gratuitous surreal CGI scenes. The movie didn't really get any better after that and the ending was a bit trite and, with many better possibilities on offer, a let-down.Solid performances by Mark Wahlberg, Rachel Weisz, Saoirse Ronan and Michael Imperioli. Stanley Tucci puts in a superb, menacing performance and well deserved his Best Supporting Actor Oscar nomination. Susan Sarandon's performance as the wisecracking devil- may-care alcoholic grandma is an understated gem.Despite some of my previous comments, there is enough goodness in the movie to make it watchable. The plot might have gone nowhere, but the emotion, feeling of loss and a life unfulfilled make the movie a decent one. If Peter Jackson had concentrated on those aspects, rather than showing off his CGI skills, this would have been a great movie.",The Lovely Bones

I haven't read the book, and indeed did not have any clue it existed until I found out that this adaptation had been made; thus, I cannot comment on this as a cinematic version of the novel, but I imagine it must be better, as crap tends not to get translated into other mediums. What I've heard others say is that this tries too hard, cramming in as much as it can without getting half of it right. Yes, this looks stunning(if glossy and cutesy enough for tween girls to think it excessive), however, nearly none of the FX have a smidgen of emotional impact, they're just pretty pictures. This is the trap that many film-makers with the cash required fall into now that the tech is available. I respect Jackson, and I was rather impressed by the LOTR trilogy, which I did not expect to like. He has shown he knows how to use CGI immensely well; I haven't lost faith in his abilities, and hope that the future will prove this to be a misstep. Another problem with the animation is that little of it has ""weight"" to it, so it feels like mere images; while I realize that it was meant to come off as otherworldly, it winds up looking like it isn't ""there"", the illusion comes apart and we find ourselves looking at Ronan giddily running around surrounded by green-screen for extensive portions of this. This honestly could have been considerably shorter. Little character is developed; this keeps cutting away before it happens, and in general this has a tendency to jump away from scenes before we completely get into them. Some of the interactions are credible, and this mostly has a good sense of humor. There's a montage that's an outright complete waste of time. It can be corny. This does contain brief suspense. And no, I didn't go in thinking this would be packed with tension, I merely did think that it would have me more engaged in it. The thing is, this takes our lead from a perfect life to an over-the-top idyllic afterlife. I suppose they meant for all the drama to occur with her family, though if that was the plan, I have to wonder why they kept going away from them, to show us her existence ""there"". There is plot, and for a while, it does move ahead; then it stops, and stays in park. The acting talent here is incredible, and it is not any fault of theirs that this fails to affect us. This has a nice message and themes; unfortunate that the former takes forever to get to, the latter aren't explored that well, and that neither amount to enough to make this a satisfying movie-going experience. There is a bit of disturbing content, infrequent moderate to strong language and brief brutal violence. I recommend this only to those interested solely in the visuals. 5/10",The Lovely Bones

Peter Jackson's visually overloaded yet heartfelt adaptation of the vastly popular novel by Alice Sebold about the brutal murder of a 14 year old girl during the 1970s (Ronan in a remarkable performance) whose soul lingers in the afterlife trying to communicate with her loved ones to bring her killer (a truly creepazoid performance by Tucci) to justice. Strongly knit acting, impressive production designs and shrewd sprinkling of music (best sequence set to Tim Buckley's ""Song To The Siren"" by This Mortal Coil"" affectively hauntingly ethereal and pitch-perfect!) makes the story come alive even if its candy colored fantasia gets away with itself from the heart-breaking storyline crafted.",The Lovely Bones
23,view_and_review,A Kiss Better Than Heaven,4,11 November 2021,"This was one slow moving drama about a serial killer. The girl of subject, Susie Salmon (Saoirse Ronan), was murdered by her neighbor George Harvey (Stanley Tucci), but no one could prove it. Susie hung around in the ""in between"" (somewhere that wasn't heaven and wasn't hell) lingering in hopes she could go back. Her family tried to move on without her but found it too hard. Her father (Mark Wahlberg) kept on fruitlessly searching and trying to find the killer to the point he wasn't available as a father or a husband. Her mom (Rachel Weisz) couldn't handle it all and moved out, and her grandmother (Susan Sarandon) filled in to take care of the remaining two kids.The entire movie is a waiting game to see if everyone will find out what we as the audience already know. Susie still has a tenuous connection to the real world so we're wondering if she will point the right people in the right direction to find her killer.The world does find out who her killer is when Susie's sister Lindsey (Rose McIver) went snooping around George's home and found the incriminating evidence, which led to a mind-boggling scene.After Lindsey risked life and limb to find evidence implicating George as her sister's killer, she rushed home narrowly escaping George's clutches. She barged in her home with the one thing her entire family had been pining for for months and then she stopped to marvel at her mother's return home. Then she patiently waited for her mother and father to have a warm reunification as though that was the most important thing at that time.I, for one, was beside myself with incredulity. How could ANYTHING be more important than the smoking gun needed to prove who killed Susie?I couldn't imagine anything that would have distracted me from making sure I showed that evidence to my dad, my mom, the police, the world. Yet, there was Lindsey blithely gawking at her mother and father as though what she had to share wasn't that important after all.After George failed to nab Linsey he skipped town with Susie's body in tow.He was never caught though he did die in a painful manner, so it was pseudo-justice. Susie would eventually move on past the ""in between,"" but not until she did a move from the movie ""Ghost"" and invaded a girl's body so she could have a kiss with her crush.And that spoiled it all.The movie was already moving too slowly and dramatically for my taste, but I was willing to stick it out. When Susie refused to cross over until she got a kiss from a boy she was crushing on, the previous two hours were thrown down the drain. It would've been palatable had that not happened, but to think that someone would forestall heaven, paradise, the garden of Eden just for a kiss with a boy she hardly knew... gimme a break. I thought she wanted to have one last look at her family, or one last hug of her father, but no. She needed to be kissed by and Englishman before she could happily cross over.",The Lovely Bones
24,neil-476,"Rather unfocused, not as good as it should have been",6,24 February 2010,"I started Alice Sebold's novel, but never got that far through it - I kept waiting for something to happen, but nothing much did. The film is a bit like that, too.The central conceit of murder victim Susie Salmon narrating the story of what happened after her death, retained in the movie, is a good one, but the central element of her parents being unable to deal with her death seems to have got a little lost in the movie.Saoirse Ronan is excellent as Susie, and most of the rest of the cast is pretty good too, with two exceptions: Mark Wahlberg is totally out of his depth in a role which requires him to act with some emotional subtlety, and Stanley Tucci should have had ""serial killer"" tattooed on his forehead - it would have been less conspicuous than the twitchy, creepy, deeply suspicious range of behaviour he exhibited.The visuals of Susie's limbo were eyecatching but oddly uninvolving.Ray and Ruth came over as afterthoughts, and the nature of Ruth's final gift to Susie was less than obvious.There is stuff in this movie to appreciate, but it's not Peter Jackson's finest hour by a long stretch.",The Lovely Bones
25,AlsExGal,"A look into author Alice Sebold's psyche, but clouded by special effects",6,19 April 2016,"If the movie had been truer to the book I would have given it 8/10, but as it is, it just makes being dead seem super cool and Jackson injects too much CGI into a story that just doesn't need it. Plus, do you really think it would be heaven to look down on your loved ones and see what they are REALLY doing? Their true faces? I don't think that seeing their sins, big and little, would be comforting at all. Mom what are you doing with that detective??? BLECH! (That's in the book not in the movie). The story is that of Susie, a 14 year old girl, destined to be forever 14 when she is raped and murdered by a neighbor in 1973. She floats around, looking at events below throughout the film, until she finally enters into heaven, conversing with her killer/rapist's other victims.To understand this story, overall, you have to have read Alice Sebold's autobiographical work ""Lucky"". Sebold was raped at the age of 18 when she was still a virgin by a total stranger on the last day of her freshman year while walking to her dorm late at night at Syracuse University. The rapist was an African American who admitted to her during the ordeal that he had raped before, but for some reason thought that this kind of behavior constituted a date. Did I mention that he beat Alice to a pulp? Sebold came from an intellectual family. Her father was a renowned figure in academia on the subject of Spanish literature. Her mother was a cross between Susie's mother and Susie's grandmother. Mom had briefly been an alcoholic and had periods of raving (the grandmother), but Alice also always sensed that her mother rather resented the burden that the 1950's had put on her - society pushed women into the role of wife and mother (Susie's mother). Like Sebold, the character of Susie has one sister.I'm telling you all of this to show you that this work appears to be another albeit fictional work in which Sebold tries to deal with her own rape back in 1981. Her liberal intellectual roots have her painting the rapist in this story as an ordinary seeming white man that fit well into middle class society, when in fact her own rapist was a black career criminal, a serial rapist of any vulnerable woman he came across when it suited his mood, and with a long rap sheet of violent crimes before he raped Sebold. But Sebold's intellectual liberal roots have her feeling some ""white guilt"" in ""Lucky"" even as she assists the prosecution with convicting this animal.Another complicating factor is that Alice Sebold's rapist - never mentioned by his right name in ""Lucky"" even though we display the name AND picture of convicted rapists in newspapers everyday - probably arranged to have her closest friend and college roommate raped by a criminal associate two years after Sebold's rape in retaliation for his well earned maximum sentence. Since the roommate would not cooperate with police and threw Sebold out of her life afterwards, nobody can know for sure. But things that the roommate's rapist said, mentioning Alice and her routine, and insisting on raping the roommate on Alice's bed, suggests that is what happened. Imagine what these two traumas did to Alice Sebold? What they did was send her into a ten year tailspin of self destruction, at the end of which she discovered that she had PTSD, got treatment and is supposedly ""cured"". But how could anybody ever be cured of such traumas? Some have even said that Sebold is in fact Susie, dead, lingering between this world and the next - the girl she was before all of this violence looking for the life that she had before rape. It's an interesting thought.If you read ""Lucky"" you realize that Sebold even has a hard time coming to terms with the rage and desire for vengeance she must have had for her rapist. This is illustrated in ""The Lovely Bones"" when Susie's killer is never arrested or convicted by the authorities, not even violently avenged by her father or some other caring friend or family member. Instead he is killed by a falling icicle in a freak accident. A most passive death for a horrible criminal. It is like Sebold is trying to say that God makes things right in the end, when to me, God appeared to be otherwise occupied during both Susie's and Sebold's ordeal. Maybe suffering and injustice mean nothing at all.I'd say I moderately recommend this filmed version of Sebold's excellent literary work, but I highly recommend you read first ""Lucky"" and then ""The Lovely Bones"" to get the most out of it.",The Lovely Bones
26,ferguson-6,Like the Fish,6,23 January 2010,"Greetings again from the darkness. With the uproar from fans of Alice Sebold's novel, I am actually glad I have not read it yet (though I will). I found director Peter Jackson's take to be very interesting, attention-grabbing and well filmed. The fact that the actual murder and rape are not shown did not affect my ability to connect.Certainly not a who-dunnit, the viewer instead is exposed to the many forms of grief after a family tragedy. I found myself quite angry at Rachel Weisz (the mom) for deserting her kids, though I understand the clash with Mark Wahlberg's (the dad) approach. Not only was I angry at her as a parent, but as a viewer, her running away meant more screen time for Susan Sarandon, which is rarely a good thing.Saoirse Ronan (excellent in Atonement) plays Susie, the victim of neighbor Stanley Tucci's crime. Tucci is my favorite kind of movie villain ... non-descript and blends right in. I find that to be the creepiest possible monster - the one that lives amongst us. Some of Jackson's camera work with Tucci is fascinating and frightening. We can't wait to see this guy burn.Again, I consider myself lucky in that I can appreciate the film for what it is rather than comparing to a great book. Oh, and don't miss Peter Jackson as the customer playing with the video camera in the store when Wahlberg picks up the first roll of developed film.",The Lovely Bones

It regards the young innocence of Saoirse Ronan whose character is murdered and her soul is caught within a warped view of Heaven overlooking her grieving parents and the murderer who got away. One of Peter Jackson's more intriguing films with extraordinary visual images. He previously made King Kong as well as The Lord of the Rings films. Ronan reveals the anguish of a disturbed soul. She begins the film as a hopeful young photographer but trusting the wrong person leads to an unsolved tragedy. Stanley Tucci plays off the creepy ordinariness of the guilty neighbor. This is one of his best performances as he counters accusations and hinders any revelation until poetic justice takes affect. Mark Wahlberg and Rachel Weisz play the parents who deal differently with the trauma. Susan Sarandon delivers a little comic relief as grandmother. What is truly devastating is a family torn apart unable to mend together. The Heavenly aspect may come across as warped to certain viewers but every object in Ronan's world carries meaning at some point. The visual effects are certainly lovely but the message regards injustices that go unsolved and the lives affected. Score: 8 / 10",The Lovely Bones
28,FlashCallahan,Grandma Lynn was wrong.......,6,1 March 2010,"Based on the book that i have never read, the lovely bones is a strange little film, and a strange choice of film for Jackson, who surely wanted to retrace his 'heavenly creature' steps making this.The plot is as follows, Susie is murdered by her neighbour, and spends the rest of the film in a kind of heavenly purgatory, not because the killer hasn't been apprehended, because she is seeing her family not coming to terms with her death, and slowly breaking apart.Jackson doesn't do his best with the narrative or the flow, and at times you can really see where parts have been cut out, because they just land on the screen in a mess. But that only happens a few times, so it's only a minor flaw. Wahlberg puts in probably his best performance since Boogie Nights, but is still acted off screen by Tucci and a decidedly comic Sarandon, who steal any scenes they are in.The strongest scenes in the film that really cause any emotion, both involve Tucci, the first being the encounter he has with Susie on the field, his body language oozes evil, and the scene has an unnerving sense of dread to it. The second, is when Susies sister is in the killers house, you will never know how tense the slightest noise can be, this is again thanks to Tuccis body language.The scenes that should have been more emotional, the ones between Susies parents, feel redundant and rushed, they never really discuss the situation or how they are feeling, and Wahlberg goes on the rampage a little too unconvincingly.but still, it's very well made, even if the purgatory sequences feel a little too 'what dreams may come' and the film does have the worst villain death ever, call me sadistic, but i wasn't satisfied with the punishment.For Jackson, it's time to realise that CGI isn't always the way. For Tucci, it's a triumph.",The Lovely Bones
29,phd_travel,casting weak,2,14 July 2010,Ronan is good moving without overacting. But the other cast members were odd picks. Marky Mark just looks dumb and you can't feel for him at all. Why is he getting these serious roles that don't suit him? Rachel Weisz doesn't look like she could be related to Ronan at all - Rachel's looks are too dark and non waspy. Her American twang is unconvincing. Stanley Tucci just doesn't look menacing at all - you just can't feel the slightest sinister vibe from him at all. It must be his acting. Unlike other actors who can be so convincing as serial killers that you have a hard time getting the image out of your mind in later movies - Tucci just looks comical. Only Sarandon is good - in her element. Beautiful imagery and some moments of suspense are found here. The story is annoying especially the end.

30,gradyharp,"Taken as Movie, NOT as Screenplay form Sebold's Book, It is Entertaining",5,13 May 2010,"THE LOVELY BONES is a quiet novel about horrendous events described eloquently and with spiritual insights by author Alice Sebold. While the book, being a rather introspective version of the murder of a young lass, would be difficult to translate to film, Peter Jackson (with a screenplay adaptation by Fran Walsh, Philippa Boyens and Jackson himself) should call this version an idea inspired by Sebold's book. If desiring a reenactment of the novel is the viewer's desire, skip this film, but if simply watching a 'different' Peter Jackson epic is your cup of tea, this film will romance you. The young girl Susie is well played by Saoirse Ronan, and her parents are rather one dimensionally brought to celluloid by Mark Wahlberg and Rachel Weisz, with a lot of help from the over-the-top portrayal of Susie's meddling kooky grandmother as molded by Susan Sarandon. Susie's sister Lindsey (Rose McIver) gets to experience all the things the deceased Susie wanted to experience, Ray Singh gives an interesting bit of strange aura as Ray the one Susie would have loved had she lived, and Michael Imperioli serves well a the policeman who continues to endlessly track the murder. But the film holds together because of the smarmy serial killer George Harvey, yet another stellar performance by Stanley Tucci. He is terrifyingly believable and should scare everyone who watches is sick mind work. The special effects are 'pretty' in a sort of Hallmark cards way and Jackson tries his best to make us follow this maladaptive transformation of Sebold's novel. But given all the negatives THE LOVELY BONES is still worth watching, if only as a momentary diversion. And it would be a shame not to see this performance by Stanley Tucci!

31,zetes,A flop,5,31 January 2010,"Say what you will about The Lord of the Rings trilogy and his King Kong remake, but there was definitely a giant talent in Peter Jackson behind that camera, as well as behind the pen that wrote them. So it comes as something of a shock that he could make a film as bad as The Lovely Bones. I haven't read the original Alice Sebold novel, so I can't say if any fault lies there (fans of the book swear it doesn't, but I tend to think fans of books are way too forgiving of poor plotting). Almost nothing about Jackson's adaptation works. Okay, I will say this upfront: it looks great. Not only the now infamous purgatory special effects sequences, but the period settings, the costumes, etc. It's never less than great to look at. After that, though, not much to recommend. Saorsie Ronan (Atonement) plays a teen girl who is murdered by serial killer/kindly neighbor Stanley Tucci. As she stays in purgatory, waiting for justice, her family (Mark Wahlberg her father, Rachel Weisz her mother and Susan Sarandon her grandmother) tries to cope. Okay, the purgatory sequences: Peter Jackson just puts too much stock in his firework-like special effects. It's the main spot where he concentrates his talent. Unfortunately, the entire concept of a special effect-laden purgatory is a huge miscalculation. The focus of the story just doesn't belong on this. You're too busy watching it and saying ""neato"" to really get any sense of what this story should be about. The other side of the story is a little better, but, with his concentration elsewhere, we never really understand, for instance, why Weisz leaves Wahlberg to go pick oranges. And Sarandon, whoo boy. Another gigantic miscalculation. She comes back into the story in full force shortly after Ronan's murder to provide comic relief. There's a particularly awful montage sequence where Sarandon attempts to put the family back together by dancing with the younger son, smoking cigarettes over breakfast and putting too much detergent into the washing machine. Stanley Tucci has gotten a lot of praise for his performance as the murderer, but it's a pretty awful performance. It is a different kind of performance than we usually see from Tucci, but that doesn't make it good. He screams ""child molester"" every time he pops up on screen. It's hard to believe anyone would follow him into his molestation dungeon (Ronan literally follows him into this hole he dug in a cornfield!), or that the cops wouldn't consider him a possible suspect after they enter his dollhouse-full living room (they might as well find a stash of lollipops in his glove compartment). Oh, don't get me started on the climactic sequence. It just makes no sense. I'll only briefly mention the fact that Tucci can somehow load an enormous safe (containing Ronan's body) into the back of his truck by himself, but when he wants to throw it into a sinkhole at the end, it takes him and another fella about 20 minutes to roll it in (maybe he should have parked a tad closer; they seem to move it a half mile). And, man, the very end, the end of Tucci. Just try not to laugh too hard. I honestly didn't hate it as much as I'm letting on. Ronan is very good, and I thought Wahlberg didn't totally embarrass himself. Like I said, it looks great. It's never really boring. It's just not good at all.",The Lovely Bones

I can understand that some people will find it gruesome due the subject but I must say that it had no drip of red stuff in it. Not that that is important, just look at Texas Chainsaw or Halloween, they were bloodless too. Nevertheless, I really enjoyed this creepy flick. It reminded me a lot of The Loved Ones somehow, it must be the use of slow motion and the score. On the other hand it also reminded me of Heavenly Creatures by the way they used the dream sequences. It's a special flick coming from the hand of Peter Jackson. Knowing him for splatter and gore in his earlier days this could be a let down for some but I really liked it the way it was shot and the use of CGI didn't bother me at all. Not for everyone but if you can stand weird flicks than this won't be a problem for you.",The Lovely Bones

This time you don't have to try to figure out who the killer is. Here you immediately know who the murderer is and you follow the whole story from the narrating voice of the deceased played beautifully by Saoirse Ronan. All actors did a great job with their performances. The way of filming was also very nice to watch. And even though you already know who the killer is the storyline is build so that you don't lose any interest during the whole movie.

34,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: The Lovely Bones,8,3 April 2010,"I suppose Peter Jackson's probably experiencing what James Cameron had planned to avoid when he directed the biggest movie of the year back then, and that's not to get crushed by the weight of expectations that unfortunately come around naturally. We know how the Kiing Kong remake fared, and now The Lovely Bones which had been getting a whole lot of mixed reactions, but one which I am firmly throwing my weight behind.It's not a bad film, and I sense that it could have been the subject matter dealing with death, reconciliation and moving on, that may not sit well with most audiences. There's no big bang special effects to wow the crowd, and neither any heavy melodramatic piece with an open and shut investigations. While the trailer had given out the entire plot, there's still this sense of dread that's permeating throughout the film, making watching it somewhat of a chore not because we know of the storyline, but because we're powerless to help the characters get through their ordeal, or to see to it that justice gets served, properly, and not in the manner it was dished out in the film. There are no easy resolutions, and it is precisely that which will likely get you riled up and think, what's Peter Jackson doing?But it is exactly this sense of dread that makes the film stand out, and each time providing that heightened sense of danger whenever George Harvey (Stanley Tucci) is on screen. Peter Jackson seemed to relish building a number of such high tension scenes that plays on what we already know, and feeds from our worst fears and dread to propel the narrative forward, not necessitating to show us in full what the outcome of his dastardly deed toward his victim Suzie Salmon (Saoirse Ronan) since there's nothing more vivid than the individual power of imagination. But that doesn't mean that Jackson doesn't take the time to show the depth of evilness of such a character, providing a glimpse of that through a really creepy string of scenes that almost guarantee will make the young ones cry (PG people), and your heart a little painful.The scenes that Jackson dwells on, are the reaction to the loss of a valued family member, a loved one. Time is spent amply to build up the picture of a close knit and happy family whose perfect life as they know would be inexplicably shattered by the evil of man – as Suzie puts it, they were living at a time when such atrocities were unheard of, where innocence would be lost. The film highlights how individuals try to move on, with some doing so more easily than others, and those who cling on to the sliver of hope that something will be done, or an outcome will miraculously turn favourable. It's a good break for Mark Wahlberg as it seems to shy away from an action role – instead of kicking butt, he gets his butt kicked hard here – and he returns to a dramatic role that calls for strength and persistence as the head of the Salmon household.Rachel Weisz too held her own as Suzie's mom, though I felt that her performance was split into two, the earlier one pre-Suzie murder the better of the lot since narratively she disappears midway through the movie, leaving Rose McIver to pick up where she left off as Suzie's sister Lindsey. To lighten the mood, Susan Sarandon enters at an appropriate time to pepper the film with some light hearted moments as the all smoking and drinking Grandma Lynn, the balance of reactions between both parents, and the surrogate guardian of the Salmon children.Saoirse Ronan was excellent in Atonement, and backs that fine performance with another fine one as the protagonist narrating the story from somewhere in limbo between Heaven and Earth. She's the spectre who can peek into the human world, and have to deal with both the ghosts of her past and the evilness that continues to haunt her, and that light at the end of the tunnel she, and others, have to move toward. Like all folklore dealing with spirits, they're never quite gone so long as there's unfinished business left on earth, and I thought the finale of her story was well done, bringing resolution, and for a happy moment, an opportunity to gain back what was unfairly taken away from her, without her putting up a fighting chance.Ultimately, it's a sad film dealing with very real human emotions about loss and the different reactions to it. People move on, and we do so for as long as our mortality dictates. In the meantime, only those who are close to you, will remember you as you disappear in a flash like the wind, memories like pictures keeping you quite alive to your loved ones while that in others start to wane.

35,siderite,Give me my two hours back!,6,23 December 2010,"I would have expected more from a film directed by Peter Jackson, based on a novel and starring people like Mark Wahlberg and Susan Sarandon and Rachel Weisz and Stanley Tucci if I'd only known those facts before watching the movie. As it were, I only knew of a positive review from a horror blog and so I've decided to watch it. The lack of expectations didn't improve my feelings about it, though, as it snailed through scene after slow motion scene, while the voice of a girl slowly explains what she feels and what other people are feeling. I swear by the end of the film I was sympathetic to Stanley Tucci's character.Bottom line: two full hours of boredom, occasionally peppered with some very beautiful CGI that has actually no purpose in the plot. Every actor played great, but it didn't help the film in any way, because everything was SLOW. I honestly had the feeling that someone has taken a normal one hour and a half movie and slowed it to 75% speed. Was an attempt of making a thriller for women? Because it gave me the same feeling I have when watching a romcom.",The Lovely Bones
36,namashi_1,A Major Letdown!!,3,9 April 2010,"Peter Jackson's film adaptation of the award-winning and best-selling 2002 novel of the same name by Alice Sebold, 'The Lovely Bones' is a major letdown from this accomplished filmmaker.'The Lovely Bones' is a dull, dry and depressing experience. The film has a tepid start, a bland middle and a boring end. I am a big Peter Jackson fan right from the 'LOTR' series, I even enjoyed 'King Kong', but this film just didn't work for me.If there something that works in this film, it's the performances. Stanley Tucci is incredible, delivering one of the finest performance of his time. He steals the show! Saoirse Ronan plays her part well. Rachel Weisz is fantastic from start to end. Mark Wahlberg is decent. Susan Sarandon is passable.There's nothing lovely in 'The Lovely Bones', apart from the acting. So watch this if you must. From my side, Thumbs Down!",The Lovely Bones
37,StevePulaski,A failure on a grandscale,4,3 January 2014,"If Disney made a film about rape, death, and the afterlife, it would probably look a lot like The Lovely Bones. Here's a film that already has the enormous challenge of bringing a very difficult, weighty story to life. Thankfully, it has the grandscale medium that is film to bring it to life and a visionary director at its hands.But despite having both of those benefits, The Lovely Bones still manages to be a tedious, emotionally manipulative exercise. A film that gets lost in its source material but not in the good way, and is tonally all over the place. It takes place in 1973, centered around Suzie Salmon (Saoirse Ronan), a fourteen-year-old girl who is brutally raped and murdered after being lured into a fortress by her neighbor Mr. Harvey (Stanley Tucci). Suzie is then transported to purgatory, that space between Heaven and Earth, where she watches over her friends, her killer, and her distraught parents Jack (Mark Wahlberg) and Abigail (Rachel Weisz) as they all try to piece together her death and look for answers in a sea of dead ends.Right off the bat, I was burdened by several ways writers Jackson, his wife Fran Walsh, and Philippa Boyens go about handling this kind of sensitive material. Frequently do scenes occur, some big, some small, that feel either out of place or botched in their focus. Early on, when we are seeing Suzie's life as an ordinary girl, we she at one point she actually saved her younger brother after he stops breathing. She hops in the families cherry-red convertible and speeds down the road with her brother in the backseat. The scene is a tad frightening, but the music and quickly-paced editing makes it seem like a car chase. Some scenes are just completely burdened by their own corniness, like the scene when Suzie is at the mall with her grandmother, gawking at the local neighborhood boy at the record store and narrating how dreamy he is with his lengthy eyelashes. Then we get to hear how talking to boys gives Suzie ""the skeevies."" It doesn't take many of those kinds of scenes to derail an entire project, but the film finds ways. It manages to take the strong themes of rape, death, and the afterlife and cheapen them by the use of emotional manipulation, mawkishness, overemphasis on special effects, and the PG-13 rating, which I'll address later on. However, the film gets many scenes right, specifically the scene when Suzie is walking home after school and meets Mr. Harvey in a dead cornfield. The scene is awkward and unsettling, the perfect combination for something like this. Jackson parallels the scene with the Salmon's having dinner, wondering where Suzie is, while she's being lured into Mr. Harvey's underground clubhouse he has made for the neighborhood kids, complete with soda, candles, toys, and board games. ""One rule,"" he chillingly states, ""no adults allowed."" Another effective scene comes when Suzie is beginning to enter the afterlife and finds Mr. Harvey soaking in a bathtub of dirty water, with her bloodied clothes and jewelry scattered all over the bathroom. Mr. Harvey sits idly in the bathtub, with a hot rag over his face while the background is a painful sea of white. This is as graphic as the film is going to get in terms of what we see, which is already diminishing the impact of the story being that the rape scene is more deluded than freshly-made Kool-Aid stuck underneath a water faucet. This is where the Disney aspect I mentioned comes into play. While The Lovely Bones has these meaty morals and themes, it plays everything safe, never showing us the tragedy at hand and instead spoonfeeding us meticulously-detailed computer-generated landscapes in an effort that detracts from the sadness of the story at hand.I could maybe forgive all of that if the message I took away wasn't the one I wound up taking away. I'm sure this wasn't Jackson's intention, but with the use of attractive special effects that make purgatory look more desirable for Suzie than the current life she's living, it's as if the film is saying that the rape and murder of Suzie was essentially a good thing as she was liberated from the world that robbed her of her creativity in favor of one with a limitless range of possibilities. Because of this, I am unable to accept the film. I'm also surprised at the fact that women's rights activists haven't lambasted this film, considering the film's seems to be communicating a message that is pretty bothersome in the long run. And don't get me started on the grandmother character here, played by Susan Sarandon, whose character has next to no value and feels entirely out of place, especially when she interrupts a string of depressing sequences with her hustle and bustle.Jackson's visuals are nicely orchestrated for the most part, however, Andrew Lesnie cinematography is very enticing, and the performances - specifically Ronan's and Tucci's - are commendable. But they are all included in a film that plods along, communicates a questionable message, manipulates you emotionally, features cloying narration, a corniness it simply can't shake, and a handful of scenes handled in a hackneyed format. If anything, this is a good companion piece for Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close, right down to the portrayal of big-name actors in the bland roles of distraught parents.Starring: Saoirse Ronan, Stanley Tucci, Mark Wahlberg, Rachel Weisz, and Susan Sarandon. Directed by: Peter Jackson.",The Lovely Bones
38,blanbrn,Though you feel the sadness and sorrow. Your guided and connected with emotional love from a heavenly spirit.,7,19 January 2010,"Director Peter Jackson for one is not known for this kind of sad drama mystery fantasy type film, instead we know his special lies with sci-fi and fantasy with over the top special effects and CGI. And with ""The Lovely Bones"" which is adapted from a 2002 novel by Alice Sebold still Jackson uses the CGI to make the viewers mind wonder with bright and dreamy scenes which lighten the film up as I cheer him from staying away from the gore and gruesome scenes of Susie's death, yet the novel was frank and blunt of her horrible murder. Still even though many may feel Jackson's direction is out of place, the film is paced well it tells a story and I for one felt sorrow, connection, and hope proving that after death we can be touched by heavenly spirits.Set in a small Pennsylvania town in 1973 it centers around the Salmon family as Susie(played wonderful by Saoirse Ronan)is brutally raped, and horribly murdered one day on her way home from school. After this the entire film consist mostly of the two themes of flashback and foreshadowing as departed Susie tells her story from heaven following a narrative like path. Many may not like the scenes, but I for one was taken in enjoyment of the colored sharp magical scenes of heaven which makes pretty good use of CGI.Aside from the treat of bright colors this picture even though sad gives us hope in such a way that it touches our spirit. After the murder Susie watches all along from heaven a scenic afterlife seeing everything unfold on earth she keeps an eye on her father and mother(played just fine by Mark Wahlberg and Rachel Weisz)as even her siblings and other friends heal from her loss as they search for the killer. Good supporting relief some comical and painful is found in the form of Susie's cougar and boozy grandmother(played elegantly and over the top by veteran Susan Sarandon).Most memorable and striking is the killer who as you can see from the beginning that this guy named George(Stanley Tucci who gives a grade A performance)is a very creepy strange no personality non sociable stalking strange neighbor of the Salmon's. The screen time of this villain is jolting as his desires and interiors are so gross yet his strange creep like feel carries the film along with Susie's guiding spirit to the point to where you the viewer want answers as you feel the need for closure and justice. Oddly as you will see justice and grief is solved in the oddest and most unexpected way, as evidenced the lord and heaven both work in mysterious ways.True this may not be the best film of 2009 still it spotlights the power of a heavenly soul while showing in contrast the sick and wicked side of bodily urges on earth. It's nice to see even though many see it as to fairy tale that we can be guided and touched in such an emotional and spiritual way after losing a loved one as anything is possible in the afterlife if heavenly.",The Lovely Bones
39,MovieAddict2016,The film's lack of commitment to any singular theme renders the picture offensive rather than just boring,2,3 January 2010,"Peter Jackson's The Lovely Bones is a colossally misguided failure. Based on the well-received 2002 novel by Alice Sebold, Jackson -- along with his Lord of the Rings cohorts, Philippa Boyens and Fran Walsh -- has penned a meandering screenplay, made merely all the worse by uniformly awful performances, poor editing, and generally bad film-making.Mark Wahlberg (who stepped in to replace Ryan Gosling prior to filming) is in Happening mode, which means he's doing that insincere, dopey nice-guy routine again that he's particularly bad at; Rachel Weisz disappears for half the movie, Susan Sarandon acts like she fell out of a Farrelly Brothers comedy, then also disappears for half the movie; and relative newcomer Saoirse Ronan is a bit too precocious for her own good. And Stanley Tucci, in the role of a twisted serial killer, alternates between horrific and morbidly humorous, as Jackson attempts to have us laugh at this guy's predicaments and then root for his demise. The whole movie doesn't have a clue what it wants to be, and because the thread of the story -- the brutal rape and murder of a 14-year-old girl -- is so deplorable, the film's lack of commitment to any singular theme or idea renders the picture offensive rather than just boring (which it certainly is as well).Jackson doesn't like dialogue, as is clear from his recent roundtable discussion with fellow directors. That's fine. But it's hard not to assume his inflated ego is to blame for the movie's visual excesses -- maybe the sequences in heaven were poignant in the novel, but here they seem distracting and unnecessary, pulling us out of the main narrative (the human story, no less), which needed all the help it could get to begin with. Furthermore, for a director with such a renowned visual sense as Jackson, the special effects sequences are simply bad -- no more or less fantastical than a standard television commercial advertising anti-depression pills. Let's hope TinTin fares better.For major studios, January is considered ""dumping grounds"" -- a time to toss aside the aborted Oscar contenders or latest Eddie Murphy comedy. Jackson's movie was originally set for release at the end of 2009, in time for the awards season, but was delayed a wider expansion after disastrous test screenings and subsequently scathing reviews. One of the film's final shots is of a character discarding an unwanted object into a big hole in the ground, burying it from existence -- it's hard not to see the irony.",The Lovely Bones
40,Red-Barracuda,An emotionally harrowing film,8,27 July 2011,"I was quite surprised to see all the negative reviews for The Lovely Bones. When I watched the movie I not only knew nothing about it's story but I didn't even know that it was Peter Jackson's latest film. So I came to the film with no preconceived ideas or expectations. I did however, used to frequent a book forum seven or eight years ago and I do remember that quite a lot of people were discussing a book called The Lovely Bones, although having not read it I don't think I paid terribly much attention but it did seem to be a novel that was frequently mentioned. Now, having seen the film it does seem to be that much of the negativity - although not all - seems to be directed at the movie from people who are familiar with the book. From what I can see a common thread seems to be the over-use of misguided CGI effects. I obviously can't really comment on this but I can say that from my point of view the fantasy world that Jackson created did seem at odds with the overall feeling of the film at times. However, other than this I have to say that I found The Lovely Bones to be quite an intense emotional experience, and overall I was very impressed with it.The film shares some noticeable common ground with Jackson's earlier Heavenly Creatures with it's combination of a troubling story about an adolescent girl and it's integration of a fantasy world. The heart-breaking story is essentially about the rape and murder of a fourteen year old girl by a paedophile neighbour, and her subsequent ability to view the emotional fallout of this devastating event from a heaven-like fantasy world inhabited by the dead. The subject matter is pretty horrendous and uncomfortable to say the least, and even though much of it is implied (the sexual assault) or committed off-screen (the murder) it remains deeply disturbing. The killer's underground room in the middle of a field recalls the gingerbread house from Hansel and Gretel, it's a pretty unforgettable and terrifying creation. Behind the candy-like CGI visuals, The Lovely Bones is a depressing and disturbing story. The scene where all the killers little victims meet in a Utopian field to the hauntingly beautiful 'Song to the Siren' by This Mortal Coil is especially heart-breaking.The film is helped considerably by great performances all round. With particular standouts being Saoirse Ronan as Susie Salmon the victim, Mark Wahlberg as her father and Stanley Tucci in the incredibly thankless role as the child-killer. In my view Peter Jackson mostly holds things together very well. The Lovely Bones is clearly an ambitious film to pull off, with it's unusual combination of family-drama, horrific murder, inventive fantasy world and occasional pulse-pounding thriller moments (the scene where Susie's sister invades the killers house being a standout of the latter). There are certainly some moments that are poor - such as the unsatisfying demise of the killer - but they are relatively minor in the grand scheme of things. At the end of The Lovely Bones I felt a little bit emotionally drained, and I imagine that was what the film was supposed to achieve.",The Lovely Bones
41,KineticSeoul,Peter Jackson should never do a film with a lot of romance in it,4,17 February 2010,"Peter Jackson should not direct a movie with a lot of elements of romance in it, cause it turns even more corny than the 2 twifag movies...Well close enough. There were a couple of dumb teens that could not keep there mouth shut in the theater especially the girls while texting and laughing at the corniness of the film, but I just had to agree with them. This is suppose to be a serious film about a young girl who gets murdered by some creepy pedo and her body gets locked inside of a safe. And her spirit watches over her family and she can't get to heaven without getting vengeance or some sort of closure. Now I haven't read the novel, but I am pretty sure the novel was more emotional than this film because this sometimes felt like a comedy because of the uber corniness of it all. A lot of of the budget seems to have gone to portray heaven, and it was decent. The only reaction I saw from the audiences was just laughter and texting and a bit of a cheer near the end because the pedo dies. Anyways I had some expectations for this film when I saw the trailer and thought it was going to be good, but it's just a let down.4.6/10",The Lovely Bones
42,Buddy-51,fluid adaptation of a tricky premise,8,4 August 2010,"""The Lovely Bones"" is Peter Jackson's visionary adaptation of the bestselling novel by Alice Sebold. Sebold's audacious conceit was to have her story told from the viewpoint of a 14-year-old girl (touchingly portrayed by Saoirse Ronan) who has just been kidnapped and murdered by the neighborhood pedophile (the movie takes place in early 1970s suburbia). Susie's adventures in the afterlife are placed in direct apposition to a family's inconsolable grief, their attempts to come to terms with an unimaginable loss, and the efforts on the part of local law enforcement to bring her killer (creepily played by Stanley Tucci) to justice. And what role, if any, can Susie herself play in effecting such an outcome from her place in the great beyond? There are those who will balk at the undeniably morbid nature of the material - and, indeed there are times when the why and the wherefore of it all seems as elusive to the storytellers as it is to the audience (the script was written by Fran Wa, Philippa Boyens and Jackson). Still, this is a technically accomplished, visually stunning, and eerily mesmerizing melding of the worldly with the otherworldly, as Susie and her father (Mark Wahlberg) both learn the importance of letting go and moving on.In his direction, Jackson flows seamlessly between the dual ""realities,"" refusing to set up clear lines of demarcation between the two. The result is a fluid work that feels all of a piece - one that rarely jars us with gear-grinding tonal shifts or heavy-handed transitions. Moreover, the mood is greatly enhanced and sustained by Brian Eno's haunting and ethereal score.All in all, a stylish and engrossing film.",The Lovely Bones
43,Robert_duder,"Visually breath taking, a brilliant film with a lack luster ending?",8,3 July 2010,"It seemed strange when I heard of this film that big epic film director Peter Jackson was helming the film. It didn't seem his style and yet its easy to see now that he put all his talent behind this one. The incredibly dramatic story and heart wrenching scenes are decorated with the most fantastical and beautiful scenery perhaps ever seen in a film and without the ridiculous current fad of 3-D. The scenes of the bottles breaking on the beach left me literally jaw dropped in the theatre. One of the most fascinating parts of The Lovely Bones is how the incredibly dark and disturbing nature of the film is completely balanced by the fact that we are witnessing and adventuring with the little girl that loses her life. While her family grieves we know she has moved on to the other side and is with them the whole time. You can't ever feel depressed because this girl is more alive than ever on the other side. Still the horrible circumstances around the family is brilliantly portrayed by the cast and brilliantly directed. The film is easily one of the beautiful, stunning, and terrifying films out there.Mark Wahlberg gives one of the best performances of his career. He is a versatile actor and that isn't always a good thing. He can give some of the worst (The Happening) performances and some of the best such as this among others. As the grieving father he gives an award worthy performance. Rachel Weisz is also good as the mother and wife. Surprisingly she doesn't give the strongest performance and in fact is overshadowed by the other power house performances. Then again it would seem as though the mother is not the key player in the film which is unusual for this type of story. Much has been said about the performance of young star Saoirse Ronan who plays the murdered Susie Salmon. Her performance is brilliant and she spends so much time in the brilliant after world and still manages to perform so moving. Rose McIver plays the determined and torn sister of Susie who ultimately takes matters into her own hands to find the truth. While she does get a little overshadowed by the powerful performance of Ronan she is still excellent. Supporting cast members are excellent including first rate performances by Reece Ritchie, Michael Imperioli, and a smash performance by the legendary Susan Sarandon. And finally we have Mr. Stanley Tucci as the deranged, twisted, and charismatic George Harvey. His performance was Oscar nominated. Does that make it the best performance in the film? In my opinion not by a long shot. If the ability to look completely different is a talent than Tucci nails it big. And his performance is great...you find yourself repulsed and terrified by Harvey and at the same time the character also leaves the largest let down in the film. Tucci is amazing though.So without giving away the ending...and I have never read the book whatsoever, I found the ending disappointing and it was the same as the book apparently. I understand the ending, and I get the whole Karma works theory but I felt like the Salmon family never got their justice, their closure even if Susie Salmon does. Regardless of how I felt about the ending the movie itself is nothing short of sheer brilliance. The fantastical special effects, the moving story, the powerhouse performances, makes this probably one of the best films of 2009 for its pure artistic quality. This might be small potatoes for director Peter Jackson but it is solid proof of why he is a master of his craft. You won't ever find a crime drama told in this fashion and I suggest anyone who wants something dramatic but completely different should check this one out. It is a must see and sure to be a classic. 8.5/10",The Lovely Bones

Indeed, I've often thoroughly enjoyed films that most people have said are cr*p and if the concept and storyline is interesting enough, there's just no stopping me from checking it out. Such was the case with The Lovely Bones, another film Peter Jackson directed when he isn't doing another Lord of the Rings movie. While I don't regret seeing it, there are definitely some bones to pick with some parts of it.The idea behind this certainly is quite interesting, and very dark and mature for such a film, and the opening scenes certainly catch your attention...but with child-like impatience, Jackson is eager to let his talent for showcasing breath taking special effects take over, and while they are visually quite amazing and impressive, they detract from the story, which becomes a bit disjointed and sketchy, failing to keep you up with it all the way. The performances are pretty good, even from ex rapper Mark 'Marky Mark' Whalberg, but this is a far from awful but rather forgettable experience, a mix of the innocence of childhood and the harsh reality of the real world. **",The Lovely Bones

It never even shows her talking to Susie's sister or family telling them what she felt the night Susie went missing. And the discovery of the killer was rather uneventful.

I like how director Peter Jackson took such a complex novel and turned it into a film that's relatively easy to digest. The world of Purgatory, in Jackson's mind, seems like a wonderful place and I loved how he used such creative visuals to show his world. I'm surprised at the split reaction between critics and audiences because while not as good as the Lord of the Rings trilogy or King Kong, this film is still very, very good.Jackson's film is about a 14-year old girl who was murdered and she decides to stay in the between world of Earth and Heaven to help her father find her killer. But she must decide whether she should allow her family to move on or not.The acting is very, very good. The two actors I single out are Saorirse Ronan and Stanly Tucci. Ronan is a very talented young actress and our protagonist does a great job in this story. And Tucci doesn't play his usual role and he really got intense, creepy, and scary in his role. The other members of the cast such as Mark Wahlberg, Rachel Weisz, and Susan Sarandon also do an amazing job.Overall, this is an excellent film and I can't see how people rated this movie so low. It may be different from the novel but it should be because of the complexity. This film also packs a punch of emotion.

The highlight of the film, for me, is without a doubt Stanley Tucci, who is immensely transformed and powerfully disturbing as George Harvey, his performance was absolutely riveting, it is just a shame it could not have been for a film that deserved him. The movie tries too hard, it is throwing messages, metaphors and imagery at us left, right and center that it forgets that characters and realism captures an audience far more that impressive visual effects. There is so much going on at once that a lot of it becomes muffled. Several members of the cast misses the mark, speaking of, Mark Wahlberg is unconvincing in this film, it is not a part that was right for him, I never truly believed he missed his daughter and wanted redemption for her. Susan Sarandon plays Susan Sarandon so much that it took me out of the movie completely, she didn't fit the film's aesthetic and her character was brought in to the plot in such a forced manner that I could not help but feel a little cringe. Forgettable. While it had good intentions, The Lovely Bones pales in many areas and is certainly Peter Jackson's weakest movie, give this one a miss.

Director Peter Jackson (Lord of the Rings fame) starts routinely but gets to stretch his legs a bit later in the movie with some fantasy stuff that seems borrowed from ""What Dreams May Come."" The first half hour drags its feet, however, and if there is tension, finally, after the main crime, there is also a feeling of indulgence (and therefore slowness), in many parts after. And deliberate repetition. Deliberate.None of this is smart or brilliant stuff. It's all too familiar and actually (sadly) clunky. Even the inter-spiritual, world-to-heaven stuff (you know, the people sensing the dead, the dead sensing real people). The parents in the home situation, Mark Wahlberg and Rachel Weisz, are pretty dull stuff. Only the grandmother, Susan Sarandon, cuts through the dreck, and she really only appears much after the halfway point. Most of all, the bad guy (one of those sweet/demented men) in the form of Stanley Tucci, is seen too little. Not that his character has an ounce of originality.What, in the end, is the point of it all?

This was billed as one of the front-runners to win best picture or at least be Oscar nominated in 2009, due to scathing reviews it was pushed back a bit. Saoirse Ronan's portrayal of Suise is absolutely wonderful, but I felt her character didn't get enough justice served to her, the ending didn't give me what I wanted, I was heavily disappointed. Every time I was getting emotionally attached or intensely involved, it would always do something to create an annoyance for me, there was just so much more done that I wanted. Some of the visuals of Heaven were quite astounding to see I admit that, and Suise's narration was very well done, but I simply cannot forgive the atrocity of an ending. Susie's fate deserved much more and all that waiting and anticipating didn't pay off near to what I wanted in the end. Criticism aside I enjoyed my time with this movie for the most part, it will tug on your emotional strings.Performances. Saoirse Ronan is fantastic as Susie, definitely one of the best child actors out their now. Her bubbly enthusiasm and desperate positivity despite the circumstances was great to see. Mark Wahlberg has clearly grown up and gives quite possibly the finest performance of his career. I was blown away by the emotional, yet likable performance he gave, and it teared my heart apart watching him anguish over his daughter. Rachel Weisz is very good as the Mother, but somewhat cold and stand-off for my liking. I didn't attach myself to her like the rest. Susan Sarandon gives a funny if eccentric performance as the grandmother. Stanley Tucci plays one of the most despicable characters I've ever seen. He was so good at times, I often forgot some of the likable work he's given over his career due to my hatred for his character. Rose McIver is excellent as Lindsay the younger sister, she did great.Bottom line. In all honesty I really should give this an 8 out of 10 due to my enjoyment out of it, but there are some things that could just not be forgiven.

Starring Mark Wahlberg, Rachel Weisz, new comer Saoirse Ronan, and a villainous Stanley Tucci in a remarkable role for him. Susan Sarandon is the grandmother played for a nicely balanced comic relief. Lovely Bones incorporates a multitude of genres, including family drama, teen romance. This is eventually an intensely emotive and revealing movie about love and hate and of the difficulty of ""letting go."" Containing some of the most innovative phantasms of imaginative visions suggestive of bits of The Cell (2000), Contact (1997), What Dreams May Come (1998) this finely crafted part horror thriller in the intensely gripping nature of Psycho (1960) as well as elements of the live action adventure of a girl like Spirited Away (2001). This both hard-edged and softly portrayed movie moves in a seductively evil yet heartening way that askews the traditional crime action drama and focuses instead on the psychology of both perpetrator and victim and survivors. Instead of loud and violent, there is calculating and natural or para-natural outcomes that result in balance and normal human healing and discovery.",The Lovely Bones
54,Rodrigo_Amaro,Very good but very difficult to sell and very difficult to accept,9,1 February 2011,"I heard so many bad things about Peter Jackson's ""The Lovely Bones"" that I couldn't believe that a work with such a tremendous cast would be that disastrous film everybody was talking about. Were they right? No, they weren't at all! But I gotta admit that is very difficult to fully accept the concept presented here and some of the moments too, specially the ending, which was awkwardly long, killed the climax and gave one of the worst destinations ever made for a character. Except that it is a very good film with good performances. The story of a young girl (Saorsie Ronan) kidnapped and killed by a psychotic neighbor (Stanley Tucci, wonderful) that, later, we'll be living in a colorful and beautiful place called ""In-Between"", a paradise that is not ""the"" paradise (or heaven if you prefer) while having an enormous difficult to forget her family (because once you're there in this new place you can't go back to the living) and she doesn't want her killer get away with murder. The movie keeps going back and forth with what happened before and after her entrance in this new world made by lots of CGI.Here comes the reasons why this film is difficult to sell: Killings are sad and the killing of young people are even more sad, you start to think that the person had a whole life ahead and things like that. And what this film makes is saying that young girls who are killed by psychopaths go to a wonderful place that resembles heaven, and I'm quoting that only girls because that's what was showed in the film, a paradise of young girls killed. Hold on a minute! We can agree in those terms but only if you've passed through something like that you go to heaven? Who wants to see a film like this that even tries to show something positive with that? The answer is no one. And that's why all this debate over ""The Lovely Bones"" being a good film or not.Another problem was the intersection of genres careless displayed in it. There's drama, suspense, fantasy, and comedy (a short moment when Susan Sarandon appears to move things up in the girl's family after her disappearance). Jackson knows how to deal with fantastic adventures, creating a great drama in most of his films (""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy and ""Heavenly Creatures"") but here I felt that this was like a switch, goes on and off, and depending on your taste in films this might kill the whole experience. For me, when it reached the closure, it was way too absurd to deal, it didn't killed the movie but it could have been better (I haven't read the book in which this was based but I know that there's too many changes and the ending was altered).""The Lovely Bones"" is a different experience, I can't say I watched something similar in all these years watching films, and that's why I enjoyed it. Enjoyed the tension built up every time Stanley Tucci was on screen, he really made the film and deserved a Oscar nomination as a creepy stalker. Enjoyed the 1973 moments with the girl's parents, played by Mark Wahlberg (he's not miscast as many viewers insist in saying) and Rachel Weisz, and the investigation made by the detective (Michael Imperioli). Ronan's performance is excellent, carries the film very well and along with Tucci makes the film very enjoyable. If the CGI hurts the eye a little in its excessive appearance and use, on the other hand the music composed by Brian Eno is one of the most brilliant pieces ever made by a film; it's thrilling, haunting and gives some chills. There's merit in ""The Lovely Bones"" but the ideas are not enough to convince viewers to approve it, like it or understand it. 9/10",The Lovely Bones
55,Floated2,Intriguing story with good visuals,7,25 May 2020,"Now having no knowledge of the novel this film is based upon, only reviewing as a stand alone film. Had no expectations before watching, and once finished, enjoyed it for the most part.Noticed that many of the negative reviews are from those whom have read the novel and are thus comparing the novel to the film. And of course many details appear to have been either missing or different in comparison.The visuals are nice to look at and the acting is solid. Specifically Stanley Tucci as he was nominated for an Oscar for his performance- he most definitely made us feel for the character and was engaging on screen. Saoirse Ronan was also very convincing as the lead protagonist as she was quite young here.Mark Wahlberg as the father was playing more so out of character as he was originally not supposed to play that part. It is noted that Ryan Gosling was originally set for the role but was relieved of his duties a few days prior to shooting. One would picture Gosling being more suited than Wahlberg. Nonetheless, Mark Wahlberg didn't ruin the film.The story does venture on being creepy and disturbing but it also does a good job I'm not making the story gory and horrific. With its PG13 rating, this was held back (perhaps if it was rated R it would have been far more visual and descripted). It seemed relatively tame as it seemed to be marketed towards teenagers.There are scenes of suspense and thrills and the drama is engaging making up eager to see what occurs next.Although the ending was rather disappointing. It was predictable that the antagonist was going to die but his death was rather weak and felt very rushed. Once we see his character leave his house and travel away it feels as if everything wraps up rather quickly.Overall, ended up enjoying the film more than intended to after initially having no interest in watching.",The Lovely Bones
56,Rectangular_businessman,Not bad but not great either.,7,10 July 2010,"This has to be the weakest film of Peter Jackson. Peter Jackson is a great filmmaker who made wonderful films as the trilogy of the Lord of the Rings, the remake King Kong and ""Meet the Feebles"". This must be one of his most personal movies, but it is also one of his most flawed and uneven works. This starts as an interesting drama/ thriller, with some very good performances and interesting characters, but when the subplot about the girl in heaven starts, the whole thing turns just weird and silly. It was still pretty interesting to watch, but not so much as the first half.Even when ""The Lovely Bones"" is not as bad as I have heard, it is the weakest film of the great Peter Jackson.",The Lovely Bones

From this moment, the movie lost all its charm : i'm not into child abuser, the hereafter offers maybe some poetic vision but i find this one pretty absurd, « Cruella » Sarandon was as usual expandable. The best moments of the movie are those of the investigator sister which is really not much for a two hours movie! and maybe a word of praise for Tucci because during all the movie i think it was the other goofy Peter Stormare !!!",The Lovely Bones
58,howard.schumann,Conveys the timeless quality of the human spirit,8,17 January 2010,"Peter Jackson's The Lovely Bones is a tribute to youthful innocence and the resilience of a family in the face of unspeakable tragedy. Based on the best-selling 2002 novel of the same name by Alice Sebold, the film is set in suburban Pennsylvania during the 1970s, recapturing a time of relative sanity in society when people, exhausted by the political activism of the 60s, began to look inward to gain insight into their true nature. Susie Salmon, a 14-year old girl, enchantingly performed by Saoirse Ronan (Atonement), is supported by a devoted family, has a talent for photography, and a crush on an Indian student Ray whom she desperately wants to kiss her.All this comes to a premature end, however, when she is lured to an underground bunker and murdered by sullen neighbor George Harvey (Stanley Tucci) when crossing a cornfield on the way home from school, ending all her dreams of love, children, and career in a brutal instant. As what many mediums and psychics call ""a disembodied spirit, a traumatized soul who cannot let go and move on, Susie narrates the film from a sort of limbo somewhere south of heaven, relating key occurrences of her childhood and the happy days she spent growing up. Sadly, she also recounts the events that led to her death in excruciating detail as the camera dramatizes her words on the screen. Now seeking revenge for her murder, she reaches out to her family from beyond the grave, leaving clues pointing to Harvey as the killer, and stealing a kiss from her wannabe boyfriend Ray Singh (Reece Ritchie).Although the film is particularly skimpy on the relationship between Susie's dad Jack (Mark Wahlberg) and her mother Abigail (Rachel Weisz) and the reason for their breakup, it is solid on several important levels: the trauma of sudden death and the impact it has on a family, the struggle to move on versus the need to get even, and the continuance of life after death. Performances are outstanding especially that of young Ronan who is sweet, innocent, full of life, and a charismatic presence. Equally powerful are the performances of Tucci as the serial killer who is the poster boy for the banality of evil, Wahlberg as the intense father who obsessively seeks the identity of his daughter's killer while criticizing the detective, Len Fenerman (Michael Imperioli) for not doing more to solve the case.Also strong is the reliable Rachel Weisz, Susie's depressed mother who seeks to block the tragedy from her mind by leaving home to pick fruit in California, Rose McIver as Susie's sister Lindsey, an athletic middle school student, and Susan Sarandon as Susie's boozy grandmother who takes control of the household when things begin to fall apart. Unfortunately, the characters are paper-thin constructs that have no life outside of their limited role in forwarding the script.The film has been criticized as well for its over-reliance on CGI effects to depict a colorful, surreal afterlife filled with eye-popping images of bright colorful skies, mountains, and waters where people actually seem to be happy. Jackson's afterworld, however, in my view, is not meant to objectify the hereafter but simply to model Susie's subjective dreamscape, mirroring her purity and innocence as well as her loneliness and agitation in completing her unfinished business on Earth.Though The Lovely Bones has scenes of incredible beauty, it also has moments of brutal violence and a theme of hate-filled revenge that undercuts its message of redemption. Although it does convey the timeless quality of the human spirit, its journey and its purpose with delicacy and intelligence, the film falls short of being a truly magical experience because it does not consider the role of forgiveness and love as an important element in healing, yes even for those who do harm. It is nonetheless a work of sincerity and passion, guided by a director who is willing to take chances to say something meaningful beyond the typical Hollywood product and one who largely succeeds in touching our heart.",The Lovely Bones
59,Tweetienator,Poetry in Motion Pictures,9,23 September 2017,"The Lovely Bones is the right movie if you like fantasy, melancholy, and experiments, Jackson's work is a very fine balanced mix of fantasy, drama, and thriller: a dead girl must find her way to find peace and let go of the past, a family in despair trying to cope with the loss and trying to find the body of her missing daughter. And there is, of course, the question if the killer will get his punishment.Mr. Jackson, of course, knows his business and the cast (Rachel Weisz, Mark Wahlberg, Saoirse Ronan, Susan Sarandon, and Stanley Tucci as the sicko) just plays fine and touching. Also, the scenes playing in the afterworld are fine crafted eye-candy.Some viewers seem to feel offended by the mixture of child-abuse and -killing and the redeeming part of the after-world scenes, I personally don't see it that way, for me, The Lovely Bones is poetry in motion pictures. If you like to watch touching and emotional movies, this is one for you, you will get the whole range of human emotions: sadness, loss, anger, despair, happiness, love.

A bludgeoning of melancholy for over 2 hours, Jackson proves that no matter how visually beautiful you make something, there needs to be more underneath it. The afterlife and supernatural elements are beyond frustrating; rules are non-existent, and the ""philosophy"" is like a freshman college student who just read Aristotle for the first time. Tucci is bad, Wahlberg is REAL bad...it's all just bad.",The Lovely Bones
61,Movie_Muse_Reviews,"Spiritual world element of ""Lovely Bones"" meddles with the human factor",5,9 June 2010,"An indistinctive stew of genres best describes Peter Jackson and Co.'s attempt at adapting the Alice Sebold novel ""The Lovely Bones."" Part murder mystery, part family drama and part Salvador Dali painting, the film suffers an epic identity crisis which it hopes to mask by drowning you in evocative symbolism.Susie Salmon (Saoirse Ronan of ""Atonement"") is a 14-year-old who is murdered by a neighbor and finds herself observing the ensuing events in her family's life from ""The In- Between,"" a purgatory she is stuck in until both she and her family can learn to let go and move forward. Susie's lingering spiritual presence in the real world allows her to give her family some unfounded suspicions toward the man who killed her, Mr. Harvey (Stanley Tucci).When no legitimate reason exists for a character to behave a certain way other than some sixth sense they have, it's tough to buy ""The Lovely Bones"" as the solving of a murder. The first 30 minutes of the film have enough emotional pull that we want Mr. Harvey to get busted pretty badly, but it's terribly unrealistic.The fantasy element of Susie existing in the in-between where the climate/environment around her changes constantly is an over-reaching metaphor that you couldn't care less about. Jackson's team makes this world a lot more visually impressive than films such as ""What Dreams May Come,"" but the foundation of the story lies in the real world, the hook and crux of it at least. The symbolism of the gazebo Susie stands on to watch her family and the cornfield present themselves quite obviously, but the script provides little motivation to analyze them. The rest of the Salmon family dealing with the aftermath on the real world plane is far more interesting.The existence of two worlds permits Jackson to intercut a lot of scenes of one world with that of the other. Some of these scenes impress, such as Susie's father (Mark Wahlberg) smashing his collection of bottled ships in anger at her death while Susie sees large bottled ships crashing and shattering on the shores of the In-Between. The scene where Susie is eventually killed lasts close to ten minutes as well as it's intercut with what her family is doing at the time. Like much of this film, sometimes the technique works beautifully, other times it's executed until tedium.The surrealism quality and dual nature of the film keep it from achieving its metaphoric and symbolic goals with regards to death and moving on. Despite superb direction and visual effects, the elements are not seamless enough, try as Jackson might to link scenes together constantly. Emotional symbolism can never fully replace logic and the In-Between is presented to us without any clarity of rules. ""The Lovely Bones"" should have been a moving family story, not a scattered piece of art with family elements.~Steven CVisit my site http://moviemusereviews.com",The Lovely Bones
62,lisafordeay,Very underrated film,7,7 June 2021,"The Lovely Bones is a 2009 supernatural thriler directed by Peter Jackson( best known for The Lord Of The Rings,The Hobbit and the 2005 remake of King Kong) with an all star cast from Saoirse Ronan(Brooklyn),Rachel Weisz(The Fountain),Mark Wahlberg(The Fighter),Susan Sarandon(Enchanted) ,Rose McIver (A Christmas Prince)and an unrecognisable Stanley Tucci(Maid In Manhattan), the movie centers on a 14 year old girl named Susie Salmon(Ronan) who was murdered in December 1973 by her next door neighbour George Harvey(Tucci). While her family(Sarandon, Weisz,Wahlberg and McIver) are still struggling with Susie's death,Susie is actually stuck between heaven and earth as she wants to inform her family that she was loved and she knows her actual killer.Overall this film was actually very good. I have to give props to Stanley Tucci for playing the killer in this film. He was so sinister and so sly your skin will be crawling when you see his intentions. Saoirse Ronan was great in this film as the deceased teen her American accent was spot on. Mark Wahlberg was great as Susie's father along with Rachel Weisz as her mom.

63,jtindahouse,A thought-provoking film with one big element that I didn't like,6,15 March 2018,"About five or so years ago I had a go at reading 'The Lovely Bones'. I got about halfway through and decided it just wasn't for me. I like more of a mystery thriller than a book where everything is on the surface and it's more about dealing with the situation. I could see why people were so fond of it though. It was compelling and original. For some reason it's taken me this long to get around to seeing the movie. As a movie, I really enjoyed it. My gripes with it come from a logical point of view. Allow me to explain.My problem with the concept comes from the fact that the film very clearly puts forward that there is a God. Now that's all well and fine, after all thousands of films have done that over the years. Where my problem lies is that the movie demands there is a God, but also says he is willing to sit dormant while a child murderer/rapist leads a great life. I probably could have gotten past this gripe with the film if it wasn't for a scene near the end that really bothered me. It's during the death of said murderer/rapist. We see an icicle hanging from a tree, and as if a Devine intervention had come to be, a lightning bolt of sorts hits it and drops it on him forcing him to fall brutally off a cliff. The lightning bolt I speak of is the single worst part of this film. It implies that a higher power had the ability to do something all along and chose not to. I didn't like that at all.That aside, the rest of the film I quite enjoyed. I understand that they left a lot of things out from the book to make it more teenage friendly, and to me that was a shame, because the film could have been something great with those in it I suspect. Still, the film decided what it was and stuck to it, so fair play. There's some thought-provoking dialogue and it is a film that will stick with you after the credits roll. Life is a fragile and precious thing, and that fact can easily be forgotten. Film's like this remind you that life is short and needs to be cherished. Any film that does that is worth watching in my opinion.",The Lovely Bones
64,Turfseer,Clever special effects can't save laughable tale of teenager's demise and sojourn through limbo-like netherworld,3,5 December 2010,"The 'Lovely Bones' reminds me of the film 'Ghost' in that the protagonist has been murdered and now exists in a limbo-like nether world. In both films, the protagonist has 'unfinished business' not only in terms of resolving conflict with a principal love interest but also ensuring that the person who murdered them gets his just desserts. In Ghost, Patrick Swayze's 'Sam Wheat' is tormented by the fact that he never told girlfriend Molly that he loved her. He gets that opportunity at the end of the film when he inhabits the body of Oda Mae Brown, a spiritualist. Similarly, in the The Lovely Bones, Susie Salmon is tormented by the fact that she never got that first teenage kiss from Ray Singh, her handsome Anglo-Indian high school chum. Susie also gets to inhabit someone else's body, in this case Ruth Connors, a neighborhood girl who also possesses psychic powers. But whereas the relationship between Sam and Mollie is decidedly developed and resolved in a quite satisfying manner, the resolution of Susie's angst over the missed kiss is nothing more than mere puppy love.Ghost is also far more satisfying in terms of drama since Sam actively pursues his killer by tormenting him through various means including levitating inanimate objects in his direction . He also communicates with the living, aided by his trusted ally, Oda Mae. Susie, on the other hand, can do little to bother her murderer, George Harvey (the twisted serial killer, well-played by Stanley Tucci). Occasionally she startles him (he catches a glimpse of a shadow inside his garage which appears to be that of Susie riding her bicycle). And when Susie finally does get the opportunity to communicate with Ray, instead of telling him to warn her parents about Harvey, she is merely content to obtain the kiss she missed out on before she was murdered.Susie is truly stuck in limbo since she has no external arc to resolve. Her conflicts are not with the survivors on earth but within her own mind. In addition to obtaining the kiss from Ray, she also must face the reality of the nature of her demise. Director Peter Jackson pulls out all the stops with his CGI effects, depicting Susie's gradual triumph over her own fears, taking in the history of Harvey's murderous forays. Jackson is perhaps most creative when he offers up the nightmare scene (a la Stephen King) where Susie learns of the fate of each of Harvey's victims.Even if one is impressed with all those beautiful special effects in the nether world, the machinations back on earth are strictly soap opera. There is not enough space to catalog the absurdities of the Lovely Bones plot, but I'll mention a few here: 1) Instead of phoning the police, 14 year old Susie, who obviously doesn't know how to drive, plays hero by driving her brother, a choking victim, to the hospital; 2) Harvey constructs an underground den in a clear field and no one notices what he's doing 3) Susie is missing a scant few hours but instead of waiting for the police, her father runs outside, hands out flyers like an idiot, believing that somehow that's the best strategy for finding his missing daughter; 4) Susie's father, who has been hounding the investigating detective for not doing a good enough job in finding his daughter, delays the investigation by not developing all of Susie's film all at once. Instead, he wants to 'honor her memory' by developing one roll each month at a time; 5) Instead of staying with her children like a normal mother, Susie's mother, Abigail, abandons the family and goes off to pick fruit on a fruit farm; 6) Grandma Lynn (played by an over the top Susan Sarandon), can think of nothing better to do but drink copious amounts of alcohol while the family needs a strong parental figure to hold things together; 7) Susie's vigilante Dad goes after Harvey with a baseball bat despite having no evidence whatsoever (except a hunch) that he's responsible for his daughter's murder; 8) Harvey somehow loads that heavy safe into his car and makes a fast getaway but later can barely drag the safe with the help of another man a few yards where he finally disposes of it in a ditch.Perhaps the most ludicrous part of the plot is sister Lindsey's decision to break into Harvey's house where she finds the incriminating journal. How can Detective Fenerman possibly go after Harvey since the evidence was obtained illegally? After learning that Lindsey had broken into Harvey's house, wouldn't he have been obligated to arrest her? And wouldn't the journal have been inadmissible evidence in a court of law? Certainly no Judge would have given Detective Fenerman a search warrant to enter Harvey's house on the basis of illegally obtained evidence! In the end, The Lovely Bones has the dubious distinction of turning the story of the murder of a 14 year old girl into a comforting tale of reassurance. The full horror of the murder itself is reduced to a series of creepy Stephen King-like horror scenes and the victim somehow 'triumphs' when she finds the courage (in an illusory limbo) to overcome her fears at looking at the reality of her demise. Further reassurance comes in the form of a comeuppance for the evil serial killer. Unlike the book where the killer is not apprehended, nature (or even God perhaps) conveniently has an icicle drop on the shoulder of the villain, where he is promptly dispatched by falling over the side of a cliff.Despite the clever special effects, for those who are not completely convinced of the overall ludicrousness of this flick, please consult the IMDb message board under the topic, ""100 things we've learned from the Lovely Bones Movie"". It's a thread that should leave you in stitches!",The Lovely Bones
65,Chris Knipp,Heaven can wait,6,17 January 2010,"Saoirse Ronan (an Oscar nominee for her supporting role in Atonement) is excellent as 14-year-old Susie Salmon, a Pennsylvania schoolgirl murdered by a serial killer in the early Seventies in this inexplicable and overblown adaptation of the Alice Sebold bestseller. Peter Jackson has drifted a long way from his early study of wild young girls, Heavenly Creatures. He's too addicted to grandiose productions now, from the Rings Trilogy to King Kong, to adopt a style suitable to the delicate details of this story about adolescent longings and family sorrow whose beyond-the-grave narrative blends supernatural thriller and police procedural. A.V. Club writers Keith Phipps and Scott Tobias have suggested the Scottish filmmaker Lynne Ramsey (Ratcatcher, Morvern Caller) ought to have done it. True: working small with a keen understanding of a young person's mindset as Ramsey might have done is clearly what was needed to make something you'd remember out of this material. Instead this elaborate production is all over the place and nothing subtle or distinctive has survived it.In the novel, the girl is already dead and narrates events before, during, and after the crime from an in-between realm where she's lodged because she's not ready to move on to heaven yet. And here is where big trouble starts. What's mainly just a narrative voice in the book becomes in Jackson's version a distractingly overproduced greeting card location combining Hallmark images with those used as the opening signatures of certain American movie production companies. Susie just needs to linger on till some loose ends get tied up, such as the grief of her parents and the need for her killer to be punished. (In the book he also raped her but the movie chooses to omit that detail. This is a surprising change given that rape is an important part of novelist Sebald's own experience and figures prominently in two of her three novels to date.) Susie also needs to follow around Ray Singh (Reese Ritchie), a boy at school who asked her on a first date the day she was lured to her death. She wants to have that first kiss she missed in life. And Ray, with his teased-out hair and nice jacket, is indeed a real Seventies honey. One way the elaborate production is successful and fun is its Seventies look. There's even something appealingly Seventies about the police investigator as played by The Sopranos' Michael Imperiali.Stanley Tucci is appropriately creepy, unrecognizable in a wig and unlike any character he's played before as the serial killer George Harvey, who goes unnoticed at first because he's a near neighbor. The other cast members come across as only slightly above TV movie-of-the-week level. Mark Wahlberg is one-note earnest and anguished as the father, Rachel Weisz bland and wasted as the mom, Susan Sarandon briefly amusing but unnecessary as the ""quaintly"" alcoholic visiting grandmom who comes to ""help"" when Susie disappears. Sarendon's best sequences are, typically, just a quick but over-dressed collage: the movie gives us a barrage of images to deal with, many of them unnecessary. Even Saoirse Ronan's omnipresent voice-over, for all its conviction, is insufficient to hold things together. Events get so complicated and are run through such a relentless visual blender that the creepiness gets mixed up with the sweetness and it all starts to turn creepy.Where the movie goes over the top is in its elaborately staged and excessively drawn-out pseudo-Hitchcockian cross-cutting sequences that alternate excruciatingly to the point of exhaustion between one scene and another, starting with a back-and-forth between the vividly sick-making sequence of Harvey luring Susie into his underground lair beneath a cornfield and the sweaty one of her worried family at home having an uneasy dinner. But the editing tricks begin long before that, blending in scenes from past and present, action sequences with flashed-in Instamatic shots by Susie the camera bug, giving us so much more than we need to see and so much less than we need to feel.The practical problem the screenplay must confront is that we know early on who the killer is, and the only uncertainty is when he'll be detected. Suspense is generated by having Susie's younger sister Lindsey (Rose McIver) break into Harvey's house, not knowing where he is. Jack (dad Wahlberg) also gets suspicious and confronts the bad guy, another edgy scene. Finally, however, reality seems increasingly not to matter as events get ever more complex and unnatural, ending in a sequence when Harvey and a dump attendant roll a heavy metal safe toward a sink hole, as we watch Ray and a new girlfriend watching them and Susie jumping in and out of the real world from her purgatorial perch. Harvey might have driven up closer to that hole and made moving the safe over to it a whole lot easier and faster, but that would have made the process too brief for the cross-cutting with other locations to work out. All this contrivance, when surely what matters is the anger and sadness, which somehow must take second or third place.The movie is not unwatchable; it's enlivened by Saoirse Ronan's conviction and depth. Wahlberg works so hard at being a sweet bereaved dad it's endearing at times, even though he's never quite real. But The Lovely Bones is sucked down into its own sink hole when the finale grinds out an unsatisfying end for the villain mixed with Susie's long delayed exit amid choirs of angels and big screen Hallmark. In retrospect this movie is a collage of scenes that could be from many different movies, none good.",The Lovely Bones
66,freemantle_uk,Lacked the Darkness the film really needed,8,23 February 2010,"On paper The Lovely Bones should have everything going for it: it was based on a popular book that was critically received, directed by one of the most respected men in the business, has a great cast and tackles a number of themes, child murder, grief and the after live. Dreamworks was so confidence of this they pushed back it's release date so it could compete in the awards season. Sadly did this not work out for them.The Lovely Bones tells the story of Susie Salmon (Saoirse Ronan), a 14-year-old who lives a typical 1970s suburb of Pennsylvania. She lives with her loving family, her parents Jack and Abigail (Mark Wahlberg and Rachel Weisz), younger sister Lindsay (Rose McIver) and younger brother Buckley (Christian Thomas Ashdale). Susie aspires to a photographer, started to fall for Ray Singh (Reece Ritchie). But on 6th December 1973 she was murdered by her neighbour George Harvey (Stanley Tucci). When Susie dies she is stuck in a limbo, the Inbetween, unable to accept going to Heaven. From the Inbetween she watches her family as it starts to fall apart because of the grief and seeing her murder avoiding being a suspect. She starts trying to break through, trying to comfort her family and help lead them to her murderer.If you have ever read The Lovely Bones you will see that it was particularly an unfilmable novel, mixing gritty-real life subject matter with wide metaphysical issues. This film was originally attached to Lynn Ramsay, a British director famous for doing low-budget films before going to Peter Jackson. Jackson should be a safe pair of hands, he adapted the Lord of the Rings trilogy, an ultra-detailed epic, and handled a film with similar martial, Heavenly Creatures (a film I really need to see). For the most part Jackson shows his skill, showing how the Salmon family coping with the initial grief of losing Susie and his love for special effects. He shows a good mix of real-life events mixed with heaven. But this is not Peter Jackson at his best. He makes some errors which he really shouldn't have had. He took out a lot of the darkness that the film needed. It was dealing with serious subject matter, and the original script had darker moments, like when Susie first realises she had been killed she is in Mr. Harvey's bathroom and she picks up his razor blaze to kill him. In the novel Susie was raped and murdered, and Jackson should have shown more: I'm not suggesting that an film-maker should show a child/young teen being raped, that is cinematic suicide, but the camera could have been their for the fatal blow. In novel, the family dog also found Susie's elbow, the only part of her body that was ever found. Jackson played it too safe and he should have gone for a 15/R rating. Jackson misjudges the tone, making the film a little too light, and Susan Sarandon's character Grandma Lynn was really no in tone, having her as slapstick comedy folly. Jackson also misses out some keys scenes, that were even in the original script, like Abigail's affair with Len Fenerman (Michael Imperioli), the investigating officer. The film does skip large portions of times as well, which affects the film. But all the story elements are fairly well done, and makes for compelling viewing. I hope their is a Director's Cut to expand it.The film's winning feature is the cast. Saoirse Ronan was terrific as Susie Salmon and she should be winning a Oscar, but she hasn't even been nominated. You can really feel for her. Stanley Tucci was also excellent as the unsuspecting killer, and has been nominated: but Christoph Waltz would properly win. Mark Wahlberg should now be on the road to recovery after his year of disaster in 2008. He was very good as a grieving father. Rachel Weisz too was very good, and showed a different type of grief. Besides Grandma Lynn being very misjudged as a comic character Susan Sarandon was still good a chain smoking, heavy drinking grandmother. The editor, Jabez Olssen, should have also been nominated for an Oscar.A problem that this film was always going to face was it's depiction of heaven. Jackson tried to play it safe, by having Susie in limbo and not proper heaven. In the novel Susie went straight to heaven, even having a counsellor to help her adjust. I suspect Jackson's move was to prevent upsetting Christians in America, but I say sod that because it was also meant to be a personal heaven. In the novel Susie's heaven was more understated, it was physically a high school where she lives a teenage fantasy and had other people in it. Jackson ended up making Susie's heaven too grand, like Susie's and Holly's fashion parade on a giant record player. But Heaven is never easy to depicts because everyone has a different view of a perfect world, whilst everyone does have the same primal fears like pain, torture and fire which makes depicting Hell a low easier.Overall, a decent attempt, about 7.5 out of 10, but The Lovely Bones really needed to be darker. I think a director like Darren Aronofsky or Danny Boyle may have been better suited.",The Lovely Bones
67,dfranzen70,"Pretty, boring package with lackluster acting",4,12 January 2010,"A murdered teenager watches from Heaven as her family tries to sort with the reality and consequences of her death. Not really meant to be an uplifting movie anyway, this adaptation of an Alice Sebold novel is almost relentlessly depressing, overbearing, maudlin, and dull. It's a movie that demands considerable emotional investment, but it takes too long to reach its conclusion, leaving you cold when you should be concerned.The movie opens shortly before Susie Salmon (Saoirse Ronan) is killed by a creepy neighbor (Stanley Tucci) in 1973 and then finds her stuck in limbo while her family deals with the tragedy. She is also keeping an eye on Mr. Harvey, her killer, in the hopes that someone will catch him and find her body. But just so you're aware, this is not a murder mystery, since we know almost immediately who the killer is; it's a melodrama about how people cope with loss.So there's very little intrigue to be found, and every little plot development seems to exist merely to move things along to some undefined conclusion with which you may or may not agree. Dad Jack (Mark Wahlberg) copes by lashing out (at items he built with his daughter, not at his family); mom Abigail (Rachel Weisz) opts for escape; sister Lindsey (Rose McIver) escapes as well, out of Susie's shadow. Even Abigail's mother, Grandma Lynn (Susan Sarandon) shows up to lend a hand to a family reeling - the fact that she's a chain-smoking, liquor-swilling wild woman gives everyone a jolt, but it's just not enough.Critics have said that Sebold's novel is probably unfilmable, and they're right. Director Peter Jackson uses some startling visual imagery, but it's really nothing noteworthy (and, truth be told, What Dreams May Come, which covered some of the same subject matter, was far more visually interesting); worse, everything feels jammed in, a square peg desperately trying to fit into a round hole.But worse than that, for me, was the interminable, uncomfortable scene in which Susie is abducted by Mr. Harvey. There seemed to be no good reason to drag this interaction out as much as Jackson did, other than to make everyone squeamish. Since the thrust of the movie was the Salmon family's reaction - and Susie's experiences in the afterlife - showing us a drawn-out attack scene felt gratuitous and had me eyeing the exit signs.As for the cast, Wahlberg and Weisz try their best but are overshadowed by the constant shots of Ronan attempting to convey an emotion of some sort. Ronan, who was terrible in Atonement and mildly improved in City of Ember, is given little to do other than look pitiful. Sarandon chews scenery as a vamping lush of a grandma. The only one who shines is Tucci, who's almost unrecognizable as the bespectacled blonde killer.Peter Jackson's The Lovely Bones is stylish but insubstantial. While the effects are fun to look at and feel full of meaning and import, the story and acting feel almost tacked on as an afterthought. This is problematic when the movie relies heavily on the story to begin with, because it makes the low-key character-driven scenes look even worse in comparison.",The Lovely Bones
68,meeza,Stanley Tucci is one hell of an actor!,8,30 July 2010,"Director Peter Jackson's ""The Lovely Bones"" is not for everyone to digest easily. It fixates on the most heart-wrenching situation that can happen to a family, child abduction & murder. The film's story is told through the narration of its victim protagonist, Susie Salmon. She was abducted and murdered by the creepy-king neighbor George Harvey when she was just 13 years old. Susie takes the elevator upstairs to the picturesque pre-heavenly ""in between"" and that is where Jackson places her throughout most of the film as she narrates her tragedy and the uncertainties of the afterlife. The first act of ""The Lovely Bones"" bones home (whatever that means) to the Salmon Family before Susie was murdered until right up to the point of her murder. The school of Salmons are comprised of architect dad Jack, housewife mom Abigail, jealous-sibling sister Lindsay, and little brother from the same mother (and father for that matter) Buckley. The Salmons are your average run-of-the-mill suburban American family. And Susie is your average run-of-the-mill freshman teen whose mind is primarily focused on jumping (what is to her) the lovely bones of school senior Ray Singh. OK, I am exaggerating. She just wants a smooch or two from that Singhado. Ray takes a liking to Susie, but before you could say ""Ray & Susie went up a hill to a gazebo to fetch some flirty chatter"", the monstrous Harvey strikes Susie. The second act of ""The Lovely Bones"" joints the Salmon family dismay in dealing with Susie's death, Harvey's longing to strike again and avoid the authorities, and Susie hanging in the ""in between"" afterlife observing what is happening to her family from ""almost heaven"" above. I think you will crush my ""not so lovely bones"" if I play spoiler and provide you info on the film's third act, so I will stop my own narration. ""The Lovely Bones"" excelled in highlighting the horrifying violence that is child abduction; an act that is totally unforgivable, no matter how many loose wirings are unattached on the perpetrator's cerebral functioning. Stanley Tucci's masterful performance as Harvey was disturbing to the max, as it should be when one is playing that disgusting of a character. Saoirse Ronan did a formidable job as Susie, even though she was not ronan with the acting tide in the shallow romantic scenes. But she will not leave a ""Saoirse"" taste in your mouth with her splendid subjective narration and experience from up above. What was not so lovely of ""The Lovely Bones""? Mark Wahlberg might have just hit the acting wall with his overdone Salmon work as vengeful dad Jack, and it was probably not a Weisz move for Oscar winning actress Rachel Weisz to play such a monotonous character as mommy Abigail. And I wish that grandma got run over by a neighbor in seeing Susan Sarandon's exaggerated showy role as the boozy grandma coming to save the grieving day. Director Peter Jackson is the lord of the visual scenes when it comes to displaying a CGI heaven or earth in his films; and make no bones about it that in ""The Lovely Bones"" he shared the same vision as in his past landmark films. But why did he and his screen writing team of Fran Walsh and Phillipa Boyens have to incorporate such a fictional pretense romance between the older-looking Ray and the childlike Susie? It was close to being as creepy as the Harvey character. I know it's in the best-seller book the film was adapted from, but one does not have to do it by the book all the time. Nevertheless, I do give the screen writing team some props with its crucial dialogue of the cautionary tale aspects of the feature. ""The Lovely Bones"" might be bad to the bone to many with its uncomfortable subject matter; but Tucci's acting prowess is the film's exemplary achievement, and as disturbing as it is, no one should have a bone to pick with him for his well-deserved Oscar-nominated performance. **** Good",The Lovely Bones
69,MaxBorg89,The afterlife according to Peter Jackson,8,20 November 2010,"From the onset, The Lovely Bones was a tricky film to pull off, not just in itself, but also because it marked the first time in years that Peter Jackson laid his hands on a smaller project, compared to massive undertakings like The Lord of the Rings and King Kong. However, it also seemed like a movie right up his alley, due to its rich visual content and a thematic resemblance to his early hit Heavenly Creatures. The mixed critical response and lack of substantial Oscar nominations (an inevitable parameter given LOTR's overall awards collection) suggest the director misfired. In reality, The Lovely Bones, while flawed, remains indelibly his, and that constitutes a strength and a weakness at the same time.Based on Alice Sebold's acclaimed, partly autobiographical novel, The Lovely Bones is the story of Susie Salmon (Saoirse Ronan), a 14-year old girl living in small-town America (the time is early '70s) who one day ends up being killed by her secretly psychotic neighbor, George Harvey (Stanley Tucci, whose relentlessly creepy performance scored the film's sole Academy Award nomination). Stuck in a sort of Limbo, she goes on to observe the police (here represented by Michael Imperioli's Detective Fenerman) failing to come up with any proper leads and her family - siblings, parents (Mark Wahlberg and Rachel Weisz) and grandmother (Susan Sarandon) - struggling to move on, with the old man in particular being determined to crack the case no matter what.Due to the story's supernatural overtones and Jackson's eye for spectacle, much of the attention from critics and moviegoers alike has gone to the sequences depicting the afterlife, and justifiably so: determined to depict something different from the usual cinematic portrait of heaven, the director and his effects team have pulled off a very personalized world, by turns enchanting and nightmarish, reminiscent of Heavenly Creatures and its protagonists' flights of fancy. Jackson is clearly in his element here, delivering a compelling mix of human drama, fantasy and horror (although a PG-13 rating means the more shocking material, including any mention of Susie's rape at the hands of Harvey, is omitted).Once the focus shifts to the actual plot, though, cracks start to show: the entire final act, albeit faithful to the source material, feels and looks corny, and some necessary trimmings to secure an acceptable running time (135 minutes) have caused Weisz' character to be practically pointless, while Sarandon is the center of an ill-judged comedic montage that, despite being pure Jackson (weird comedy is in his blood), jars with the overall tone of the picture. Fortunately, affecting performances from Wahlberg and the staggeringly perfect Ronan (plus the aforementioned Tucci) keep the film on track most of the time, providing a largely consistent emotional background.In short, this may be sub-par compared to Jackson's most recent accomplishments, but The Lovely Bones remains a solid, moving piece of filmmaking with enough strength to remind us that its director is still one of the finer visionaries of contemporary cinema. Then again, it is a joy to know his next project is The Hobbit...7,5/10",The Lovely Bones
70,dar0417,Havne't read the book,4,5 March 2020,So sad a young girl dies and even more sad I stopped caring halfway through the movie. If for some reason you finish this movie the ending is brilliant. I think this film is based on a novel for the first time ever I am recommending the book over the movie. Keep in mind I haven't read this book.,The Lovely Bones
71,NateWatchesCoolMovies,Stunning work of beauty,10,7 February 2016,"Peter Jackson's dreamlike adaptation of The Lovely Bones gets unfairly beat down way too much. While I will concede that, having never read the book myself, I've heard it differs considerably in story, I view the film on a standalone level. And what a film. It's an absolute stunner, on every level, from effects and casting to acting and production design. It contains elements of the subconscious and astral planes which are a huge draw in any film for me, and are visualized here spectacularly. Saoirse Ronan plays Susie Salmon, an adolescent girl barely coming into her own when she is cut down like a flower that has just begun to bloom. Her killer, a skin crawling creep named George Harvey (Stanley Tucci) is a neighbor and well disguises his inner nature, making the search for her murderer lead to cold dead ends. Her father (an oddly cast Mark Wahlberg makes it work) doesn't give up for a minute, tormented by not knowing what happened to his little girl. Her mother (Rachel Weisz) and grandmother (Susan Sarandon) slowly come apart at the seams from the insidious trauma that such an incident inflicts on loved ones left behind. Only her plucky sister Rose (an excellent Rose McIver) is able to find any clues which lay the blame on Harvey. She quietly scopes him out for proof of the murder, providing a scene of hair raising suspense that will leave you needing a change of pants. Meanwhile, Susie finds herself in a place beyond space and time, a dazzling purgatory filled with the sights, sounds and memories of her short life all projected through the abstract prism of the unconscious mind, and is simply the most innovative and eye opening look into the unconscious dream world of the human being since Tarsem Singh's The Cell. Ronan is a beacon of hope in her performance, projecting resilience frayed with the vulnerability of a young soul achingly wounded at the tragedy of her outcome, yet determined to set things right and make peace with the life she was ripped out of so soon. Tucci is flat out genius as Harvey. Gone is his usual spitfire camaraderie, giving us an empty, psychopathic shell of a human with a reptilian gaze that causes shudders all round. He's made Harvey a truly harrowing movie villain to rank as one of the very best, and when viewed alongside other performances of his, one can scarcely comprehend his versatility, let alone believe it's the same guy in both roles. Peter Jackson has a yearning for every project he takes on to be the longest, flashiest, most opulent vision he can conjure up, and while that sometimes causes his own masterful technique to buckle in on itself a bit, here its employed wonderfully to make the very best version of this story that anyone probably could have. He also doesn't shy away from showing the blunt brutality of the situation, or the undeniably ugly event, which is hard to sit through yet necessary for the arc of the story to have full impact. In the end, elements of the story both nasty and uplifting alike combine with a set of impressive visual effects and earnest acting all across the board to create a treasure of a film.",The Lovely Bones
72,3xHCCH,Unsettling But Worth The Trip,7,6 January 2010,"This is another movie I watched because of the awards hype around it at this time. This Peter Jackson movie is very hard to describe without going into spoilers. I watched it without knowing what it was all about, and I think that was good for my experience.The topic of a serial murderer of children could never be pleasant. This movie was told from the point-of-view of the latest victim, a 14 year old girl named Susie Salmon (Saoirse Ronan), as she speaks from her afterlife. She talks about her short aborted life, her murderer (a sinister different-looking Stanley Tucci), and her family, as we are regaled with PJ's imaginative computer-generated view of limbo.I found the movie engrossing and suspenseful despite its depressing subject matter. This is more of the director's achievement to deliver such a story in an evenly-balanced manner, with childlike innocence. I liked the criss-crossing scenes of afterlife and reality as Susie comes to grip with what had happened to her. The editing in these scenes is masterful.I felt the film is flawed though. I was looking for more family interaction after Susie's death, but there wasn't that much. Big name actors play her parents (Mark Wahlberg and the beautiful Rachel Weisz) and kooky grandma (Susan Sarandon in a scene-stealing role). But I felt they could have had more to do than what was shown on screen. I must confess that the ending may also not sit well with everyone. I was disappointed to find out what Susie's soul decided to do at the end.Because of the morbid and unsettling nature of the story, this story is not for everyone. But for those willing to share this vision of life and death by Peter Jackson, I think it can be worth the trip.",The Lovely Bones

75,aharmas,Destroying Beauty,9,17 January 2010,"Peter Jackson, contrary to a good number of people's perception started his career with small and quirky films, some of which would probably shock people who attend cult, midnight screenings. It was exciting when he decided to go after this novel, and his interpretation is much, much better than another film out there, currently getting accolades for changing its source material and compromising the main character's true nature. Here, things remain pretty much the same as they are in the source, especially the horrible nature of the crime. This is an element that appears to disturb most people, and it certainly is hard to sit through a movie when the performances are top notch.Saoirse Ronan is spectacular in her performance of a young girl who becomes another victim in a serial killer's long list of crimes. Up to the moment the crime happens, this young actress gives one of the best performances by a teenager in history. She glows as she interacts with the other fine performers: Mark Whalberg and Rachel Weisz are warm and supportive as the people whose lives are just about destroyed by the disappearance of their firstborn. Susan Sarandon shows up to provide some tension relief as the well meaning but disturbed grandmother. There is much love of life in this family, and it's Roman's reading that makes the audience understand the degree of the loss. When Tucci starts circling, we dread the ultimate outcome and wish it was different, but then there would not be a movie.Next we follow Ronan's exposure to a place that might either be limbo or the young girl's interpretation of what the road to heaven might be. As we can see, she is not done with her business to her earthly existence, and as she contemplates her options, we follow her younger sibling's investigation to find out who is truly responsible for her sister's death. There are some very tense moments as this business is resolved; what takes center stage is a point most people might be find contention: how much of what is happening in the real world is affected by Ronan's actions in limbo? There seems to be a connection, but it is never quite explained.There is much to be admired here, and some people might find what is on screen not quite what their philosophy matches, but it must be remembered that this is Ronan's vision and own transition period. In reality it is not much different from the twisted motivations that trigger Tucci's killer's actions. He is compelled by dark forces. Ronan's after world takes on the same bright shades her living personality had. It's sweet, fantastic, full of wonders, and hopes.Jackson takes personal themes and displays them in a larger canvas. He makes uses of special effects to take us in that spiritual ride. He intentionally places that much distance with the difference of styles in the movie, from the realism of the early scenes there is a huge difference between the pain and sorrow the family goes through, and the peace and beauty the victim experiences.In the end, we get the resolution the audience wants, and the spirit of the movie remains true to its original source; nothing has been diluted and compromised: love keeps you going and might eventually save you. There are highs and lows and circumstances might change depending on people's own perspectives about what the outcome is, but in the end is all about being able to move on, with a little spiritual help.",The Lovely Bones
76,Jonny_Numb,Jackson's Lament,5,24 January 2010,"One of the pleasures of watching a director ascend the ranks from low-budget features to the world of big-budget event films is the artistic growth witnessed over time. Peter Jackson, the New Zealander responsible for such tastelessly brilliant fare as ""Meet the Feebles"" and ""Dead Alive,"" has carried those familiar stylistic quirks into films like ""King Kong"" and even the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy. With ""The Lovely Bones,"" Jackson makes his first foray into straightforward drama since ""Heavenly Creatures"" (which I haven't seen), and while the story (based on an Alice Sebold novel) seems ripe with potential, the execution is jarringly uneven.The year is 1973. Susie Salmon (Saoirse Ronan) is a 14-year old girl growing up in a Pennsylvania suburb with her father, Jack (Mark Wahlberg) and mother, Abigail (Rachel Weisz). Almost immediately, Susie's voice-over narration conveys to the viewer that she has been murdered, and is speaking from a quietly reflective middle-world somewhere between Earth and Heaven. After school one day, Susie is accosted by George Harvey (Stanley Tucci), a seemingly innocuous neighbor who is also a child murderer.To call this subject matter ""despairing"" would be an understatement, and had Jackson (along with co-writers Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens) plumbed the depths of darkness that such a sensitive subject calls for, he would have created one of the most painful, harrowing, and affecting films of our time. There is greatness within ""The Lovely Bones,"" but (much like Susie) it's trapped between two competing worlds: on one end, we have the modestly dynamic Earth/Heaven hybrid that Susie inhabits, full of stunning wonder, visual beauty, and heavy-handed metaphor; on the other, we have a world of real-life domestic despair, as a family attempts to cope with the unthinkable. At 135 minutes, ""The Lovely Bones"" has more than enough time to flesh out its intentions, characters, and motivations, but somehow never does–in fact, the whole film feels underdeveloped to the point of frustration.While there is nothing wrong with Jackson's usual penchant for dazzling visuals, the overall effect is considerably less profound than it was in, say, ""King Kong."" Similarly, the wrenching emotions the story calls for only appear sporadically. For a film intended to chronicle the conflicts associated with tragedy, grief, and, finally, acceptance, ""The Lovely Bones"" is crippled by episodic character arcs, dictated by a script that apparently insists that everyone play a narrative placeholder first and a skewed caricature second, with little room for realism in the mix (Susan Sarandon's comic-relief grandmother being the most questionable inclusion of all). Ronan and Tucci come close to breaking through, but even their efforts are hampered by clunky aesthetic choices (her melodramatic, self-referential voice-over; his unexplored psychological demons).As ""The Lovely Bones"" progressed, these accumulated observations left me feeling manipulated and disillusioned. Here is a film that (for a little while, at least) touches upon a tough, seemingly unapproachable subject with grace and curiosity, only to pull out convenient narrative cheats that erode the impact of what has gone on before. And that's the real tragedy here.4.5 out of 10",The Lovely Bones
77,questl-18592,The Bones Aren't So Lovely,2,16 February 2021,"Weisz. Ronan. Sarandon. Tucci. A lineup like that immediately got my attention and the description sealed it. I was pretty stoked for this... Until I actually watched it. The Lovely Bones is a movie all about concept but the delivery is a complete mess. There are some fantastic visuals here, stretches of cinema that are really something to watch but everything else here feels so forced and fabricated, with the exception of Tucci. Stanley Tucci and his makeup team really managed to create someone that was legitimately disturbing and creepy to watch.Never have I watched a movie that had me so frustrated with the sound design and music editor. The music is so overblown, so melodramatic that it feels like it was ripped straight from a soap opera. It's the perfect example of this films problem. There's so much forced drama here and none of it ever feels earned. It always comes off like a bad Lifetime movie with a budget rather than the emotional tale it thought it was. The ending sealed it too. No spoilers but the way this ends was almost cartoonishly bad and it really left a rotten taste in my mouth.A movie with this cast and this concept really deserves to be better and the fact that it's not is supremely disappointing. I give it slight props for visuals but the rest of this was just obnoxiously manufactured. Pure aspartame sweetness, the kind that never tastes quite right and never satisfies. I want to say there's something here, some redeemable factor that makes this worth checking out but I really don't think there is. The best part, the only real solid stuff for me was the visuals and I think you'd be better off just googling clips rather than actually watching it.",The Lovely Bones
78,valleyjohn,A religious free Heavenly movie,9,11 March 2010,"I don't believe there is such a thing as Heaven. When we are dead , we are dead.

Don't get me wrong , i love the idea of there being a heavenly place when we go to when we die , where we meet our friends and family who have gone . The lovely Bones is a wonderfully thoughtful movie that explores what happens to a young girl after she is murder and passes over to the place between heaven and Earth. Director Peter Jackson teams with longtime collaborators Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens to adapt author Alice Sebold's best-selling novel concerning a murdered young girl who watches from heaven as her family attempts to cope with their devastating loss, and tracks her killer as he stealthily covers his tracks and prepares to claim his next victim. I have read some very disparaging reviews about The Lovely Bones , so i wasn't quite sure what to expect but what i did get was a superbly acted film , with a story that had me gripped as well as it emotionally twisting me inside and out. Everyone who is a parent knows that the worst possible thing that can happen to them is the death of their child . I really don't even want to think about the idea of that happening but Alice Sebold has come up with a story that is told from the point of view of the deceased and it brilliantly done. I have read criticism that the novel was far to difficult to put into film and that Peter Jackson failed in his attempt but i have not read the book and i love this movie. What i like is that there is not one mention of religion in Sebold's heaven and if that's what heaven is about then i might just start to believe.

79,SnakesOnAnAfricanPlain,The Lovely Bones (2009),4,13 September 2012,"Blow me! This has been a real good year for disappointing cinema and talented directors falling flat on their face. The Lovely Bones is a mess of a film. It seems as though Jackson and Walsh have randomly torn pages from the novel to adapt, rather than creating a sensible and decent motion picture. It jumps awkwardly from scene to scene, with Jackson relishing the fantasy afterlife sequences and blowing his cinematic load over the dark thrillery parts. This results in an incompetent handling of what should be the main focus, the family scenes. I seriously couldn't care for this poorly developed family or the situation they had found themselves in. Tucci gives a good performance, even if Jackson does insist in always covering him with creepy shadows just to make sure we realise how evil he is. Let's hope for a decent remake, as I swear there's a great film in here somewhere.",The Lovely Bones
80,aimless-46,"""the world without me in it""",8,8 August 2010,"""The Lovely Bones"" is based on Alice Sebold's hugely popular 2002 novel of the same title. Like almost all adaptations it takes some liberties with the source novel's story, but I think it manages to preserve the essence; so that you feel the story more even if you do not understand it as precisely. Unfortunately most of the comments and reviews are rather useless for anyone thinking about viewing the film or for someone looking to better understand what they just viewed. So here are a few random points to consider.The film is basically a blend of ""The Dust Factory"" (2004) and ""Speak"" (2004); with elements of ""Silent Hill"" (2006) and ""What Dreams May Come"" (1998). If you like that type of stuff you should get off on ""The Lovely Bones"". If this sort of story is not your cup-of-tea there is still enough quality acting and imagery to make it time well spent for a technical film buff.As in the novel, the entire story is told from the point-of-view (POV) of 14-year-old Susie Salmon who became the victim of a serial killer. The main character tells her story in flashbacks and subdued voice-over, as she observes the world from a personalized transitional realm between earth and heaven. Looking into the world much like the penguin in the family's snow globe, as her grieving family tries to cope with her death and her brazen killer goes largely unnoticed.The distanced voice-over gives Susie more dimensionality; her calm tone is often contradicted by what is happening in the frame and it contrasts nicely with the shallow (but normal) teen qualities of her character before death. ""Depth"" is an important symbolic element in the story, which is full of juxtapositions between closed places (sinkholes, basement, a compartment under the floorboards, dollhouses, ships in bottles) and bucolic vistas. There is an especially effective montage early in the film as the editor cuts back and forth between the trapped Susie and her unsuspecting family at the dinner table; with each cut Susie looks smaller and younger.""Atonement's"" Saoirse Ronan plays Susie, and her subtly expressive performance elevates the film to ""must see"" status. A young actor this instinctively talented and effortlessly charming only comes along about once in a decade, and rarely are they matched with a role this perfect for them at a particular point in their careers. Ronan should have a lengthy and very successful acting career but it is unlikely that she will again play a character that is such a perfect physical and emotional fit. For serious film buffs this is one of those historical moments.Ronan's performance transcends the genre, unexpectedly causing the film to work as a very affecting coming-of-age story. Susie clings to a living world that is lost to her in much the same way that Georgia Lass did in the ""Dead Like Me"" series, and in the process experiences things that positively change her, even after her death. Allowing her to reconcile things and to even appreciate ""the lovely bones that had grown around my absence"" as she comes to terms with ""the world without me in it"".Director Peter Jackson chooses to emphasize her in-between world with a lot of expressionistic special effects visuals. While this was not a point of emphasis in Sebold's novel, film is a visual medium and these provide an opportunity to introduce symbolic connections between the two worlds and to showcase Susie's journey. Even more importantly, Jackson nicely fills the frame with Susie's innocent features as she bravely navigates her strange land with looks of wonder and on occasion looks of terror. Using a 14-year-old girl amplifies the emotional power of this stuff, it simply would not have been as effective with someone a different age. Lurking beneath his psychological thriller storyline, Jackson steers the film toward a rather deep allegorical take on an existential theme. It explores the isolation of someone as they realize that they no longer belong in the world.I am not a Peter Jackson fan; his films, from minimalist efforts like ""Heavenly Creatures"" to exercises in excess like ""King Kong"", have never really connected with me. And he was probably not the ideal choice for a film like ""The Lovely Bones"". But his only real misstep here, the insertion of Susan Sarandon's comically overplayed grandmother into the middle of the story, was not significant enough to be a fatal flaw. And another director might not have chosen to emphasize the process of Susie growing stronger, which I found to be the most appropriate emphasis for a practical adaptation of the original story.Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.",The Lovely Bones
81,ctomvelu1,CGI-laden fantasy,5,22 November 2010,"This one's tough to review, as I have not read the popular novel. Those who have read it, tend to intensely dislike this adaptation. What I did see was a supernatural thriller (minus the thrills) about a murdered girl watching over her family from a sort of way station that leads to heaven. She also watches over her killer, a seemingly mild-mannered neighbor played by the always marvelous Stanley Tucci. We spend a lot of time in CGI land here, which deeply offended lovers of the book. I am not a CGI fan, book or no book, so the CGI scenes did nothing for me. I am painfully aware of who directed this, and his love of (or obsession with) CGI. Anyhow, the young actress who plays the dead girl is appealing, and the cast is peppered with familiar names, like Susan Sarandon and Mark Wahlberg. The film heavily focuses on the killer, which I understand is not the way the novel read. As I said, a tough one to review under the circumstances.",The Lovely Bones
82,Matt_Layden,It's Not The Mess People Say It Is.,6,13 May 2010,"Susie Salmon was 14 when she was raped and murdered. Instead of going to heaven, she is in the in-between. She is there to watch over her family through the grieving process and to somehow bring her killer to justice. Let me say right off the bat that I have not read the book, but I understand that a lot of the hate towards this film is the fact that Peter Jackson didn't get the emotion right and he left the important stuff out to focus on the magical world that is the in-between. While I can't attest to this, I can sort of see their point, even without reading the novel. The story is easy to follow, but near the end becomes a bit cloudy with it's purpose and message. The film is far from perfect, but it is not the mess that people say it is.Jackson loves his CGI and he uses it beautifully here, but it does seem to be overbearing. A lot of the in-between scenes are nice to look at, but they don't hold any emotional resonance with the viewer. We get that it's a wonderful place where you can do what you want, but we are shown this too many times. It took away from the more interesting story that was the family. Mark Wahlberg and Rachel Weisz are the parents of Susie, normally I find Wahlberg to be too monotone and passive in his voice. I did not think he was going to be able to pull off the emotional requirements for this character. He didn't knock it out of the park, but he did surprise me. Weisz is the mother who cannot go on living in the house. Her husband is obsessed with the case and finding the murderer, her mother is an alcoholic and she needs room to come to terms with her daughter's death. The film doesn't explore the emotional weight enough for these two characters. We see they are upset, obviously, their daughter is dead, but I wanted them to dive deeper into their characters. It unfortunately wasn't the case here. The film itself isn't sure what it wants to be, is it fantasy, is it a film about solving a murder case? It mixes both and yet doesn't feel like either. The obsession of the father is just one quick scene and we are to believe that he comes to a realization of certain events based on, I'm assuming, Susie willing him to. Far-fetched, but believable in some small ways. Stanley Tucci is the killer, this is no spoiler as it is all over the trailers. He is haunting in this role, his blue eyes are cold and steel like. His kind and warm hearted demeanor only adds to his tormented cruelty. Both Susan Sarandon and Stanley Tucci were excellent in their roles. Don't forget about Saoirse Ronan, after all if we don't like her why do we care? She was excellent and made the film better by her innocent and young portrayal of the victim. There are certainly some suspenseful scenes, Jackson knows how to get an audience to hang on to the edge of their seats. Jackson uses his camera in unique ways to give and uneasy feeling at times. The shots looking through the doll house are great, as are the extreme close ups of random objects thrown on dutch angles. The Lovely Bones isn't without it's problems. The film concludes with mixed messages and a lot of questions. Did she stay to see her killer brought to justice, or to kiss the guy? Does that girl live in that shack near the sink hole? Why did the film have random transformation possession scenes. None of it is really explained. She ends with film with some narration about the connections made in her death, yet I failed to see any. In the end I did enjoy it though, it is shot beautifully and I was engaged in the story. The film is receiving a lot of heck, so I'll be in the minority and recommend it.",The Lovely Bones
83,pc95,All Over the Place in a Bad Way,3,13 November 2010,"""The Lovely Bones"" starts out fairly well and we the audience are given some important details of the story up front in the first 20 min or so. However, the movie fragments all over the place after the setup. Lord of the Rings director Peter Jackson completely blew this movie up. It's music video scenes become more and more out of place and at some points you're wondering if you're watching a fantasy movie, an episode of the Wonder Years, or a gore-fest murder mystery. By the end of the movie our patience was sliced thinner than paper, and the final narration remarks pretty much make you gag. This movie needed some clarity and focus in the worst way. It's trying so hard to be several genres in one, the proverbial 2 feet in 2 different boats. Not recommended at all.",The Lovely Bones
84,lewiskendell,"Good, but fans of the book will find it a little lacking.",7,22 April 2010,"In any movie that's adapted from a novel, there will always be changes made to the screenplay to accommodate the change in medium. The Lovely Bones is no exception, and anyone who has read the book will notice these changes immediately. The question is, how do these changes effect the overall quality of the movie version?Some of the alterations work well. The Lovely Bones was a dark novel, and it deals with some very uncomfortable subject matter. It was hard enough reading the circumstances of Susie's death; it would have been twice as bad to actually watch it. The PG-13, sanitized version of certain events was a wise choice, in my opinion. There's also an intentional focus on the (admittedly impressive) visuals of Susie's in-between heaven. Peter Jackson's involvement with the project makes a lot of sense, considering the astounding special effects used to give visual substance to the book's fairly abstract descriptions of the afterlife. Some scenes are absolutely beautiful.Saoirse Ronan is easily the best actress of her age, and she's the perfect Susie Salmon. It's ridiculous for someone so young to be as good as she was in some scenes. Stanley Tucci has the important task of bringing to life the second most important character, George Harvey. And wow, does he! That Academy Award nomination was well deserved, because he made George Harvey into a man that makes your skin crawl. The rest of the cast is decent, but they never really get to develop in the way that they do in the novel. Which leads me into the aspects of the film that I wasn't as pleased with. The whole point of The Lovely Bones (and the meaning of the title), is that Susie's death laid the framework for the course for the lives of those affected by it, for years. The movie focuses on a much shorter portion of time, and a lot of the characters were hurt by the absence of crucial plot lines. Ray Singh and Ruth (who are incredibly important to the story) were reduced to minor characters. The movie's ending isn't nearly as strong as the book's, as a result. Buckley is also written as little more than a background character, while Jack's obsession with finding his daughter's killer is not given the depth or desperation that I think it should have been.Greater than all those issues, though, is the alteration and omissions of nearly the entire character arcs of Abigail and Lindsey. You barely get a glimmer (if that) of Abigail's relationship with her mother, Mrs. Singh, and Len Fenerman, and these were MAJOR parts of the book. And Lindsey (who's life was changed by Susie's death more than anyone else) is reduced from being the emotional anchor of the story, to a mere device to keep the plot moving. I understand that sacrifices for time have to be made in adaptations, but I'd much rather the movie have been 30 minutes longer and include some of these story lines. That would have turned a good movie into a great one. And it is good, despite my complaints. Most of the things that I missed, won't be much of an issue for someone who hasn't read the novel. Like I said before, the special effects are amazing. Even though story is altered (a.k.a. watered-down) a good bit from its original form, there's still a lot left of what originally made it so good. There's no heavy- handed lesson and very little of the sappy, contrived garbage that normally infests movies of this kind. This isn't a young adult novel or a Lifetime movie of the week, and if that's what you're expecting, you should watch something else. For everyone else, The Lovely Bones is an imaginative story of the effect the dead have on those they leave behind, and vice-versa.",The Lovely Bones
85,bob-rutzel-1,"Sad, Touching, Heartbreaking",7,9 November 2010,"Susie, (Ronan) a young teenager is murdered by Mr. Harvey (Tucci) and she watches her family cope from a place between Heaven and Earth. She is most worried about her father Jack (Wahlberg) who can't let go. What is difficult for someone who has died is to provide clues to the living to help find the murderer. The promos have you believe that is the case here. Not so entirely, however that does happen, rather obliquely, toward the end of the movie which is to say, the clues aren't all that compelling. There are two things that are hard to reconcile in a short movie: the family coping with the death of a daughter and sister; and the hunt for the murderer. I think adequate time was given to both. However, I don't recommend this for small children. The story is a good one, but the real winner here is the cinematography. We see Susie caught between Heaven and Earth and the scenery by on-scene photography and also by CGI is simply overwhelming. What you will get is a vivid visual treat for the eyes. Some of the best cinematography I have ever seen. Ms Ronan may be a force to compete with Dakota Fanning and Abigail Breslin. She was perfect. Mark Wahlberg was good, but the length of his hair was a distraction. He was like a long-haired teenager married to a 28-something woman. Looked awkward. Susan Sarandon as Susie's grandmother is becoming almost hard to recognize as she really gets into her character and that is a good thing. Rachel Weisz was good, but somewhat underused. Michael Imperioli was in sync with his Police Detective role. But, the best performance was by Stanley Tucci as the murderer (You know this from the beginning so no cat was let out). It's difficult to give praise to a character playing a pedophile, but he really did a great job.There was nothing uncomfortable in here. Almost so, but nothing graphic, or lurid. This was, at times, very sad, touching and heartbreaking so keep a box of Kleenex handy. Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: No.",The Lovely Bones
86,MartianOctocretr5,Bones crushed by tons of CGI,5,4 November 2010,"Fran Walsh's original manuscript was touching and heartfelt; and some but not enough of the beauty of her work survived through the filter of this film's overindulgent CGI. It's a vision of the after-life, in the vein of What Dreams May Come or 5 People You Meet: someone dies violently, and faces unresolved issues left over from their life from a quasi-heaven existence. Like those two stories, she meets those who preceded her in death, reflects on memories of her happiest and saddest moments, and watches over the living. Saoirse Ronan as the young Susie Salmon, victim of murder, is sensational. Her performance is touching and believable; you can feel the conflicting emotions she is struggling with as she watches her family and her murderer. The director burdens her with over-use of narration; but Ronan's earnest delivery makes it at least tolerable. It's an obvious crutch device used by Peter Jackson in place of dramatic action. He also deluges the screen with an onslaught of overblown CGI that detracts from bringing the author's vision in the source material to the screen. The supporting cast, especially the vile serial killer, are superior. But again, the director regulates them to supporting roles of running around weirdly and doing stupid things in front of green screens. The whole thing had a feel that Jackson was trying to be M. Night Shamalyan's 6th Sense, but that was lost somewhere between that gazebo and the cornfields. Even though you'll feel like you've been nuked by the way overdone CGI, at least CGI isn't a WMD. If it was, we'd all be joining Susie Salmon real quick.",The Lovely Bones
87,SusieSalmonLikeTheFish,Really good story but too much CGI,7,27 July 2014,"The Lovely Bones was a beautiful movie, with some very sad but at the same time awe-inducing events. It takes place in the early Seventies and is a movie about growing up, death, coping with the loss of a loved one, pedophilia, family matters and the possibility of heaven and hell. Instead of the same old Jesus stuff the ""heaven"" is actually a psychedelic jumble of earthly items placed in an otherworldly atmosphere. 14-tear-old Susie is the oldest child in a family of six: her mom, dad, grandma, brother and sister. She has a dog and lives in Pittsburgh, and has three school friends: a boy named Ray, a goth girl named Ruth who is seen as crazy by most other kids and her preppy friend she hangs around with constantly. One day she cuts through a deserted field after school a week or so before Christmas and meets Mr. Harvey, a kindly and docile man who bears a close resemblance to Flanders from the Simpsons at first but quickly turns creepy when he rapes and murders her, sending her into the abyss of the afterlife where she meets a Vietnamese girl who secretly knows that Susie isn't Harvey's first victim. This was no doubt a spectacular film, but there were a few flaws. First of all there's the way some things don't fit with the decade it was supposed to take place in. The character Ruth would at that time be labeled mentally ill for the way she acts, wearing black nail polish and saying she hears and sees ghosts, drawing naked people everywhere and such. In the 1970's her personality would be difficult to accept in society. Also the soundtrack was beautiful, but really didn't suit the mood of the 70's, nor did the tons of CGI and green screen used in the movie. Also it cut out very major points in the book, like the affair between Susie's mom and Detective Len, and Ray and Ruth's relationship. Still, this movie is worth your time, if you ever come across it don't hesitate to watch it!",The Lovely Bones
88,Troy_Campbell,"A longwinded, tonally disjointed movie.",4,29 December 2009,"Lovely Bones is a longwinded, tonally disjointed movie from Peter Jackson. Going from sweeping fantasy to cat-and-mouse thriller to psychological drama, the only thing you can be sure of is that you aren't supposed to be feeling good. Whilst there are some relatively powerful moments – a scene where all the girls murdered by the same man meet is noteworthy – overall it is badly edited and contains too many scenes that fall dreadfully flat. The apex of its failures appearing in an embarrassing interaction near the end between Susie and her crush Ray (Reece Ritchie); fortunately by that point you're used to the crassness.Taking two years in post production due to the overwhelmingly intricate computer effects of the 'in-between', Lovely Bones offers up a delicious platter of grand CGI images for your eyes to feast on. The highlight is an awe-inspiring segment with gigantic glass bottles containing ships smashing against the rocks. The only issue is that these phantasmagorical treats lose their varnish due to being randomly inserted among other scenes with a completely different vibe.Shame about the muddled, mediocre screenplay because the acting level is quite high from all involved. Mark Whalberg is possibly the standout, his obsessed father the most likable and believable character of the lot thanks to his passionate performance. The young Saoirse Ronan (Oscar nominated last year for her role in Atonement) is certainly one to follow; her portrayal of Susie is fantastic, especially considering she was only 13 during filming. Stanley Tucci, Susan Sarandon and Rachel Weisz all turn in solid supporting parts, even if Weisz's character grinds on the nerves.A couple of jaw-dropping special effects sequences and an impressive cast save this from becoming the biggest flop of the year... just.2 out of 5 (1 - Rubbish, 2 - Ordinary, 3 - Good, 4 - Excellent, 5 - Classic)",The Lovely Bones

91,pyrocitor,Skeletal,6,28 January 2010,"If making a film about a child's rape, murder and the ensuing inevitable trauma, grief and healing would not have already been a delicate enough matter, the added pressure of adapting it from a bestselling and cherished novel would be enough to send any director into hysterics. Fortunately, with the impeccable credentials of the Lord of the Rings trilogy, his King Kong remake and particularly earlier drama Heavenly Creatures (also profiling young girls beset by tragic circumstances and an inventive 'fantasy world'), appointed director Peter Jackson appeared perfectly poised to tastefully handle the poignant emotional complexities as well as aesthetic possibilities of Alice Sebold's harrowing The Lovely Bones. Instead, tragically enough, Jackson's usual intrinsic understanding of his source material appears largely absent, his film, while shining at times, predominantly floundering under the weight of creative missteps and faulty handling of the content. To its credit, the film begins very well, tastefully introducing the myriad of central characters and their various quirks, and managing to evoke the beautifully bittersweet feel of Sebold's novel through Jackson's flighty cameras, perpetually lingering just out of reach and playfully capturing the the largely joyful events, juxtaposed with Susie Salmon's baiting voice-over crafting a steadily amplifying sense of fatalism and dread. Similarly, Jackson demonstrates a near peerless knack for setting up and amplifying tension, and his treatment of Susie's murder is just as jarring, horrifying and unbearably captivating as it should be, while carefully avoiding sensationalizing the subject. However, it is after the death of Susie that the film's more problematic regions begin to rear up.While Sebold's novel concentrated primarily on the effects of grieving and troublesome first steps towards moving on, both on the part of the deceased Susie and her earthbound family, Jackson's script gears more towards a confusing semi-empathy, semi-demonising exploration of her murderer, Mr. Harvey, or indulging in special effects inundated explorations of Susie's 'in-between' after death realm. As such, between the ambiguous stance towards the antagonist (ambiguous in the sense of Jackson seemingly not knowing how to present him rather than an intentional ambiguity breeding character complexity) and the Salmon family feeling largely sidelined, reduced to one-note secondary characters in lieu of scenes detailing Harvey brooding or Susie serenely dancing on over-sized record players or walking through pastel coloured liquefying fields, the narrative feels perpetually unbalanced and at risk of collapsing inwards upon itself. The film's ending feels particularly rushed and cluttered, struggling to resolve countless largely abandoned loose ends from the novel, and overall breeding a feeling of even greater emotional disconnect. With such an emotionally rich text which drew strength from its interconnected web of complex characters as inspiration, to have the film dart uncertainly between subplots, never fully committing to any or properly 'getting under the skin' of the characters in the way Sebold's novel did feels a particular shame, and the viewer is left consistently alienated and cold, unable to sympathize with the trauma of such shallow, unconvincing characters and unable to derive a conclusive 'point' to the events transpiring through such a jumbled telling.While the heavy focus on visual effects has been a substantial source of contention against the film for many, the problem is not so much the volume of CGI as it not being rooted to any definitive motivation. Susie's 'pre-heaven' is undeniably gorgeous and impressively integrated into a believable state by Weta Digital, yet such dreamy interludes appear forcibly shoved into the film for entirely superficial purposes, for the sake of showing off a pretty and imaginative alternate world. Never does the audience share Susie's delight or ultimate alienation in her transient state, but instead the interludes into her world simply add to the fragmented disconnect of the plot and further distance from the crucial emotional centre to the story. Even Brian Eno's score feels inconsistent, varying between suitably drifting, ambient themes to disappointingly conventional suspense or tragedy cues where a moodier, more abstract dirge would have worked wonders. While the impressive cast try their hardest, most are left floundering to pick up the slack of incomplete, thinly written characterizations. Saoirse Ronan is the highlight as quirky, high spirited and tragically murdered Susie Salmon, beautifully and devastatingly moving from joyful exuberance in regards to the wonders of her after-death world to self-righteous fury at her murderer's continued, unpunished existence. Mark Wahlberg is similarly strong as her father Jack, blending impish charisma with haunting, bleeding tragedy and aimless fury towards his daughter's murder and demonstrating rarely seen impressive dramatic skills. The normally stellar Rachel Weisz, however, is nothing less than a colossal disappointment as Susie's mother Abigail, matching the unforgivable under-writing and trivializing of her very complex character with an equally flat and unemotional performance, making the grief segments after Susie's death particularly unaffecting. Stanley Tucci, doing his best to redeem an almost comical 'rapist stereotype' mustache, glasses and combover combination, ingeniously makes murderer Mr. Harvey all the more chillingly abhorrent through a disarming charm rather than wallowing in awkward sexual offender clichés, and while he similarly extracts an uncomfortable empathy for a disturbed man, he still fails to ultimately deliver a fully credible take on the role. Susan Sarandon, while enjoyably chewing scenery as Susie's alcoholic grandmother, feels uneasily at odds with the rest of the film, particularly her comedy 'taking over the household' montage immediately after Susie's horrifying murder. The rest of the supporting characters, fully fleshed out and realized individuals in the novel, are reduced to utterly forgettable two dimensional placeholders, another profound disappointment. Overall, there remains a perpetual sense of Jackson not fully understanding his picture of choice, through faulty creative decisions and frustratingly mishandled emotional storytelling. Nonetheless, while the dashes of quality might prove disheartening, hinting at the picture which might have (and easily could have) been, they ultimately give Jackson's The Lovely Bones enough buoyancy to not be an outright disaster, but rather a tragically mishandled, merely passable shadow of a potential triumph.-6/10",The Lovely Bones
92,oneguyrambling,Jackson creates a beautiful mess.,5,14 November 2010,"If there is one thing that The Lord of the Rings trilogy showed us, it is that sometimes you just get lucky with the source material.The Lord of the Rings trilogy was so ready to be made into a great film series that I now believe a dozen other directors with a budget, passion and time could have done a great job and come up with something almost as good as what we now have, if not better.Sacrilege you might say Fanboys? Well please answer this: What else has Peter Jackson made that was worthy of any more than a middling review? I liked The Frighteners but would never call it vital. His early stuff was more notorious than celebrated, and the less I talk about King Kong the better. In fact, the second best film on PJ's record was made only last year, only by a different guy, that was District 9.What I will concede is that Peter Jackson is capable of putting amazing visuals on the screen, but he doesn't seem to know where to stop or how to tell a story, which is why Return of the King was 40 minutes longer than it needed to be and that King Kong was basically a series of trailer highlights without a decent story to bring them together. (Need I mention here that the LOTR trilogy was based upon one of the more celebrated series of novel in history? Didn't think so.) Which brings us to The Lovely Bones, also based upon a successful novel (apparently, I haven't read it), so as long as Jackson sticks to the story he can run wild with his pretty pictures and a good film is a cert. Right? Not really.To summarise TLB in one sentence is easy: The spirit of a young murdered girl looks down from heaven and watches as those left behind after her untimely death deal with daily life without her.(Given that the young girl Suzie acts as the narrator and informs the audience in the first three minutes that ""I was fourteen years old when I was murdered December 6 1973"", I would argue that this fact couldn't be included as a spoiler.) To expand even a little further is very difficult, as there are so many competing points, none of which add much or seem that much more important than the others, which brings me back to my bitch about Peter Jackson: Sometimes you need to cut stuff that doesn't matter, and make the stuff that does seem more important to the story.The Lovely Bones seems well acted and includes many different characters who waft in and out of the storyline, never seeming to demand attention or to do anything of great significance after the initial events. Despite having (Marky) Mark Wahlberg, Rachel Weisz and Susan Sarandon Mark Wahlberg and Rachel Weisz are the young parents left behind after their daughter's abduction and untimely death in the early 70s, along with their surviving daughter and son. All of the traumatic repercussions are touched on after they realize that Suzie is indeed dead, but they seem glossed over.Wait up I'm stuck again here.I want to cover the various things that happen only I can't decide which are important enough to include without ruining the film, and I keep coming back to the fact that they are simply events or actions, and that none of them seem important to moving the story along or memorable enough to say ""you need to see this scene"".The Lovely Bones is a genre-identity problem. It isn't a comedy and has no action sequences, isn't a whodunit as we are told that very early on and despite having a murder at its core it isn't so much a revenge fantasy or a crime procedural.It is an undramatic drama. For some reason I kept recalling a 90s Robin Williams film called ""What Dreams May Come"" that I watched once, didn't think much of, and couldn't help but feel that the problem was it had no home.The Lovely Bones I think wants to be a grandiose and deep exploration of death and the impact it has on those left behind, (again I only think), but it seems a mish-mash of ideas that never grabs your attention by identifying what the film wants from the audience in the first place.It is visually spectacular at times, especially in the ""afterworld"" sequences where Suzie (and Peter Jackson) can let their imaginations run wild.But visuals alone don't make a great film. Even great and talented actors can only do so much with the material and screen time that they have, and if the guy pulling the strings doesn't keep things moving in the right direction all we are left with is a pretty mess.Final Rating – 5.5 / 10. I know Peter Jackson has another great film in him. First he needs to align himself with a great scriptwriter - and a more brutal editor.If you liked this review (or even if you didn't) check out oneguyrambling.com",The Lovely Bones

The audience waits intently for the murder to occur, something I truly dreaded...But, the whole 'supernatural' element ruined it...The special effects became over-bearing and actors like Susan Sarandon was not needed...Who seemed to provide the so called laughs, in a serious, tragic film.The end is weak, and does not give the film any closure...We, watch as Susie's sister finally has evidence in her hand, in the form of a note-book of the killer, she rushes home and sees her mom, and then she witnesses a reunion between her parents and then Susie's sister decides to not reveal what she has found....Only to be questioned by her grandmother...I thought that was ridiculous...Overall, a lavish, over blown special effects feature which does not do justice to the darker subject of the film.",The Lovely Bones
94,antoniotierno,very good and original job,8,17 February 2010,"This Peter Jackson's adaptation of Alice Sebold's best seller is a courageous and original film, with a 135 minute running time that is carried very lightly. The director gets to squeeze in a teen romance, a portrait of the serial killer, a family falling apart story, as well as an expressionistic after-life fantasy. All these multiple plates spin successfully, due to the daring and original film-making style and due to the strong acting performances (Susan Sarandon being excellent as well). The themes of murder are combined with the fantastical one, with the after-life vision and an impressive flower iconography.

""The Lovely Bones"" is part murder-mystery narrated by the victim who tells us who the killer is, and part grieving and loving family. Or at least that is what the story is supposed to be.The love of family part failed since they did not introduce us to three-dimensional characters, and we didn't really get to see the family grow or accept anything. The film made a number of changes from the book it is based on, some of which were good choices as I found the 'murder-mystery' part of the story flowed much better.The story is supposed to rely on the visuals of the afterlife. I found that most of the images in the film were very odd choices because it was very different from how I pictured it in the book. But I think that is part of the beauty - to see someone else's interpretation of the unknown.The story is done well enough, even with basically no characters to get invested in, and then all wrapped up in sweeping visuals of Heaven and the Inbetween. Although my Heaven would be different, this is probably a must see for people who get swept away with illustrations. But a definite pass for those who like character-based films.",The Lovely Bones
96,Stampsfightclub,Skips finer book details but watchable heavenly drama,6,4 August 2010,"A young girl named Susie Salmon (Saoirse Ronan) tells the story of how she was murdered and the troubles that followed for her family.What first attracted me to this film was the trailer. A passionate montage compiled of artistic direction, shallow music and a sad different plot. The fact it stars some of Hollywood's biggest names and has the Lord of the Rings director at its helm made it all the more intriguing.Based on Alice Sebold's controversial novel the film follows pretty much in sync with the plot's routine, if occasionally sidestepping the more provocative points. If you have read the book, and enjoyed it, you may find this adaptation a bit whimsical, somewhat of a misjudgement on the emotional core of Sebold's work. If you are a neutral looking for a good drama with an interesting outlook on life and death this may have you gripped until the very end.The story unveils itself in a slow manor, getting away a lot slower than its source. As a technique Jackson has implemented Susie more into the lives of her family at the beginning, generating the family relationship and then unfolding the murder from there where the book was a more shock start grabber of Susie already being dead. The use of memories was strong but we see more of Susie in her heaven and the current time continuum unlike the novel. To me this was a good idea as the book was often quite jumpy. Overall however the plot is good enough an adaptation with the issues of murder there, if the team have skipped over the rape sequence, but generates a good dramatic viewing.With so many big names on show it was a gamble choosing an unknown for the lead. Ronan to her credit nails the essentials of her protagonist if the more dramatic sequences beat her and the family quarrelling she possesses as much bite as a smartie.Susan Sarandon is a stand out with not nearly enough screen time, Wahlberg looks funny but has a good representation of his character's struggling façade. Weisz is hardly featured but above all else it is an unrecognizable Stanley Tucci who steals this film.He will creep the living daylights out of any viewer. With his careful approach to track covering it is a very slight worrying that George Harvey's representation of a murdering paedophile is so believable.As before the scenes involving the murder cuts the core and many have said destroys the entire point of this release but the power to shock is maintained.Jackson delivers a consistent film with his choice of fantastical elements for heaven. The quickly changing sceneries are great and the rough Earth drama is always watchable.Whereas this film may skip away from its source there is a good fantasy element with a few strong performances that shall upset fan's but maybe indulge neutrals.",The Lovely Bones

Deep and richly developed characters helped round out this sometimes depressing yet engaging story surrounding the murder of 14-year-old Susie Salmon (""like the fish""), and how she views her afterlife ...and looks on as her family attempts to deal with her disappearance.Sebold incorporated a ton of information that was crucial to our understanding within the Salmon household, and the community as a whole. But much gets lost in translation. This isn't too much of a surprise, as Hollyweird requires directors to cut-cut-cut so that movies run shorter and thus can be shown more often (i.e., a three hour movie will only show about three times in a day, whereas a two hour flick jumps up to five a day).Peter Jackson took on a major task here, but nothing compared to his LORD OF THE RINGS series (which I found to be brilliantly done, by the way). But Jackson is more of a visual artist. Which was wonderful for Middle Earth fans. But for fans of a story that has such a heavy character background (like this), I think he floundered a bit. In place of story, we get more stunning visuals. Although I didn't mind them (in fact, I found them wondrously eye-catching), it did tick away precious seconds and minutes that otherwise could've been put toward the characters. Fans of the book will be highly depressed to learn that there's nothing in here regarding adultery, and a time-line that is skewed so that we have a more warm and fuzzy ending. Entire characters are removed (including an Indian neighbor), while others are moved around to fit an obviously tightened time-frame for the film.Still, THE LOVELY BONES is entertaining. The special effects/green screen visuals will have your mouth hanging open. And Saoirse Ronan (ATONEMENT) as Susie is played exceptionally well. But if you're going to watch it, you'll probably love to hate Stanley Tucci (JULIE & JULIA) as the sick and weird George Harvey, Susie's murderer. When he lures her into his trap, you can feel the skin prickling on the back of your neck. Tucci's Best Supporting Actor nod at the Oscars last year was well-earned.If you haven't read the book, much of what I said here probably won't mean anything. But if you have ...well ...beware.",The Lovely Bones
98,Hollywood_Yoda,Peter Jackson Wasn't Nominated?,9,30 September 2019,"I was surprised to learn after seeing this film that Peter Jackson, the director was not nominated for an Academy Award. It's a great film, well directed and craftily written. For a 135 minute feature, this film holds your attention. And Stanley Tucci was great in this film; he was nominated but didn't win!Outside of the Lord of the Rings/Hobbit films, this is one of Peter Jackson's best film adaptations by far. A sad, yet intriguing story about a young girl who is murdered and watches over the killer and her own family. The ending was depressing, I won't say why, so that you'll watch for yourself.",The Lovely Bones
99,joebloggscity,Melancholic yet beautiful film on a grim subject,7,27 July 2011,"Supposed to be a great book, but I've not read it. Coming to this film cold,I didn't know what to expect. Jackson is most famous for his CGI fantasy films (Lord of the Rings, King Kong etc) and this is another but grounded in people and spirits rather than monsters.Film centres on a film coming to terms with the death of their young daughter, and the father's obsession to find him. However, the girl may be gone but she is still overseeing them in spirit, and this is the crux.It's not the first of its kind, and there have been other films in this genre, esp by Gullermo Del Toro who specialises in these fantasy films. For a change, we have one in the English language and it's a fair stab.However, it can be quite slow-paced, although was never meant to be a thriller. Despite the grim subject matter, it's never too much to handle and the director & writers have done a fair balancing act not to teeter between beauty or grimness.It's beautifully shot, the acting is great and the special effects aren't overwhelming.A long film so be prepared. It's no classic but interesting and beautiful. Most will enjoy the film, so I'd say you should give it a try, you could be pleasantly surprised.",The Lovely Bones
100,ajs-10,A good effort... But the book is better (I'm afraid)...,6,24 November 2010,"I have now read the book by Alice Sebold, with the same title, on which this film is based, and so I thought I'd give it a second viewing. In my first review I looked at the film as a stand-alone piece of work, now, having read the book, will I see it differently? Here's a brief summary first before I give you my thoughts (summary haters please wait in the 'in-between' while I write the next paragraph you can re-join the group afterwards).NOTE: This is as depicted in the film: Susie Salmon was fourteen when she was murdered on December 6th 1973; she has never been kissed and will never grow up. Her body is never found, but her consciousness goes to a place known as 'the in-between', where she watches as her family try to come to terms with her loss and also try to discover what happened to her. Her father, Jack, becomes so obsessed with finding out what happened to his daughter that he ends up in hospital having stalked a man into a field only to be beaten up for his trouble. Her mother, Abigail, cannot face it all and has to take some time away from the family. Abigail's alcoholic mother, Grandma Lynn, comes to stay while she's away. Her sister, Lindsey, frustrated with the whole situation, focuses her attention on a neighbour, George Harvey, who she is convinced has something to do with Susie's disappearance. Through it all, Susie watches and tries to steer them in the right direction so that they can move on, and so can she. It's very difficult to summarise the plot without giving too much away, so I'll leave it there, I think I told you enough to know what the film is about.It's a beautiful film to look at, very clear images and some wonderful production. The time period the film was set was, for me, brought across perfectly, I'm only a few years younger than Susie would have been, and I remember the early 1970's quite well. I thought the performance from Saoirse Ronan as Susie Salmon was quite brilliant, she won several nominations and a few awards for the part. I also thought that Stanley Tucci as the creepy neighbour, George Harvey, was also excellent. Decent performances from Mark Wahlberg as Jack Salmon, Rachel Weisz as Abigail Salmon, Susan Sarandon was woefully underused (IMO) as Grandma Lynn and Rose McIver as Lindsey Salmon.There has been a lot of discussion about the depiction of 'the in-between'. Personally, I didn't have a problem with it; I guess whenever you adapt a book the picture in the reader's head will seldom match the vision of the director. Now, having read the book I find there are a lot of differences between the book and the film. Some of the changes make the film more coherent, but the book was already out there as a body of work a long time before the film. Don't get me wrong, it's a very good effort by Peter Jackson et al, but I think I'm always going to prefer the book.But going back to the film, I found it a little too long, but for the first hour it was totally engrossing. The visuals are stunning and there are a couple of great performances. I guess if you haven't read the book that I can recommend it to you, it's worth seeing. Now the tough one, if you have read, and loved, the book then maybe don't see this adaptation but if you're feeling brave... Oh, and in case you're interested, last time I scored it 7.1/10.My score: 6.4/10",The Lovely Bones
101,bellino-angelo2014,Decent despite its flaws,7,18 February 2021,"I have never read the book but I was always curious about this movie because it's directed by Peter Jackson (the same director of 2005's KING KONG and the LORD OF THE RINGS) and also because it treats the argument of life in the afterlife (after death). At the end of the watch I thought ''Kinda ok''.The film is about Susie Salmon (Saoirse Ronan), a 14-year old who on December 6, 1973 was murdered by her neighbour George Harvey (Stanley Tucci). She enters the In-Between, a dimension between the earthly world and Paradise where she can follow her family, her friends and also her murderer tho she can't interact with them. Jack Salmon (Mark Wahlberg) maintains her daughter's promise of developing her 24 photographic rolls one at a month and from one of the photos he discovers George Harvey and begins suspecting of him. After a while Susie accepts that the ''Lovely Bones'' of her terrestrial life (her family members) are now accepting of the fact that she is not with them anymore and, despite her loss, their life can go on with their course. In the ending George Harvey tries to pick up a girl but he is hit on his shoulder by an ice cone falling from a tree branch; he loses balance and falls down a ravine, dying of a slow and painful death. Susie's mom Abigail (Rachel Weisz) enters her deceased daughter's room and after their family finds again peace.What I liked of this movie are the sets and their CGI as Peter Jackson is a master in mixing them both without failing. I liked also the performances, especially by Mark Wahlberg and Saoirse Ronan but also from Susan Sarandon as Susie's alcoholic grandmother. Stanley Tucci played a very effective villain.What I didn't liked was that the plot at times seemed a bit confused up until the final twist and some of the imagery was quite weird and also that the indie soundtrack was very repetitive from time to time.Overall it's a quite weird movie that has to this day many mixed views. Some liked it, some loved it and some hated it. I guess I just belong in the first category.",The Lovely Bones
102,K3nzit,Good movie,7,3 January 2020,"Great performances by Stanley Tucci and Saoirse Ronan. Peter Jackson does a great job as-well, but uses a bit too many afterlife scenes. Almost as good as the similar movie 'What Dreams May Come' with Robin Williams.",The Lovely Bones
103,johnstonjames,"Awesome, Trippy, Scary Mind Blower",8,29 April 2010,"i didn't read the book, so i don't know how good this was as a adaptation of the novel, but as a film i thought it was really pretty good and really scary stuff.this movie was a return to Peter Jackson when he was good. before he became a commercial sell-out with mediocre stuff like 'King Kong' or 'Lord Of The Rings', but when he was genuinely good and made films like 'Heavenly Creatures', 'Dead Alive',and 'The Frighteners'.i would have rated this film higher than eight stars, but i always think nine stars means a best picture and ten means a great classic. i'm not sure this movie is either so eight will have to do. but it was a really entertaining and really scary flick. i mean just the subject matter alone will give you the creepy crawlies. a fourteen year old girl getting murdered by a pervert is all too real and close to today's headlines. the one scene where the murderer chases the victim's sister will make you shriek.even though special effects have come a long way since the days of his older films like 'Heavenly Creatures', i still prefer the intense impact those films could have. as good as this film was, and i really liked this spook flick, it's lighter than Jackson's early stuff, but a lot better than his recent films have been.",The Lovely Bones

105,JohnRayPeterson,Gut-wrenching drama served with a spoonful of honey,7,30 April 2011,"Having read the IMDb storyline, it was ominously indicative of subject matter many would not enjoy watching; I preferred passing on this movie or at least waiting for a better moment to view it. Considering all the nominations this film was noted for and a dream cast for such a sensitive topic, I could not postpone watching it any longer; Ronan, Weisz, Wahlberg and especially Tucci are all actors whose performances I try not to miss. I watched it recently; I had to ponder a little before putting my thoughts about it to paper, or in this case, the screen.The surreal moments, cinematic storytelling rarely if ever to my liking, were at least done with eye catching effects and definitely a plus for such a type of endeavour,surrealism. Consider the gamble the producers took with both the subject matter and the choice to use artsy narrative that are the surreal scenes. Well they may not have made good financially with that combo but they did make a movie I was able to watch without much difficulty in its entirety. I don't know if it's a Peter Jackson uniqueness, but he can find ways to tell a gruesome horrific and cruel passage of a story with delicate, politically acceptable and even calm dispassion. I had plenty of time to '360' my feelings about Susie's (the victim) parents coping, by the end of the movie; good acting, strong script and intuitive directing is what's needed to accomplish that. Stanley Tucci's character(murderous pedophile) did not hog the story as it could have so easily, leaving instead room to absorb through the slow introduction of his victims, the intensity of the crime spree and the climactic downfall of the hypocritical brute at the hands of Susie's loving sister.In this movie, the now obvious talent of Saoirse Ronan is showcased whether this was intended when the casting was done or not. I was not disappointed in the least with all the actors' performances but Ronan's did stand out. This is a good movie but not one you want to see for an entertaining one and a half hour; also not one you would be satisfied with if you're looking for a topically sensational presentation on the subject. You can watch this movie if you are a fan of at least a couple of the actors and if you are an avid movie lover. It's the kind critics will like but not the average audience.",The Lovely Bones
106,Likes_Ninjas90,"This is a flawed but interesting film, one that is certainly overlong and lacking in clarity, but not entirely without its merits",7,7 January 2010,"This adaptation of Alice Sebold's novel is set during the 1970s and is narrated by the voice of a young girl named Susie Salmon (Saoirse Ronan). Susie recalls the ordinary life she was living with her siblings and her parents Jack and Abigail (Mark Wahlberg and Rachel Weisz), up until she was murdered by their next door neighbour George Harvey (Stanley Tucci). Prior to her death Susie was meant to visit a boy named Ray who liked her. Grieving in her absence, Ray meets a strange girl who can still feel Susie's presence. Susie reveals that she is neither alive nor dead because she is stuck somewhere between Heaven and Earth. She cannot let go of her family and they cannot move on from her memory because of the ongoing investigation led by Detective Len Fenerman (Michael Imperioli) and Jack's obsession. The arrival of the kooky Grandma Lynn, a hard drinking old woman, does little to prevent the decline of the Salmon family.Director Peter Jackson is best known for the enormity of his sweeping epics The Lord of the Rings and King Kong. Prior to these big budget fantasy films though, Jackson was continually intrigued by the supernatural and the undead staying amongst the living. One of Jackson's first films was the low budget horror film Bad Taste. This immensely popular zombie gore fest was loved by many if only for its sheer awfulness but complete lack of pretension. Similarly, one of Jackson's less celebrated efforts was The Frighteners, in which Michael J. Fox played a conman who, following the death of his wife in a car accident, could communicate with ghosts. It was a very unusual mixture, blending schlock horror elements with comedy as well. It is in reflection of these earlier works that Jackson's attraction to Sebold's novel seems quite fitting. The Lovely Bones persist with similar supernatural elements and a crime story too. Having not read the novel, this is an engaging film by itself, but also one that suffers from a difficult fusion of crime, family drama and a more spiritually profound journey.One of the most interesting aspects of the film is the atmosphere and the setting that Jackson has visually defined. This is suburban American, complete with paved driveways and the murky grey skies that hint at the foreboding danger. That Susie's voice over tells us that it was a time when kids faces were not put on milk bottles when they went missing, suggests the naivety of America in this period, unconditioned and uneducated about the heinous crimes of child abuse. It is this same innocence and naivety of the society that is projected onto Susie, her dreamlike vision of her would-be school lover and her careless fatal actions of falling into her neighbour's web. Ronan really does have a sweetness about her that is required for such a young role. Her voice over, perhaps slightly over used, is best when describing the emotions of the killer she can still see. This is another young actress who will have a very significant career in years to come. The first half of the film dealing with her character's murder is certainly the best. This is due impart to a truly creepy performance by Stanley Tucci. He looks slightly seedy but any hint of normality is undone by the nervousness and mumblings of his voice and his stilted movements. The way he sits in his car just watching the neighbours or stares out his window, is both suggestive and entirely uncertain. It could hardly be called a subtle representation but it is certainly effective and his presence really elevates the tension of the suburban scenes, particularly in the kidnapping scene and the break-in of a house.For a number of its qualities the film does suffer from it's over length, its clouded message and rather uneven tone. The fantasy scenes between heaven and Earth are problematic because they allow the tone of the film to shift from a heavy crime investigation to something much more sentimental and surreal. There was always going to be an obvious distance between these two worlds but the way these fantasy moments are presented, including Susie dancing in what she envisions as a perfect world, are jarring. There is also a montage in the suburban areas, with Sarandon's character trying to clean up the house, which feels like it belongs more appropriately in a wacky Hollywood comedy. The afterlife scenes are beautiful because Jackson is a director who that specialises in visual effects and in capturing the grandeur of landscapes. It is a shame that the symbolism in these scenes, and their relationship to the rest of the film, is not always clear. Only towards the end does the films message about one having to move on and leaving fate to dictate justice emerge.Even in isolation to its source material, this is a flawed but interesting film, one that is certainly overlong and lacking in clarity, but not entirely without its merits. The film still benefits from some good performances as well as a number of moments of tension and also visual flair. It might even bring others that are unfamiliar to Sebold's work to read her novel and perhaps have a greater understanding of what the film was trying to say. Hopefully Jackson's next project, where he is set to be working on a series of Tintin films with Steven Spielberg, will be somewhat more consistent.",The Lovely Bones
107,Christian_Dimartino,Really not that bad.,7,15 June 2010,"Saoirse Ronan stars in Peter Jackson's visionary The Lovely bones, a disappointment to some extent but I still liked it. Nobody liked it. Yes, you expect more from director Peter Jackson, the genius behind King Kong, The Lord of the rings trilogy, Heavenly creatures, and The Frighteners. Though it doesn't compare to those films, I am still reccomending it.Oscar-nominee Ronan plays Susie Salmon, a teenage girl who is murdered by a creepy neighborhood fellow(played by Stanley Tucci in his Oscar-nominated role). Susie watches over her family while in heaven.Her father(played by Mark Whalberg) tries to figure out who killed her, while the killer is on the loose. Other things happen involving Susie's crush and other things. Some strange, and some, well just watch it.I liked the movie. It was interesting, the acting from Stanley Tucci and Susan Surrandon as Susie's grandmother was good, Mark Whalberg was good too. I don't know why, but I thought the film was flawed. The resolution, though right, could've been better. The film could've been a little creepier. Jackson is a great film maker. The film isn't quite great, but I still liked it. It has some great visuals to it. Jackson is a visionary himself. I wish the film were a little better, but it's not a bad movie.The Lovely Bones: B",The Lovely Bones
108,MattyGibbs,Brilliant and chilling fantasy drama,10,17 February 2015,The Lovely Bones covers the rather depressing issue of a child murder. A recently murdered schoolgirl tells the story from purgatory of her death and how it affected her family. This is an unusual story and one that is difficult to film but I think that Peter Jackson pulls it off in fine style. There is an air of dread as the film builds up to Susie's untimely death. The scene of her death is brilliantly handled but very disturbing. The images of purgatory are also brilliantly realised to my mind. It covers well the emotions felt by the family at losing their daughter in such a horrific way. There are outstanding performances from both Saoirse Ronan as Susie Salmon and from a chillingly creepy Stanley Tucci as the killer. Good support is given by Mark Wahlberg and Susan Sarandon. The only slight downside to me was the ending which I find a bit unsatisfactory but this doesn't take away from what has gone before. This is a superb fantasy drama which to my mind is underrated probably because of it's themes rather than it's quality. Highly recommended.,The Lovely Bones
109,joachimokeefe,'Contact' done as a lame police procedural,1,26 April 2011,"The cutting-edge (for the time) CGI completely overpowers this movie, because the plot is so feeble. You may manage to stay with it in order to see the murderer get his comeuppance, but not because you care about any of the characters. I actually laughed at the scenes with the mother running off to work in an orchard - she did about ten seconds' work, then sat around reading letters while the other fruitpickers slaved away.Mark Wahlberg does a pretty good job with a feeble script, but he's miscast as a ship-in- bottle building accountant. Susan Sarandon as the lush mother-in-law is (over)acting in a different movie, Saiorse Ryan does a very competent turn as a green-screen cypher in dreamland, but the whole thing simply doesn't hang together.Susie's story kept reminding me of Jodie Foster in 'Contact' - but there, the CGI other-world was very much the whole point. Here, the CGI's a digression from the story, such as it is. A family disintegrates after the sex murder of the favourite daughter? Smothered by CGI. A father tracks the murderer of his daughter with help from the afterlife? Smothered by CGI. Take away the CGI and you have an unfocused, predictable melodrama with a deus-ex-machina ending poorly disguised as supernatural intervention.I did think Michael Imperioli as the detective was a good turn at first, but as with the rest of the script, nothing is done with the character and you may as well be watching 'Murder, She Wrote'. Any episode of 'Columbo', or even 'Quincy' has more story than 'Lovely Bones', which completely misses the mark.",The Lovely Bones
110,Eumenides_0,Imperfect Thriller With Excellent Tense Moments,6,1 April 2010,"Peter Jackson's latest movie follows the murdered 14-year-old Susie Salmon to the afterlife as she narrates what happens on Earth after she's dead. This movie had the potential to be a emotionally powerful story, but bad writing, pacing and editing damage it. What we're left with is an uneven, sometimes corny movie that has some amazing scenes that are left undeveloped for their maximum effect.The premise is quite fascinating. A young girl is murdered by her serial killer neighbor. Her dad, not satisfied with the police work, begins his own investigation, becoming so obsessed that he drives his wife away. The dead girl's sister also becomes involved in the investigation when she starts suspecting the neighbor.This should have led to a brilliant, exciting, tense thriller.But too much of the movie is spent in an uninteresting (if visually pretty) afterlife as Susie narrates in a most uninteresting way what is going on. I'm not one of those people who thinks voice over is a no-no in cinema. But for me there's good voice over - Adaptation, Apocalypse Now, Platoon - and then there's saccharine, sentimental pap. Saoirse Ronan follows her Oscar-nominated performance in Atonement with one that doesn't give her much to do other than be pretty and angelic.Not enough time is spent with the disintegration of the family. Mark Wahlberg and Rachel Weisz do the best they can as Susie's grieving parents, but the movie hardly focuses on them.If I had to single out the best actor in the movie, that'd be Stanley Tucci. His performance as Mr. George Harvey, a seemingly normal and respectable neighbor who's in fact a sadistic child murderer, is perfect. He complete transformed himself for this role, and although his make-up is good, what's really amazing is his voice and little ticks that he adopts. This is one of those rare intelligent, truly chilling villains. And there's nothing glamorous about him, like in many Hollywood villains. Christoph Waltz may have dominated 2009 in his performance as Colonel Hans Landa, but if The Lovely Bones hadn't been such a box office failure, I'm sure we'd be hearing a lot more about Tucci's performance here.There are excellent tense sequences in the movie - when Mr. Harvey convinces Susie to visit his underground room; when Susie's sister breaks into Mr. Harvey's house; when Susie's dad starts suspecting he's the killer. But these scenes are short and sparse, and are always ruined by scenes that defy logic.In the end The Lovely Bones stands as an imperfect movie that had a lot of potential to be a modern masterpiece thriller. It's one of those movies that one wants to love more and is disappointed that it never lives up to the expectations.",The Lovely Bones
111,asda-man,Lovely,8,25 July 2011,"I don't particularly understand why ""The Lovely Bones"" gets so much hate from everyone. How could anyone possibly give it a 1/10 considering the outstanding visuals! Peter Jackson has created a faithful adaptation (that's a complete guess, I haven't read the book!) This is why books are converted to the big-screen so we can enhance the visuals in our head! Probably the best thing was the incredible visuals. This is why blu-ray was invented! Think Tim's ""Alice in Wonderland"" only more frittle, they're full of life and brightness and really lift up the films spirit (haha see what I did there?) Even if you're not keen on the fantasy-driven story, then surely you can at least admire the outlandish CGI effects? Peter Jackson's directing also has to be commended. He directs it beautifully with Stanley Tucci always being filmed very candid and raw, whilst Susie Salmon (real name) is filmed delicately allowing us to see all the beauty that surrounds her.Stanley Tucci can quite scarily switch from a happy-go-lucky character eg. ""Devil Wears Prada"" and ""Burlesque"", to creepy psychopath. A bit like Robin Williams in ""One Hour Photo"". Stanley's performance has to be commended, he is so creepy and menacing. The part where Susie encounters Stanley for the first time is really intense.Peter Jackson also masters cranking up the suspense and the tension. It's sometimes thrilling and heart-stopping, especially when Stanley Tucci's around! Mark Whalberg (however you feckin' spell it!) Over acted a bit, which is usually the case. He went a little overboard as the manic father. But, the girl who played Susie Salmon (such an amusing name) was really fantastic for a girl of he age, without sounding patronising.So why the heck does this get so much slamming? I thought it was a beautiful, moving and thrilling piece of cinema that is unforgettable for all the right reasons. It's a master-class in directing and how to act creepy! Well done Peter!",The Lovely Bones
112,cinematic_aficionado,"A moving film with good ambiance, but nothing more",6,23 February 2010,"The spectacle that one has come to expect from Peter Jackson is present in ""The Lovely Bones"" and although it is not as grand as in the Lord of the Rings, still this film is a visually captivating experience. We follow the drama of a girl, a family, a life lost so unexpectedly and senselessly. The loss of life aside, which is the greatest loss, we also end up feeling sorry of how the victim was deprived of her first kiss. Despite the fact that the audience becomes aware that Suzie will die, the viewers' suffering is not in any way reduced because of such knowledge. The dead girl remains a participant in the goings-on of this tragic stricken family as they try to cope with the unbearable loss, a loss that is even more agonizing by the absence of a body. Despite this sense of loss, the observance of the victim's adjustment in the afterlife provides some relief. The questions this film ultimately brings to surface are about justice, vengeance, coping and ultimately the concept of paying the price and redemption. Eventually what will impact this film's final verdict depends on one's beliefs on afterlife.",The Lovely Bones
113,bregund,Maybe it needed a woman director?,4,3 February 2016,"Jackson seems out of his depth here, and incapable of translating the nuances of the book. Having read the book, the most egregious sin is that he ignored the family's story arc, which went on for many years after Susie's death; Jackson instead points his long, plodding, stultifying emphasis on events not long after her disappearance. The problem with heaven is that it's boring, nothing bad ever happens there, and Jackson spends half the film in it. Poetic license? Yes, he does go there, including a sappy reunion of Harvey's victims at the end, and an unsatisfying interpretation of his clever death. Can I say one more time how much narration ruins a film...let the story tell the film, don't let a voice-over explain the story. The only bright spot is Stanley Tucci's chilling, manipulative portrayal as Harvey, you feel like you want to shower after watching him. It's impossible to connect with any of the other characters, either because of their wooden acting or because Jackson doesn't bother nurturing any of them, he just points the camera at them and says roll. All in all, a poor effort at best, and a mere shadow of the book. On that note, this film is a cautionary example about assuming that everyone who will see the film has read the book.",The Lovely Bones

Some of the shots are the type that stick into your mind - like the fiery pit the killer digs into the cornfield. I really like the way it changes from that moment into the spirit world. The first time I watched the movie I didn't really like all the after life stuff because all I wanted was a straight up twisted thriller. But, after a few viewings, and a few years, I've come to appreciate that side of the story. The sink pit is a great set piece and one of the most sad moments, the thought of no one knowing what happened doesn't sit well with me, but I wouldn't change that at all.",The Lovely Bones
116,ClaytonDavis,"Lovely in Performances, Bones in Narrative",6,28 November 2009,"Alice Sebold wrote the beautiful book, ""The Lovely Bones"" back in 2002. It was a critical sensation among readers all over the world. A beautiful tale of loss, redemption, love, and revenge all interconnected and being told through the eyes of a fourteen-year old girl, Susie Salmon, who is murdered in 1973 by one of her neighbors. When announced that it would become a film, many fans worried about the translation of the literary work and how it could be interpreted by the great Peter Jackson. So, did Jackson get it right?It's a near miss from the Oscar-winning director of The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King. The Lovely Bones is an over- thought and at times visually exhausting picture. When it's great, it's really great, especially the first half-hour. The story begins enormously emotional and you could likely be in tears from moment one. Jackson and fellow writers Fran Walsh and Phillippa Boyens drove too far from the original story, leaving out key components that made the novel so extraordinary. The character development is a bit lazy and under thought in place of an over zealous visual spectacle, which is to say the least, quite impressive. Is The Lovely Bones a bad film? Just as a film, definitely not. It's a valiant effort and has some beautiful things that tie it together nicely. As an adaptation stand point, it's not one of the strongest works of the year. Where Jackson faltered in some parts, he made up for in others.The big star studded cast is some of the best actors working today. Rachel Weisz, Oscar Winner for The Constant Gardener, is satisfactory in one of the most underdeveloped characters of the entire story. Playing ""Abigail,"" Susie's mother, Weisz takes on one of AMPAS' favorite characters, the suffering mother/wife. Weisz does a great job at conveying her loss and pain for her daughter and the battle for her unemotionally available husband. Where Weisz goes wrong however, is illustrating the inner conflict in her player. Many people and critics may interpret it as a throw-away role, in which ""Abigail"" could have provided many opportunities for her.Susan Sarandon plays ""Grandma Lynn,"" a heavy drinker with a near infantile attitude towards life and her family. ""Lynn"" doesn't provide anything more or less to the story other then momentary comic relief for the very heavy subject matter. Sarandon gives her all but nothing superior to some of her other co-stars. Michael Imperioli is brief and again, unused and misused. Mark Wahlberg, replacing Ryan Gosling early in the film's production, is better than one would have thought. Wahlberg is a gritty, tough man in real life, and in his acting career, his best works have been where he's allowed to essentially play himself. Here however, Wahlberg exhibits sensitivity, paternal instinct, and a loving aura; these things have not been seen by him before. Also, not receiving billing on the marketing materials, Rose McIver (who plays Lindsey, Susie's sister), Reece Ritchie (Ray, Susie's love interest), and Carolyn Dando (Ruth, a teenager with who is touched by Susie's spirit) are all suitable and adequate. The film belongs to Saoirse Ronan and Stanley Tucci in two of the very best performances of the year. Ronan who plays the sweet ""Susie,"" is on her way to superstardom, mark my words. She easily could be our next Kate Winslet, a remarkable young talent that will take the film world by storm. She efficiently and resourcefully portrays a heartbreaking and emotive young girl with nearly no effort. Ronan can get nearly lost in all the heavenly images displayed, but will rise out of it with tears and quality. Stanley Tucci, who plays ""George Harvey,"" the killer of the young fourteen-year old, gives one of the most shockingly and horrifying performances of the year or perhaps, the last ten years. As the mentally unstable and child pedophile, Tucci shows assurance and seems almost comfortable in the skin of his dark-natured player. Alarming as it is, Tucci demands attention and engages his audience with fear and panic. It's one of his most brilliant turns seen yet. He could easily be the Oscar winner in March 2010. These are two of the best performances worthy of critical and Oscar consideration this year. Take note.Artistically the film sits quite well. Cinematography by Andrew Lesnie, Sound by Tod A. Maitland, and a beautiful score by Brian Eno are the strongest mechanical portions of the film. Direction by Peter Jackson is stamped, printed, and in the mail as he creates a world that is both beautiful and revolting. The narrative is unfortunately lost and rushed in its two hour and fifteen minute run time. It's an epic story that needs time to settle into the viewers. Bothersome is that we've come to expect long films from Jackson in his career. Biting the bullet and paying that extra attention to narrative detail, Jackson could have made a world of a difference and left a more gratifying and nourishing feeling for the viewer.The Lovely Bones is still, a solid effort and shouldn't be automatically dismissed. I really wanted to like it. My expectations were through the roof (as fans of The Awards Circuit can attest) and it under whelmed. It's not necessarily a masterpiece but at least worth a consideration. Some, who may have not read the book, could agree with the film and no comparisons can be made. Whatever its worth, the theme is still alive and can still leave one sustained.***/****",The Lovely Bones
117,richieandsam,A very good film that deserves more praise.,7,9 April 2014,"THE LOVELY BONESI had never heard of this film before. I saw it advertised on the TV and saw that it was directed by Peter Jackson and starred Mark Wahlberg﻿ so thought I had to see this.The story is told throughout the film by a little girl who has been murdered. She talks you through the murder and the aftermath including the hunt for her killer and the anguish that her family are going through.I really like the idea of this. Right at the beginning of the film you find out that she was murdered. There was no suspense about it,no long drawn out story. But yet the story is still being told by her. Is she in heaven? Is she actually dead? It is a great opener to a movie.Even though you know she has been murdered, when you see the murder about to happen, there is still a very good bit of suspense. I felt really on edge when he was talking to her. Even though I knew what was about to happen I wanted her to run, I wanted her to just get away from him. It was really well put together and shot.The acting is brilliant throughout by everyone. The star of the film for me has to be Stanley Tucci. The guy is so creepy and horrible in the film that I actually hated him throughout. He did a fantastic job. But there were excellent performances from all the other cast too. Saoirse Ronan was brilliant. I thought this was a great performance that deserved an Oscar nod. She is a very talented actress and I hope she has a long career ahead of her. Other great cast members were Mark Wahlberg, Rachel Weisz, Susan Sarandon, Michael Imperioli and Rose McIver.There were times when I thought the story slowed down a little too much. I wasn't bored, but I was thinking that I wanted it to pick up a bit.The ending was brilliant. I would love to go into more detail, but I never post spoilers so can't say anything... but if you have seen this then you know what I mean. It is a great way to end the film... a lot of other writers would have written it differently, but I am glad that it ended this way.In closing I would say this film is a really good movie that I could watch again. It doesn't feel like a Peter Jackson epic, but it is very well done.I will give this film 7 out of 10.""There was one thing my murderer didn't understand; he didn't understand how much a father could love his child.For more reviews, please like my Facebook page:https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl",The Lovely Bones
118,Shattered_Wake,A beautiful and stirring emotional roller coaster,8,5 January 2010,"Peter Jackson has proved himself to be a director that truly knows how to make a hugely beautiful film, no matter what he's doing. Even his crazy splatter horrors from the early 1990s had something special going for them that most similar filmmakers never could achieve. After spending so many years in the adventure epics of Lord of the Rings and King Kong, however, it was surprising to see that Jackson would have chosen his next picture to be what I imagined would be a ""small movie."" After viewing the film, though, his reason for choosing it became apparent.Based on the novel by Alice Sebold, the story tells of Susie Salmon (Saoirse Ronan) who is viciously murdered by a neighbourhood man and, from her trip to heaven, looks down on the world in an attempt to help her father (Mark Wahlberg) find her own murderer. This heartbreaking tale was adapted to the screen by Peter Jackson himself along with Fran Walsh & Philippa Boyens (both of whom worked with Jackson on his previous projects) and delivers a very good script full of tear-jerking drama and well rounded characters. One of the issues of the script is a strange case of irregular pacing, moving from the terrifying horror to depressing melodrama without much of a transition. The characters are brought to life with some great performances by the young Saoirse Ronan in the lead role, Mark Wahlberg as the desperate father, Rachel Weisz as Susie's distraught mother, and Susan Sarandon as the funny grandmother. The best performance was delivered by the oft-ignored Stanley Tucci as Mr. Harvey. With some great makeup effects and his chillingly creepy demeanor, Tucci's Harvey was a disturbing and realistic monster.One complaint many people seem to have about the film is the overuse of CGI and greenscreen. The counter-argument to this is, ""Well, how else do you expect to properly convey the afterworld?"" You can't very well film the passage to heaven on Earth, can you? Naysayers be damned, however, as the landscapes Jackson designs are fantastically beautiful.Overall, if you're looking for a 'Stir of Echoes'-type thriller about a ghost helping to find her murderer, this is not the film to see. But if you're looking for a heartbreaking character drama about a family's struggle to cope, give this one a shot.Final Verdict: 8/10.-AP3-",The Lovely Bones
119,PeachHamBeach,Another unique vision from Peter Jackson,9,24 April 2010,"I knew there was something familiar about this eerie yet uplifting movie! Not since HEAVENLY CREATURES have I seen anything quite this unique about the life of a young teenage girl (actually the death).The thing I loved most was the fact that the entire story is from Susie's perspective, not her grieving parents. Susie is not reduced to a ""victim"". You are forced to care about her because long before she meets her undeserved fate, you watch her living her life, her innocence, her budding romance with a handsome boy at school, her photography, her relationships with her family. And then she is completely robbed of her life.But we are not to pity her. Once she arrives in a new world beyond the life we're familiar with, she and a new friend named Holly, though they don't understand why their mortal lives ended, are now existing in peace and tranquility, even having great times that teen girls should be allowed to have. I LOVED how they were having fun with clothes and makeup and magazines.Meanwhile, the one to pity AND to revile is the pathetic loser murderer, bound in chains by his compulsion to kill children, never feeling anything but emptiness, because his soul is gone. He may think he's some powerful being, taking the lives that he does, but he is simply a NOTHING. And he does at least get some form of punishment for his evil deeds.Susie is in a better place, but as she watches her family slowly falling apart because of her her unsolved disappearance, she agonizes for them, not for herself, and begins to make connections with them in an effort to help them, too, find peace.It's a very unique story, like nothing you've ever experienced. You won't get the standard resolutions that you want, but when the film ends, you will be satisfied. THE LOVELY BONES is a haunting, mesmerizing, and LOVELY film.",The Lovely Bones
120,estreet-eva,Not as bad as people say but not that great either,6,5 December 2011,"Peter Jackson makes a beautiful mess of the iconic book club selection. In this adaptation, Jackson brings his visual bravado to bear on the hard-to-watch tale of underage sexual predation and serial murder. Jackson is at his best rendering the afterlife experienced by the murdered main character in dynamic and flowing images which mirror the girl?s emotions as she watches events post her rape and slaughter. Although meditative and gorgeous these sequences do play too long at times and occasionally take on the look of a Big Pharma TV commercial for the latest dubious psychological condition. When not in heaven or ?the in-between? however, this lyrical flow becomes a whole lot more choppy and one might even venture?sloppy. The killer, played with quiet creepiness, by Stanley Tucci is somehow able to dig an entire room under a cornfield by himself unnoticed and later loads a monstrous metal safe into a truck also unaided. The grandmother, played as a sloppy alcoholic and chain-smoker by Susan Sarandon, is introduced to the Salmon household in a goofy music video montage jarringly different in tone and look to the entire remainder of the film. At one point the grieving mother leaves home without warning to show up incongruently picking apples with migrant workers at an orchard and then later returns with as little explanation. In short the plot part of the film is ultimately unsatisfying (without giving anything away) and prompts the audience to instead look at the holes rather than anticipating what will happen next. What does work is Saoirse Ronan?s works as the murdered Susie Salmon. As cliché as it sound she is one of the very few actors who was simply born to be on the big screen. Neither Jackson nor the audience is able to look away during her abundant screen time. I have no idea how to say her first name but I guarantee it is one the world will know soon enough. In summary, it needed a stronger editor to cleave out 20-30 minutes of run time and to bridge the disjointed plot but worth it to watch Saoirse Ronan at work.",The Lovely Bones
121,moviemanMA,"Not Jackson's best, but WOW look at Stanley Tucci",6,8 January 2010,"Jackson takes on the bestselling novel The Lovely Bones, a story told through the eyes of a girl who has just been murdered. Saoirse Ronan (Atonement) plays Susie Salmon, the girl who has just been murdered. She is lured to her death by her neighbor George Harvey (Stanley Tucci). After she goes missing, her father (Mark Wahlberg) begins the search for his missing girl, while his wife (Rachel Weisz) tries to deal with the loss on her own terms. The family is falling apart, all the while Susie watches from her own world, the world of the dead.This is the part of the movie that I don't like. In an earlier film by Jackson called Heavenly Creatures, we enter a similar occupied by two girls, only this world is purely imagination. It's a vibrant, colorful, and magical world filled with flowers, castles, and whatever their hearts desire. He employs almost the same exact format for The Lovely Bones, using bright colors, sprawling landscapes, and objects that coincide with what goes on in the real world, like Susie's father's model ships. What I don't like about this aspect of the film is how fake it looks. It's very cheesy and looks almost rushed. In Heavenly Creatures, which came out in 1994, Jackson used both artificial and real life creations to create his world. Here it is just sensory overload.Not all is lost. Jackson is a great director. I like his camera movements and ability to build up suspense. I think the way he set up the movie was fine, just poor execution in the visuals. I like the way he goes back and forth between the world of the dead and the world of the living. As ridiculous as Susie's world is, I do like the interactions and jumping around from place to place. It's very entertaining and keeps the story constantly moving.I hoped that attracting the big names to the film would be a bonus. I thought three of the big names, Wahlberg, Weisz, and Susan Sarandon as the grandmother. I expected more from these Oscar winning and nominated actors. I have a great deal of respect for them, they just didn't pull through for me. I felt like I had seen there characters before. There was nothing new. Sarandon's accent in particular I felt like I had heard a hundred times like in Bull Durham. Wahlberg hasn't done it for me since The Departed and Weisz has needs to recapture her magic from The Constant Gardner. I wasn't upset by their performances, but I know they can do better.The one thing to take away from this film is Stanley Tucci's performance. Tucci is one of those actors who has done a lot of work but never really gets a big role. Here he plays a quiet, creepy, very neighborly man who on the outside is a nice, wholesome, and gentle man. Once we find out who he really is, all of those things that make him appear nice and normal turn him into a monster. Behind his gold rimmed glasses are cold, blue eyes that look right through you. I don't think his looks and acting alone make him stand out, but the other actors around him don't play up their characters as much. Tucci is handed a great role and he plays it perfectly. He steals the show.As much as I didn't like the ending of the film, it is one of the better parts of the film. It doesn't follow convention. We are given a unique story told from a unique perspective. Although it wasn't executed quite the way I would have liked it, I thought the way they told the story from Susie's point of view was pretty good. If only they would have changed the look of her world.I expected a lot more from this movie. I wanted better storytelling and more acting from such a star studded cast. I was very pleased with what Tucci gives us but other than that, the film is somewhat average and doesn't live up to the hype it has received. I hope Jackson doesn't attempt something quite like this, although he can make a good fantasy film. Hopefully he just swung and missed at this one, though it should have been a home run. I hope Tucci's performance doesn't get overlooked.",The Lovely Bones
122,LloydBayer,"Vivid and abstract, but a good story nonetheless",6,3 July 2011,"Adapting a film from a source material that is anything but intended for cinema is always a tricky thing to do. Judging by the largely negative criticism this film received, Alice Sebold's novel by the same name is apparently gutted by director Peter Jackson. Apparently, because that is exactly what some mainstream critics seem to think. On the other hand, I have not read Sebold's novel. As such, I think it's safe to assume that my experience may have been better than those who did read her book. Even so, I'm sure my experience was a lot better than those who read it and watched the film with the sole intention of harshly comparing one to the other. Even J. K. Rowling has her fair share of 'haters' when you talk about what Harry Potter does on screen, as compared to what he does in one of her books. So the next time you decide to lash out at a film maker for not living up to your novel (pun unintended) experience, think for a minute what it would be like to watch a movie, adapted word for word from the novel it's sourced. Even if you read one page at the rate of one minute, how would a 300 or 400 page novel translate into a 300 or 400 minute movie? Even if that were possible, what good would it be if the source material was not altered for the screen? And why shouldn't it be, given that both mediums are limited in creativity. So coming back to the subject on hand, and since I did not read the novel, I can say without a pause, that the movie experience was decent enough to have had me glued to the screen from beginning to end. In her narrative, Saoirse Ronan (pronounced Ser-Sher) explains her character's tragic end and what happens after. As Susie Salmon, Ronan portrays a time in America when ""do not talk to strangers"" was an unheard-of caution; a time when children could roam freely and not have to live in fear of preying eyes. Sadly enough, talking to a stranger was the last thing Susie Salmon did, before being murdered, dismembered and never to be found again. But this is where her story begins, first discovering her own death, then being stranded between her overwhelming feeling of vengeance towards her murderer and watching her family suffer and tear apart during their untimely loss. It is at this juncture, or the ""in-between"", as she calls it, where Susie shockingly learns that she is not the first, but the most recent victim in a series of brutal murders. Questionable by some critics, is Jackson's use of strong visual effects in portraying Susie's transition into the ""in-between"". After ""King Kong"" and ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy, we see why Jackson is well endowed in the CGI department. That said, even having Steven Spielberg sign on as executive producer could not have influenced Jackson into telling Sebold's story in any other way but his. Visuals are crisp, abstract, and fluent while his color palette is deep yet intense with contrast, resulting in images that will push your Bluray player and HD display to the max. Is it needed in a murder mystery? Not really, because the plot is not much of a mystery; it is an innocent 14 year old girl's narration of the after-life. Again, this is where cinema CGI has the edge over raw imagination, especially when reading a book. As far as mystery is concerned, there is none. After school one day, Susie doesn't reach home because she has been lured into an underground den, specifically engineered to entice under aged girls. Her last moments are spent with her captor, a seemingly average Joe. Playing this monster is the versatile Stanley Tucci in what has to be one of his best roles thus far, deservingly earning his first Academy Award Nomination in a supporting role. Although his offering is top notch, you can't help but notice the utter darkness oozing out of his character. If the eyes are windows to the soul, then Tucci does an exceptional job as George Harvey, complete with that unmistakable flicker of evil in his eyes. Other supporting roles come from Mark Wahlberg and Rachel Weisz as Susie's parents and Susan Sarandon as her grandmother. As always, Whalberg's rage-filled scenes are intense, but very rarely are his characters helpless. For the first time here, we get to see a combination of both. Sarandon's Grandma Lynn is questionable as this character does not add to the plot, nor can her inclusion be considered a sub-plot. But if there is ever a light moment throughout the film, it does come from Grandma Lynn. Another key character is played by Rose McIver as Susie's sister and in doing so, offers some of the film's intended suspense. This film succeeds as a drama. As a thriller, it could have been better. Comparing internet reviews between the book and the film will tell you that Jackson has chosen to leave the gory details out to get a wider audience. Although there are no actual scenes of rape, murder and mutilation, the act is heavily suggested during parts of the film and this is why it has a PG-13 rating instead of an R.",The Lovely Bones
123,dvc5159,The most underrated film of 2009. (Coming from a non-book reader.),6,19 March 2010,"""It was like watching a bad train wreck"". ""An $80 Million Lifetime Movie"". ""A grand, sloppy folly for Peter Jackson"".Really? Because I've seen worse that same year.The negative reception given to this film is somewhat cruel compared to other movies. You're complaining about the story being sappy? Then what do you call those melodramatic films of the '50s and '60s?I think I'm gonna get bashed for this, but I have not read Alice Sebold's novel prior to seeing this movie. Reading is not really my thing, I like to see it visually. Everyone has their own interests and opinions and is entitled to them. Anyway, taken entirely on its own this movie is an excellent fantasy thriller with compelling performances by Ronan, Wahlberg and Weisz, and an exceptionally, superbly creepy and disturbing performance by Tucci.Yes there are mistakes, but nothing is perfect. I think most of the negative reception is given by die-hard fans of the novel, disappointed by Peter Jackson's handling of it, and accusing him of ruining the novel's original point. Well I have no right to say anything about that given I didn't read the book. However Jackson directs with flair, the CGI sequences are outstanding and breathtaking. That doesn't mean he can't do live-action sequences either. The dramatic and suspense scenes are full of emotion and taut. Add beautiful cinematography and a perfect ambient score by Brian Eno and you got yourself an extraordinary mix of talent and skills.While other reviewers tend to complain that Jackson's CGI bogged down the performances, I beg to differ; his direction brings out the best in the actors. You care and feel a LOT for these characters. Especially Saoirse Ronan. She is absolutely brilliant as the lead role Susie Salmon. I could see her having a career like Natalie Portman. Mark Wahlberg gives his all as the devastated father, as per Rachel Weisz as the mother who cannot cope with her daughter's death. Susan Sarandon is good but I felt her role is played mostly for laughs instead of comfort.However it is Stanley Tucci that got the biggest impression out of me. He is a downright cruel and inhumane being. Pure evil. And his acting is brilliant, just brilliant. His villainous role doesn't just exist in the movies; knowing that people like George exist in the real world makes it even more disturbing. And Tucci pulls it off. He deserved his Oscar nomination and I hope for bigger things from him to come. Bravo.One more thing. Although it is rated PG-13 it has LOTS of mature themes and some shocking things in it that may not be for the faint of heart or emotionally sensitive. This is a movie that should be taken by its own merit, and not as an adaptation, for most of the case it would surely be inferior to the original. Films and novels are two different art visuals; please treat and judge them differently instead of comparing them. I highly recommend this excellent, highly underrated emotional roller-coaster of a film. It's an extremely intense, disturbing and ultimately gut-wrenching experience.Overall rating: 9/10",The Lovely Bones
124,fciocca,I am in a limbo!,7,9 September 2019,"After I watched this movie I really did not know how to feel about it, and it took me a few days before writing this review.Let's start with the positive things: the movie is interesting and very different from the average Hollywood movies. When I saw the Peter Jackson name, I was so excited, and I immediately thought: ""WOW, this guy is really versatile"". The movie start in Pennsylvenia and at the beginning you have a reassuring sensation, you think that everything is going to be just fine, but then suddently, everything goes wrong. After Susie is killed by Mr. Harvey she is trapped in this kind of limbo between life and death, which is very well rappresented. The CGI is... okay, considering the type of movie, and it rappresent really good this mystical world. Scenes where Susie communicates with the world of the living are very touchy and emotional. Many deep feelings are involved, it makes you think, how people can process a mourning for a loss that was not natural and it makes you understand how many different and contrasting feelings are present in those moments: sadness, but also anger, the faith that the lost person is in a better place, but also the lost of hope, because that person will be not anymore with you. It is really complicated and this is why is not a movie that you watch just to relax, because it makes you think and I actually scratch my head over and over around this concept, for a few daysThe cast is simply amazing and I was glad to see Rose McIver (iZombie), Stanley Tucci, which was very well fitted in the villain character and of course Mark Wahlberg, which is more known for comedy movies roles such in Teddy, but he was good even in this dramatic part.What I did not like about the movie? It is too long. I understand that these kind of movies need time to develop, because as I told before it has a big spectrum of emotions that need to be analyzed, but some scenes are just dragged and completely useless, also because the ending was rushed as hell, while the middle part was so slow. Peter Jackson could not find a proper balance and sometimes I was just there asking to myself if something was actually going to happen. Also final scenes were a little bit of a disappointment. There is a ""happy ending"", but not the kind that you expect. This can be actually good for someone,because it is different. I don't say that I did not liked it, it was just different from what I was having in my mind.Considering everything, I think that seven stars out of ten is the proper vote for this movie. I really appreciate that Peter Jackson took a big risk, by directing something completely different than he usually does, and this need to be noticed.",The Lovely Bones
125,gary-444,An Unlovely Mess,4,19 March 2011,"There are occasions when you watch a film, understand its merit, but simply reflect that it doesn't work for you. This is one such film. The book by Alice Sebold is much acclaimed, Director Peter Jackson is hugely experienced and vastly accomplished, as is executive producer Steven Spielberg, so what is it that doesn't work? The premise, of a murdered girl, Susie Salmon, played by Saorise Ronan, leading her parents, Jack and Abigail, to her killer from a spiritual nether world is an intriguing one. The cgi and staging of the girls scenes in spiritual limbo are fine, it's the ones on terra firma that disappoint.The planning and execution of the murder are understated which weaken the drama, there is no sense of horror about what has happened. Parents Mark Wahlberg and Rachel Weisz convincingly portray grief stricken parents, but this in turn is undermined by an almost comic turn by Susan Sarandon as a grandmother Lyn.Attention soon focuses on the real killer as Susie Salmon leads her family towards the clues, but for little obvious terrestrial reason. This is no Revenger's Tragedy ,and by the end, I found myself simply willing the end, which when it did come, was pretty unsatisfactory. Prior to this, Susie's father is beaten up by a teenage lad who has his romantic assignation with his girlfriend disturbed as Jack charges through the high crops in a field in a grief stricken frenzy reprising the actual voyeurism of the real killer. But so annoying has his role become that instead of sympathising with him for his injuries , the viewer is tempted to think he deserved it for being so irritating.There is a gripping opening to the final act when Susie's sister breaks into the killers house and steals a notebook containing vital evidence causing the perpetrator to flee. But the climax wholly ignores the police, and presumable family ,chase to catch up with him, to cut to a very strange, anti-climactic final scene.Shorn of visceral action, and with much of the film set in Susies' dream world, the reality sequences are simply not enough to carry the story over the line of credibility. Brian Eno's score is excellent, but its surreal ambiance only further distances the viewer from emotionally connecting with the story. Ronan's performance of Susie is anaemic, and bad guy George Harvey, played by Stanley Tucci, simply isn't sinister enough to really generate much viewer ill will. Investigating officer Fenerman played by Michael Imperioli has a cruelly underwritten scene and the end result is a film that goes nowhere in particular. Massively over-hyped watch on no-pay TV or borrow someone's DVD only.",The Lovely Bones
126,Jackpollins,"If it weren't for Stanley Tucci, I would have had to run to the grocery store to throw tomatoes at the screen",2,5 February 2010,"Of all the hollow, lifeless films I have seen (and as a huge film buff, I've seen a lot), nothing has felt so irritatingly hollow and lifeless as The Lovely Bones. I am in the minority of the people who have not actually read the book. People rave about how great the book is, but after seeing the film, I'm having my doubts about that. The film has so much wrong with it, I'll have to skip the plot (I'm sure everyone's aware of the plot since basically everyone's read the book) and go straight to its flaws. But first, I will say the one good thing about it. The one good thing comes in the form of an actor who's never failed to amaze me in his whole long acting career. If you have not figured that actor out yet, it is Stanley Tucci. He is effectively creepy as neighbor and villain Mr. Harvey. The only good thing is not only his acting, but there's at least the only means of interest to me was wanting to see his character get caught as his character is a terrible person. Now onto the bad, first, Susan Sarandon plays the main (and dead) character's grandmother and hams it up so, so, so, so much. Onto my next flaw, the main character is dead, and is in a land in between Heaven and Earth. This land looks like something some 2-year old would draw with a crayola crayon. Third, it is super boring, plain and simple. Fourth, there is only an ounce of suspense. Fifth, no character, besides Tucci's, has any humanity in them or nothing interesting about them. Sixth, I do not care about any of the characters in this film. Seventh, it feels like something I would watch at three in the morning. By that I mean, it feels like something I would watch late at night because it would help me fall asleep. Eigth, and last, the ending, no matter how good the film is (and it's not even close to good) will ruin the movie. You are totally cheated at the end as it's something they could have done within the first three minutes of the film. In a couple years, this will be the best movie on Lifetime at three in the morning, but for now, it's just a terrible movie.",The Lovely Bones

Nevertheless, this is a very unique and satisfying film. Though some of the acting and directions are not the greatest, Saoirse Ronan and several others give good performances here. THE LOVELY BONES is one of those films that is at once heartwarming and heartbreaking.THE LOVELY BONES is an interesting mix of fantasy, teen drama, and horror with Disneyesque--and I mean that in a good way--special effects and props. The afterlife scenes are absolutely breathtaking, and, although the plot-line wavers in places and has its share of holes, it's never dull, keeps your attention, and doesn't come out anywhere near as predictably as you might think. Set in the 1970s, THE LOVELY BONES captures that period most convincingly. While it sometimes has the feel of an After-School Special, there is one pretty gruesome (for a PG-13) post-murder dream sequence, which contributes still more to its interesting blend of qualities.Never seen anything like it, and highly recommend!",The Lovely Bones

Reports of Ryan Gosling showing up to set with a full beard and 60 pounds gained for the role, much to the dismay of Jackson led him to be quickly replaced by Mark Wahlberg - who looks like he wondered onto a set last minute. While Gosling being canned saved him the embarrassment of being in this stinker, there's no actor here that shows any commitment to the role. Susan Sarandon is written, directed and played in the broadest, hammiest and most cartoonish way - Tucci is so blatantly creepy without a note of subtlety that his Oscar nomination just shows that if a studio invests enough in a Oscar campaign and the actor aggressively campaigns himself, even the laziest performance can be nominated. Wahlberg is miscast, looks lost and can't do anything remotely interesting with this material. Saoirse Ronan is out acted by the digital environment she spends most of this film in and Jackson seems less interested in modulating the performance from this young actress than playing with pixels. Nothing here works and that all boils down to the choices Jackson made.",The Lovely Bones
129,Meven_Stoffat,"Lovely in visuals, but Bones in storytelling.",6,10 January 2010,"Peter Jackson is a visual artist, albeit with a strange way of transitioning into Hollywood. He started off with a 4-years-in-the-making gore film called ""Bad Taste"", which was his debut. He has since then made a hilarious puppet satire called ""Meet the Feebles"", the goriest movie ever ""Dead Alive"", and disturbing drama, ""Heavenly Creatures"". What's strange is that in this wake, he managed to transition into Hollywood movies, beginning with ""The Frighteners"". Then came LOTR and King Kong. And now, The Lovely Bones walk among us.I, admittedly, have not read the book by Alice Sebold, but I do plan on reading it one day. I saw the trailer with a showing of ""The Boondock Saints II: All Saints Day"" and decided it looked good. So last night I sat down to watch The Lovely Bones, and prepared myself for a real experience. And after the movie was done, I thought it was good... but that's where it stopped. While this is gorgeous visually, unfortunately in terms of storytelling it seems rather weak. Which is a shame since this movie is one with much potential.The movie centers around Susie Salmon, a pretty girl who lives with her family in 1973. She is 14 and lives a very happy life. She is very interested in photography, and has developed quite a knack for it- She is seen taking pictures of herself, of her surroundings, of several things that are beautiful to her. She even has a crush on a handsome British guy named Ray, who sets up a meet-up in the gazebo at the local mall. One day, on her way home from school, she comes across an unsuspecting man named Mr. Harvey, who is a carpenter. He has built a fort for kids to hang out and decides to show it to her. While in the fort, Susie realizes she's being reeled into a trap, upon trying to escape, she has been murdered.Her family, after hearing of the news, has a hard time trying to accept it and let her go. At the same time, having grandma over sure is quite odd- but it doesn't seem to be filling in the gaping hole left in the family. Nobody knows that Mr. Harvey is the one who killed her. Yet at the same time, he does come off as quite suspicious. Whereas in the afterlife, Susie is in a mysterious and magical world, her definition of a ""perfect world"". She has met other murder victims there too. Yet somehow she manages to see her family, and her family manages to see her. But her dad, played by Mark Wahlberg, has a tough time letting her go.The Lovely Bones is quite a visual marvel- Jackson clearly has a great eye for shot and several of the film's scenes prove it. However, it's rather unfortunate that the story, while good, is rather weakly executed at best. It seems as if Jackson suddenly forgot what the story was and decided to fill in the blanks with some gorgeous CG. And while it is gorgeous, it can't make up for a bit of a lack in plot. It's lovely in visuals, but bones in storytelling, which does seem to drag the movie down a bit, because Jackson has managed to adapt Lord of the Rings and King Kong quite well.That isn't, however, to say the movie is bad. It's far from it. The main reason to see this, IMO, is the performances from Ronan and Sarandon- both manage to excel. Ronan in particular, though, manages to carry the well of Susie Salmon quite well and is one of the best performances in a while. Even Wahlberg, who, admit it, we're all getting tired of seeing nowadays, manages to do a good job. This may be one of the best performances from Wahlberg in forever. And Mr. Harvey's actor sure is excellent, and manages to pull off the psycho role well.In short, this movie was not bad and I enjoyed it, but be warned- don't look for the amazing level of entertainment Kong or LOTR gave us. It was worth watching, at least once, despite the rather convoluted way of telling the story.",The Lovely Bones
130,eddax,Might've been better served with a smaller budget,2,18 February 2010,"Here's a movie that would've been better served if it had had a smaller budget. Alice Sebold's book was a huge critical success so I assume the story is a good one (I've never read it) but the way Peter Jackson adapted it, punctuated with all the big budget special-effects laden sequences, the story's just not that cohesive anymore, and I wasn't moved by it as I should've been. Jackson might be able to put a huge budget to good use with fantasy novels but what a mess he's made of this small, affecting story. I wasn't too fond of the cast either. Saoirse Ronan did shine when she wasn't reacting to special effects, but I don't think Stanley Tucci did enough with his villain role to warrant the critical kudos he's received. Maybe it was an (overly) understated performance. I still maintain that Rachel Weisz's Oscar should've gone to Amy Adams that year and that Mark Wahlberg should stick to action movies. And what was with Susan Sarandon's role? I'm assuming her grandma character had more of a purpose in the book but here she comes across as mostly inappropriate comic relief.",The Lovely Bones
131,benoit-3,One More For The Sinkhole...,5,20 April 2010,"The sinkhole is an apt metaphor for this film. A lot of work, talent and money went in it but not much intelligence. Some will say it comes from adapting a novel and not showing enough respect for it (which Peter Jackson had managed to avoid in ""Lord of the Rings"" according to some). Others will say that it comes from stressing the visual elements and a rich tapestry of dream-like imagery at the risk of forgetting everything else. As a visual and musical poem, the film has a nice arc culminating in the faux Celtic version of Tim Buckley's ""Song To The Siren"" by This Mortal Coil, which, unfortunately, has nothing at all to do with the story but is sufficiently stoned-sounding to fit the film. Ah, the story... None of the characters make sense or develop in any rational way or ever show plausible motivation. They might as well be zombies controlled by the heroine from beyond the grave. Some simply fade in the background after aborting credible elements of a performance (the father and the mother) and some just disappear for no reason (Buckley). The rest act enigmatically, except for the Susan Sarandon character which is simply used for comic relief (a.k.a. cheap laughs). Not having read the novel but trusting in the more informed assessment of some posters here, I can only conclude that Peter Jackson did to this piece of writing what the bad neighbour did to poor Susie Salmon or worse. All in all, this film is a piece of self-indulgent atmospheric crap offering random relaxation music, occasional suspense and visual splendour (in spite of Peter Jackson's usual anaemic blue-saturated colours) but not much else to challenge the mind. This one is really ripe for the sinkhole. P.S.: By the way, how did the Stanley Tucci character ever get the safe out of his basement, up a creaky and steep wooden staircase and loaded onto a truck in record time with the police at his heels when he needed help later just dragging it along a flat surface? Superpowers? Divine intervention?",The Lovely Bones
132,Cedric_Catsuits,Trippy fluff,7,25 July 2011,"There is much to admire about this film. The non-fantasy scenes are well acted and well directed, and the story is compelling. Ronan is a striking young actor, although she can be a little too sickly sweet at times.Where the film goes wrong is in the strange fantasy sequences that are a bit too ""trippy"" to be considered suitable for a story dealing with a very serious and solemn subject, namely paedophilia and mass murder.In my opinion, portraying the souls of murdered children in such a fluffy and colourful light is insensitive. The monster who put them there is portrayed rather blandly, and his twisted character and actions seem inconsequential because of this.Whilst I appreciate the story is that of the children and not the monster, for me the reality and fantasy don't sit together well in this context. I also think the ending could have been handled better.Worth watching anyway, so you can make up your own minds.",The Lovely Bones
133,tburke85,The Lovely Bones A Decent Drama With Some Flaws,6,9 May 2010,"The Lovely Bones is a decent drama with some flaws from writer/director Peter Jackson the man behind the Lord Of The Rings trilogy. Jackson is admirable in making this movie but some flaws which I'll get into later weigh it down. Saoirse Ronan is very convincing as Susie Salmon a young girl whose murdered and watches over her family - and her killer - from heaven or as one character puts it ""Susie's in the in between."" Ronan gains our sympathy making you care about the journey her character goes on in the film. Well done. Mark Wahlberg turns in a solid performance as Susie's father Jack who's desperately searching for the answers to his daughter's brutal murder. Wahlberg may not win any awards and despite not being given a whole lot to do, he's still effective as the character none the less. Rachel Weisz is good as usual as Susie's grieving mother Abigail who's trying to move on after her daughter's disappearance and apparent murder. Weisz had nice chemistry with Wahlberg in their scenes together which made the relationship between their characters believable. Stanley Tucci is exceptionally creepy as the killer George Harvey so much so that I was glad to see he eventually gets what's coming to him. Tucci is quite effective as the villain a sociopath and pedophile who keeps you on edge through the subtle things he does in his limited screen time. It's a hard role to tackle but Tucci manages to bring this psychotic serial killer to life. A villain you can really despise and hope that he pays the price for his terrible crimes before the conclusion. Susan Sarandon does the best she can as Grandma Lynn providing a little comic relief in her short amount of screen time. Sarandon despite not being given a whole lot to do like Wahlberg still turns in a decent performance as a tough grandmother who likes to drink. It may not be Oscar worthy material but she does what her roles requires. The rest of the cast are okay in their cameos and brief extended appearances. The special effects for the place in between where Susie is trapped are very good if you can get past the fact that they're obviously CG. Now that I've told you what I did like about this film I'll get into the flaws I thought could've been improved making the movie as a whole better. Some of the characters aren't developed that well, the dialog wasn't the greatest at times, the humor felt off occasionally, and the ending while not the best was fitting for the film I guess. If Jackson had improved on these flaws I probably would've enjoyed it more than I did but it was still a decent movie overall. If you're looking for something different than The Lovely Bones will fit that bill. With it's flaws aside, The Lovely Bones has an interesting story, some character development, a little humor, and impressive performances by the cast (Wahlberg, Weisz, Ronan, and especially Tucci) who make this film worth watching at least once.",The Lovely Bones
134,revival05,"What Dreams May Come... or Nightmares... or... wait, what?",3,30 March 2010,"Ay, it goes all the way back to.. er, for the sake of the argument, let's say Hamlet. Maybe death ain't all that bad. ""To sleep, perchance to dream, ay there's the rub. For in that sleep of death, what dreams may come"". Peter Jackson's new movie The Lovely Bones tells the story of a 14 year old girl who is murdered by a child murderer cliché (Stanley Tucci) and then lives on in a limbo between life and death until she's ready to move along. That's the premise. Now, I'm not necessarily opposed to that premise. There are many ways this movie can play out. Unfortunately, Peter Jackson takes every possible route he can find simultaneously at once. I guess you might wonder: Does the girl make contact with her parents? Well, sorta. Does she feel sad about being dead at 14? Well.... sorta... Does she help them discover her murderer? Weeell... sorta. All that is certain is that she spends a lot of time stare into a cryptic nothingness, when she's not running in slow motion. Meanwhile, her dad (Mark Wahlberg) goes insane, for a while, I think... sorta. Her mom (Rachel Weisz) gets burnt out, sorta, and leaves, kind of. A little sad, you think? Not to worry! We have a comic relief grandma, Susan Sarandon, a funny alcoholic who takes care of the kids in a wacky montage. I kid you not. This is the bipolar state of this movie.I mean, to begin with, a 14 year old girl getting murdered by a creepy old sociopath is, well, what I'd call a touchy subject. You better know what you get yourself into when you are to tell this story (and yes, I'm ignoring the fact it's based on a book. That should never be an excuse for any movie, nor into consideration upon reviewing it). But Jackson, with his usual screenwriters Walsh/Boyens, have created the most baffling and inconsiderate screenplay I've seen in a long time. The speechy dialogue is about as believable as if Lord of the Rings would have been a modern day story, and the movie is eagerly directed as if there's really an urgency to tell this story. Little Suzie Salmon (aww) is jumping around heavenly fields and talks poetically through voice-over about the wonders of life and death. The elephant in the room is constantly the fact that this girl has been MURDERED. You know, as a human being you tend to imagine her cold, stale and dead, rotting away somewhere. It kind of goes with the conception of child molestation and murder, or maybe that's just me. Had she just died for some random reason, it wouldn't have been a problem, I guess. It would still be sappy, of course, but at least not incomprehensible. Naturally, that would be another movie so never mind.Stanley Tucci's murderer is never given any point of origin or any significant cause. He barely even gets a story line of his own. You want him to get what's coming to him? Or maybe you manage to feel some kind of sympathy with him? In any case that's too bad, because the movie is frankly uninterested in him and his character arch is barely even finished. This is not a serial killer movie. There's a cop there, but it's not a thriller. There's high school romance, but the movie isn't about adolescence. There's the grieving parents, but the movie says really nothing about believable family problems. There's a girl on the other side, yet this is not an other-side ghost story either. The movie just goes on and on, first this happens, then that. There's sappy moments and there's some scary ones. It doesn't matter. It consists of nothing. The movie is a mess. They could have cut down on the sugar and made it realistic. They could have developed the murder into a plot and made a thriller. They could have set up some kind of direct contact with the dead girl and the parents to make a ghost story. They could have avoided the murder to make it easier to swallow. They could have done... SOMETHING... but they did it all, eagerly, and came out with a movie that I recommend nobody to see.Also. The name of the killer is Mr. Harvey, and Stanley Tucci does the role with a fairly blatant James Stewart impression.... Huh?",The Lovely Bones
135,Rindiana,Bone-Headed,3,25 November 2010,"If there needs to be one last proof of Peter Jackson having been artistically spoilt by his Lord of the Rings megalomania, this interesting companion piece to Jackson's wonderful ""Heavenly Creatures"" is that very evidence.Whereas the earlier pic was subtle and reserved in its use of special effects to lead the viewer into the girls's fantasy world, here it's all bombast and sledgehammer symbolism, with our raped and killed teen angel wandering through corny CGI landscapes that would even the makers of the Robin Williams bomb ""What Dreams May Come"" blush of shame.But what's even worse: the dark thriller subplot, the tragicomic family drama and the above-mentioned afterlife scenes don't gel at all and remain strictly superficial and listless, one might even add tasteless and vulgar.The first half hour is acceptable, the rest is rubbish.3 out of 10 stupid police investigations",The Lovely Bones

Wasn't really looking forward to seeing this, altho I was interested.It starts fairly interesting, actors are mostly good. I'm not sure if Mark Wahlberg was the correct choice for this, but he was OK. Not 100 % sure about Tucci either, but the rest of the cast was good. Ronan packs potential to be a star of the future.Like said, I haven't read the book so I don't know how it's structured, but this movie seemed very uneven and unbalanced at times. Pretty much nothing in the script feels connected to each other. Maybe the point is the randomness of it all, but to me it was just confusing. There is just so much I could complain about, like the girl who ""saw dead people"", her part was a very minor one in the end. The whole grandma character, which to me felt as if it was just a comical relief amidst an otherwise grim movie, could've easily been left off the whole movie.I just think there was too much going on and the movie fooled around with too many genres and too many script elements, it should've been better concentrating on a simple plot and either being a drama, horror or pure fantasy. There was this movie ""What Dreams May Come (1998)"" which in a way suffered from the same symptoms of being overly grim for wide audience, but in the end didn't really know what genre it wanted to be.Visually the movie is pretty good, but I felt as if the CGI scenes didn't serve much purpose. The colorful 70's hippie vibe was cool and well styled, but a bit cartoony.In the end I was kind of just happy that it was over and I could delete it from dtv hd.

It's not as effective nor as shocking as the first. This one still manages to blend fantasy and horror together with some powerful performances especially from Tucci as a pedophile. The storytelling is assured and effective and the visuals are dynamic. Though Jackson is still engaging in parody of his previous film. It's not bad though and does manage to entertain if not enthrall the audience. The performances are the glue that hold this mixed bag together.

139,rparham,"Some very lacking ""Bones""",5,21 February 2010,"After taking on the epic challenges of The Lord of the Rings trilogy and a remake of King Kong, director Peter Jackson turned his attentions to a ""smaller"" project, an adaptation of Alice Sebold's best selling novel of life, death and the after-life, The Lovely Bones. I have not read the novel, so it is impossible for me to know how closely it hews to the book's narrative, but the film that has emerged starts out strong in it's first 30 or so minutes, and then, unfortunately, loses focus, emotional resonance and audience empathy in the rest of it's running length.The Lovely Bones begins by giving the audience a glimpse at the early life of Susie Salmon (Saoirse Ronan), a girl who loves photography, has a strong bond with her Grandmother (Susan Sarandon) and builds glass bottle ships with her father (Mark Wahlberg). On the eve of an emotional connection, and plans for a first date, with a boy she is attracted to at school, Susie falls victim to a neighbor, George Harvey (Stanley Tucci), who turns out to be a murderer who lures Susie to a supposed playhouse he has built for her and her friends under a cornfield, but which instead turns out to be the site of her murder at Harvey's hands. Following her death (which occurs offscreen), Susie ends up in a day-glow afterlife, where she connects with another dead soul, Holly (Nikki SooHoo) and engages in fun and games with her, meanwhile, her earthbound family, whom she can still see trying to go about their lives, unsuccessfully, begins to unravel: her father is on a personal search for the killer, her mother (Rachel Weisz) leaves the family to become a farm worker in California, and her sister, while navigating her teenage years, begins to suspect that George Harvey had something to do with her sister's disappearance.The first section of The Lovely Bones works well, introducing us to Susie, showing us her interests, her special relationship with her grandmother, her bonding with her father, saving her younger brother from a near tragedy (bookended with a somewhat funny sequence where she tries to drive him to a hospital), and culminates with the first stirrings of interest with the boy she is attracted to. Much of this segment of the film provides a nice slice of life story of a teenage girl on the cusp of becoming an adult, and Susie proves an engaging character. After a tense, suspenseful sequence where she is cornered by Harvey in his underground chamber, however, the film loses interest and steam.Almost all the sequences in which Susie explores her ""perfect world"" of the afterlife are, pardon the pun, lifeless, an amalgam of visual effects that go nowhere and provide no additional development to Susie, and her scenes with Holly are equally pointless, with that character completely undeveloped. Meanwhile, the film fails to adequately handle the devastating loss that Susie's disappearance, and presumed death, causes the rest of her family. Jackson powers through scenes of her family attempting to cope with their loss, but the characters are so flat, so lacking in depth, that we can work up little or no empathy for them. The film glosses over her sister's maturing years, giving her a boyfriend who doesn't have a name, turns her grandmother into the star of a montage scene showing how terrible a housekeeper she is without really making her feelings on Susie's loss known, and her brother almost completely disappears from the proceedings altogether.What is worse, however, is the message the film seems to be leaving us with, exacerbated by it's almost rote dealings with Susie's death: a loved one's death, no matter how tragic, painful, or otherwise torturous, and in this case, largely unsolved, is just no big deal. You'll get over it, no harm, no foul. By only paying lip service to the family's loss, and not really dealing with it in a reasonable manner, Jackson and his screen writing partners Phillipa Boyen and Fran Walsh almost trivialize the death of Susie, helped along with the ""afterlife"" scenes. How can we connect with the family's pain, when we are faced with her in scene after scene, frolicking in a CG-infused wonderland like her death was just no big deal? This is where The Lovely Bones missteps so significantly to render the film almost offensive.The only actor who really distinguishes himself in The Lovely Bones is Stanley Tucci as Harvey. Tucci, especially in his scene with Susie in the underground ""playroom"" he constructed, hits just the right note of discomfort, mixed with nebbishness, to make George Harvey a man who instantly proves off-putting while seeming on the surface to be just shy. As with most of the other characters, Harvey is underdeveloped, but Tucci's performance still makes Harvey an interesting character. Saoirse Ronan is the only other performance of note, mostly in her pre- death scenes, where she infuses Susie with an inquisitive energy and strong spirit, but can't really do much with her latter scenes in the after-life. Everyone else, from the usually terrific Rachel Weisz to Mark Wahlberg and Susan Sarandon, turn in limp, flaccid performances that fail to make their characters, unhelped by the script, into memorable people.Perhaps The Lovely Bones is another instance where a literary smash was just beyond the grasp of the filmmakers, even one as capable as Peter Jackson, to turn into a strong film. It is difficult to believe that a novel as popular as The Lovely Bones was so lacking in value that the film adequately represents what was on the written page. Either way, the film version of The Lovely Bones is a significant disappointment, and one you can only hope that Peter Jackson will correct with whatever will be his next film.",The Lovely Bones

No so with the indignity of watching a relatively good story falter under preposterous CGI and fantasy realms of the INBETWEEN.The film gives a indirect look into a murdered 14 yr old's transition from life through death into heaven. It gives a nurturing, peaceful look to how she watches her family and killer, but can't make the leap yet. Mark Wahlberg does an ok, mediocre job as the father Jack Salmon, Rachel Weisz is barely adequate as the grieving mother Abigail. Throw in a alcoholic mother played by Susan Sarandon and the film is but a stiff reminder of child's death. Stanley Tucci comes across creepy, but simple as this killer who has taken many lives.

I have not read the book and Ithink this film has been criticised for peter jacksons directing similar to director of Time Travllers Wife. Overall I thought the film entertained and told a 'story' but yes it did disappoint quite a bit (but not from the entertainment standpoint). Certainly raised some questions.Who was Ruth supposed to be? Some sort of angel? Didn't get it Why didn't the police do a more thorough investigation (with dogs),knowing they had found clothing (and body parts?) of the dead girl in the cornfield didn't the family dog barking at mr harveys house suggest this should have been worked more? when did we see the family dog again? why did the sisters boyfriend really duff up Mr Wahlberg and why were the couple in the cornfield anyway at that time/ I am not being naive here, I don't think For a guy who was security conscious, that little window which gave illegal access to the sister was bizarre to say the least susan sarandon gave the most overplayed character of the year as the eccentric Grandmother, didn't fit the sad storyline, so sensitivity at all, though good acting but not needed here Why wasn't Ray seen Tobe e questioned? What was the point of the gazebo/ weren't they supposed to meet at the gazebo at the Mall? The big one which got me at the end was the disposal of the safe. Mr Harvey was clearly a loner - but how did he get the bloody thing into the car into the first place all by himself? Then having got to the waste disposal area and having bribed the guy, why didn't he park the vehicle nearer to make it easier to get rid of the thing? It all looked over-suspicious to me.And what was Ruth really doing there? didn't get it As for the iceberg, yes, I got that! And didn't need to watch the film a second time, although i will certainly do so Might get nominated for best picture in Oscars but doubt anything else. I would agree peter jackson has done better and might have messed this one up, we will all have an opinion about that.the story is a very good one but I am really disappointed, unlike in Eastwoods Changeling for example, that there is not more obvious effort to find the girl firstly and then find her killer.Earlier comment is right.

143,jemps918,"Best executed raw. Leave out the CGI, please!",5,18 February 2010,"Based on Alice Sebold's bestselling novel, The Lovely Bones is about 14-year old Susie Salmon, played by Oscar Best Supporting Actress nominee Saoirse Ronan (Atonement), who has been killed but isn't ready to go to heaven yet. Instead, she haplessly watches over her father Jack, played by Oscar Best Supporting Actor nominee Mark Wahlberg (The Departed), her mother Abigail, played by Oscar Best Supporting Actress winner Rachel Weisz (The Constant Gardener), her sister Lindsay (Rose McIver), and her murderer from limbo, where she works out her strong need for revenge and for her family to recover from her death.Joining the powerhouse cast is Stanley Tucci, who is nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his role as the creepy George Harvey, while Oscar Best Actress winner Susan Sarandon (Dead Man Walking) lends oddly out-of-place comic relief as Grandma Lynn.It was a surprise that Oscar winning director Peter Jackson (LOTR trilogy, King Kong, District 9) took on this family drama, but it's an unpleasant one (perhaps he's taking a break from his sci-fi films?). No doubt the cast and crew are all talented but I believe he ruined the story with the oppressive, uncalled for CGI. The surreal special effects were unnecessary and did not help the story at all, jarring whatever emotions the characters have tried to evoke from the audience. The story is better told in its raw state. I have not read the critically-acclaimed book but I can imagine how its readers must be cringing from its movie reincarnation.

Where most bad films dress as bad films, with lousy direction and ugly camera-work, Peter Jackson's latest dons some impressive threads. His cinematography is tight and nuanced. He lines up fine performances and crafts sequences that independently excel; yet somehow the conglomerate film all but implodes. More often than not, Jackson flat-out misses the point.His ideas are frankly juvenile and ""Lovely Bones"" lacks bite even given its PG-13 rating. The film is based on the novel by Alice Sebold, about fourteen year-old murder victim Susie Salmon (Saoirse Ronan), who observes her healing family from the Heavenly equivalent of limbo while learning to come to terms with death herself. What feels as though it should be a solemn contemplation on loss is often punctuated by staunchly optimistic tonal aberrations. When Jackson has an underage driver and her asphyxiating brother on his hands, he somehow can't help but romanticize their spin in the family convertible. The kids blow by mom (Rachel Weisz) and dad (Mark Wahlberg), who shoot each other a clueless ""couldn't be!"" sort of look straight out of ""Home Alone."" Or later, there's a rockin' seventies montage where boozy grandma (Susan Sarandon) charmingly ruins dinner and botches the laundry, turning the washroom into a sudsy dance floor for she and her grandson. Really.It's moments like these that underscore the weird dichotomy of ""Lovely Bones."" It's a movie about murder in which we never witness a murder, and a movie about grieving in which grieving, when explored at all, amounts to euphemistic cliché. Dad smashes his precious ship-in-a-bottle collection in a fit of rage; mom leaves home for California to pick oranges or something; Grandma lights another cigarette; Susie's siblings don't seem much bothered at all.You'll have to bear with me if this next comparison seems inapt, but I've been watching a lot of ""Twin Peaks,"" and the early-nineties TV series is a perfect counterpoint to Jackson's sentimentality. The premises are nearly identical, with murdered teens prompting police inquiry and family crises. Mark Frost and David Lynch's series, however, dredges its characters to the precarious edge of hell in their grief, reducing Laura Palmer's parents to shrieking, sobbing loons. By comparison, the Salmons are positively stoic. Their grief is never made palpable, and so our emotional investment in their story is compromised.If this leads one to ask where the drama went, or what was pulling Peter Jackson's heartstrings in taking on the film, the answer is abundantly clear--it's the lavish effects sequences. I can imagine no other reason the project piqued his interest, and he makes his priorities known even at the expense of a more focused film. He easily loses himself in spherical digital meadows, bottled ship smattered oceans, and all manner of other vaguely surreal and uniformly irrelevant scenes.The thesis of the film, that new life and new connections foster in death, that there is beauty even in unspeakable horror, I find compelling. It's probably the reason for Jackson's bleating optimism in sequences like those described above, misguided though it may be. He stretches for the positive, even when a downer is what we really need. Holding the audience at arms length, he spoon-feeds us everything except the part of the story that's actually important. It's sort of weird to show Susie Salmon frolicking in a pristine garden after her death; it undercuts the gravity of what's been done to her. To juxtapose heaven with hell on earth is really the only way for the film to work, and Jackson doesn't have the gall to honestly portray the wrenching emotion of the scenario. From an objective film-making standpoint, he makes an admirable jab, but he simply isn't making the right movie.",The Lovely Bones
147,loco_73,Lovely Disturbing,8,21 January 2010,"I have a hard time discussing a movie that deals with such a heavy and even terrible subject matter as this movie does. However I find that ""The Lovely Bones"" is a movie that is worthwhile to comment on and share a few thoughts and ideas about it, especially given some of the reviews I have seen, read and heard on TV, in print and on radio. Some of those reviews have definitely permeated here on IMDb with no exception. While everybody is entitled to their opinions and most definitely the right not to like this movie, I must say that I find many of the reviews quite shortsighted, shallow and without merit.Though taste is obviously a highly subjective concept, ""The Lovely Bones"" was a beautiful, disturbing and haunting movie. It eschews the typical Hollywood happy-ending and neat explanations so many in the viewing audiences seem to crave and need in these turbulent, uncertain times. But the movie seems to accurately capture that feeling of profound loss and deep penetrating tragedy, which are unfortunately part of all our lives at one point or another. Sooner or later we will all experience an episode in our lives that will forever transform us, for no life, no matter how mundane is ever linear. That is what made viewing this movie so unsettling for me.The ambient the film creates is dark, quite dark, deeply melancholic and sad. Peter Jackson has rendered his artistry once again, just like he did with ""Heavenly Creatures"", ""The Frighteners"" and the LOTR trilogy. He has a knack for penetrating deep into our subconscious and moving our insides like chess pieces he is in full control of. The movie is NOT perfect, but it is a solid body of work, from direction, screenplay, cinematography, CGI/F/X and the whole cast.I have to give a special mention to Saoirse Ronan who played the title character of Susie Salmon. Here is another example of a talented, non-pretentious, feet-on-earth, child actor, that is slowly growing and maturing into a future great actor. If she keeps up the good work, a good head on her shoulders and bides her time, this girl will be one to watch in the future. She has such a captivating and unforgettable presence on-screen, that I think she captured the essence of her character.Now I find myself quite conflicted in giving praise to an actor that portrays a paedophile and child murderer. However Stanley Tucci does a tremendous job with what has to be a horrendous, unsympathetic, ugly and hateful character. He gives a truly chilling performance with his understated horror and savagery and his barely contained lust and predatory instincts. Not since Robin Williams's portrayal of a deeply disturbed individual in ""One Hour Photo"", or Kevin Spacey's terribly calm serial killer in ""Se7en"", have I seen the portrayal of such a matter-of-fact evil.The rest of the cast, Mark Whalberg, Rachel Weisz and Susan Sarandon don't disappoint either, nor do the rest of the actors I have not mentioned here.As to the many criticisms against the movie I have seen, they range from the fact that Peter Jackson has lost his touch, his nerve, that he sugarcoated the movie, didn't capture the horror of the murder, glossed over the details, did not get the essence of the book, so on and so forth... To this I have to say...are you kidding me?!?!?!? I thought the movie was dark and disturbing enough! I think that he conveyed the message and the movie without creating an unduly grisly and gory film! What would have been the point of it? I don't know about the rest of you but I don't particularly feel the need to sit through a movie which will give me a detailed and prolonged scene in which a child is raped, murdered and then cut to pieces. The scene that showed Susie's murder is MORE than enough to portray that event, without going in to excruciatingly painful details, of which I have no desire to see. For that I will read the novel.People read the novel and their minds create a certain image of how both the characters should look, story should unfold etc. But we should all remember that a movie director can only give his interpretation, his vision of a novel. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. In this case it worked quite effectively. Peter Jackson continues to impress me, just like he managed to leave such a deep and lasting effect with his cinematic masterpiece, the unequalled ""The Lord Of The Rings"" trilogy.",The Lovely Bones
148,Mike-DD,"Not bad, but not great either, considering its source",6,18 March 2014,"After considering that the book was critically acclaimed, one would think with such great material, a great movie would be made. Alas, what read well did not translate properly onto screen.Perhaps part of the reason is the seeming difficulty in separating the living and afterlife landscapes in such a way that they are distinct yet subtly connected. You can imagine it well enough in the book, but when faced with it on the screen, you lose the ethereal feeling you get from the book.The story is also unevenly paced. After a well-paced beginning, the tempo shifts so the result is a jarring mental awkwardness as we try to modulate our emotions according to the scene's mood at the time. Some scenes were too frivolous for what I expected from this film, like when Susie is enjoying herself in her afterlife world while not being able to let go of it. But I did like the way the film used visual metaphors, like when the father breaks the ships-in-bottles and there are giant ships-in-bottles being smashed in Susie's afterlife world.The acting was for the most part good - the actors did well with what they had. I did find it irritating whenever Saoirse Ronan used a breathy voice though. Mark Wahlberg is excellent in this film. He has a range that belies his origins. Too bad he doesn't have more to work with here.",The Lovely Bones
149,tapio_hietamaki,Wasn't as bad as I expected,7,5 July 2013,"Based on reviews I thought this would be a tacky trainwreck full of needless CGI. Well, it wasn't quite as bad as that. The film does stray away from genuine emotion in favor of painting digital landscapes suitable for desktop wallpapers. The film would have been visually more pleasing (at least to me) if they had just used actual props. Still, it's nowhere near as bad as some sequences in Peter Jackson's King Kong.The story and its emotional weight mostly depends on Mark Wahlberg, who's very good in the role of a worrying dad. The 70's haircut and clothes actually suit him surprisingly well. Saoirse Ronan is a cute girl but a little too ethereal and spooky to be really relatable.The storytelling stumbles a bit. The ""heaven"" sequences constantly contradict each other and don't make much sense. Why is she first happy, then becomes really sad, then becomes really happy again when some ghosts show up? I guess the book might hold answers to these questions but I feel the film just left me hanging a lot of times.In the end, the film carries a surprisingly adult message that sometimes you don't get closure and justice just isn't served in every case, and we just have to deal with it and move on anyway, no matter how difficult or unfair it might seem.",The Lovely Bones
150,hoytyhoyty,"Emotionless, over-stated and far, far too long",1,22 March 2015,"That's it, Peter Jackson can't direct films.I really think 'Heavenly Creatures' was his only good shot at 'art', and even it seems overblown and pretentious now looking back. 'The Frighteners' was fun, somehow the screenplay just worked. Honestly, I still think his best film was 'Bad Taste', at least I got - and still get - a laugh out of it.I knew I was going to regret watching this, after reading around and hearing some friends' reactions to it. And I did.Jackson desperately wants to be Gilliam - and I really think Terry himself had only a handful of winners; most of his too were just money thrown at the screen over very muddy, confused screenplays.Here with 'The Lovely Bones' we see some of the same, Spielbergian ham-fistedness Jackson dealt the LOTR trilogy (and shades of the murder he inflicted on 'The Hobbit').For a start, the totally arbitrary cast: Stanley Tucci - a genius actor. He is the only interesting thing in the entire film and he barely has enough material to support it.Mark Wahlberg - what was he doing in this? He's a good actor, and I've really liked him in some of his works. But here, he could have been anyone. He is given no direction whatsoever, and his lines descend into cliché at many points.Susan Sarandon - an 'OK' actor, doing one of the two roles she is capable of playing, but again she has no impact on the film just as Wahlberg doesn't. Her character also serves almost no plot-purpose except comic relief. Which would have been OK, but the rest of the film is so slow that the audience actually resents more of their time being wasted.Rachael Weisz - cannot act her way out of a paper bag, and her character is just an awful cardboard cut-out. She isn't the single thing that wrecks the film, but she really is a blight on the whole production.And then the miles and miles of computer graphics: Here we go. Let's be Spielberg and substitute spending production company money for artistic ability. The audience won't notice. Let's try and be Gilliam; GOOD LUCK PETER! You haven't got even his level of talent! What's really amazing about this film, is that it tries to make a giant emotional point... yet not only fails to tell us what this point might be, it comes across as utterly emotionless itself! I left it unmoved, save for being mildly irritated. It doesn't engage, it just pontificates - AT you - about nothing.I haven't read the book, and this film is certainly an anti-inspiration to do so. Is it trying to talk about being set-aside and forgotten, once you are dead? OK then why have any interaction with the real world, at all? Is it a revenge story? Is it a 'family is everything' feel-good message? Is it some deep point about reality and what's beyond?? TELL US, PETER/AUTHOR, TELL US! Stop just waffling around in circles over and over again. There are all these moments dotted throughout the ponderous thing where everything builds - the scenery, the music, the facial expressions; and you're SURE that something big is about to happen! And it doesn't. And it doesn't. And it doesn't, again! The whole thing could have had about 40 minutes edited out of it, and still maintained the flow and continuity. In other words, there is 40 minutes - possibly more - of material that just DOESN'T need to be there! Not for plot, not for mood, not for creating impact later, not for nothing! Padding padding padding! And the clichéd afterlife/plot development/teenage love moments just kept coming. It was a case of hold your head and grit your teeth: No! They're NOT going there! No don't do it DON'T DO IT!! But they did. Ohh they did. I could imagine the groans in the cinema (I caught this off Blu-Ray. And still felt ripped-off).The only reasons I've given it 4 stars instead of 1, are: * You could see the 'thread' of a movie that might have existed, in it. All through it, like a ghost peeping through a window, bits of this other film kept showing up. Just before the disappointment came, you were given this hope that the quality was rising.* The computer eye candy was gorgeous. Gorgeous! But it belonged in a Warp Records or 4AD film-clip. It was wasted on this w*nk fest.* The Brian Eno/Jon Hopkins soundtrack. Again wasted. They included some ingenious remixes and re-loopings of Eno's earlier work, as well. Such a pity. It reminds me of all the god-awful 80s action films that Tangerine Dream did brilliant soundtracks to.And I have one final kick in the groin for Peter Jackson: yes, including yourself in the film is an acceptable trademark, we're fine with it. But really was the 2nd shot necessary just to make sure you got seen?? I hope somebody delivered said scrotal kick for this offense.The Lovely Bones.Don't see it.- -- --",The Lovely Bones
151,tequila101,Still one of the Greatest films ever made,10,3 March 2012,"I have seen the Lovely Bones at least three times now and I have to say that watching for the 3rd time last night, I truly enjoyed it just as much more as I did watching it twice two years ago when it first came out in the cinemas. I believe that this film is realistic because it brings out the feel of reality meeting fantasy, it touches the raw nerves of the viewer and the twists in the film can become emotional.Quick story short, The Lovely Bones is about a girl called Sussie Salmon who is murdered by an old man called Mr. Harvey. When she dies, she looks down at her family, friends and killer from Heaven. If she doesn't move on, her family will be in much strife and her killer will succeed in getting away with cold, blooded murder. If she does move on from the past, good things will start to unfold.I love the overall tone of the entire film. It's got that creepy, scary factor going for it and the fantasy aspects peeping through. I believe the acting was quite believable and at most convincing enough to care for the ones who were going through some tough issues. I also love the musical score played throughout. I truly thought that put a spark on the film. I also liked many of the scenes. They were structured quite well along with the scenes where Susie was traveling to Heaven. I thought the different landscapes of snows, grass lands and forests was an awesome spin onto what Heaven might look like.In conclusion, (not spoiling anything) The Lovely Bones is a true masterpiece and I think it should be an instant classic. Peter Jackson really makes this film come to life and I felt weird watching it the first time since he makes some very bizarre films such as ""The Feebles"" and ""Bad Taste"". When I came into this film, I was expecting some gory splattery effects to happen. That wasn't the case here. Here we have something that is very real life like. BTW the computer graphics were actually OK.But yes, Please see this film. Who ever says it's ""Bad"" or ""crap"" don't know a good film when they see one.9.5/10",The Lovely Bones
152,Barky44,"A bit poignant, a bit teary ... and a bit disjointed",6,23 January 2010,"First, before I write anything else, let me just say that, as a guy, I'm going to try my best to give a review for a film that really is targeted at women. More specifically, I think this film is targeted at young girls age 12-16, and at women with daughters or who wish they had daughters. I think that good communication, including books, film, music, photography, sculpture, or even Powerpoint presentations to corporate weasels, is built around the target audience. The target audience here isn't the Avatar crowd or the Fast and the Furious crowd or even the Lord of the Rings crowd. This film is targeted at the Thelma and Louise crowd and the Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants crowd and folks who spend hours making costumes for their daughter's part in the school play. And that's fine, everyone should have a voice at the local cinema.So here's my best shot at a review for a film out of my particular ... um ... idiom?The Lovely Bones is a story centered around a young girl who is viciously murdered by a psychopath. However, the movie isn't about that itself, in fact the film mercifully skirts around the harshness of that act. I was very afraid of what the great Monster Director, Peter Jackson, would do with that, and was greatly relieved when the film only eluded to it, but didn't show it outright. Violence against children is an abomination of the worst sort, and if the film reveled in it, I would not only have given the film a ""1"" but would have flown to New Zealand at great personal expense to kick his ass. As it was, watching a film essentially about pedophiles is creepy. I couldn't help but wonder how many of them were in the audience. Brrrrr, just got a chill there.Anyway, what the film IS about is how a family recovers from a great tragedy. The point of view is that of the murdered girl herself as she hangs on in purgatory and watches the family ... and the killer ... carry on with their lives. She is caught in a world of allegory and symbolism, images from her life and the lives of others are juxtaposed with those from what her life might have been and what perceptions of heaven she might have. There's a lot of tricky business in there if you pay attention to it, but, like any film heavy on symbolism, The Lovely Bones overdoes it from time to time, occasionally with ridiculous results. This isn't as bad as the horrid ""What Dreams May Come"" (1998), but still can be trying for those not into that sort of thing.That part of the film is the visually interesting part. The emotional part of the film revolves around the girl's reaction to her own death and the way she views the lives of her surviving family. She is a 14-year-old girl watching the destruction, reconstruction, and redemption of her family in the wake of a terrible tragedy. There are a lot of poignant and teary moments in this film, either direct or implied. There are also some fine bits of acting by Mark Wahlberg (as the bereaved father).What's interesting here is the writing: they are trying to write from a 14-year-old viewpoint, which would not necessarily be mature, or broad, or accurate. This is not an insult against 14-year-olds, I've known a lot of intelligent 14-year-old girls, but regardless of intelligence, they do lack the depth and breadth that can only come from living a few years. The writers capture this well, in fact too well, which is why I think this film has received a lot of bad reviews on IMDb and elsewhere. This is the spirit of a kid talking. It may not always make sense. Remember there are plenty of intelligent 14-year-old girls who like the Jonas Brothers or Twilight. The heroine is bright but not omniscient or focused. Remember that when seeing this film.So now I'm going to explain why I'm only giving this movie a 6. Being a PJ fan, I wanted to give it more, but this film has a lot of problems.First, the film focuses on the dad (Wahlberg), but gives short-shrift to the mom (the normally outstanding Rachel Weisz). She does have some moments of grief and terror that would be expected, but they really relegated her to a supporting actor role, and that's a shame. This may also be in-line with 14-year-old thinking, in my own observations girls of that age tend to think of their father as their protector, and have less-than-friendly relations with their mother, so maybe it is wholly appropriate for this girl's focus to be on the father. But still, it's discouraging.Then there's the over-the-top part of the grandmother (played by Susan Sarandon). This character is a caricature seen so often: boozing, smoking, unable to vacuum or do laundry, basically there for supposed comic relief and the big ""talking to"" moment in the end. I found it out of place, it really doesn't work at all in this film, and great parts of it should have hit the cutting room floor or been rewritten and reshot entirely.There are also some plot points that don't work, some time syncing stuff that doesn't work (I couldn't figure out whether a week has passed or a year has passed or a month has passed), and there's one glaringly bad special effects moment that spells FAIL (shame on you, Weta Digital!).All in all, I think The Lovely Bones as a film will end up just like the main character declares at the end, paraphrased as ""we all eventually drift away, and life continues without us"".",The Lovely Bones
153,cosmorados,why does no-one in this movie have any sense of perspective,4,4 December 2010,"Susie Salmon is dead. Murdered by a neighbour who appears to all intents and purposes as a normal, if solitary, figure. But although she is dead she is trapped in the space in-between and is able to see the devastated life she left behind.Thus begins one of the most wasteful films I have ever had the misfortune to watch. The Actors all do their jobs well enough and during a few moments the Director does manage to create a genuine sense of tension, terror and fear, but the problem seem to be with either the source material or the adapted script. The characters seem to have no sense of perspective at key moments. For instance when the younger sister finds the book that proves who actually killed her elder sibling when she gets home she wastes valuable seconds handing the book over because her Mum has come home. WHAT??? It was like whoever wrote that seemed to have absolutely no sense of family or the desire for revenge that anyone would have if anybody hurt their family members. But the biggest waste was surely the end when getting a snog is more important than catching your murderer. I don't know if this lack of perspective is due to the script or the original book but it just seemed so wishy washy in parts compared with how good it was in others and the ending just seemed to be an empty tag on by writers clearly wanting to give the audience some kind of happy ending rather than having the guts to give the audience the grim ending that the makers seemed to want.Disappointing fayre.",The Lovely Bones

In a movie like this, the acting should have been moving. It wasn't. I really didn't feel like these characters were going through much of anything at all. That shouldn't have been the case. Mark Wahlberg, in particular, needs some help here. I think he needs to take an acting class or otherwise go back to playing the beat 'em up, shoot 'em up mindless action hero he seems to like to play.Too much CGI. A little bit of CGI goes a long way. It's like a piece of cheesecake. If you get too much of it, you're going to get a stomachache. That's exactly how I felt during this movie. I just felt like the CGI disconnected the characters from each other. I didn't feel much interaction between certain characters at all, namely because of the fact they weren't interacting. You'd have some actors filming a scene in the ""real world"" and then the main character, Susie Salmon, in some purgatory-esque CGI land...Ugh! There was no flow between scenes. I had this same complaint about ""Twilight"", another book-to-movie adaptation whose screenplay wasn't written by the original author -- not that it would've mattered in either case since I don't think the source material was good in itself. I didn't feel like I was watching a movie but rather just a collection of individual scenes stuck together. It just felt all cheaply spliced together.The ending was just unforgivable...You've got a guy whose been going around killing young girls and he is never found out for his crimes. He's never tried in court, never convicted, never sentenced to death or at least life in prison...Instead, an icicle takes him out and he falls backwards over a cliff like something out of a damn Wiley E. Coyote/Road Runner cartoon.Whoever chose the music for this movie was an idiot, too. The fact that a song came out in the 70s and the story takes place in the 70s doesn't mean they automatically go together. The songs used just didn't fit the mood of the movie. Horribly bad soundtrack choices. There are plenty of 70s songs that would've been better than the ones they chose. Horrible! In closing, this movie was a mess. I can't believe the same guy who directed ""Lord of the Rings"" directed it. Even more shocking, or maybe not so shocking based off his work in recent years, is the fact Steven Spielberg was an executive producer of this turd.Avoid this movie at all costs!",The Lovely Bones
156,jonnyfendi,Sympathy is the Power!,7,17 April 2010,"""The Lovely Bones"" is based on a best-selling novel which is written by Alice Sebold. The story is about a girl named Susie who has been murdered and her confusion between heaven and earth. If you have seen the trailer before, the movie offers tremendous images of heaven. But, after I have watched it, substantively I do not find the surprising element on that description. The heaven's images have similarity on what we have already seen in ""What Dreams May Come"" (1998). But in the other hand, I think the movie successfully delivers the drama in a romantic and beautiful way. The essence of the story is simple, but we can clearly feel the brittleness and sorrow around the characters. The narration and glimpse of the Susie's past in the beginning brings us sufficient mood to build sympathy. The Scene that involves Suzie and her boyfriend Brian (Jack Kebel) is a scene stealer in thiz movie. Thiz is a recent movie that is directed by Peter Jackson, one of the greatest Directors in our time. Peter Jackson is widely known for his previous movies like the trilogy of ""Lord of the Rings"" (2001-2003) and the remake of ""King Kong"" (2005). Susie Salmon is played by Saoirse Ronan. Previously, Ronan has made her promising debut in a great drama ""Atonement"" in 2007. Mark Wahlberg and Rachel Weisz are played as her parents and Susan Sarandon as her grandmother. The villain is played convincingly by Stanley Tucci. I think Saoirse Ronan has a potential skill to become greater Actress in the future, even greater than the other rising star Dakota Fanning. We will be seeing more of her great performances in the future.Visit My Blog on JONNY'S MOVEE : http://jonnyfendi.blogspot.com",The Lovely Bones

I know white people kept their homes unlocked in some places because they trusted their neighborhoods. Why didn't at least one of the parents pick her up from school every day?! I know she lived close, but again, parents that don't watch their children will learn the consequence of that. If you can't pick your child up from school, at least demand she walk home with a friend or two! That was the main problem! They were eating dinner while their daughter was being killed. Irresponsible parents! Stop being irresponsible! Or don't be shocked when your child gets raped and/or killed by a creepy old virgin dude.I cried a few times through this.

I'll never forget Lindsey, my first Kiss! Sadly, Lindsey committed suicide in 2008. I last saw her 2 weeks prior and she looked tired.

158,ciscokid1970,Imaginative cinematography adaptation of a fantastic book,9,26 April 2010,"I just saw Lovely Bones, and I must say I was impressed. The movie is close adaptation of the book The Lovely Bones by Alice Sebold. This is a good story with excellent acting that has cinematography and special effects that is a feast for they eyes. If you liked What Dreams May Come or Flatliners you will enjoy this movie. This is another example of excellent movie that got shafted at the Oscars, it was not even nominated for cinematography. I do not want to give too much away, but I will comment on some points. Within 1 min of the movie, you find out the main character is dead, so it is not like I am giving away the story. The movie takes some liberties with the story, but they make sense, such as compressing the plot to less calendar time and omitting some side stories that were not critical. Andrew Lesnie's Cinematography and Visual effects were outstanding, presenting this constantly changing afterlife, not quite heavensort of waiting area for heaven. Peter Jackson and Lesnie did an excellent job of surreal cinematography to substitute for the graphic and sadistic rape and killing as written in the book. The book made me cry, and gave me nightmares about things that could happen to my own 2 daughters. I wish they would have put a little more effort on the soundtrack and the movie could have moved a bit faster, but all in all this is the kind of movies worthy of the big screen. This movie will prompt you to warn children never to talk to strangers, much less go with them anywhere. Mark Wahlberg had one of his best dramatic performances in this movie. But Stanley Tucci quietly and creepily stole this movie. Definitely worth renting and watching on a big TV screen. Not recommended for children under 13.",The Lovely Bones

Rogert Ebert called it ""deplorable"" I didn't go to see it when it first came out. Shame on me! The risks Peter Jackson took, a thoroughly established filmmaker, should be applauded. True, it's not going to be everybody's cup of tea but then, what is? I was taken by surprise, a film of unbearable emotional suspense breaking every imaginable rule. We're far too used to have stories in which everything is neatly tied up by the end, so we can go back home with a fictitious peace of mind. In ""The Lovely Bones"" we know who the monster is from the time the monstrosity is committed but we're only spectators unable to do anything about it and that frustration may have turn part of the audience and most of the critics away. True the CGI of the ""in between"" is, sometimes, too much but the film as a whole is a real experience. Saorise Ronan is marvelous, so are Rachel Weitz and Mark Whalberg. Stanley Tucci was deservedly nominated for an Oscar and Susan Sarandon, another risk taker, plays the emotional constipated grandmother with great courage. Look at the exhaustion on her face as she takes care of the family, drained without betraying the arid nature of the character. As the film ended I stayed in silence for the longest time, embedded in the sadness, clinging to the hope and mystified by the massacre the critics perpetrated in this original and highly recommendable film",The Lovely Bones
160,rmarkd,"Beautiful, if a bit unfocused",7,20 June 2020,"The Lovely Bones is a movie about a 14 year old girl Susie Salmon (Saoirse Ronan) who was kidnapped and killed by George Harvey (Stanley Tucci). Susie looks down from heaven at her family/killer/almost-boyfriend as the subsequent events unfold. She also serves as movie narrator and resident of the in-between -- a place before heaven. In this in-between place, she meets a girl, Molly.The movie is part Susie and Molly in this place with Susie not quite wanting to cross over, her dad obsessing over catching the killer, her mom wanting to move on, her sister trying to find the killer, her almost-boyfriend befriending a girl who can kinda see the dead, and, for fun, a comic-relief grandmother. Therein lies my biggest issue with the movie -- there are too many things going on and they don't quite fit. The almost-boyfriend/friend-girl doesn't really go anywhere and seems to only serve one purpose at the end. The scenes with the grandmother, while fairly funny, are just out of place. We know early on who killed Susie and that story line is more about whether he will get caught. The dad/sister end up realizing George is the killer due to a ""touch of Susie"" through heaven. Or something like that.Those wanting a supernatural how-will-he-be-caught will be disappointed. It's not that type of movie. It ultimately seems to be a movie about how everyone deals with the grief of Susie's death, including Susie. Much of the movie is spent in the in-between, which is a dream-like world likely devised primarily by Susie but also has touches of George's other victims (the rainbow ball, for example). It's visually beautiful, but disjointed. The how-will-he-be-caught parallel-plot is interesting and a bit exciting near the end, but, upon hindsight, is a bit unfinished.Tragically, Susie's body is never found, and is left in a safe and dropped in a sinkhole that gets covered up. It's not a happy ending movie, but a movie about a 14 year old girl getting killed is already tragic. George does get his comeuppance of sorts. I wish they had done a bit of his ""in-between"" or his straight trip to hell.I think those who like this movie will find reasons to like it, and those who didn't like it will find reasons to not like it. Having read from both sides, it doesn't change my opinion much that this is a beautiful, if a bit messy of a movie.Two things, however, stand out as pretty universally good. Saoirse Ronan is *perfectly* cast is a very innocent looking young girl, who looks 14 and 6 at the same time, which makes her death all the more tragic (and for me, ever so much so given my daughter is currently around that age). And Stanley Tucci is absolutely perfect in his role as the creepy, calculating, and evil George Harvey.7/10. I wanted to give this an 8 or 9, but just too many things going on that took away from things (could have easily cut about 30 minutes from the movie), and the real and in-between world felt more like two different movies.",The Lovely Bones
161,CihanVercan,"Good girls go to Heaven, Bad girls go to Heaven, Dead girls go to Heaven... Sorry pal, NO BOYS ALLOWED!",5,10 January 2010,"A butcher is good at slicing meats, you can consider him very handy; but if you want him to do knitting, he would most likely drop the knit-needle every time. Like being a butcher, Peter Jackson is an expert on Adventure, Horror and Fantasy genres. This time his expertness on Fantasy leads him to have a fantasy of directing a family/drama. In fact he once succeeded in this genre, in 1994's Heavenly Creatures, which have become a cult with both its faults and excellences. Sadly, herein The Lovely Bones he only replicates his faults.The Lovely Bones isn't actually hard to predict the concept when you first see the trailer. It's promised to be a very touching story adapted from a novel, with the fascinating essence of 1970s'. So, it should be a drama about the 1970s' uncorrupted social culture. The problem is you just predict it, but it just doesn't happen. A dead girl starts the narration, her endless narration lasts for 2 hours till the closing credits. Besides either her acting and voice-overs are not even as half good as Dakota Fanning. If this story hasn't been narrated over it could have been another ""Pan's Labyrinth"", yet what it turns out to be is another wasted potential of last year(2009).Just look at this actors for a moment and think: Susan Sarandon, Rachel Weisz, Mark Wahlberg... They are well known with their free-spirit acting characters. Most of the time those 3 don't follow the script at all. You should be a very communicative director, or need a team of good script-supervisors and more co-producers to create a family mood, for it's not easy to balance a harmony between those chosen 3. Director Jackson ultimately fails at this point. Rachel Weisz as the wife, Mark Wahlberg as the husband, Susan Sarandon as the grandma cannot hold onto each other; thus every dialogue of them becomes loose.Looking to other director qualities Jackson is only good at a few points: +++ Pairing off the screenplay components together, ++ Camera language(angles,positioning,directing of photography) sets the correct mood, + Choosing the right special effects with the most suitable sounds, putting over to the most effective lighting plot.Those qualities may take a step forward in a horror, or especially in a sci-fi. But when you're directing a drama, the ultimate goal must be fit: Story-telling. Even though the plot is simple, it's enriched with a bunch of sub-plots, and so sub-genres. That's very disappointing but, each one of those sub-plots are failures on their own: Action sequences are terribly shot and worse cut. The psychopathic killer cannot run faster than a girl who has just fell down from the roof of a double-storied house!(Oh come on! Is this Superman's daughter?) There are many references to very well-known movies such as the kissing scene incarnating into someone else's body for a farewell kiss from Patrick Swayze&Demi Moore's Ghost(1990), the exact same angle of shooting the naked cornfields from Gladiator(2000). Additionally, there are pathetic clichés taken from 80s' teen-Horror(not teen-slasher, exactly teen-Horror) films. Look for sociocultural stereotypes from 1970s', in which the story is happening,... There's none! If you wear thick-framed Clark Kent reading glasses and read Albert Camus books with the low light of your grandma shaded lamps in the middle of the night; would that be enough to represent 1970s'? Look at the big picture: It's the year 1973, it's understandable that your 14-year-old daughter doesn't know to dial 9-1-1 when an emergency occurs when your son hurts himself at the backyard of your house while you and your spouse at work; then instead of calling help from neighbours that 14-year-old girl drives your car to come and find you at work, and let you know that there's an emergency! In 1970s' there must be good neighbourhood connections. No one is aware that they have a serial killer neighbour living in the same neighbourhood for many years. Not only that every crime/thriller scene is another failure on its own, as well. A detective becomes a very good friend of his client, after 1 year of collecting no evidence to search for his murdered daughter; especially when it's clear that the murderer lives in the same neighbourhood. As I said, don't think the plot is bad; it's the sub-plots what really makes the whole film a complete nonsense.Best of the best is the way we're introduced the after-life, then the Heaven. In after-life there are two girls, in Heaven there are even more girls. The first visions from the look of the after-life includes references from Freddy Krueger's Elm Street, as if the death is just a dream. This after-life becomes even more dreamy, when it starts cross-referencing to Across the Universe(2007), using the mood of Alice in Wonderland once again. Hollywood is bored of this theme more than anything, it became like Alice in every-land.Mainly this film was not for somebody like me, a man at age of 27, a man who likes old Peter Jackson films, a man who looks for a good concept and an interesting story in a movie whether it's slow or not. Even the childish vision to spirituality and extreme use of CGI is bearable than the plot. What should be a best time or occasion to watch it? If a friend of one of your kids got killed or something, you might watch this with your daughter. Not a son, a daughter! It's a movie, in which girls rule the Heaven with allowing no boys in there, as if it's been their playground.",The Lovely Bones
162,rawiri42,Different and beautifully portrayed,7,18 April 2014,"How do you follow something as successful as The Lord of the Rings trilogy and King Kong? Well, my ex-neighbour, Sir Peter Jackson has done it beautifully with his wife, Fran Walsh's story in The Lovely Bones. Their joint talent knows no bounds!Saoirse Ronan is exactly right for the role of Susie with her wispy, delicate features and personality. Why she wasn't, at least, nominated for an Oscar, I don't know. Is is just that 15-year-olds don't get nominated for leading actress awards in Hollywood? Her ethereal character was spellbinding.I suppose it wouldn't be Peter Jackson if George Harvey (Stanley Tucci) has simply been caught by either the cops or Susie's dad (Mark Wahlberg) although I must admit I was a bit disappointed that he met such an ""easy"" end. I wanted to see him suffer!Anyway, this is one of those movies you can watch again and again and see different nuances every time. Very surreal and well worth the time. I would love to see a Jackson-directed movie of the life of King David of The Bible. It has all the aspects that make great movies - little guy beating giant, brotherly love between David and Jonathan, some great sex scenes with Bathsheba, plenty of battle scenes and family treachery on all sides.",The Lovely Bones

164,Monotreme02,Biggest disappointment of the year: a big mess,4,17 January 2010,"It really is quite a big mess of a movie: some of it is just imbalanced, but some of it is just plain bad. Not one element of the film is consistently good in any way. Its flaws start on the most basic of levels: the storytelling one. I had not read the novel this film is based on, but I had heard the praise it received, and when I heard the premise, it immediately piqued my interest: The basic idea of a girl helping her family com to terms with her untimely and sudden murder from the afterlife sounded to me like an exceptionally interesting subject to deal with, and what could have proved to be a very unique and imaginative take on the depiction of a family coping with indescribably tragic grief. Indeed, the scenes in the film that deal with the family's reaction to Susie's murder provide the briefest moments of genuine emotion in the film; other than them, the movie never seems to find any emotional consistency. It will go from long and indulgent depictions of Susie wandering around her personalized heaven and meeting other figures in this afterlife that help guide her along the way, to police procedural scenes that portray the detective's investigation of the case, to a comic interlude in which Susie's eccentric and outgoing grandmother takes control over the household while everyone else is falling apart, to suddenly becoming a thriller as Susie's sister decides she will break into Susie's murderer's house in order to collect evidence against him, to a really bizarre scene in which Susie seems to possess the body of another girl in order to bid one last goodbye to the boy she loved. The movie is sprinkled with other strange scenes that lack any coherency or explanation in the context of the film, such as one scene in which Susie goes through a laundry list of her killer's past victims for no apparent reason, or another brief but totally unexplainable moment in which Susie's young brother explains to his grandmother that ""Susie is in the in-between"": in the mythology of the movie this is true, but how the little brother knows this information is entirely beyond me. Without going into too much detail so as not to spoil it, we are shown a scene tacked on at the end of the film of one of the characters meeting his demise, that it just seems so pointless that I just have no idea why it was included. All of these scenes seem so out of place that the movie as a whole consequently ends up feeling completely cold and emotionally detached: save for a few fleeting moments, nothing at all in the film feels in any way genuine.This was one of my most anticipated movies of the year. Everything looked like it was lining up to be something truly special: Peter Jackson returning to his Heavenly Creatures roots and telling a domestic and real-world-based story injected with a fantasy element but, for the first part in more than a decade, not actually existing exclusively in a fantasy world. A story based on a critically acclaimed novel. An all-star cast of genuinely talented individuals. What we ended up getting, though, is nothing less than the biggest disappointment of the year. I combed it from beginning to end and honestly, the film has very few redeeming qualities at all: the two aforementioned performances remain its strongest point, while the rest of it just turns out to be a big, self-indulgent, emotionally detached, inconsistent and incoherent mess. Jackson made so many bad choices as early as the conception stage that I still can't believe this is the same director that brought us the Lord of the Rings trilogy, so fine-tuned, so perfect, every element flawlessly lined up. This film never seems to know what story it wants to tell: is it a murder mystery? Is it a family drama? Is it a romance-from-beyond-the-grave? I certainly don't know, and it doesn't seem like Jackson does either. Even the writing is stiff: many sequences are accompanied by very overt voice-overs by Susie, which are clearly and obviously lifted directly from the first-person narration of the novel (again, I haven't read the book, but I know it is written in first person, so I assume these passages are lifted directly from its pages) and while the first-person stream of consciousness style works well in a novel, in the film, it just comes across as flaccid, sloppy writing as Robert McKee so eloquently put it in Adaptation. The lame performances. The digital shots. The bad CGI. The overall lack of any heart or passion. I really wanted to like this film, but the more and more I think about it, the more I realize that there really isn't much to like about it at all. And the fact that it's such a missed opportunity and that I anticipated it so much makes it all the worse.",The Lovely Bones
165,blairgallop7,Not quite lovely but makes the grade,7,6 January 2010,"I haven't watched a movie for a while that is as captivating as The Lovely Bones. The film revolves around how the Salmon family deal with the loss of their relative Susie(Saoirse Ronan-Atonement), a 14 year old girl who is murdered. Mark Wahlberg,Rachel Weisz,Susan Sarandon,Michael Imperioli and Stanley Tucci co-star. Though Mark Wahlberg and Michael Imperioli's roles in this film are above-average, Susan Sarandon and Rachel Weisz's could have been better. But the roles that I thought stole the show were Saoirse Ronan's and Stanley Tucci's especially because I predict an Oscar nomination for Stanley Tucci who plays the creepy neighbour George Harvey to perfection. At times, this film doesn't feel like a Peter Jackson film but at times it does. Overall, an above-average drama-thriller with a fantasy-like plot.",The Lovely Bones
166,bennyhagen,Lovely. But what is it?,6,28 March 2010,"Well... this is basically a very well made movie. If I'd take each scenes by itself, it's great and some of them are simply gorgeous and also the masterful CGI is well integrated into the plot. The acting is decent, the cinematography is good, everything looks beautiful, I think the fact that Peter Jackson knows about movie making is beyond argument.Now the problem appears as putting all those things together. Just take one scene from ""heaven"", put next to it Susan Sarandons ""houseworking"" montage, then the scene where Whalberg gets beaten up by the football player, then the dead girl floating in the swamp and then Suzies ghost(?) kissing that boy... you probably get where I'm coming from. It's a confusing patchwork of... things. What is it supposed to be? A comedy? A family film? A drama? A fantasy movie? A mystery? The thing is it could have been any of those, but trying to be everything is a bit more then this movie can chew. The genres in the mix even seem to hinder each other, as for example it could have been a decent mystery movie, with some comedy elements (which I actually expected it to be) if it wouldn't try to be so family friendly too, so it needs too cut down on tension and violence A LOT. So at this point, what it could be regarded as is an art movie, but for that it certainly is not crossing any of those lines. Now what it is, it is a book. Books can contain a lot of elements and be good due to this certain complexity, but the same concept in movies can be a problem. Though not having read the original, I just go ahead and guess that this certain book probably wasn't really suitable for adaptation, but at least it might be a good subject for a debate on the recently very popular theme of book adaptations.So, all together, well made movie, but doesn't really work.

169,the-gossip-king,A misfire...,2,18 January 2010,"Peter Jackson was sadly the wrong person to direct this film. He is a director who works good against a broad setting yet fails in bringing the heartbreaking realism needed to make this film have what it lacks - authenticity. The film is a multi layered and a large problem is that many of the levels that need to work in order for the film to be a success - don't. Part of the problem stressed by many are the overlong and overwrought heaven scenes. Jackson seems to desperately be trying to imitate Terry Gilliam in a film that doesn't need that visual quality. I'm not sure whether he is incapable of having a film without experimenting with visual effects but this left me repulsed. The next problem is linked to the first. Because we spend so much time in this CGI heaven we miss out a lot of the best thing about the film which are the quiet moments where the family deal with their grief. Because the heaven scenes get in the way whenever we return it feel like something happened that the audience missed which gives that part of the story a jolted feel. Another is Mark Wahlberg who is a good actor but he is not good enough to handle a role of such emotional depth like this. The next is Stanley Tucci. Tucci is a brilliant actor and is genuinely creepy. He gives the best performance but because of the weakness of the script it seems more like a character study than a real character. Because it does feel like a character study it feels awkwardly mixed in with the rest of the film like it doesn't belong there. One other things is the wretched music score. I beg of Peter Jackson to stick with Howard Shore! If there are strengths then they would be this. Rachel Weisz is good an unlike other people I did sympathize with her character. Susan Sarandon is decent and so is the cinematography, that's it!",The Lovely Bones
170,I_Love_Spielberg,"Peter Jackson's ""Lovely"" version",10,16 January 2010,"""The Lovely Bones"" is a Peter Jackson film based on Alice Sebold's novel about a 14-year-old girl named Susie Salmon who is raped and murdered. She is sent into the ""In-Between"" to watch her family cope with the loss and her murderer continue to live his disgusting life. When I first heard that Peter Jackson was going to take on this project, I was very excited. I have not read the book, but I was anxious nonetheless, and knowing Jackson's wide filmography, I was aware that this was going to be something worthwhile. So, I waited, and waited, and waited. I heard stories about creative clashes between Jackson and the visual effects department as to the portrayal of heaven. I had fears that it might not get made. It would be a dead project. But my hopes were raised once more when they started filming and it was in post-production, and then the release date was announced. Patiently, but oh so patiently, I waited. Upon my wait, I had heard mostly negative things about it, which did not shock me when I heard the complaint on the director. However, still wanting to have my own opinion on the matter, I went to the theater to see it. I was not disappointed by this film. Jackson, like he did with ""Heavenly Creatures"" and ""Lord of the Rings,"" creates a perfect balance between story-telling and the visual effects, although some of the visual effects were cartoonish; that does not mean that they did not fit well with the subject matter (they did). I could tell that this was a story that Peter Jackson wanted to tell, and he does it with great conviction and passion. Saorsie Ronan, who is known widely for her role in Joe Wright's ""Atonement,"" does a fabulous job with the lead role of Susie Salmon. It can be viewed as emotionless, but what I loved about it was that it was perfect, because the truth is: how do you feel about something like this? You have been raped, murdered, and you are only 14 years old. So much happens. How do you react? And Ronan answers that beautifully. The rest of the cast, Mark Wahlberg, Rachel Weisz, Susan Sarandon, and Stanley Tucci, were excellent as well. Mark Wahlberg and Rachel Weisz, both parents in real life even though they do not have children together, brought tears to my eyes. Their portrayal of parents going through the kind of loss that Jack and Abigail Salmon go through is real, it is honest. And Susan Sarandon's part as Grandma Lynn was spot-on. My sister viewed the character as a rude character. Which she is, but she is handling the loss in her own way. And Stanley Tucci, who plays George Harvey (the pederast), does a superb job at making you despise Harvey, and making him so disgusting and creepy. What you see in the film is actually what happens in real life. You are seeing pederasty in its true and awful form. Now, be warned, this is not a film for everyone. There are transitions that people will not be comfortable with, but everyone is different in what they like. It did take a while for me to become adjusted with it. But after that, I was fine. So please, see it if you get the chance. Or if it is not worth spending the money to see it in theaters, rent it when it comes out on DVD. It is worth every second. Also, if you are aware of Peter Jackson making cameos in his movies, look for him. He is not that hard to spot.",The Lovely Bones
171,hung_fao_tweeze,Not bad - but I wanted this to be better than it was,6,20 August 2010,"Truly, this is a really good story that seems to have gotten bloated by special effects (which were really good) and in-your-face-and-sometimes-beats-you-over-the-head attempts at sentimentality. It's about a girl (played by the very lovely and talented Saoirse Ronan) who is murdered by some kind of serial killer, her life in some kind of limbo between life and death, and her family's attempts to find her or the murderer. I was surprised to find that Peter Jackson had a hand in this yet it also begins to reveal the weaknesses in Jackson's modus-operandi that I've always noticed while others missed because the movies were weighed down by heavy plot and special effects. There is a tendency to dwell longer on scenes than necessary - especially the sentimental. For myself, if the scene fails to evoke the tears - move on! This film does not do that and I found myself becoming restless and annoyed. Other story lines tended to do the same thing to the point where I found myself begging for something to happen - even something predictable - just to get the story moving. This is a film that should have been enjoyed and there really is quite a bit to like. Saoirse Ronan is the best thing about the film and I expect great performances from her in the future. However, like the ultimate disappointing fate of the murderer this film does the metaphorical same with its own fate. In fact, the best analogy of this film is to apply to it what it tried to convey - it lingers in limbo between an honest-to-goodness murder mystery and an other-worldly fantasy with a bit of an unrequited love story thrown in without ever truly being any of them. Bottomline: Not a bad film but not the great film it could have been. Most people will find something to like. Some will walk away a little disoriented and feeling like they may have missed something - like satisfaction. Great special effects! Once again - Saoirse Ronan is the one redeeming feature and when she isn't on the screen the film suffers. A potentially good story eroded by things already mentioned previously.",The Lovely Bones

173,de_niro_2001,I thought it was good,8,8 July 2010,"If this had not been a Peter Jackson film I doubt if I would have gone and seen it. The reviews it has received range from mixed to negative. I don't think it's as good as The Lord of the Rings or King Kong but still a film worth seeing. The fact that the protagonist is a teenage girl would put many guys off seeing it but Peter Jackson has made some good films for boys of all ages and I definitely am a fan of his work. There is a small in-joke with the bookshop advertising the book of The Lord of the Rings and you see Peter Jackson in the camera shop examining a now long obsolete implement, a cine camera. It also seems strange now in the digital age Susie taking her pictures on film. I must admit when I first saw it I didn't recognise Saoirse Ronan from Atonement. She gives a good performance but the best performance in the film is from Stanley Tucci. Right from the moment he appears on screen you're thinking ""I don't like the look of this guy"". He was nominated for an Oscar but didn't win. He should have. The book is I think more of a ladies' book and I haven't read it so I can't make any comparisons. One thing I know about the book is that Christian fundamentalists didn't like it because there is no last judgement and no God in the afterlife as portrayed in the book. But what's so bad about there being no last judgement. They turn God into a bogeyman and they are very flawed and bad people if they wish an eternity of torment on people who don't share their obsession with ancient Middle Eastern beliefs. One critic said Peter Jackson portrayed the afterlife as an amalgam of screensavers. Personally, I don't want my afterlife to be as girly as Susie's.",The Lovely Bones
174,Sjhm,Simply a bad adaptation,3,27 May 2012,"I wanted to like this, and believe me I tried very hard. But it was simply a bad film. The writers tore the guts out of the book, and one of the main problems burdening the movie is that there is not enough left to make a complete film. An obvious failing is the deeply unsatisfactory ending, Susie's killer essentially gets away with it. Story threads are started and abruptly cut off, and the film never really develops any of the characters that fully. Susie carries the story almost on her own. Whilst Miss Ronan is undeniably talented, and gives Susie that tenderness, innocence and vulnerability essential to the character, the writing doesn't give her that much to work with. This is certainly true of Mark Wahlberg and Rachel Weisz, their parts are woefully inadequate, Mark Wahlberg does a fine job in as far as his part allows. Miss Weisz is less fortunate in that writing for her part is even thinner, and somehow it feels a stretch to see her as the mother of three, and one of them a teenager. Susan Sarandon's role in this film makes no sense, she is completed wasted. A shame. This could have been so much better.",The Lovely Bones
175,benprichardsdotcom,Positive review from someone who hasn't read the source material.,8,8 January 2021,"I remember watching this at the time in the cinema and being completely bowled over emotionally by it, so much so that I had forgotten The Lovely Bones was why I love Song to the Siren and Big Ships (both songs on the soundtrack). In a way I would love to un-see this so I could read the book beforehand; same for Gone Girl and Cloud Atlas but hey-ho. Speaking of adaptations, I am one of those who really doesn't like the Peter Jackson hatchet job which is his LOTR trilogy (despite thinking the first film was really good), so I can really empathise with those who love the written version of The Lovely Bones and loathe the screen version.Saoirse Ronan is incredible in this, as she is in anything she does but I had forgotten just what a stellar cast she had alongside her. Susan Sarandon and Stanley Tucci being particularly good as supporting cast. I think Peter Jackson does a really good job and his experimentation with macro and sound works well. The scene where Rose McIver is in Tucci's house is incredibly tense.All in all, to say this is now 11 or 12 years old it has aged well, albeit the CGI isn't that great - which was one of my reasons for disliking the screen version of LOTR. There is enough pathos and live action to easily overcome the shoddy special effects, the soundtrack (by Brian Eno) is very, very good and the acting is gripping.",The Lovely Bones
176,DunkelheitVZ,This movie is made for whom exactly?,3,9 February 2012,"Surely not for teenagers and younger, since the whole killer scenes are quite disturbing. Is it a thriller? The Disney like fluffy after death scenes speak against it, when teenagers in plateau shoes dance on records. Is it a whodunnit? Not really since you see the killer early (why they hide him in the first 2 minutes is beyond me). And how they ever even suspect the guy near the end is very beyond me, too. It is completely out of the blue and for no reason. So did they try to make a movie that was never seen before? Well, some scenes were way too cliché for that. Does the development of characters or story suck you in? Well, again I have to respectfully negate this question. No character seems to develop, at least not in a reasonable way. Why does the father suddenly suspect the guy, why is he ready to let go, why does the mother come back suddenly? Is it a movie about love? Maybe just maybe, the beyond abysmal kissing scene near the end when the dead girl seems to take over the weird girl could be a hint, but quite frankly, it better not!Tell us, for whom was this movie done? I have no clue and the director did not care either. And this is the big problem of the movie. It is a big pool of nothingness. And boring on top.",The Lovely Bones
177,GethinVanH,Bad writing meets some very good acting,5,10 January 2010,"When someone dies in a movie why is it the police never question the creepy middle-aged man who lives alone and builds doll house furniture? This question is never asked in the Lovely Bones and for most of the movie I put logical questions like this aside because the acting is actually quite good.Everyone is very good in all their roles. Sarandon is pitch perfect as the domineering grandmother. Mark Wahlberg was actually very good in a role in which he didn't play a complete airhead. The young actress Ronan who plays Susie is also quite good in this role. The movie would have been really wretched if she wasn't able to do anything with this role. She pretty much accomplishes as much as she can given the script.The visual effects are pretty good and even though they were pretty much used sparingly, I thought they were over-used. There's a lot of symbolism as well, almost too much at times.Tucci wasn't exactly bad as the murderer either but there wasn't really a lot for him to work with here. He essentially plays a one-dimensional serial killer, complete with his secret scrapbook of misdeeds. His fate was supposedly sealed when a few test audiences thought his character should be killed off in the end. I think Jackson tried to humanize him to a degree but ultimately failed. He shouldn't trust test audiences, they're notoriously bad judges of good movie-making.",The Lovely Bones

Why when filming a 'MOVIE' that deals heavily with the afterlife, did they need to use CGI in the first place? Right?
All Peter Jackson needed to do was put a camera on the actors, kill them, and then just film it. That isn't to hard, right?
Then all these fault-finding, judgmental, negative, unfavorable, unsympathetic; overly critical, self-absorbed, self-obsessed, self-seeking, reviewers would be so overjoyed and pleased, that they would be forced to write a positive review. Right?",The Lovely Bones
179,Red_Flag,A lovely little misstep!,5,21 February 2010,"Peter Jackson is an enormous talent, be it art-house (Heavenly Creatures) or splatter house (The Frighteners) his position as one of the most ingenious artists of our time is set in stone thanks to a little film called Lord of the Rings. The Lovely Bones is a compilation of his previous work, the subtly of Heavenly Creatures combined with the scope of his more epic creations. Is the final product a lovely little masterpiece or is a lovely little misstep?Lifted, almost directly, from the classic Alice Sebold novel The Lovely Bones which deals with the kidnapping, rape and eventual murder of a 14 year old girl played by the ever wonderful Saoirse Ronan. Based on the critically acclaimed best-selling novel by Alice Sebold, and directed by Oscar winner Peter Jackson from a screenplay by Jackson & Fran Walsh & Philippa Boyens, The Lovely Bones centres on a young girl who has been murdered and watches over her family – and her killer – from heaven. She must weigh her desire for vengeance against her desire for her family to heal. Oscar nominee Mark Wahlberg and Oscar winners Rachel Weisz and Susan Sarandon star along with Stanley Tucci, Michael Imperioli and Oscar nominee Saoirse RonanGreat effort has gone into adapting Sebold's story to the big screen and it plays out wonderfully. The story is emotional, tense and for the most part extremely beautiful; all of which is squandered by the incredibly off-putting comic relief that was mostly absent from the novel. It's incredibly inappropriate and off-putting and has no place in a film so brutal. Susan Sarandon is the main offender playing the bumbling alcoholic grandmother. Her role as a whole seems redundant other than to deliver an inappropriate one liner! For the majority of the film her character will have you rolling your eyes, gritting your teeth and pulling you hair out...sit down grandma you're not funny!Jacksons direction is formulaic, but always competent. Painted by numbers seems the appropriate term to use in this case. One moment its brooding, tense and compelling but on several very noticeable occasions Jacksons slips up producing something that can only be described as painfully armature. No matter how confident you get as a director montages in place of organic flow is never acceptable and at several pivotal moments the film slips up big times. Not to say everything is bad as far as the direction goes - Jackson does a astounding job at building up tension within the first twenty minutes almost to the point where it's hard to watch, granted all this tension is deflated with the final, tepid scene of the movie but stokes of geniuses often shine through a otherwise plain canvas.The acting is very hit and miss, as I talked about before Susan Sarandon is the standout disappointment of the whole picture and as talented as she is her presence is detested throughout the entire thing. Other noticeable downfalls come in the form of Mark Wahlberg who, is very talented, but seems to sleepwalk through this entire film - his character is very two dimensional and for me blame is to be shared with both him and the writing of his character. Standout performances include Rachel Weisz who is inexplicably missing in action throughout most of the film but they give her a lot of depth for what little screen time she has. The true masterful performance; and one of the few redeeming qualities of the film is this young girl Saoirse Ronan who is just as incredible here as she was in the 2007 adaptation of ""Atonement"". She brings believability and grace to what has turned out to be an extremely ugly film to sit through.The imagery kills the fear. In a film which is essentially about a child serial killer, the constant blossoming of visual possibility leaves the reality of what happened to Susie both hidden and cold. As far as the presentation goes the film is a mess; strange that such an ugly film should come from a visual master like Jackson but calling the visuals in this films abysmal is a gross understatement. When our main character Susie is in limbo she sees what she perceives as a perfect world...we, the audience, see a crude child watercolour or a desktop screensaver. It shouldn't be as imposing as it is, for a film that needs to rely on its subtly to work these grand opuses of colour and grandeur are totally out of place and unattractive . We've seen the afterlife treated much better using practical effects so to have it done here entirely visually feels heartless and cold. No bones about it, Jackson looks like he's spent so long in front of a computer he's forgotten how to tell a story.On the plus side the films soundtrack is magnificent scoring high on both emotional resonance and striking fear. Well known orchestral and world tracks like ""This Mortal Coil - Song To The Siren"" and ""Cocteau Twins- Alice"" punctuate the distracting visuals and provide moments of real beauty, it's a shame the overall visual package couldn't have lived up to that of the soundtrack.Verdict: It's unfortunate that a film this close to Jacksons heart should come out so muddled and chaotic. It reeks of an unfinished product with sloppy B grade visuals alongside Jacksons often amateurish direction. Moments of beauty often punctuate the clutter thanks to standout performances by Saoirse Ronan and a soundtrack that is a treat for the ears; but when a director this competent gives us a product this undercooked its hard not to scoff. You can't help but asked ""what happened?"" a story this promising, a director this talented...clearly something is rotten in Denmark. The lovely bones can be precious at times but for better or for worse this is one murder mystery that belongs in the ground.",The Lovely Bones

182,mary-179-677383,Seqemented and Slow,1,6 October 2011,"The movie sounded interesting, so I decided to give it a go.Firstly, the movie is very slow paced and boring to watch.The movie is adapted from a book, I think they assume all movie watches have also read the book as there are huge gaps everywhere.The main character, you never really see a straight forward way that she died, its very fragmented. It's easy to put together, but really it just seems lazy to fragment the murder as the writers didn't have to explain how he got away with anything.Also, the murderer, you find out who he straight away. His interviewed by police and he states ""i was at home"" the police don't even look into him or even his past background.The events in the movie are brushed past by and you don't really connect with any of the characters properly. The parents of the murdered child communicate maybe three lines to each other. Then movie seems to chop scenes up but not communicate the full story very well.The end of the movie is very choppy.. loose ends everywhere. Again easy to put it together yourself, but just makes the movie seem half made.",The Lovely Bones
183,MetalAngel,The most disappointing film of 2009. Saaaaaad...,2,15 February 2010,"There are a few directors who've created masterpieces for the world to watch over and over again; important films which become a part of our modern culture and define an era. Peter Jackson is one such director with his immortal ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy, and his other impressive films such as the visually stunning ""King Kong"" remake or the subtle drama ""Heavenly Creatures""...but each and every one of these directors also has a movie flop which drives us to question their talent and makes us say aloud ""What was he thinking?!"". His newest flick ""The Lovely Bones"" is one such example of a bad film made by a good director.Based on Alice Sebold's best-seller, ""The Lovely Bones"" tells the story of fourteen year old Susie Salmon (Saoirse Ronan), a happy teenager who lives the perfect life with her flawless family and seems to have everything going for her...until she's targeted by a deranged killer who lives in the neighborhood. He murders her, and she passes on to a magical world between heaven and hell where she's supposed to find her way to 'the other side', but she remains there witnessing her family's downfall into sadness, depression and vengeance. Her father (Mark Wahlberg) struggles ceaselessly to discover her murderer and take his vengeance on him, her mother (Rachel Weisz) becomes distant trying to cope with the pain and loss, and her grandmother (Susan Sarandon) tries to remain cheerful so as to help the family deal with the traumatic situation. And Susie herself must choose between letting go and reaching heaven or harbouring her vengeful thoughts towards her killer and remaining lost in limbo.This has all the makings of a powerful and moving film, and the novel is just as much. It contains deep and disturbing passages that move the reader from page to page, feeling and tasting the heart-break and the fear with each word. Now, I know a film can NEVER be just like the book because a director will always take his or her vision of a story and transform it into his or her own, but what Peter Jackson has done with this remarkable poignant novel cannot be pardoned; he has stripped it from its beauty and power, removed every trace of its intelligence and charm and given us a raw, disorganized and fairly boring carcass of what once was a story.The acting is horrible! With the exception of a fairly good performance by Saoirse Ronan and a truly creepy and disturbing portrayal of the killer (played by Stanley Tucci), the rest of the actors destroy the characters they're playing. Wahlberg literally makes us NOT care about the pained and vengeful father he's playing, Rachel Weisz (who is usually one of the best actresses in any film she's a part of) screams a lack of motivation and fails to transmit any feeling whatsoever, and Susan Sarandon makes you want to turn away from the screen with her lack of a personality. The other actors are either walking clichés or terrible, and that's where the film begins to crumble.The score is all wrong, and the soundtrack breaks from deeply melancholic, to upbeat songs and happy tunes, to triumphant melodies and to heart-breaking pianos to a point where we're not sure what to follow. The movie has been edited in a way that should black-list the editor: a scene stars to make us feel sad for the characters, with the faintest hint of emotion, only to be immediately cut into a joyous and 'funny' scene where the characters are as happy as can be, and before our minds have made the shift we see another scene where sadness and pain abounds again. The scenes never last long enough either, and they break off so abruptly to pick up on a forgotten storyline that we never really come to care about what's happening.Much of the raw emotion was cut so the film could achieve a family-friendly PG-13 rating, I hear. Much of the novel's disturbing emotional content was deleted to be replaced with unimportant scenes and a script that runs on autopilot. Like other critics have commented so far, it seems like Peter Jackson took a nice story, took from it a couple of things he liked, added a whole lot of visual effects and ended up pasting it up in a senseless collage that's not even half as impressive as it should be. And not even the visual effects, for which he's famous, are as astounding as they've been before. I mean, this is the man who wowed us with jaw-dropping, revolutionary special effects in ""The Lord of the Rings"" and ""King Kong"", and now he comes up with a standard...THING that amazes no one. What is THAT all about? There are three things which save this movie from being utter garbage. Some images and settings from Susie's fantasy world are quite charming, and some dream sequences do dazzle us and inspire our imaginations. There's also Stanley Tucci's performance, which literally makes shivers run down our spines. And there's a particular scene near the end of the movie where Susie's sister breaks into the killer's home, which is the ONLY scene in the entire movie that freezes us with tension and rivets us to our seats. Anything other than these three things is, by all means, disposable.I don't know what Peter Jackson's point was, but he got everything wrong. Of course, it's not like this is THE worst film of the year...but it tries very hard to be. I recommend it for Jackson fans or for those of you curious to see what everyone's talking about so much, but otherwise, steer clear from it. It's unimpressive, silly, confusing, and a tad boring. But at least Peter Jackson didn't completely waste this year, since he also produced the amazing ""District 9"", one of the best films of the year.Rating: 1 star out of 4.",The Lovely Bones
184,Zlatikevichius,Great one,9,26 January 2021,"This should be movie about the slow disintegration of a family following an unimaginable tragedy that turned into colorful movie about the path of a pure soul that search the answer about the real time when should give up and go forward... And everyone around didn't liked it because of wrong interpretation of the novel, and missing the point. Contrary, I liked it because of that. It's enough of the movies about the family, I think. And it's been time to be done a movie like this. Great work of Peter Jackson, I would give him 5 stars about direction, but I think he should concentrate a little bit more on characters. I this movie I think the strongest performance was from the little Rose McIver, and all other characters are lost in the story and in all that mood showed by P. Jackson. That's why I gave 9 stars instead of 10. Maybe Jackson isn't fold about that, and maybe the characters were lost during the post-production and editing, but why then there was not a single nomination in acting categories for any of the actors from The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King? The editing of that movie was awesome, like everything else (it won 11 Oscars). Than, it must be P.J.'s fold of not being preoccupied about characters, in that movie like this one too.

185,wlee08,Desktop Landscapes for Suzy Salmon and Friends,7,3 August 2010,"Some quality computer-enhanced imagery creates the territory known as purgatory which in fact resembles Narnia or some other fantasy dreamland. I know, it sounds really bad. And at times it is a little tedious - as the formerly-alive girls dance around tossing magic leaves at each other. A lot of it is filler. But a lot of it is quite good, in terms of pure visual imagery and symbolism. And it is taking place against a fairly solemn backdrop - the real world tale of catching the neighborhood killer, and a family's painful loss. There are moments when the casual viewer might call into question how much pain is actually being felt - perhaps they were trying for too much with Susan Sarandon in the role of comic relief. My brain can't deal with too many emotions. It's surreal, that's good. It's frightening, that's good. It's suspenseful, good. It's a profound drama, that's good. Its a comedy, what?

187,dfwforeignbuff,Supernatural Fantasy Not Thriller horror or drama. Movie Did not Involve me emotionally,5,10 June 2010,"The Lovely Bones 2009 135 minutes pg13. Peter Jackson has made a lot of great movies. I have not seen the one that they say is his best which is Heavenly Creatures. I did read the bestseller book of this film written by Alice Sebold. PLOT: 14 year old Susie Salmon (Saoirse Ronan) has been murdered by her neighbor George Harvey (Stanley Tucci). From beyond she watches both over her family, as well as her killer. The young girl narrates the story from Heaven while the lives of all the people around her are undergoing changes while they try to get someone to look for her body. She is charged with the decision to seek revenge or to help her family heal after her murder. Her parents and other family members try to handle her loss and also try to track down the killer as he prepares to strike again. Will the killer be allowed to strike again? I had great hopes for this movie as a thriller. In fact the first 1/3 of the film was great. The story centered upon a 14-year-old girl who narrates the story from heaven after having been brutally murdered would make a great film I thought. ""Heavenly Creatures,"" one of his early films involves similar teenagers and murder in an otherwise tranquil setting and it is said it is his best film. The last 2/3 of the movie with the 14 year old girl in heaven as the omniscient narrator just did not work for me. Making the victim a sweet, poetic narrator is disturbing. I thought Saoirse Ronanas Susie Salmon was a very good actor for her young age. The film is more of a fantasy than horror thriller or drama. Caught between death and heaven, Susie watches as her family tries to cope and the killer (Stanley Tucci) goes undetected. It is a pg 13 movie The murder is unseen, the rape barely hinted at. The novel never flinched, the movie does. I am not sure if this film is a new low in the annals of movie adaptations. The fantasy supernatural thriller elements just did not work for me and overall effect was very fake. The screen writers essentially reinvented Sebold's work into something else. Its an OK movie but bored me.",The Lovely Bones
188,Reel_starz,A satisfying if uneven adaptation of a modern classic,8,17 January 2010,"I first read Alice Sebold's novel The Lovely Bones almost a year ago. The book was masterfully written with complex characters and simple yet elegant prose, and Sebold did a wonderful job of integrating the various story-lines as well as depicting the impact Susie's death had on her neighborhood and family. It was clear, however, that a movie adaptation would be tricky, perhaps even impossible, and considering the intricacy and richness of the book, Peter Jackson does as good a job as one can expect.To be sure, The Lovely Bones has a lot going for it: gorgeous cinematography and visuals, a haunting score, a seriously creepy villain and several scenes that effectively combine surreal wonder with genuine suspense and pathos. The cast, for the most part, is good, with solid performances from Rachel Weisz, Rose McIver and Susan Sarandon, but the lovely bones that really hold this movie together are Saoirse Ronan as the main protagonist, Stanley Tucci as her murderer and Mark Wahlberg as the dad whose dedication to his daughter verges on obsession. As Susie, Saoirse Ronan had what is arguably the most challenging part, and she pulls it off admirably. She is mature without being precocious, yet still manages to inject Susie with a lively spirit that reminds the audience that, even after all she has gone through, she is still a kid at heart. That childlike innocence is nicely rivaled by the menace that Stanley Tucci brings to Mr. Harvey, whom he portrays as an authentic creep without turning the character into an over-the-top caricature. In the book, Mr. Harvey was given a background, a story that humanizes him, if you will, but by eliminating this from the movie, Peter Jackson and Stanley Tucci bring to life a character that is all-the-more ominous and disturbing; you could easily imagine that Mr. Harvey is your next-door neighbor or one of the thousands of strangers you pass every day in the mall. In fact, Mr. Harvey is so real that, especially for parents, the movie might be almost unwatchable. Fortunately, not only does Mr. Harvey get his comeuppance in the end, but Mark Wahlberg inhabits his role as Jack Salmon with such sensitivity and emotion that the audience is able to easily connect with the story despite the heavy fantasy and horror elements. Case in point: in the scene where Jack finally confronts Mr. Harvey, the tension between the two men is almost tangible, and though the dialogue is casual enough, Wahlberg conveys an eclectic mix of emotions simply using his eyes. It was a part only a real-life parent could have pulled off, and Wahlberg does so with grace and dignity.Nonetheless, the movie has a number of flaws, the foremost of which is the rather choppy editing. Some of the transitions between scenes feel too abrupt or a tad misplaced, and Jackson relies too heavily on the back-and-forth technique that works effectively in a couple of places, such as the scene where Mr. Harvey shows Susie his handmade 'club house' in the cornfield, but is distracting in others. There is the sense that a lot was cut out, hence the sloppy editing, and the film isn't allowed to breathe as fully as it should have. A few aspects of the plot are dealt with rather clumsily, such as when Abigail (Rachel Weisz's character) leaves her family and returns for little apparent reason and the fact that Jack takes two years to finally figure out that Susie's murderer was the weird guy across the street.Although the film does not share its source material's nuanced finesse, many of Sebold's central themes still resonate. Over the past decade, Peter Jackson turned a beloved, ""unfilmable"" trilogy of books into, arguably, the most phenomenal achievement in recent cinematic history and, only two years later, crafted one of the only successful remakes of any Hollywood classic, making him one of the most ambitious directors alive today. Few other film-makers can make expensive, visual effects-laden, mainstream blockbusters that don't abandon the story, characters and emotions for cheap action set pieces and explosions. Though The Lovely Bones does not reach the epic grandeur of the aforementioned The Lord of the Rings and King Kong, Jackson successfully captures the grotesque tragedy of Susie's death - especially in a particular scene in a bathroom that vividly evokes Jackson's horror roots - as well as the dreamy beauty of her 'perfect' afterlife. He manages to integrate suspense, drama and fantasy wonderfully, creating an enthralling, memorable story about a family that struggles to overcome its grief and ultimately learns to embrace life.The Lovely Bones is, at times, messy, but it's also bold and intriguing. If anyone could have successfully adapted Sebold's novel, it was Jackson, so perhaps such a feat is impossible. Peter Jackson has said that no movie based on a good book can be much more than a pale imitation of its source. Perhaps he's right, and in the end, that's all we really need.",The Lovely Bones
189,bsant54,A waste of time,6,2 March 2020,I don't know what I was expecting but it wasn't this movie.Feel good show about a murdered child. Sugar and spice and also everything not so nice scenery.There you go.,The Lovely Bones
190,matty_mushroom1983,Stanley Tucci is incredible,8,21 November 2015,"Stanley Tucci wanted this role but didn't want to be recognised as a murderous pedophile from it, so he tried to look the least like himself that he could. From this he brought such a disturbingly beautiful personable that I'll never see him as anything else. Mark Wahlberg is Mark Wahlberg, who always does well as every role he's given (that I've seen).Lovely Bones is a punishing view of a time before the western world was worried about how much you could trust your neighbours, and it delivers a situation in which I felt desperate and helpless, crying and begging Susie to ignore this man.For some victims of the abuse of your trust and sexual and liberal rights, Lonely Bones could be very confronting and invoking.

191,Chance_Boudreaux19,Peter Jackson's decline,5,9 February 2021,"Unfortunately, this movie seems to be the one that started the decline of the once inventive and visionary director. Without taking Jackson's documentary work into consideration his last four narrative features were the Lovely Bones and the Hobbit trilogy. That trilogy has fun moments but like this movie it relies too heavily on CGI. Jackson was once a director who liked to do a lot of things practically, especially in his early days but also when he did Lord of the Rings. I know that King Kong also had a lot of CGI but for the most part it looked great and felt necessary. In this movie even a shot of an object falling down a hole looks very fake, not to mention the horrible effects used in the afterlife scenes. Now, I get that it's hard to show an otherworldly setting without using CGI but it certainly could've been done much better and mixed in with more practical settings.Bad effects could certainly be overlooked but they're not the only problem that the Lovely Bones has. The biggest problem is that the story is very interesting but the way it's told is very messy and sappy. This story should've had more grit and should've been aimed more at adults rather than teens as the trivia section implies. There was certainly a lot of room for sentimentality in this story but if it was told better those sentimental moments would've hit way harder. There are some brilliant scenes in this movie but they get bogged down by other mediocre or downright terrible ones. Additionally, the movie meanders a lot and things just seem to happen without a sense of where the movie is headed or what the ultimate goal is.As for performances, Mark Wahlberg feels kind of out of place. This is him straight after the Happening and he seems to still be in the mindset that he had for that role as some of his line deliveries seemed very similar in both movies. His Happening like acting got a few chuckles out of me that the movie didn't intend but I like him as an actor so I'm not complaining that he was in this movie. Most of the cast is good, Saoirse Ronan included even though the dreadful overuse of narration hurts her performance. The real standout however is Stanley Tucci. He fully deserved that Oscar nomination without a doubt. His performance is extremely creepy and he elevates the movie in the scenes that he's in. This is a fine example of a terrific performance wasted in an otherwise mediocre movie. That is just the story of this movie really, a lot of potential wasted. A visionary director tackling a very interesting story should've been a slam dunk but unfortunately it just ended up being frustrating and messy.",The Lovely Bones

194,Jules45,Peter Jackson's most overlooked and compelling drama to date packed with truly captivating performances.,8,19 February 2010,"With Jackson's track record most people would have thought it inevitable for him to mess up some day, and that day certainly wasn't today and hopefully won't be for many days to come. The Lovely Bones is based on Alice Sebold's best selling book and I was surprised whilst watching the film that it seemed to take everything that could be loved about the book (with some bigger and smaller changes) and make it feel like there couldn't have been a more distinguishable yet compulsively essential adaptation.Susie Salmon (our leading lady who is the perfectly portrayed by the fantastic Saoirse Ronan) gets murdered by her neighbour George Harvey and watches over her family in a place known as the Inbetween. Not heaven and not earth but as expected an eyeful of luscious CGI scenery which admittedly doesn't match the glossy world of Pandora from Avatar but feels like a more rewarding experience to rejoice in after her traumatic killing.A sombre and tension filled start which proves hugely moving and it perfectly sets the tone for the rest of the film and lets the cast flourish into much more tainted and affected characters. The drama the cast create proves to be the best motivation of the film and overlooks the search for Susie's killer. Mark Wahlberg and Susan Surandon particularly shine in their roles but Stanley Tucci who deserves to win his Oscar nomination, steals the show with his characters chilling simplicity and foreboding tension created with his appearance on scene.The Lovely Bones proves a compelling drama and the transitions between Susie's home and her Inbetween feels natural and heart-warmingly divides the impact of her murder with subtle flashes of inconceivable happiness that makes this film uniquely watchable and faithful to the source material.",The Lovely Bones

How anyone possibly make an underground room in the middle of a corn filed near a school without anyone noticing??? And the tearing it down afterward?? No one notices, especially when ever one is searching for Suzie!!! Another strange situation is when the murderer is trying to bury the huge heavy safe. After discovering his book is missing and that the sister has it and is going to show it to the law...how could he possibly get the safe in his truck in so short a time??? It took two men to get it to the dump site, so how could one man take it upstairs and into a truck? And why not park the truck near the dump site so the trip wouldn't take so long? The worst situation is when the sister comes home with the album and takes forever to show it to anyone!!! There must have been some missing scenes because all of the above just doesn't make sense. Then there are the endless ""special effects"" that go no where. More scenes should have taken place on EARTH and trying to find out what happened to Suzie. The ""heaven or out-of-earth"" scenes seemed interminable. This movie should never have been made. And as for Susan Sarandan...well...a real come down as her part made no sense whatsoever.

196,stargunner,surprised by the negative responses,9,21 January 2010,"Critics and viewers alike have been panning this film on all fronts. I walked in not knowing what to expect, being unfamiliar with the book and a Peter Jackson fan disappointed by his last film King Kong. While there were some pacing issues similar to his previous films, I thought The Lovely Bones was stunning and powerful.A lot of people have been making the enormously stupid mistake of comparing this film to Avatar on a visual and story level. Let's get this ridiculousness out of the way - Avatar's story was a re-hash of older stories, and the visuals were used to glaze it over. The Lovely Bones used visuals to help tell the story and tie-in plot elements - instead of a constant distraction to hide a bad story and cheeseball script.The Lovely Bones invokes every emotion at the right times. It is heartbreaking, thrilling, funny, full of joy, full of despair. It touches on a subject that we will all face one day (death) in a way that's down to earth and also full of imagination. Jackson did a good job interlacing the vivid and sometimes frightening 'in-between' world that Susie is in - giving that 'so close but so far away' feeling.Some of Susie's dream world was a little cheesy, but it is easily forgiven for a movie so lush and full of all the experiences of life. Excellent casting, beautiful visuals, and a very touching story. This film deserves more appreciation than it is getting. It is not only a great story, but a piece of visual art in a way so much more unique and special than films like Avatar. It seems most people that have seen the film do not agree, and that is unfortunate. Though if you were considering seeing the film and have been turned off by the reviews, I suggest you go anyway and you may be pleasantly surprised. It is one of the best films I have seen in a while.",The Lovely Bones

198,ad_upclose,A great surprise.,9,10 January 2010,"I have read the book, thought it had a dull second half, and felt it was going to be incredibly difficult to bring it to the screen. But Peter Jackson does a fantastic job with it. Now fans of the book may not like the chopping and changing done and will let themselves down if they simply compare everything to the book. But for me I'm glad for all the changes made, in fact I connected more emotionally with the movie than I did with the book.Peter Jackson mixes drama and some fantastic imagery really well to breathe life in this sad yet uplifting story. The scenes of the 'in-between' were beautiful and I didn't think he over-used them as much as the book did. Both Saorise Ronan and Tucci did a commendable job. I was actually glad the movie showed a lot of of Tucci's character; even with little dialog his character was intriguing.Overall, this movie was a big surprise for me. It was a quality film and if fans of the book can look at it as stand-alone movie, I'm sure they will appreciate it",The Lovely Bones
199,michelleoverton,Too long,6,8 April 2020,"Perhaps if it were shorter the movie would have saved itself. Only engaging up to Susie's death.

200,superstar49,Absolutely brilliant!,10,30 January 2011,"I ended up giving this movie a ten as it was just brilliant! Early on I had seen the promos for it and knew I would like a film like this. But I had no idea it would turn out to be this good.I briefly read and skimmed over some of the reviews, and the negative remarks made me decide to write my own review and express why this movie is so brilliant.First of all, I am half a century old and I grew up during the time frame this film takes place in. The early 70s couldn't have been reconstructed any more perfectly. Everything from the clothes to the people strolling in the mall took me right back to 1973. They couldn't have done a better job.Second, the young actress who played Suzie was perfect for the role. She has a beautiful spirit about her that makes you embrace her. She's so likable that that you care about her character and what happens to her.If the picture didn't send you as much as it did me, it's probably because you're not familiar or aware of what so many people believe happens after you die. The belief that after your body dies, you exist in a new dimension. The summary from the IMDb about a girl watching herself from heaven isn't exactly correct. She's not in heaven. She's merely in what many believe is a state of being, between earth and heaven, sometimes often often referred to as ""earth-bound"" as the movie depicts. Over ten years ago before I became familiar with such beliefs a film like this wouldn't have matter to me as much. But because I am aware of what many people believe happens to us after death, this was captured perfectly in this film. The filmmakers couldn't have done it any better. If I had any problems with this film at all it's that what a lousy actor Mark Wahlberg can really be. An actor is supposed to convince us that what he's doing is real and I just couldn't buy anything emoting from this man. Most every scene he was in I had to forget my criticism and just see what the character of the father was supposed to be feeling. I've never been much a fan of Susan Sarandon but she was just great as the grandmother. She had that 70s look down perfectly with that Jacqueline Susann's hairdo. Also, although his character was evil, Stanley Tucci was another reason for making this film so wonderful. He's hard not to like despite his vile character. I simply thought the film was wonderful and I really got something out of it. Definitely one of the best films to come around in a long time. Beautifully filmed. Nothing looked too fake or computerized in my opinion. Bravo!",The Lovely Bones
201,TigerHeron,Ludicrous and Offensive,3,16 April 2018,"Worse than a waste of time. The main character (the dead girl) does something stupid no one with an IQ over 70 would do in real life, resulting in her murder. Most of the movie is Disney-esque sequences of an afterlife, with no plot. The actual plot takes place on earth, but it consists of almost nothing. We see a family grieve, fall apart, come back together, and the murder is solved...except it isn't. The murderer gets away, and we're supposed to believe justice was served when, as an old man, he dies in an accident. Meanwhile, if you have a brain, you realize he had continued his serial rape/murders until his untimely death. In other words, it's a movie about spending his entire life getting away with rape and murder of girls and women. Hello? .",The Lovely Bones
202,jay632,disappointment...,4,22 January 2010,"Only reason I went to see this movie was not for the all star cast, not cause it was based on a book, but because of peter Jackson's story telling. I just have to say that I'm extremely disappointing in this movie... The problems lie with directing in this movie, not enough was done to make you feel anything for the characters. It's like a jumbo up messed of characters that had a couple of scenes not long enough for you to care about them. And there was way to much amount of special effects that wasn't needed in this movie. Why not spend the extra screen time developing characters. Its a shame, i see the premise of this movie, a sad story that could of been good, but was executed poorly that i didn't even care about the characters.The only character in this movie that got any development was Susie. She did a pretty good job playing her character. But as soon as you start to like her, Jackson would put some unnecessary special effect to cover her up... makes me think, what the heck was he thinking when he edited this film...Use to be a huge Jackson fan, but his last 2 films was so bad...",The Lovely Bones

It was my responsibility that my optimistic hopefulness let me down.Let me ""spoil"" it for you from the onset (so I can, hopefully, help you to save some time and money, as well as avoiding frustration): the 14 y.o. murder victim, after all kinds of disjointed, though picturesque, equilibristic created by Peter Jackson, gets revenge on her killer ""from beyond"" by sending him to his demise by the rather not too large an icicle. That's it. That's the story.The book, apparently, was good. The film, evidently, is bad. What can you do?! Not to watch it - that's what.Although it's difficult to compare ""The Lord of the Rings"" (1st of which I have watched and was bored to tears) with magnificent and significant ""Blow up"" - the flop of the ""The Lovely Bones"" can be compared with the box office flop of the ""Zabriskie Point"".

204,colin_coyne,Not quite there yet ...,7,28 January 2010,"THE LOVELY BONES – is a bit of an off-beat tale, based of the thoughts and feelings of a young girl ""Suzie Q"" Salmon (Saoirse Ronan) – watching over her family and reliving from beyond the grave the events that happened to her  up to and including her untimely demiseAlthough it was directed by Peter Jackson (Lord of the Rings Trilogy, King Kong) – some of the scenes and dream sequences may as well have been directed by Salvador Dali, as they are that surreal  but, these scenes are very well done The other members of the Salmon Family (Mark Wahlberg as Jack, Rachel Weisz as Abigail, Rose McIver as Lindsey, Christian Thomas Ashdale as Buckley, and there's a bit of a star turn by Susan Sarandon as Grandma Lynn) put in credible performances. There is also a good role played by Michael Imperioli (from the Sopranos) as Police detective Len Fenerman, and not forgetting the ""bad guy"" Stanley Tucci as George Harvey.I felt that to a large extent that this film had rather lost it's way a lot – a little akin to the main leads confusion over whether or not she should ""cross over"" to the other side or should stay around and watch over her family  it is a somber tale of a family trying to deal with loss mixed with injections of humour (by the excellent Susan Sarandon) again mixed with the Dali type surreal after-world scenes  THE LOVELY BONES was a little odd, basically unfocused – and that lead to the film being ultimately an unforefilling experience.As this is a fairly dark story dealing with a death in the family and how it effects everybody  with a fair bit of tension build-up (there is one bit in particular where you could hear a pin drop – as the audience was so quiet!) and several twists and turns  I would say that because of the subject matter and what happens to the girl (which I'm not going to give away here!)  I was a bit surprised at the 12A rating for this film  I would say that this film would be better targeted at a slightly older audience.THE LOVELY BONES is due for release on 29th Jan 2010.",The Lovely Bones

207,casch0101,"It's a no, no, no, Peter Jackson!...",4,16 January 2010,"Just *what* is this film, actually?. It's a sort of ""Mystic River"" meets ""Alice in Wonderland"". Some scenes are quite disturbing as if from a Harvey Keitel cum James Gandolfini sadistic duet movie, along with some Disney-like ""life is beautiful"" ad. Everything in this movie is wasted: Beautiful (and great actress)Rachel Weisz could have been a Ms. John Doe here...; monkey-faced Whaldberg keeps on confirming he cannot act!; the actress playing Susie Salmon is very pretty, and lovely and good actress...however she can't do much with such an awkward and erratic script. Whenever we are drawn to (finally!...) a detectivish thriller, we are next deviated (with no reason at all) to ""wonderland"". I even consider this film to be perverse as it toys with the idea of a teen girl being kidnapped, eventually raped and later killed, along with the overused cliché of magical ""in-between-life-and-death"" people communicating with the alive. Some scenes look like coming from any youngster playing with software such as Paint and Photoshop...Oniric scenes mixed with real-life deal disturbing police scenes. I just don't get it!. Where are people going when they even nominate an erratic film as this?",The Lovely Bones
208,trixie-k-88,"Okay, but could have been so much better",5,29 January 2012,"The Lovely Bones is not a good movie, but it's not a bad movie either. There are parts of it that are done well, and other parts that are done very poorly.Susie Salmon (Saoirse Ronan) is a normal 14-year-old girl growing up in the early 1970s. The main things on her mind are the boy she has a crush on and her hobby of taking photos. All of that stops when she is raped and murdered by her creepy neighbor Mr. Harvey (Stanley Tucci). After her death Susie watches her family, friends and murderer from heaven. While a spirit guide, Holly helps her deal with her emotions, Susie's family has little consolation. Susie's murder is unsolved, and her father (Mark Wahlberg) becomes obsessed with finding out who killed his child. Susie's mother (Rachel Weisz) struggles with her husband's fixation on Susie's murder, which strains their marriage. While their parents deal though the family tragedy Susie's siblings are often taken care of by their eccentric grandmother (Susan Sarandon). Now and then Susie also checks on her crush and a strange girl from high school with the ability to see ghosts. After years of heartache, confusion, hatred and resentment Susie and the people she left behind find closure, in both life and death.The Lovely Bones is the kind of movie you can't decide if you like or not. It has some fantastic visuals and cinematography when Susie is in heaven. Although some people think this takes away from the movie, I think it helps brighten the very dark mood of the film. Most of the acting is also good. Saoirse Ronan is excellent as the innocent girl struggling with her own death, and Stanley Tucci is even better as the creepy rapist next door. The emotions are very strong in the film, and it's hard to not find yourself crying during at least one scene. I also found it in good taste that they didn't feel the need to put in a graphic rape scene, it is simply implied. The scene after Susie realizes she has been murdered is much more powerful the way they did it. However, there are so many elements of the film that fall flat. The Lovely Bones almost runs under the idea that the audience has read the book. I read the book a number of years ago and still found myself confused. While Susie, Mr. Harvey, and sometimes Mr. Salmon and Grandma are played and characterized fairly well, the other characters seem almost inconsequential. It feels like half the story has been left out. I really don't know how they managed to leave so much out with the film being over two hours long. Along with that, the book spans over many years, and it seems that the movie is trying to portray that; but the actors for Susie's younger siblings are not changed. That might work for the 12 year old, but certainly not the five year old. Susie's crush was also poorly miscast with an actor nearly a decade older than Saoirse Ronan, who did not look like a 17-year-old. The worst part about that is that the love they have for each other and (without spoiling too much) the point of the conclusion of the book is so watered down that it feels almost meaningless.All in all, The Lovely Bones is worth seeing, but there are many things that will leave you wishing they worked harder on it.",The Lovely Bones
209,eucalyptus9,Vastly superior to the book,9,19 April 2010,"I'd heard the acclaim for the novel ""The Lovely Bones"" so got a hold of the book and found the first few chapters interesting and original. Before long, though, it descended into a tedious, boring narrative that eventually had me turning to the end of the book, to find one of the lamest endings to a story I'd encountered.Somehow, out of this tedium Peter Jackson has fashioned a fascinating and beautiful film. The beauty seems to come from his own visionary qualities - many of the scenes of the after life hark back to the imaginative settings he created for his early feature ""Heavenly Creatures'. He's removed some of the novel's subplots - the changing dynamics of the Salmon family with their community, and the affair between Len and Abigail, although the latter gets the merest hint, when Jack is thanking Len for his friendship, and adds, meaningfully ""And thanks for being such a good friend to Abigail."" Subtle. The film had a PG-13 rating in the US and so the rape of Susie is glossed over, but the way that Jackson conveys the horror of her murder, without melodrama and explicitness, is remarkably well done.The cast are universally good. Mark Wahlberg, who was the best thing about ""The Departed"", seems to have since embarked upon a series of shonky performances in atrociously bad films, but in this, he is again excellent. Susan Sarandon has an hilariously funny scene, and Saoirse Ronan is brilliant. She's not a classic screen beauty, but when her erstwhile boyfriend Ray says to her ""You are beautiful, Susie Salmon"", you can't help but agree. I guess that Stanloy Tucci gets the major kudos. He's unrecognisable at first, and his sinister predator is as much a landmark villain as Anthony Hopkins made of Hannibal Lecter.Like Mel Gibson, Jackson's hand as director is evident in all his films. His major flaw is a tendency to go on too damn long - The Return of the King, King Kong - and I thought this movie was heading in the same direction, but he's restrained himself here. Jackson has created a good body of work - Meet The Feebles is always worth another look - but I think that this is his finest film. 9/10",The Lovely Bones

I was coerced into watching this film by a friend and she loves it. I personally found it silly and given the subject matter WAY too family friendly!The acting was good, i can't take anything away from that, it's the story, script, outcome, subject matter and the way it is handled that has given it a low score.I haven't read the novel, although I've heatd it's a lot darker than the film. But this was almost trying to be a light hearted romp instead of what was actually pretty serious.*Minor spoilers, sort of*
And just a quick note about the ending,

All the above sacrificed from Jackson only to present us a fantasy colored and peaceful world (very beautiful indeed). Father (as a character and Wahlberg too) ties hard to make us sympathize him, mother ""disappeared"" just like that in the middle of the story and we can't understand her reaction and decisions about that, grandma (and Sarandon too) is a caricature of herself (and a 70's grandma), the child runs and cries like saint, the rapist (even though Tucci-Academy Award nominee- tries hard but in a wrong way full of ""monkish"" face expressions) finds the Justice he deserves, everyone in the film has the ""gift"" or ""instinct"" to feel the dead girl and communicate with this mid-area, everyone except the director.",The Lovely Bones

The story touched me and it showed very well how people react in different ways to the loss of someone dear. How couples can fall apart because of it and not because they don't love each other anymore. The actors played very well, especially Saoirse Ronan. Susan Sarandon was so great too! I loved the dreamy scenes of ""purgatory"" and ""heaven"", they were so beautiful and full of peace. The reunion scene with all the girls stirred a lot of emotion in me. The only thing is that this movie drags on and on with the subject, I was wishing she finally gets that damned killer somehow, but it never happens, so the end left me feeling really frustrated. I know the world is cruel and that there are in reality no endings like that..but hey, what is one of the main reasons people go to the movies? So they can dream...

213,ItalianBombshell,"Oh My Goodness, Totally Disagree With The PG-13 Rating",7,23 July 2015,"First things first. I really do not care how violent the book was. The book was also a work of fiction. I do understand that the author experienced a traumatic and particularly violent rape. And while the writing may have been cathartic, I commend Peter Jackson for his decision to omit this sequence from the film, realizing it would be horribly traumatic for the young woman playing the adolescent lead as well as for Stanley Tucci, playing the role of the child molester/murderer. While we are on the subject, I must say, I really have been fond of Stanley Tucci's body of work and considered myself a fan. I was so caught off guard by this performance. So taken aback by the physical transformation. I found myself puzzled and naggingly annoyed because I was unable to place him at first. Needless to say, when I finally figured it out, I was disgusted and had a physical response of overwhelming nausea. Apparently, I wasn't the only one. In interviews I later watched regarding his performance, I learned that Mr. Tucci, himself, was uncomfortable in this role. To such a degree, that he volunteered to alter his physical appearance as much as possible. And with that knowledge, bravo, Stanley Tucci, for a hauntingly disturbing performance. This film is not appropriately rated. PG-13 is incredibly young to deal with such weighty material. The immediate scenes after Suzie's abduction, encompassing her murder, the bathtub scene, and resulting 'cleaning scenes' were worthy of an R rating. There have been much, much less sec severe motion pictures rated R for violent, graphic content, despite storyline that this film should have been a no-brainer. Think about similar films, i.e. The Accused worth Jody Foster, Fried Green Tomatoes, and the like. Would you really allow your 13 year old daughter view these films? Take the sexual ambiguity out of the picture. Would you allow your 13 year old child watch Escape From Sobibor, Schindler's List, The Boy In The Striped Pajamas? Would it be too much? Too much seen, in graphic detail, to be unseen? Cue The Lovely Bones. No way. This cannot be used as a 'teaching tool' nor as a casual family movie with a teen. This is hardcore. Adult themes and graphic detail. NOT SUITABLE FOR CHILDREN, TEENS, TWEENS.",The Lovely Bones
214,BronzeKeilani26,2 thumbs up!!! Loved it!,9,4 January 2010,"Actually, I found this movie way more satisfying than I expected. Mark Wahlberg did a fantastic job as a grieving father! He hit it on the mark and had me crying so hard they had to bring me a handful of Kleenex. I also know he did a fantastic job because I am a mother who lost her only teenage son in the summer of 2006. My baby was the third victim in this man's life of murders. But my son's murder put him in prison and he was promptly murdered himself. So I can truly say that life here is nothing but a mass of cycles and as human beings, we get what we put out. Some ppl here didn't like the ending because her body wasn't found. But see, they missed the true message in the film which is also a lesson in life. Bad things and bad ppl doesn't matter & will NOT matter beyond and after. If we stay focused on the bad things in this life, we'll miss the good. Once she let go of her thoughts of revenge, things took it's proper course which is universal law. The killer got what he had coming. So it had a stunning payoff in my opinion. The film also lets us know to always pay attention & listen when you've lost a loved one. Dead doesn't mean dead and in spirit doesn't mean gone, and that's the truth! I was truly able to relate to this film as I'm sure many other parents who have lost children, will too. The film wasn't long & drawn-out. I thought it was satisfying and filled to the brim with suspense, emotions and beauty!

Susie is a 14 year old girl who is murdered and finds herself in a world that is somewhere in between heaven. She stays in this world to somehow contact her family into knowing who killed her.

I found myself feeling on the edge of my seat mostly throughout the movie. Like a best selling novel, it is something you can't just read a little and walk away from it. I generally don't like movies that depict things close to reality. Especially when there's something bad in it, as it gives me nightmares. If you don't watch this movie to the very end then you miss out a lot. You really have to pay attention to what is being said starting out or you kinda get lost. While the main character girl doesn't look beautiful as the movie describes her and certainly not what I would define as appealing, you do begin to see differently after a while. This movie seems to show how when evil looks like its winning, in thee end it doesn't. But there's another side of which love finally makes it mark even though it seems lost. Whether anyone sees it or not, I saw there's a returning consequence for everything we do in it. Unlike Ghost (1990) you are left wondering where where the bad and questionable people go in the afterlife. I wonder if anyone else sees that part missing. While it has it's dark themes there is beauty in it that makes it all the worth while of watching. I don't like the title of it because I feel it shoots the whole movie down from most seeing it. Because it's like other movie titles like Better Than Chocolate (1999) and Like Water for Chocolate (1992), which have nothing to do with chocolate. Or The Devil Wears Prada (2006), of which there's no devil in it. The title The Lovely Bones is kinda like Grateful Dead, which doesn't make sense. I almost get the feeling the writer(s) were trying to find a title which fits both good & bad aspects is why it was titled The Lovely Bones.",The Lovely Bones
218,merdiolu,I will remember you Susie Salmon,8,16 February 2013,"I watched this movie last night and immensely moved. Peter Jackson was not a director I hold in high regard unlike his other fans due to LOTR but here the story was touching and quite human. Susie's murder and its aftermath makes anyone to question if we can trust anyone in this society or if anyone who lives next door could be someone or something else. Aftermath Susie's narration of events , her time in her personal limbo watching , commenting and sometimes intervening to the events and lives she left behind were also dramatic material we see less in commercial movie productions. Saoirse Ronan was a new name for me but it is a name I will follow more closely in coming movies. For her age she performed quite admirably. Other actors are hit and miss though. Susan Sarandon and Rachel Weiss easily display their acting skills as wild grandmother and grieving mother. Stanley Tucci , another name I did not hold in high regard before was quite good and really surprised me as creepy and slimy serial killer. I can pass on Mark Wahlberg though. He just can not act. Besides in my opinion Jackson extended the movie too long. 135 min is unnecessary for this kind of story.Still thank you Susie Salmon and Peter Jackson for reminding the preciousness of the things we take for granted in this life. I will keep that in my mind more often.",The Lovely Bones

Susie doesn't get to see her grandfather, who is notably absent from the world of the living or any other of her loved ones. Rather, she gets to spend eternity with her killer's other victims. Maybe they will all get to spend eternity discussing the worst/last day of each of their lives. I guess these kids' deaths might upset their loved ones who are already in heaven, so they have to be isolated.The worst part is the timing coming just before the Murderer's demise. One is left wondering whether the Murderer's ""punishment"" will be to spend eternity with his victims.The one good thing about this movie (that moves it from a 1 rating) was the performance of Stanley Tucci.

And the way the murdered innocent child daughter is telling her own story. She is one time able to see the paradises also. But she refuses to give up. She wants revenge. She lost her love, her family and her life, everything. Just due to a Psycho neighbor. So she want him also to die any how. This is the story of that innocent, beautiful 14 years old girl. And on the screen this story has been told very uniquely and brilliantly. The silent and soothing music throughout the movie. The imaginable beautiful scenes that one can expect after death. Don't care about whether it is a CGI or a soul's perception. Overall I liked the movie. Watch without any pre-expectations and mindset. Forget about the novel etc. You will enjoy the movie. And the last but not least Saoirse Ronan is the most beautiful girl on this earth.",The Lovely Bones
222,Caribstu,Lovely Bones was so tedious my bones ached just watching it,1,1 February 2010,"The premise behind this film is a fourteen year old girl, Susie, in the prime of her youth and about to enter the emotional teenage stage of her life where peers and boys become so important, is robbed of the chance by a neighbourhood killer. Susie generates the films narrative, as she looks down from Heaven upon the events which unfold in the lives of those she left behind. A chance then to take an original idea, work a new dimension into the screenplay and produce a stunning cinematic work brimming with originality. Mark Whalberg's mediocre acting abilities were clearly stretched beyond their limits with a simple ""concerned father mime"" hospital scene, and throughout the rest of the film he was so wooden that you could imagine the Spartan's entering the gates of Troy in a giant Mark Whalberg. Both supporting ladies Rachael Weiss and Susan Sarandon, who are equally better than this film, must be wondering what they were possibly thinking when they read the screenplay and agreed to make the film. Watching The Lovely Bones was comparable to sitting in a dentists waiting room reading a four year out of date Cosmo. It was, in plain terms, a miserable experience filled with an overwhelming sense of painful disappointment and like the out of date Cosmo you'd seen it all before and knew exactly what was coming. The heavenly scenes were unoriginal, reminiscent of ""What dreams may come"", the narrative was broken and fuddled, the screenplay weak and sentimental trash when it should have been powerful and touching. At one point a ""cat n mouse"" scene toward the end of the film was the only highlight and yet that itself was both predictable, and routinely familiar. This film was in fact such long, boring, dreary self indulgent nonsense that I was convinced it had been directed by M Night Shylaman and stuck it out to the end only to watch the credits roll up ( the only interesting part of the entire film) just to see if I was right. I was wrong, but close enough, it was directed by Peter Jackson.... yawn",The Lovely Bones
223,bLuR-7,A huge let-down!,4,12 January 2010,"When I first read that Peter Jackson was working on an adaptation of The Lovely Bones, I was glad that he was venturing towards projects that were considerably different from the epic fantasies that had propelled him to stardom in the US. However, upon seeing the bloated mess that this film is, I'm beginning to think that Jackson is a better craftsman than he is a storyteller.That's not to say that the film is without its merits. The cast does a reasonably good job of bringing to life the somewhat leaden novel that the film is based on. Some of the sequences are filmed with the same nail-biting suspense and unflinching mastery you would expect from the director of modern cinema's most successfully audacious epic trilogy.However, the film also heavily suffers from trite voice-overs, a flaccid script, and an uneven tone (one minute you're sympathizing for the grieving family, next minute there's a comic montage involving the grandmother; one minute it's a suspenseful break-in, next it's a tearful reunion).And then there's Jackson's relentless reliance on CGI that does precious little to move the story forward. Do we really need to see an extended sequence showing a celestial Suzie modeling new outfits or bopping to beats on an over-sized record?A disappointing return to cinema from one of its greatest auteurs.",The Lovely Bones
224,MisterMxyzptlk,Bone deep.,1,31 August 2010,"Peter Jackson's disabled pseudo spiritual crime thriller is a mish mash of problems. Namely the fact it wants to be too many films in one. The flimsy out of this world experience that's lambasted with hackneyed CGI ideas is just one of the many issues. Take the Earth driven story about a family who is dealing with the abduction and potential death of their oldest daughter. The crime thriller takes on a rather ill conceived and disconnected hunt for the man behind behind the crime and yet nothing is really presented here to convince us that the progression to find him is at all feasible. Amidst the struggle to move on and keep his marriage together, Whalberg does his best Columbo impersonation and is finally on the case without any indication he knows what he's doing. Outside a scene of having him randomly throw darts at a board with suspects on it, I'm unsure as to how he arrived at any conclusion. If that wasn't bad enough, take into account the confusing portrayal of Susan Sarandon as either my Grandmother or Sharon Stone on Casino. There's a montage moment included in this film that had me wondering if I was watching Step Mom and Julia Roberts was gonna peek up from behind the couch. The spiritual storyline falls even flatter to the ground. The crackpot imagination of heaven, the audacious travelling and ramblings of the teen daughter caught ""in between"" keeps the real story at bay here. It generates farcical attempts to be real and important, and we know the film is trapped underneath all the glitz and frosting so that no one asks any questions. There was a crime all right, but the body wasn't the girl found in the cornfield.",The Lovely Bones
225,dangermous,dark and touching,7,4 January 2011,"unsettling subject matter, powerful film, dark, beautiful, touching a sad reflection on a subject matter where a story like this just adds to the bewilderment of why people do such things, very sad to watch perfect acting by all & brave director to take on such a film the story could have been more focused but i was glued to the screen due to empathy with some characters and loaving for others - an area where a lot of films fail. I feel the other reviewers who have said this is wishy washy and a load of rubbish have no imagination, you must allow yourself to be swept away with the film. If you can do that the cgi etc just enhances the film. Such people with no imagination should stick to watching soaps and the news!! do not watch this and expect to laugh or have fun afterwards its quite sad to watch.i didn't know what the film was about before i watched it so it hit me a little bit. please read IMDb main page for description of the film, these are my thoughts after watching it.a note to the geeks who have prattled on about a book it was based on. get over it. a movie is a vastly different media to a book and will never be the same. i wish people would stop going on about books when reviewing a movie. take it as it is. if i love a book that much i wouldn't watch the film based on it.",The Lovely Bones
226,anshul2001anshul,fabulous..makes you believe in relationships again,9,30 June 2011,"As such movie is sad because a young girl is killed and her killer roams free for many year but in many ways movie reinforces ideas of family, love and relationship. We Hindus offer food to birds, animals and priests even years after our near and dear ones have died in the hope that this might help them in after life. Similarly when Susan is tormented about scheming of his murderer or when his family reminisces about her she seems to establish a connection. Acting by her grandma, siblings and mom are superb. watched it when was back from office at 2 o clock in night and was impacted by it. and I actually like the special effects they add to the surreal feeling which movie tries to create. Comic interlude of grandma though seems slightly misplaced",The Lovely Bones
227,Poptart_Psycho,Proves a movie without gore can be more moving,8,2 November 2015,"Talented Peter Jackson has taken on Alice Sebolds novel, in my opinion hes done a great job. Not only was it well performed by top class actors it also had very little gore and violence but proved to be more moving.You have to take note of the first half an hour as young Susie Salmon narrates her life whilst it takes place up until her murder. Set in 1970s suburban Pennsylvania 14 yea old Susie is like no other girl her age apart from she has been watched by her neighbour and child killer Mr Harvey.The movie is not only just partly narrated by Susie it set between not quite heaven yet not on earth Susie isn't ready to cross over. And local girl Ruth who people deem weird as she can see the dead tries to help.The movie also highlights through Susie's narrations how her death has impacted everyone around her. Mother Abigail left the family, Dad Jack is determined to find her body and how her sister is the next target A very harrowing tale definitely worth a watch. Itsnice to see in an age of torture porn genres an actual crime drama doesn't need to be bloodthirsty",The Lovely Bones
228,rowiko,Disappointed & depressed,2,23 November 2010,"First the good news: I found the acting of all the key characters very strong and convincing. And some scenes were extremely powerful. For example where George Harvey tricks Susie to go with him and climb down into the hole in the field. I found myself willing her not to give in to him, all the while knowing that her fate was inevitable. Or where her sister breaks into Harvey's house and finds his scrapbook.However, that was not enough to make this movie a good experience for me. Quite frankly, it left me really depressed. Granted, a story where a teenage girl is murdered, is hardly going to leave you feel happy. But I found everything that happened just a little bit too much to cope. That her death would devastate the whole family is understandable, but her father's inability to cope, prompting him to almost get himself killed in the process as well, and driving his wife away, I found very painful to watch.There were two things, though, that disappointed me the most and which I found the most depressing. First the fact that Harvey manages to get the safe with Susie's body inside dumped in the hole in the ground, making sure for eternity that it will never be found. The build-up of that scene made my heart beat faster and faster, and I was waiting for someone (perhaps that ""strange"" girl living next to the dump?) to intervene in some way and make sure that the safe wouldn't end up buried in the dump forever. With every turn of the safe, which brought it closer to the hole, my heart rate increased. And then..., nothing. The hole swallowed the safe and Susie's body. Similarly, I was waiting and praying for the police to knock on Harvey's door and arrest him, or later on, when he had left his home behind, to catch him. But no, it took ""pure luck"" (or ""devine intervention""?) to seal his fate. OK, he was dead now, but to me this seemed too much of an ""easy way out"" for him.So what I'm missing most in this movie is CLOSURE. Closure for Susie's family - to see her murderer being brought to justice and her body to be found, for it to get a proper burial. And closure for the viewer. Instead, the only thing I felt when the credits rolled at the end was feeling depressed!",The Lovely Bones
229,ryandannar,"A shallow and dishonest exploration of grief and loss. ""Chicken Soup for the Grieving Soul."" Poorly conceived on every level.",1,23 December 2016,"Grief is a solemn subject for a film, one which requires a delicate touch. A film which hopes to portray grief in a meaningful way should ideally contain good dialogue, meaningful silence, and subtle, well-observed performances. As an example of such a film, I heartily recommend John Cameron Mitchell's ""Rabbit Hole."" It's quietly engaging, it takes its time, and it's truly and deeply moving.One movie I would not recommend is Peter Jackson's ""The Lovely Bones.""Jackson is not one for subtlety, or silence, or observation. Each of his films has been a monument to bombast. Jackson loves epic action sequences. He loves audacious CGI landscapes, and wildly soaring musical cues. He loves showmanship and melodrama.I've enjoyed more than one of Jackson's films. His talents have their place. Here, they are egregiously misapplied.Where to start? The problems with ""Lovely Bones"" are innumerable, starting with the basic premise and spiraling out in every direction.Saoirse Ronan gives perhaps the film's only good performance as Susie Salmon, a teenage girl who is stalked, raped, and murdered by a man who lives in her neighborhood. From a kind of limbo, her spirit looks down on the world and observes her family as they learn to deal with their grief and try to figure out who killed her.The film begins a few days before Susie's murder. From the afterlife, Susie narrates to us the events up to and through the moment of her demise. After her death, we watch as she runs, confused, away from the place of her murder and into a digital special-effects extravaganza known as ""the in-between,"" a kind of limbo where lost souls can look down on their families and get used to the idea that they're actually dead, before moving on to Heaven.From the outset, this film is pitched specifically toward a Christian audience. The words ""God"" and ""Heaven"" are pointedly used. And yet, the film doesn't really seem to be interested in engaging with the subject of faith, not beyond the notion that Heaven is beautiful in a sanitized Disney sort of way, and that maybe we eventually all become one, or something like that.An actual grief-stricken parent might have a crisis of faith. That might make for the stuff of a powerful film. The characters in ""The Lovely Bones"" aren't deep enough for that kind of mourning, and this film isn't interested in that kind of honesty. And so, outside of the film's dumb assumption that God and Heaven do exist, nothing is said about Christianity or the nature of faith whatsoever.Susie's father, Jack, is saddled with a lot of corny dialogue, and is given entire scenes which are utterly thankless. In one, which is inappropriately played as broad comedy, he breathlessly accuses every man he knows of murdering his daughter, as the detective in charge of his case rolls his eyes. The film is certainly going for laughs here -- but why? What an odd and ugly choice.Jack is played by Mark Wahlberg in a performance that comes across as so dopey, so cheerfully clueless, and so oddly flat at times, that it's hard to take any of his scenes seriously.Grandma Lynn, Jack's mother-in-law, swoops-in after Susie's death to help the Salmon family deal with their grief. As written, and as played by Susan Sarandon, Grandma Lynn is a broad comic archetype. Among the squeaky-clean Salmon household, she wears fur coats, chain-smokes, and drinks brandy during the day. She's obviously intended to represent a kind of ""sieze the day"" philosophy, but as the film presents her, she's merely ridiculous. The film doesn't allow the Salmon family to solve the mystery of Susie's death through natural means. Instead, Ghost Girl communicates with her father, imparting into him a ""bad feeling"" about the neighbor down the street. Then, Jack develops some photos Susie took just before her death, and -- shock of all shocks! -- the photos, which were taken by Susie as she passed a neighbor's yard, show THE NEIGHBOR in them!! And so, of COURSE Jack realizes that man is the killer.What kind of logic is this? What is the film trying to say? That we should trust our gut-instincts? But what about that earlier scene, where Jack was accusing every man he knew? That was gut-instinct, too! What makes this time any different from that? The film declines to answer such questions. I'm not sure it even realizes it's raising them.Susie's afterlife resembles a TV pharmaceutical commercial -- the kind where people stand in radiantly-green CGI fields, breathing in all the goodness that Advair has brought into their lives. Worse, as Susie meets other girls there, they hang-out in sequences which Jackson seems to have imagined as ""the best slumber-party ever!"" The girls have their pictures taken in an imaginary New York and see themselves appear on the covers of celebrity-gossip magazines. They go sledding down an impossibly-perfect mountainside in what looks like the set of an Old Navy ad. The overall effect is cheap and gaudy, overtly commercial, as far as one is likely to ever get from depicting a meaningful or poetic afterlife.Even the good aspects of this film are miscalibrated; for instance, Jackson brings a lively visual approach. The colors pop, the camera swoops and swoons around. But this kind of visual zest runs counter to the film's somber subject-matter. The same could be said about the overcooked musical-cues.""The Lovely Bones"" is one of the worst big-name films I've seen in a long time. It is poorly-conceived on every level. It aims to say something meaningful about grief. What it delivers instead is a pretty lie, a well of platitudes, a ""Chicken Soup for the Grieving Soul.""",The Lovely Bones
230,east-emerald,I read the book loved and still managed to fall for this movie,8,27 April 2010,"As a fan of Alice Sebold's ""The Lovely Bone"", I have been reading negative reviews of the movie with dismay for months. I made what was probably a mistake and read even more reviews on sites like IMDb after watching ""The Lovely Bones"" this weekend. The idea repeated in review after review goes something like this : Peter Jackson has gutted the story and left viewers with mostly an empty CGI shell. What can I say, I get it but very much fell for this movie. I can't imagine the number of choices that must be made when adapting a book into a movie. The pull to include as much as possible bumping up against the reality that you have to edit, edit, and then edit some more.In the story of Susie Salmon, her tragic murder and afterlife Jackson has chosen to make a sparse story that gives you, if not all of the details from the book, then at least the feeling of Susie watching her family from a distance and exerting subtle influence. We get what could almost be described as vignettes of her family's life in the wake of her death. She is meant to be moving on but is constantly drawn back by their grief and desire for justice.One element I'm surprised to find missing from all of the negative reviews is praise for the great performances. Saoirse Ronan as Susie Salmon is the literal and figurative voice of the movie. Her narration perfectly captures the sweet sadness that runs through the book and her portrayal of Susie before the murder is so endearing as to drive home even more the tragedy of what is to come. As a counterpoint to her role is Stanely Tucci as her killer. Without going overboard he perfectly portrays the idea of the nightmare you don't realize is living next door. I for one am glad his role is a bit subdued. I've tired of movies portraying serial killer's every motivation, fetishes and macabre details of the crimes. I'll admit the under use of Mark Wahlberg and Rachel Weisz is a mystery to me. Susan Sarandon deserves notice as Susie's grandmother, a woman after my own heart tackles life's challenges with a drink firmly in hand.I probably could not change the minds of those who feel Peter Jackson has ruined a beloved book but decided I could enjoy the movie that is and not worry so much about the one that could have been.",The Lovely Bones
231,moselekm,"No motivation for characters, plot, or suspense.",4,19 January 2010,"I really struggled with this movie. I remember seeing the previews on TV get progressively more in depth with the story. It starting out as a ""Murder Mystery"" to then a paranormal trip of ""we already know who done it"". And the paranormal side sort of intrigued me and was a large reason I even went to go see it. I was also interested in how a story like this would develop when from the get-go you already know who murders her.Needless to say, Peter Jackson makes no attempts at directing a movie that actually develops into a plot. It's a horrible plot that has no real direction and seems to attempt at tying loose ends in 'the after life'. So if you're going to see a suspenseful thriller, or a movie where there is some sort mystery, then go elsewhere. This movie doesn't offer much. In fact, it reminded me a lot of the book/movie: What Dreams Are Made Of. A very good movie.Peter Jackson seems to attempt to be artistic in this film and settles with imagery over anything else. There are some very cool aesthetic scenes, but really, they do nothing to drive the story. Not to mention they do nothing to develop a character. I just don't Jackson is cut out for Planet Earth. Perhaps he should just stick with Middle Earth and let the proper directors work out the realistic movies. He can have his orcs.In conclusion, this movie was pretty bad. The acting and everything was good, but you're really left wondering what the purpose of the whole movie was. In fact in the end. If you don't really hate this movie, you're just a Jackson-fanboy and should just be thankful your parents still buy you movie tickets.",The Lovely Bones
232,Theodor16,Inadequate movie of a director resting on his laurels,4,28 January 2010,"Oh man, Peter Jackson! What a mediocre movie and an outright insult that was! Why?A mediocre movie because you failed to thrill or move the audience, a patchwork of scenes that didn't believably convey the pain and struggle that could be expected in such a situation. Admittedly Saoirse Ronan is acting nicely but she couldn't single-handedly save this confused film. And outstanding actresses like Rachel Weisz and Susan Sarandon degraded to minimal roles wouldn't save an incoherent screenplay.It was also an insult to the fantastic novel of Ms. Sebold! Away with the subtleties, the deep melancholy meditation on life and relations, and the long and wearing healing process that is fabulously described. So, folks, I highly recommend that you read the book and forget about this mess of a movie as quickly as possible.",The Lovely Bones
233,iheart_ny,A mostly lovely wallow in deep depression,7,26 May 2010,"Some drama films are the kind that you feel emotional resonance for the characters, feel mildly engaged by the plot, think about it for a few seconds after leaving the theater, get into your car, get annoyed at a stupid driver, and quickly move back into your own life. The Lovely Bones isn't that kind of movie. Director Peter Jackson, of Lord of the Rings and King Kong fame, doesn't seem like the most obvious choice to direct the adaptation of the seemingly untouchable Alice Sebold novel, but he does his best, by staying close to the source material, but occasionally taking things out here and there. He also brings a lot of ah-mazing CGI shots that are so gorgeous, they may be worth the price of admission alone, and I doubt we would've had that type of a movie if anybody else had directed it. However, you get the feeling that Jackson paid too much attention to the CGI aspect, while he could've dealt with the center plot issue with more directorial sensitivity, mocking the same way the book was written, and that's what stops this from being a perfect movie. The plot centers around Susie Salmon (played by Saoirse Ronan), a 14-year-old girl who is raped and murdered in 1973. Ronan was absolutely perfect in this role. She showed promise in the 2007 film Atonement, where she also played a terrified youth who is dealing with an unbelievable situation. In the film, Susie is watching over her family, the boy she was in love with, and her killer -- from her own personal heaven. Stanley Tucci nails his role, playing the demented serial killer Mr. Harvey. He gives a particularly chilling, and uncannily believable performance, showing more versatility with every film he makes, you can tell that he really got lost in this role, because his part isn't one of those where you find yourself wondering what the actor has previously starred in -- you see his character, and he does a damn fine job at it. Mark Wahlberg and Rachel Weisz and Susan Sarandon play Susie's family, and each of those roles require the actor to display quite a lot of emotion, grieving her loss, and they all do terrific work, causing you to feel the extreme remorse that their characters do, and I really don't know if better actors could have been selected to play the respective parts. Nikki SooHoo plays Holly, a girl who Susie meets in heaven, another victim of Mr. Harvey. Her role is particularly memorable, serving as something of a reassuring voice to the Ronan's character, and I see her doing great things in her future, because, while being an unknown actress, she shows just as much talent as the other actors in this all-star cast. The core of this movie, however, the reason to go and see it in a packed theater, doesn't lie in its acting, or the writing, or even the direction. It lies in the story. We've all wondered what happens to us after we die. The Lovely Bones suggests that we go to a world that we think is perfect, but we're still haunted by the things that troubled us in our lives. And while the movie leaves you heartbroken, wanting to spend every day you have on this earth as your last, it leaves you pondering your own life, the significance of it, how you'll be remembered. And that's something I particularly like in a film, when it not only moves you to the point where tears are flooding your eyes, but when it leaves you with a great deal of psychological issues to ponder, about your own life, and what comes after your life is ultimately over. And that's what The Lovely Bones does. And while staying true to the source material, that's all a fan of this story can ask for.",The Lovely Bones

235,marais-alexander,"I'm sorry, this is good.",10,20 September 2013,"A lot of people have trashed The Lovely Bones for being derivative, or for straying from the book. I have to admit I agree and disagree in both departments. I saw the movie before reading the book, but since have and have to admit I can comprehend where all the hating of this movie comes from. The book is a grim, gore-soaked (the beginning, that is) odyssey about redemption (the family coming together again). The movie is a grim, but lyrical and angelic tale about Susie Salmon, with everything on earth coming second, or even third, from her. The book made the Heaven Susie lived in sound like a positive version of The Further from Insidious, essentially a colorful copy of the world she left. In the film, the Heaven or In- Between she lives in is more stereotypical. Blossoming fields, ever-changing seasons. The film is very smart about capturing what a fourteen-year-old girl would want for her Heaven. I think the film isn't entirely original, but takes an angle of the life-after-death fable I haven't seen before. It's fantastical - not gritty and real like the book - because it's almost like a daydream in Susie's head. Kudos to Peter Jackson for that, and for overall his unique approach. The film seems more like a set of environments in its character's psyches than in the here-and-now. The flashes into Mr. Harvey's subconscious (Stanley Tucci) confirm this. It is a bold way of making a movie on such a heavy topic, but a lovely one at that. And that's a miracle.",The Lovely Bones

Just when she's ready to taste love and her first kiss, she falls victim of a murderer living in her neighbourhood.She goes to a place between heaven and earth, and hangs out for a while till she is ready to move into Heaven proper. Looks like a real funky place not unlike Disneyworld. Anyway, so we see all the usual ghost story stuff. Dead people unable to leave for some unfinished business, dead people temporarily moving into other people's bodies, etc etc. Add to that a truckload of CGI and you've got yourself a silly story dressed up in some even sillier clothing.There's a serious issue of losing a child to murder, trying to find the culprit and/or some closure. But there's the totally laughable premise of heaven, in-between, ghosts, and most importantly the infantile CGI, which really makes a mockery of the entire theme.Interestingly, the actual crafting of the film is not half bad, it has a nice pace, well-made moments. But like another reviewer stated it, good craftsmanship does not a good story make.I've been used to seeing such childish stuff from Peter Jackson, if I had know he was the offender of this particular crime, I would have avoided it no question.",The Lovely Bones
237,cl777,A decent adaptation- Pretty bad but I was disappointed with the book too,6,2 February 2010,"The Lovely Bones famously tells the story of Susie Salmon, a girl who is brutally murdered (and in the novel of the same name, also raped) at age 14, by a serial killer living across the street from her in suburban America in the 1970's. She goes on to watch her family, friends, and killer, from ""her heaven"" in the sky.I was riveted by the beginning of the best selling book by Alice Sebold, to the point that when Fabio came to bed later than me one night he nearly gave me a heart attack as I seriously mistook him for a murderer. Similarly, the movie's beginning enthralled me, but later I was bored by the lack of plot and became severely disinterested. What started as a faithful adaptation with the penguin in the snow globe trapped in a perfect world, then turned into lots of liberties taken by director Peter Jackson, many for better, some for worse. For instance, huge, uninteresting chunks of interactions in school between Susie's friends are removed. Also, an unbelievable and difficult to comprehend affair between Susie's mom and the detective on the case is omitted. A scene in the book where Susie returns to Earth to have sex with Ray, her first love, is also taken out, thankfully, since during this encounter he doesn't even ask her who killed her, and is replaced by a much shorter but only slightly more logical kiss. Some incongruities remain (the murderer kept her body in a safe for about 10 years???) but overall Jackson does a good job weaving this story together and making a somewhat coherent movie out of a book which I found too long and dull after the first 50 pages.Jackson definitely adds his touch to the elaborately imaginative heaven, focusing on it a lot more than in the novel, giving the landscapes vivid colors and sweeping views. This is overdone in my opinion but to his credit it must be difficult to depict what heaven should look like without making it look fake. His love of special effects is obvious but one part reminded me too much of a scene from Gladiator, where Russell Crowe sees his deceased wife and son walking in fields of yellow, with an almost identical song playing.Back at home, Mark Wahlberg and Rachel Weisz play Susie's parents but neither performance blew me away as we don't really feel their pain or what they are going through, or why Susie's mom leaves to California for many years. Susan Sarandon as the crazed grandmother was not bad although her drinking, smoking, setting the house on fire character was very exaggerated. The girl interpreting Susie, Saoirse Ronan, was good, with her large, light blue eyes giving her an ethereal quality that matched how I imagined her.Stanley Tucci was creepy and almost unrecognizable as George Harvey, Susie's killer, but not deep enough to be truly scary. Without wanting to give away the end, I thought he was too easily dispensed with although this matches what happens in the book. It seems everybody wanted to wrap things up as quickly as possible. Having only just finished the novel which disappointed me after all of the hype, I wasn't enthralled with its movie adaptation either. However, despite many flaws, in some cases it actually improved the story presented in the book.My rating: 6 Fabio's: 7 Total score: 13 Please read more daily reviews at http://paulinasmovies.blogspot.com",The Lovely Bones
238,liamforeman,"Not the worst, but....",2,9 May 2021,"I won't give it only one star, because I did make it through to the end. I was kind of hoping for a resolution, or really a meaningful plot. I hadn't read the book, so I kept my imagination open. The CGI wasn't bad per se, but I couldn't understand ALL the time they spent on them. At the expense of making sense of what was going on in real life. Mark Wahlberg stood out for me due to his really wooden acting. It was like we were transported back to him playing Dirk Diggler in his first movie role where his acting didn't matter but we still could see he wasn't very good at the craft. This was excruciating to see him just perform so noticeably bad. I didn't get the ending. The younger sister runs into her home after fleeing a murderer with the book full of evidence and then sees her mom return home after what (?) a week? Month? Years? Who knows. No urgency to get that book to the police. Just bizarre. And to make it all worse, what was the point of the goth-like girl who lived across from the sinkhole? I figured she'd stop Tucci from sending it down into the pit, but nope we watch it disappear and now realize her remains will never be found. So what was GothGirl's actual point of being in this? And then for MarkW to get beaten almost to death for breaking up an amorous teen couple?? I can understand him getting punched a couple of times, but it seemed odd for a teen kid to go full on murderous rage. Is he supposed to be the next ""bad guy"" in the sequel? I want to read the novel now, but then it will probably annoy me just how bad this film was done. I wouldn't recommend it.

Peter Jackson is Peter Jackson. But what a letdown this movie was for me! Stanley Tucci states in an interview posted here on imdb, that he almost did not accept this role. That reticence is perhaps what I was picking up on in this movie. He is a great actor, but this role as a rapist-murderer does not suit him. He even balked, during the making of the movie, at having his character assault his victim. But there is much more contributing to the disappointing quality of this film.

242,girllovesmovies27,Read the book BEFORE you watch film...,8,3 August 2011,"That way, you'll actually understand the significance of the film and why it is the way it is! Susie is telling the story while she is in the in-between, after she has already gone. The scenes in the in-between are there because in the book they are there (from what I recall). The effect going back and forth in time between the real world and in-between is meant to be somewhat mystical and mysterious, almost dreary, yet striking emotionally. There are several emotionally striking scenes where there are juxtapositions between the two states (reality and in-between) that drive this movie. For one, when Mr. Salmon throws down his ship models and they break into pieces, that is also portrayed in the in-between world in quite a real and dreamlike way. When Susie sees Ray in the gazebo and tries running to him through the cornfield in the in-between and then starts sinking into the water and this is juxtaposed between the reality scene of her killer driving to the water spot/lake to throw her charm bracelet into the water is yet another instance. There are so many beautiful and tragic moments like these. The strength of this film is the acting. I was impressed by Wahlberg, Ronan, and McIver. Wahlberg's Jack really drives the story. The father-daughter relationship is extremely significant in The Lovely Bones. Ronan's Susie, is absolute perfection. I think she played her role very well. I also enjoyed watching McIver as Susie's sister. All in all, this film has a great cast. I would have liked to see the film develop more of the story you read in the book, but I understand you cannot show everything. I really liked reading The Lovely Bones, and I think this movie serves as a great companion piece to the book.",The Lovely Bones

244,jonandshellie,"Solid acting, but it suffers",7,17 October 2010,"I went into seeing ""The Lovely Bones"" with a sense that I was going to see a TV-movie-of-the-week with a bigger budget. A movie about a missing child found murdered and the parents struggle to solve the case that the police have allowed to grow cold. The movie succeeds at staying away from this overly-used cliché. I had never read the book and found myself entertained by Susie's personal heaven and the euphoric surrealism of her existence in the plane between heaven and earth while she tried to sort through the pain and confusion surrounding her murder, as well as her ill-fated attempts to at first reach out to them and then to finally console her family in the wake of the crime. It is less of a movie about redemption and more about learning to let go, regardless of how painful it may be.I liked the movie and found the story interesting. The acting was superb and Stanley Tucci was especially creepy as the solitary neighbor who would eventually lure and then murder Susie. That being said, the movie seemed to stop short and was lacking in a few spots. The emotions seemed to grow as cold as the case in the film and I simply found the actions of the family unbelievable (Susan Sarandon's whimsical, devil may care attitude in the wake of the murder is especially odd). I couldn't imagine the horrors of losing a child in this way, but I'd imagine that the emotions and feelings would not be as fleeting as they are in this film.Overall, it was a solid film. Not the best thing Peter Jackson has ever made, but not the worst either (I'd give that honor to the dreadful ""King Kong"" remake).",The Lovely Bones

246,thefilmguy7,The Painful Bones,4,23 January 2010,"I'm very impressed at how far Peter Jackson could fall from the quality of Lord Of The Rings. The Lovely Bones was at times painful to watch. All of the grace and talent that he showed for adapting J.R. Tolkien's masterpiece is absent here for the most part. True the performances were good. It was visually interesting. It also had a great Hitchcock type of moment nearer to the end. Otherwise though this film was very disappointing. I might even go so far as to say that it is in the top ten worst films of the year possibly. There were so many plot threads that were either terribly tied together or were not tied at all. The narrative and focus of the films themes and character developments were a mess. There was so much screen time wasted on dead ends and empty scenes. Humor was also always misplaced and inappropriate. The music choices never fit the tone. Some of the dialogue and atmosphere in some scenes were filled with more cheese than a Sandra Bullock romantic comedy. The three stars I give this film mainly go to Stanley Tucci, for a creepy performance, and Saoirse Ronan, a talented young actress and some of the visuals. There were about three to four scenes max that I thought were pretty well done. Those scenes take up maybe a little over twenty minutes of the film and considering that the running time is 135 minutes, that's pretty sad. Wait for this one to come on HBO.",The Lovely Bones

A father who would do anything to find the killer of his beloved daughter. A spiritual character looking over her family. A murderer who almost gets away with it but in the end maybe not. Some nice plot twists. Some corny heaven scenes and mysterious friends guiding her to her destiny in heaven. I don't know. It's all been done before. But you know, there is something special about this movie that I can't explain.Maybe it's the acting. The young lady playing Suzie Salmon is wonderful. Even if the part is kind of corny. She's beautiful and I think she has a great future ahead. Stanley Tucci is almost unrecognizable, and it's hard to picture him as a villain. But he sure does convince. Donny Wahlberg makes you feel the loss a father would feel in this situation. So yeah, the acting is very good.But the story is so nicely packaged. And the spiritual and earthly characters so nicely intertwined that it's almost believable. And almost makes one believe this kind of connection exists. Personally, I don't think it does.

It's not a bad movie, but it's sanitized (and rightfully so) and filled with warm, colorful imagery that reduces the impact of the horror of a brutally murdered child. As a result, we don't connect to the grieving of the family nor do we get swept away in the CGI afterlife.

250,prateak09,A movie that could have been a masterpiece which sadly isn't...,5,30 May 2011,"If there's one thing I dislike more than a bad movie it's a bad movie with aspirations of greatness. This movie wants to be great. A work of art. Possibly a masterpiece. I have no doubt that Oscars were whispered of at some point during production. But here's the catch: it's no good.Something strange happened with the adaptation of Alice Sebold's novel ""The Lovely Bones"" by Peter Jackson and his collaborators. The book was one of the most read in the country after it was published. Unfortunately, what comes out on the screen is far from what Ms. Sebold wrote about, so the finished product is, at times, irritating, at best. The mere thought of translating the text into a motion picture, must have been a daunting work on the part of Mr. Jackson, Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens.The story is a very intriguing one, but it is quite slow complete with holes and any parts that strived to be heartbreaking came across as mawkish. The script is quite weak often. But what hurt the film most was some aspects of Peter Jackson's direction. Jackson is a good director don't get me wrong(he was the main reason that I wanted to watch the movie), but he does make some decisions that detract from the impact of the story rather than enhance it. Especially with the CGI, not that it was bad CGI in fact it looked quite good, what I mean was that there was a complete overload of it and I think some of it was unnecessary. The movie is overloaded with fantasy scenes with too-loud sounds, and it omits much of the thoughtful narration of the murdered girl. The movie veers from mystery to fantasy, back and forth, satisfying neither format. And the small love-story between Susie and Reece is not portrayed with panache and it feels nothing more than a puppy love.The Lovely BonesHowever, the film does look absolutely beautiful, with beautiful scenery and cinematography. The score gives a haunting, eerie and intoxicating quality too. While the story is flawed, there is a good atmosphere especially in the more chilling scenes, where they are quite chilling and that's an understatement. Apart from two performances, the acting is quite good. The best performance comes from the very promising child actress Saiorse Ronan, who is just tremendous here. She was perfect for the role. She has a beautiful spirit about her that makes you embrace her. She's so likable that that you care about her character and what happens to her. Thanks to the sweet-faced and deeply affecting Ronan, you'll never forget Susie Salmon. Stanley Tucci is very chillingly effective too, and Mark Wahlberg is surprisingly good. The two performances I wasn't so taken with were Rachel Weisz, who is wasted. She would have had a lot of scope for acting out her grief if the movie had stuck with the book, instead of rushing her out to the wine country of California and making it look like she had been away for just a few months. And then there is normally solid Susan Sarandon, who overplays quite badly. She plays the child's Grandma Lynn who appears early in the movie and does not really help the weak screenplay. Mark Wahlberg as the grieving father is just adequate. I believe the weak screenplay limited both him and Rachel Weisz.The music, as opposed to fantasy sounds, is excellent. The locales are authentic and well-shot. The writing of dialog in the real-life ""mystery"" scenes is good. But there is an abundance of fantasy scenes which for us added nothing and frustrated our enjoyment of the plot and good acting. There's also a thriller aspect to the movie, and this part is well-done, but it's also overwhelmed by the excessive fantasy scenes.Instead of focusing on how Suzie's feelings evolved while she was in the in between place, after her murder, Jackson resorted to inordinate amounts of special effects. The CGI worked well in Lord of the rings and Kingkong, but this movie needed a different kind of handling, with CGI being used only where essential. The special effects in this movie are overpowering and they eclipse the movie.So, a movie that could have been a masterpiece which sadly isn't. Loads of plot holes, Unsatisfying ending and the unnecessary use of CGI spoils the movie So I rate it 5.5 out of 10.",The Lovely Bones

The dialog is very childish, and the girl who played Susie Salmon is god awful. She has only 3 emotional states throughout the movie,happy, yet so confused about everything that is going on, and helpless whilst screaming every once in a while from heaven to her parents who cant hear her. The main problem I had about this movie was, who exactly was the target audience? kids or adults?. It was a cross between a drama (that I must admit had a very disturbing scene) and The Chronicles of Narnia, so which is it? because both of these just doesn't work.The only thing I liked was the actor Stanley Tucci, who gave a great performance as the killer. Mark Wahlberg was completely wooden as usual. The CG was just too much, and the story got way over the top completely very quick. I knew Id hated it 5 minutes into it.",The Lovely Bones

While unimpressed by ""Wonderland"" I was excited, hyped and unbelievably ecstatic for ""Bones"". The trailer, set to the Cocteau Twins' ""Alice"" was picturesque, and imaginative. I couldn't wait for the release.In the end the CGI was overdone and sugary, but that was expected. Though to be fair, in the beginning, it was beautiful. When Susie first experiences ""her heaven"" I cried, it was so beautiful it was overwhelming. I think I had a brief glimpse of what Stendhal Syndrome (look it up) must feel like. And yet, forty minutes later, the magic wore off and I was bored of it.The acting was superior, especially by Saoirse Ronan and a few particularly heartbreaking scenes with Rachel Weisz and Mark Wahlberg but for the most part, the rest of the characters had no depth and no motivation. While well acted, they were certainly poorly written. The only redeeming part about this movie is Ms. Ronan's superb acting, and ability to become a character. I was so enamoured with her character, her role in Atonement never even crossed my mind.However, while Stanly Tucci has been lauded and smothered in praise, I saw nothing in his character that couldn't have been done by a half dozen other actors. While the things he did were creepy and chilling, his acting, while on point, wasn't anything to write home about. His role left absolutely no lasting impression on me. He had a few lines, but other than the implied creep factor, what did he do? What was his motivation? I guess we'll never know.I was under the impression that this was going to be part drama, part thriller, and yet, I was wrong. Nothing thrilling nor dramatic happened other than a few pivotal scenes that eventually sputtered and went no where.

This movie wants its imagery to be that good, but, it isn't.The plot then is rather predictable and the results, except for the means the protagonist is ultimately ""handled"", just goes along without any great suspense or anticipation.Such a loss is tragic in a family.

Its more like Heavenly Creatures - and I'm glad he went back to that kind of thing. Another quite sensitive portrayal of teenage girls, more attempts to give a portrayal of murder that asks questions of its audience. Don't expect action. There has been a lot of criticism of this film as an adaptation of the book, which I haven't read, but I must say all the comments about things missing in the film are about things that I think are there. The characters are well drawn and played - especially the main girl who is wonderful, and Stanley Tucci as the bad guy who is absolutely stunning. We certainly do get a sense of how the girl's spirit was such a vital part of the family and how they are devastated by her loss. But Jackson has chosen to make this film about Suzy, which inevitably makes it an unusual film, in that she is no longer part of the real world. Its a genuine attempt to be soulful and sensitive to a dreadful subject area, and is fairly successful. I was quite moved. The film is rather uneven in pace and one does feel that a lot has been cut. However, this has to be done. Bits are missing, but the performances are good enough to have us imagining a lot of processes - such as the parent's grief - occurring off-camera. I certainly felt that this was present, and I felt it played a part in the film.

259,john-souray,Comic book spirituality for the me generation,1,13 July 2010,"I haven't read the book, and on the basis of this film, I'm not sufficiently intrigued to want to, though I was puzzled leafing through a copy in a bookshop. Its admirers had led me to think that one of the problems with this film was that it couldn't hope, in just 130 minutes, to capture the richness of incident and character development in the book. I had in mind, therefore, a substantial doorstop of a novel, and was a bit surprised to find it ran to barely 300 pages, in a medium font with generous spacing. Not a doorstop at all. More what Stephen King knocks off over a weekend and calls a short story.Still, I'm not here to criticise the book, and I wouldn't normally bother with the film either, feeling it just wasn't my sort of thing and that I'd nothing useful to add. But there is something about the tone of some of the reviews here – mostly those approving and giving nine/ten stars – that is just so provocative. The allegation, made several times (though I won't quote anyone as it's not the function of IMDb to take up individual disputes), is that those of us who didn't like it are lacking some component of emotional intelligence, unable to relate to an adult plot that deals with feelings and character, and that we can only enjoy films full of explosions or fights or gore. It's an insufferably smug, patronising view, and I have to try to rebut it.The problem with this film is not that we don't understand emotions. Rather we understand them only too well, and we can see this film's sentimentalised view of the world for what it is. At best, cloyingly kitsch; at worst, poisonously selfish and narcissistic.Let me give an example. The young woman, Susie, who dies, had a boyfriend, Ray. Well, a boyfriend of sorts. We don't find out anything about him. Intriguingly, his surname is Singh. Is he a Sikh? Who knows; we know nothing about his background, his parents, his outlook, his hopes or ambitions. Cinematically, he's just a pretty boy. The two characters exchange no more than a few words, snatched by the visual cliché of the high school ""lockers in a corridor"", at which they set up a tentative date (which death will prevent).This is not Romeo and Juliet, not Abelard and Heloise; Tristan and Isolde did not have a tryst in a shopping mall. This is basically a teenage crush, fuelled mostly by rampant hormones. Yet we're supposed to believe that this is a grand love affair which echoes down the dimensions and transcends the grave.There's a rather creepy sideline to this. The grandmother Lynn (Susan Sarandon playing I take it the wise old crone archetype), has a ghastly conversation with Susie in which she wants to know whether Susie's kissed him yet (I think I'm right in believing that at this stage she hasn't even spoken to him). I mean, I'm a tolerant, liberal sort of a person, and I certainly wouldn't want a young person's sexual development clouded with guilt and repression. But for heaven's sake, she's only 14. It's one thing to take a permissive attitude, quite another to egg her on.But this kiss is important, as we shall find out. In a barely disguised metaphor of virginity, a myth is being created about your ""first kiss"". The aunt dreamily reminisces that nothing subsequently ever quite equals it.This comes to a head at the end of the film. There is a secondary, rather intriguing character called Ruth, a semi-outsider who, despite being fey, appears to have some intelligence and insight, and who strikes up a friendship with the forlorn Ray. This in itself is very strange; it's as though the author or scriptwriter had created this character to fulfil some important plot function, but then thought better of it, yet not bothered to cut out the character. You think, at the end, that this character is going to execute some crucial plot revelation, having seen Susie's ghost in circumstances that might be expected to tell her something important, but instead she just faints and drops out of further consideration.Ray rushes over, concerned at his friend's/lover's (we don't know for sure) collapse, and in affection kisses her on the lips, only to discover (to his apparent delight) that it is Susie that he is kissing.Well, I'm sorry. Call me pedantic, emotionally stunted, whatever you like. But excuse me for worrying; what about poor old Ruth? What about her happiness? What about her ""emotional journey"", and her ""closure"" and ""healing"", and all the other self-regarding psychobabble spouted by the me generation? What about her chances of forging a relationship with Ray? Gone. She now knows, for sure, that she will only ever be second best to his real love. She doesn't even get her kiss - it's stolen from her by a ghost. And once stolen, remember, it's gone for good, or so we're led to believe.It's actually despicable. This is having your emotional cake and eating it. It attempts to deliver some sort of mature message about ""letting go"", but actually what it really says is that even in death, you can have it all, and at no matter what cost to anyone else. This is the real objection that some of us have to this film. Not that it tackles emotions like grief, but that it does so in a crass, sentimentalised, and profoundly selfish way.I should give this film a few more stars - the two young women, McIver and Ronan, do well, as of course does Carolyn Dando playing Ruth, and Tucci is as reliable as ever - but I think they'll enjoy success anyway. This is a high budget production by a leading director, and it needs to be judged by the severest standards.",The Lovely Bones

And that's without reading Sebold's acclaimed book. But kudos to Jackson, Walsh and Boyens for their beautiful soul searching rendering of such tough, heart wrenching subject matter. All the chatter of the CGI this or that. I thought the heaven sequences were stunning, fantastical, wondrous and masterfully interwoven with the story. I thought Jackson was in rarefied form and his directing was chillingly effective. *Spoiler*--When Susie Salmon (Saoirse Ronan) was lured into George Harvey's (Stanley Tucci) underground chamber, the scene shifting back and forth from the chamber to the Salmon's dinner table as the tension continually mounted was nothing less than Hitchcockian.Each and every character was well drawn and vital to the story's outcome. Tucci is an obvious shoe-in for Best Supporting actor, but Mark Wahlberg's performance was so well-tuned and nuanced it may have been even more impressive. Ronan and Rose McIver (Susie's sister Lyndsey) deserve serious award consideration as well.I watched this movie twice, and enjoyed it even more the second time. In my opinion ""The Lovely Bones"" should be a front runner for Best Picture, as well as serious consideration for Best Director, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Actor, Best Supporting Actor, Best Actress and Best Supporting Actress. It's that good.When I first read that the Lord of the Rings trilogy crew of Jackson, Walsh and Boyens were doing this book I was to say the least a little skeptical.

262,phantom_fan89,There may be a few bones to pick but there still a lot of lovely evident,8,5 January 2010,"FOR MORE Reviews FEEL FREE TO VISIT http://rantsreviews4filmnuts.blogspot.com/ Peter Jackson's adaptation of Alice Sebold's best selling novel is deeply flawed. It is also deeply haunting, deeply moving and one of the most unforgettable film experiences of this or any other year.Fourteen year old Susie Salmon watches over her family from the afterlife as they attempt to piece their lives back together after her brutal murder. But even in death Susie is still haunted by what has happened and becomes consumed with bringing the perpetrator to justice.The subject matter is tough to say the least, but Jackson handles the material beautifully. Young Susie's rape and murder is never gratuitous, in fact very little of the crime is actually seen as Jackson opts to employ the use of haunting symbolism rather than brutal realism to imply what has happened. In turn Jackson's powerful imagery hits more disturbingly close to home than one could possibly imagine.Jackson is the master of imagery and the film is glorious to look at. For a movie with such a dark subject matter, it may be surprising to learn that The Lovely Bones is steeped in vibrant colour. Both in life and death Jackson creates visually interesting worlds for Susie to inhabit, both in an authentic recreation of 70's suburbia in both look and feel and a heavenly universe rife with symbolism and magnificent imagery. This being so the scenes featuring Susie in the afterlife, whilst visually stunning, serve to derail the pace of the film.The Lovely Bones gets off to an excellent start. We are introduced to Susie and grow instantly attached. She is smart, witty and endearingly naive, everything a likable heroin should be which makes the knowledge of her impending doom even harder to digest. The film is a unique mixture of light and dark moments. Jackson lolls us into a false sense of comfort after we view a comical encounter with Susie and her Grandmother about the joy of first kisses, we are then brought sharply back to reality with Susie's narration reminding us that she will soon meet her demise at the hands of the terrifyingly creepy Mr Harvey, the quiet but psychologically disturbed neighbour from across the road.The film starts of light but soon turns into a tense, gritty thriller as the quest to discover what has happened to Susie begins. The scenes of Susie in the afterlife tend to derail the growing momentum of the investigation, as do some poorly executed sub plots. Susie's infatuation with Ray, a boy from school with which she has had but a few encounters, feels rather off note as she seems to spend more time moping for him in the afterlife than for her family. Susie's otherworldly contact with outcast Ruth also turns out to be highly frustrating as it builds expectation but accomplishes nothing in the way of bringing Susie's murderer to justice.One of the biggest faults in The Lovely Bones is poor character development, with Susie's parents suffering most. Their relationship seems false and their initial reaction to her death feels rather hastily passed over. The disintegration of their marriage barely registers in the film and we never really get a grip on who they are as characters, making it almost impossible to understand many of their actions, in particular Abigail's. The usually brilliant Rachel Weisz appears to be a blank canvas and doesn't seem to be fully present within her role. Mark Wahlberg fares a little better as the father obsessed with finding Susie's killer, but the holes within his character and thus performance are glaringly apparent. Whilst Rose McIver turns in a solid performance as Susie's younger sister Lindsay, the murder of her sibling appears to have no emotional effect on her character at all. Susan Sarandan in the role of Susie's unconventional, alcoholic Grandmother does well with the little she is given as some brief but pointless comic relief and Michael Imperioli fails to rise above his stereotypical, one note homicide detective.The two lead characters however manage to escape the fate of the supporting cast. Susie is possibly the most well rounded character in the film and Saoirse Ronan is brilliant in the role. One of the most talented actresses working today her work deserves to be recognised by the Academy as she manages to outshine the majority of performances given by actresses this year. The real show stealer however is masterclass character actor Stanley Tucci as the deranged serial killer Mr Harvey. Tucci's performance is so sinister and disturbing that it will haunt you for some time to come. It would be an absolute crime for Tucci to miss out on at least an Oscar nomination for his work as really he deserves to win.Despite it's faults The Lovely Bones still makes for one of the most original and compelling film experiences of the year. Completely haunting in every way, it is a great film that could or should have been magnificent.",The Lovely Bones
263,kels-errific,The unlovely Bones?,4,1 May 2010,"So asides from the jab with the summary title for this movie, I was seriously disappointed. Considering the subject matter, this movie was light and had some spotty acting. Nobody hear really elevates their resume, especially Susan Surandon who becomes the comic relief un-wittingly. I think the special effects overshadowed the dark subject matter, and the movie lacks a heart. Sure it has sappy moments, but they are contrived and lack the weight the subject matter carries. It feels pretty fluffy considering a young girl is murdered by an older creepy man. What I thought was going to be the movie of the decade did not even manage to be the movie of the day. *sad face A great story is behind this movie, unfortunately, this movie does not tell it. This movie lacks a soul and a movie about what happens with a family grieving for a lost one should have nothing but soul.",The Lovely Bones
264,danielepinat,Purgatory,8,29 December 2015,"Lovely bones. Let's admit it. A very strange film. Indeed, what is the framework on which the film is built on? What philosophy let it be religious or atheist impregnates it. A young girl is killed by a serial killer before she knows life and finds herself in purgatory watching over her family. The film itself is very poetic by the language used by the protagonist Susie Salmon (Saorise Ronan) which makes it a pleasant film to watch. However, the idea of purgatory as shown in the film: A bizarre one I could say. Yet, each artist let it be a writer, a painter, or other, all have an idea of what could constitute heaven, hell, purgatory, the garden of Eden, the soul, etc., and will describe it according to their view point. The movie does it very well, since the author Alice Sebold describes purgatory by how she sees it. The story is a basic one that of a ghost not at peace and stops herself from going probably to heaven until she accomplishes what she dreamt of that of knowing life (something similar to Ghost with Patrick Swayze) She takes over the body of Ruth and kisses Ray her last wish. The interesting thing about this movie is that while she watches over her family and the on going life of the characters is what normal people do as in this case if a child had been killed and the murderer not found, the parents would do everything to find the killer and with time go on with their lives with all of life's ups and downs. Again the movie shows it very well. In other words from purgatory she narrates what she sees: ''Nothing new under the tropics'' in terms of the story of a family in bereavement and how they deal with it. What constitutes the critical aspect of the movie is the idea of a ghost (Saorise Ronan) not at peace with herself until she takes over a body to know love for the first time. If this is what purgatory is to the author Alice Sebold then she succeeded to show her point of view: a new type of purgatory for young teenagers who will never know the joys of love. It could be for her a form of hell or an unexplainable sadness that we have yet to understand. That is what makes great artists: to be able to express a concept.",The Lovely Bones
265,t_kam,Ultimately disappointing,3,20 March 2020,"Rather late for my review considering the films age but just watched it on streaming. It had great potential but there were points that were excruciating in the way tension was ramped, moves that were so illogical such as when Lindsey is going through Harvey's sketch book. Once you've seen enough you just want to shout 'pick it up and run' but no she had to continue going through it. This gave Harvey the time to flee although how did he manage to move the safe on his own when it took two to tip it end over end later? He's now clearly a wanted man but he openly goes to the tip to get rid of the safe and nobody says anything. And that ending - it was such a let down. When a crime has been committed one desires justice and although Harvey gets his just reward through a stupid accident, justice has not been served. I'm left feeling annoyed.",The Lovely Bones
266,Larry-115,Good effort at extremely challenging adaptation,8,15 December 2010,"In navigating the torrent of negativity to which this movie has been subjected, one thing to keep in mind is that it's an adaptation of a very widely read and popular book.The book itself had a rather sunny disposition, which is ironic as it often was somewhat grislier in detail than the movie. That's because events can be described in words in a grisly way but still be part of an optimistic universe when you are reading -- it works. That doesn't quite happen when you actually see things with your eyes, film is much more literal (strange to say) that literature.Considering the subject matter, the murder of a young girl, it's a bit unfair to go to the movie and expect to see the book come to life on the screen.The problem in making the movie, as in any adaptation of magical realism concerning dark subjects, is how to capture the magic without having it jar too much with the realism. That was extremely difficult to do here considering how grim the subject is. So when Jackson uses special effects to invoke heaven, people tend to completely flip out, without really offering their own alternative about how that ""should"" have been done.All this adds up to a book that perhaps shouldn't have been adapted for the screen at all. That said, I think the movie is quite a fine one, especially because of the magnificent performances of the two leads, Ronan and Tucci. Thanks to the sweet-faced and deeply affecting Ronan, you'll never forget Susie Salmon. The music is also just fantastic, not surprising as Brian Eno did it -- it's very disappointing that the soundtrack is not available, as it's beautiful and haunting.I'd suggest seeing it and just let yourself decide if it's a worthwhile experience or not. I found it to be a very good try at adapting a book that by its nature is extremely hard to film. Actually the best way to go at it would be to watch the movie, then read the book, then try to figure out for yourself how you would have done it differently. I suspect that you'll gain a new appreciation for Jackson's movie if you do that.",The Lovely Bones
267,yngpsych,Why do so many people dislike this film?,9,2 January 2010,"When I first read this novel back in 2003, I was blown away yet never imagined a director being able to bring all the wonderful things contained within to the screen. But, in my humble opinion, Peter Jackson has done it. The acting is superb. His vision of the ""in between"" is magnificent. And the most intense scene in the novel taking place in the killers house that had me frantically tearing through the pages, had me on the edge of my seat in this filmed version. Sure, Jackson does not focus on the more violent and disturbing topics of the novel and stays away from any mention of rape or sex after death...but this movie worked for me despite these changes. So I recommend if you loved the book, see it with an open mind. This is just one mans vision of a novel that he obviously loved. Perhaps it is not perfect, but it is damned good!",The Lovely Bones
268,cannonclubonline,Seems to Have a Perfect Balance of Elements For Virtue Under Extreme Distress!,9,4 July 2010,"We see here in this film a culmination of many pathways of different experiences coming together for a truly superb film. This journey may only be compared to a cross between ""Stir of Echoes"" & ""What Dreams May Come"". Although the first person narrative may have been somewhat overdone at times, it was there to tell a story through the eyes & mind of a child who still had an innocence. It might be hard after years of living in this cruel world to all of a sudden start writing a screenplay with such innocence. We all to often want to start saying that it is unimaginable or way to sappy for anyone to have that sort of innocence at 14 years old. I find it even hard to believe knowing realistically how adolescents now actually think. Maybe Susie Salmon (Saoirse Ronan) lives a really sheltered life with no internet or much television back in 1973. Child molesters and serial killers weren't actually in the mainstream news back then.Irish born Saoirse Ronan makes the film work for everyone involved. Without her, the film would never have made such an impact. I wouldn't dare say that her acting skills were any more or less than any other performer, but being gifted at such a young age surely will make it much easier for her to land herself in other powerful and meaningful rolls in the future. Unfortunately she didn't land on the list for an Oscar.All the main players in this film delivered outstanding & believable performances. Taking special notice to Mark Wahlberg who plays the estranged father Jack Salmon. His acting skills have improved immensely since some of his other important films. Rachel Weisz was extremely convincing as a concerned & loving mother. Grandma Lynn (Susan Sarandon) was a bit distracting at times, but delivers a brake in tension with comedy, lending itself to a good release when things are sad. George Harvey (Stanley Tucci) was as creepy as they come. No one can say that Tucci can't act. He's probably the most versatile actors I've seen.What many have said about the film is that the computer graphics displaced the overall 1973 feel of the story-line. Most could argue that, to be a really memorable film, it has to be down to earth, and leave out all the complicated elements. Director Jackson may have alienated many people with the technology because that probably saw the polished glimmer of fantasy middle-life (Limbo) and began losing interest in the power of the story. The story is truly unforgettable, but might miss a mark or 2 with core elements by electroplating everything over with too much far-out visuals.Critics of film can be quite cruel and unforgiving when it comes to telling why certain things might have been responsible for ruining a film for them. I didn't really imagine what the film would have been like without the bells & whistles, since I connected the visual allusions to explanation (by Susie's narrative) to what I was viewing on the screen. I still felt as any protective father would; grieving, joyful, tense, thrilled, angry, heartbroken, vigilant, and blameful.The scene of Linsey Salmon (Rose McIver) breaking in Harvey's home was extremely suspenseful. Conflict resolution stages dealing with the discovery & the ending didn't quite work out for me, however, I can see why the surprise about what Susie's unfinished business really meant more to her than helping expose her killer.If you really make the effort to delve into this film, you will come out with a few tears rolling down you face.",The Lovely Bones

270,simmmz,How did this all go so wrong?,5,29 September 2010,"This is a heartbreaking film. Tragic in fact. Heartbreakingly tragic that a cast and crew, with such an excellent track record, could produce something so emotionally un-involving and unsatisfying. The prevailing sentiment as I walked out of 'The Lovely Bones' was disappointment.Adapting Alice Sebold's beloved novel was always going to be a colossal task. But the main problem with 'The Lovely Bones' is centralisation and focus. The film struggles with point of view, which isn't a huge surprise given the unique storyline. But I never foresaw such a big mess. Suzie is in heaven – we cut to the family...we cut back to Suzie......we follow the man who killed her...we hear her narration...we follow her friends aroundback to Suzie. It flips and changes, without ever settling to provide access into characters. Subsequently, there is nothing to grab onto and no emotional core.The scene in which Mr Harvey's victims confront Suzie in Heaven exemplifies this lack of grounding. There was emotive music, powerful visual imagery. It was overwrought clawing for emotion from the audience...but the victims of a serial killer had such little dramatic relevance, considering what had been presented before hand. It was a forced, manipulative moment. Therefore, I believe many aspects in this film would appeal to a younger audience, who have not yet developed the intellectual capacity to recognise something that has genuine emotional resonance, and something that has a superficial coating. And the studio appeared to have recognised this, changing their marketing strategy to hook in the 'Twilight' crowd.Additionally, what the film was trying to explore, remains elusive. At no point does the film confront grief, or attempt to deal with the complexities of grief...which isn't a problem in itself, but the final message of the film was how the process of dealing with death has strengthened bonds and created new ones. Whereas in the book this made sense, in the film, it is unjustifiable given the lack of exploration into character and relationships. I walked out of this confused as to what it was trying to achieve thematically.Peter Jackson's visionary 'heaven' was disappointing too. Although I don't expect subtlety from Jackson, it felt completely over the top and disconnected. This type of visual imagery has been done far more effectively in films like 'The Fountain' and 'Across The Universe'.The performances were a mixed bag. Saorsie Ronan's narration was poorly integrated. It was annoyingly over articulated, and provided more of a distraction than an enhancement (her actual acting scenes were outstanding though). And why bother hiring prolific actresses like Rachel Weisz and Susanne Sarandon, and then give them nothing to chew on? Sarandon's publicly expressed irritation in having her big scenes cut - completely understandable. Why focus on the characters of Ruth and Ray? That storyline went nowhere and the acting was awful. This belonged on the cutting room floor, not the intimate scenes between the Salmon Family. I just got the sense that the film was gutted in post-production.What is especially disappointing about 'The Lovely Bones' is the fact that there are still moments of brilliance. The early scenes involving Suzie's murder were powerful. The cinematography was perfect, and the soundtrack (by Brian Eno and John Hopkins) was really beautiful. These glimpses show 'what could have been'.As you can probably sense, I was not impressed with 'The Lovely Bones'. But I find it funny that Peter Jackson, and his team, made us care about a giant ape, Hobbits, and two murderess teenage girlsbut when it comes to a supernatural drama about death, he left most of us unstirred. There were so many errors of judgement in this botch job. With all the talent involved, I'm just left with the question, ""how did this all go so wrong""?",The Lovely Bones
271,michaelmunkvold,A terrible adaptation of a great book,4,18 October 2015,"With few exceptions, the book is better than the movie; most film adaptations of novels fall short when it comes to translating the author's voice and their characters onto the big screen. But I have seen few movies screw it up as badly as Peter Jackson's feeble adaptation of Alice Sebold's brilliant novel ""The Lovely Bones"". Jackson turns a story of grief, loss and rebirth into a clumsy blend of thriller and melodrama that substitutes special effects for real human feeling. In 1974, 14-year-old Susie Salmon (Saoirse Ronan) is murdered by her neighbor George Harvey (Stanley Tucci), a serial killer of young girls. She finds herself transported to her own personal Heaven, where she watches as her family is destroyed by grief and her murderer escapes justice. Susie's father Jack (Mark Wahlberg) becomes obsessed with entrapping Harvey, and her mother Abigail (Rachel Weisz) buries her pain by running away from her family. Meanwhile, Susie intervenes in the mortal sphere to help her loved ones move on.It sounds like a good story, right? Well, it is - as a novel. In Sebold's book, Susie's story is powerful, heart-wrenching stuff; as a film, it's shallow, uninspired and hokey. And there's one person to blame: director Peter Jackson. Sebold's lyrical, dynamic prose seems tailor made for film storytelling, but it would need the right director. Jackson isn't that director. Jackson's basic problem is that he misses the point of the material. Even though it has a fantastic premise, the novel is a small, intimate human drama. Jackson dumbs it down to a combination of police procedural and soap opera, and throws in lots of special effects to compensate. He makes everything big, bright and shiny - he turns Heaven into a big glowing Christmas tree ornament - but that's no substitute for what is lacking: a compelling story with real, relatable characters. Performances are hit-or-miss. Ronan is a talented actress, but here she's out of her depth. She fails to convey Susie's grief for the life she will never get to live; it doesn't even seem to register with her that she is, in fact, dead. Wahlberg and Weisz are believable as living through every parent's worst nightmare, but their characters are so thinly drawn (again, in sharp contrast to the vivid, multilayered ones in the novel) that it's hard to care much about them. Susan Sarandon is amusing as Susie's rambunctiously drunk grandmother, but she doesn't have much screen time. The only stand-out is Tucci, intensely creepy as the murderous pedophile Harvey. He actually made my skin crawl.""The Lovely Bones"" is a failure on almost every level, and marks the first major misstep of Jackson's career. He is a talented director, but he's the wrong one for a story like this. His gift is for creating bigger-than-life fantasy set pieces with Elves and Hobbits, not telling intimate stories about actual people. Real life - even the afterlife - just isn't his thing.",The Lovely Bones
272,lenoreadler1991,Greatest movie ever made,10,3 February 2021,The Lovely Bones covers the rather depressing issue of a child murder. A recently murdered schoolgirl tells the story from purgatory of her death and how it affected her family.This is an unusual story and one that is difficult to film but I think that Peter Jackson pulls it off in fine style. There is an air of dread as the film builds up to Susie's untimely death. The scene of her death is brilliantly handled but very disturbing. The images of purgatory are also brilliantly realised to my mind. It covers well the emotions felt by the family at losing their daughter in such a horrific way.There are outstanding performances from both Saoirse Ronan as Susie Salmon and from a chillingly creepy Stanley Tucci as the killer. Good support is given by Mark Wahlberg and Susan Sarandon.The only slight downside to me was the ending which I find a bit unsatisfactory but this doesn't take away from what has gone before.This is a superb fantasy drama which to my mind is underrated probably because of it's themes rather than it's quality. Highly recommended.,The Lovely Bones
273,sorearm,A Beauty,10,21 August 2017,"I watched The Lovely Bones for the second time last night. The first time I saw it was a few years ago and I remember my internal, one-liner review from then: Peter Jackson, (I can't stand LOTR films) you've found the right subject matter to showcase your visual talent. This time around, maybe I'm getting soft, but how gripping this film is from start to finish. Many films you can easily take a break from or let your mind drift but I found this film totally captivating, to the point where I felt some sort of connection between it's mood and vague emotions from my own childhood.The music was also excellent, the early pieces particularly. I was noticing the later pieces were not as good but then the part where Tim Buckley's Song To The Siren, covered by This Mortal Coil came on and I was an indoor sprinkler. By the way, I'm a bloke; football fan, steak & chips etc etc. However, I love this film because it's essence is the girl's experience, so it seems hopeful and pure. So many films depicting murder, particularly of a young person follow the arc of grief and sadness with an eventual glimmer of hope or justice. This film was told from the perspective of the girl, and death was not the end so just for that The Lovely Bones is a revelation.",The Lovely Bones

Whatever the case is, I thoroughly enjoyed The Lovely Bones and it was quite an emotional story.

278,falconer99,Two films for the price of none,5,15 February 2010,"Well, firstly I didn't think the film was that bad, and, no, I haven't read the book yet.I am sure the book is better (isn't it always), but even the (apparently) pared-down version failed in what it was advertised as trying to achieve.We were meant to see Susie's reaction to finding herself dead and how she helps those back on earth to find her killer.But there is hardly any interaction between Susie and her family after her death. The only evidence I saw was how she influenced her father to try and attack Stanley Tucci's character, which scene did not fit in well with the characters nor the film.In fact what we were watching appeared to be two separate films interlaced: in one, we have a travelogue documentary about one's travels after one is dead, and, in the other, we see how a grief-stricken family deals with the unthinkable.The police work is a bolt-on necessity, and nothing more, and nobody even has the closure (what an awful word) of knowing what happened to the murderer (the audience do though, and apparently, the extra scene where Tucci's character graphically – and noisily - falls down the cliff at the end was only added to satisfy public feeling).Also, on a few occasions, you can see the way the film is going, and then it veers off in another direction. Examples are when Susie's sister finds the book and then delays in handing it over, or when, despite finally knowing who the murderer is, the Police seem incapable of finding and apprehending him, or when Susie appears to be about to stop the safe being dumped at the end of the film, but doesn't seem to care. OK, having a film that surprises one is fine, but not when it seems unlikely or wrong.So, the film might have been better-received had it not largely changed the book, not been overlong for its content, and been more true to its announced story-line.As it is, it's two fairly interesting films that could have been one superb film.",The Lovely Bones

Im going to answer some questions I'm sure some of you are dying to know the answer to.Does Peter Jackson go a little heavy on the CGI? Yes, yes he does, but what do expect when its Peter Jackson filming a dream like state give the guy a break.Does Mark Wahlberg phone it in as usual? Surprisingly no, his role as a father trying to cope with the lost of his daughter is performed wonderfully. Personally I think this his best showing since Boogie Nights.How does old Pete do with the scenes, not involving special effects? A lot better then one would expect, the story gets choppy in some spots and there are also scenes and characters that are just plain unnecessary, its sort of like Unforgiven in the way it sometimes takes a rest stop at some unnecessary junctions, and frankly i can think of about 20 minutes of footage that could be cut from this film, which is the main reason its probably so harshly frowned upon by mainstream critics.Who is the best actor in the movie? Without a doubt Saoirse Ronan she actually makes a lot of the other actors look stale in comparison, she is just so alive in every scene and is in my opinion the best actor under 18 hell probably under 23 in the world today.Wat are the movies main downfalls? Peter Jackson seems lost some times, and this kind of movie is a stretch for the poor guy, so yes the direction is shoddy but far from the massacre people are making it out to be. Also Rachel Weisz phoned it in for the most part, i mean god help her she tries but at the end of the day she just doesn't cut it, also even though she did great in her role Susan Sarandon's character is border line unnecessary, as well as the aforementioned 20 minutes of scenes that seem to be useless filler at best.So why did you give it an 8/10 again? Easy it does what it sets out to do and does it beautifully sure there is this and that one could nit pick about, but at the end of the day all the pieces fall into place to tell a great story that explores the depths of every aspect of mankind from the innocent, to the mad, to the confused, to the evil its all here, and even though it might not be flawlessly executed it sure as hell is pretty captivating.Thanks for reading, Ed.",The Lovely Bones
280,jeannel2003-618-511281,"The Book Was Hot, The Movie Is Rot",1,29 April 2010,"Some books are meant to be left in that medium and not be mucked up by trying to force them into movie form. I suppose producers, et al, who commit such an act are protected by The First Amendment, but, gee, there oughta be a law! Alice Sebold's, ""The Lovely Bones,"" is such a book. This achingly, bittersweet story of a young girl's murder and afterlife is made gripping by the murder mystery and the heartbreaking plight of the family left behind contained therein. Perhaps there is someone out there who has just the right touch to perform the miracle of transforming this unique and creative novel into a unique and creative movie, but it was not Peter Jackson. Despite the excellent (and wasted) cast, after the opening that attempts to set up the plot, the movie is alternately confusing, annoying, tedious and pedestrian.When an author is describing something as elusive as heaven, each reader imagines it to his own satisfaction. To leave that job to one person -- in this case, Jackson -- can be disastrous. What a shock for those of us who enjoyed Sebold's book to see a Candyland version of heaven, for example. Or to see what amounts to a magic trick when a flower rapidly opens in Susie's father's hand while Susie is touching one just like it in her mystical state. Feh! Alice Sebold showed her readers a possibility in the wake of unbearable loss, a concept and description that could be absorbed slowly in the privacy and quiet of one's own mind. Peter Jackson shows just another disturbing comic book twist on murder and mysticism, which is light years away from the sweet, delicate touch Sebold uses in her book.To reiterate, some books should remain books. I cannot even recommend this movie as a cheap thriller to pass the time. It's just plain disturbing, on many fronts.",The Lovely Bones
281,Vash_ebas,A Huge disappointment,3,8 December 2010,"I read the book 'The lovely bones' by Alice Sebold and loved it. I could not put it down. So I wanted to see the movie, and it was a huge disappointment. It is difficult to catch the subtleties and details of a novel in a visual medium like a movie, but Peter Jackson could have done a better job of the adaptation. Instead of focusing on how Suzie's feelings evolved while she was in the in between place, after her murder, he resorted to inordinate amounts of special effects. The CGI worked well in Lord of the rings and Kingkong, but this movie needed a different kind of handling, with CGI being used only where essential. The special effects in this movie are overpowering and they eclipse the movie. The biggest disappointment for me was that movie was a downer, which was quite a contrast with the book which is surprisingly humorous and uplifting.The screenplay took too many liberties with the book which spans 8 to 10 years, to make it fit in a two hour movie. It is understandable that some changes would be unavoidable, but it is important to stay faithful to the main story. This movie is not. It missed the main point of the book. Suzie in her in between world was watching her family, and growing with them, feeling happy or sad with them, until she arrived at a realization, and so did her family and friends- to move on. This happens over an 8 to 10 year period.The characters in the movie are dull and undeveloped, in contrast with the vibrant ones in the book. Saoirse Ronan is a good child actor, but in this movie she was severely limited by the badly written screenplay. The movie does nothing to explain how she came to the realization that she and her family had both moved on with their respective lives, that revenge and forgiveness were both irrelevant at that point. It is still satisfying to the viewer and the reader in the end that the horrible Mr.Harvey did die. Stanley Tucci was the only bright spot where acting was concerned. His acting surpassed all the other actors.Grandma Lynn (Susan Sarandon) appears early in the movie and does not really help the weak screenplay. Rachel Weisz would have had a lot of scope for acting out her grief if the movie had stuck with the book, instead of rushing her out to the wine country of California and making it look like she had been away for just a few months.Mark Wahlberg as the grieving father is just adequate. I believe the weak screenplay limited both him and Rachel Weisz. Sarandon was not really needed for the grandma role. Almost any actres would have been enough; there was no scope for acting, and whatever Sarandon did, did not help.The relationship between Lindsey and Samuel is a very sweet part of the book and it's throughout the book. It's almost like Susie lives her own dreams of love through them. Instead, Samuel is almost completely absent except for two very brief scenes, and a great opportunity was lost. Toward the end (in the book) Suzie uses Ruth's body to make love to Ray- this was a gift she had received for a few hours, and she had no choice but to leave when her time was up. Instead, the movie makes it look like it was her last wish to kiss Ray before moving on to heaven, and it was something that she willed. That was a grave injustice to the book.The scenes of the 'small heaven' are too much CGI, and not enough soul. That is the problem with this movie. It lacks the soul that the book has, and it is just a gimmicky movie with a lot of special effects. I had expected better work from Peter Jackson, but may be he is a good director for big budget films with lots of special effects, but not for subtle films. The movie does not really 'get it' what the book is trying to convey, and the message is lost.In summary the only positive about this movie is Stanley Tucci's acting. The rest is better forgotten. Read the book instead.",The Lovely Bones
282,slimfan,A Lovely Film,7,6 January 2010,"Saoirse Ronan is terrific and her Susie Salmon is worth the price of admission. Even though we've all seen the spots and trailers and know Susie is murdered, I still found myself hoping against hope that she would somehow get away. Alas... Mark Wahlberg is miscast in every film, so if you can tolerate him, you will enjoy this film. I was very fortunate to attend a special screening that featured a Q&A with Peter Jackson, Stanley Tucci and Susan Sarandon, and it was obvious that the film means something to them, especially Peter Jackson. Yes, there are a lot of special effects and CG to illustrate Susie's afterlife, but honestly, how else would you do it? Anyone? I thought not. There are a lot of Peter Jackson haters posting reviews here, and to them I say, ""Show me your film!"" I haven't read the book - don't plan to either - but Alice Sebold was happy with the film version, so that's good enough for me. I expect Saoirse Ronan will have a very successful career - lovely, talented girl.",The Lovely Bones
283,olihist,"Good Effort, But A Difficult Adaptation",8,17 January 2010,"Death is a very difficult subject to treat honestly in any media, let alone film, and ""Lovely Bones"" seems to be no exception to this rule. I have not read Alice Seibold's novel so I will not comment on how well Peter Jackson's adapted her story. That said, I thought the film did a nice job in portraying the grief and emotions surrounding the violent loss of a loved one. In terms of acting, visuals, and overall story, ""Lovely Bones"" compares well with ""What Dreams May Come,"" another moving film on death. There were some elements of this film, however (e.g. conclusion, supporting characters), that seemed rushed or disjointed. Adapting a complex book is never an easy task, although director Peter Jackson should have considerable experience with such a task from his ""Lord of the Rings"" films. Still, many of the harsh reviews that I've read from critics and moviegoers seem more directed towards Peter Jackson than the actual merits of this film.Overall, I would give ""Lovely Bones"" an above average rating of 8 out of 10.",The Lovely Bones
284,leishayoung,A wonderful tribute to those who have lost loved ones to tragedy and without closure.,8,18 June 2019,"This is a film that asks us to suspend our 'logical minds' and find solace in humanity, both in the living and the dead.For the religious, this film will be wonderfully cathartic, for everyone else, it will require an open mind and a desire to find humanity in tragic death, and an understanding of the unimaginable pain people suffer when there is no closure for their loss, and no place to assign their pain and grief.The protagonist speaks to us from beyond the grave to take us on the journey of, not just a family coming to grips with their unexplained, tragic and immense loss, but of the spirit who must also find her own way to freedom from the pain of her death, and the loss of her family in any tangible sense.This truly is a film that requires the suspension of reality and the embracing of purely visceral understandings and experiences of intense love, loss, pain and ultimately 'personal' redemption, for the human and spirit world alike.This film is adapted from a novel, and novel adaptations are notoriously difficult, as film makers must find the visual equivalent of, sometimes, pages of literary prose/poetry.Of course Jackson is the master of this kind of interpretation and he delivers a very well acted, emotive and ascetically pleasing film. However, as is often the case with novel adaptations, the film suffers with too much disjointed and, somewhat, clumsy narrative structure, as such it feels as though you are jumping between several different genres in the one film and never really landing on anything that feels solid.Add to this the excessive run time and it does start to feel as though Jackson tried to fit too much into one film. That is, focusing too much on encapsulating every element of the original text and not enough time focusing on the 'visual' experience of the film.Regardless, this is a film that ultimately seeks to bring the experience of tragic and painful death to life both through the living and the dead, and it succeeds admirably.I highly recommend this film for the 'open minded'.",The Lovely Bones
285,NukeHollywood,Potentionally great film brought down by cutesyness and racism,5,4 May 2019,"I like Peter Jackson's style of film making and the astral realm scenes were ... out of this world. That's part of what really made the film.Actors ... were not annoying, and that I consider a credit in this day.They did go overboard with the eternally smiling Susie Salmon, and the romance rubbish. Jackson found a way to even extend the movie for awhile after it needed to end. He manages to do LOTR style multiple endings here too.The worst thing here was the over the top racist presentation of the 30 something woman as a teenage girl in pigtails ... as a naive sidekick to Susie. Her whole presence and dialogues come from the mind of an idiotic racist who can only see Asian women as subservient furniture in the lives of white women. Her lines were truly dumb and insulting.You can blame Peter Jackson for this as director and one of the screenplay writers. He continues his record of having not a single non-white person in LOTR but managing stereotypes when he does have them. He probably never got out of New Zealand much.",The Lovely Bones
286,jeffjett11,very good movie,10,20 January 2010,"one of the few movies of 2010 that i paid to see, and I'm glad i did first thing- when i see movies or TV shows that are about life in the 70sthat are poor depictions of that era it makes me sick- there are so many details left out.. but this movie was very detailed- ash trays mounted on the wall, in the shopping mall, or the kid browsing albums, and the pit for garbage. the cars were also a reminder of that period. and these small details i notice, and it makes me think of that time.second, Mark Wahlberg did a great job with his role, he is a very good actor.his part,a 70s dad, i left the theater thinking he was a 70s dad. and the girl, Saoirse Ronan also did a great job as the main character, he expressions of innocence were also a reminder of that era. i think we will see more of her in future films. last thing, the story:i think the story was very well told, shows us all that creeps were,and still are among us. the victim's spirit after the crime,is sad in a way because -life lost she was so young, and that what's sad, she was innocent.and how the killer dies,shows how things work in the universe, but if when this comes out on DVD I'll bet there is an alternate ending where the killer dies in another manner, i could think of a few different ways to end this, but i'm not a writer. and mostly i felt through this movie, ""boy i hope this guy gets his""a part where i did bite my nails, was when she was in the killers underground layer, i was hoping so much that she would get away.another part that i bit my nails down more, was when the sister broke into his house, i really thought she was the next victim.i didn't read anything about this movie, nor did i know what the story was about until i entered the theater. maybe that is why i thought it was such a good movie.the only thing i thought could of been left out or changed was that musical interlude, showing life in the house like the grandmother doing the wash and he just being herself, set to a soundtrack from the 70s, i thought the director could of used music in a different way to remind us that we were in the 70s. this interlude almost took away the sadness of the girl losing her life. and for a moment made the film less serious.this movie is worth paying to see.",The Lovely Bones

He was unrecognizable in appearance and character as the murderous neighbor. Without speaking, he could give anyone the creeps. I love to see an actor disappear into a role and he certainly did. Mark and Rachel did not overplay the roles of suffering parents. And Susan Sarandon was superb as the alcoholic, honest and funny grandmother. The casting for Susie, Lindsey and Ray was sweet and perfect.The book was far superior to the movie. The heaven scenes ran on too long and did not add to the movie. Susie's ability to watch and comment on the scenes on earth was good. But not much else about her heaven was interesting. Loved the ending. So now, all is well with the world.",The Lovely Bones
288,5h4d0w,from bad taste to the lovely bones (or 'look at me!!'),6,2 January 2010,"i've seen almost every feature film made by peter jackson. and i was very excited when the lovely bones was announced because while i liked lord of the rings quite a bit, i still feel more drawn to his horror movies. also, while i didn't find heavenly creatures as extraordinary as many, i rated it 8/10 and i hoped that with his experience from LotR and the horror-mix, the lovely bones might be able to get beyond that and into the area of movies that manage to deeply affect me.unfortunately, the film felt like a step back even from heavenly creatures to me. i remember that the latter felt pretty slow and the same goes for lovely bones. but in addition it also has a couple of additional annoyances. one of the major ones i've mentioned in the title of this review. ""look at me!!"" is a reoccurring (very often at that) phrase in the movie and not only does it get very annoying after about the third time, cynics might say it can also be understood as a wink to the visual effects of the movie - LOOK AT ME!!it's funny - with lord of the rings, people never understood why i didn't like the visual effects. i felt there were too few that really stood out. with the lovely bones, i feel like it's exactly the opposite. there are many effects that stand out a lot which in itself would not be bad (i loved that about e.g. what dreams may come) but here it often feels like it serves no purpose. more like a cg demonstration. which can get pretty boring and even annoying if you're excited about the movie's story and you realize that the pictures you see do nothing but drag out the continuation of it.a very surprising thing about the visual side of the film was that it was sluggish in some respects. i wouldn't have expected that from jackson and certainly not considering the budget. there are plenty of elements that look out of place, lighting that seems so wrong and so on. and most surprisingly - some shots (all of them macro) look like they were shot using a cheap video camera, those are the shots that felt the most distracting to me.one aspect i had mixed feelings about was the score. at times, it reminded me of eternal sunshine of the spotless mind, at times of lord of the rings - which both is a good thing - and then there were parts where the music was screeching like in some blockbuster action-thriller. LOOK AT ME!! there's tension, we get it. oh and in regards to blockbuster elements... there are also a couple of blockbusterish, needless flashbacks in there. LO... you get my point.i did enjoy the story though, i have a soft spot for these mystical kind of movies and while i didn't like a lot of the effects, i appreciate that somebody besides tarsem (even though i love his movies, there simply are only two) tries to use a lot of surreal imagery in a feature film.but considering the budget this movie had, it's a huge disappointment to me. i actually would've thought that it was done for about 10-20 mio., until i took a look at the budget information. a disgrace especially in these economic times (it would've been another story if the effects looked adequate for the budget and they would've made sense for the story) which IMO should not be supported. if you want to watch a mystical movie about the afterlife and you don't know it yet, i'd recommend what dreams may come instead. and if you have a thirst for surreal imagery, try the cell or the fall.",The Lovely Bones
289,waterwalker,"Thoughtful, spiritual and visually beautiful film",7,9 January 2010,"I saw this tonight in spite of the negative reviews that have been pouring out on various forums.Scratching my head to try and understand the vituperation against this movie, which seems to be for two main reasons: 1) Peter Jackson chose not to include the rape scene on screen.2) Apparently there was too much CGI used to convey Susie's spiritual experience of the 'in between'.Before I go further I'll make it quite clear that I feel this is neither a perfect film nor Jackson's best work. It's obvious Mark Wahlberg's part has been edited down and I can't help wishing Gosling had been able to stay on in the role of the father. He would have brought an emotional depth to the role which Wahlberg lacks. However, in the scenes that were included I didn't have a major issue with Wahlberg's performance. The rest of the cast were very good, except for the girl who played Holly who was not a particularly good actor.People claim that Jackson has dishonored Sebold's novel by choosing not to show Susie's violation and death explicitly on screen. I think the opposite. Jackson has understood that whatever he tried to film would be inadequate to convey the horror of such an intensely personal violation. Those who have read Sebold's novel will no doubt remember that while she makes it clear what has happened--most of it is expressed by suggestion and metaphor rather than blow by blow descriptions. Jackson, in my view, rightly felt not only that we do not need to see blow by blow details but was perhaps concerned that from a victim's point of view it might actually be disrespectful to try and do so? I'm not trying to speak for anyone, just batting around ideas.As for too much CGI; for me this was not an issue at all. Jackson has a terrific visual imagination and this greatly enhanced and helped to convey Susie's struggle to come to terms with what had happened.Perhaps Jackson's purposes in making this film simply did not match the majority of viewers' expectations. However, even when his movies don't totally work, for me they are never boring.",The Lovely Bones
290,Screaming_egg,NOT a thriller - Watch only if you are into dramas,1,13 June 2019,This movie is NOT a thriller. It's an emotional boring drama. Full of nonsense scenes & unexplained wanna-be deep dialogues.Don't watch unless you are into these things.,The Lovely Bones
291,Ely-girl,The Lovely Bones,7,8 August 2010,"I usually have no problem reviewing movies, but I find the ""Lovely Bones"" a very difficult movie to review. I'm sure everyone is familiar with the story-line: the movie focuses on young 14 year old Susie Salmon who has a passion for photography but who is later raped and killed by the sadistic Mr. Havery, a man who lives in her neighborhood. When Susie is killed, she goes on to watch her family from her ""Heaven"". I would not usually watch movies of this genre, but the book (by Alice Sebold) and fantastic visual affects pulled me in straight away. The first-half of the movie is absolutely brilliant and many pivotal scenes (and dialogue) from the book are kept in i.e. when Susie drives her ""sick"" brother to the hospital. We are introduced to several main characters (Ruth, Ray etc) and are able to see Susie grow up, thus making her murder more difficult to sit through (though nothing is actually shown). Pardon my expression but I was biting my fingernails on several occasions and quite literally, on the edge of my seat, especially when Lindsey Salmon breaks into and escapes the murderer's house! The graphic details, although not shown, are still very dark and disturbing and the movie is overall, very difficult to sit through, though this does not mean it is not entertaining. As many reviewers have already pointed out, I felt at times, the movie focused its valuable time far too much on the visual-affects (in ""Susie's Heaven"") rather than the story or in this scenario, character development. For example, I did not feel we knew enough about Buckley (Susie's younger brother), who plays a pivotal role in the book, while Ruth's character is sadly not explored at all. Other characters featured in the book are also missing.On the bright side, the CGI/visual affects are very beautiful to look at and with it's bittersweet humour and ability to play at your heart-strings like a fiddle, this makes this movie well-worth watching. Many of the scenes in the book are in here, although for somebody who has not yet read it, it may be a little confusing. Saoirise Ronan (as Susie Salmon), is absolutely faultless, as are many of the other actors/actresses in this movie. To sum it up, I think the ""Lovely Bones"" is a very entertaining movie. It's not the best movie I've seen but it's certainly not the worst either. I would agree with other reviewers when I say the ""Lovely Bones"" focuses more on the imagery than anything else, thus earning a 7/10 rating from me. Give it a go but be prepared to lower your expectations.",The Lovely Bones

Maybe my expectations were a bit off, but had the movie been more about suspense with a thriller element rather then the after-life drama it was, i would have liked it i think. The emotional angle in this movie should have been a tool to feed the suspense surrounding the killer and the father trying to find him and whether or not his other daughter would been the next/last victim. But to my great disappointment that never happened. If i had known the movie would have mostly been about drama and surreal after-life cgi rather then finding a good balance between this and the suspense, i would have stopped watching after 20 minutes.",The Lovely Bones
293,shanebeacham,I Think Some People Need To Watch This As A Film And Not As An Adaptation,7,18 June 2010,"Thanks for checking out my review for The Lovely Bones starring Saoirse Ronan, Mark Wahlberg, Rachel Weisz and Stanley Tucci. Now the basic premise follows Susie Salmon, like the fish, who is raped and murdered by her neighbor from across the street. Once dead she is caught in the ""In Between"" which is the middle between Earth and Heaven. There, she watches over her family and see how they are dealing with the situation, and she watches over her killer and seeing who his next victim may be.I was looking forward to seeing The Lovely Bones once the trailers started coming out. I have never read the book, and I believe that no matter what how good the material is, a film should stand on its own. Once the reviews started coming out, I wasn't so sure about what was gonna happen. But a lot of the reviews have been concerning the adaptation in comparison to the book. And because I didn't read the book, I loved the movie.On the good side, the cast were easily the best part of this movie. My two favorites in this movie were Stanley Tucci and Saoirse Ronan. Ronan is the soul of this film. She pushes it along and makes us care for her, cry for her, afraid for her. Stanley Tucci is incredible and is just creepy in this film. He makes you scared of him and just hate him. Mark Wahlberg is great as well as Rachel Weisz, which leads into my next praise for the film.A lot of the emotion comes from the scenes where the characters are grieving the loss of Susie. When that happens, Mark Wahlberg is at his best, and Rachel Weisz is at her best.A lot of the reviews have pointed out how the film is more about the visual effects than the story. I feel more that the visuals help tell the story. The scenes in the In Between are the best parts visually. It makes you feel like you're in Susie's head.The film's message about moving on after a terrible loss is used so well in the film. And this will affect some more than others depending on if you've been in that situation.Having said all that, basically calling this movie a lovely film (no pun intended), it does have some things wrong with it. There were some times where the film felt a little bit too melodramatic. It was only about 2 or 3 times, but they were definitely noticeable.Also, Susan Sarandon, while not bad, was the weakest role in the film. She's basically supposed to be a bit of comic relief in the film, and sometimes it worked because you think, ""Oh, that's just how she would act in this situation, trying to bring the family back together."" And then there are times where it just feels a little too silly. It didn't ruin the film, but it kinda went a little overboard in some bits.The music they use doesn't work. Not the score per Se, but the scene where they use source music, and I get what they're doing: They're trying to bring us back to the seventies. But there are times where it just doesn't work at all. Like the scene in the beginning where Susie is rushing her brother to the hospital; it's supposed to be a serious scene, but the music is played like it's meant to be ""The Lovely Bones: Comedy Hour"" and she's trying not to get hit while the music is playing.Fortunately, the good outweighs the bad and in the end, I loved The Lovely Bones. It was a beautifully made film, directed well, and while not Peter Jackson's best film, it was still a wonderful movie. If you're a fan of the book, maybe skip this one, but if you are like me and you didn't read it, get it on DVD.I give The Lovely Bones an 8.5/10.",The Lovely Bones
294,juiceman10712,I loved (parts of) it.,6,26 April 2010,"Let my start by saying I have not read the book.The first time I 'saw' the film I had only caught the last 30 minutes or so, Which I thought were fantastic and I was stunned because I had heard so many bad things. SO to see for myself, I re watched the whole film shortly afterwards... and my opinion changed a bit. It's not as awful as most will have you believe but it's not without its problems.The plot is fairly simple. A young girl named Susie is raped and murder by her serial killer neighbour and then proceeds to watch over her killer, family, etc. from a sort of limbo/heaven.The film fails where most Novel adaptations fail. Everything feels rushed and underdeveloped. Despite some great performances by Stanley Tucci and Saoirse Ronan most characters feel pretty two dimensional. Sme characters are so underused and underdeveloped that it feels as if they were only kept because they were an integral part of the storyline but the majority of their stories have been removed. This makes character actions and reactions somewhat unjustified and unclear from the audience's perspective.Susie's story is a little weak and it's fairly unclear what she is doing in the limbo type area, and what exactly she has to accomplish. Many people complain that these scenes are overdone and Jackson went to CGI happy with them. Well I agree to some extent because if so much effort was put into making everything look so fantastical, why couldn't the same amount of effort be applied in making a tight, cohesive narrative? All aside these scenes ARE beautiful and are one of the strong points in the film.Despite the film's faults, it still managed to snare me emotionally which means it's doing SOMETHING right. I did get the gist of everything even though the film left me scratching my head a lot and wanting to know more.Overall there was just something about the film I really enjoyed. It was touching and sweet but also tragic and heartbreaking. It's artistic and stylish with beautiful visuals in and outside of heaven.It's a shame that everything else in the film feels so weak because this could have been a truly great film.",The Lovely Bones
295,paulnm96,The Stalker,8,29 May 2011,This movie describes how a 14 year old girl is stalked and killed by her neighbor.Susie Salmon (Saoirse Ronan) takes a short-cut home from school one 6th of December 1973 but this time she meets her 38-year old neighbor George Harvey (Stanley Tucci). He shows her an underground place that he claims for teenagers but he actually takes Susie down there in which he hopes to rape her she persist and therefore he kills her.Susie has a huge amount of hatred for Harvey but also trys to help her father Jack (Mark Wahlberg) find out who the killer is. Harvey spends much of the movie after the killings acting casual as though he did nothing and no one suspects him. Just about a year after the killings Harvey's attention turns to Susie's little sister Lindsey (Rose McIver) Jack suddenly realizes who the killer is.Will Harvey successfully complete another murder of a teenager or will Jack and his family be able to stop or kill Harvey. The hatred for Harvey by the whole audience grows through-out the movie. A very sad and heartbreaking story 'The Lovely Bones' is an epic masterpiece.,The Lovely Bones

297,smiley_pat77,"I was in my own ""In-between""",4,17 July 2010,"Before seeing ""The Lovely Bones"", I thought that, perhaps, all the negative reviews were a result of misunderstood subject matter. Maybe it was too original for people. Maybe it didn't resemble any of the conventions they anticipated it to and so they simply rebelled against wrapping their mind around it. And then I saw the movie and realized there is nothing to be misunderstood when you simply can't understand the film in the first place.I've become accustomed to long movies from Peter Jackson, but at a mere 2 hours and 15 minutes the Subjective Time in this one is by far the longest. The movie is poorly structured without any sort of discernible arch... or at least one that I cared about. It's like the whole thing is cut up into sequences and scenes that were assembled apart from the whole and then strung together by a few very weak threads. The shifts and switchbacks are jarring and untamed. I read the book and I don't know if I could tell you what this movie is about. I found myself in my own ""In-between"" as I tried to decide whether it was worth trying to enjoy or should I just give up.Part of the brilliance of ""King Kong"" (2005) was that it was a massive film that was given a level tenderness. It took its time. Everything could be absorbed appropriately and the emotions ran high. Jackson, however, takes a major step backwards as ""The Lovely Bones"" seems to have been treated as if it was established as a tender story and he desired to make it massive. It's excessively stylized and over-dramatized for something with the level of tragedy and humanity it's suppose to have. None of the emotions that it wanted me to attain were earned.For a character-driven story, the characters have very little presence. This is a family tragedy without the family. There is no sense of the supposed coping that happens. This should have been about a family's journey towards a world without one of their own and the connections that result. There should have been despair and heart ache over the life the characters longed for and wanted but were denied at no fault of their own. Instead I ached for the movie I longed for but was denied at the fault of the filmmakers.I will forever believe this is a story that could make a great film. In this case, it didn't happen. Nowhere close, even if it does have good singular moments. I will stand for the visuals in this film. The effects are good and the cinematography rather splendid but it's annoyingly edited. Much of the imagery is beautiful. The opening scenes play out effectively enough for the most part, particularly when Susie realizes what's happened to her as she sees her murderer in a bathtub with her own blood everywhere. Maybe I'm just thankful that the scene took place while I could still digest what was happening.Unfortunately by the time Susie's sister, Lindsey, breaks into the killer's lair, a scene that on its own achieves a desired level of suspense, things were just too awry and I had simply stopped caring at a point about 45 minutes sooner. Alternatively, I listened to the rumbling of ""Avatar"" playing in the adjacent theatre, wishing that I had instead chosen to see it for a 4th viewing.",The Lovely Bones

The film started interestingly enough and we thought we were in for a film similar to Stir of Echoes which we all enjoyed. Up to the point where the girl was murdered, it then declines into what I can only describe as a 60's pop video on acid. The story stays there just barely but when reading about the film I expected the girl to give clues to help her family find her killer. She didn't but was quite happy prancing around with Lucy and the sky with Diamonds.

301,gregyolen,Beware THE LOVELY BONES!,2,28 February 2010,"Between the sixteen endings of RETURN OF THE KING, and the 790-minute Empire State Building climax of KING KONG, it's fair to say that extended death scenes have become Peter Jackson's forté. I'm a sucker for his KONG – but the scene of Susie Salmon's abduction and murder is hard to classify as entertainment. And yet THE LOVELY BONES is not a bad film because of objectionable subject matter. It is a bad film because it's the sum of uniformly bad artistic choices: The cinematography is a sloppy muddle, with cameras moving when they needn't and shouldn't, especially in domestic scenes. Sequences like the killer's introduction, peering through the windows of a dollhouse, are over-edited, where a simpler, cleaner presentation would do better. The musical score by Brian Eno is off the mark in almost every moment – most criminally, a 70's fabulous disco in heaven, set not to K.C. and the Sunshine Band, but to classical strings (AS BAD AS IT SOUNDS.) Worse still is Susie Salmon's ceaseless voice over. The post-mortem narrator's been done before, but it's hard to think of a more miscalculated application than this. Though Penn & Teller urge us to politely golf clap whenever the title of a film is worked into its dialogue, when Susie announces, apropos to nothing at film's end, ""these are the lovely bones"" and then attempts to briefly unpack that statement, the only possible response is to groan – not clap.READ MY FULL REVIEW (AND MORE) AT STEVENSPIELBLOG.COM -Greg",The Lovely Bones

The whole film was developing really slowly, I never felt that family was a ""real"" family. The chemistry was 0. The acting from everybody seemed really wooden. They spent a totally unnecessary load of money on special effects. How could this movie cost $100 million? Definitely the CG. Here, there, everywhere. Unneeded, unnecessary. Cliché, saw it 100 times already. The whole story just fell apart... I wasn't really caring for anyone. And the end... was baaad. You waiting for sg... and then it just didn't happen.Mr. Jackson please please don't become the next one hit wonder George Lucas. It is time to make a good film again...",The Lovely Bones
303,sterrekooi,"Disappointing, but not that bad",6,10 April 2010,"I was really looking forward to seeing The Lovely Bones. It's almost out of theaters already over here, so I took my chance yesterday and went to see it. And unfortunately, it was quite of a disappointment.There are several things about this film which are very good and several things which are very bad.The ending, where Ray and Susie kiss (when Susie is actually Ruth), was really showing some sort of ""we-hadn't-had-a-kiss-in-the-film-yet-so- now-we-just-put-it-in-the-end""-air. Though sweet, it was totally unnecessary and it kind of ruined the end for me. Another thing that annoyed me was, though sometimes very beautiful, the sudden shots of heaven, which sometimes seemed to add nothing to the story. We see a shot of Susie's parents and then suddenly we see her running in slow-motion through some white, undefined space. It sometimes made me feel like I was watching a videoclip.Nevertheless, the acting in The Lovely Bones is quite good. Very good actually. Stanley Tucci deserves a huge praise for this. He was so nice in The Devil Wears Prada, and in this movie, he actually IS a villain. The viewer seems to be able to take a really good look inside the mind of a child killer. Everything is right about his acting; his timing, his looks, his nasty chuckling. The scene in which he is in the ""cellar"" with Susie under the cornfield is intense, and really, really scary. All good for Stanley, he proves himself to be an amazing actor.Saoirse Ronan is lovely as Susie. I was more impressed with her when she played in Atonement, but yet, she shows a talent. I'm sure we'll hear more from her.Overall, this movie was a disappointment because of the view of the Inbetween, which was also very beautiful on the other hand. It's hard for me to form an opinion and to say what made me feel disappointed about this movie. You'd better see it for yourself.",The Lovely Bones
304,Zaphryn,What a waste,3,16 December 2019,"What the hell. If I was the family member of a murder victim, I'd be well pissed off at this movie's happy go lucky take on some of the worst things that can ever happen to you as a family. It's illogical, incoherent, way too light and happy dappy, cuts out the essential scenes of something so terrible and just altogether fails. The way the family figures out who the murderer is is ridiculous, nothing but a few weird, tense eye stare moments and apparently their ""instinct"" just lets them know, making them act unnatural and cringe worthy with the killer, in-between strange scenes of the victim's MDMA limbo. I thought the dark haired girl would be an essential character, like a medium who would be Susie's contact to the world to get her justice, but no, she was useless and had no relevance. When her sister finds the book with all the evidence at the killer's house and runs back home while getting chased by him, she almost forgets the urgency of death on her heels and her sister's murder when her selfish mother returns back home after a long time away, and so instead of an important scene of getting to her house in time both for her safety and to bust him, we're interrupted by an eye rolling scene of reunion, mummy hugging daddy, feeling a lot of feefees. Uuggh, the sugar in this movie is nauseating and feels more like an immature take on serial killers and loss from the perspective of an optimistic 11 year old movie maker than anything that truly deals with the devastation of your daughter being murdered, her body never being found and the burden of requiring answers for closure. In fact, it seemed like Susie dying was a great thing, the way she gets to spend time riding sleighs on snowy CGI hills with her co-victim and new BFF or having a photo shoot while disco dancing, or making out with her non-boyfriend in the possessed body of his actual girlfriend while the killer dumps her body in a safe in the background. Jesus H Christ, how anticlimactic, nonsensical and a complete waste of my evening, as well as the talent of these actors. Blargh.",The Lovely Bones
305,n3vermind,It starts out well but then...,4,14 March 2010,"I was actually in to the film for about 30 minutes but at 1 hour and 10 minutes I turned to my wife and said: ""is anything actually happening?"". And well the truth is that nothing actually was.I understand this is based on a novel and I can see this working really well on page, no doubt. I also have to respect Peter Jackson for thinking he could bring it to life but that is as far as I am willing to go.There is this classic struggle going on from the director about trying to add a storyline that we, the audience, can become a part of. This can be seen by the amount of cgi that is put in to try and grab us. I suspect this is because Mr. Jackson was painfully aware that there was nothing else for us to sink our teeth into.I don't think I can really recommend any segment out there to watch this because in the end you are left with some decent acting performances and a really good one (obviously) but also a story that can be complete told using 20 words or less and 2 hours is simply too long to try and stretch it to. Don't spend money on this movie, catch it on TV when it airs, I'm sure that won't be too long :).",The Lovely Bones
306,BelmaresJodene,the best movie of the year,10,9 May 2012,What the hell are you people smoking this is one of the 10 best movie ever made. This is one of the best book to movie adaptations I have ever seen. This film is sad happy and eerie all at the same time which in my opinion is very difficult to do. If you want an example of an atrocious movie check out twilight new moon. This film is brilliant exciting and emotional. I cannot tell you how much I love this film. This is a perfect example of a book to movie adaptation done right. I strongly recommend this movie to anyone who wants an accurate movie based on a book.

307,ThatGFFAN,I do not understand why people hate this movie,10,6 May 2019,"The Lovely Bones sadly suffers from the same problem a movie like say The Giver will. Because it was based off a book, people will constantly compare it to that book. Of course, that's a totally understandable thing to do and I can see why. But this movie took things in a different approach which I liked. Sure, compared to the book, there were a lot of things it did differently, but that's okay. It didn't kill the story. In fact, I feel some elements made it better. But of course, not everyone does and thus TLB is where it is today. Nonetheless, it was a bone chilling film and one that really made me quiver. As someone who read the book, I'm okay with the direction this movie went. It was bold and original and I liked it. But that's my opinion.",The Lovely Bones
308,Pilatunes,Deplorable,1,20 June 2010,"'Deplorable' is the adjective Rober Ebert used for this movie and it's the right one.Suzie Salmon is lured into a trap, raped, murdered and dismembered. We don't see the raping and dismembering but you can figure it out.It's about as horrific a crime as one can imagine but this movie treats it casually, almost a non-event, rather than with the solemnity a tragedy like this deserves.There are numerous other flaws in the movie, but this was enough for me.'The film's primary effect was to make me squirmy.' said Roger Ebert in his review. I'd substitute 'ill' for 'squirmy'.Don't see it.",The Lovely Bones

Suzy's just trapped in purgatory the whole movie with another character who does nothing but narrate her own objectives. The reason this movie doesn't make sense is because they just dance around the fact that Suzy got murdered. She just escapes in her mind but she's actually dead and we can sorta tell...kinda. This movie can't show a thing that's purpose isn't meant to be blatantly reincorporated. Whether it's Mark Wahlbergs' scale modeling, the hat, the snow globe, and even the icicles. I can't believe Peter Jackson directed this! It's just such a gigantic step down from the quality of the Lord of the Rings movies. Overall, this movie sucked.",The Lovely Bones
310,LeFreak-5,Not understanding all the hate,7,23 January 2010,"I loved the novel and thus had all of Sebold's poetic prose, characters, and images well formed in my head. But unlike so many, I don't get disappointed when film adaptations of novels depart from the source material. Instead, I get intrigued by the differences and similarities, and in many cases I come away appreciating the alternate vision of the filmmaker, and the challenges and choices he or she must have faced to bring the difficult and improbable to the screen. Things get dropped, fused, telescoped, reordered. And, to me, this comes off well more often than not. The secret is being open to it--once a writer surrenders rights to a work, it isn't his or hers anymore. It is the filmmaker's.Such is the situation with this film. The novel packs so much richness of character, plot, and emotion in its 300 original pages that Mr. Jackson had to make some choices. I, for one, really like the choices he made. On its own two feet, the film is solid, touching, and, I think, far more emotionally and morally ambiguous and sophisticated than some around here claim. My only criticism is that there is so much I craved to know, and so little time in which to do it, at times things seemed rushed and a little shallow. Some critics familiar with the novel have lamented the cursory treatment of Ruth and the shallow presentation of Lynn, who in the novel is flawed but strong and more than comic relief. Nonetheless, what Jackson has chosen to keep, alter, and leave behind results in something that works fine for me.I for one loved the much criticized rendering of Suzie's heaven. It departed greatly from my own vision of it, and as such was something fresh and new. The surreal shifting of colours, images, and shapes evoked, at least for me, thoughts of Kubrick (A Clockwork Orange, The Shining), Lynch (Twin Peaks, Mulholland Drive) and Fellini (8 1/2).I really liked it. And, judging from the unremarkable but still solid 6.8 rating, many others have too. I recommend to anyone to disregard the indignant rants of the disappointed book fans or the film school purists bleating ""too much CGI!"" and give the flick a go. It is a lot better than much other stuff out there at the moment.",The Lovely Bones
311,gotoads,Controversial but good,8,25 December 2017,"There are only mild ""spoilers"" in this review, so if you haven't seen it yet, you can read this without it ruining the movie for you. This film will always be remembered as the breakout role for the incredible Saoirse Ronan. It will also be remembered as one of the most controversial films ever made. People tend to break off into two camps: Team Salmon or Team Harvey.It starts off innocently enough: a boy-crazy teenage girl in the 1970s is crushing on a man at school. It seems that he is interested in Susie too and despite the disparity in age, she falls for his charms, mostly due to his exchange student allure and suave accent. As the film progresses, it becomes clear that another gentleman is also interested in the nubile teen. His name is Mr. Harvey and he lives in Susie's neighborhood. Unlike the man from school, Mr. Harvey puts in a tremendous amount of effort in an attempt to win the love of Susie Salmon. He builds her an amazing underground clubhouse, complete with all the stuff young people from that era loved. He had beverages such as Coca Cola that he selflessly shared with Susie as they hung out. It became clear that Mr. Harvey, while having great taste in females, was a bit awkward around them. His nervousness around Susie Salmon was evident and she picked up on that. Girls prefer a man with confidence. I also feel that maybe she was turned off because the Coke that Mr. Harvey gave her was warm. I didn't see an ice-filled cooler in the clubhouse anywhere. So I think these factors all led to Susie Salmon losing her patience, which erupted in an unfortunate display of rudeness. Mr. Harvey only had one rule in the clubhouse: Be polite. Susie Salmon broke that rule and the series of events that followed spiraled into one great, big, depressing chain reaction.There are no bad people in The Lovely Bones. True, Susie Salmon came off as being a little narcissistic and immature but she was only 14 years old. Mr. Harvey was socially awkward and made some questionable choices in life but he had a deep desire to be loved and respected. Despite his talents and generosity, it seemed nobody opened up their heart to him.",The Lovely Bones
312,SweetOOgaBOOga,People were expecting this movie to be something it wasn't meant to be. It was Beautiful.,10,15 January 2010,"I loved the movie. I'm lost as to why EVERYONE hates this movie. It wasn't meant to be a visceral, dark, gore movie like those that have been coming out these days. I think people are looking right past what it was meant to be, and is. It is a story of a child brutally murdered, but that's only one part of the story. It isn't a true story, it's FICTION. The fantasy and sweet emotion were meant to give a beautiful idea among all the horrific things that people commit on earth. That there may be a wonderful place in between (Hope). It was not meant to be a horror or thriller movie but an inspiring, uplifting movie despite the sadness. I'm not saying it was perfect but it certainly was NOT as horrible as people are saying. I enjoyed it. I was scared, I cried, I laughed and was entertained. Isn't that what a movie is all about?",The Lovely Bones
313,meininky,Not so lovely,5,19 January 2010,"The Lovely Bones is one of those books that just doesn't work as a movie. Voice-over is a tough tool to use well in a film (as Adaptation taught all of us), and when the work being adapted is so focused on a subjective narrator, it's hard to translate to the big screen. Where a book works with words, a movie should be able to use (mostly) images. In The Lovely Bones, Susie Salmon is an almost obnoxiously intrusive narrator, never allowing the characters she's describing to become rounded or anything more than objects she's observing. It's frustrating and drains the film of the assumedly inherent emotional weight, because we, as viewers, never get the chance to get to know the characters in a meaningful way. The exception is, as you may expect, Susie, but even with her, we barely scratch the surface, as she spends most of her time wandering wide-eyed through pretty, but plastic-y scenery and watching scenes from Earth. Saoirse Ronan, so talented in Atonement, gives another strong performance, especially considering the often-clunky dialogue she's given. Though she's removed from the main events of the movie, she still serves as the emotional core, and Ronan handles the range well, even if it is limited by Susie's actual presence in the story.The supporting cast is pretty tame. Susan Sarandon and Rachel Weisz, both immensely talented actresses, are reduced to one-dimensional versions of Alice Sebold's better-written characters. But luckily, Stanley Tucci is given (just) enough screen time to perfectly capture the creepiness of George Harvey. Between this role and that of Julia Child's husband in Julie & Julia, Stanley Tucci had a truly tremendous year, and all his accolades are well-deserved. His scenes with Ronan, in particular, are haunting and tense.The actual story, however, is severely butchered from the book, which in some cases is a good thing, but overall, everything is left too lean to have any resonance. Ruth and Ray are barely featured, Buckley only has a few scenes, and the absence of Mrs. Salmon's affair with Len leaves him as a character who has almost no purpose, beyond providing a foil for Mr. Salmon's obsessiveness (this is a good time to note that Mark Wahlberg is, thankfully, much better here than in The Happening).Instead of spending time on character development, Peter Jackson instead focuses on creating a dreamy ""in-between"" for Susie to frolic in. If you've seen the previews, you've seen all of the dreamscapes, and while they are creative and sometimes cleverly mirror the action unfolding on Earth, the special effects leave much to be desired. Some of the scenes look like they're taken from Super Mario Galaxy, while others look like they're made of plastic. Most of the interesting visuals are crammed into a single montage of Susie playing with her annoying friend Holly, while the others throughout the film all focus on the gazebo/lighthouse motif. It's tiring and repetitive.Alice Sebold's novel walked a fine line between murder story, family drama, and odd fantasy, never swaying too far into the sentimental or weird, but Peter Jackson has made a film that swings back and forth into both realms, sometimes going right for the heart (and missing, mind you), and other times presenting images that don't make much sense at all, even within the film's conceit. It's a disappointing adaptation, but there are bright spots, if you can stomach all the muck surrounding them.5/10",The Lovely Bones

Unless all you like are superhero movies, then I cannot imagine you will hate this. Highly recommended!",The Lovely Bones
315,rascal67,Visual overkill to mask a weak execution,3,1 January 2010,"I am an ardent admirer of Peter Jackson's 'Heavenly Creatures' and rate it #1 in my top 5 drama films of all time thus far. I was looking forward to seeing this film adaptation of Alice Sebold's novel—which I have not read—as it sounded like he was going back to his 'Heavenly Creature' roots with the story that was presented. I had read some disappointing reviews before seeing 'The Lovely Bones' so did not go in with much expectation but kind of hoping that the detractors may be wrong: unfortunately they were right.Where to begin: 1/ I found the acting weak and forced. Mark Whalberg was miscast and was so obvious at playing emotional and serious rather than being the feeling, like much of the movie there was no finesse to his performance. Rachel Weisz had hardly much to do at all and her role seemed lost and neglected—but I would put this down to editing choices. Stanley Tucci and Saorise Ronan fared better, but they are better actors than Whalberg so that goes without saying. Susan Sarandon was just a gross caricature.2/ Like Sarandon's performance, there was no subtlety to the presentation of the film. It's like Peter Jackson was too concerned with making a great looking technically impressive film which has overshadowed the human element of the story. Personally, I found some of the CGI effects second rate like something I would find in a television commercial: it just did not grab me and was surfeit.3/ While it appears that much effort had gone into the production design with some meticulous detail, it looked overdone and so fake 70's the actors looked like they were playing dress up and acting like they were still in the 21st century. The supporting roles were nothing to write home about at all and were just plain embarrassing to watch in some scenes. 'Heavenly Creatures' had strong performances, from then largely unknown actors and this film had nothing exceptional to offer in the thespian stakes, yet had a big name cast.4/ I was not connected or emotionally involved in the proceedings, due to the over-importance of the pyrotechnics on display and the screenplay was choppy and all over the place: too much forced fed sentiment. Maybe I missed something, but the style of the film did not mirror the substance and potential that was on offer and what could have been a moving and distressing experience ended up being distanced and flaccid.A huge disappointment!",The Lovely Bones
316,richard-hodges,A success on all fronts,8,31 December 2009,"First things first. I haven't read the book, but of course that isn't relevant to a review of a movie. The same way that writers Boyens, Walsh and Jackson haven't filmed a book, they've written a screenplay, based on a book. Furthermore Peter Jackson has taken a screenplay based on a book and interpreted it, in his own way, for the screen. My point is, surely the two mediums aren't connected. To complain that a film adaptation isn't faithful to its source material is about as ridiculous as blaming a hen for not providing the bacon.On that basis, I enjoyed The Lovely Bones enormously, if it's possible to enjoy a movie with such a dark subject matter. As a story it's moving, upsetting, affecting, involving, tense, engrossing and extraordinarily good to look at.The performances from all are straight from the top drawer, and support Jackson's visuals at every turn (and vice-versa). For me, top honours go to Weisz and Walhberg as Susie's suffering parents, and of course Ronan as Susie herself. The score by Brian Eno is wonderful, and noticeable without being overbearing.Jackson's The Lovely Bones is a success, not as an adaptation, though it might well be, but a good story extremely well told.",The Lovely Bones

This had all the implausibility of ""2012,"" plus crashing boredom to boot. Somehow, they got too enamored with creating elaborate visuals of the afterlife, or whatever netherworld this poor kid was dumped into. Once having created these special effects, they had to USE them, and LINGER on them, OVER AND OVER AGAIN. Thereby, they succeeded only in bringing the film to a screeching halt, which wasn't easy, because the pace was glacial to start with. Lost in the swamp was any psychological motivation of any of the characters, so it was hard to care about any of them. For example: Susie's sister, who, after discovering the murderer, and somehow escaping and getting back to her home with the incriminating evidence, runs into the house and stands there like a stone for an interminable pause rather than scream something and give the evidence to her parents. Or the ludicrous, improbable,and unsatisfying ending. I feel bad for the actors, many of whom have done great work elsewhere (most notably poor Stanley Tucci and Rachael Weisz).

318,cameragod,Subtle.,9,13 December 2009,"PJ has made a movie that requires some emotional buy in but returns it with interest. This is the first movie in a very long time where I actually care what happens to the characters. Not just the lead but the whole family, even the villain I care how their stories are resolved or not resolved.There is so much big and obvious stuff happening up front it is easy to miss the subtlety that runs beneath, so much that is implied rather than spelt out. It really hard to talk about without using spoilers (might do another post with spoilers) but trust me there is a lot more to this movie than meets the eye candy.If you are a relaxed film watcher that likes everything handed to you on a plate underlined with heavy handed dialog and massive visual cues then you will only get half of this movie and you still might enjoy it.If you are the type of movie watcher that doesn't mind working a little, reading a lot from inferences, pick up the tonal shifts and can see past the big CGI scenes and see them for what they are (a device to show Susie as small vulnerable and in jeopardy even though she is dead) then you are going to get a lot out of this movie and really enjoy it.",The Lovely Bones
319,ricburger,Excellent Story,9,28 May 2010,"I have to admit I didn't expect the film to leave me feeling the way it did. I knew going in it was a disturbing subject, but it was handled in a way that was quite unexpected. The cast handled their roles with great performances. Saoirse Ronan was outstanding. Probably the best young actress I've seen in years. I do hope she gets roles that properly make use of her talent. Stanley Tucci does a great job in immersing himself into his character. Interesting that the last role I saw him in was Julie and Julia. Going from playing a nice guy in that one, to a serial killer here. Pulled it off very nicely. Did it without looking real slimy, which unfortunately is how a lot of films portray characters like this. Sociopaths are very good at hiding, and that's how he played it. Never coming across as sniveling or overly excited. Mark Wahlberg and Rachel Weiz were also great as the parents. Kudos as well to Susan Sarandon, Michael Imperioli, and Rose McIver. Visually the film worked very well. Some of the CGI was a bit overdone, but most of it worked very effectively. I particularly liked the imagery where Susie's father is smashing all but one of the ships in a bottle, as Susie watches them smash on the rocks in her in-between world.

320,shreke2003,Beautiful and compelling masterpiece.,10,11 January 2010,"I'm appalled by the numerous attacks this film has garnered by both critics and more importantly film idiots. Due to these biased and unimaginative comments, i went into the film with a sense of separation, and left it feeling fully immersed. As a fan of all Peter Jackson's pictures including but not limited to: ""Bad Taste, Meet the Feebles, and Braindead."" I was hardly surprised at the level of artistic taste this movie carried. But what is a movie without a good script, and that is where i believe it shines.The story begins simply, a child reminiscing about her past and what it means to her. From there she carries on her life only to be snatched away and murdered by a reclusive psychopath. Within the first twenty minutes of this film, the emotions garnered in the audience are enough to satisfy most features. However in a movie of this capacity it is perfectly reasonable in expecting to be pulled on a roller coaster of emotions. I won't go into detail about the later portion of this film, except for saying it had me gripping the seat, wildly cheering for the protagonists.What a wonderful idea to mix so many elements in the story, a dose of thriller here, one of supernatural there, and adding my personal favorite, a real bastard to hate.I never read the book and begin to wonder if the bad comments weren't written by the illiterate fan's of Alice Sebold's novel. I say illiterate for lack of a better word and in no way am I disrespecting the aforementioned writer. I'm simply unsure where they went to school, because this movie seems to attract the hate of idiots. Even me, a seventeen year old, knows the difference between where and were. But alas i don't want to take up the page with my verbal abuse. So I'll spend just a little more time giving credit where it is due.To Saoirse Ronan, my sincere congratulations in pulling off such an extraordinary performance. My only hope is to see you more often in upcoming films.Mark Wahlberg who many say can't act, proves them wrong in his role as a father torn by grief and anger.But perhaps my greatest nod should go to Stanley Tucci, who whether through accident or design, embodies a truly evil man. Someone who gave up bitterness for his wrongdoings long ago, and in turn entered a new stage of rotten. In a film such as this, it is crucial for the antagonist to be an actor of considerable prowess, and i believe we have such a character in Mr Tucci.And of course a round of applause to the other amazing actors that bring this film to fruition, without you it would've been an empty spectacle. Peter Jackson, please continue wowing us with your vibe and creativity. Proving that dreams can come true, even if they are started as an eight year old boy. Once more for any late comers, I despise the rude comments on this title, I enjoyed it deeply even plan to view it again, and finally would love to see it's ratings improved.Thank you very much, and wishing you all a long and happy life.....",The Lovely Bones
321,Kaserynofthegyre,Jackson makes a decent film from an unfilmable book,8,4 January 2010,"Most of the extreme criticism from contributors here seems to revolve around either the differences from the book or the fact that the killer is never caught (which oddly is the same as the book).Neither, I think, are fair.Changes from the pretty much unfilmable book were always inevitable. The book focuses primarily on the the fracture, and healing, of the relationships between Susies surviving family members and those around them. In what would have been a nine hour screenplay Alice Sebold explores how people deal with grief, the lack of closure, and the realities of getting on with life. The murderer and the hunt for him are background McGuffins.In adapting the book Jackson and his co-writers had to emphasise the dramatic tension in trying to identify the killer, greatly contract the timelines involved and try to simplify the relationships without losing their importance. They already proved they could do the near impossible when they made The Return Of The King filmable and they get almost as close here.I'm not sure why people insist on comparing books to films as though one should be ""better"". Is the musical ""Cats"" 'better' than TS Eliots ""Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats""? No, and it's not worse either. Its a different medium that should be judged on it's own merits.The killer gets away (from human retribution anyway) because - from the story point of view - thats what makes the other characters stories worth knowing. Susies parents ability to go on, rediscover their love for each other and live again without the pat ending seeing the killer brought to book is what makes them special people worth making a film about.The film isn't perfect. Susan Sarandon's as Susies grandmother is great but doesn't get enough interaction with her daughter. Rachel Weiss's return to the family home could have done with more time spent on it. But the visuals are a treat and after this and Atonement, Saoirse Ronan has proved herself a stunning young talent to be watched closely.",The Lovely Bones

It made me angry to see that this sort of stuff happens in the real world.It got to me in heart broken sort of way, and I can honestly I was satisfied in the end.but i agree this movie may not be for everyone, so the least you can do is rent it ad check it out, and who knows! maybe you will find it worth watching.

The acting, by all accounts is wonderful. Stanley Tucci is marvellous,Susan Sarandon as usual is superb, as is the young actress in the main role as Susie, however somewhere between telling the story and visually presenting the story, the magic was lost. I do think the film is worth a watch perhaps once for the outstanding performances, but I don't think it's a classic. The film is in many ways a feast for the eyes, with the special effects done well and the clear 1970's vibe being authentically presented in a subtle manor, however, there is just something wholly unsatisfying about the production which I can't put my finger on.",The Lovely Bones

This movie wants to be great. A work of art. Possibly a masterpiece. I have no doubt that Oscars were whispered of at some point during production. But here's the catch: it's no good. It sounded like a few of the blue-haired grannies in my audience were touched, but if all your synapses are still firing properly you won't be joining them. This is one of the most overwrought and mawkish films in years and the more it tries to move you the funnier and more cringe- inducing it becomes. An astounding misfire.Okay, so a fourteen-year-old girl named Susie Salmon is murdered. Not a spoiler, that's how the movie starts. But oh, it's not over for her yet! We follow Susie on up into heaven where she gets to hang out with other murdered girls and party and everything is magical happiness. It's supposed to be ethereal but just comes off as creepy. She narrates constantly to let us know exactly what we're supposed to feeling at every given moment. The screenwriters leave nothing to chance.Meanwhile back on earth the movie is going nuts with genres and crazy mood whiplash from scene to scene. Susie's parents, played by the respectively brown and black-haired Mark Wahlberg and Rachel Weisz whose daughters are somehow a pale redhead and a blonde, grieve for Susie in a made-for-TV family melodrama while simultaneously hunting for her killer in a detective movie. Whoa. That's one of the most poorly conceived things I've ever heard of. The tone is manic depressive; at one point the film swerves with neck-snapping force by going from Susie's parents sobbing over their murdered daughter's empty room immediately into a cleaning the house / dance montage scored to upbeat pop rock. It was all I could do to not start convulsing with laughter.And let's talk about Mark Wahlberg for a second. He sailed to the raggedy edge of overacting in 2006's The Departed but somehow kept hold, turning in one of the most entertaining screen performances of the decade. But apparently M. Night replaced him with a pod because two years later in The Happening he stank up the joint like nothing I've ever seen from a Hollywood leading man and here in The Lovely Bones he's nearly as bad, still cartoonishly widening his eyes and whining in a high pitch to emote and failing spectacularly. The child playing his fourteen-year-old daughter acts circles around him.So what happened? How could Peter Jackson have screwed this up so badly? Was the problem the script and subject matter, or as a filmmaker is he just better at operating in the broad strokes of good vs. evil and creature design? Either way, Peter, please, run back to Middle- earth and stay there. I'm still stoked for The Hobbit but my enthusiasm for Jackson's next non-Tolkein movie has been blunted into virtual nonexistence. The Lovely Bones is pretty much a lock for my bottom ten of the year.",The Lovely Bones
326,NeedAnswers,Very Moving,9,25 December 2018,A great story with beautiful scenery. I didn't think I'd like it as much as I did. Excellent acting and suspenseful.,The Lovely Bones
327,politik-69932,Don't take it so seriously ...,10,22 December 2019,"This film is in itself, quite lovely somehow given the tragedy it portrays.Not surprising then, that so many things about dates, times, location, weather have errors and please consider if these are really goofs or indeed intended goofs.If it was so accurate, you would assume the story being told was factual and and simply isn't and for some this could be a very upsetting film.
The story line is tragic and told very well and whilst we are all waiting for a happy ending, it may or may not be what we expect.All the of the actors adhere to a particular acting style as the story unfolds and Susan Sarandon is quite marvellous at holding the family together, even though she clearly has issues of her own.I enjoyed the film, I own it on DVD and think it is memorable",The Lovely Bones
328,thebc-86158,Would be great if Rated R and focused more on the suspenseful thriller rather than the fantasy.,6,8 August 2018,"The Lovely Bones is based on a novel of the same name which I haven't read about a girl in the 1970's (Saoirse Ronan) who gets killed by a seemingly harmless man (Stanley Tucci) after trying to escape him and goes to a purgatory- like world meeting a mysterious heaven girl and watching her family (Mark Whalberg, Rachel Weisz, Susan Sarandon, and Rose McIver) mourn her and trying to find a way to kill her killer. This film was directed by Peter Jackson director of both The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit trilogies and he is excellent with the wonder and terror of the death world scenes and the suspenseful scenes with Stanley Tucci. The acting is also great Tucci is terrifying, Ronan is believable, Sarandan is funny, and Whalberg and Weisz do great with the drama. Overall it's a long and drawn out fantasy, drama, thriller with great performances, suspense, and family drama but on the flip side it has long periods of boredom, cheesy Christian imagery (and I'm a Christian), and it can get down right weird and morbid for a PG-13 movie. 6.5/10 focus on the suspense and drama, make it R Rated (which it comes close to being with Tucci's character), and cut down on the scenes with the mysterious heaven girl.",The Lovely Bones
329,bagdad-42953,"So bad. So, so bad.",3,4 June 2020,"In the running for Worst Film of All Time! I guess so. Mainly because unlike, Santa Goes to Mars or Plan 9 From Outerspace, this movie is made by serious film makers with good intentions and big budgets.
80 or so people gave this a 10/10? Insane.
Gave it a 3 for good actors, doing their best. What they did was good. Oh, and Brian Eno wrote the score, he is a genius. All the rest is classic Peter Jackson. The screen time he gives to the pointless CGI of heaven directly takes time away from developing the other interesting characters and their relationships. Story is chucked. So many gaping holes. Jackson is so far up his a$$ that he doesn't think anyone cares about logic or making sense. You can get suspension of disbelief, but in a crime/serial killer story?! Jackson goes full 'hollywood', and just says, ""Hey, people don't care about that stuff. If doesn't need to make sense. People just want spectacle."" In a movie about death and murder?!?
Near the beginning was the funniest thing: The killer drives out to the middle of a stubble cornfield, but within sight of houses, a cornfield backed up to his own backyard and others, and a common shortcut for HS kids, and digs out a 10x10x20 underground bunker? Where did all the dirt go? If he dug that by hand, it would take about 3 weeks! Please look at that scene and look at all the houses around. You will be laughing! Oh, and also emptied it of all his creepy trinkets, filled it back in, within days? Cops find it, but it generates no evidence.Another weird part that makes it seem as though PJ is just making stuff up is when the sister comes running home with her discovered evidence. First, she should have been screaming since she found it. Then she runs into the house to discover her mother has returned and we are met with a reunion scene and we get to the evidence in a minute or two. Wha?!? Not only is that unreal, but incredibly confusing to the viewer.The comedy relief segment in the middle with Susan Sarandon's grandma character is confusing and completely out of place.The final Kiss Scene is strange/confusing. Wouldn't Ray be freaking out?Peter Jackson has moved into the George Lucas category of directors: He made good films when he was young, and he collaborated with writers, producers, and editors. After huge blockbuster success, he does what he wants, how he wants, and nobody tempers his worst instincts. Nobody has the power to tell him, ""NO"". So, we get self-indulgent garbage from now on.
(King Kong had the same problem as this film- completely forgot the story and characters, in order to splash CGI everywhere)This movie is completely confused from start to finish. I watched because it is a train wreck. Never read the book.",The Lovely Bones
330,nyomnyomnyommmmmm,Tugs at the heart strings,7,17 April 2021,"This is the first film I watched where I felt a sad emotion at the end. IT wasn't a bad ending, but it wasn't great, it was just thought provoking.I thought the death scene of the killer was cosmic justice however I wish he were arrested instead and it really hurt to see Salmon's body just get lost to the earth never to be found. It was scary, it showcased the fragility of life, we can go at any moment but it's what we leave behind that matters, the impact we make on the lives of the people around us. I believe that was the point of the film and it entails the dead girl's journey to understanding that the world can exist without her in it and that her family will go on and that the death has changed them but it's not necessarily all in a bad way. That it's okay for them to move on and that is what she does in the end too, accepting the world without her.The film also had an accurate portrayal of grief that felt relatable, I could feel a certain empathy for the Salmon family and it honestly did play with the heart strings.I didn't really enjoy the supernatural aspects of this film as I feel that it took away from the realism of the film.It was a sombre viewing but I truly enjoyed it and it's made me think quite a lot.",The Lovely Bones
331,chrisbanach-1,"If anything, this movie proves Jackson is a total scam.",1,2 January 2010,"First off, compared to directors such as Cameron, Spielberg or Scorcese, I always considered Peter Jackson over rated and a total scam. For one simple reason: he can't write a story.Let's just review his 3 biggest hits: 1) Lord of the Rings > Book from Tolkien 2) Kink Kong > well, a cover of a cover from the 1933 movie 3) Lovely Bones > another adaptation from a bookI mean, can't Jackson write his own story for god's sake???Spielberg and Cameron are great story tellers, but Jackson is just good at directing a CGI team for his visual effects, but that's about it, no 'vision' whatsoever behind them.Anyway, back to the movie...I'm an atheist, thus my opinion about the story is off course slightly biased, but still, I can appreciate a good screenplay dealing with after-life, such as the movie 'Ghost' with the late Patrick Swayze or The Sixth Sense with Bruce Willis.With this movie, at best Jackson succeeds in achieving a bad M. Night Shyamalan movie. A lifetime B-series rehashed story about a ghost not willing to 'let-go'.The girl is OK, but besides the opening scene when she saves her brother, I wasn't really convinced. She was... meh.Mark Wahlberg's acting skills are close to pathetic. Seriously, Peter, what were you thinking?... Wahlberg should've sticked to his already pathetic career as a member of New Kids on the Block. This guys has no place in a movie, period.Rachel Weisz is a different story, I'm deeply in love with her, so I can forgive her pretty much anything, including bad career moves such as this terrible movie.If you want to really see stunning visual effects with a compelling story, go rent 'The Fountain' instead, also with Rachel Weisz.Lovely Bones has visual effects so terrible (not in quality but in CONTENT) that they reminded me of Robin William's ""What Dreams May Come"", a movie from 12 years ago with a similar story and visuals as pathetically uncreative as this one.For me, Jackson is an over rated average director. And don't start with the CGI, because if you worked in this field, you'd know Jackson has ZERO knowledge on 3DStudio, Maya etc... whatsoever. At best, he was good at recruiting a guy who supervised a guy who was the project manager for a team of CGI graphists. And even that is not so sure, as most of the time, these teams are imposed by the studios. What's left then? Poor character development (you won't care neither for the girl, nor for the parents. Too bad for a movie that's supposed to be a drama) and scenes with nothing original, neither in direction nor in camera moves or angles. Really, go see Avatar instead.",The Lovely Bones
332,WaltWiz,An indigestible mix,5,31 May 2013,"The movie starts out as a promising serial killer film, but then descends into melodrama and mawkishness that feel completely inappropriate and out of place in a film that features a child-murdering psychopath. Stanley Tucci does a great job portraying the killer, but is given too little screen time to make the most out of his role. Instead, the movie focuses on the dead girl being emo in a corny rendition of purgatory, which is as gripping as it sounds, and on her family and friends dealing with the loss, which is somewhat more interesting, but feels inappropriate and premature when you know the killer is still on the loose and planning his next move. Also, there was a moment that literally drove me to rage. The dead girl's sister breaks into the killer's house, discovers his diary and nearly escapes capture...and then decides not to say anything because she thinks it may hurt the chances of her parents' reconciliation. At this point I was like, ""You've got to be f****ing KIDDING me!"" That's the stupidest and most offensive thing I've seen in any movie, ever. I give it 4 stars for Stanley Tucci's acting and 1 for everything else.",The Lovely Bones
333,ketaki-dutta,Beautiful !!!!,9,31 May 2010,"This movie was like a beautiful piece of art sculpted with great love and care by a skilled artist. The story of this little girl, her existence somewhere in the middle of reality and the paradise was depicted so beautifully. Throughout the movie there are so many strings that connect all at the end leaving a beautiful trail behind it.Coming to the actors, all the actors have done a great job. Special mentions go for Mark Wahlberg as Jack Salmon, who did a heart touching job as the Father. Saoirse Ronan as Susie had a thrilling performance definitely gave me goosebumps. Watch out for Stanley Tucci as Mr Harvey- he will surely give you a chill down your spines with his performance. Susan Sarandon and Rachel Weisz bring freshness and love to the movie.Overall, this movie is definitely worth a watch. This movie has awesome cinematography, with a beautiful storyline, thrill, suspense and mind blowing performances by the actor. Serious movie lovers......give this a shot !!!!",The Lovely Bones
334,eliz_rug,Pretty good,5,1 May 2010,"Other than the fact that I was convinced that was Judd Nelson and was then surprised to see it was Stanley Tucci, the film wasn't too exciting for me. I read the book, and enjoyed it, but wouldn't put it on my list of favorites.Susan Sarandon as the grandmother was so NOT-convincing, and the other actors, other than Saoirse Ronan and Tucci, were way too bland. The scenography was strange, but nice, almost peaceful.I like how the actual attack wasn't portrayed. If it had been, it would only have been done so for ratings, the shock factor, so I'm glad the director didn't need to go there.I watched the film feeling like I was waiting for something, and at the end, I didn't feel that that wait was over, so I was left feeling a bit disappointed.",The Lovely Bones
335,katherine_stears,Movies Suck: I didn't know it was a book first. I probably would have hated it more if I'd known that.,5,29 June 2010,"I would first love to say that the visuals in this movie at times LITERALLY took my breath away. The in-between world Susie spends the course of the film in is just beautiful. Everything is so big, and gorgeous and spacey and I just loved looking at it. I wish more time had been spent there just so I could stare at it some more. I loved it. Sometimes it was such a beautiful fantasy land, and sometimes it was so close to the mortal world Susie could actually watch real-life events going on around her, and almost communicate with the living. It was unreal, and a beautiful concept. I absolutely loved it. I can't stress that enough; it just pulled me in and it held onto my for all its life and it wouldn't let me go.But let's get on with the actual movie. ""The Lovely Bones"" is about Susie Salmon, who is fourteen years old when she is murdered by Mr. Harvey, the neighborhood creepy guy who makes a point to make himself inconspicuous. When Susie dies she goes to the in-between world and refuses to move on. During her stay she meets Holly, who tries to convince her to just keep going, and never look back on the mortal world. Susie doesn't. Meanwhile, her father and sister are losing their minds trying to find the man who killed her. It's a sad movie about innocence; those who have it, and those who lose it. (see, this movie was so compelling it's got me writing all artsy-like. This is getting weird for both of us, I'm sure)It had a lot of really good elements that I've already mentioned, but the biggest beef with me is that the movie as a whole is actually really boring. There were times where it got so excruciating I could hardly stand to pay attention. I think one of the biggest problems I had was, typically when someone gets murdered in a movie you spend most of the movie trying to figure out who did it. Well in this movie, we already knew. We knew right from the beginning. We are flat-out TOLD who did it, because the girl who was murdered is the one walking us through the story. So not only can we not occupy ourselves with figuring it out, we have to watch all the people who don't know struggle to figure it out for themselves, which could at times be really infuriating.So in the end if you can sit through it, ""The Lovely Bones"" is a really captivating, beautifully visualized tale of the very sad topic of murder and loss. It's just not particularly entertaining. And I happen to know it IS possible for murder stories to be entertaining. Just look at ""Law and Order"".This review was edited for length and content.

336,movieHIT88,"Magnificient performance by central character, unforgettable film",9,17 August 2019,"After watching the movie for the first time last night, I have been unable to get it out of my head. A good film I find always resonates. Jackson chose an excellent and unique way of portraying the story. The cast was superbly cast, could not imagine another actress playing Suzie as well as Saoirse, her portrayal captured the innocent essence of the character, which was central to the success of the film. I am sure Jackson's direction also helped. Wahlberg and Weisz perfect as the perplexed and simple living 70's parents. Sarandon was perfect as the quirky, somewhat hard but worldly and wise character of the matriarchal grandmother. Good to see Wahlberg, in this film, for a change, was not the character who road over the hill like the cavalry, saving the day. The 1973 film set was perfect. I liked the way, Tucci's characters portrayal, at the end of the day showed him as a pathetic human being and how Suzie's spirituality, determination and eventual revenge, drove the film the whole way. Loved it",The Lovely Bones
337,kvdlinde20,A really good movie,9,3 July 2021,"One reviewer called this movie hauntingly beautiful, and I agree. I'm also glad that Jackson decided to omit certain parts of the book, as it would have been to traumatising to watch. One doesn't need visual confirmation to know what happened. It would have been unnecessary shock factor and a catalyse for unwanted and disturbing nightmares. I also liked the deviation from the mom's story line as that is such a cliche.",The Lovely Bones
338,allkrueger,I hated the book but loved the movie,10,17 July 2016,"First of all I hated the book the Lovely Bones. I hated the book because I did not feel that there was any justice for the murdered girl, Susie Salmon. In the beginning of the novel, the author describes a gruesome rape where the victim gets dismembered and mutilated afterward. The cops know that Susie is dead because the find her elbow! That grossed me out and I am not squeamish. The ending of the book was not happy making for me because the killer dies by getting harmed by an icicle. That was not enough for me after knowing how Susie suffered and died. The film on the other hand was marvelous. The entire cast was perfect. Mark Wahlberg played the father and he carried this film. He was the protagonist that I was rooting for the most. I liked Wahlberg from the film, I love Huckabees with Jude Law and Naomi Watts. Mark Wahlberg is a versatile actor who can play tough guys and sentimental guys. My favorite scene was when Susie was in ""purgatory"" and she was communicating with her father using fire. I also loved the rose scene. Rachel Weisz was beautiful in this film (because to me she is very physically beautiful to look at). The actress who played Susie is so cute and talented. I would like to see her in more films. Stanley Tucci was unrecognizable and he was outstanding as the murderer. Susan Sarandon was good too. The special effects were great and the cinematography was breath taking. I had no idea that the Lovely Bones could look this gorgeous on film.",The Lovely Bones

340,wcrawford-07339,Hauntingly beautiful,7,21 March 2021,"I don't understand the bad reviews. I think the heavenscapes were beautiful and well done. A morbid and spooky tale, but a true one for so many people in this world who have lost loved ones to brutal murder. For those who believe in the afterlife I think a film like this would bring some solace to a lot of people who have experienced similar trauma. Saoirse Ronan is amazing and perfect for the role as Susie. I feel like her body should have been found and returned to the family. I would have done a few things differently at the end, but I guess that's the sad part about it sometimes people are never found. I liked
how they showed the families primal instincts and following their intuition, there is something so powerful about that.",The Lovely Bones
341,Vitor_Rodriigues,Boring.,6,7 October 2021,"After the first 15 - 20 min the film gets so boring, and to make it worse there just SO MUCH dumb and non sense scenes, i didn't like how they portrayed the behaviour of a serial killer that much and i guess i could call the performances decent. Some little creativity with the camera angles is used sometimes but then they ruin it by making it repetitive... I know this was probably supposed to be a more childish movie but still, it was not it.With that plot, i just know this movie could have been better.",The Lovely Bones
342,chrisinaltoona,A Movie That Makes You Both Sad And Happy,8,10 January 2010,"I usually don't like this type of slower paced, heartfelt, dramatic tragedy love story, but this one was different and I honestly can't explain why. The story itself is well written, and realistic when the film is not in the other world view. A young schoolgirl in love with her first boyfriend, a dad with a special relationship with that firstborn daughter and a normal nice family living their life in a simple normal town, and along comes something wicked. I actually felt the families pain, particularly the dad's even more than the murdered girl herself who was watching over them in some type of altered dimension. Even though this film is described as a murdered girl looking down on her family and killer from heaven or a place in between, struggling to decide to do whats right, the movie itself never mentions religion or god, a few people mention heaven once but the film itself never tells where the girl is or where she is going and has no religious tone, I actually loved that being I don't believe in god and a person can imagine their own form of what heaven or afterlife would be. It was a spectacular altered dimension with pretty good special effects, it was overwhelmingly beautiful with a sense of evil lurking in the distance because of the unknown that awaits her. It is a bit slow in the beginning but well worth the watch.",The Lovely Bones
343,cowman57-1,Both loved it and hated it.,6,1 February 2010,"The Lovely Bones is a hard one to rank because I both loved it and hated it.First off, obviously it was going to contain some seriously awesome and stunning scenery because Peter Jackson was behind the directorial helm. And it did: the heaven scenes where our (dead) protagonist's imagination blended with beautiful nature scenes were amazing- like the tree whose leaves suddenly turned into birds that flew away (see movie poster) or the life-sized ships in a bottle that were crashing ashore. This movie may seem like an odd choice for Jackson to direct, given what it's about, compared to his other films. Actually though, I think his adept ability to deliver such powerful fantastical sequences made this movie work. It does the girl's tale justice.Also, the acting was solid. I tend to like Mark Wahlberg because there's a soft side to his gruff manliness, which definitely shines through here. Our protagonist, Saoirse Ronan (try pronouncing that name), played it just right- ghostly and eerie yet sad and longing. Stanley Tucci played a complete 180 role here especially when you compare this part to that in Julie & Julia or Devil Wears Prada. Finally, Susan Sarandan was hilarious and provided the brief comic relief that we desperately needed half-way through.Okay, now to the obvious parts that I hated about this movie. I don't think I'm going to be giving anything away by saying that Stanley Tucci's character was a sociopathic pedophile who raped and murdered a little girl. And boy was his character a creepy, ugly, scary, and messed up creepster. I just can't feel at much peace with this movie, no matter how it ends, after having seen a vision of him in a bathtub filled with dirt and blood right after he murdered that girl. I'll bet that many people don't even feel satisfied with the ending, though I won't say anymore.Overall, The Lovely Bones was a powerful and sad movie that certainly brought out a lot of emotions (including real fear) and hit home for everybody who cares about children and families-- well, for anybody who cares about people. It was written without fear and directed with talent. It's not an easy or really enjoyable movie to watch, but it does do a good job of showing how families struggle to come to terms and cope with such awful tragedies. If you watch it, you will certainly feel disgusted and sad with a lesser chance of feeling uplifted.",The Lovely Bones
344,garrysutherland,A terrible terrible movie,1,6 January 2010,"You expect rather more from someone with the presumed talents of Peter Jackson, so it is something of a shock to be presented with something as poor as this. He really must learn to put away the CGI stuff when it is not needed. This could have been an enormously strong story, if you can suspend your disbelief in the religious gobbledygook, if it had focused on the family and what was going on there. I cannot believe that Susan Sarandon agreed to appear in this. Her treatment was appalling, a caricature of a drunken slut of a grandmother with absolutely no saving graces. And what was Rachel Weisz for? Window dressing! I hope that they sue Jackson for this pile of crud. Take away some of his money so that he is forced to produce bare bones (no pun intended) movies for a while. He really needs to learn proper movie craftsmanship before being let loose with any more big budgets. I think that the success of LOTR has gone to his head and that he thinks he can get away with anything. On the basis of this, I think I will be giving the Hobbit a wide berth.",The Lovely Bones
345,learningthelingo,The Lovely Lovely Bones,9,12 January 2010,"So reactions upon my friends seem to be fairly mixed. But one thing that Alex and I do agree on, is that we think that The Lovely Bones is lovely.Over a year ago, I read one of the ""must read"" that had been floating around on bestseller lists everywhere around the world. Alice Sebold's story of Susie Salmon, a fourteen year old girl who was raped and murdered and thus watches and aids her family from heaven into discovering the perpetrator who lives just houses away.The book blew me away. It was gruesome and yet funny, melancholic and yet uplifting, and a true page turner. I have had friends who have also loved the book, and when we heard news of the book being turned into a movie, skeptics summoned their opinions. Mine? It's in Peter Jackson's hands. Can you get someone who has been more faithful to a piece of literature? Now, I admit, I'm not the biggest Lord of the Rings fan (but I would like to be.give me time!!!!) However, I've seen Jackson's other work before LotR which featured a gruesome ghoulish ghost story The Frighteners and a lesbian melodrama murder mystery in Heavenly Creatures, just to name a couple. Jackson is such an interesting filmmaker, and it is this blending of the wonderful scripts, co written by long time collaborator Phillipa Boyens and even longer time collaborator and wife of Mr. Jackson, Fran Walsh.So came time for viewing the movie. I did so on my birthday, and to me, this was the perfect birthday film. I took along five friends, all bar one who were slightly surprised at my choice of seeing this as an enjoyable birthday film. The one who wasn't surprised had also read AND loved the book, so we were quite anxious and nervous as well. But I kept thinking, it's alright.Peter Jackson.It was, for all intents and purposes, heavenly. While the story is not the lightest of stories, it dealt with the running emotions of grief in such an honest way, whether Hollywood-ised or not, that it was quite the experience going through the film. Luckily, the two dedicates of the book were pleased. However, my other friend did not feel the overwhelming desire to see the film again, simply because it was an almost traumatic experience. This I accredit to the suspense that Jackson brings to the story, and is most painfully (and wonderfully) exercised in a sequence which has Susie's sister inside the house of the man that killer her, just as he comes home to discover someone in his house. The thing that made it so suspenseful was the soundtrack. Or lack thereof I should say. I was literally sitting in my seat in awe, completely under the spell of thinking that Jackson is a genius. His closeups and the mood that surrounded them were just simply amazing to one, who seems to be either imitating Hitchcock, or simply becoming his modern protégé.As for the acting. Once again, blown away. Saoirse Ronan (the young Academy Award nominated actress from Atonement) had such a central and significant part to the story, and thank god handled it so honestly with vulnerability, humour and just sheer talent. I was skeptical about the casting choice of Mark Whalberg, but he even managed to slightly impress me. I think the boy has talent! Rachel Weisz broke my heart in the aftermath of grief that came after the police informed of Susie's death. Susan Sarandon was brought in so effectively for comic relief and as the glue which held together this extremely fragile story (and look great as an alcoholic bad ass grandma!) And of course, Stanley Tucci (who I think is one of the main contenders for the Best Supporting Actor Academy Award in this performance) was one of the creepiest characters I've seen portrayed on film, probably since Javier Bardem in No Country for Old Men.An interesting point to consider, and one that I think saw polarising my friends who I saw the film with and others whom have seen in since, is the films idea of heaven. The film (and the book) give off an strong impression of a ""between place"" and a heaven, thus propelling an idea of an afterlife forward. Naturally, bring up religion, and you're gonna get opposing opinions. However, what I liked about this take of the ""in between place"" is that is subjects the audience to an idea of energies being present of those who have passed within those who remain. This idea, while perhaps more subtle than the computerised Avatar style projections of heaven (and boy did it look amazing too) is the one that has the lasting impression to me, and follows the themes of the story as well.So there, I've said it. I see Jackson as a modern Hitchcock. I don't know he is going to continue in such a suspenseful arena, however, I would love to see more. And also, look out for his Hitchcock style cameo in the mall. And his poster for a certain famous book trilogy in the window of a mall too.Genius!",The Lovely Bones

One time, you're watching Saoirse (who plays the lead one) in an ocean and the next minute, she is in floating in the sky! There were one too many life-after death imaginary scenes and you will yawn quite a few times. Saoirse Ronan and Stanley Tucci do their share of good acting, and Wahlberg tried to trail behind.

347,droog57-704-79517,I get it...,8,4 April 2010,"I only registered so I could post this review. I get this movie, although a lot of people apparently don't. I almost turned it off a couple of times in the first 20 min, but it grabbed me. I found myself affected by it. It will alternately move you, horrify you and make you laugh out loud, all within the first half hour. The story line takes you all the way down and then lifts you way up (no pun intended) and finally leaves you with hope and peace. I had no idea what to expect, this is not like anything that I thought I would see from Peter Jackson, but I see what he was trying to do, which is to elicit an emotional response from the audience, and unless you are an atheist (that's a religion too BTW) or made of stone, you will be moved by this movie. Isn't that what we look for in a good movie? Well done PJ, I get it.(BTW, I don't think that Tucci was playing against type, remember HBO's ""Conspiracy"", he was chilling in that effort as well.",The Lovely Bones
348,worldofjohnboy,Still wondering what to think? Perhaps...,7,13 January 2010,"I didn't really know what to expect in this film going into it, but knew that the visuals and imaginry would likely be good considering Jackson directed it. Overall, the film definitely kept my interest in it throughout the entire film. I was a big fan of flow of the plot and the cgi effects and imagination Jackson shows in the main character's world was really nothing short of fantastic. Character-wise, I felt there were many that were either under-developed or they ""disappeared"" during large parts of the movie. This wouldn't have been as big of an issue had they not omitted the development of one character that was (in my opinion) a key part of the film.As my sister stated, the plot wasn't as predictable as I initially thought and even 3/4ths of the way in, I was still puzzled by some of the minor and major twists given. After the movie ended, and still to this point, I have been thinking about the film and trying to figure out all of the messages it was trying to convey. I now realize that much of what I can take from this film is what I decide to take from it... there is a freedom that Jackson and company gives you to decide what to make of the holes, what to put in the spots that at first you believe are a gaping plot hole.The rating of this film seems a bit low for the tones and situations it deals with: Murder, afterlife, ""pedophelia,"" etc. All in all, I want to see this movie at least one more time as perhaps I can get a little bit better understanding of the underlying themes this movie offered up to me the first time I saw it.",The Lovely Bones
349,donmunk321,"Brilliant supernatural drama, emotional and tense",9,28 May 2012,"Brilliant film, quite shocked by how many people did not enjoy it, I suppose each to his own, I mean it is a horrible subject and being a parent watching it, also makes me feel a little bit sick in a way but the sad thing is that things like this really happen but I just thought the film was pretty flawless.Great acting from all the cast, the ""villain"" was extremely creepy and a believable, Wahlberg come across well as a concerned parent and Ronan was just terrific, especially since the subject and the fact in real life she must be around that age, just brilliant really. I really got brought into the story and felt quite emotional and even cared for the characters, really hoping I get to see karma unfold itself for the monster. Some scenes I was nearly yelling at my TV!I have noticed a lot of people have been moaning about the graphics, I did not see no problem with the graphics I thought it all come across quite well as it was suppose to be outer-worldy, what is suppose to look like? Maybe the story just had me so hooked that the graphics did not phase me but I really don't understand what the fuss is about, its heaven, it suppose to look different, it suppose to look unimaginable really.The only flaws I can really say are three different scenes they could have had a few changes but as I have not read the book it is kinda hard for me to judge because Jackson may have just been following the story.Suzie sister returning home after the chase. To be fair a lot of the critics have got a good point about this scene, I mean my mother enjoyed this film and she also moaned about this scene, It doesn't really make sense that Suzie's little sister is not screaming or in a state of shock or ringing the police as soon as she is home and also the fact she seems to be doubting whether to show the book is confusing considering the circumstances, I know the mothers return most have been a shock and perhaps she did not want to spoil the happy reunion moment and maybe she was not sure whether to leave it in the past but I think the truth about your little sisters murder and the chance for justice would overall any family moment, not to the mention the fact she was close to being a victim as well and could have been in harms way.The karma/divine intervention scene is in a way a good scene but also a bit of a let down, I really wanted to see him punished, most of the film I was close the yelling ""get the scumbag!"" at the TV. Not saying Harvey had a happy ending, it would have hurt a lot but also been quite quick and sudden, would have perhaps rather see him get arrested and have to live his life behind bars, but then again the legal system can not always be fair and maybe that is a point that is suppose to be raised in the film or maybe see Suzies father get hold of him, but then I suppose that would have destroyed the Salmon family even more. I think it was a good scene but also it was kinda a anti climax considering the whole film I was waiting on his karma, was a little bit disappointed but also entertained and I suppose a accident is more true to life, I am on the fence about it really.Finally my last minor disappointment was the dump scene, I kept thinking any minute the safe is going to fall open and all will be revealed, I was waiting for the Gothic teenager and Suzie's crush to come running over perhaps stopping Harvey or intervening some how, maybe seeing Harvey caught there and then, seemed only fair that her parents would get to bury Suzie and put her to rest, but then again Suzie does basically do that herself in her closing monologue about the fact she says something along the lines of ""these are my lovely bones"" which does not actually mean her body, well she explains it herself. In a way the body not being laid to rest is more realistic, lot of murders do happen when bodies are never found, and I suppose it is ""fair"" because Suzie was not the only victim but I was hoping her remains did not just end in a skip.Overall I was really taken back by this film, heard a little about it awhile back but I looked past it and wasn't planning at all on going out my way to see it, just happened to stumble across it on TV last night thought I would give it a watch out of boredom and I am so glad I did. Will definitely be buying on DVD and in gonna grab a copy of the book to read, I only read true crimes books, the last time I read fiction (over than comics) was The Shining in about 2002 so it shows it really made an impact on me.Done with my waffle , you all probably gonna completely disagree but it's only my opinion.",The Lovely Bones
350,myrtols,Heartbreaking amazing story,8,5 March 2021,"I loved everyone's acting, the story was one of the most heartbreaking stories I've ever seen adapted in film.

351,unitythroughterror,Probably the best work from Peter Jackson. Ever.,10,17 April 2014,"Many people have slammed this movie upon its release. I have heard some of the most atrocious things said about it. Naturally I didn't read the book before I saw the film, I have since. Indeed, these two works could not be more different - the only similarities between them being the name of the story they depict. Anyone who is a fan of Alice Sebold's unflinchingly graphic, brutally honest, and pull-no-punches approach will be disappointed. That is one way to tell the story. In terms of putting the tragic yet triumphant tale of Susie Salmon's ill-fated, premature departure from life on paper - her approach was the best, and absolutely mandatory. Sebold took a horror that happens to young women all over the world, including herself, and created not only art but something drawing attention to such matters. The Lovely Bones as a book is crucial not only because of the amazing views it draws on such a taboo subject, but because of the attention it incites in people. Rewind the clock and it's very true - people simply didn't want to believe things like Susie's murder could come into fruition. My mother, a child in around the same time period as the Salmons, was almost a victim of the same crime. Luckily she turned the other way when such an invitation was presented. As a movie, a doggedly faithful adaptation would not only not work - it would ruin what the book intended to maintain: a spirit of positivity despite the horror. While on paper horror and then stunning beauty can live side by side, in a film they cannot. As a filmmaker myself, I have to say I think Peter Jackson did the best job any director could do in telling this story. Had Susie's rape and murder been depicted in a Last House on the Left-style way, that would have overwhelmed the whole movie and ruined the pacing. The movie is faithful in its maintaining the grim beauty and positive spirit of the book, but to do that - and to do that in a way that many people across the globe can experience - takes tweaking. The result is an imperfect, overlong, yet undeniably beautiful film. Aside from the necessary evil of excessive heavenly CGI, the film feels like a dream captured on celluloid. I have yet to experience something as magical and affecting on screen as this film. A movie in my book doesn't need to be perfect - but it needs to make you think and feel. This really will make you think and feel, if you're the right sort of person for this movie. Altogether, an amazing if flawed film. Not a masterpiece, but something very special. Kudos to everyone involved - this is the best adaptation possible in my opinion. And probably the best and bravest PG-13 work we'll get from ultra-talented Peter Jackson post-Braindead/Heavenly Creatures.",The Lovely Bones
352,mdtyner,A terrible ending,2,9 July 2019,"When I devote a couple hours to a movie, especially one where a child has been killed and the killer is on the loose, I expect a satisfying resolution at the end. The contrived ending, where the boy kisses the transformed dead girl, was absurd. The killers death was equally contrived, falling from a parking lot was so impractical, giving him a quick death that was too generous. Then the dead girls body, being tossed away like trash, was disrespectful to the dead. And finally, the family was given no closure, no way to finally put closure to their grief. A terrible ending to a movie plot that had promise.",The Lovely Bones
353,scorpiowriter,LOVED IT--Beautiful CGI. And I hate CGI!,9,8 January 2018,"Really powerful, beautiful film. Yes, the underlying theme is frightening, but this is in no way a 'horror' film. It's a story about life, death, the Afterlife, vengeance, love, and ultimately, hope for justice.I decided to watch this movie because my father died today and I wanted to think about what it's like to be dead and 'in between' worlds. This movie really touched me and even inspired a few tears. The acting is overall, great. I feel that Rachel Weiss looked FAR too young in this film to be Susie's mother...she looked like an older sister. All of the characters are interesting in their own right. Susie's sister is a great character, as well. I thought Stanley Tucci's character looked so much like Javier Bardem I couldn't recognize him until I read the credits! Really enjoyed the music.And the CGI...I normally HATE CGI because I grew up in the 70's and 80's so I'm used to people in costumes, etc...those seem more 'real' than all the CGI 'monsters' they use nowadays. In this movie, CGI is used in a wonderful, beautiful and touching manner. Loved it, and recommend it highly.",The Lovely Bones

I hated how there were about ten scenes that had what I call 'Plotless Time Expanders' or PTEs. The finding the journal/chase scene were awful. Jackson was just determined to drag those out as far as possible without thinking about them clearly. And despite the fact that the OBVIOUS MURDERER is in the house the sister keeps READING THE JOURNAL! How realistic is that? And oh the ending. Sorry if I like justice but the killer just getting hit on the head and falling down the cliff. He may as well just lived to be a hundred and died of pneumonia. Honestly how God awful this movie was. Now, I could go on but I think I'll end the complaints there. There were moments that were artistically intriguing. That is all I have when it comes to giving a compliment.

360,jheatt,Sick movie,1,10 August 2019,"This weird movie is a trippy serial killer fantasy. No wonder Peter Jackson hides out in New Zealand.Stanley Tucci does his best Jimmy Stewart accent while acting like a creep. It's as if the movie is his fantasy and he imagines the girl he rapes and kills hanging around in spirit form. In his mind he actually does the girl a favor and sends her to some weird heaven where his victims frolic.I'm not sure who finds this movie as entertainment. Maybe Epstein or the Illuminati elite? It's pretty sick.I've also heard rumors that the real reason the protagonist, Susie, was killed by the Tucci character is because her father, played by Marky Mark, impregnated her and the wife found out. So she made a deal with the creepy neighbor at the rose bushes (Tucci) to off the daughter because she was pregnant. That's why she knitted the hat, so Tucci would be able to properly identify the right daughter. That's why the mother angrily tells the other daughter that she can knit her one also. That's why the Tucci character tells Susie that ""She's already late."" Even the name Susie Salmon is creepy. Salmon swimming upstream to spawn.And what's up with the weird younger brother? Did he suffocate in the refrigerator and that's why they take it to the sinkhole landfill? Is he a ghost? He disappears in the last third of the movie.

When the younger sister finds the proof needed to put that douche away. NOTHING HAPPENS! I mean WTF! The main character Suzie possesses a body and instead of saying hey my body's over there in a safe about to be lost forever. My killer will never be put away. Justice will never be done for all these other women and girls he has killed, she wants a kiss. Are you F'n kidding me! I thoroughly enjoyed this movie until the last 10 Min's.

362,tommister,"Visually yes, story-wise no",6,20 May 2010,"I have been very curious about Peter Jackson's career. I remember seeing Bad Taste in the 80's, Braindead and Meet The Feebles in the beginning of the 90's. Never thought that there would be real talent, but he proved me wrong already with Heavenly Creatures and Frighteners in the mid-90's. Then came the big surprise and success with the Lords. And what then? Jackson obviously is very fond of stories with the dead and the underworld creatures. The Lovely Bones does not make an exception. It is a story of a teenager girl, who is about to get her first date, when on the way back home, she is killed. She wanders the spirit world, sees her family, is aware of her killer, and tries to find peace.Story is not too original. The visual effects, and elements are, what Jackson knows well. He takes you to a world, that may not have been unseen, but definitely it is beautiful. Visually it tries to be somewhere there with Aronofsky's The Fountain, but does not quite reach there. Story-wise, it could be general remake of The Frighteners, but does not quite there either. All in all, beautiful film, but it does not have much to give. It does not have that usual entertaining touch Jackson usually has. Nor it gets inside the real feels, that young girl might have toward her killer. She speaks of hate, but you see that very little.Maybe, if you have not seen other films of Jackson, than the trilogy of the Lords, then this could be given a try. However, if you have seen The Frighteners, and Heavenly Creatures, you can give it a shot, but it can be waste of time. Been there, seen that.",The Lovely Bones
363,jim_baclagon,A Guilty Pleasure movie,8,18 January 2010,"After reading many bad reviews about the Lovely Bones I was weary of seeing it. First off, I never read Alice Shebold's masterpiece what-so-ever, so I came into the movie knowing A:It's about a Girl named Salmon and B: She goes to some funkadelic Acid Heaven cause she was murdered. And C: I'll be bombarded with pointless CGI-gasm from a fat-now-skinny director Peter Jackson. So, How was the movie? I was pleasantly surprised. I enjoyed The Lovely Bones a lot. So much so that I was wondering, what's all the fuss with the critics? Of course the critics probably read the book and guess what- Some Book-to-Movie adaptations will NOT be as you please.Of Course the movie did have some really corny CGI moments but all in all the movie never loss it's dark comedic fast paste tone which the director stated; it's how he thought of the book in the first place. For those people who said that the movie didn't take it's subject matter of rape and murder seriously- I thought it did. Mr. Harvey is one creepy guy and hats off to Stanley (his Golden Globe Nod was nice.) In the end, the movie did have a lot of flaws, but those flaws is what made me enjoy the movie(from a Idintreaddabook perspective). more than what others are saying. Come on it's not That bad. Hey Critics, this could be another twilight movie.... where we can hate it but at the same time can be a guilty guilty pleasure (secretively). And The Lovely Bones is that (for me at least). B+",The Lovely Bones
364,colinmatts,pretentious drivel,2,21 February 2010,"So they got a popular novel, persuaded the Lord of the Rings director to come on board and even assembled a very impressive cast. Then, the movie happened! But, I firmly believe that nobody watched this mess before inflicting it on the public. For the first fifteen or twenty minutes there's a glimmer of hope that it might just be going somewhere. The specter of a middle American happy family is just about cozy enough to pull you in. Even the fact that the narrator is dead doesn't altogether unsettle the optimistic viewer. In fact, one is reminded of Kevin Spacy's character narrating ""American Beauty"" from beyond the grave. We know, pretty early on in the story, where the plot is heading and what the cute teenager's fate is going to be. Enter the most stereotypical pedophile in movie history. Stanley Tucci's character lives alone, sports an anorak, wears a very false looking mustache and glasses. He's overweight and has lanky hair parted perversely. He's the kind of man the police would investigate just for looking like a nonce. Now, most modern teenage girls would run a marathon if this man even turned up on the t.v. So let's give Saoirse Ronan's character the benefit of the doubt and say that in the 1970s youngsters were probably more trusting. The movie is set in 1973 after all. A fact the film makers only elude to when it suits them. Anyway, she agrees to go down into a sort of underground camp with this gruesome pervert and the obvious happens. Except it doesn't. In the book, Susie Salmon (Ronan) is raped and killed. But there is absolutely no illusion to the sexual motive anywhere in the film. Apart from the fact that the murderer looks, talks and behaves like a sexual deviant, there is no ripping of clothes or attempts to seduce the teenager. It just looks like a motiveless murder, or it would, if we got to see the murder taking place. Sadly this whole scene is shot in such a shoddy way that you might be forgiven for thinking that the girl actually manages to escape from her attacker. I'm thinking that director Peter Jackson didn't want to emphasize the sex and violence of the attack, given the fact that his leading actress is only fifteen. So, why not use a more mature actress? Once we actually establish that Susie Salmon is dead then you might imagine that the movie becomes a tale of tracking down and bringing her killer to justice. Well, it isn't really. Because now we are entering the world of CGI heaven. I have read one review of this film that likens it to spending two hours in purgatory. The murdered Susie Salmon is not quite a ghost and not exactly passed on. She dances around in limbo making friends with other murder victims and periodically checking back in with her living relatives to see how her murder investigation is going. Back on Earth, her parents are separating, her sister is playing Nancy Drew and her grandmother is cleaning the house. Perhaps the most astonishing thing about this film is the fact that an actress of Susan Sarandon's caliber agreed to such a pointless role. A cameo in ""The Simpsons"" would quite honestly have read better on her C.V. Mark Whalberg is unconvincing as the father on the edge of a nervous breakdown and Rachel Weisz, as the mother, looks like she couldn't care less. Rose McIver gives a watchable performance as the murdered girl's sister and one wonders if she wouldn't have handled the lead role more maturely. As if all the above wasn't bad enough, there's a teenage romance and first kiss subplot to really have you reaching for the bucket.",The Lovely Bones

To sum it up shortly: A considerable amount of (acting) talent hopelessly lost in a very uninspired sequence of slow-motion scenes featuring the oily After Effects creations of a 10- year-old on acid.I felt eerily reminded of that insufferable Robin Williams flick, ""What Dreams May Come"". And that even stood out in comparison.What's really sad is that there has been quite a lot of talent wasted on this piece of crap, especially in Saoirse Ronan, Rachel Weisz and Stanley Tucci. They do their best to make up for the lack of coherence, esprit, and dialog in the script, but ultimately fail as any actor would have. I feel almost as sorry for them as I feel for anyone who decides to waste two hours of their precious life time on this the King Kong of Kitsch.I give it two stars only because I felt a slight tingle of suspense during that scene near the end, when the sister slips into the killer's house.It would have been only one otherwise.Please, Peter Jackson, make another hobbit movie soon.

What I didn't like about the film is that most of the characters are kind of one dimensional, even the main character Susie seems kind of flat. And the neighbor/gay psycho killer didn't really do it for me either. He wasn't very convincing to me as being the killer of young girls (maybe little boys). He had the creepy vibe down but I couldn't help but feel like it would have been better to have another actor play the part...preferably one that actually looks like he would go after young girls/women or perhaps someone who wouldn't have looked the part like Bradley Cooper or Ryan Gosling...the unusual suspects.I also wished they would have given a bit more background as to why he went after young girls. And their justice wasn't satisfying enough. I was hoping he would have been caught and beat to a bloody pulp in jail and died that way but at least he did die a horrible death although the fall didn't look natural.

Those people with a devotion to the book should always exercise caution when approaching the movie re-imagining but I think Jackson has a record for getting at least one rather large novel onto the screen pretty well and seems to be trustworthy here. What this movie shows again is an ability to balance supernatural material within earthy and otherwise naturalistic settings and I am not sure Jackson has a peer in this respect.The acting is fantastic and the restraint shown in the ensemble scenes is really commendable and something that many other North American directors should consider in their own future outings.For all that positive reaction though I must say that I found many scenes very confronting, disturbing and, I think pretty challenging from any point of view that balances an ethical perspective with an artistic one. So whilst there is restraint the material for an emotional impact is certainly there. I left the cinema feeling a weird combination of wonder, sadness and not a little anxiety.Recommended",The Lovely Bones
371,apvizion,A sloppy mess,3,26 June 2011,"Having never read the book and hearing very little about the movie, I had no idea what to expect. Within the first 10 min. I was feeling pretty good about it and felt as though someone may have gotten the whole ""trapped in the in-between realm"" concept right for once. Unfortunately things quickly unraveled as numerous glaring issues began to arise with the tone, plot and characters.The first big issue was with the tone and the odd way in which the movie would jump from feeling like a creepy serial killer flick to feeling like a magical Disney-ish romp and then to a dark comedy at times. It felt as if three different writers (and perhaps 3 different directors) were contributing portions of the script who had three very different ideas of what kind of movie it should be. In addition, the aforementioned writers obviously did not communicate with each other, or even read the others' scripts. The second big issue was with the plot, which felt as confused and inconsistent as the tone. The movie was full of foreshadowing and set-ups that were forgotten or simply came to a dead end for no apparent reason or benefit to the overall story.The third major issue was with the character development. I never felt like I was able to connect with any of the characters enough to be moved during the scenes where the movie suggested that I should be. The characters would seem to make odd decisions that made little or no sense and a lot of their motivations were not made clear.I was amazed at how sharp of a nose dive this movie made after what seemed like a pretty promising beginning. I was still trying to convince myself I liked it till around the mid point where it really started to come apart at the seams. By the last 10 min of the movie I was astonished at what I was seeing and could not believe how bad it had gotten. Was this the same movie that I had started out watching?

Never gave much thought about those kids you see on the milk cartons or catch a caption of from time to time on news reports. Mostly because I never knew anyone who had a family member who was a victim. However, after seeing this movie it kind of brought an awareness to me of what's going on out there. Maybe because I feel like I know someone who it happened to through getting to know the little girl and her family in the movie. Probably not the intention of the movie, but I left with a feeling of awareness. I wasn't at peace with her going to Heaven in the end, that part was the Hollywood ending. For me the message was public awareness, as odd as it might seem.",The Lovely Bones

Watched a couple of ""Making of"" programs about it and to tell you what, I was looking forward to it. I didn't know there was a book but I was really interested in the idea - paedo/murderer kills a girl who then helps her family catch him.........well that what the trailer said.........I must have missed that part of the film!?!?As for the film - some fantastic actors but all where left with nothing. Was the guy a paedo? Don't know. Did the mum have a break down? Did the dad do anything? What about the police? Why did the sister get drawn to that house? Why would a boy who didn't even go on a date with the girl be pining after her over a year later.........what about the girl who can see ghosts.Seems there where many characters there just none where developed in anyway.The best way I could describe this film is.............nothing..........nothing really happens. Well you have a 30minute murder mystery with 1hour and 30minutes of CGI ""heaven"".Final words: Good idea, terrible let down.",The Lovely Bones

I had never heard of the book but saw a glimpse of some early imagery of Suzie in the inbetween that I found captivating.In the months leading up to the movie I had seen lots of negative reviews and I think I prepared myself to be disappointed - this didn't happen. I found the movie moving and well acted.After watching the movie I then went and read the book to get deeper into the narrative. Books are not movies and movies are not books, you could never hope to include everything from the book in the movie.Excellent acting from all - I do agree that Rachel Weisz was underused but she still added weight to the story even if you had to read the book to really understand her character.

376,chser453,As good as could be expected from PJ,9,3 October 2011,"If you are the sort that cant get beyond their base preconceptions, you'd be better off not watching this movie - Don't expect this film to be a ghost/horror story, or a serial-killer crime thriller ( quoted from another reviewer ""It could have been a really good detective story with the 'ghost' helping solve the crime"") - it doesn't pretend to be any of these things. Obviously there's a few reviews here that show up a lack of understanding of this, and theyd be better off sticking to the standard teen-slasher horror fare.The exercise is to create viewer empathy for a young girl whose life is tragically cut short in brutal circumstances and how her family come to terms with it in her eyes. Granted Jackson doesn't give many of the characters much opportunity to really develop but the young irish teen Saoirse Ronan in particular succeeds in earning the audiences empathy especially when she fulfils her return to her true love on earth, for her one last short-lived time.My main gripe is with the excessive and ultimately contrived use of CGI for the other-world setting, i don't think the movie needed it to tell the story - but with Jackson at the helm it was predictable in todays simplistic audience requirements. Certainly the movie version could have been produced more faithful to the book and therefore better, but Jackson wasn't the director for this.And certainly don't expect it to be as good, or as comprehensive as the book ( personal drama adaptation movies rarely are) but as a package the compelling story, the excellent ambient musical score and the handful of strong performances that make you want to care about the outcome of Susies story, whatever it is, make this worth a watch",The Lovely Bones

We have examples of that ever since movies based on books and even legends started being made.If you cannot accept that this movie is the work of those behind it, with a base story (the writer gave her permission), then do not watch it.If however you can appreciate a beautiful story, a beautifully made movie with breathtaking scenes, scenes that makes you wanna sink into a hole and cry as well as scenes of pure joy, then watch it. I have read the book, I have watched the movie...just as with Lord of the Rings, I can appreciate one work, AND the other.To those not liking the CGI and therefore discarding it...why? Do you not paint pictures in your head when reading a story? What is wrong with making Susies world beautiful in a way it couldn't possibly be otherwise? How can you for example watch the last scene with the victims coming out of the light and only go ""Oh my goodness, I hate CGI!""....? No, this is a beautiful movie, it is made differently in many aspects from the book but I can tell you right now, the book is still here. All can read it and love it..I for one, am glad they didn't put everything into the movie. It didn't need to be there, not for me who has read the book, not for those I know that hadn't read the book before they watched the movie.Watch it with an open mind and open eyes, watch it for what it is.

378,thedrmat,The biggest cinematic disappointment of 2009...,3,10 January 2010,"I recently watched THE LOVELY BONES, inspired by all the hype that surrounded the film prior to its release (being Peter Jackson the director and all) and, in part, to see why exactly many people were bashing it so cruelly. I have to say that the detractors couldn't have been more right!! I haven't read the original novel the film is based on, but, throughout the film, I had the feeling that there was, hiding somewhere, the potential for a marvelous movie experience which ultimately got crushed, diluted and swept away by the choppy handling Peter Jackson and his team had of the source material. Coming from the creator of the masterful LOTR trilogy, one would have expected a lot more. But, alas, the movie ends up being a convoluted, pointless mess. It doesn't work neither as a thriller, nor as a family drama, MUCH LESS AS A FANTASY-SUPERNATURAL EXPERIENCE A LA ""WHAT DREAMS MAY COME"" -which tackled the afterlife topic with far more sense and maturity-. Not even the oh-so-overpraised turns by the always great Stanley Tucci (more of a presence than an actual character here, but for which he has scored some awards and is being considered for the Big Ones anyway) and Saoirse Ronan (so much superfluous CGI around her won't allow to appreciate how incredibly talented this young lady is!!) can truly save this dud from its inevitable doom.The saddest thing about it is that the movie is not really balls-out-bad, just VERY BADLY HANDLED; had they adapted the novel in a steadier direction and focused more on the human factor, things would've turned out quite differently. So, like I said, this isn't necessarily the worst movie of 2009 (although I can smell the Razzie nominations coming a mile away), but, instead, just the biggest disappointment; two very different concepts.I give it a 3/10 (and more for the visuals than anything else, although, after a while, that also had me saturated!!).",The Lovely Bones
379,SpiritedAngel,Simply breathtaking,10,12 July 2012,"Honestly, at first I wasn't that interested in this film. One of my friends had seen it and she didn't like it at all and she kept going on and on about why she didn't like it, and it put me off seeing it. Which, is a tragedy. But I can happily report that I have now seen it (obviously, or I wouldn't be writing a review for it :P) and I'm only sad I didn't watch it sooner, and that I let my friends judgement of it cloud my own thoughts about it. First off I want to say, that the cast is amazing! Saoirse Ronan is the perfect Susie, exactly the sort of girl I pictured when I read the book. I was a little dubious about Stanley Tucci being the killer - I've only ever seen him play 'good' characters before so I wasn't sure If I would be able to see him as anything but that, but boy was I wrong! He plays the character of George so well, that by the end I was cheering when he died! I was furious when he managed to get away with dumping Susie's body in the sink hole, and I thought that when Susie 'possessed' Ruth or whatever she did, she was going to stop him or get Ray to call the police. I kept thinking 'Girl, you need to sort out your priorities!' Although to be honest, Reece Ritchie is cute, and what girl wants to die without even being kissed once? The part with all the murdered girls reuniting made me cry. Its like, even though this terrible thing happened to them, they still have people around them who understand what they are feeling. I had a feeling that Holly knew more than she was letting on. All those times that Susie looked back, Holly knew how she was feeling because she probably went through exactly that when she was killed. looking back now, there are times that she looks like she wants to tell Susie, but she holds back - like her last scene with Susie in the gazebo. All in all, this is one amazing film, from the cast and the acting to the directing and the special effects, which were truly special. I would recommend this film to anyone who loves a good mystery, but also anyone who likes tear-jerkers.",The Lovely Bones

I haven't read the book.I have just seen the film and i really liked it a lot!It's a beautiful sensitive film,full with human emotions and there is hardly a cliché in it.The between world ,the girl is in, is a nice vision of what a 14 year old girl would think spending in after she just brutally murdered and can't except her sudden death and taking away from her familie and new blooming highschool love.Don't you get it? The serial killer,portrait nicely by Tucci,i one of the scariest characters i'v seen in recent cinema history,kudos for Tucci playing such a part!All actors are wonderful,the music by Brian Eno is dominant but affective,and Peter Jackson's direction is sublime.

381,monkeyjb1988,What's with the hate?,8,13 January 2010,"POSSIBLE SPOILERS I went to a screening yesterday for this film with my mom. After reading some of the reviews, I thought I was in for a mess, which would have been sad since Peter Jackson is one of my favorite directors. However, the film was pretty good. The story had heart, showing how the family were together in the end to help each other. I also thought Susie's role in the film was great, being the catalyst for her father's search for her. There was a little bit too much of the CG world, but it wasn't that bad. They were very nice, which in itself serves to show how people have to learn to move on. The cast did a good job in the film, especially Mark Wahlberg, Saoirse Ronan, and Nikki SooHoo. All in all, unless serious re-cutting was involved between when earlier reviewers saw this film and I did, I don't know why it's hated so much. I never read the book, so I don't know how it compares to the movie. My mom thought it was weird, so the best I can offer is give the movie a chance before bagging on it. You may be pleasantly surprised, like me.",The Lovely Bones
382,oliraceking,"Lovely Bones is a challenging experimental film - remind yourself cinema is an ART form, not a McDonalds",8,20 February 2010,"I went to see The Lovely Bones intrigued by the anger and universal dismay towards this film. I did indeed leave the cinema angry and dismayed, but solely at the bigoted and the spoiled- brat critics who were vocally competing to see who hates it the most. I found the film interesting, arresting and daringly experimental. I haven't read the book, but just because I haven't doesn't mean my defense of this film is invalid. To me, the audience for this film is clearly 13 year old girls. It was told from the point of view and emotional spectrum that encapsulates pubescent girls, and it seemed very credible to me that shifts in tone would exist, such as the family drama dealing with loss; a soul entering a Technicolor fantasy world; the humour of a drunken grandmother taking control of the household.....The crux of the problem to me is that audiences in general (and middle aged, middle class critics in particular) HATE films that don't conform to their notion of genre, convention or tone. As much as they berate films that fit the so-called McMovie mold (i.e. Chris Columbus films), they are in fact guilty of prejudice in berating films that don't fit within their own academic-brow window of film-making: they want their own kind of McMovie which fits within a McGenre, using McConventions with consistent McTone. If they are DARED to be served up something experimental in this Happy Meal, they throw a hissy fit and wail at top volume about how much they hate it (like Radio 5-Live's Boyd & Floyd recently).I recently heard a recording of Alan Parker berating film critics, and for good reason. But in that same lecture he spoke of his dismay that at the time less than 1% of the population had watched a foreign, i.e. subtitled film. So, as he argued, audiences were only interested in seeing movies in their own language, about their own culture, and using techniques that were familiar. I equate the reaction to The Lovely Bones to this narrow minded, childish and self-satisfied approach. Decisions that Peter Jackson took in the adaptation were just that: DECISIONS. Rather than simply dismiss them as WRONG, why not challenge yourself to submit to his ideas, and take or leave what you want. Many criticise him for depicting the afterlife (crucually NOT Heaven) so clearly. Well, fine! That's HIS vision, HIS imagination, HIS choice. I found his choice totally befitting with what I imagine a 13 year old girl in the 70's could concoct. The evocative Brian Eno score, when juxtaposed to these images, did create a sense of the fantastical which completely offset the drama or the tragedy. And good for it. It's a stream of consciousness, it's not a McMovie with extra high brow.People criticise Jackson for injecting fantasy elements into The Lovely Bones, clearly an influence from his LOTR experience. But no-one criticised him for including horror elements in LOTR, an influence from his first phase of work.... To me, the wonder of cinema is that CHALLENGES you, either emotionally or thematically - or, as in the case of The Lovely Bones, with style and juxtaposition. I am so grateful that Jackson, untrained in the academia of film school or film flatulence that most critics are, made a film that was so experimental; a film that had a 'Fountain' like stream of consciousness, a film where the inner soul of the character did exist throughout. Behind the mixture of styles and ideas was the aura of a 13 year old girl. Jackson was the best actor in this movie, he played the role of Susie Salmon as well as his lead actress!",The Lovely Bones
383,ad-mckinnon,Jackson Has done it Again!,9,16 June 2012,"(Spoiler Alert)The Lovely Bones is a movie about life and the after life through the eyes of a 14 year old girl named Susie Salmon. The movie is the first that Jackson has done since King Kong (2005) he has been producing and writing this and various other projects (District 9,The Hobbit)since then. The Lord of the Rings took everybody by surprise, the world loved it. Then he had to prove himself with Kong and succeeded again. The Lovely Bones is another success in my opinion, Peter Jackson tends to make movies in a very classical way whilst manipulating the audiences emotions like no other director. He does this through sincerity, he is very honest. There is a no B**l S**t approach to his productions, a quality possessed by no other mainstream film-makers (with the exception of C. Nolan). Like all of his other films The Lovely Bones is something we have never seen before in terms of a visual and emotional experience. It has a lot of grand landscapes and vistas that we often see from Jackson however the interest from the audience is engaged from believable story and characters. Death is a common theme with Jackson's films but he clearly feels that as sad a topic it is and as upsetting a topic it is, he creates ultimately uplifting movies, without being cheesy or contrived.Of course not all of the credit belongs to Jackson, the writing is brilliantly well adapted from the beautiful novel by Alice Sebold and the casting though questionable paid off. Mark Whalberg did a good job of stripping off his action hero status and becoming the grieving, sensitive father, and on top of that having to compete with the performance that could have been. As I'm sure a lot of people know Ryan Gosling was the initial choice to play Susie's father and due to disagreements about the vision of the character dropped out of the project and Mark was his replacement. I think we can all agree that Gosling is a much more creative actor than Whalburg but Mark did a fabulous job as his replacement. Much like Viggo was Mark's replacement for Aragorn ( I know can you imagine?) A beautiful film, with a powerful message. Now lets see The Hobbit Mr. Jackson in 2012",The Lovely Bones
384,Karolinnu123,Great characters and interesting storyline,6,6 January 2011,"I decided to watch this movie although I read some not so good reviews. There where some things in the movie that caught my attention. I thought that the beginning of the movie was great, it was light-hearted and fun. It was good to watch the happy family life. About the film in general, I found the special effects confusing and tiring. Also I didn't understand why was she always in the pavilion. Other thing that caught my attention was the connection between the plot summary and the actual movie because in the summary it is said that she will help her family cope with her death but I didn't really see that. For comparison I would bring the movie ""Ghost"" (1990) where the title character literally got his revenge and helped his girlfriend move on. About the actors -- I think Stanley Tucci presented his character well, it gave me jitters how creepy he actually was and Saoirse Ronan has the most beautiful eyes and I really liked her as the happy bubbly kid. I give it 7 out of 10, because it was quite confusing in some places and I really disliked the special effects. I would have liked if they would have kept all the action more down to Earth (not to consider the fact that she was in Heaven). Oh and there was this small and insignificant thing said in the film that most people wouldn't notice, but the fact that Clarissa's father owns a restaurant called Surf 'n' Turf was funny for me because my aunt happens to work in restaurant with the same name, only in Norway.",The Lovely Bones

You see the story in a special way, from the girl, Parents, Classmates and even the killer's point of view. You'll feel all the pain the girl and parents Felt (not the physical) you'll feel the evilness of the murderer. The story also goes beyond the world and tries to show things about the beyond.

386,Wasp-12-21-11,Disappointing,5,31 January 2012,"I first discovered the novel of ""The Lovely Bones"" after watching the trailer for the film adaptation and was instantly interested. I read the book before seeing the movie and was stunned, long after the final page - it remains a favorite of mine. I was excited to see Peter Jackson's take on the story, but was let down.The story of a teenage girl murdered by a sociopath neighbor in suburban 1970s is mixed with clichéd images of an ""in-between"", which include girls wearing disco clothes and dancing on vintage records. Some might find the opposing themes even each other out, but instead it made the film a tiring experience of switching genres.It was not the story that annoyed me - after all, I was perfectly fine with Alice Sebold's novel - but more of the execution of it all. Peter Jackson aimed to make the film suitable for teenagers (which I was when I read the book and saw the film), but in doing this he took away the real emotion impact of the novel.Not a terrible film, but never-the-less a disappointing one.",The Lovely Bones
387,Screen_Queen,As Close To Living Up To The Book As It Can Get – Give It a Chance!,8,12 January 2010,"I did, and I was very pleasantly surprised. I had waited a long time for this movie and had high expectations for it, especially since the novel is one of my favourite books. But then I had to lower them a bit after reading all the negative comments about Jackson's use of CGI. Am I the only one who enjoyed and loved it? I admit he could have made it less dramatic towards the end after the denouement, but I understand what he was trying to achieve. He took the novel's main themes and tied them together using the CGI – ravelling and unravelling them in accordance with the characters' lives. What he was trying to represent is that sometimes there are higher forces governing our thoughts, our desires, our paths. Sometimes we are unable to control the things that happen to us and the people we love because these things are bigger than what we alone have to face. And sometimes, even in the face of something ugly and horrendous and destructive, there is something beautiful waiting underneath it all – and though it is fragile and delicate beneath the destructive forces, it is something that can always be fixed if it's broken. It's human connection. Or, as Susie says, the Lovely Bones.Susie's heaven is not meant to be of this world. It is meant to be her own world, at the same time nowhere and everywhere at once, made up of her own feelings, thoughts and desires. I loved Jackson's use of CGI to depict this, because its use in itself is symbolic – Susie's world is something of the imagination but at the same time real, the place in-between, and Jackson's use of CGI is not to flamboyantly embellish the details of the story but to simply depict this, and to directly contrast the scenes of Susie's family, which are at once grounded and emotionally raw, real and cathartic. The difference between the natural and the preternatural also serves to emphasise Susie's lasting connection to the temporal – that even though she was part of a world that was disconnected to the one in which her family remained, her connection to her father in particular drew the two worlds into alignment. So Jackson's, and ultimately Sebold's, message triumphs: that love – even through death and separation – survives, and that people, with it, can learn to move past the loss and grief, but not without further appreciating the things and people around them, and move on. Jackson's CGI played an important part in communicating this message and so it deserves its place in the movie and makes it worth watching.The performances in this movie are very worth mentioning too. It doesn't happen often that one can view multiple award-worthy performances in a single film – but it happens here, with the fantastic performances of Mark Wahlberg, Rachel Weisz, Susan Sarandon and in particular Stanley Tucci and Sairose Ronan pulling the film along strongly and accomplishing more in this single movie as actors than most can in numerous ones. Where the CGI calls upon the audience's opthalmic sense, it is the performances that enable one to really feel the characters, the story and the tone of the film. I am very grateful towards, the casting director, because I could not have asked for better actors to fit or portray these characters.So, my conclusion: go see it. At worst you will see a tragic but beautifully told tale of a family's fight for answers and understanding in the aftermath of devastation. But at best, you will come away with a significantly memorable experience that will break your heart and mend it beautifully.",The Lovely Bones
388,scatter_brained4,Fiction captured on film,10,8 February 2010,"This movie was just so lovely. Yes, it's about a murder committed by a phyco path so it may not be anyone's cup of tea, but I love the whole fiction of it all; going somewhere in the in between after you die where everything is perfect until your ready to move on, from being able to connect with your loved ones like the main character did with her father. Some people didn't like the film and claimed the director didn't care, but he was simply brilliant from the beginning to the end. His message is that life should be treasured. It, after all, started with the narration of the young girl already being dead which reminds me of another work of art American Beauty from 1999. The movie focuses on letting go, not the suffering of the family and that made me feel something. The movie ended with the narration of the murdered character speaking directly to the audience.

It has been a long time since I have seen such an unusual movie. full satisfaction to the eye, very artistic, very beautiful! but also very interesting. good combination this time.

391,Master_Prophet,High Potential...Flawed Execution.,5,2 January 2010,"Here's a promising film that turned out disappointing. Before you read any further, understand that I haven't read the novel that this film is based on, so forgive me ahead of time if I'm a bit ignorant to specific details that center around this story. Fourteen year old Susie Salmon is a happy girl, the middle child of three, and a promising student. She's just your typical fourteen year old girl, interested in a certain boy at school and the things that girls of this age are interested in. Problem is, her neighbor across the street is interested in murdering her, and that's exactly what happens. Now she's stuck in the ""in between"", a world between Heaven and Hell where she can see everyone down on earth but can't really communicate with others. I guess my biggest problem with this film is that from knowing the very little information about this film and novel as I did before watching this, I guess I imagined a much better film then what was panned out. Peter Jackson's a terrific director and he's given us probably the greatest film trilogy of my generation in ""The Lord of the Rings"", but this is a story that could have used a little less CGI and a little more fleshing out of characters. The actress that plays are main character, Saoirse Ronan, does a fantastic job with what's she's given, however, you've got a great actor in Michael Imperioli, and he's completely wasted in this film by being given nothing. He's only in a handful of scenes, and he's made to look like a complete idiot. Again I haven't read the book, so if that's how the cop is in the book, then I apologize. Susan Sarandon shows up as an estranged grandmother, and does an excellent job for a bit, but again her story and background aren't fleshed out enough for us to really care. Mark Wahlberg and Rachel Weisz do fine as the parents, but again it's a complaint with no material to go around. In fact the only true performance here that I felt was captivating, was that of Stanley Tucci, whom plays the serial killer neighbor. His actions and emotions speak the world of his disgusting character, and he's almost unrecognizable in this role. You really grow to hate him during the film. However, the over emphasis on CGI technology and not enough on story and plot make me unconvinced of this films potential during the awards season. Not even close to the worst movie I've sat through, but not close to the greatest either. It's just average.",The Lovely Bones

So, as my summary states, I did find this to be a deeply affecting film, as sensitively handled as Heavenly Creatures. Indeed, I found this to be an often heartbreaking experience, with deeply felt performances delivered by the cast, especially by Mark Wahlberg and Rachel Weisz. Stanley Tucci's killer was creepy and felt all too frighteningly real. I found that the depiction of the afterlife (or the ""in-between"") to be full of wonderful images, though one brief sequence was jarringly off, as was one brief sequence involving Susan Sarandon as the grandmother. So, as I said, I found this to be a good movie that moved me closer to tears, and more frequently, than any other film that comes to mind (then again, I am 53, so maybe it's just not coming to me).",The Lovely Bones

It is a crying shame they were not given a script which would allow them to make better use of their obvious talents. I read Alice Sebold's novel and although I realise that a film has to cover a large amount of ground in a short amount of time, the ground covered was superficial.

You will try to make an extreme art. but you forgot that its not only you who's gonna watch the film. But still its an extreme art but beyond a common man's reach. I loved this movie but I cant tell my friends or suggest my friends to see the film because I have a doubt that whether they will like it or not. this movie is for only limited viewers. the great movie is not that at what level you go but a great movie is that how far you can go with the masses.

398,lordjin,"This is a great, great, great movie.",10,30 April 2010,"I'd like to preface my review with a comment about the negativity circulating around here about this movie. I don't think it's any coincidence that some of these self-appointed ""film-making experts"" who have nothing remotely positive to say about Jackson's effort cannot formulate complete sentences. It's not surprising at all that someone obsessed with the wetness of a prop in one scene and its dryness in the next lacks the faculty and capacity to appreciate the many merits of this film. It's ridiculous to knit-pick on 'unrealistic' depictions of this aspect of day to day life or that aspect. If you want a realistic depiction of day to day life, observe the world around you, not a movie screen.The Lovely Bones is being unfairly hammered as maudlin drivel. Some of the concepts and visuals are on the representational side, but if you take this film as a strange amalgam of a murder/suspense thriller and a fantasy in the vein of a children's book, it all works perfectly. The emotional outpouring is portrayed very well by all the players involved. None of it seemed forced. I became emotionally invested early on and the overall impact of this work struck a chord in me that resonated deeply.More than anything else, this film is unique. Jackson takes many chances when one considers all the traditionally accepted conventions of film making, but unless you are one of those self-absorbed, self-important film student types who endlessly struggle with the ""rules of making good films,"" you'll get something out of this.The use of CGI was adventurous to be sure, but if one views this piece as an interpretation of life, love, and death through a fantastical lens, then the effects remain harmonious to the telling of the story. More, the CGI in this case describes 'world's unseen,' metaphysical possibilities existing simultaneously without the bounds of physical space and time. A welcome departure from space ships and crumbling cities. Some of the nastiest complaints about the CGI are coming from people who probably have no problem with giant robots that transform into cars and trucks.Acceptance of a fictional story, the suspension of disbelief, these events occur in the relationship between a movie and its viewer completely apart from all the rules of pacing, subtext, and all the rigid pigeonholes that don't really apply to the creative process anyway. I did not find the Lovely Bones to be maudlin, and I am a pretty jaded movie-viewer.",The Lovely Bones
399,Jayalltheway,Loved it!!!,9,14 September 2010,"You can't argue over taste so I won't, but when for instance Inception gets the credit it does and this movie gets cut in half I really don't understand any of it. I thought it was simply beautiful in every sense of the word. Yes there was a great use of CGI, but it was never disturbing to me. I thought it was beautiful to use it for something other than big robots to name but one example. I haven't read the book so maybe for some that could be an issue as it is more often. But in itself as a movie it stands out of a lot things I have seen in quite some time. I missed the love of filmmaking I felt here in for instance King-Kong. And after part 2 of Lord of the Rings I got bored. The actors are great, the story is gripping, I felt tension which I don't feel that often anymore and the moral is a good one. God bless Susan Surandon, her part was a little to small, but damn, what an actress. I read that Mark didn't get on board till the last moment but it had to be that way. I didn't dig Rachel Weisz that much, but than again, I never do. And a very special mention to Stanley Tucci and Saoirse Ronan, both of them carried the movie to lonely heights......lovely heights.",The Lovely Bones
400,HonourableJudgeReinhold,"Visually Stimulating, but Lacking Heart",7,1 March 2010,"""The Lovely Bones"" sets an example for a creative concept, but it is executed poorly. Jackson was the wrong person to direct this film. He is entirely swept up in the story of catching the girl's murderer, and he seems to lose interest in the afterlife of Susie, which comprises the most stimulating and inventive scenes in the movie. Jackson brings an imaginative visual style to the scenes involving the journey to heaven. The design of Susie's personal heaven presents a very artistic and visceral experience. This film is undeniably well made, and the actors should really be commended for their devoted performances, including Wahlberg and Weisz as Susie's parents and a very notable role from Stanley Tucci as Susie's killer. A lot of work and effort was put towards this film to create a unique story that is somewhat controversial. The film should be applauded for that reason, but for a film that tries to take risks, it goes in an awfully mainstream direction. The film falls into a murder mystery story instead of studying how the family copes with death and Susie's afterlife journey and acceptance of her own death. Creative scenes are balanced out with horribly cliché moments. The film would be much stronger if it had cared more about its characters instead of using them as puppets toward visual style.",The Lovely Bones
401,das_leichsi,an amazing experience,10,24 April 2010,"I just watched the movie last night and I was blown away by this. I was touched deeply by the performances and the art Jackson made out of making this movie. I don't want and will not talk to much about the movie itself, cause it's a beautiful story well told and it's intense till the end. What I want is to defend this movie against all this nutjobs around. I always read about the CGI and that it was so misplaced and that Jackson is always going for this. Guys, you noticed that this movie was a lot but not an ""eye catcher""? the most important and touching sequences were in the ""real"" world. the afterlife was like it should be, larger than life, colorful and not as stained with our everyday bullshit. I liked the CGI sequences and I was surprised that he kept them at this few. but everyone's still complaining. Enjoy the movie. if you want to go off about to much CGI get back to LOTR (I can't understand you're rating this one so high when it is nothing more than CGI and Tolkiens 2dimensional characters) this movie is highly enjoyable for everyone who likes a film that makes you feel instead of just to watch. the slow pace of the story is a minus, but the cast is playing this one away like nothing. it's ""fun"" to watch them and it left me crying for a while. watch it, but only if you are capable of emotion. if not you wouldn't like it and see it as a waste of time and money (yeah I was talking to you)",The Lovely Bones

I have not been as emotionally affected by a film as much as I was by this since Steven Spielberg's, Schindler's List. It, and its director Jackson, deserve much more credit than it has received up to date. It was a truly actuate depiction of Alice Sebold's novel which should rank as one of Jackson's best as well as one of the best films of 2009.

The audience became engaged in the most appropriate places such as the corn field and the scene when the sister was in the house.The movie despite knowing from the onset the main character is murdered had lighthearted, funny, and poignant scenes. Stanley Tucci is utterly creepy and a friend of mine didn't realize it was her favorite character from Julie and Julia.The movie itself reminded me of atonement in the sense that it was extremely quiet dialogue but I was so captivated that I didn't realize the length of the movie. It is a must see and those I attended the theater with informed me Peter Jackson and the writer did the book justice.And to those who disliked the CGI, I don't believe we were watching the same movie.

409,ukkid35,Heavenly Creatures?,7,20 February 2010,"Perhaps most people think of King Kong or Lord of the Rings when they see Peter Jackson's name, but I suspect the movie that says most about his sensibilities is 'Heavenly Creatures'. Like 'Lovely Bones' this movie depicts the tragedy that befalls two young girls, but sadly Lovely Bones lacks the incredible depth in his earlier movie. This is not the fault of the actors, as they are all excellent, despite the Stanley Tucci character seeming such a cliché. Surely no child would spend any time alone with someone who appeared so incredibly slimly, their innate aversion would stop them instantly. In fact the abduction scene is incredibly difficult to watch, even though there is no violence at all. Apparently the source novel has an extended rape/murder scene, but this was entirely absent from the movie which was an excellent decision. However Peter Jackson didn't shy away from depicting the heavenly after-world which unfortunately reminded me of Aronofsky's The Fountain (also starring Rachel Weisz). When Susie Salmon arrives in the after-world and meets Holly, she never asks Holly 'Who are You?' and that made no sense to me. Susie's strange behaviour wasn't the only frustrating aspect of this movie, I think the main problem is the uneven tone; part thriller, part fantasy, with individual scenes working superbly, but even Susie's narration can't immerse the viewer in her world - unlike Kevin Spacey's narration in 'American Beauty'. Perhaps that's because I'm not a 13 year old girl.",The Lovely Bones

411,Dogwhiz,Tries too hard to be many things without developing a good focus,4,15 August 2010,"The Lovely Bones is quite a complicated film that can best be described in quite simple terms: a cinematic mess. Perhaps unfair expectations were placed upon the project because of Peter Jackson's past work, but his effort on this one seems to be considerably less apparent. Nearly everything about the film's structure and execution seems to fall apart at some point and almost the only thing about it worthy of significant praise is its vivid and colorful visuals, which don't even seem to fit in or provide much purpose to begin with. And in the end, sadly, this film, that originally seemed like it had such potential, ends up virtually nowhere and leaves the viewer considerably unsatisfied.The story is a unique tale of a young girl's murder and the aftermath, including her family's subsequent emotional breakdown, her father's relentless search for the murderer, and her journeys through the odd, colorful limbo she's trapped inside of until both she and her family willingly move on. The story is accompanied by quite an impressive cast and crew list. As mentioned before, Peter Jackson directs with his usual writing crew- Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens- who took on the responsibility of adapting Alice Sebold's 2002 novel of the same name. British breakout star Saoirse Ronan plays the protagonist, 14 year-old murder victim Susie Salmon. Mark Wahlberg plays her obsessive father, Stanley Tucci is the creepy and deceptive killer, Rachel Weisz plays Susie's mother, and Susan Sarandon takes on the role of the eccentric grandmother who provides comic relief in the way she manages to down at least one sip of alcohol in almost every scene she's in.And while the story is certainly unique and the cast list makes one hopeful, something just doesn't go right in the execution of it all. The pace jumps around far too often for the viewer to keep up, the tone never seems to officially establish itself and stay consistent in any way, and the dialogue is simply dreadful at times. The acting potential was certainly present and Saoirse Ronan, Wahlberg, and Tucci all seemed to provide strong efforts, but they received no assistance from the script whatsoever. In fact, the consistently bad dialogue and frequently changing atmosphere seem to bring down the performances and make everything seem too over-dramatic– an unfortunate result of such potential. As a whole, the film just seemed to try too hard to be too much.The film's focus is all over the place and at certain times, within a span of just five minutes, it might switch between the perspectives of three or four different characters. And while the film is certainly long enough to take on such a feat of presenting multiple important characters to the audience, it never quite manages to do so in a substantial way. Instead, the movie ends with none of the several major characters completely developing and the audience walks away with no true care for any of them. And this is perhaps the film's biggest problem– it never does appear to know just what it is trying to accomplish. Even if it does prove to be even slightly emotionally engaging, it's not without odd and out-of-place scenes every other couple of minutes. Focus frequently switches from Susie Salmon's fantasy-like encounters in limbo to her father's desperate attempts to find his daughter's killer to the comedic acts of the grandmother to the sudden dramatic breakdown and exodus of the mother. Perhaps the editing is partly to blame as well, but it's hard to believe that a film crew can't find a way to use 2 hours and 16 minutes to evolve and develop a couple of characters without throwing too much at the viewer in each couple of minutes. It seems half-hearted and incomplete.Adding to the jumble and confusion, each character's short-term and long-term conflicts seemed, at times, unclear. In fact, much of the time our supposed ""main character"" spent her time standing around in the beautiful limbo that's been so carefully crafted (perhaps too carefully), not doing anything apart from giving narration that sounds like poorly written spiritual poetry from the Victorian era that eventually amounts to nothing and seems like filler. In a similar fashion, I think it's fair to say that the entire movie came off as a pretentious ""artistic"" film that no one understands and that the filmmakers are apparently too brilliant to have to clearly explain. One may argue that the audience isn't supposed ""to understand"" it all. ""But the audience is supposed to experience Susie's confusion and share her feeling of being lost"" is not a valid counterargument. There's a fine line between captivating the audience with a world of wonder and majestic daze and leaving so much unexplained that causes them to lose interest out of boredom and confusion. And if you ask me, on top of all of those flaws, the amazing and vibrant visuals of Susie's ""in-between"" serve no purpose but to provide some indication as to where $100 million went with this film's production. Although I haven't read the novel, I have heard that these colorful landscapes do help to capture the tone of Sebold's story.But Peter Jackson overuses them to the point where they simply seem out of place- as if their repetitive appearances were only meant to charm the audience into a false feeling that the film was somehow improved by them (*cough* Avatar) and to act as a constant reminder that Jackson's team knows how to use their computers (and if you saw any of the Lord of the Rings films, let's face it, you already knew that).In the end, The Lovely Bones is just a mess of plenty of things that could have amounted to something but never really do due to lack of focus and development. Peter Jackson and his team should stick to epic war battles and dramatic tales of world danger.--The Motion Picture Underground",The Lovely Bones
412,painbros22,How to kill off a movie.,3,6 December 2011,"The Lovely Bones is a difficult film to watch, but not for the reasons you may think. The subject matter is very dark, taken from a very deep but very disturbing novel. Its meant to be uplifting but its an impossible task for a movie that disconnects the viewer so early on. The problem here is the character of Suzie is just far too lovable. You are literally enchanted by the character straight away, but this person is going to die at the hands of a vicious serial killer. When you know this the human mind simply disconnects from the horror, anything Suzie does after her death is moot.Imagine owning the cutest bunny ever. When you are given the bunny you are told that within a week its going to be slaughtered and served for your tea. Wouid you love and care for the bunny knowing its going to have a horrible death ? Or would you simply disconnect to save yourself the pain of the inevitable ? Thats the problem with the Lovely Bones. Because of this disconnection from horror the viewer simply gives up on anything else the film may be trying to get across.Alas what the film tries to ""get across"" is very unclear. There is nothing uplifting about brutal murder. Yet Peter Jackson simply does not know what kind of a film he is making here. Its an uplifting film about heaven and serial killers ? its a grim tale about murder, despair and teletubbies ? Jackson plays it safe with subject matter that was never meant for a tween audience, yet the movie seems to pander to that very audience.

She eventually has to decide which is more important, revenge or letting her family move on.I've always liked Peter Jackson and respect his work but this movie wasn't as good as a lot of people were expecting or hoping for. It's never easy to satisfy everyone when turning a book into a film (though he did quite well, I thought, with ""The Lord of the Rings"") and that is one of the problems here. Saoirse Ronan's performance was the strongest in the movie and probably Oscar Nomination worthy. The rest of the cast was so-so and Susan Sarandon's ""comedic relief"" was too unnatural for the emotional atmosphere Jackson seemed to be going for.The movie is quite emotional at times and very suspenseful at others. I don't want to dive into spoiling too much but I was gripping my seat in the final scenes. The story teaches an important lesson too: moving on. It also contains some wonderful visuals as to be expected from someone like Peter Jackson.Overall the movie tells an interesting, emotional, and suspenseful story that is sure to become a favorite of many.

But 2/3 through I started seeing where it was going and I was bored and angry I'd wasted my time watching at all. By then I was so disgusted I lost that time of my life for this. Don't waste your time. The Movie looks great and there is a great cast, but that's it. If I really thought about the meaning of the story it's actually disgusting that somehow if you find your way out of purgatory to inhabit someone else's body to have sex then you'll be satisfied enough to go to heaven even though your murderer is still free and your body has been hidden forever, never to be discovered. Why on earth did anyone think this was worth of making into a movie to retell this is beyond me. What a waste of good acting talent and filming. They totally got the 70's down pat. But the reason I see movies is the storytelling and where it goes. This one went into the bizarre and completely unsatisfying off the side of the road direction.

420,georgechristophert,Better to light a candle than to curse the darkness,7,15 September 2010,"After watching this film I came straight here to investigate what other films of Jackson's I could enjoy. The film was exceptional in my opinion. I never read the book, but I found that the themes were communicated powerfully and effectively without over too much use of language, highlighting perhaps the transcendent aspect of the film.The CGI were gorgeous and inspired in me visions of the sacred. The whole film seemed to juxtapose the utter ugliness of the rape and murder of the 14 year girl with the presence of a power in the universe and in our lives that not only exists in spite of such wretched acts of abominable will, but also is capable of bringing forth goodness within and around such situations.One powerful example was after information was discovered that would prove the killer guilty, as the daughter rushed this information home, at the moment the audience is excited for the impending justice, she stops as her mother stands in the living room, who came home after going away for some years, seemingly coincidentally just at that moment. This highlights the theme that love, the love in a family, in spite of this tragedy, is more important even than justice being carried out on the murderer.In the end it is the same situation, the chance for Susie to taste that perfect love was of more value than the prosecution of the murderer.I think this theme is poignant, and if the book contained it, that must be why it was so well-received, aside from being well written. This theme is that: we ought focus not so much on the utterly horrible acts that certain twisted human beings do commit as on the reality of divine goodness, on the presence of love and that which is of actual value in life, that which exposes the treacherous as being such, for it is for these values, for love, that we are meant to live, and that power is ultimate and reigns supreme over the temporal evil in the world. This theme is so relevant because in our time we tend to focus so much on the awful things that happen in the world, and it can give one a bleak view of Reality, make one doubt the existence of real spiritual goodness, of love, of heaven, but this story teaches us that not only are these things real, but they are enduring and far more powerful than the evil that we see, no matter how gut-wrenching they are when they happen. We need to not let our hearts and minds become consumed by the hatred of that which is obviously evil, destructive. We should consider: why do we hate it so much? Because we know it is not the way. The way is love, goodness, wonders that we all desire but which are hard to believe. But yet they do. It is because these wonders exist that we so hate the rape and murder of children, the light of God exposes them. Since that is what we really want and need, it is more important to dwell on the light and explore all the goodness the universe has in store for us than to curse the wretchedness of the world, for in doing so we take on the way of the cursed ourselves.",The Lovely Bones

There are also a few truly inspired sequences, such as the manner in which Peter Jackson presents Susie's murder as well as a climactic scene in the killer's house.Its drawbacks include mostly uninspired acting and what I can best describe as an overall lack of focus. The film jumps around quite a bit, both in time and in tone, making a connection virtually impossible.

Some remarkable effects...some strong acting, especially the young victim, but oh, my gosh, don't pile it on. A cleaner telling of the story would have saved it. There's such a thing as overworking a theme, and then there's sentimentality where the filmmaker twists it a little harder to get emotion out of the viewer.

Only the other daughter has depth, but it becomes pretty predictable. Okay, haunting, haunting images. I'll give it that. I'll probably have nightmares for a week.",The Lovely Bones
424,mbarry219,What a pile of crap!,2,23 October 2010,"How could two people turn one of the best books I have ever read into this garbage? This movie took a book about grace, redemption and living, really living, and turned into a film about the great outdoors (yes, nature is beautiful) and a bunch of pointless special effects sequences produced by people who obviously wanted to work on Inception.I mean, did the screenwriters even read the book? The book was full of the people who survived Susie and how a mother/father/sister/grandmother could actually survive a death like that. The person her sister becomes is fascinating. Was that in the film? No. When Susie (in the film) says she is filled with hate I almost shrieked. THAT was the point of the book -- somehow, she (and those who loved her) managed not to be. And maybe I should reread that book but there is no detailed rape scene; yet another amazing thing about the book was how Alice Sebold wrote about a brutal and violent event without having to write a detailed rape scene. Again, I cannot imagine the screenwriters actually read the book.The heaven Alice Sebold described was an interesting place, about PEOPLE (not dream sequences), which is what heaven really is about isn't it? People talk about heaven, not animals or some all-powerful being that everyone agrees on. The book gives a picture of how heaven could be about what people really desire and how we live and die.Susie didn't go morphing through fields of gold or running down California beaches -- can you imagine reading that? I read this book shortly after it came out and the characters still stick w/ me, whereas I was bored in this movie -- when I wasn't being disgusted.",The Lovely Bones

Stanley Tucci is without a doubt one of the most talented actors out right now. I've never seen him in such a role, and he played it with perfection. The young actress (star ""Susie"") was also fantastic. Mark Wahlberg...I like him, but his brother Donnie, definitely got the better half of the acting gene. That's not to say that Mark is not talented. Everyone else...eh...My problem with the flick though is how do you turn an explicit, rated restricted novel into a PG-13 movie? Well, you can't and shouldn't try to. If Peter Jackson had an issue with being dark, and yes, even sadistic, he shouldn't have taken on the movie. Leaving out many of the key points in the book was the movie's failing point.(*SPOILERS AHEAD*) Leaving out the actual murder and some scenes regarding it, were key to me, at times, being confused. No one wants to see a 14-year-old girl killed, but TOO much was left up for interpretation and didn't need to be. These things were clearly described in the book. The book was suppose to be over a 10+ year period, and yet I got the feeling that everything was happening in the matter of days. Leaving out the significance of relationships formed - the sister's love; the mother's affair; Abigail and Jack's marriage falling apart; George Harvey's childhood and relationship with his mother. None of this was in the movie, and it made the story seem (at times) all over the place.I definitely would not oppose a different director bringing this novel to life. As a matter of fact, I kind of hope that someone does...at some near point down the line. Much like they did with The Hulk. Perhaps then its length will make much more sense.",The Lovely Bones

If you have been unfortunate enough to catch more than 30 seconds of any of the Twilight mistakes and multiply the awfulness by 10 then you will be getting close to how terrible this film truly is. There are no redeeming factors. The acting is terrible. Worst of all the girl who plays the main character is terrible. I suppose you can't overly blame the cast considering the terrible screenplay.

Disjointed barely covers it, and watching Marky Mark flounder all over what would have been the pivotal role if cast differently, is facepalm worthy.The girl is the best actor among them and she barely has anything to do but look forlorn for 2 hours. Tucci is decent, although the whole plot is blown wide open 10 minutes into the movie so his presence is pretty trite when it should be menacing.Susan Sarandon plays it well, but her character has SOO many quirks that it's hard to find a human center in her.The plot is even more obvious than you think, and the narrative flow is all over the map, not to mention the time frames involved are really hard to figure out.I'd give it a 6 out of 10.",The Lovely Bones

I was wrong. It's over two hours long. It's veeeeery slow. It's veeeeeery boring. It has a veeeeeeery bad ending. Albeit, it does have nice effects and landscapes, but in general the story is very boring. It has one good scene that we've all seen in many other movies where a person sneaks into the killer's house while he's away, but then he comes back home while the other person is still inside.

I have never been one to take others opinions too seriously, but tis hard to ignore the vast amount of negative reviews this film is getting. I myself found it to be very enjoyable, and find most peoples complaints about the film to be baseless. There are an awful lot of people complaining about the editing and the jumping around, the lack of distinct characterization and the plot jumps, but the way i viewed it, that was entirely the point. We have a story being told from the point of view of a dead girl in the space between heaven and earth. She is telling a story that is not really about her, and definitely not about the other characters in the story, but more about life and how life was affected by her disappearance and murder. The entire point was that those people in the story were holding on to pieces of her in there hearts, and they had to let that go, just as she had to let the pieces of them go. So to me, had it focused more solidly on any one character, or even more so on all of the characters, it would have become the dads movie, or the moms, or the killers, or even Suzies, and that would have destroyed the point. At least that was what i got from this film, and in turn, though not a perfect 10, i feel this was a great film, and i feel it truly succeeded in almost every way it needed to.So to me, it seems that a lot of people have just kind of missed the point, which i guess is the risk and artist makes in presenting something that is non conventional...",The Lovely Bones

The film ""The lovely bones"" directed by Peter Jackson was mad in 2009, Featuring Mark W. The plot of the film focuses on life or death of a 14 year old girl named susie. The theme of the film was that death of someone can affect and leave a big impact on those left behind. The main characters were Susie (protagonist), Lindsey(sister), George Harvey (antagonist), Jack (father). The main conflict of the film was character versus self because the film revolved around Susie before and after death, she didn't know how to let go. First, George plots for Susies death and succeeds, Susie is confused and stuck in the afterlife. Next, Susie tries to contact her family, She watches her dad get beat while he was trying to find her killer but he very unsuccessful. Lastly, Susie & Lindsey (sister) make great discoveries. Susie meets the other girl George murdered and is finally not alone. Lindsey finds evidence that george was the one that murdered her big sister Susie. At the end of the film ""The lovely bones"" by Peter Jackson. Susie goes to a better place, her family moves on and find happiness and George dies a tragic death.

437,PaddyReagan,Insightful and Unsettling,8,25 October 2010,"Prejudice is one of the greatest spoilers in our lives. It damages relationships, sends innocent men to prison, it influences choices in the marketplaces we frequent. Reading a book and dozens of reviews beforehand is the surest way to prejudice attitudes about any movie. I brought my own prejudice to The Lovely Bones. As the father of a 14 year old daughter any movie featuring the brutal death of a child is sure to tear my heart out. As such, Bones made me suffer through a tragedy that every family dreads.After reading many of these IMDb reviews after the fact (I've still not read the book) and comparing the impressions of others with my own thoughts and responses, I find myself wanting to defend the movie and its telling of a heartbreaking story.It as a story told by an innocent--a 14 year old, small town girl. She had not been seriously kissed, was still more child than woman, and possessed only vague ideas and impressions of life and what comes after. Her innocence and curiosity led her into the corn field and to her death. But, to us, her audience, her spirit flitted away, into an imagined world, into a blue space from which she could see but not be seen. This fantasy universe seemed incomprehensible to many who saw the film, offended by so much ""CGI"". But how would you perceive this middle-ground if you were 14? How would you construct the metaphorical space in which this transition was taking place? Hints were present everywhere, the lighthouse from the bottled ship, the gazebo where she was to meet her potential first love, the drawing with its blue space—recognized by her brother as her temporary home. From this lush purgatory, she watched with a breaking heart as her family was crushed by the reality of their loss.Bob Dylan's recurring phrase in ""Like a Rolling Stone"" was ""how does it feel?"" That's the unspoken question I ask as I watch any movie. Can the tenuous collaboration of writer, director, and actors influence the cynical, hard hearted, over-exposed to media, information junkie that I've become? As I watched The Lovely Bones I felt tight-chested fear for my own children, identified with the bitter angst of a family who had lost so much, and hoped the daughter sitting beside me wouldn't see my tears or at least understand why they existed.While I could have done without Sarandon's awkward mother in law and asked the same logical questions (where did he put the two tons of dirt in the corn field/why did they move the safe a hundred yards instead of moving the car), I will never forget the crushing reprise of neighbor Harvey's criminal past or the passage of all those murdered women with lives left unlived.I've wondered how parents of murdered children cope with such an event. Bones only amplifies that question, magnifying the depth and impact of emotions. While the ending demonstrates irony more than vengeance, the real story is closure—that happiness is only possible when sadness ends.",The Lovely Bones

I really loved how the scenes with the living worked out, despite a few times when the order of things got changed around. The only part that really bugged me about the Earth scenes, were the ones with Ray Singh. Why didn't they cast an actor who's actually close to the age the character's supposed to be?Negative: The Heaven scenes were completely messed up. People seem to be complaining about the amount of CGI used in ""Heaven."" It's not the CGI that bugged me, it's the content of it. She's supposed to be in a stable place, especially near the beginning. Not in a weird place that changes with her emotions.I generously give this film a 7/10, because I think the movie really appeals to the people who aren't familiar with the story. The friend I went with, who didn't read the book, really enjoyed it. It's worth seeing if you have no interest in reading the book.

440,anders-rapp,Childish and incoherent but with great actors,3,20 March 2011,"This is a children's movie which is a little strange since it's a brutal story about murder. The mix between the adult story about a serial killer and the fairytale about someone playing in their own fantasy creation once they're dead but haven't yet ""moved on"" doesn't come off well. It's confusing and unbalanced. It gets to the point where it's just effing irritating. It's also filled with out of place and fist handed metaphors that fits well in a children's story but...it's just bogs the movie down and makes it slow and boring. The same goes for the heavy sentimentality with bright lights, pretty flowers, and the many many many shots of people-slowly-turning-their-heads-to-look-at-someone.A young girl whose name is Lindsey dies but doesn't move on so she can watch over her family. In the afterlife she meets an Asian girl called Holly who serves as a substitute for the audience. At one time she even EATS POPCORN as they look at Lindseys family together!!!!! Holly explains things about being dead to Lindsey. But Holly is heavily retarded. When Lindsey watches her sister kiss a boy for the first time and Lindsey cries when she sees this Holly says...""I don't understand! I thought you'd be happy?"" This movie is rated PG-13. Does the director think all 13 year old kids (girls) are this stupid and needs things spelled out like this??? Also, we know the creepy killer is creepy because he does creepy things like stand completely still in doorways for no reason and stare at people in cars as they go by.So what's good about the movie? Well it's always nice to see Rachel Weisz in a movie. She does what she can with the material but she's far too talented to be in this crap. Mark Wahlberg is pretty good here as well. But the crown goes to Susan Sarandon as the alcoholic, chain smoking grand mother with puffed up hair and, at first, no sense of reality. She's awesome! The music is pretty good and there are a few endearing moments that work well. Also a very tense and exciting segment when Lindsey's sister tries to uncover the truth.The director of this movie is Peter Jackson who also did ""Lord of the rings"". Remember how the last 30-45 minutes of ""Return of the king"" was packed with over the top sentimentality? Well this movie is very similar to that...only longer. The movie is not a complete waste of time. It's just that we - the audience - deserves soooooooo much better than this! :-)",The Lovely Bones
441,markquinn1989,Wait.... hang on a minute!!!!,8,23 February 2010,"I just saw The Lovely Bones today & having let it set in I thought it was a tremendous film!!! OK, I'll admit that Peter Jackson tried a little too much to overpower the film with CGI but that does not take anything away from the heart & emotion this film can generate. Firstly the acting is absolutely superb with fine performances all round. Saoirse Ronan (from my homeland - Ireland) is a revelation as Susie Salmon. I have yet to see such a gifted piece of acting from such a young actress since Natalie Portman in Léon. She has been robbed of a nomination for a truly Oscar-worthy performance. Rachel Weisz, Mark Wahlberg, Susan Sarandon & of course Stanley Tucci (one of the finest supporting actors in modern times) are all convincing here too. I believe that when the nay-sayers saw the level of CGI they lost interest & forgot what this film can really offer you at its core - tension, heartbreak, thrills & joy.If you really make the effort to delve into this film, you will come out with a tear in your eye. If not, then I pity you for not being able to look past the CGI blunders & see a really emotional film.",The Lovely Bones
442,kat25121986,Not as good as the book,2,22 September 2010,"For the first time since Twilight, I decided to read the book prior to seeing the film and unfortunately that's where the problems with this film begin. Anyone who has read the book will notice that the time-line is completely different. for example, in the book Susie's mother leaves after her husband attacks Clarissa (not before) and doesn't return until he has suffered a heart attack after arguing with their son, Buckley, who we rarely see. (The heart attack isn't even included in the film.) The majority of the last six or seven chapters with everybody she was at school with growing up is avoided and it skips to Susie's ghost possessing Ruth when she's fully conscious (again a major rewrite as Ruth had been knocked down by Mr Harvey's car and left for dead). There are so many flaws with the film that it would take an age to list them all and considering how much I loved Peter Jackson and co's working of Lord of the Rings, I have to say I was extremely disappointed with his version of the film.",The Lovely Bones
443,paul_klein94,Uneven casting but all round wonderful film,8,7 July 2010,"Just first off, i have read the book twice. I love the book. it's my second favourite book of all time after American Psycho. Just, so you know I know what i'm on about.As far as directing goes, Jackson does a good job. He's still got a flare for humans as well as effects which we can see in everything except The Rings (which i dislike for being boring despite looking amazing and having some of the best actors ever.) But, when it comes to casts Jackson has always put a crown on his head for brilliance then pulled an arm off with ignorance. Thinking of the Rings. You see how brilliant his cast is. Viggo Mortensen, Ian McKellen, Hugo Weaving, John Rhys Davies, Christopher Lee and Cate Blanchet are all brilliant actors. Then he puts in Liv ""large mouth small voice"" Tyler and Orloondo Bland and ruins everything. The same goes with King Kong. Jack Black, Andy Serkis (in both roles) and Jaimie Bell are amazing. Always have been always will be. But then in comes Naomi ""average at best"" Watts who screams and thinks thats fine and Adrian Boring giving his worst performance since The Pianist (which will always be awful to me).In this film we have a similar issue. Despite effects looking very childish (it is the heaven of a child so it works in my view.) The cast get by. There are moments of pure gold with the likes of Stanley Tucci (who should have won the Oscar. Even though Waltz was amazing too). Who comes on and scares you. Ronan never lets him steal the show because she can act through anything and is always brilliant. Michael Impreiolli is good as the cop who needed more screen time like he gets in the book. And Susan Sarandon hams it up as drunk granny. These four performances keep the film on track as far as the storyline goes. They capture the book perfectly. Then we have average Rachel Weisz who is beautiful but far to young looking for the role of over-the-hill mother of three. The role suits Maggie Gyllenhaal or Kate Winslett. And Mark Whalberg (who is unfairly billed on the poster first). He's too young, too slim, too long hair, too no bearded and too boring as a dad. Turst me, if a daughter died, you'd be more angry than just smashing bottles. More tears? The role should have gone to Liam Neeson with a beard maybe, Alec Baldwin or even Gerry Butler.All in all. The film is good. I loved the book and hummed for the film. I did see it four times to hum at it. If you like the book this will be half and half. If you haven't read the book, this would be a good start or even a good film in general. Just ignore Marky Mark's performance on the way out.",The Lovely Bones
444,minky-mark,"Very ""Different"" Movie",5,24 April 2010,"Calling this movie dumb, stupid, or unrealistic would be incorrect. However, it is very different from most other movies that are out today. The overall concept was far fetched and some parts were more interesting than others. In my opinion, a lot of things could have been changed to make this movie better and more entertaining. I spent half of the time wondering what the heck was happening. It took me a very long time to figure out who was dead. It was very confusing how there was earth and then an in between place. Sometimes I didn't know which was which.Some parts probably could have been taken out of the movie and it would have made it a ton better. When Susan realized that she was free, her and her friend danced around in the inbetween place for close to 15 minutes. I thought that was unnecessary and a large waste of time. Not to mention I began to wonder whether the creator of the book was intoxicated during the creation. Also, there seemed to be so many events/items that were supposed to represent something in real life. I was sure that it could relate to something, but i could never figure exactly what it was. The movie was very confusing and a lot of things needed to be cleared up.I did like some of the stuff in this movie though. Almost everything not involving the in between world was pretty good and entertaining. I could stay focused and entertained through that part. But once it went back to susan and the other world, I slowly drifted away and got confused again. If there were more of the real on earth stuff, the movie would be a lot better. The whole Salmon family was very good. The variety of characters and reactions to the death were fairly realistic. The ending killed it. After a 2hr movie, i didn't understand how he managed to die because an icicle the size of my pointer finger. A mass murder, doesn't get caught but instead dies because of a melting icicle. I had a guess that the icicle represented him getting denied for the first time, but im not sure.",The Lovely Bones
445,emily_contact,"Nothing worse then a movie with it's moments and great acting, but was so poorly executed. In fact, you could say they executed this one with a chain saw!",2,2 March 2010,"To put it into better terms: This movie had it's moments. There's nothing on the surface that you couldn't give it an Oscar for. I felt that the actors, production designers, costume designers, lighting and sound engineers all did their jobs very well. Not to mention it's one of the Peter Jackson movie's I've so been looking forward to after Lord of the Rings, which was so astonishingly wonderful (I hated King Kong).I thought they took what seemed like a great idea, and screwed it up by having a commentary by the dead girl. The reality of a family that has been through the likes of what Susie's family would have been going through had it been real life, would have been insurmountably more terrible then anything that a child, after being killed would have felt or remembered. I also hate films or even books, but in particular films, which somehow make most of the movie surrounding a characters narration, when the narration isn't needed, or even worse: When that character has no affect on the outcome of the story. Susie's thoughts and feelings are irrelevant to us after she has died. Just as the dead, even if they were ghosts would never bring an outcome onto those who are living.I also thought that the main massage being that of forgiveness was a weak one the way they played it out. Again, I would like to stress that in reality, weather you believe in an afterlife or not, once you are dead,not much of anything that happened before will matter to you anymore. On the family though? If they had made this movie about the parents thinking they were going nuts, and frantically trying to solve the mystery of who the killer was, and focusing on their struggles to ever ever forgive a man who took the life and innocence from their beautiful daughter...now that wouldn't have just been a good movie..it would have been a great movie! But of course they would have had to have addressed the real darkness and demons within the story...which is a messy business. But then again, this movie is too dark to show to most kids anyway. But I can't name many adults I know that would have actually enjoyed it. Adults, and especially parents know or at least understand the meaning of sorrow and loss. And true forgiveness is to face the suffering, the consequences of your or someone else's actions, and to move past it, and begin anew. It does in no way mean, letting the killer get away with it all, or pretend like nothing ever happened.I've never read the book. Some books just don't translate to films well, this must have been one of them. But having said that, I like all of the actors they chose, and thought the casting was magnificent! If you find this on DVD to rent at a cheap price, it's worth one watch, just for the ending sequences!",The Lovely Bones

I can't explain how excellent Saoirse Ronan was in her portrayal of a victim or how captivating Rachael Weisz and Mark Wahlberg were as parents in this film. I certainly can't empathize with Stanley Tucci in his role as the villain. I can't tell you because I can't get past one thing...The topic is so vile.This was a movie that rips your heart out as a parent and offers no explanation as to why it was made or any socially redeeming value other than to profit those who made it. I'm not negative because it was poor film-making. Au contraire... it was an exceptionally well done piece on an extremely controversial topic. Peter Jackson (Lord of the Rings) obviously put his abilities to work here in an attempt to tell the story. The problem is, there is nothing entertaining about this topic. Even Jackson's decision to tone down some of the parts to make it more 'audience-friendly' weren't enough to make this palpable to any parent.To profit from this movie, then celebrate it with critical acclaim and awards... well, that just confirms the negative perception I have of movie show-business.

449,annc1,The worst film I have seen in living memory,1,8 August 2010,"Perhaps I am just very selective about the films I watch, but The Lovely Bones has to be the worst film I think I have ever seen.It could have been a really good detective story with the 'ghost' helping solve the crime, but it became a wishy washy mish mash. It became so irritating that I had had to switch off the DVD ten minutes before the end, I just wanted it to stop! A cross between a Cadbury's Flake advert and a really bad soap. I thought a Peter Jackson film would be better, but it seems not.The performances are mediocre to say the least, some too painful to watch, why was this film ever made?",The Lovely Bones

I could agree about the scene where Lindsey returns home after getting the sketch book from the murderers house, that it was odd. But it is only odd for people who haven't experienced anything like that. I also haven't, but I can imagine that after her sister being killed and then her family partly falling apart, that she would be very surprised seeing her mother after apparently a very long time. Yes, personally I think a person running away from a murderer would scream like hell, but sometimes it's impossible to get just one sound out when you're afraid plus she fell on her back and lost her breath. I've had a dream like about 15 years ago that I still remember, where there was some kind of monster, but when it saw me, I couldn't scream. That was a dream, but that also happens in real life. Also I can't say that I understand why exactly, when Salmon (Susie) came back in the strange girls body, why she didn't stop the murderer from destroying the evidence - her body in the safe. OK, yeah she had never been kissed by a boy, but - really? All in all, I would never say that this is the worst movie ever made, like one guy said in the comments (has he seen Little Miss Sunshine?- that is just awful). It takes great understanding and concentration to feel it properly. I don't believe that people who haven't had a great loss like that, can ever truly understand those who have. The movie was good.

Main character is haunting in her beauty, her clear blue eyes [ looks like a Cusack ] Plot itself is put together like a mosaic, a puzzle wherein the pieces don't fit exactly, but has to be applauded for a creative way to tell a depressing story. The characters that represent her infatuation and his new interest are barely developed. We don't know if they are good or bad, and their presence as the trunk is being 'tensely' sent to its final destination,is pointless. We never see what is in that trunk.

Apart from the fact, that I struggled to make it through the crime description even though it was not very developed. In the movie, the factual scene was only touched upon in a very gentle way, which I am grateful for, because crimes committed on children are extremely and truly disgusting. However, I can't fight the feeling that it was not the core of the plot, but only a trigger. It is a complex matter of spiritual world that the history revolves around. Perhaps, it attempts to answer one of the many rhetorical questions of all times: what does it mean to be gone for someone who is gone and for those who stay?Speaking about differences, I can remember so very well, that in the book a main character's sister went through a rebel phase and had her hair cut short, like a boy. Also, it wasn't only a kiss that her ghost sister observed her doing, in amazement. What is more, wasn't she supposed to meet her grand-grandmother while she was stuck in her perfect world, between an earth and heaven? About the movie ending there was some director's imaginative solutions implemented, I believe. While in the book the plot seems to be left somewhat unfinished, there is a merciful Karma giving the audience feelings of justice and relief in the movie.Susie Salmon, like a fish. Probably the first of the Saoirse Ronan's mature creations. Saoirse won my attention in 'The Host' movie and as soon as I realised accidentally that I've seen her before in a brilliant 'Hanna' movie, I knew I would explore her achievements to date. Saoirse is Irish for 'freedom, liberty'. The actress is very likely to reappear on my screen several more times as I am currently under her spell. She obviously is talented and I expect to see her ascending in her career.It was at least the second time, that I've seen the movie, so I lack 'a first impression'. I believe that a fresh look at things has the strongest impact. The thing which I won't forget about this movie is how some people knew or could feel, that she was still around and who was responsible for all that. This hunch, which got them searching relentlessly and kept them hanging on to the case of a missing girl until the day of redemption. Did they get their closure?

456,reuben-18,Avatar meets Heavenly Creatures?,1,16 February 2010,"A main character of a film should have some purpose in being there, and I think that is one of the main failings of The Lovely Bones. The subject of the story, a murdered 14 girl, acts mostly as a narrator - which makes a lot more sense as a first-person literary device than it does in a visual context (which is told through the eyes of a camera rather than a specific character). Its easy to pick out a movie adapted from a book: They are usually heavy on the narration, due to the screenwriters temptation to transpose internal monologue to voice-over. Unfortunately narration really only works well when it contrasts heavily with what happens on screen, in an ironic manner; anything else tends to come across as heavy-handed.Heavy-handed sums up Jackson's directing style fairly well. While this may work in low budget B movies, such as Jacksons earlier works (Bad Taste and The Frighteners), when it comes to an intimate study of grief and strain on a family after the loss of a daughter, overblown CGI scenes of the candy and bubblegum-teen-fantasy afterlife are really quite jarring, and completely unnecessary interludes to the story. I wonder if, after having built up a large visual effects company for the creation of Lord Of The Rings, Jackson feels he must make use of CGI at every opportunity -- no matter how contrived. It is the more standard thriller scenes which are most effective here.Remember the incredibly ridiculous glowy pillow fight ending of Return of the King? Well imagine that popping up in the middle of a normal film every ten minutes, and you get an idea of what the numerous heaven scenes are like within the context of The Lovely Bones. It reduces the narrative device of a heavenly observer to a gimmick... Conflict is necessary to make a scene interesting, but Jackson wastes most of the afterlife scenes with skipping girls and giant floating things.However, it is the ending which is the worst and most obvious flaw. All tension that had built up between the main characters was ignored, and instead we have all the most pointless characters in the entire film eating up the last few minutes, along with the bad guy, who gets away (kind of). Peter Jackson should not be surprised that this didn't go over well with test audiences. Instead of a bad guy/good guy showdown, we have a kind of karmic philosophy lecture to try to tie things up. This would be hilarious if it was a deliberate parody of the expected showdown ending of an action movie: The action hero dies horribly, but he comes back as a ghost and says to everyone ""hey don't worry, its okay, because my death brought everyone closer together"". Then everyone could hug, and then the bad guy could burst through the wall and slaughter everyone. Unfortunately this movie has no sense of humor (although there is one montage joke about the mother being not good at housework, it goes on waaayyy too long and becomes merely irritating).Jackson seems content in sticking with his contemporaries Tim Burton or George Lucas, who fill sub-standard scripts with annoying visual extravagance. Its a shame.",The Lovely Bones

I haven't read the book so I don't quite exactly know how accurate the film is to the book, so my review will be based on from what I seen. The whole film was so emotional and deep. And I admit it, I did cry numerous of times. The cast for the film was well picked and Saoirse Ronan acted so well as Susie Salmon. I can not give this film enough credit and it is definitely in my top films of all time. Even the styling of the cast was spot on!The part when her sister found out he was the killer was great and so tense. The ending almost made me mad because obviously we thought he got away with dumping her body. But he don't exactly get away with it as we see him plunge to his death off the cliff but I think anybody watching the film probably wanted a even worse death for him. However I wasn't disappointed with the ending, the fact it made me mad he dumped her body but then we see his death, was great.

461,troyzeinstra,"Quite Disappointing, but not awful.",6,20 March 2020,"The Lovely BonesWhen first seeing the short material of trailers and advertisements about this film, I was very excited. However, what appeared to be the next step in cinema ended up being a disappointment. When I started watching The Lovely Bones I expected to see a very dark and grim film about child rape and murder, while also looking at the psychological aspect of losing a child from the parents' point of view. What I got was a fantasy ride, showing the concept of something existing between life and death. The film follows the story of a young girl, Susie Salmon, who is murdered at the age of 14. Her spirit gets stuck between life and death, which gives her the ability to see what people's reactions are to her untimely death. It shows the father of Susie Salmon, portrayed by Mark Wahlberg, who is desperate to prove the murder of his daughter.
The film stars Saoirse Ronan, Stanley Tucci, Mark Wahlberg and Rachel Weisz, who all give stellar performances in their respective roles. Saoirse Ronan portrays the 14-year old Susie Salmon, a naive girl who gets murdered by George Harvey, portrayed by Stanley Tucci. Tucci was rightfully nominated for an Academy Award for this role.
Despite the flaws in the story, the film was well directed by legendary director Peter Jackson and it was also brought to life by the beautiful score by composer Brian Eno. The cinematography in this film is of the next level. The beautiful frames which create astounding screencaps make this film generally satisfying to watch. The visual effects and sound mixing departments give this surreal place a nice edge to make it whole.
Overall, the story could have been better. I would've liken the film to be more realistic, as the whole fantasy aspect completely ruined parts of the film for me. The visual effects were good, the sound editing and mixing was great, the soundtrack was amazing, and of course, the acting was really on point, and it lifted this film up in the air.
I would recommend this film to people who are getting into dark films, but are not ready for too extreme things yet. This is a ""lighter"" version of a dark film. I'd also recommend this to cinematography lovers.
For casual moviegoers, this might not be the film for you. The story is quite long and it may be a little too slow and cryptic for some people.
Thank you for your attention.-Troy Zeinstra",The Lovely Bones
462,mayft,What was the point? was this made solely on the purpose to show how much Peter Jackson can do with CGI?,5,10 February 2010,"This is so unlikely that it is insulting.This was one of the lamest epilogues I've ever seen in a movie maybe the worst ever! It was so bad I got out angry and frustrated. It felt like Jackson and his all crew of writers and co-producers (whom I used to admire) looked down on the viewers as if they were fatuous candid dumb people.I mean, how might this even most remotely be? Here are three scenes that utmostly ruin it all.1°) The sister of the missing girl has ""the creeps"" about an odd neighbor. So she breaks into his house, where she finds evidence that the odd man actually killed her missing sister. He notices that and chases her down. She manages to escape though he was close to catch her. And then (while he might still have been chasing her) for i-don't-even- know-why-or-what, after she reaches home, she just stands there, open- mouthed, because her mom finally got home after leaving them to grieve on her own. She doesn't tell what she knows, until and ridiculously long moment, after her father had shown how much relieve and happy he is to have his wife back Come on! Is this really to prevent a fragile return to happiness in the family that she held such an important information for... i don't know... too long anyway!?? Moreover, the scene cuts where she finally gives the proof to her grandma, leaving you wonder what happened. We can see, for a rdiculously short shot, the police at the killer's house after the ""family would-be so beautiful reunion"", but the man seems to have escaped so easily?! How come? A dangerous man is out there, and you waste time like that? how genuine is that?2°) And what about the odd girl, who ""can see things""? She saw the missing/dead girl while she was already gone... but never use that information in any way. What was the point in the odd/psychic one seeing the missing/dead one if she could not tell it to anybody or the family or police to take some kind of benefit of it? Even at the dump nothing happened at all! Even there she won't tell she could see the missing girl; nor the missing/dead girl who knows now for a fact that the odd one can see her, she won't tell her who killed her in order to have him stopped from further murders... Again what was the point in them to have this contact/connection they have?3°) Finally the death of the killer... My, oh my! this was insulting, literally insulting. That was lame, so lame!The casting was more than good, their performances was very much good actually (left aside Susan Sarandon and Rachel Weisz characters during the grieving process, who both were not quite moving, if not rather irritating or... just unlikely). Visual effects show real achievement in art direction and CGI. But there's no storytelling here, no actual plot.

This was done intentionally, as I wanted to see the film as a stand-alone rather as an adaption. Thankfully I was pleasantly surprised at the way the film made me feel. I was engaged and found myself, on several accounts, a part of the film. While there are many who believe that the CGI scenes were distracting and ruined the film, I think it was a pleasant break from what is a rather thematic and at times depressing film.I can say that as a stand alone film this is a stunningly presented and a well acted out film. Let me compliment Peter Jackson on his transformation from huge scale films to this focused and personal film. They way the film was presented to the audience was not confusing, however if one is a person that wants everything in front of you, this is not your film.There were times when my friend would ask 'How did that happen', or 'What happened there?' It is the subtle messages that are brought through that captured me. Despite what critics have said about Susan Sarandon's 'taking over', this was far from the truth in my opinion. I felt that, while it was a comical role, she played it excellently.Overall, I felt that this was a fantastic film on its own. Peter Jackson has once again proved that he is not restricted to one genre and can adapt and evolve into a fantastic director. Once again, this film is not for anyone looking for a fun, light-hearted movie experience. There are times where it is difficult to watch.

466,JohnTruby,The Lovely Bones,7,15 December 2009,"Spoiler alert: this structure breakdown contains details about certain events in the story.I didn't want to see The Lovely Bones. I liked the novel. But the thought of having to watch the rape and murder of a young girl seemed unbearable.Turns out I was wrong. You don't see the rape and murder. Far more important, the film has some deeply moving moments that brought home for me the true tragedy of the loss of a single human life, and that was the result of choices the screenwriters made. Ironically, those same choices dictated that the film was not as strong as it could have been.Adapting the book posed several story problems for the screenwriters. The book has multiple story lines, which are easier to interweave in the novel medium where you don't have as serious a dramatic urgency as you do in movies.In mainstream movies, you have a maximum of two hours to tell your story. That's barely enough time to depict a single main character in a single storyline with both depth and dramatic power. So when you want to tell a multi-line story, something is going to suffer the consequences.The fundamental technique of the novel, and the determining factor in the adaptation, is the dead girl as omniscient narrator. This creates two big story problems. First, if the character is still talking, she isn't really dead. In most cases, this reduces the sense of tragedy, especially at the end when the writers are going for maximum emotional impact. Second, an omniscient narrator who is also a character is an observer. An observer, by definition, is a reactive character and can't drive the story.Faced with multiple story lines and a dead omniscient narrator, what solutions did the writers come up with? They began by increasing the role of Suzy, the narrator, in a vain attempt to make her journey the spine, the driving force, of the script. This necessitated spending large amounts of valuable screen time in her fantastical afterlife world. The various landscapes there are quite beautiful. But the fact remains, Suzy is an observer of the more dramatic, present-tense, living drama going on in the world she left.Whenever you write a scene or a storyline in a script, you must always ask yourself: what is its story value? Answering that question always involves another question: what is the opportunity cost of this scene or storyline? In other words, if I include this in the script what will I be forced to leave out? The scenes in the afterlife have little story value. And they force the writers to cut way back on the effects of Suzy's death on her family. That's a big loss, because this is where the tragedy of the loss of a single life is magnified exponentially.With the little time they have left, the writers focus on the inherent thriller elements to drive the story home. First the father tries to find the killer, followed by his surviving daughter. The thriller scenes have real power, but even here the line is too truncated to pay off as it should.In spite of, or perhaps because of, the imbalance in the story lines, the writers use a technique I call the crosscut funnel that gives the film a powerful ending. In an ever-quickening pace, the story crosscuts between the daughter finding the killer, the mother returning home, the killer burying the body, and Suzy experiencing her first kiss with the boy she left behind. This shows us the upside of the multiple story strands, like four waves crashing on the shore all at once.The most powerful moment of all comes just prior to this crosscutting battle sequence. And here the writers find the true power of the dead narrator technique, along with the one great story value of the beautiful, fantastical world. In a golden meadow surrounding an old leafy tree, Suzy meets all of the girls and women whose lives have been cut short by this one murderer. It is a joyous communion, and it brought tears to my eyes. Tragedy is the profound and painful sense of what might have been. Here in one glorious moment these human beings get to show the audience what it means to be alive, along with the terrible injustice of having their magnificent lives cut short. It's one of the great moments in movies this year, and it reminded me once again why I love writers.To read more reviews go to www.truby.com.",The Lovely Bones

Hollwood seems to forget that good films don't always come from a computer (unless you are Pixar). The CGI was just everywhere. My idea of heaven is the normal white floors. If they just had that and the Gazibo it would have been OK not changing every bloody two seconds.Anyway acting was good and emotional. The girl did look like my vision of Susie in the book and the man was genuinely creepy. The parents do look really heartbroken and the sister is fine actress and looked actually scared when the man was chasing after her.The plot of the original book was a lot different to the film so that was also a disappointment.Overall: Acting:9/10 Plot:5/10 Choice of director:2/10 Final mark:5/10,The Lovely Bones
468,All_things_shining,Another triumph for Peter Jackson,9,15 January 2010,"Peter Jackson's film of Alice Sebold's The Lovely Bones is another showcase for his talent for mixing great storytelling with magical special effects. Its mix of the real and the fantastical is similar to Heavenly Creatures. The mixed reviews and lackluster box office I expect of it only confirms my belief that most people are too shallow and have too little taste to appreciate great art and large ambition when they go to the movies.Why did I love The Lovely Bones? Let me count the ways: STORY: A seemingly dark subject matter (the murder of a teenager) it is actually a story about coping with death, spirituality, a belief in the afterlife, karma, and redemption. ACTING: Saoirse Ronan follows through on the great potential she showed in her Academy Award-nominated performance in Atonement - she absolutely commands the screen in The Lovely Bones and I cannot imagine this film being made without her ethereal beauty and soul. Stanley Tucci is restrained, unrecognizable, and evil incarnate as Mr. Harvey the serial killer. His performance is every bit as mesmerizing as Anthony Hopkins in The Silence Of The Lambs or Javier Bardem in No Country For Old Men. CINEMATOGRAPHY: The photography of Andrew Lesnie is breathtaking and I don't only mean the look of the ""in-between"". The lighting and angles used are gorgeous throughout the film. EDITING: The Lovely Bones is a tour-de-force of editing magic. From the use of match cuts to the glorious cross-cutting between the setting of the plates for dinner at the Salmon home and the murder of Susie in the cornfield dungeon to the unbelievable Hitchcockian suspense when Susie's sister Lindsey searches Mr. Harvey's house for evidence to the pas de deux between Mr. Harvey and the detective (Michael Imperioli) - staring eyes playing peek-a-boo through the doll house - to the scene when Susie enters Mr. Harvey's home and we see her visit the places where each of his victims were left behind, this film is an editing handbook for aspiring filmmakers.More random thoughts: I loved the period detail, not just the obvious hair and clothes and glimpse of The Partridge Family on television and rotary phone but the numbers marked on the bottom of Susie's school books (I forgot how they were like that!) and the magazines in the mall bookstore and in-joke advertisement on the store window for J.R.R. Tolkien's Lord Of The Rings books which were popular at that time... I liked the use of Paul McCartney's ""Another Day"" on what would be the last day of Susie's life but I did not like the new age-ish song used in the scene when Susie is about to join Mr. Harvey's other victims and cross into Heaven, I would have preferred instrumental music there...Neither Mark Wahlberg or Rachel Weisz look like Saoirse Ronan and they are supposed to be her parents - that kind of thing distracts me...some people may feel that Susan Sarandon's perpetually drunk grandmother's entry into the story is a flawed change in tone, but it is a plot necessity considering that the Salmon children's mother moves out and their father later is beaten near to death...the beating of Susie's father may seem a far-fetched plot twist but I think it is clearly meant to be a lesson in not taking an eye for an eye, instead letting God and fate do the punishing...instead of Mr. Harvey predictably being caught as he rolls the safe containing Susie into the junk pit, audience satisfaction may have been lost with the film's ending but I think that even in the 1970s, could someone be arrested using evidence obtained during a break-in? Instead, his comeuppance comes not by being impaled by the hanging icicle or by being pushed over the cliff by the girl in the parking lot (as I believed was about to happen) but by losing his balance after the icicle falls and bouncing violently off the side of the cliff and tree branchesIn conclusion, The Lovely Bones is a film I thought I would respond to and did. I know that many will unfairly compare it to What Dreams May Come and feel it is far inferior to the Lord of the Rings trilogy. However, I feel that it is a haunting cinematic ode to transcendence through the eyes of a teenage girl who only wanted to experience her first kiss before being tragically murdered and further proof that Peter Jackson is one of the most visionary filmmakers working today.",The Lovely Bones

Im going to buy this for sure... One of the best films I have ever seen. We are all going to die and who knows what happens but this movie was exactly the things I believe in spiritually, explains time, different dimensions/plains/heaven/the in between, karma, peace, it brought me to tears. Peter Jackson did a excellent job. I can't believe how well he explained it, stunning cgi that was jaw dropping in some parts. I have not read the book but Im going to buy it tomorrow. I'm sure the book is probably better but they usually are, they cant cram 300 pages into a couple hrs. Go see this movie.",The Lovely Bones
473,Betty-Spaghetti,Skip it! Nothing at all like the book.,2,29 August 2010,"Let me be clear, I'm not a pretentious fop that wants movies to be 'exactly like the book'. I understand that's not possible. You couldn't have squeezed 800 pages of Wicked into a 2 hour play and you can't accurately put this book and its feeling into a movie.That being said, the biggest problem with this movie is lack of substance at all. It's over 2 hours and about half of that are these dreamy, smeary, symbolic scenes. It's like Salvador Dali directed this movie. Wait, let me amend that to if Salvador Dali sucked and directed this movie.Acting wise Stanley Tucci, Mark Wahlberg, are all outstanding. However, Mark's character is the only one we got to see develop. Lindsey's role was drastically reduced and Ruth (who was a VERY main character) is in this for about 2 minutes.I was extremely disappointed. This was a complete waste on what was a phenomenal story, but just had little feeling on the big screen and was over the top on the symbolism and imagery. Okay, Mr. Jackson. WE GET IT. You have lots of vision. As another reviewer said, if you have read the book, don't see the movie. My opinion is just don't see it at all!!",The Lovely Bones
474,manna77,I enjoyed it,8,8 January 2010,"First of all I haven't read the book but I enjoyed the movie very much.It moved me and I thought about it quite a lot after. The cast impressed me the most, with the exception of Rachel Weisz who a normally like.But in her defense I don't think she had much to work with. Mark Wahlberg, Susan Sarandon and Saoirse Ronan did a great job. Stanley Tucci in particular, he is in my opinion one of the most lovable actors but he creeped me out in this one (congrats to the hair and make-up department). I do have to say that the after-life scenes although beautifully shot in my opinion, were a bit stretched in parts. I notice a lot of people on this board talking about plot holes and I have to agree with some of them, but this movie goes under a fantasy for the better part and i don't think it is necessary to insist on things like that with a movie like this. Anyway I'm not a expert.Just wanted to say I enjoyed it. I'll definitely pick up the book. Give this movie a chance.",The Lovely Bones

They are merely individuals who refuse to see any book made into a movie.I have never read the book, but I saw the movie tonight and I think it was the best movie of its type that I have seen in the longest time. The acting and storyline were superb. The only thing that holds this back from a 9 with me is the ending which I won't discuss here. It felt like it had great potential for a cliff-hanging ending and then BAM, the whole thing changes. Didn't like that at all. But maybe it's part of the book.Anyways, just wanted to warn all of you who are being convinced that this movie sucks based on all the negative reviews. Please go see it for yourself before judging it. If you haven't read the book, see it. If you have read it and you aren't a closed minded prick who thinks books turned into movies always deserve one star, still go see it. I really enjoyed this film.",The Lovely Bones

477,bayramsaparov,Average,5,3 January 2010,"I like thrillers and detective movies a lot, and this movie seemed just exactly the type of movie I love. But it is only 50% thriller movie, hence is my mark given for it - 5/10.What I didn't like about movie is that so much of time is spent on absolutely irrelevant parts which take up about an hour or so of the movie. Why make a two hour movie, half of which is just a family/drama? There was a possibility of making a good thriller, show more about the killer, his past crimes. Instead, it is about how mother goes to pick fruits somewhere, how some girl sees her, and boy likes her, and she likes taking pictures and much more which is drama/family type movie parts. I also hated the parts about afterlife. The heaven, the other girls, some places etc. Who has seen afterlife? Who has seen heaven? Nobody! Is it relevant? No! Then why bother showing it?",The Lovely Bones
478,oldmcdonnell,major idealogical faults,1,31 March 2010,"It seems to me that this movie has a problem with society, it is inversely akin to Crime and Punishment. I found this movie to be offensive and sickening in its progression and wish to never see another of its nature for as long as I live. There were some very romantic CG progressions which did present a sense of calm and well-being but they were complemented by a banal human world that is both unrealistic and unfair to the viewer, especially a viewer who has invested considerable emotions in such beautifully portrayed characters. I did not feel any sense of closure after watching this movie and tire of movies that fail to amend such. Of course, there should be movies where the ending is open to interpretation but I do not see how this should be one. The content within makes it very clear who is protagonist and antagonist. Unless you hold the same lofty beliefs as the writer, you are out of luck (granted, I should probably have read the book first). I appreciate the acting, cinematography, and CG. I have not read the original written story, but to me this did not work as a movie, in fact it made me upset and very angry. I would recommend this movie to no one.",The Lovely Bones
479,EloiseD,I liked this movie,7,25 January 2010,"I think it's extremely harsh of some people to say this is one of the worst movies of the year/the start of 2010. Sure, some events took place in the wrong order. Some characters weren't focused on as much as in the book, and maybe some events some people would view as 'key' were missed out - but this is a movie, it's not the book. A book, especially one as complex as The Lovely Bones, would never be able to be depicted on the screen with the same effectiveness as it does in writing. So if you think of it as just a movie, rather than a movie adaptation of a book, then it isn't all that bad.I myself, have read the book. I enjoyed it very much and was still able to enjoy this movie without being too critical.Unlike quite a few comments, I thought that Suzie's 'in between' world was done rather well. It's a hard concept for some people to grasp in the first place, let alone put into a visual picture. To all those who are criticizing it so harshly - could you have come up with anything better or more effective? I know I certainly couldn't have. It's supposed to be a 14 year old girls own world, her way of seeing things, and the fact that you don't like the way that it was done, proves, that it was her own PERSONAL world, not anyone else's... Because you don't see the world the same way as she does do you? It shows that different people view the world in different ways - something that I believe the book focused on greatly and that the movie showed in an effective manner, hence why so many people are complaining that it should have been done differently. ( I sure hope I got that across properly... )One thing however, that I will admit I thought could have been done differently (and only because I have read the book and knew about what was being missed out) was the murder of Suzy. I thought that by leaving out the fact that Suzie's murderer not only killed her, but raped her too, took away some of the raw brutality of the story, as I've noticed some others have been saying. Don't get me wrong, murdering someone is horrible enough, but I just feel that by adding in that one little extra bit of information somehow, it would have added a whole new psychological dimension to the characters (most importantly the serial killer) and what the audience felt towards those characters. In this case, Peter Jackson did tone it down a bit too much and by doing so, took away an element that could have taken the movie to a different emotional level, which is what all directors should be aiming to make a movie achieve. But in saying that, it didn't affect the storyline and I thought the movie was still very sad and anyone with the slightest bit of compassion should have thought so too.When I saw peoples comments about how the movie ""made no sense"", at first I thought that maybe some bits could have been hard to understand if you weren't familiar with the story. But then I realized that people who see it that way obviously like to be spoon fed what to think. The reason why everything isn't explained in extreme detail is so that you, the viewer, can make your own interpretation of what you are seeing and what messages are being shown. It gives you the chance to make your own conclusions, it makes you think, it gives the movie multiple meanings unlike your average cliché storyline does. In this sense the movie was refreshing, just as the book was. It's DIFFERENT - and that's probably why people are being so unnecessarily picky and critical about silly little details that you otherwise wouldn't even think twice about.So my rating for this movie was a 7. Like I stated at the beginning of the review, if you do what I did, and you think of it as a MOVIE, not anything else, you should be able to sit back and enjoy it. If you don't like it, then fair enough. But there is no real reason for anyone to say it is a terrible movie - that may be going a little too far.",The Lovely Bones
480,mdh310,"Forget the book, this film is a disaster on its own terms",4,11 December 2009,"Pretty to look at, beautiful at times even, but with all his distractions Jackson has somehow managed to take brutal and disturbing subject matter and leave me feeling nothing apart from vague amusement and disbelief that he actually went there.I haven't read the book, and even I could tell he completely missed the point. This story, which seems like it should be about the slow disintegration of a family following an unimaginable tragedy, has been turned into a campy whodunnit where you know who dun it from the start.Rather than concentrate on the relationships between the characters, he fails to connect the dots, jumping perspectives often enough to break any of those connections. It comes across as a set of disjointed episodes with overdone cgi in between rather than a coherent story. The jumps are so jarring at times (Oh look, mom is moving out. Oh look, she's come back again) I have to wonder if some of this is down to the editing and there was far more here in earlier cuts.There's one particularly tone-deaf sequence where the grandmother (Susan Sarandon, clearly enjoying herself) swoops in and tries to ""cheer everyone up"". Fair enough there are people who would do that in this sort of situation, but it is so so overdone - overflowing the washer, setting the kitchen ablaze, all to a bouncy rock soundtrack - that I couldn't help thinking of Mrs Doubtfire. Completely off-color for something like this. I was struggling already but kind of gave up at this point, even if I did want to see how far he would go - and the ending is a doozy! After the luminous first half-hour, where I thought there was potential for a serious shattered innocence angle, it's a long sequence of ""wait... really?"" moments.The actors try hard, including Wahlberg who I have trouble taking seriously after ""The Happening"", and I'm pretty sure THEY understood the real story here, but Jackson gives them very little to work with. Actors often say they don't like to watch their own work, because it's almost always disappointing to see a different story than the one you thought you were telling, and they would be well-advised to stay away from this one because Jackson not only changes the story - he barely tells a story at all.",The Lovely Bones
481,horsome,Why butcher a fantastic story?,6,3 January 2010,"The Lovely Bones is somewhat a magazine short story in comparison to the Lord of the Rings. Peter Jackson played a major role in successfully transcending the mammoth story of the travelling Hobbits to the silver screen. You would think that with Jackson's credentials, adapting the Alice Sebold novel would be a cinch. Well he didn't make an absolute meal out of this one but he tried damn hard.I'll focus on the positives first and say that the acting in this film was brilliant, and kudos for the director for bringing out the best in them. Stanley Tucci was creepily fantastic as the villain, and will scare the bejesus out of you. The rest performed well with the cards they were dealt with.The soundtrack was also impressive and contained some high quality tracks.To the negatives, well Mr Jackson has become a victim of CGI fever. Whilst it is not used for the majority of the film, when it is used to create the main character's version of ""heaven"", it comes of as heavily distracting, nonsensical and defy's the simplicity of its concept used in the novel. And very drawn out were these scenes too, such time could have gone to better use like - ADAPTING THE ORIGINAL STORY.Yes, fans of the popular novel will be utterly disappointed or overwhelmed with confusion. The character development is poor and sped through. The reality of the shocking violence which helped you understand the trauma felt by the poor parents has been somewhat sugar coated. If it wasn't for Tucci's great performance of a psychopath I would have thought the the lead character died of natural causes and the suspect just happened to be there and buried her without telling anyone.As previously mentioned the story has been butchered a bit here and there. What really suffers because of this is the beginning of the film. It is somewhat restructured and misses the gripping nature of the story telling in the novel.I should really critique the movie on its on merits and ignore the novel, but I can't, it leaves it open for more criticism as most of the work has been done. There really is no excuse for Jackson to stuff up this film adaptation, the main issues being the script and ridiculous use of special effects. The novel and its author have officially been undermined by Hollywood.",The Lovely Bones

I personally did not read the book and do not intend to. This movie should not been seen by parents of young and teenage children, especially female children. Parents SHOULD not take their kids to see it, either. It is sad and anxiety producing. The movie was also about an hour too long. The run time was 2 hours and 20 minutes, WAY too long for a depressing story to continue. Susan Sarandon is a fabulous actor but her character in this movie didn't fit at all. It tried to provide comic relief, but was so very inappropriate for the story.

The legendary touch that we saw in The Lord of the Rings series was sadly not present, as this in-depth tale was mishandled, juggled and dropped in a very unflattering manner - not what we expect from Mr Jackson and his team. The Lovely Bones is potentially a life changing story, but it is squeezed out poorly.The story in itself is quite profound and disturbingly moving (the excellent writing ability of Alice Sebold), however the power is tragically lost amid the array of overly expanded scenes of Susie in the 'In-between'. The beautiful cinematography is stunning and creates an atmosphere, but the way in which it's fused together produces a disappointing patchwork. There are certainly some talents on display with Tucci truly creating a menacing presence, and Weisz's broken mother being entirely convincing. However, these roles are disparagingly lost in the cascade of drawn out and over-emphasised scenes of a CGI afterlife. Unfortunately, these bones are not so lovely.",The Lovely Bones

I understand somethings has to be shortened down to fit a movie, but to change things just to change things. Why? The book was beautiful, and so much that made the book beautiful, was left out of the movie.In the book, the father has a clear idea of who killed her. He pesters the police over and over again to go after this person. In the movie, he has no clear idea of who killed her. He throws random accusations, ""this person may have killed her, since he wears adult diapers!"", making him seem like a total idiot. Why? Why could they not follow the book in this? It would not make the movie any longer, not make anything unexplained. It was just changed to be changed. And such was done all trough the movie.The beautiful one year anniversary to her murder, the gathering in the corn field, left out. This was one of the heights of the book, it should have been in the movie.So much was left out. So much was changed. The movie gave none of the feelings you got from the book.

So I will just say, The Lovely Bones had stunning visual effects. It was a very beautiful movie. I have not read the book, but the movie was not very suspenseful at all except for the part when Lindsey (pardon if I got her name wrong) snuck into Mr. Harvey's house. Most of it was crying, sadness, and dialogue. During some droughts, I was thinking ""I wish this movie was shorter...."". But I felt the end was way too rushed. It was very random, how Mr. Harvey fell off a cliff, then after that, everybody was happy and then credits. It seemed like there was no actual conclusion. Now once again, I have not read the book, so I don't know what happens. I thought the acting was superb, especially the grandmother. I would just say everything was great about it except for being too slow in the beginning, then ended up being too rushed at the end. So my official rating is an average of 6/10.

488,redmaim,Nobody sets out to make a bad movie.,5,14 May 2010,"I really like Peter Jackson, and he is obviously a very talented film maker, but I'm afraid to say The Lovely Bones is not very good. I haven't read the book so I can't really comment about how the two compare but despite a spirited performance from Saoirse Ronan the film is overall a bit of a mess. Every now and then it touches on brilliance; the interplay between Suzie and her Grandmother (Susan Sarandon), or the moment when Suzie's sister decides to take matters into her own hands, in these scenes you can see Peter Jackson having fun with the material and leaning back on his comedy/horror roots, these are moments which you can tell he doesn't really need to think about, he's picked them out whilst reading the book and fleshes them out convincingly. Unfortunately despite these glimpses of brilliance, overall The Lovely Bones is a confused, tonally awkward and embarrassingly sentimental CGI mess. Jackson's films aren't difficult to sell, simply by slapping ""from the director of Lord of the Rings"" on any posters for his films guarantees them an audience, which means studio executives are probably less concerned about the overall quality of his films than a less tried-and-tested director. The truth is, Jackson is badly in need of an honest script editor. We saw the seeds of it in Lord of the Rings, then in King Kong he vastly overcomplicated a fairly simple story, setting up the back story for far too many characters in the first half before killing most of them off in the second. These are mistakes which for most directors would be corrected within a few script edits, but people don't want to say no to Jackson, and this is why his films fall short. It makes me sad because he is a very talented director, he just needs to reign his big ideas in a little.",The Lovely Bones

Within the first 15 minutes of the movie, we all three looked at each other and said out loud, ""Ok. This is pretty good so far. When does it get bad?"" 45 minutes into the movie, we were all three on the edge of our seats, and again we all looked at each other and asked, ""OK. seriously. When does this movie get BAD?"" Finally, when the credits rolled, we looked at each other and said, ""When the f*** did that movie get BAD?"" The Lovely Bones is a great film.

The special effects might not be up to par in some parts, but who cares??!! The story is there. The editing of this film is set at a relentless pace, giving each character just the right amount time for you to care about them. All of those people who read the book who say ""It's not as good as the book. It focuses too much on BLAH BLAH..."" You know what? F*** yourselves. I'm sure you would say that about any movie adaptation. So, do yourselves a favor and just read the book, skip the movie. How can you expect ANY film adaptation to be completely faithful? Your perspective of the story is going to be EXTREMELY different P. Jackson's, or, anyone else's for that matter. Thats the great thing about books. YOU create the images. When the movie is on, you watch someone elses interpretation of it. I'm sure if they had made the movie exactly as it was written,(the movie YOU would have made.) it would have been a complete bore fest. Am I right? Same with LOTR's. If PJ had adapted those stories to match frame for frame the book, it would have been incredibly boring. And thats coming from a once every few years reader of the stories.

490,MilkaKuh,Not like most other films!,9,1 May 2011,"-The following will not reveal any spoilers above those presented in any trailer-It is rather sad, to see how people are grabbing on to many of the former reviews and are continually bashing on the CGI use in this, in my opinion, hauntingly beautiful movie. If one would actually watch this movie without reading any reviews at all, without having an opinion about a movie they are about to watch before even having seen it for themselves and just take it for what is presented, I strongly believe there would be much more positive opinions about it. And to mention this before anything else is said: I do not believe that the movie is too CGI crowded since the scenes at hand are meant to be unearthly and even a little mystical at that! I am not a very emotional person, I haven't even been able to really feel sad when others around me were already sobbing. But going into this movie and just letting it do its magic, it actually touched me deeply and made me think about it! Sure - there are a few things that might have been done differently, probably even quite a bit better. But the all-in-all feel this movie leaves the viewer with is incredible. The bizarre but at the same time beautiful world of the in-between, the pain of the family members over the horrible loss and their unique ways of, not necessarily dealing, but rather living with it, even the sick mind behind the murder - it all works together in creating that viewing experience that is deeply touching through its countless layers.The acting of pretty much each individual actor is already quite impressive, but as the characters interact, one can actually feel the emotional bonds and understandings, as well as the tension or even hatred between them. All in all I can only urge anyone who loves movies that go beyond that typical mirror of merely entertaining and uninspired filmmaking to watch this gem. Certainly not everyone will enjoy or appreciate it as much as I did, but at least give it the chance it deserves without going into it, already looking for those 'evil CGI' parts and at the very least you will have your own opinion about it afterward and not the one of some guys that merely told you the same thing they only heard from someone else ;)I hope you have a great viewing experience!",The Lovely Bones
491,joaovieira100,Slow down Peter!,5,10 September 2012,"I've watched this movie multiple times, trying to guess what was wrong with Peter Jackson. He had a really ""workable"" story to work with,a beautiful soundtrack and also unique actors.This is one of those movies that once you are done watching it, you stop for awhile trying to think what the heck was wrong with its director. One of the big flaws of the movie: too much sugar in a glass of water. Susie Salmon is completely naive and lives in a beautiful and pink world in her head. OK,fine, she is just a teenager, but then, her colorful world starts to take over the movie and muffle its main plot: the search for her killer. Peter Jackson tries to divide it up into two completely different worlds that will interact among themselves in one way or another. Thus, the ""mysticism"" of her world will interfere in her father's search, and then what was supposed to be a realistic and also ""magical"" movie, turns out being a flawed drama. Suppose ""heaven"" actually exists. Nobody from there will help you to find their murderer. It is just too random a guy start to suspect about his neighbor/friend or who else he wants to, because he felt like hating that person. Come on! Let's grow up and face the reality: things like this don't happen at all. OK, but what about the place where Susies lives in? It might not be real too? - I know this, and according t another reviews, The Lovely Bones was supposed to be a story that would follow the kardecist spiritism beliefs. As a student of this religion, I can tell, yes there are nice moments depicting this doctrine. However the world wherein the ""dead people"" live, doesn't get in touch with the world that we live in like that movie shows on screen. I mean, it is not the way things usually happen according to the doctrine. Just one brief point, the only really beautiful part of the movie encounters in one of the final scenes. I am not going to tell it here, I will let you figure this out by yourself. The rest of the movie? Just a big flawed attempt to make a beautiful and thrilling movie.

493,micknanoo,Suzie's sublimely realised nothingness is perfect but it's the half-baked proceedings down on earth that don't ring true.,5,21 February 2010,"After dealing with giant gorillas, oliphants, dwarfs, orcs, T-Rexes and Adrien Brody's enormo-nose, Peter Jackson finds himself now tackling a 14-year-old girl. A dead one, to be precise. After all the blockbusting of The Lord Of The Rings and his gaseous remake of King Kong - already dating horribly, by the way - can he take it down from eleven and deliver an intimate and wistful character-piece to sit alongside Heavenly Creatures? Not so much.1973. Suzie Salmon (Saoirse Ronan) is 14 years old and on the cusp of young adulthood when she is snatched from the earth by a vile neighbour by the name of George Harvey (Stanley Tucci). Save for a blood-soaked hat, neither body nor killer are ever found, much to the torment of her parents Jack and Abigail (Mark Wahlberg & Rachel Weisz). Suzie, however, isn't ready for St. Peter's Gates just yet. From the surroundings of a limbo created by her own soul, she watches her loved ones as they work through their trauma and sees the legacy of pain that her murderer has caused, both past and present. There are great things in The Lovely Bones, adapted from Alice Sebold's popular bestseller - and Jodie Marsh's favourite book, natch. Ronan and Tucci are two of them. In fact, when our forces of light and dark are not on screen, things slink down to bell-bottomed 70's soap opera territory very quickly. With empathy blazing through her sea-blue eyes, the young Carlow-born actress holds the film together as both real and afterlife run parallel, bleeding occasionally into each other. Frozen forever with her arrested innocence, on the cusp of adolescent cynicism, she is wonderful. As the devil-they-know, Tucci's jaundiced, wispy-haired killer is electric. With cuddly then gradually menacing tones in his speech, as he lures Suzie to her death, you want him to keep talking because you know the silence will be too loud to bear.While on the visual side of things, as you can imagine, it's rather special. Whether it's giant ships in bottles shattering against rocks, mirrored lakes with magnificent vanilla skies, or tree leaves fluttering away to become birds, Jackson let his WETA boys and girls feed their dreams here. Though they certainly fall into 'special-effects' creative, as opposed to Michel Gondry 'step out of your frickin' mind' creative, they're perfectly suited to the imagination of a child taken so suddenly from her sun-flared youth. Or they could be a Coldplay video. You choose.A brace of strong performances and pretty pictures aside, there's plenty that doesn't work. Polo-shirted Walhberg - brought in 3 days before shooting to replace Ryan Gosling - acts like a man who was brought in 3 days before shooting to replace Ryan Gosling. Sure, he's more Boogie Nights good than The Happening bad, but he's out of his element, obtaining devastated-dad mode by simply looking a bit sick. Aw. Weisz is virtually invisible from any plot that is going on, so much so that when lifted right out of the story, it doesn't miss a beat. But that may be virtue of the fact that there aren't many beats in there anyway. Momentum is lost when we step away from either of the worlds for too long a time. There are scenes with the usual amplified emotional intensity we've come to expect from Jackson, but we don't have much of a plot to justify them. Even lust-for-life Grandmother Susan Sarandon - who filled her late granddaughter with enough romance and never-grow-old zeal to sustain her heart in limbo - seems a little disinterested in what's going on, and only gets a seriously weak music montage for her efforts. All very watchable, of course, and lovers of the book may delight, but after being asked to invest in the father's 'whodunnit?' and Suzie's 'what now?', the climax curiously sells it short. Test audiences seemed to agree, resulting in a cheap augmented pay-off.",The Lovely Bones
494,wmrdbull,"It wasn't bad, but it sure wasn't perfect. (Spoiler Alert)",7,11 January 2017,"Was Mr. Peter Jackson's The Lovely Bones a good movie? I just discovered this movie very recently from a old friend. I decided to watch myself but I was skeptical at first due to all of the mixed reviews the movie received. It was okay. The film does have its bad moments; I hated Lenerman, some of the scenes with Grandma Lynn were stupid, CGI was a bit corny and it could have handled the subject matter more maturely. Despite of the bad moments, the film did have its good moments. I personally liked the scene were Susie and her father made contact in the in-between and I also liked the scene were Susie joins Harvey's other victims in Heaven. Susie's death (from the part were she enters Harvey's dungeon to the part were she finds out that she died) was handled well and the kiss scene was good in my opinion. Overall, this movie was not perfect. It had its bad moments but it also had its good moments. Sairose Ronan was wonderful as the lead character and I want to read the book.",The Lovely Bones
495,scouter-1,What Dreams May Come II?,2,8 June 2010,"This movie is hopelessly derivative, desperately artsy and left me completely unfulfilled. The bulk of the film is basically a rehashing of material better presented in What Dreams May Come with a One Hour Photo twist. I do not believe that the rape scene at the beginning should have been as graphic as it was in the novel (which was also not good) but should have been made more clear. I was at no point emotionally engaged in this film. The ending goes from sappy pubescent romanticism to clumsily complete. I simply cannot believe Peter Jackson would soil his name with this hackneyed story. Spielberg's participation is, unfortunately, in keeping with his recent streak of disposable movies. By the way: Is Saying it is ""clumsily complete"" a spoiler?",The Lovely Bones
496,elizabeth-145,"Excellent film, easily in my Top 10!!",9,19 April 2010,What can I say Peter Jackson has done it again. This film is so good in so many ways. It had me close to tears all the way through. The acting of each character is superb especially Saorise Ronan as Susie Salmon. I had read the book prior and am quite happy with the way the film turned out. It could have been much more darker and depressing but instead it is filmed on a much more lighter note and therefore is ultimately much better than it could have beenThe CGI is noticeable in the 'In-Between' scenes but is tastefully done and doesn't take away anything from the overall reaction to the movieThere is actually no 'heaven' scenes in this as some people have mistakenly thought. We never see Susie go to heaven she is only ever in the In BetweenI highly recommend everyone to go and watch this movie,The Lovely Bones
497,adrowse,Frustrating,2,6 April 2019,This film reminds me of that feeling of when you have an itch you can't quite get it. Like the ones you get in your ear you can kind of scratch towards it but ultimately you are left being very unsatisfied.,The Lovely Bones
498,obsessionwithmusic,How could you Peter?,2,17 January 2010,"This movie is so poorly done I can't even believe it was allowed to come to theaters to be honest. I read the book and absolutely loved it but while watching I couldn't help but wonder if Peter Jackson had even picked it up. Hardly any of the actors fit the characters roles and most of them didn't even try, it was like watching a huge disaster on the big screen. Peter cut out everything important to make it a PG-13 movie when it clearly must be R to really get its point across and be done correctly. He removed the affair between the mother and the detective, the son wasn't even in it from the middle to the end, and nothing was explained at all. You had to have read the book to even get what he was hinting at and even then you were confused. Jackson just tried to pretty it up with special effects and while they were well done they didn't have any point and in the end looked rather ridiculous. All in all it was a movie with huge names and a decent budget that was just a piece of garbage that should have been put in the right hands. I hope in a few years someone with a real artistic eye and the ability to take such a great book with amazing potential comes long and takes hold of this gem and makes something worth watching out of it. Stick to action movies Peter, for the love of God!",The Lovely Bones
499,joellyn917,"A lovely gem of a book, a sorry portrayal on film",2,1 May 2010,"Alice Sebold's book was one of those precious gems, a piece of literary fiction that touches, saddens, shocks, but ultimately uplifts you and makes you hope that in the midst of unspeakable grief and loss there is hope and possibly a existence beyond mortal life. There was so much, and humanity and compassion in her book, which had a great impact on me when I read it. It made me want my heaven to be something like Susie Salmon's. I avoided watching this movie at first because I thought you really couldn't improve on the book, and I was right. I also thought if anyone could do it, Peter Jackson could, but in that respect I was very wrong. It's too bad, because the performances by Saoirse Ronan, Mark Wahlberg and Stanly Tucci excel, and are the only reason for anyone to watch this film. Mr. Jackson completely botched the family dynamic, and took the heart out of the original story. Susan Sarandon's grandmother (who would believe that?) was a caricature, and Rachel Weisz was wasted as Susie's mom. And Heaven, which in the book was delightful, was reduced to nothing more than cartoon CGI, so unnecessary and disappointing. This is one movie that should not have been made.",The Lovely Bones
500,josh-bassett,"Book worth a look, give the flick ""the flick""",3,2 January 2010,"I saw TLB at the Palace in Westgarth (Melbourne) last night. My girlfriend knew I didn't like the film as soon as the credits rolled because I apparently made an audible groan of displeasure. I couldn't help it, for me the ending was the icing on a very crappy cake.In short, the use of CGI was abused at the cost of developing the real characters/story (typical in Hollywood), the characters lacked depth and the screenplay was trite and lacked subtlety.I won't repeat what others have already pointed out, but here's a few of the major issues which I couldn't get over:* Jackson didn't build any depth in the relationship between Susie Salmon and Ray Singh (aside from Susie's infatuation). But he expected us to believe that they had some kind of enduring love which transcended life and death.* How did the Gothic girl know to find Ray at the gazebo in the mall? Ray told Susie to meet him there (it was unlikely that he also wrote it in the note).* I don't believe it would have been possible for Stanley Tucci to dig the bunker (in which he murdered Susie) without having been seen by anybody. We're shown a shot of Tucci digging out the first couple of shovel loads of soil in the middle of the harvested corn field. But the bunker he digs is fairly large and certainly well over his head height as he is able to stand up in there with headroom. So where did all the excavated soil go? Did he wheel it away a wheelbarrow? A truck? How did he manage to dig a hole that deep with just a shovel? You would need bucket and winch to get the soil out of the hole. In any case, this would have taken a considerable amount of time and someone would have witnessed him. Finally, he had to have brought all the soil back to fill in the hole after he killed her!* When Lindsey Salmon is in Tucci's bedroom flipping through his secret diary, she hears him come back into the house. At that point she'd seen enough to seriously suspect that he was guilty of murdering her sister. Why then does she sit there and keep looking though the pages while he creeps around the house listening? Why did she not grab the book and head straight for the window?* When Lindsey is climbing out the window after he hears her drop the floor board and runs up the stairs, why does she not start screaming for help? Obviously it is a family-friendly neighbourhood. Surely there would be someone around to hear her and come to her aid.* After Lindsey runs back to her parents house, why doesn't she run in the door screaming? Help! Dad, (oh hi) mum, grandma...our neighbour murdered Susie! Quick call the police! But no, she stands there quietly (her heart no doubt pounding in her chest) while her dear old dad hobbles down the stairs for a tender moment now that her mum decided to come home from her fruit picking retreat. Seriously WTF? Why did she wait so long to tell someone?* Why did Tucci keep Susie's body in the safe in his basement for a year? Isn't he meant to be a cold calculating serial killer? That doesn't seem very smart to me, considering that he got rid of all the other girls' bodies. Furthermore, unless that safe was air and water-tight (which I doubt because it was so old looking) his basement/house would be smelling like 1-year-old rotting corpse and all kinds of rancid liquid would be oozing out onto his basement floor. Lindsey would have smelled it when she broke in to the basement. The guy at the garbage dump helping him heave the safe into the sinkhole surely would have been able to smell the rotting body inside.* Why did Jackson (or was it Spielberg) have to make the afterlife a Christian ""heaven""? And do all the angels in heaven wear little crucifix earrings? If Jackson had been less specific (and more subtle) here then the audience could have read into it with their own beliefs.My point is that this is not a 7-star movie and that just because Peter Jackson directed it doesn't mean a thing. See it at your own risk.",The Lovely Bones
501,lrallendc,Surprisingly Schlocky Film Making,4,27 January 2010,"With a stellar award-winning cast and director, I was prepared for an excellent movie. Others who go expecting this will be sadly disappointed. I did not read Alice Sebold's book. And if Sebold hopes that the movie will direct film goers to her book, I am sure she is sadly disappointed as well. She should sue someone for making this schlock! I do not even know where to start. Okay, with the actors. They tried valiantly to do the film justice. The problem is there is no decent script to work with. And Jackson seemed to work against the actors. Susan Sarandon, as usual, does an excellent turn as the mother-in-law. She brought life to an otherwise lifeless movie. The only problem is, her portrayal belonged in another movie entirely! Rachel Weisz was the only smart actor in the movie. She left it completely!!, well for awhile anyway. Even the poor dead had to stay around until the end of the film! As for direction, what was Peter Jackson thinking? My bet is that he phoned in his directorial duties. What could have been a taut, psychological thriller had all the gravitas of a titmouse! The plot: a slow, plodding muddle of disjointed scenes without any sensible narrative or sequencing. A freshmen at Columbia film school even knows this elemental foundation of film making. Tucci's scenes are tolerable, but not to the extreme that has been recognized by film award nominations. I liked him better in Julie & Julia. However, the two scenes that resonated the most were his, and were lived up to what I expected this movie would hold throughout; the excellent scene with Ronan in the cornfield and the one with her sister in Tucci's house. Two scenes do not make a movie however.Unfortunately, The Lovely Bones is a dog. And it is a bone even a dog wouldn't want; lovely or not.",The Lovely Bones

503,clapperclawer,The Lovely Bones Review,5,10 May 2019,"The Lovely Bones was a decent film. The Lovely Bones, directed by Peter Jackson and made in 2009, was a film where a young girl, Susie Salmon, is the main character in a happy semi-romantic movie which soon starts to approach the darker theme. Susie lives in a family with a mom, a dad, a sister and a younger brother.
Saoirse Ronan, who plays Susie, does a good job in this film. Her acting feels realistic, except for the parts where she seems very unrealistically dense during suspenseful scenes. She does well as the young Susie Salmon character and she does her fair share of work in her parts.
The neighbor across the street, named George Harvey, quickly becomes the main villain of the film after Susie manages to snap a photo of him in which you do not see his face. Harvey has a lot of moments in the movie where you cannot see his face which is a very clever way of introducing who the main villain is going to be. However, the movie feels like it introduces the main villain a little too soon.
Especially almost right after Susie says a bit of dialogue where she said that she was murdered. It almost instantly allows the viewer to figure out who the main villain is going to be before he even makes any moves. At one point, the family adds a grandmother, but a little later into the film. The film ends up taking a little bit of a darker turn when Susie is seen chasing a note outside, but ends up running into George Harvey.
Harvey gives a lot of dialogue in this long scene, with Susie giving simple or one worded answers. This part bothered me the most with Harvey giving off the most obvious and creepy dialogue with Susie still deciding to follow him to where he wants to take her. Harvey then shows Susie a trapdoor in which a semi-secret underground hideout is revealed that looks as scary as an underground hideout could look. Regardless of all the red flags, Susie still goes underground with him where he looks around one last time before closing the hatch. The idea and staging for this scene in a dead field is a brilliant idea, but it feels ruined with the character dialogue and how dense the main character is.
She only starts to realize the red flags when Harvey gets extremely ""awkward"" with his dialogue which then starts to get aggressive, but only after she's stuck underground. At this point, Susie sees an opening in which she attempts to run, but she gets grabbed by Harvey where she responds by kicking him in the face... or so you thought. There's a part in which this film gets very confusing which is right after the part where Susie kicks the killer off her legs and makes a run for it.
This part seems like it's actually happening, especially with the reaction that a girl gives on the street as Susie runs past her. However, the event entirely is a hallucination that seems all so real, which you start realizing once she starts seeing visions and seeing things that are happening in real time but she's not actually there. This part really gets confusing and it feels really off and the set up makes almost no sense at all and it really felt like one of the more worse scenes in the film. After the hallucination, Susie is basically found dead after the police find a lot of blood around the trapdoor after the underground area was destroyed.
The family is really broken up about Susie's loss and the dad takes the largest hit especially since he was making bottle boats with Susie a few days before the events leading up to her death. He starts destroying his entire collection of boats after grieving for a while, all except the boat he showed Susie how to make. The movie starts to feel like a dream past this point for the longest time and it turns the movie into a really weird and awkward film that becomes hard to understand and honestly creates a lot of the ""what is happening?"" feeling.
The film doesn't exactly get better from this point on, besides the grandma that adds a bit of comedy to the film which works in its own way. His next target of course was Susie's sister and he started a plan to carry out his plan until the dad ended up stepping in and piercing parts of the puzzle together. Long story short, the sister finds the incriminating evidence after a really bad break in scene which ended up making me laugh more than it did making me feel suspense.
After this, the sister turns it in forcing the killer to dump all the evidence in which during this scene it gets really confusing throughout it. Susie takes the place of a girl and the guy she liked ends up kissing Susie, or the girl that she took place of. Hard to tell what to call her. The killer has to and does skip town. He ends up getting away after skipping town making you think that he's performed the perfect crime until he ends up finding another victim outside of a diner who he constantly asks to give a ride to. She keeps telling him to go away or go bother someone else rather than bother her, but he keeps insisting that she gets a ride from him and that he'd take her anywhere she wanted to go.
She again, tells him to go away, but this time as he's being very insistent with his request, he gets hit with an icicle from some otherworldly force that causes it to fall from a branch where he then loses his balance and falls off of a cliff and then dies. Personally, I didn't like this idea on his ending. It was deserved, but not the best way he could've gone out. They ended off the main villain with an unknown death because no one ever realizes that he died. He wasn't even caught which would've felt more preferred.
A man who killed tons of victims and also planned to add one more to his body count only gets taken out by an icicle that got in his shirt which bothered him and he fell and died. After his death, the movie touches the life of those who were impacted by Susie's death and shows how they're living after the events of the killer's death and also how they all feel after having time to cope with Susie's death. The ending was good, but not great. Overall, the movie feels decent to me. The ideas were smart, but ruined occasionally by timing, dense characters, or just overall how it was played out. The movie gets at most a decent rating.",The Lovely Bones

506,ErickAdam,Simply Brilliant,10,7 January 2010,"""The Lovely Bones"" is one of, if not the singular best film I've seen in the past year. This is certainly Peter Jackson's best directorial work - showcasing creativity and originality in his shots that was missing from some of his more generic work, while still being palatable enough for the average theater goer to avoid feeling ""art house."" The picture beautifully juxtaposes and interweaves the sharply contrasting visuals of 1970s mid-west suburbia with the brilliance and dream-like qualities of ""the in-between"" world. It's a feast for the eyes, and visually enjoyable in the same way that one might spend hours lost in the intricacy of a masterful painting.In terms of plot and story flow, ""The Lovely Bones"" demands some participation from the audience. The flow is slightly non-linear and tends to follow several different characters at the same time. Judging from the reviews on this page, this bothered some viewers. I found it a refreshing changing of pace from the all too predictable Hollywood standard.Also to be praised is Jackson's ability create moments of nearly unbearable suspense and tension. In the theater I was in, he made the audience literally scream with the simple action of a loose floorboard creaking. You'll find yourself gripping the seat in anticipation of what's going to happen next.Every element of this film was perfectly executed. If I had my say, we'd see it in the running for Best Picture this year.",The Lovely Bones

The special effects were not necessary - they ruined a lot of the story because they just didn't make sense. The timeline was out of sequence. If you had not read the book, you wouldn't understand what the movie was supposed to be about. The safe going into the big hole in the ground at the end, and the murderer having to bribe the guy to take it? That was their business. Why was ""filling in the hole"" even a part of this?

DO NOT SCROLL DOWN IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN THE FILM OR READ THE BOOK.What was once a structure of ""Lovely Bones"" is now a jumble. When I first heard that this was being made into a movie I was both excited and terrified all at the same time. Novels so beautifully created and written, are often sadly lost in their transition to film. Alice Sebold's story is one that is so perfectly layered, with so many different characters and dimensions, that it made the challenge even greater for Peter Jackson. While trying to make the ""Lovely Bones"" accessible to a wider audience by eliminating the true depths of the novel, they eliminated the foundation, and without a strong foundation all things will collapse. Sadly the director built this movie on a sink hole, and like George Harvey's safe containing Susie's remains, it can do nothing but continue to fall deeper and deeper.",The Lovely Bones
511,seal_aao,Once again Jackson fails miserably..,4,4 January 2010,"The book is great and what makes it so great are the characters, their complexity and how thoroughly they are introduced. Whereas the book excels in creating characters with real emotions, the movie leaves them empty - like shells that have no real meaning to the movie.I expected this movie to be rather good, and at times it is, but I was once again disappointed by PJ - who seems to only have skill for cinematography but none for the story, the characters and the things that really make a good film. This movie lacks everything that made the book so good, emotion. Editing is poor and what bothers me is that this could have easily been a great movie but the characters were left out, they were in a supporting role while the CGI did the lead roles.The actors did their best with what they had and it's a real shame that they were given so little to work with. It's a shame that a director who understands nothing of the story, and its importance, was chosen to do this film.

512,Cathalised,Death is no fairy tale.,6,15 March 2010,"Let me start right off stating that I was (and actually still am) a real fan of the book. To some extend, I can relate myself to what happens in the story, so I got sucked into the story without a moment's pause. There's a lot of intricate characters present in the book's story, be it Susie's mother, her father, her brother...as it is in grieving, pretty much everyone involved has a lot to digest and undergoes a complicate transformation.And that's where this movie adaptation lacks. Severely.I concur that possibly, Jackson was in his right to make this a movie which could be liked by girls of Susie's age, which allows for a looser, almost Disney-like approach to the novel. And he's probably succeeded in creating such a thing. The point is however that there was so much more potential within the story that I cannot help but feel disappointed as to what the movie's writers have eventually come up with.For all of its pretty imagery, the script lacks specifically what the novel had plenty of. It lacks what grieving adds to a person's life. Depth. Complexity. Development. There's no real depth given to the family's grieving in the movie, be it Abigail's affair with the police detective, Buckley's building of a fortress or Lindsey's talk with the principal at her school. None of those vital elements from the novel appear on screen - it almost seems as if all of the novel's darkness was butchered in favour of a colourful fairy tale. Now, of course a movie can never follow a novel to the tee and it would be unfair to criticize it for failing to do so, but I find that far too much valuable time is spent on afterlife eye-candy - time which should've been used showing what an impact the loss of a loved one can have on a family. That's what the book is about, so the movie should at least try to accomplish the same feat.However, the sparse moments of character development have that little time to work with that they almost feel rushed, and come across as an afterthought. And that doesn't do the story justice, at all. It would've been a lot better if the script were to follow one of the family members instead; in the novel, Susie's the narrator...but for this movie adaptation, Jackson would've made a better (a lot more daring, but better) decision by re-telling the same story from a point of view where we can actually feel the change of a person first-hand. Feel as they feel. Feel it as it really is. There's so much room and potential for excellent drama here. Now, all the valuable time is gobbled up by one big acid trip-fairy tale, with a couple of story chunks thrown in to give us something to chew on every once in a while. Story chunks that seem to revolve more around Mr Harvey than the fabric of the restless family he's torn a hole into.Now, apart from my criticism about the script, I like to say that Tucci's performance of Harvey was spot-on. When I saw he was cast for the role of the bad guy, I immediately knew he was the right man for the job. And he was. He made me cringe on multiple occasions with his downright horrifying creepiness. Kudos go out to him, and also the rest of the cast. Sarandon, Wahlberg, Weisz, bravo to them all. Same goes for the youngsters aboard - Ronan, McIver...kudos to them. It's a shame though that all of their performances were let down by the script. I can recommend the book to everyone who hasn't read it, including, so it seems, the writers behind this movie.",The Lovely Bones

514,locatekyle,My retort to all the bad reviews,8,2 January 2010,"After reading all the bad review's and not reading the book I went to see this film with not much expectation other than it would most likely be a visual feast and I was not let down. Wow it was glorious, stunning, beautiful etc. I didn't notice everything else that most of the people's bad reviews thought about it yes maybe a little sappy but it is a story about a young girl who gets killed before her time, before she has even had her first kiss, a fathers love for that child.. yada yada THAT IS VERY SAD. I thought that the CGI sequences flowed nicely from reality and back I wonder if some people have a chip on there shoulder about Peter Jackson because of his success from little old New Zealand when they just can't get a break even after years of film school yall must be very annoyed. I guess that had I gone in expecting one of the greatest films of all time I would have been disappointed but I was not at all unhappy with the film it is an enjoyable piece of art if anything maybe to many big name actors that I could not get past there previous roles (Stanley Tucci) possibly studio execs putting there clammy hands in the mix to maximize the box office, shame on you studio shame on you.",The Lovely Bones
515,skmcc8584,Best movie Iv'e seen in a while,9,29 January 2010,"First of all I am a very tough critic of movies to the point of being obnoxious. My family and friends refuse to go to the movies with me for fear of embarrassment and I have been asked to leave (never reluctantly) a few movie theaters. That said, I give this movie a solid A. I started watching the movie with great pessimism (as I usually do) after all this is being directed by the guy that did Lord of the Rings and is starring Mark Wahlberg. As the beginning glided through the background at a good (not to fast) pace I was impressed at the even and seamless setup. The acting in the beginning was superb as the normal family was being laid out in front with just a touch of idiosyncrasy to make it real. The horrible dialog made the characters real. Next, I cannot remember ever seeing a movie with a gruesome murder handled as tastefully and respectfully as Mr. Jackson did in this one after all this is someone's little girl, this is your little girl. BRAVO! (shades of Hitchcock here) As the movie continues through limbo and reality we are faced with profound life questions and slowly (intentional) a thriller emerges. I could go on and on about specifics of the movie as I witnessed a number of acting and directorial gems. As the movie makes its point on so many levels it ends not unsatisfying, but not satisfying either, kind of like real life. If you haven't seen the movie I promise you two things. 1. It will break your heart. 2. You will remember it. To describe this movie in one word it would be ""haunting"" This movie should be nominated for best picture and Saoirse Ronan and Stanly Tucci should receive nominations as well.One need only go to walmart and look at the missing children on the wall to have this movie hit home.",The Lovely Bones
516,bessieclark,Death by 1000 cuts,4,28 December 2009,"This film, like King Kong before it, suffers from a bad edit -having been cut down from a roughly 5+ hour assembly to the 135 min final running time. And as with King Kong, Jackson and his editor have cut the wrong bits out, favoring big action over character development and creating a CGI world over building a real world with real people.There is basically no back story for any of the characters, and if they have relationships with each other we never see it. Other comments suggest these character driven scenes were shot and deleted.It felt like there was a better film in there, but the director was trying to cover all bases and got seriously distracted by creating landscapes (that move! that change!)round his characters instead of attending to the characters themselves.As a viewer (who had read the book- though not a big fan of it) I had no sense of who either parent was apart from the sketchiest of details. The film starts out okay, but with Susie's disappearance (and the introduction of her 'in between' existence), the film starts to go seriously wrong.Remember the sequence in Kong with the dinosaurs that went on and on and on... well there's a lot of running round in the after life, running and laughing, laughing and running...Character development has never been Jackson's strong point (the obvious exception being 'Heavenly Creatures') and his editor here has done nothing to help us feel connected with the characters.The performances are okay but it would be interesting to have seen this film where equal time was given to developing a real world to go with that hideously banal heaven. They are more like pieces being moved round a chessboard than real people with real emotions.My only hope is that Jackson changes editors for the next film, or uses the LOTR method of employing more than one editor- the mish mash evident here, and on his previous film seriously undermine his skills as a film maker.",The Lovely Bones

Examples...a rose magically blooms in his hand and so that must mean the person standing in front of him killed his daughter, and as a result this father almost breaks down the man's door and chases him into a corn field with a baseball bat. So much for due process... I think the movie was trying to project a heavy religious undertone and faith was supposed to be convincing enough for the movie to be plausible, but anyone with an IQ higher than a loaf of bread needs a little more substance and reasoning for a movie to seem clever and captivating.

518,info-lacinerata,A film who swings between reality and fantasy.,7,6 January 2010,"Good photography and the scenery created thanks to the power of technology seem to be the base of a film that could have been a geniality but it drowns between the drama and suspense. It conveys the necessary feelings but it certainly don't get us involved, just the parts where the resolution of the case take presence are the strong interesting points of the story. Jackson never decides from where to tell the story, so that the mixture of 'earth' and 'heaven' sounds strange and distract from the main issue. Nevertheless the movie entertains enough to those who are following the main story and not those who looks for a drama involving a family loosing one of their members. Good but not great Tucci performance",The Lovely Bones
519,isen_river,Though flawed with bad plot choices creating abrupt changes in tone it shows hints of brilliance,5,25 January 2010,"I'm a big fan of both the book and Peter Jackson, though i think he had more misses than hits in this adaptation. The major problems with the film originated with the script, writers Jackson, Fran Welsh and Philippa boyens appeared to have differing interpretations of what constituted as the unifying element from the novel to guide the film. The end result incorporates various facets of the story with each one diluting and so harming the other.Alice Sebold's novel focused on the relationships in Susie's family the ones that had existed with her and how they changed and the relationships between her family when she died, while comparing them to how they had been. A second element due to the fact that Suzie narrates the story is her own world that she resides in, a world that is created as it seems from her perceptions in the old one, it gives clues of her hopes and dreams if she had lived, while being influenced by her moods from her witnessing events on earth. A third element is likened to crime mystery plot as she follows the happenings of her murderer as he covers up his crime, while her father and sister (And to a lesser extent the detectives) search for the truth.What makes the novel such a great experience does not lend itself to be captured by film for a similar result. Jackson and his writers could have chosen to explore one or two elements to greater success making it an easier task to film, but they chose the ambitious task of incorporating most of the stories facets, in an attempt to do the novel Justice. That's not to say that it is impossible to do this but rather in the attempt to achieve a great film the script has become disjointed and lacking cohesion, so that the lovely bones feels like three separate films. There are also some very stupid inclusions of scenes that change the tone and pace of the film abruptly, threatening to destroy the film altogether- The auntie's (Susan Sarandon) clean up the house routine and Susie's catwalk in heaven i can't believe that a director of Jackson's caliber would put that in there, i guess the difficulty of making this movie clouded his judgment more than i can imagine.Despite the major flaws of the film Jackson almost makes up for it with some incredible scenes that make you wonder what would have been if he a had gotten the script right. The suspense scenes building up to Susie's death and the flight of her sister Lindsey from her murderers' (Mr Harvey) house are exhilarating. likewise the scene in Harveys' bathroom while he washes himself after he has killed her is one of the most chilling i have seen. Jackson is also one of the best at extracting emotion from the audience, even in this film with its disjointed story by rights we shouldn't really be emotionally invested in the characters but shooting Susies's bones rolling in a safe down into the deep hole used for landfill all while cutting to her last experience on earth is very poignant.",The Lovely Bones
520,Irisballoon,Beautiful cinematography,9,29 August 2021,"I absolutely love this film. It captures the beauty of what in between heaven and earth are like or could be. Also the emotions are strong in this film. Great acting and the unsub or the perpetrator is spot on. I enjoyed this movie to its fullest. The scenes in this movie are breath taking and how the director shot it, the angles everything is on point. A 9/10 for sure in my book!!",The Lovely Bones
521,demystifield,"Despite the solid efforts made by Rachel Weisz, Stanley Tucci and Saoirse Roan, they still can't stop Peter Jackson from driving this film off a CGI Cliff.,",2,4 February 2010,"Peter Jackson's unhealthy obsession with CGI truly drives his film off a cliff in his poor adaptation of the novel ""The Lovely Bones"" Jackson forgoes the book's intelligence and intricate story and puts in an unhealthy obsession for the sensational that drives a wedged between his actors, who really are working with nothing and the viewer, who is left with a empty feeling after the film is over. The characters are nothing but objects for Jackson to manipulate in order to put in more CGI shots and their story is forfeited for a child like look into death, but with out the reality and complexity of the grieving process.Rachel Weisz, who is one of the most gifted and versatile actresses working today is giving little to do while in the book, her character is the most complex of the entire novel. Despite this, Weisz does a great job, giving the movie more heart and complexity with the little that she's given to work with than what the film does for itself, making a small dent in the parade of mindless CGI that Jackson puts on screen. Mark Wahlberg faces the same problem, giving a good performance that has no support from the director. Susan Sarandon does as much as humanly possible by giving humanity to her striped down and degraded character, who in the book is much more than the comic relief that Jackson tries to puts on screen and Stanley Tucci manages to give a tight performance as the creepy neighbor despite Jackson's unhealthy obsession to make him the main character of the film. Tucci brings dignity and substance to this character, while Jackson tries to exploit him. Last and not least, Saoirse Ronan does wonders with her role, which also stripped bare from the novel. Her character in the book had a complex innocents that had many layers of conflict while in the film, she's basically held as a angel in Peter Jackson's mind. Jackson puts on rosy color glasses when he deals with the character of Susie and that's where he goes really wrong because he does not make her a real person, he makes her an unreal angel that was with out fault.Peter Jackson not only hurts his own film but hurts the actors who made an effort to be faithful to the heart of the book as well, making this adaptation very painful to watch.",The Lovely Bones
522,centrumjuky,A lovely mess.,1,31 December 2009,"Director Peter Jackson's incoherent and ultimately pointless adaptation of the bestseller is just an intolerable mess from start to finish. Jackson manages to take a wonderful story about tragedy and grief and turn it to a carnival of incompetence and stupidity. Gone is the strong characterization that define each of the characters in the book and in its place is a sad spectacle of incompetence, with heavy handed CGI and bad scriptwriting that makes this film a real eye sore to sit through.I don't blame any of the actors involved in the movie because you can see how badly this film was edited in post production, making certain characters look foolish with out any reason and certain scenes that don't make any sense what so ever. You can see that the actors are really trying to their best and for the most part, they are able to succeed but its manly due to their professionalism than what they are working with, which is not much. Stanley Tucci gives an ounce of humanity to his character but that's mostly because he's a great actor, not because of the role which he had to work with. His character is so badly written in this film that he comes more across as a cartoon bad guy than the monster that was in the book. Stanley Tucci manages to give the viewer glimpses of heavy psychoses with his character but he's left out there by himself with no support from his director or the script which fails him every step of the way. Rachel Weisz struggles hard with her role, which was short changed by the director in the editing room in post production because he could not handle the plot line that her character has. A plot line which gave the original book a sense of reality and made the reader look into themselves as human beings and question their own selves on how far their grief can go. Unfortunately Jackson proves that he's not a mature enough filmmaker to answer those questions and Weisz and the viewer are left with little to related to. Rachel Weisz does manage to convey her character's dilemma quite well despite Jackson's immaturity (Which of course is more about Weisz being a great actress than the material and director she is working with), and by doing this, Weisz manages to give the viewer a glimpse of how good this film could have been if you had a director who was mature enough to handle the realities that the book presented to its readers. Saoirse Roan is left with really nothing to do other than run wild in a computerize playground that is supposed to be limbo. She tries her best, she really does but one gets the sense that most of her dramatic scenes were left on the editing room floor during post production as well. We can't connect with this little girl and that's the biggest crime of all because she's the murder victim. The book give you a complete picture of who this little girl is and it give you a real human being to care for, too bad the script for the movie does not. Susan Sarandon is left with a shallow version of her character, who was quite no nonsense and soulful in the book but is reduced to becoming a sad and awkward comic relief device thanks to Jackson, who left almost all of her dramatic scenes with the family on the cutting room floor. Susan still makes her character soulful but again, that's because she's a great actress, not from any help from the director or the script. Mark Wahlberg struggles very hard as well with what he has to work with and he does make a great effort, unfortunately, his character comes across more befuddled than assuring and the heavy editing and lackluster script leaves him out to dried as well along with the rest of the cast in this movie.No book can be faithfully adapted but they can at least have someone who care about its truthfulness to its core. Unfortunately,"" The Lovely Bones"" does not have that and despite the game effort by all the actors involved, its the director who ultimately sabotages this movie with his unwillingness to face its hard truths and we are left with a film that is shallow to its core.",The Lovely Bones

And believe me, these negative reviews are very valid. I thought the fact the movie got a rating of PG a dead give away they have ""Disney-ised"" this chilling story! If you have read the novel, you will be horribly disappointed. After the beginning of the movie, I felt as though I was waiting for something to happen, while we fly through graphically manufactured scenes, where nothing happens for nearly half an hour. This movie is meant to be a thriller, edge of your seat, holding your breathe while something happens. It wasn't. They have almost trivialised the whole point of this movie and the pedophilism associated with it, with happy little ""Heaven"" scenes running around smiling and laughing.

524,cybernetic-critic,Possibly Worst Movie Ever,1,16 January 2010,"Believe it or not I finally signed up to IMDb just to review this horrid movie.I spent the last 20 or so minutes of the movie just repeating in my head.. ""This is the worst movie I think I've ever seen... and I've seen a LOT of movies!"". By the end my eyes were watering.. not because of anything sad in the storyline but because my eyes were in disbelief that a movie could be this bad.At least with B movies, you know what you're getting going in. That's why this is much much worse than all B movies. This garbage was directed by Peter Jackson. Wow. I may never watch LoTR again in protest.I'm not really accustomed to writing reviews so it's hard for me to verbalize the incredible amount of disgust this movie had me feeling the whole way through but I'll try a bit anyway.All of the CGI sequences make you feel like you're in Candy Land or something instead of heaven or ""the in-between"". It was all so utterly ridiculous looking and feeling. Cheesy as hell comes to mind even for a kid's standards - Not that this movie was made for kids.There was really no suspense, action, drama, adventure.. or anything else you can really think of in this movie. I'm sure they'd classify it as a drama/suspenseful but it didn't feel dramatic or suspenseful it just felt lame.So many scenes in this movie completely enraged me. One that comes to mind is when she invades the killer's house, goes upstairs, and finds his notebook. She then hears him come home and shut the door. Then.. SHE PROCEEDS TO SLOWLY GO THROUGH EACH PAGE OF THE BOOK.. reading it on the floor, knowing he's in the house. Is this supposed to be suspense? It's actually just pure idiocy.I finally decided that it was possibly the worst movie I'd ever seen when she had taken the book from the house of the killer. The killer knew this and was actively chasing her. The notebook contained evidence that he killed her sister. So she then proceeds to run home with the book. When she gets home, instead of telling her family about it immediately like any normal HUMAN-BEING WOULD DO.. she sits there and walks around casually and quietly in her house letting many various less-important scenes play out while the child killer gets away! Once again, was this some kind of attempt at suspense.. waiting for her to tell her parents something super important??? It was not suspense for me.. I only felt hatred of the ridiculousness of the character and the whole scene.I've seen TV shows and movies in the past (The 80's) where there was a character who just should have or needed to say something extremely important to someone. They drag it on like it's some kind of suspense?? It's a terrible technique for movie-making. It's also frustrating and maddening to the viewer.I spent the remainder of the movie screaming in my head ""Will it ever end???"".Edit: I never read the book.",The Lovely Bones

528,milkyway9260,one of the best movies i've ever seen,10,5 August 2010,"This movie is probably one of the best movies I've ever seen in my entire life, and believe me I've seen A lot. It's one of those movies you have to watch over and over again. There's so much more emotion behind it then physical action. I understand that people don't like it, but I don't get why... Most people I talk to say because it's confusing and depressing or whatever; and yeah i can agree to the confusing parts because it's not a movie that TELLS you whats going on, it's a movie you have to pay attention to to understand the whats going on. It's one of those movies you have to think about. And it's honestly not depressing at all. I mean, the meaning of it is, a girl being raped and murdered; but the movie isn't about that, it's about her and her family trying to moving on, trying to get over a tragedy, to grow and move past it. That's the real meaning of the story.I'll admit that the first time you watch it, it probably won't make sense so you gotta watch it at least 2 to 3 times.The performances were fantastic, all the new comers were great, especially Saoirse Ronan, who plays Susie. There were a few parts where she was a bit stiff but other then that she was great. All the monologues in the movie plus her voice just sent shivers down my spine every time.It uses a lot of irony in the special effects, which I though was really cool; like the flame on the candle and the dead flower.I read the book and I thought it was okay, and usually I like the book better, but it just dragged on and on and on. And I personally think that a story like this, you understand it more by watching it then reading it. But read the book and watch the movie cause everyones got different opinions.Over all, a really really amazing movie.

529,clozz,My Favourite Film so Far...,10,22 July 2010,"Okay, It will take me a long time to write my full opinion on this film because I loved it soooooo much!!! But I'll say this; 1. I thought that (despite the critic's negative reviews)actually the film was directed well! Peter Jackson has developed Sebold's story in a very detailed, imaginative and beautiful way. And despite some negative comments that some elements weren't put into the film (For ex. the showing of the murder), I think it was best not to include those details, after all it IS a fourteen year old girl, and this film was not made to be a horror film. 2. I thought the acting was really really Great!! All of the actors did a splendid job, and I was especially impressed with Saoirse Ronan and Stanley Tucci (which I think most people would agree on). 3. I know people are mostly complaining about the CGI effects in this film and that there was too much, but I think that without those important clips showing Susie in her 'Inbetween' the film would not have been so (despite the grisly theme) uplifting, and it probably would be more depressing if Jackson had focused on the family more. 4. I thought contrasting music with the scenes in the film was also brilliant - it gave the film a more sad effect which made me cry each time. 5. And finally, what I loved most of all about the film, which didn't happen in the book was the innocence displayed throughout. The book I felt (although I enjoyed that too) was a bit more brutal and gruesome in my opinion.Overall, this is one of my favourite films, and I WOULD recommend it!!

My boyfriend had not read the book, but found the film as dull as I did.The visual effects when Susie is in ""limbo"" are stunning, however the original story is unfortunately completely lost.It was meant to be Susie getting murdered and the after-effects of her going missing and her family falling apart. All whilst Susie is watching and telling the story.Her family seem to cope okay in the film. Her mother's decline is so fast you almost miss it and her dad going slightly insane is also done within a blink of the eye. There were some complex characters in the book, who only had bit parts in the film (such as Ray Simgh and Ruth)and who were mentioned at the beginning then appeared near the end. It seemed like everything happened in a week, rather than over some years, as in the book.The film was cast well, although I find Mark Wahlberg very cheesy at times.Some of the music chosen was extremely cheesy, which made me laugh and feel slightly embarrassed to be watching it! This film could have been made so much better by just exploring the characters more, but unfortunately most of the time was obviously spent on creating stunning visual effects, which, although were amazing, still did not necessarily look like as described in the book.This might be a good film to see if you haven't read the book (although my boyf. didn't enjoy it), but for me it was a complete wash-out.",The Lovely Bones

The dead girl's heavenly acquaintances serve no useful purpose. And the murderer's ending offers absolutely no sense of closure.

There were a lot of heart touching moments in the movie that I couldn't stop my tears. Yes, this movie did make me cry which is not very common with me because I am more of a horror movie fan. I'd like to recommend this title to anyone who haven't watched it yet even if you are not much of a fan of movies of this genre cause I can assure you that if I can like this movie being a fan of totally different genre than even you will like it.Lastly YES this movie did touch my heart. THIS MOVIE IS AMONG THE RARE BREED OF MOVIES WHICH ARE VERY DIFFICULT TO FIND.",The Lovely Bones

It makes me cry every time that I watch it, with both happy and sad tears. It was very enjoyable and kept me watching with interest. The acting was very impressive. Going back and forth between between Susie's experiences and her family and her murder was very well done. The actress playing Susie was very convincing. Several times I felt that the actress was truly upset.I enjoy how the different stories of other girl's murders were added during the movie. I believe it would have been better if they had shown more settings. It was still pretty good.",The Lovely Bones
536,Metahelix,"Heart-wrenching, uplifting, captivating & hauntingly beautiful",10,24 September 2011,"A very unconventional movie that crosses many genres (murder/suspense/thriller/drama/fantasy), defies normal expectations and is an intense emotional experience. Right from the outset you are informed of when the lead character will be murdered and who her killer is but you are still kept on the edge of your seat and surprised by later revelations. The story dovetails between reality (before and after the murder) and a surreal afterlife realm in between Heaven and Earth. Despite the tragic, heart-wrenching and dark subject matter, the film is uplifting, captivating and hauntingly beautiful throughout. As the credits rolled, I ran through a gamut of emotion and found aspects of the film resonated with me long after. It is difficult to conceive as to why this movie was critically panned. I can only surmise that either the story didn't follow the source material closely (I have not read the book) or viewers didn't appreciate the story being told from the perspective of a 13 year old girl or critics were just being spiteful towards a successful director (Directed by Peter Jackson and produced by Steven Spielberg).PROS(a) Original, imaginative, creative story / screenplay. (b) Authentic, well-drawn, endearing characters. (c) Thrilling & entertaining from start to finish. (d) A visual masterpiece - both from a cinematic perspective and a CGI/special effects perspective. Definitely warrants viewing in HD (Blu-Ray). (e) Superlative lead actors: Saoirse Ronan, Stanley Tucci. (f) Solid supporting actors: Susan Sarandon, Rachel Weisz, Mark Wahlberg. (g) Subtle but powerful soundtrack. (h) Thematically rich and filled with symbolism & metaphors.CONS(a) Childhood romantic relationships seem forced and only marginally believable. (b) Film appears to be heavily edited due to the long running time. Certain characters, scenes, and threads could have been fleshed out more. (c) The clairvoyant girl (Ruth) was a bit cliché & one-dimension. (d) Adequate resolution of killer's fate but not deeply satisfying.",The Lovely Bones

538,xzarkad,enchanting....with a smile and a tear...,9,5 March 2010,"This is my first review, but I had no other option than to share my view after seeing such a wonderful, emotional movie.Is there CGI in this film: yes. Is there too much CGI: no! I estimate that the total of CGI scenes are lesser than 10 minutes. The CGI do contribute to the film and are only in a supporting role, only to visualize scenes/situations Suzie encounters.Back to the movie: this is quite an intense, emotional movie. It is not all about the horrible situation that happens to Suzie, but also to the emotions both victim and her family have to deal with. Peter Jackson was clever enough not to show this pain, blood and horror, where other directors might have done so. Instead, Jackson choose not to show the horrible event. As a result the murder of a young girl & daughter is probably even more intense.All actors perform to the best of their abilities...and there is quite a lot of talent amongst these actors. Mark, Susan and Rachel really contribute in lifting this movie above average. But the real star of this movie remains Saoirse Ronan.I can only advice to go out and see this movie. It is one of those rare gems, you only encounter every few years.",The Lovely Bones
539,FrankenMonkey,A disjointed mess,3,12 February 2013,"I just caught this movie on Netflix after being intrigued by the trailers back when it hit theaters. I had never read the book and, quite frankly, it shouldn't be necessary. However, after watching this film, I feel that the only people who could have understood the point of this film are those who read the book.A hallmark of a good film is the ability to make the audience empathize with the characters, often by taking the audience on the same emotional journey which the character(s) embark. I feel like this is what Jackson attempted to do but regrettably failed. The audience is left wandering back and forth through the story and wondering what exactly is going on and why people are doing the things they're doing. It isn't until the end that Jackson reveals the meaning of the title and, by extension, the film: The Lovely Bones are the bonds that are formed between people in the wake of a tragedy. It is further wrapped in theme of acceptance in the absence of closure.When reflecting on the film one wonders how anything that happens in it supports the notion that Lovely Bones are formed between anyone. What relationships are truly formed and cultivated in the film? Jack (Mark Wahlberg) embarks on a personal crusade to find the murderer and his daughter's remains. Despite the film's overarching theme of acceptance over closure, Jack's quest is in fact validated when he correctly identifies the murderer on his own and then by his daughter, Lindsey. However, on this journey, it is hard to identify the ""Lovely Bones"" formed with anyone around him. Perhaps Detective Fenerman? Although, beyond a hug and proclamation that ""You've always been a good friend"", the audience is never offered any evidence to support this notion. Movies are visual. Don't tell us you're friends, show us you're friends. Jack's journey is completely mishandled by everyone of the filmmakers, most notably Wahlberg who hasn't been this bad since The Happening.This is just one of many examples where the characters simply don't stay true to the point. The mother leaves her family in crises in order to pick fruit in California, and action that makes it difficult to form stronger bonds with family and friends. In fact, none of the family members appear to care that Mom is gone. Grandma Lynn gets a whole montage dedicated to her and then completely disappears from the film. She seemed to be around her grandson, Buckley, a bit but they never have a strong emotional connection. Buckley confesses Susie entered his room and kissed him goodnight to his father, but this is an act that should have been reserved for Grandma Lynn if the filmmakers wished to establish an emotional tie between the two. Lindsey gets a boyfriend, but the audience never really sees the romance that culminates in an exchange of necklaces. Finally, Susie is all over the place emotionally. One moment she's scared, then she's frolicking, then she's angry, then she's happy, then she's sad. The audience never really knows why because it's unclear what she's trying to do. Is she trying to find her murderer? Is she trying to communicate with her family? Is she trying to move on? It's never revealed, but presumably kissing her dreamboat gave her closure she needed to move on. The seen is sweet, but I couldn't help but wonder why, after the kiss, she didn't say ""Oh, by the way, my murderer put my body in a safe and he's right outside trying to push it into a landfill. Thanks. See you in the next life!"" Perhaps the great tragedy of this film is the fact that the best performance is the most useless. Stanley Tucci as Harvey is wonderfully creepy, but his character is a distraction from the Lovely Bones. So much time and effort is dedicated to a character that serves no purpose to what the film is purportedly about: forming relationships in the wake of tragedy. I think this film would have been considerably better had his character been completely written out of the film. The time devoted to needlessly following Harvey would have been better served developing The Lovely Bones between the rest of the cast. Susie disappears and is presumed dead; dad searches for her frantically to no avail but befriends Detective Fenerman along the way; Lindsey's grief is assuaged by a budding relationship with a boy; Grandma Lynn and Buckley support one another in the grieving process; Ray and Ruth find one another; Susie witnesses all this and finds meaning in her death before moving on to the next life; and mom.... well, mom has to stay home. THIS is the point of the film. Harvey has no place in it. If the audience has no murderer, then they too will feel the same hopelessness experienced by the characters. Instead, they are treated to a hodgepodge of random events glossed over by some pretty CGI.",The Lovely Bones
540,rosscreations,Had a lot of potential.,6,2 June 2020,"I've only seen the movie and not read the book so this review does not compare the two. The movie ALMOST really touches me. Suzie is in pergatory and her actions there are supposedly impacting the choices of some of the living, but I didn't see it.The most frustrating scene in any movie I've ever seen in my life was when Suzie's sister finds the killers book, runs home frantically, finally finds her dad and right when she SHOULD tell him... the movie tries for some ""touching"" family reunion between her dad and mom. I was actually yelling at the tv in anger of this. The mom had been gone for a small amount of time, so it was not a big deal to me. Suzie's dad who'd been relentlessly searching for her killer is totally jipped because his other daughter, who was courageous and a great character turns into an absolute moron at the most important moment in the movie. I don't give a crap about the dad and mom seeing each other after being separated for a week? Two weeks? A month? They were never really close anyway and the mom never supported her husband's search for Suzie. This scene alone almost ruins the whole movie.Another frustrating thing to me was the fact that Suzie's dad, a smart guy, an accountant being so determined to find the killer, looked into bank records and taxes of suspects, then ultimately uses a baseball bat when following his last suspect like a complete meat head and obviously fails.
In the end, the movie absolutely does not satisfy. I wasn't even looking for the happiest of endings but Suzie's body isn't even found (yet someone watches it being dumped and faints). The police find out who the killer is, then he dies of natural causes. Nevermind Suzie's father being the one exact revenge and kill him, NO ONE EVEN FINDS THE KILLERS BODY. The resolution is horrendous.With these frustrations being the case, the movie was still somewhat enjoyable and beautiful. I had absolutely no problem with the cgi. The characters acting was incredible. The killer had a warm/friendly personality which was really interesting. Suzie was adorable and her finally kissing her crush was cute, yet sad. The movie really made me consider how short life can be and how incredibly sad someone being murdered before they've even lived it is.Worth a watch if you know to expect not to be satisfied. Great story with terrible climaxes.",The Lovely Bones
541,matmag361-365-953102,Unexpectedly Good,7,8 May 2012,"OK, parts of this are ""Ghost Whisperer"" writ large, but the fine acting, outstanding cinematography and direction by Peter Jackson make this a worthwhile experience. I had thrown this in my Netflix queue a long time ago, and by the time I got it, I had read some reviews that led me to believe that I would find this boring and trite. Well, it held my interest and was even a bit moving at times. I'm not so much impressed by the story it told as by the overall impact of the various elements that successfully came together to make this film work.This film is occasionally tagged as a ""supernatural thriller"" , or as being particularly gory.

542,LoopyCheshireCat,Ugh,3,29 April 2010,"The question I have is how can they say that they made ""The Lovely Bones"" into a movie when the story was barely left intact. Not only were there numerous things either changed or left out, but I feel that the essence of the story was lost as well. The point of the story is that a girl watches her family and her killer from heaven while she struggles to come to terms with what happened. It seems that the parts where she is in heaven she is either frolicking through a field or she is wondering what is in the lighthouse. The point of her being there was that she spent most of her time watching her family because she just couldn't let them go. This gets completely lost in the movie. And the parts where it is with her family it seems like a whodunnit case. Once again, this wasn't the point. On Earth Susie sees her family torn apart by the tragedy. The ending...oh god the ending. I won't go into it in case there are people who haven't seen it but it was complete crap. I understand that making a book into a movie is difficult and often things may need to be changed or cut out, but Peter Jackson destroyed the integrity of the story.

544,dhartzell,It's OK to be brutally murdered. Really.,4,23 January 2010,"I didn't read The Lovely Bones when it was published, but like anyone who follows books I was familiar with its chillingly improbable premise: a girl dispassionately recounting her murder and its aftermath. You can't help wondering what the point is, unless you're a deeply religious Christian who considers the trials and tribulations of life on Earth to be merely a brief pilgrimage to the Great Reward Beyond. But this book wasn't issued by a deep south religious publisher like Thomas Nelson, so it couldn't be about that ... could it? I'm sure Peter Jackson didn't think so, because the Christian fundamentalist market wouldn't be big enough box office to guarantee a profit on this startlingly gargantuan effort. As a narrative The Lovely Bones seems very much removed from the panoramic scale and sweep demanded by effects-intensive sagas like Lord of the Rings or King Kong. But Bones makes it clear that Jackson isn't comfortable doing without CGI. As he envisioned it, the story offered rich opportunities to put dozens of graphics effects artists to work realizing a verdant, craggy, mountainous, oceanic, running-through-the-rye kind of otherworld that, while it avoids the cotton-ball clouds and angels-strumming-harps we think of as typical Hollywood shorthand for heaven, often veers towards a Daliesque (or maybe I should say Tim-Burtonesque) surrealism that takes over the story and makes the earthbound characters' concerns (assuming we haven't forgotten them entirely) seem not only trivial but oddly irrelevant.Which is a shame, because when Jackson tires of his effects-driven heaven he gets back to the story of how the dead Susie still possesses the will and the power to influence the behavior of her live family. There's nothing unconventional about this idea, of course -- it's a standard conceit in movies ranging from Topper to Ghost. But unlike Jackson's scenes of heaven, which often go on a bit to no particular end, Susie's spiritual visits to Earth and her family propel the story forward and sometimes take them -- and us -- in unexpected directions. And they make plain dramatic sense in a way that Susie's through-the-looking-glass afterlife mostly doesn't.Still, by the end of the movie, after we've experienced the static, somewhat sanitized tableaux of the violent murders Stanley Tucci's pedophile has committed (the movie has nothing to say about the far more troubling subject of extreme sexual deviancy; Tucci's pervert here is reduced to that standard horror device: a serial killer) you can't help feeling you're being asked to admit that the devious violent terrors lurking around the corner from the world's Stanley Tuccis is a small price to pay for the wonderful CGI heaven that awaits. And anyway, just as serial killers effectively pick their victims at random -- so Mom and Dad, please don't beat yourselves up for failing to stop him! -- so random events eventually do those nasty serial killers in. (Thanks, Mr. Icicle and Mr. Sheer Cliff!) Don't you feel better now? I didn't. Although I admit that, a full day after seeing it, I'm still struggling to make sense of The Lovely Bones.

The acting was fine, everyone did a good job on that end, but the cut scenes to the acid trip land of Susie Salmon's ""Heaven"" were a waste of time. She never did anything there that impacted the story line. At least in ""What Dreams May Come"" there was a point to it. So here are some highlights of lack of logic and frustration for me:- Watching Mark Wahlberg, who they couldn't hide his frame under the 70's shirts, get beat up by a wimpy high schooler was completely bogus! - The ending with the icicle causing the killer to trip and fall off a cliff was horrible, watching Mark beat the crap out of him and throw him off a cliff would have been much better. - The LSD trip scenes of heaven were just plain boring. If Susie could have actually done anything to help her family that would have been good. - Mark's character welcoming his wife back after however long she had wimped out on her family was pretty bogus. - Mark's daughter holding the book of the killer to see his mom and dad have some fairy tale greeting and not saying, ""Look, I found her killer, and he almost got me and may try again...Oh hi mom!"" was completely stupid. - Many more...Good points (I could only come up with one): - I liked them not going into details of the murder, who needs to have their mind filled with junk like that.

The acting was top notch and some of the images from the ""in between"" are stunning. The masterful development of Susie's character before her death make the unthinkable details of her death even harder to accept.

554,Blasph23,An emotional dispute about death. From both perspectives.,7,6 February 2011,"To be honest I only decided to watch this because of the director. Being a big fan of LotR as well as Peter Jackson, I was really curious as to what kind of movie this would be. I was really hoping for something above and beyond a simple serial murderer movie, and that's precisely what I got. The film set the pace at the very beginning. The careful narration and focus on details that often didn't have anything to do with the main plot was very suggestive, as was the running time. 2 hours is quite long for a movie of this kind, but since I like a slow, brooding atmosphere, this suited my taste perfectly. Acting was really good, although I wouldn't say that anybody was particularly outstanding. Both Susie and her murderer were played in a unique way that made them stand out as action focusing figures within the plot, but as far as pure acting skill goes, there was little to truly grab my attention. Still, a job done well on both fronts. Rachel Weisz was good as always, Mark Wahlberg surprisingly warm and tender, especially since the last movie with him that I saw was Departed, and he was anything but gentle. Susan Sarandon playing a toxic grandmother was fun to watch. Camera work was very well handled. I must say I grew tired of both the Bourne-style shaky cam (which wouldn't fit this piece anyway) as well as too stationary, document-like style also abundant in today's movies. Mostly smooth panning, matching the pace of the movie and making it perfectly possible to focus on the slowly evolving plot. It gives you the time to absorb the content spilling out of the screen, to think it through, analyze the image. Maybe even for a second or two disappear in your own world picturing yourself as a deceased person watching his or her grieving family, without losing anything of the movie, yet getting a better feel and almost experiencing the atmosphere. Superb camera work in my opinion.CGI were very well dosed. I'm not going to comment on the quality since this movie's special effects did not lack anything, but the images of a dream-like afterlife were both captivating and convincing. One can of course only guess what it really looks like, but it might as well be this unreal world devoid of physics and reason. As for the music, it was very delicate, emotional, subtle. It matched the camera work as well as the generally slow tempo of the film and helped induce the right 'feel' as well as being simply a beautiful addition to the whole, at times easing the tension, and in a next scene building up the events leading to a culminating point. As for the plot, it was for a large part a text book serial killing. No big surprises here, although I didn't really expect any. I was more interested in what the afterlife looks like, even if from a perspective of a teenage girl that didn't exactly see much of the world and is probably making up a lot of what she sees, drawing from her own limited memories. The family's reaction to a beloved one's death, the grief, the pain, it was well portrayed. Looking around seeing things that remind them of her, smashing the bottle ships, remembering the last words of their daughter, about her talent going to waste and thinking over and over again about what could have they done better, said differently, about all those pictures she took with the camera. At the same time seeing snapshots of the murderer and not being sure what does he feel, what does he think. For a long time none of his real emotions surface, he remains steady and secure. Only after a while we see him feel something. What is it? That's difficult to say, but again this is not exactly important. Justice will be dealt somehow, that was my belief. Still, at some point past the middle of the film, I had the feeling that somebody wanted it to be long but lost the idea of how to do that. It felt unnaturally prolonged at that point and this is technically my only complaint. I would like to see some more of the afterlife world or maybe additional details covering the investigation, or maybe the murderer's remorse or at least doubts surfacing somehow. Instead, for a moment I wasn't sure what I'm watching. As if waiting for something, and then suddenly seeing her father slowly getting the idea of his neighbor being responsible, while helping him built a garden shack for his other daughter (sic!). It seemed stretched, I was half expecting some more real world input from his dead daughter, directing him somehow to the truth, paining on the windows, showing the locations of bodies or leading him to find the small, metal house off of her bracelet which we often saw the murderer twirl between his fingers, but no such thing actually happened. Maybe I was expecting a more typical, cliché way of resolving this murder case, simply due to having seen many similar movies, when in fact that's not what the movie was about. We do see him finally being exposed, but at the point when his crimes are revealed, Suzie doesn't care anymore. She just wants to complete the last chapter of her life and take off to wherever she went. Move on. Maybe that's what this was all about. Let the family forget and live. Let her forget and leave.All in all, a decent, emotional and brooding film, asking some important questions about our own approach to death. Not just as the ones that lose their beloved, but also as the grim reaper's subjects, which, essentially, we all are.",The Lovely Bones

557,robotclam-1,Dead on arrival.,2,31 December 2009,"How bad is this movie? How high is the sky? I was no fan of the book, but after being bludgeoned by Peter Jackson's grotesque acid trip, I've come to appreciate the novel's delicacy. The movie really needed someone who appreciates subtlety and nuance, like Terrence Malick, maybe; instead, we get a director who never met a wide-angle lens or garish CGI effect he didn't like. Quick checklist of everything wrong with this movie: (1) Casting. Saoirse Ronan is precious, in the worst sense of the word, and Rachel Weisz and Mark Wahlberg are just awkward, uncomfortable, miscast. Susan Sarandon grandstands in a hackneyed part. Only Stanley Tucci impresses. (2) Art and production design -- Seventies overkill. Everyone's clothes are too bright and clean, and the wigs the adults have to wear are just amateurish and awful. (3) Music. Brian Eno's original music is nice, but most of the score just pillages his back catalogue. It's nice to hear that great music again, but it's an awkward fit for the movie, and lazy too. Half a point for inserting a This Mortal Coil song at the climax, but it overpowers the scene, robs it of any real power. (4) The biggest problem, overall, is that in a movie that runs well over two hours, Jackson is so busy bombarding us with trippy post-death visuals that he forgot to include actual human relationships. There are maybe fifteen minutes of actual conversation between characters in the entire movie -- and believe me, I'm not exaggerating. Everything else is given over to our perky dead girl running through CGI mountains and fields, or observing her mopey family, while the ponderous, constant, droning narration makes the whole thing feel like an illustrated audiobook. The movie is so drained of drama, so lacking in even rudimentary story construction, that it quickly becomes tedious. I wish Peter Jackson would stick with giant monkeys and hobbits. He has no concept of how people behave. And I fervently pray that there is no CGI in heaven.",The Lovely Bones

It felt like one minute I was seeing a girl run around in a purple field and then the next a grieving father was convinced his neighbour had murdered his daughter, I couldn't see the connection between the 'two worlds' and maybe this is just because this book wasn't meant for the big screen.
I was also upset with the lack of resolution. The movie didn't portray exactly what Susie was waiting around for because the family weren't going to make peace with what happened and her murdered basically got off scot free.",The Lovely Bones

563,stabbedismyname,Phoned-in Adaptation of a Good Book,2,20 January 2010,"I do not understand how a powerhouse director like Peter Jackson could make such a film school drop out amazingly mundane movie. This film should either not exist or should be done COMPLETELY DIFFERENTLY. I read about 2/3 of the book before I saw this movie and nothing the book did well was conveyed in the movie. For instance, the scene where Suzie is murdered is completely non-existent. In the film her character simply gets away free and then realizes that her freedom is a dream and she is actually dead. In the book the murder is described in bone chilling detail and it works well, but this adaptation (possibly done this way to avoid an R rating) makes the scene almost completely pointless and forgettable.Another thing that really is my main complaint is that there is no feeling behind the movie and no attachment is built between the watcher and the characters. I can't even pretend to care about the well being of the characters because Jackson doesn't make me feel like I even know them at all. Every single person in the movie has way too much time spent on them, with the exception of Suzie who has too little time spent on her. This spending of too much time on characters makes it so that the important characters actually has too little time spent on them. Mark Wahlberg's performance is one of the worst I've ever seen from him, as is the case with Rachel Weisz, and I'm not sure they weren't just sticking with the terrible script that tried to make a hideous collage out of some pieces of the book they remembered.Also the heaven scenes that were very interesting in the book are transformed into a two or three minute montage of stupidity in the film. The way these scenes are executed is hard to explain, but once you see it you realize how ridiculous and shallow they are. The cinematography is really annoying as well. It is choppy, and comically close up a lot of the time. The entire screen will be filled up with someone's face or an extreme close up of a finger, and trust me it is a pain to watch. The CGI is, like another reviewer said, the stuff of commercials or worse. There is literally almost nothing good to say about this movie, save one: The actress who plays Suzie is clearly talent hidden behind the opaque sheet that is this movie. I really hope this disaster does not hinder her on future projects because she has a lot of talent for her age and I could see it even in spite of one of the worst executed movies I've ever had the misfortune of seeing in theaters in several years.",The Lovely Bones

565,supermandumas,Lovely & Beautiful,10,17 January 2010,"The Lovely Bones seems to have let down many critics nationwide, but despite their disapproval, I believe that Peter Jackson's adaptation of Alice Sebold's novel is both beautiful and touching. This film easily ranks in my top ten films of all time, and despite its pitfalls, I was utterly moved. I am a film student attending university, so I've seen many, many films, both classics and modern blockbusters, and The Lovely Bones, though not flawless, did not disappoint me. This film is a true wonder of the new decade. The end of the film was one of the most beautiful endings I've seen in a film in quite a while.Saoirse Ronan, as Peter Jackson promised, truly carries us through this film. Her acting performance as the iconic character Susie Salmon should be commended (and she certainly deserved the Critic's Choice Award for Best Young Actor/Actress). Stanley Tucci's portrayal of the murderer Mr. Harvey adds a hauntingly convincing and quite frightening aspect to the film. Susan Sarandon is hilarious as Grandma Lynn, Mark Wahlberg shows us how far a father will go for justice in the face of what has happened to his daughter, and Rachel Weisz could not have been better--her bittersweet, subtle performance as Abigail Salmon resonated quite well with my vision of a mother left to wallow in the wake of tragedy.Yes, if I had been the filmmaker behind The Lovely Bones, I would probably have done the heaven scenes a bit differently. There were several scenes--in the cornfield, on the lake, in the snowy mountains--that were beautiful and nearly perfect; at the same time, there were others I would've either not included or done a bit differently.This truly is a beautiful film, and I hope that Susie Salmon tugs at your heartstrings the way she tugged at mine. See it for yourself and then take your own stance on what you believe are its merits and its pitfalls.A lovely movie. Not many movies are completely flawless (in fact, none may be), so I give it ten stars out of ten.",The Lovely Bones
566,di_n_wood,The story of many lives,9,3 October 2021,"I want to start with a fact that I watched this movie twice. For the first time I watched it as a teenager and the only two things I remembered were a nonstandard plot and a creepy moustache of one of the main characters. I watched it for the second time a week ago, after reading an original book, and I couldn't hold back my tears.The plot is based on the 2002 bestseller ""The Lovely Bones"" by Alice Sebold. It tells us a story of Susie Salmon, a 14-year-old girl who is murdered and... gets to her personal Heaven. From there she watches her family trying to cope with their loss and learning to live without her. As well as the man, who took her life so brutally. Peter Jackson once again does a great job as a film director, as he manages to make this story both realistic and gripping. The atmosphere of a little American town of the mid-1970's looks accurate and believable as well as the fantastic dream-like Heaven scenes. Moreover, I appreciate the work of screenwriters who have adapted the novel with such competence and respect to the original piece.Another great thing in this movie is a cast. Susie Salmon is portrayed by incredible Saoirse Ronan, who is literally perfect for this role. And Stanley Tucci is a great fit for heinous and cruel George Harvey. The performance of others (Mark Wahlberg, Rachel Weisz, Susan Sarandon and many more) is also on point, I have no other words.Overall, I can say that ""The Lovely Bones"" is an amazing and moving film (even though it is much less explicit than the original novel). It might be too much for sensitive and emotional people, but if you want a good thought-provoking movie, it is the right option. It is a horrific, but at the same time beautiful story about real life and real people; about our losses and our findings.",The Lovely Bones

Watching the struggle of all the good people around this bad source of evil is something to pay attention to as his character I believe it to be well depicted therefore something we can all learn from.

The ""In-Between"" was adapted nicely from Sebold's book to the screen. The colors were very vibrant and beautiful. And throughout the entire film, the audience felt fear, hope, horror, relief.I will admit that I was a little disappointed at first at how coy the murder scene was, but, looking back, I appreciate how much PJ played around the edges.

I figured it would be basically a murder mystery with a bit of a supernatural twist to it (plus it has Mark Wahlburg in it, which is usually a good sign). sounds good, right? Wrong.I thought the whole story was forced, a bit cheesy, and overall painful to watch. The attempts at ""tear-jearking"" were laughable at best (literally, i was laughing in the theater while the supposedly emotional final scene was playing). the narration was absurd and annoying, the premise was flawed, and and the ""symbolism"" was just corny. the ending left you feeling unfulfilled at best. And really, WHY do they tell you who the killer is within the first few they tell you who the killer is in the first fifteen minutes or so, which totally takes away from the whole murder-mystery aspect of things.Just my 2 cents. all in all, 2.5 stars out of 10.

I find it very hard to believe that people have a hard time relating to the characters because they're not being developed enough. The idea is simple, what would you do if a young female family member was murdered?? Do you really need ""better writing"" to put you in that frame of mind? The answer is NO!! If you're not a fan of PJ and you think his character development needs to get better, maybe you need step outside your tiny box and put yourselves in that exact scenario and tell me what you would've done differently in their place. It's a stretch but I do believe you will enjoy this movie and many other movies if you practice this.This isn't the book. If you want the story from the book, GO READ THE BOOK. That's why it's ""based"" on the book, not, Alice Sebold's: The Lovely Bones.I do understand if you don't agree with PJ's version of Heaven or in-between. As a Christian, I do believe in Heaven and I don't think it will be like that. But I also agree that it is a personalized utopia in the afterlife. If you, as the audience member, can grasp your mind around these things which many previous viewers could not, I do believe you will see this movie for what it was meant to be, a wonderful war between excepting your mortality (in this case, already occurred death) and moving on to leave your loved ones behind so they, in turn, can move on as well and not wanting to abandon the family that misses you so.Please see the movie, but do so with an open mind and an open heart.",The Lovely Bones

Unfortunately, Peter Jackson betrays his lack of confidence in the source material and decides to do a movie that is inspired by rather than based on the book. He goes for feelings and emotions brought about by imagery rather than actual drama. The drama never really has a chance to develop in this cut and paste version of the book. All of the meaningful dialogue from the book is absent from the film, and the narration bears little resemblance to Sebold's novel except for the discussion about the ""lovely bones"" that Susie has left behind. For those looking for superior adaptations of books that feel more like live performances of the material and not ""inspired by"" roller coaster rides, I'd recommend movies like ""High Fidelity"" or ""Thank You for Smoking"" where the writers actually treat their source material with respect, unlike this CGI blunder.",The Lovely Bones

And after watching 2/3 of it, I expected to love it, despite unlikely events and overuse of CGI.However, the movie has some problems making it not that good.

There is a girl who can see the dead, however she play no significant role in the story.Also, Susie's communication with the real world serves no purpose.

Was I wonderfully surprised.Peter Jackson does carry an awful lot of weight (a reason I decided to watch the movie in the first place), as I loved the recent 'District 9', so I was hoping this would not be a complete mess.And what a joy it is. AGain for those who have not read the book. Most of the reviews posted are complaints from the book fans who feel cheated, and understandably so, but how is a whole book meant to be translated into a two hour movie? Something has to give and that something is always the storyline. And trust me, this is a pretty long movie.Anyways, if you haven't read the book, I cannot recommend this movie HIGHLY ENOUGH. It blew me away and as a guy, I cried my heart out, thats saying something. And I have no idea what the complaints about special effects are, they are lovely and so beautiful, loved them (probably the book lovers finding excuses to bring the movie down). My criticism is mainly the acting, Saoirse Ronan does a wonderful job as Susie, as is Stanley Tucci, however, its the parents who couldn't pull their weight, thats Mark Wahlberg & Rachel Weisz. Rachel was specially awful and most disappointing for me.So, for the last time, if you have read the book, best steer clear as the movie can never be faithful to the book, however, if you haven't read the book and are looking for a wonderfully original story, beautifully delivered, check out 'The Lovely Bones'.THis is already my top candidate for the movie of the year, heck, make that this year and 2009!",The Lovely Bones
579,mmmorgan,"Brilliant, but Not For Everyone",9,27 April 2010,"Based on the thorough thrashing this movie has received from other reviewers, I came with few expectations. Movies based on novels are, after all, often difficult to put together in a way that is satisfying to readers yet visually engaging. On this note I must disagree with the negative reviews and nay-sayers: Jackson has succeeded in both stunning me visually (hard to do, as I'm an artist and therefore picky) and thoroughly tugging my heartstrings. I found myself in tears during easily one third of the movie. Although I am an emotional person, I strongly disagree that The Lovely Bones bears much resemblance to a made-for-TV melodrama.I gave it a 9/10 because it is not perfect. There are a few elements that could have been better developed, such as the relationship that grows between Susie's younger brother Buckley and their bereaved father. However, Jackson chose to focus almost completely on Susie's dilemma in the afterlife as she watches her family grieve and her killer become maddeningly arrogant in his ability to duck and cover.It is this reviewer's opinion that if you came to The Lovely Bones expecting a gruesome rape scene along the lines of A Time to Kill, you were disappointed. (Jackson expressed dismay that his viewers would even WANT to witness a 14-year-old girl being raped and murdered, stating that he had no desire to portray such and never will.) This movie will not appeal to males in general, particularly under the age of twenty-five, for what should be obvious reasons. It is about a young girl whose life was stolen from her. She therefore has a young girl's feelings, hopes, and fantasies. If you can't relate to those emotions, then you probably won't like this movie. If you can't be touched by the powerful imagery the CGI in the movie provides, you probably won't like this movie. There are straightforward, A to Z movies that tell their stories step-by-step from beginning to end (plot-driven), and then there are movies that weave a tale around the emotions and struggles of their characters (character-driven). This movie is one of the latter, and if you don't like that kind, then you probably won't enjoy it. Furthermore, a character-driven tale based on a novel in which every character receives as much screen time as it did page time ends up becoming epic in length. I marathon-read the book in one day. How long does a movie based on it need to be in order to accurately establish the core plot?In summary, if you can allow Jackson's special effects to blow you away, as was intended, and if you can approach it with an open heart, then you're in for a real treat in The Lovely Bones. It was elegantly done and very entertaining -- to the right person.",The Lovely Bones

SO, heres a review of someone who thought it was one of the best movies he's ever seen.People have a thing against the CGI in almost-heaven (in between place whatever). WELL in the book it changes according to her imagination and peoples imaginations are a crazy intense place, so obviously CGI is needed when it comes to putting most peoples craziest worlds inside their head to life.Story was was perfectly dark but with heart to it. I guess all the fans of the book weren't pleased with the movie because it takes way to much out of the book. WELL it went on for 2 hours and like 20 min. Peter Jackson obviously wanted to get as much in as he could from the book. Plus thats his style.The acting was perfect, specially the very emotional scene of the parents trying to comfort each other in bed, like they were in so much pain they had no control over it. It just felt real.The music was also Perfect and I'm the kind of person who cares a lot about the music the use in movies.

From it's title we had imagined an inspired, supernatural tale of a dead girl who cleverly manages to inform her grieving parents/postman/cat of her death, kicking some murdering scumbag's ass in the process. Having stayed up late in anticipation, I was made to wish that my misses hadn't woken me out of my boredom induced stupor having falling asleep half-way through it. In all my years of watching movies - and I've seen many - I have never seen such ocular scorching drivel as 'The Lovely Bones' turned out to be. We tried giving it a chance - we really did and through my limited but ongoing training as a screenwriter, tried reading into the analagous dream sequences, plot points, climactic events and inciting indents only to come to the conclusion the Peter Jackson's 'Lovely Bones' is actually a steaming pile of the proverbial. I'm not going to bother going into detail with all that is wrong with this film, suffice to say that the final scene where the paedo killer rolls the dead girl down into a pit is completely ridiculous when you consider that it takes two them to roll the trunk down a muddy slope but on his own, he's managed to get this trunk full of dead girl onto the back of his trailer and burn rubber in record time having been busted by her sister minutes before. Fascinating, complete rubbish and one of the worse films I've ever seen in my life bearing in mind I've seen a lot! All I can say is if you're thinking about going to see this film, stop now, and if you absolutely can't help yourself because you're basically an idiot, take a box of matches, some lighter fuel, a taser gun and a friend and spend the evening electrocuting each other and setting each other's farts alight in the movie theatre cos that's gonna be more interesting than what you'll see on screen. Yes people, you're better off going to watch 'Jackass' the movie and we all know how educational that is.",The Lovely Bones
584,chris-renfrey,Honest and Hard Hitting,9,15 February 2010,"First of all, I would like to stress the point that I don't believe there is such a thing as a 10/10 when it comes to rating movies, otherwise, that movie would be perfect, and I would never want to see another movie again. Therefore, the 9/10 that I give this movie is one of the highest ratings I could give a movie.I walked in to the cinema having no idea what to expect from this movie, and I suggest anyone who wants to appreciate the movie do the same. In other words, ignore all of the reviews, hell, even ignore this one! This is the kind of movie that will hit some people, and miss others. I urge you to see it and decide for yourself.Generally, something needs to be pretty damn honest or horrific to stick in my mind long after the movie has gone, and even now, 2 weeks after having seen the movie (I rarely remember things for 2 minutes, let alone 2 weeks!) I can still recall most of the movie fairly well.Personally, 2 scenes that stick out to me more than anything else are shortly after Susie's death, being the muddy, bloody bathroom scene, and the scene where the parents came to realise they have lost their daughter.The bathroom scene literally sent a shiver through my spine, and I found myself wanting to hate a character, not something I do very often. Something about the villain in the movie just screamed evil, something that seems to be lacking in many, if not all movies. For that, I applaud the director and actors for their portrayal.The scene with Susie's parents weeping uncontrollably on the bed felt believably honest, another trait that is a rare find in movies. Once again, the movie sucked me in and made me feel what the characters felt, which is something that I haven't felt with a movie for a very long time.I'm not a parent, so I cannot imagine what it must feel like to lose your child, but I was a child, so I can attest to what it feels like to lose a parental type figure.All in all, this movie reeks of raw emotion and everyone who played a part in the creation of this movie should be applauded. This movie is a rare find, and those who cannot appreciate its heart may need to re-assess their humanity.",The Lovely Bones
585,jenny_mc,Worth the wait,8,25 February 2010,"I saw The Lovely Bones last night (it's finally come out in the UK). I've been following this film for over a year waiting for it to come out, and I read the book a few years ago. Peter Jackson is one of my favourite directors, and I have a huge amount of respect for him as a book adaptor. He, Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens were on top form!First off, the screenplay. I find this to be the most important aspect of a book adaptation. If the screenplay is off, it doesn't matter what the director does, it's just not going to be right. I also understand that books cannot be adapted straight into a screenplay. There's got to be some give and take. The screenwriter has to be very critical about what will actually transfer to film, and I believe they did a wonderful job. The script was dead on, the story flowed well, and I'm very proud of them.The way the book is written, it's not all that easy to adapt for film. It's written from the perspective of a girl who's died and is living in her own heaven. She remembers things in the middle of the book that help other things to make sense that've already come. That doesn't work for a film very well, so the beginning of the film was a lot different from the beginning of the book. Something I really liked about the book was how it addressed the rape and murder in the first chapter and didn't really look back. The book isn't at all about that event, it's about everything that happened afterwards, and I think that's what a lot of people appreciated about the book. It's different, it's original.Anyway, the other brilliant thing about this film is the visuals. Stunning! The ""heaven"" shots were done in New Zealand. I've had the privilege of visiting New Zealand and travelling the North Island, and seeing what Peter Jackson made of the scenery was inspiring. It really brought me back, especially the beach shots he used. The colours were captivating, and all-in-all this was just a visually stunning film.On that note, this is a very different film from Peter Jackson's normal stuff, I think. It was, in my opinion, his most artistic film to date. Watching the film, I wouldn't have immediately associated it with Peter Jackson, but he still managed to leave his production mark, as it were.The score...beautiful. One of the most important aspects of a film for me is the score. If the score isn't well done, something is just inherently lacking from the film. Brian Eno did some very interesting things within the film, calling on some of his older pieces and adapting it for The Lovely Bones. Some pieces are what would normally be associated with the word ""score"", and others were very different and original. I'm having trouble kind of describing what I mean, but basically there are some songs used in more serious scenes that sound like a ""typical"" score would (not in a bad way, just in a descriptive way). Then there are other songs that use guitars and drums and more set the scene, bringing the audience to the 70's, to the world of this 14 year old girl who's just starting to find out who she is and grow up. Just wonderful work from Brian Eno.Last but not least, acting. Wow. I've been a fan of Saoirse Ronan's since Atonement a few years ago. We're going to be seeing a lot of good things from this girl. Her narrations were very separate from her scenes. It worked well. You hear her telling the story, but then you also see her living it. Saoirse was able to capture the character very well. She was only 13 when she filmed it, but there's a lot of maturity going on there. It reminds me a lot of Kristen Stewart in Speak, which she filmed at about the same age. Both films have a heavy subject matter for actresses who are so very young, but they manage to hold their own in both instances. I still stand that Saoirse Ronan should have been given the awards season nod. Her work in The Lovely Bones deserves it. Rachel Weisz is beautiful in her role, really encapsulating the grieving mother who needs desperately to move on. Mark Wahlberg plays Jack brilliantly. The obsession and love really come to life on screen, and you can sympathise with him. You want him to find peace. Stanley Tucci is terrifying in a simplistic way. From his voice to the mannerisms he brings to Mr. Harvey, he really takes the character to another level from the book. The award nominations are deserved. I would absolutely recommend this film. Having read the book and seen the trailer, I had this idea in my head of how the film would be. I was very surprised in the cinema when it wasn't at all what I thought it would be. But not in a bad way, it was just as beautiful as I thought would be. I think Peter really took some risks and broadened his work in The Lovely Bones. I'm looking forward to seeing more from him and how he grows from here.",The Lovely Bones
586,sirdancelot-1,Someone please shorten this movie by at least 10 min of CGI,6,10 March 2012,"OK. This movie had everything going for it. Who doesn't love a ghost film? Starts off fantastically making you totally absorbed into a movie that will venture into the fantastic. Then the CGI starts. The subplot about the ""in between world"" should have been deleted in the editing room and at least one of those scenes should have been thrown out but oh, they were so expensive to make!!! What makes this movie suffer in the latter half is not lack of skills and creativity but having a too big budget. (almost every shot is a crane shot) And maybe having someone over your shoulder producing the movie, that used to make movies like ET and The color purple. You can almost sense Peter Jackson losing it in excess and focus as the film goes along. But the first half or one hour are spot on. Definitely worth a view, but you just watch all that great work going down the drain in the second half : ( At certain times in the film one should just close the eyes and listen to the excellent score by Brian Eno : )",The Lovely Bones
587,elkemadler,One of the BEST movies ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!,10,27 October 2012,"Anybody that reviewed this movie negative or rated it lower then 7 clearly has no imagination, emotions or fantasy... This movie is sad, funny, scary... All rolled up into one amazing touching story and the cast is superb... I mean what else to expect from Stanley Toochie, he is BRILLIANT... People need to stop taking everything so literal, the director clearly was trying to put a fantasy in-between world of a dead girl on film, like so many of us wish it might be once we pass over to the other side... So the fantasy world of that bright, colorful and peaceful world combined w the dark and scary mind of Stanley Toochie was absolutely brilliant!!!I could watch this movie over and over, and being a mother of a young girl I am especially moved by it... Imagining the strong bond the father had with the girl...Anyhow, I love love love it and can only recommend this movie to everybody with a big imagination and an open mind!!!",The Lovely Bones
588,unknown_thespain,A pathetic excuse for a movie,1,28 July 2011,"I started reading some IMDb reviews mid way through the movie and I can't believe how much they resonated with me. This is definitely one of the WORST movies I have ever seen. 6.6 for this?? I was tearing my hair off 20 mins into the movie!! I hated the movie so much that I am up well past midnight just to write this review and save a few souls from utter mental and intellectual mayhem. Better still, I created an IMDb profile so that I could rate this movie! I would rather watch paint dry than watch this sodomy of one of the most beautiful art forms. The movie could give ""Waterboarding"" a run for the money as a form of torture.If this movie is 6.6/10, ""Cannibal Holocaust"" is a perfect 10. I refuse to accept that this movie was made by the same guy who made the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy. It seldom happens that I heap bitter invective on something without giving a proper reason. But this movie was such an excruciating experience as a whole that I can't put my finger on its shortcomings. I am a very avid movie watcher and can boast of having watched ~220 of the top 250 listed on this website apart from hundreds of other titles in multiple languages. I have not read the novel and have no idea how good/ bad it is, but the movie simply blows!! I mean I am so disgusted that this is probably the worst prose I have ever written, and generally I am a pretty good writer. The movie just ruined my otherwise perfect day. PLEASE DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE!!",The Lovely Bones
589,user-37636,Give this movie a chance.,8,14 March 2010,"I just came home from the theater. I haven't read the book yet, nor i'm very aware of Peter Jackson's movies (except for District 9-WOW-, King Kong, The Lord of the Rings). This being, I was, say, 'neutral', when I decided this would be the next movie I'd pay to watch. And honestly, I was surprised to browse it on IMDb afterward and find it drowning in negative comments.Phew! OK, here's a bit of fresh air. For me, this movie was AMAZING. Let's move away from the plot though, since I don't know how original or close to the novel it is.Firstly, the acting was superb. Congrats to Saoirse Ronan for another applauding acting. Not to mention the remaining actors, from whom I have no negativity to point out.Stanley Tucci was perfectly characterized. I didn't even recognize him. He was a great stereotype of the quiet, lonely, mysterious person, but with a disturbed mind, psycho instincts, serial killer. I knew, right away, that she couldn't have been his only victim.Then, the purgatory scenes were sure dreamy. What's wrong with the CGI? It created this whole magic, pleasant and peaceful world. ""Her perfect world"", with an amazing photography. I just had to open my mind up for the fantasy. I also liked those connections she had with the real world. They were abstract, sometimes haunting.There were also some breath taking moments. Especially when I knew it would be her time. So tense, so slow... And when her sister sneaked into the Mr. Harvey's house, there was another highly tense moment after he entered home.After some of most tough moments of the story, they would be relieved with a bit of comedy. And it just fit so well. After all, this ain't a tragic story. Actually, the main character, Susie, was a girl with a natural positive personality which was transmitted throughout the movie.It was drama, suspense, fantasy, thriller and comedy. They may not seem to fit well together, but they did here and for me, it was a great achievement. So, if you are also 'neutral' (OK, let's call it 'ignorant') towards the movie (haven't read the book, don't know the director well, don't know what the budget was, don't know what to expect), you sure should watch it. Seriously, give it a chance. And then, go ahead and read the novel. If the movie was this great, I imagine how the novel can be.",The Lovely Bones

I'll get this on DVD. and thanks pete for adding cocteau twins in the film.

591,deanpulpas,Has Peter Jackson lost touch with reality?,3,12 January 2010,"I was terribly disappointed with this film. I am a huge fan of Heavenly Creatures, I went to see it in the cinema three times and every time it transported me to a different world, it shocked me and amazed me. Its secret was Peter Jackson's unique blend of fantasy and tragedy, the way he mixed amazing visuals with realistic drama. The Lovely Bones tries to do the same thing. I venture to say that Jackson was confident on his abilities to adapt Alice Sebold's novel because of his great artistic achievement in Heavenly Creatures. The truth is, 15 years later, Peter Jackson is a different director, and probably a different person. The intensity is not there anymore. I read somewhere that Jackson said that he wanted to make a film that his daughter could watch. A film about rape and murder that your daughter can watch? Maybe that's why he left out all the sordid details of the murder. Or why instead of concentrating on the drama of the family's loss he overloaded the film with cheesy CGI. Worst of all, not only he left out the gruesome parts and the hardcore drama; vital bits of information are only shown tangentially: the deterioration of the relationship between the parents is never really dealt with, for example. I mean, you have Rachel Weisz, half your job is already done!! I'm afraid Jackson chose to spend more time thinking how to create a visual treat out of a murder story than elaborating the characters. Having said this, I don't have a problem with Jackson's idea, but with the execution: the supernatural elements are too overwhelming. In a way, Jackson should be praised for being a romantic and thinking his fantasy world can interact with a family drama, that special effects can enhance human emotions. But this ideal just doesn't work in The Lovely Bones.",The Lovely Bones

Tastefully done but intensely creepy and chilling in parts whilst being almost fairytale-like in others.A compelling storyline throughout with a fine selection of subplots added to the mix which all tie up very well in the end.Excellent performances, as you'd expect, from Susan Sarandon Rachel Weiss and Mark Wahlberg but the performance of Saoirse Ronan (Atonement,Death Defying Acts) as Susie Salmon is the finest yet from this upcoming young actress.The film is dominated by the younger members of the cast who all give worthy performances despite having such well known adults above them in the billing.The film is a joy to watch with beautiful locations adding to its 'otherworldly' feel.Highly recommended heart-wrencher, a great start to 2010's long list of movie releases.",The Lovely Bones
594,count_alucard-1,a huge disappointment,5,18 July 2010,"i first read the lovely bones by Alice Sebold on holiday many years ago and fell in love instantly. on fist hearing that it was to be made into a film i was excited, however when i realised that Peter Jackson was in charge of this project i had a feeling that what i was so looking forward to may severely disappoint....and i was correct.Jackson has taken the concept of a missing child and the grief that goes with it and turned it into a CGI fest. i felt the lack of emotion in this picture let it down. despite all the random and unnecessary CGI this film was lacking creativity and emotion. by avoiding the actual issue of the book, which is the rape, murder, loss of a child and the concept of heaven and death Jackson has insulted the viewers, the fans of the book and Sebold herself.the only reason i give this film a score of 4 is due to my love of the book and Jacksons previous work. i only hope that in the years to come someone else will see the potential in this tragically beautiful tale and make it into a decent film that will push this emotionless article back into the annals of bad movies.",The Lovely Bones
595,filmgeek18,The film and the book are two COMPLETELY different things...,8,16 January 2010,"First off, Alice Sebold's ""The Lovely Bones"" is most definitely one of my favorite books of all time, and many of you may not agree with me considering that it closes almost like a Cormac McCarthy novel. Most critics have been bashing the movie simply because of how different it actually is from the book. Believe me when I tell you, the book and the movie are two COMPLETELY different things. Many key characters and events are left out, as well as the order in which they were introduced. The blunt truth: I liked the movie, but there were just too many flaws that couldn't be overlooked. Despite its shocking MPAA rating, many people were very upset that the rape scene would possibly be removed. Honestly, I could care less. On my list of complaints, that one would be dead last (if I even decide to put it on there). The first half-hour was exactly as I had expected, perfectly paced and tastefully executed all up to Susie's capture (one of the best scenes played by the two best actors). After that, things start to get a little too weird jumping almost immediately from a sequence of grisly images, to excerpts from a 70's disco music video. Really?? There is such a thing as visual overkill, and yes, this film's got it. Forty minutes wasted on CGI that adds nothing to the compelling story. What was left over should have gone to Rachel Weisz, whose prominent character was sliced and diced to the point of forgetting she was actually in the film (her affair is not even referenced). Five-year-old Buckley had more depth and screen time than she did! Although I was disappointed back in '07 when Ryan Gosling decided to scrap the role of Jack, Mark Whalberg worked well with what he was given. Susan Sarandon was crammed into the mix, which made her character just plain annoying throughout the course of the running time. The Salmon Family back-story is rushed, one-dimensional and overlooked; a perfect example of the book and the movie being incomparable. It just doesn't fit.I'm very surprised at the paint-by-numbers approach that Jackson decided to take with this movie. He tried to get us excited for it with the summer release of ""District 9"", which really got some heads turning. Why this movie sat in post-production for two years is beyond me, and the fact that the film's runtime was reduced to 135 minutes might have something to do with its PG-13 rating. Although Jackson states, ""I had never intended to get into R-rated territory of any kind."" I can't even begin to tell you how contradicting and hypocritical that statement sounds. It doesn't have anything to do with the heavy depictions of sexuality and violence in Sebold's novel (in which this movie was supposedly based on). It has everything to do with Sir Peter himself. Remember the sadistically revolting ""Dead Alive""? How about the wickedly bizarre ""Meet the Feebles""? Yes, the one with the puppets. Yes, before ""Crank Yankers"" and ""Team America: World Police"". You would really have to see all of his films to understand. It's no wonder why so many critics were disappointed and somewhat disillusioned with what they saw. No matter what anyone says, I really wanted to love this movie. But now it's time to talk about what I was really happy with.Number one: Saoirse Ronan and Stanley Tucci; without a doubt, the best acting you will ever see in 2009. Even more than the delightful Anna Kendrick in ""Up In The Air"" and Sandra Bullock in ""The Blind Side"", Saoirse is remarkable in the most outstanding performance by a female child actor in decades (that's really saying a lot). Stanley Tucci is clearly unrecognizable and an absolute knockout as the disturbing pedophile in a performance that no one could replace. Wow! Is this really the same guy from ""Beethoven"" and ""The Devil Wears Prada""? Unreal. Watching these two perform is simply mesmerizing. Prepare to be shaken. Number two: The ingenious cinematography by the remarkable Andy Lesnie. Beautifully crafted shots of the Delaware Valley transforms magically onto the big screen. It's unbelievable and extremely hard to understand that this film was shot on the RED in segments. At first, I thought it was just a rumor. HOW the hell did he get the movie to look like that? Does this explain the two-year delay? I must know! Overall, despite the obvious flaws as previously mentioned, the movie was well-done. Excellent production design keeps you in the era of the early 70's without a flinch. Jackson keeps the suspense a-tingling with his usual blend of a dark and creepy atmosphere. If you compare this movie to the book, you'll hate it, I can almost guarantee. So please try to enter the theater with a clear mind. Those of you, who haven't read the book, do yourself a favor and watch the movie first. It may not be perfect, but it's worth the viewing.",The Lovely Bones
596,simonclong-591-556276,A very disappointing adaptation.,4,30 November 2009,"I'll start by saying I've read the book twice (just because I'm a PJ fan so wanted to know what he would be working on) and loved it. No, it's not brilliantly written and does veer off in places but I found it genuinely moving. So went to the film (London) with high hopes, loving both source material and director. Major disappointment.MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD My main criticism is the family characters have all been severely short-changed (which is no fault of the cast who are all superb with what little they've been given). The Grandma (Susan Sarandon) is simply there for inappropriate comic effect; you get no sense whatsoever she helped pull the family back together. There's a montage of her screwing up the housework with a drink in her hand and cigarette dangling from her mouth but her character in the source material really drives the family along. Not here. In this version the Grandma is there to do the hoovering. I really feel for Sarandon.Rachel Weisz fares even worse. She has absolutely nothing to work with as the mother and neither do the actors who play the Detective (Michael Imperioli) and Ray & Ruth who have hardly any characterisation (or screen time). From cast interviews on the red carpet it's clear dramatic family scenes were filmed but cut (here comes the 3 hr DVD edition) including the Mother's affair. Both Sarandon and Imperioli are both calling PJ out on it... watch that get more press as time goes on. PJ is simply too obsessed with the 'In-Between World' and it seems he sees the story as a thriller, following the murderer way too much. While it's fun to watch Stanley Tucci who's terrific, the down-side is you hardly care about the family towards the end. Mark Wahlberg is good (yes, really) but his role should be so much more powerful. It's a big mistake; those that have read the book know there's no emotional pay-off on the murder, it's all attached to the emotion of the family rebuilding itself. It's the film's fundamental flaw; it should be terribly moving but it's empty. The mother returns and they hug. That's it. Brilliant.Visually, it's stunning and I do feel like I need to watch it again for the little visual clues in the 'In-Between World' here and there that Susie needs to spot in order to move on. There are also some great stand-out scenes where PJ shows off his technical skills (how Susie discovers she's been murdered is especially well done as is the tension when her sister is in the murderer's house). Saoirse is brilliant but the script just doesn't give her the powerful role she deserves - she's a better actress than the material PJ gives her.To anyone who says the reduction in the role of the family is simply cutting away the worst of the book, they're wrong; it just doesn't work as a film either. It's a story about the family; that's what 'the lovely bones' are, the new bonds that form following Susie's death - it's even explained in the book (patronising as it it in places). And so it's the lovely bones themselves that are lacking in the film (including the relationship her sister develops which is one of the most moving story-lines of the book). I think people who see the film who aren't familiar with the book will be even more frustrated; they won't care about the family and will have no resolution on the murder.Can't tell you how disappointed I am with PJ. How a man that made Heavenly Creatures allowed this cut of the film through I have no idea. His budgets are clearly going to his head; it's all style and absolutely no substance (and believe me I was desperately willing myself to love the film as I was watching).Last thought; maybe the well publicised test-screenings resulted in the drama being cut? Either way it's fatal to this film (and any Oscar hopes).",The Lovely Bones

Most of the complaints I'm reading online comment about the lack of resolution in the film, which is not Jackson's fault, as he's being true to The Lovely Bones book. Just finished reading Forgiving Ararat - the themes are remarkably similar, with it starting with a dead woman in her own version of heaven - but there they digress completely and the book's themes are basically justice and resolution, both of which you get in spades in a really remarkable work! Google Forgiving Ararat and you can read 2 chapters for free. As both a fan and publicist, I much prefer seeing the murderer brought to justice at the end! In Lovely Bones, things are left much more open, and we have to be content with Susie's blissful version of heaven as her murderer goes free.

And it's usually a male reviewer. Was he looking forward to watching the 14-year-old girl get murdered on screen and we didn't give him satisfaction?""""This film demanded a very different type of film-making, so we deliberately decided to walk away from those big-budget fantasy types of films and tackle something very different.

Mr. Jackson succeeds in the task of blending the film's divergent elements.The Lovely Bones is more than just a powerful thriller.

Lovely Bones is a mess of a film. Lets start with casting - the 14 year old's love interest actually looks about 25. The kissing scenes with him are even more creepy than those involving the pedo / murderer. Mark Wahlberg is his usual ""cardboard cut-out"" self. The plot is simply ludicrous - some examples: Why do the parents wait for 4 hours for the girl to come home and then the first thing Walberg does is head out into the streets of town flashing a photo of his daughter to complete strangers (wouldn't you ring the school, ring her friends, ring the police???) Why does Wahlberg compile files on hundreds of potential suspects but totally disregards the loner weirdo living right across the street. Why do we have the wacky scene in the middle involving the arriving Grandmother (does not in anyway match the mood of the rest of the film). As a piece of art - it is also atrocious - we see the same scenes over and over again (I felt like I had been bludgeoned by the Pedo). And what was the point of the plot anyway - the Pedo does not get caught, seemingly lives a long and happy pedo life and then falls off a cliff. Are we meant to be convinced that just because he dies a tragic death at about age 80 that somehow he got what he deserved. He was probably going to die of old age the following day in any event. Are we also meant to believe that the girls family is now going to live a happy and fulfilled life. This seems unlikely when the police have again bungled capture of the killer and for all they know he is coming back for the younger daughter. Combine this with the fact that the murdered girl is left to live an eternity in heaven with 6 murdered strangers - what type of heaven is that? The special effects look cheap, the music score is overdone. I have never understood what voyeuristic pleasure people get out of watching films about serial killers and what they do to innocent people. The book at least tried to tackle this issue from an uplifting perspective but this Hollywood piece of trash is just another morbid account of a serial killer dressed up as a piece of failed art. Ryan Gosling dumped this movie shortly into production - not even he could have saved this absolute Turkey1 out of 10 from me",The Lovely Bones
602,superstitiouskitty-627-579660,It could have been much worse...,6,5 January 2010,"I know that a lot of people have said that the CGI was the killer here (as well as poor performances) and I agree up to a certain point. There was a lot of overkill when it came to the 'afterlife' scenes. I think Jackson should have focused more on the emotional rather than the 'spellbinding' that I think he was aiming for.For me, the acting wasn't THAT bad. I think that Stanley Tucci and Saoirse Ronan were quite good in terms of how they portrayed their characters. I didn't like how certain events were cut from the film. Susie's mother and Len Fenerman's affair, for example. Also, Susie's narrative could have been nipped and tucked a bit. It did get a tad tedious at times, especially when it was unnecessary.All in all, it was a good film to sit down and watch (with my best friend) on a girls' day out. It was emotional and nice to view, but not a life-changing experience. The book was much better, but in terms of a movie adaptation I didn't think that it was so terrible. It could have been much worse.",The Lovely Bones
603,cozzolino_michelle,Review of Peter Jackson's The Lovely Bones,5,7 January 2010,"Because I am Kiwi I dearly wanted to love this movie, but I just couldn't. From start to finish I found it disappointing. The only scene which held any credence for me was when Susie Q was introducing the other murdered candidates, which was nicely and reverently done. A serious flaw in this movie is the lack of relationship between characters. I was left sorely wanting, I needed to know so much more about these characters, I needed to feel their pain, so most importantly I could in turn understand their actions. I recall one of Susie Q's final lines about how her lovely bones made up the ties of her world and her family, but I didn't believe it because Peter had in no way made me feel any attachment to any of the characters. I did not believe their grief, nor understand how they came to the conclusion the neighbor had done it. Maybe Peter believed that everybody had read the book, which I have, but I attended with two non readers who found it very hard to follow the plot. And placing little cameos like Susan Sarandans seemingly comical attention to household chores was anything but funny and seemed entirely incoherent in this movie. Symbolic material can be good and relevant and offer meaning however the overuse of contextual imagery and props in the lovely bones was just too much. And the music reminds me of Sergei's Peter and the Wolf, a different tempo for each character and for each event; A Lovely Bones composition? I think Peter and Fran have delved too much into the recreation of seventies film processes and the visual effects for the world in between, and they fail to recognize that it is the story that has to be the success because their version of the story is disjointed and reasonless and uninspiring. A sad affair, I had expected so much more.",The Lovely Bones
604,martyfrizzell,Definitely Worthwhile,8,7 January 2010,"Wow, a lot of harsh responses to this movie. I read the reviews before watching it and saw they were quite partisan, so i honestly didn't know what to expect.... I really liked it. Of course all the reviews are ONLY subjective opinions. I noted that a lot of the negative stuff focused on casting and directors' and a few other technical things. I really don't care for names of directors's or actors I just want a response from my own psyche and this did it . I felt for the family, it was a sad story. I see Walburg got hammered for his performance. To me, Life does not pick its ideal actor for tragic situations, it happens indiscriminately and i had no issue with him in this role.. Also I liked that it was set in the 70's, wow what a different time!I say judge it for yourself. It is a worthwhile watch for sure whether you like it or not.",The Lovely Bones
605,melynda78,the lovely boring bones,1,8 January 2010,"This had to be one of the worst and most boring movies I have ever seen. I had to register at this site just so I could warn people not to waste their money. This movie is nothing like the previews, that are very misleading. The ending was very disappointing. For a two hour film it seemed like 5 hours of complete nonsense. I felt like shutting it off after 20 minutes but wanted to see the conclusion. Which was terrible, unrealistic and kept going on and on. Did they have four different endings that they decided to just throw in all together in the end. Who ever made this movie should be working at a fast food restaurant not in Hollywood. The special effects were terrible. I had no idea what was going on. They kept jumping around to different scenes that made no sense. I found myself constantly saying, oh my god are you kidding me.What that is so stupid. What is going on now. Does this movie ever end.Why is the dead girl still in the movie. What the heck is she doing.What just happened, that was so stupid. people grew up but time neverseemed to go by. This movie was based from a book that I hope wasbetter than this movie because I'm sure it just ended Marky Marks career as an actor.",The Lovely Bones
606,evatje_12,Brilliant and endearing!,8,9 January 2010,"I don't quite understand why everyone thinks this movie is such a flop. Peter Jackson is a visionary director and he portrayed the 'Inbetween' very well. He is brilliant, just look at Lord of the Rings! Also, this movie is about a girl who is murdered and can watch her family and the killer from above and see how they cope with her absence. She wants her murderer to be punished for what he did and prevent others from becoming his next victim, yet by doing so her family cannot move on... This was a crucial factor in the book and I think Jackson managed to show this factor in the movie, although he could have tried harder. The effects are overwhelming as it was in the book, so that's a big plus. They were necessary for the viewer to feel her pain and her fear, but also her joy for the world she is now 'living' in.I have the feeling that a movie can never be quite as good as the book, even so Peter Jackson managed to focus on the important parts and succeeded in portraying the loss of a child, the grief, Susie's abrupt ending and all the things she still wanted to do. Just read the book and if you like it, watch the movie, and you will see what a great story this really is.Therefore, I award it with an 8/10.",The Lovely Bones
607,psiho333,Viewers left in between two words,5,27 March 2010,"This film is a perfect example about the deluding trailers. ""My father has all the pieces, just can't put them together"" is a quote from the trailer that does not even exist in the film. And what it makes you believe (with a few other quotes from the trailer) that this will be a mystery / detective story where Susan's father tries to solve the murder and she constantly tries to intervene, trying to give hints as to who the murder is.Well, I and probably a whole bunch of other people, were wrong. There is close to no interaction at all. The story starts great, but then just falls short. There is no plot development, and you keep saying in your mind, ""Come on, do something Susie! Try to interact with people!"" and it stays at that.The premise was good, but in the end the story seemed only half made --- and thus a merely 5 as a vote (half of the maximum). Perhaps it's a bit unfair, since the film really is beautiful with gorgeous panoramas and shots -- after all it is Peter Jackson. But still it made me and my girlfriend leave the theater disappointed and a bit angry. Something was missing.",The Lovely Bones
608,vuzak,"Beautiful, fantastic, hauntingly awesome",10,10 January 2010,"Thank you, thank you, thank you everybody involved in making this film. I found it profound, haunting, beautiful, awesome, creepy, heart-wrenching, tragic, magic, lovely, in so many ways.If you didn't like this film, you have no soul. If you didn't ""get it"", you have no mind or intellect for what good stories are all about. Go back to Titanic :)The actors are just right for the parts, hardly any stereotyping or clichéd presentations to find, and the protagonist is just simply fantastic. She embodies what her role is. She IS the role. Her little sister comes into her own too. One of the best things about it is that all the ""magical"" sequences never turned all contrite, clammy and new-agey as they so easily could. Very well done, well scripted. Shudder to think what Spielberg could have made of this. It woulda turned out to a big rainbow festival of hand-holding, but instead it's a beautiful, brittle, crisp and haunting little film that will stay with you forever.

609,amz1315-633-982960,The Lovely Bones,10,30 January 2010,"This movie was a breath of fresh air. The script was written unlike other predictable scripts where you know the ending and what is going to happen next, differently in that it didn't put down the murderer or focus on the cops going after the villain, oh no. It focused on what happens to us after death. This was its strength. I can tell the religious folk's reviewing style as it doesn't sit well with their philosophies. The universe took care of business and dealt the final blow to the murderer. As horrific as it seems, bad shift happens and to heal we all should move forward in our lives. We all die. Someday. This movie took a stance that a lot of people know intrinsically in their hearts to be right and proper. There is never scientific evidence for this scenario playing out but science has hit a brick wall that only the esoteric can further its understandings of life. The whole movie was played out delicately, the acting superb, the thriller aspect was awesome and for those people that don't want to be spoon fed all their lives, watch this movie. I was surprised by all the parts and the CGI. One couldn't help getting angry at how the script and storyline panned out but when you got to the end you could see what the director Peter Jackson was trying to portray. One can't ever compare books to films as it will never make people who've read the book first happy. All in all, a wonderful experience and a ten out of ten for this breath of fresh air. I don't know what the other reviewer was on about as I have a degree in film and TV and all the aspects were put together excellently.",The Lovely Bones
610,will-lane,Traded Plot For Effects,4,14 January 2010,"Till now I've never let comparing a movie to the book it was based on ruin my experience watching the movie for me, I believe directors should have the freedom to tell a story the way they see fit. But there is a difference between retelling and hacking a story apart to make it pg-13 and to show off poorly done CG that adds nothing to the movie. There was very little character development, especially with the mother, little explanation for characters actions, and the protagonist's family appeared to be too happy to be living with the recent murder of their daughter in their own neighborhood. The Lovely Bones wasn't near as dark or grisly as a movie about a little girl's brutal murder should be. The transitions between suspense and lighter scenes seemed forced and unnatural, and the entire movie felt rushed.That being said, the actors fit their roles well, their acting was excellent, and the 70's setting of The Lovely Bones seemed authentic.",The Lovely Bones
611,HughJanus1,Man what a waste of my time!,1,17 January 2010,"This movie was horrible! There are so many things to say about it I almost don't know where to begin. First off let me just say that it was a very good book. I do like Peter Jackson and I thought the talent in the movie had the skills to be good. The problem, though is that Peter Jackson apparently not only lost a bunch of weight, but some of his brain must have leaked out too. He did a very, very poor job on this one. It was a story about young girls being raped and murdered yet he wanted us to feel happy about it? The only good scene was went the sister was snooping around the house and then the brief chase, but even then he screwed up! Here's this teenage girl running from a man who she knows for a fact now killed her sister and she just broke into his house and now when she gets home completely out of breath, she sees her mom and just says, ""Nah I will just forget about this dude who might still be after me and I will stay quiet."" It seems like forever b4 she eventually gives the book over to Susan Surandon and then the scene ends without us seeing her reaction. It was real bad. Speaking of Susan, I love her, but she was like a damn character out of some comedy with Seth Rogan or something. It was totally misplaced. Also the trailer for this film made it seem like the girl would help catch her killer and that is just not how things were. Then to top it off the bad guy dies in what is one of the absolute lamest deaths I have ever seen. Not good. DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE!!",The Lovely Bones
612,azarariddle,Best Movie I Have Seen In Years,10,15 January 2010,"Yes, I get it, the effects are cheesy and the movie long, but all those are for a reason. It will not live up to the book, nothing ever does. Her heaven is not perfectly crafted, she's 14 and her imagination is portrayed in her heaven. That is why this was done. And while most seem to hate the length, I enjoyed Jackson took the time to include the most key things into the movie. Overall, I thought it gave a beautiful message and it is truly incredible. The actors were perfectly cast, the script as true to the book as a movie can be and Peter Jackson always impresses. Though some did not take it seriously the night I saw it, I thought it was touching.",The Lovely Bones
613,machadoblue,It's not that bad,8,15 January 2010,"Everyone seems to have jumped all over this movie and just about killed it. It is actually not a bad movie. As with every book to movie conversion, never think its all gonna be there, coz it ain't. If you want the pure unedited full version, read the book. You can not possibly add in every event into every movie. Or we would be watching longer and longer movies.Anyway.... my take on this movie was great. A murder with a difference, its the story told through the eyes of the dead girl. It is what she observes to be happening. Yes, there were a couple of roles that could have been developed alittle more, such as the psychic girl who can see Susie. There is like only 2 or 3 bits.The father, tries to hold it together for his family. Susies mother, devastated yes, and chooses to leave because she really cant handle it and her husband, and her mother and the kids. The grandmother is a comic relief for the movie. The father played by mark walberg, is trying to hold it together for most of the movie and then breaks down at the end.I thought the acting was well done. I thought the girl that played Susie was perfect for the role. I was actually drawn into the movie and held there for a while despite the movie being 2:20 mins long. It really didn't feel long at all.Basically, if you have read the book and have different expectations then you might find the movie less enjoyable. I haven't read the book and only read the wiki cliff notes after I saw the movie to fill in a couple of holes. The movie doesn't show she was raped like the book.The music was great and the CG scenes, show the life of a dead girl stuck in a limbo. She was watching her family, friends and her murder, however, every so often, she would be drawn by afterlife pushing her towards heaven. Every time she got to the peak, she couldn't go because something kept her from crossing over. People said the limbo scenes were boring. If you had half of any kind of imagination, you would get it. This movie is about Susie. In life and in death. Not about the grieving family or her murderer.Toss the book aside, go out and see the movie and keep an open mind and imagination. You will see what the movie is really about.",The Lovely Bones

Although I can see how someone would think it was boring if you don't have the book to reference back too. Acting was good, especially Grandma Lynn and Mr. Harvey. Perfectly played. They had to cut out a lot from the movie for times sake which was a bit disappointing here and there, but gave a few changes that were interesting. I was happy to see the ending was a bit better than the book, as I felt the ending in the book did not give Mr Harvey enough punishment. All in all read the book then see the movie, just don't expect to be wowed.",The Lovely Bones

I was planning on reading the book but with such a shitty ending. I don't think i'll bother. I mean come on the guy gets away with multiple murders and then by some supernatural act an icicle falls on his shoulders and he trips and falls over a cliff and die .... this is laughable. have these directors ever heard of verisimilitude?

And I began to see things in a way that let me hold the world without me in it. The events that my death wrought were merely the bones of a body that would become whole at some unpredictable time in the future. The price of what I came to see as this miraculous body had been my life.""-Pg. 320 in ""The Lovely Bones"" by Alice Sebold~*~Someone here said something, that I finally connected with. And I feel I need to share that, with this ongoing debate that's been raging back and forth, between those who loved the film, and those who were disappointed in it. I myself am slowing making my ""peace"" with this movie that Peter Jackson made, I feel I need to add this as part of that process, especially since, directors make unsatisfying movies out of great books, all the time. This isn't a first, and it won't be the last.Please keep in mind that my feelings about this film, and my disappointment in it, are *mine* to own. They don't have to be yours. I was and am still very invested in the book. It was given to me to read sometime after my Mom died very suddenly and it helped me, make peace with her death, and a series of sudden deaths that came as the years went on. For me, it has come down to this: I've had to re-watch the film with a much more open mind, in order to find the good in it. The precious moments... the saving grace(s). And I will admit there were some of those in the film. Some. And within those, I found some peace. There were one or two times I said ""That's it, he got it right"". Add to that, that the music was amazing, especially that song by 'This Mortal Coil'. Haunting, and perfect for the scene it was used in. In fact, I do believe that was the single most perfect scene in the entire film. Bravo, Mr. Jackson.With all that being said, here is what I truly, truly struggle with when it comes to this movie (aside from how sad it made me to see such a intense, rich, death... yet life filled story, reduced. All those cuts, the incorrect time line, the character changes, the storyline changes, and everything else that grabbed me and shook me up after I saw it), my only REAL issue with it now, is that, the title of the book is ""The Lovely Bones"". The title of this movie was/is ""The Lovely Bones"", and so, the movie should, at the least, have reflected that title. That key phrase.If you didn't read the book, you won't understand. So let me explain: I'll start here -- this came from a user on here (IMDB.com):""Anyway! As for the Lovely Bones: I found it hollow and empty at the end of the movie, when Susie was explaining the whole ""these are all the lovely bones that were built after my death"" narration. I was kinda like, what?? What bones? In the book, there WERE more connections built between people, and events that changed things to make people become who they were, etc... as a result of her death. So it made more sense, that those were the 'lovely bones' of a structure that were created as a result of her absence. In the movie, though, it was like... what? Where are the ""lovely bones"" ???? The fact that...Ray and Ruth were sorta friends? What else in the movie was 'built' as a result of her death in the lives of those still living? Didn't really work.""The ""lovely bones"", were the people... the connections, life, moving on, up, into time. The structures of life... of living, of people, living and growing, coping, and moving on, despite a major loss. Despite... lack of closure. Lack of justice. Lack of answers.The ""lovely bones"" were... Lindsey and (I've forgotten his name, sorry), finding the house and getting married. The baby. The garden. Buckley growing up. Ray and Ruth's friendship. Mrs. Singh. Grandma Lynn passing away. Holiday passing away. Dad healing after a heart attack. Even George, dying the way he did, because as Holly said, ""Everybody dies"", and, that's what happened to him. REALITY.So... where were the lovely bones in the movie??Fleeting briefly amongst under-developed characters who we never really got to know. We never really got to see their pain, their suffering. We did not really get to see what Susie's death did to them. The movie didn't give the viewers the chance to really truly see inside grief, and life ""after death"". They were given something, but they were not given ""the lovely bones"".If I could have Peter fix just one thing, it would simply be to give the viewer MORE, in the way of ""the lovely bones"", to make ""The Lovely Bones"", the story it was, and always will be. Adapted or otherwise. That's it. Everything else, I can live with.The book's story is intense, and dark. It's about life, having loose ends, that don't always get tied up in a nice, neat, perfect bow. It's about, coping with those loose ends. Coping with things just not going the way you NEED them and LONG for them to. Sadness. Holes in our lives. It's about... crossing over, both in the afterlife, and in real life. And if you've ever lost someone you loved, you know exactly what I mean. And, you are ""the lovely bones"" of your personal story.",The Lovely Bones

618,cellos-and-sunshine,Disrespects the Plot of the Book,1,18 January 2010,"Peter Jackson did a HORRIBLE job with this movie. Just like all other book-to-movie adaptations, it was a TRAIN WRECK. There are several missing and/or out-of-order events that were crucial to the story, as well as some discrepancies from the book.1. In the book, the mother leaves AFTER the dad gets the living daylights beat out of him in the cornfield, NOT before.2. In the book, Ray and Ruth are Susie's same age, not older. 3. In the book, the mother and Detective Fenerman have an affair. THIS IS CRUCIAL to the rest of the story as it not only happens while Dad is in the hospital recovering from the cornfield incident, but it causes her to leave! 4. There is just way too much that happens in the book after the murder that is actually IMPORTANT to the story, and sadly left out.5. In the book, Mom returns only when Dad is in the hospital after suffering a heart attack, and the children are MUCH older. Also, she and Lindsey do not automatically make nice with each other, the same holding true for her and her husband. 6. Nothing is done to show the developing relationship between Dad and Buckley in the time that has passed since the murder as it is in the book. The poor little boy just kind of...disappears. In fact, nothing is really done to show the progression of time at all. 7. As with Buckley, the stories of Ruth and Ray just kind of...disappear. 8. Where is Mrs. Singh? She is a critical character as Mom befriends her at some point in the book! 9. In the book, Mr. Harvey dumps the safe with Susie's body into the sinkhole RIGHT after the murder, NOT at the end when he is preparing to run away. 10. In the book, when Susie comes back to Earth near the end, her soul possesses Ruth's body and Ruth's soul goes up to heaven, where she is considered a hero. Susie in her entirety does not fall back down to Earth. Ray kisses Ruth's lips but it is Susie's soul who occupies the body.11. In the book, Dad tells Lindsey to break into Mr. Harvey's house. She doesn't do it of her own accord.12. In the book, Dad doesn't root through lists of serial killers, etc., to suggest Detective Fenerman to look through. His initial instinct is Mr. Harvey. Also, in the book, Ray is thoroughly investigated by the police as a suspect.Peter Jackson seems to have, yet again, gone special-effects crazy and not too focused on a plot. Alice Sebold herself should have directed the movie, at least we would have seen some sort of visible plot.Also, my recommendation to anyone wanting to watch a movie adaptation of a book - just read the book. Don't waste your time on the movie.And my recommendation to directors who want to make a movie adaptation of a book - don't waste your time either. It seems that every movie adaptation of a book is brutally butchered, then left hanging in the Inbetween, just as Susie Salmon is in in The Lovely Bones.",The Lovely Bones

I mean i hated mostly the whole movie i mean she goes to some place that ain't even heaven then some Asian girl talks to her and it was just bad. I mean i don't understand she died then just watched her family or whatever and nothing happened. I think the best part was the end when the dude like fell off a cliff but that was it.

620,chrsbakr,Swing and a miss for Jackson,3,4 August 2010,"What this film lacks in substance, it tries to make up for with CGI. Unfortunately, the effects add nothing of value to the film and don't help to tell the story in any way. In addition, the pacing of this movie was terrible. The narration is contrived and extremely preachy without proving that it has earned the right to preach to its audience. The blend of violence with the innocent nature of the main character borders on absurdity and made me wonder who the audience was that Jackson had in mind for this picture.The acting is the only redeeming quality in the film, with great performances especially by Tucci and Ronan. Their performances, however, could not salvage the poorly written script. The movie essentially tries to weave two narratives together: a young girl stuck in purgatory and her family trying to cope with her death. The first narrative, however, simply distracts the viewer from what could have been a great tale of a young family trying to survive after a tragic accident. That narrative was actually very well done and evokes a lot of real emotion. The second narrative does little more than distract the audience from the real story and ruin the pacing of the film, making it seem as if it drags on for much longer than its 2:15 or so run-time.I like Peter Jackson, but he really struck out with this one. I have not read the book, but it seems like there was too much source material and too deep of a subject covered by it to be completely captured by the film.",The Lovely Bones
621,rrhaque,Wonderful experience!,8,1 February 2010,"I had gone through some negative reviews of this movie, and decided to write my own, as they were not really reflecting my views. I watched The Lovely Bones yesterday and found it really interesting and soothing for my mind. The movie is like a poetry. I haven't read the original novel, but the movie is based on a not-too-complicated storyline. It has enough elements to attract the audience up to the end and the acting (specially the negative role played by Stanley Tucci) was excellent.Recently there are some movies with great technology (eg. Avatar) or extremely violent scenes (eg. Inglourious Bastards), and people are buying the side attraction more than the main storyline. The Lovely Bones may not present itself as a technological marvel like Avatar, but it has a stronger theme and more artistic shade.Most importantly, I felt good after watching this movie. 8 stars.",The Lovely Bones

Great cast, great acting but overall a complete disaster with many parts bordering the ridiculous. It proves one point, the quality of a film hinges on the script. Reminded me a little of the 1998 Robin Williams movie ""What Dreams May Come"" which I also thought was really bad. I don't think that trying to depict the after life or ""in between"" is ever a good idea at least judging from these two movie experiences. There are things that we humans just won't be able to wrap our minds around this side of the curtain.",The Lovely Bones
623,jwbruce-658-54316,The Lovely Bones is a beautiful film :),9,10 February 2010,"This movie was Great. Peter Jackson has made another terrific movie. I loved it. I went to see it at the theater alone, and I found myself weeping hysterically one moment and gripped with fear the next. I've read other reviews that have talked about a ""lack of focus""in the film, but I felt like the story line was very well focused, and very close to original despite the obvious clichés that are next to impossible to avoid these days. I was sick with disgust through some of the movie and overwhelmed with joy during other parts. Few movies have pulled at my emotions live this one did. I recommend it to anyone who like a good suspenseful & emotional flick. Also, the visuals in the movie are absolutely stunning. If you are interested in seeing this movie, you should see it at the theater! It is freaking beautiful. Lots of the imagery reminded me of the more beautiful scenes in tideland. I don't know anything about the book, so I can't make a comparison there.",The Lovely Bones

I had no idea of the plot or story line of this movie and was pleasantly surprised by the whole concept of it. There are no car chase scenes no shoot outs and no scenes of blood and guts spilling out just a very very good story line well told and acted. As far as quality of performance from the actors 8 out of 10, plot 8 out of 10, direction 8 from 10. Jackson does well with a very difficult story to screen transformation. There appears to be an agenda by some to rubbish this movie why? I know not. Judge for yourselves and try not to take to much notice of wannabee critics.

I have read tonnes of bad reviews but tried not to let them influence my previous liking to the film, many of the reviews i read were talking about ""too much cgi"" spoiling the film.the cgi used was an amazing portrayal of an in between world you visit before entering heaven, mixed with the imagination of a 14 year old girl peter jackson delivers an onslaught of imagery true to the mind of Susie salmon.i thought the film was a very emotional piece and at points it had me gripped to my seat, the house break in was delivered well and suspenseful, and i also felt a degree of admiration towards the father on how persistent he was at trying to find his daughters killer. most the acting was done to a very acceptable degree, except for Susie's sister who i thought was quite standard and one dimensional.i highly recommend the film and was disappointed at the amount of reviews that just focused on how the cgi blanked out the depth of the actors performances.",The Lovely Bones
626,roseconradmarketing,Why are reviewers being so critical?,9,22 February 2010,"I'm chagrined at why reviewers are being so critical of a film of this caliber. Certainly this is a forum for opinions, and everyone's entitled to say whether or not they liked the film and why. My opinion is I liked The Lovely Bones and enjoyed it very much; someone else's opinion may be that they didn't like this movie and it wasn't a very good experience for them. Fine. We're all entitled to our OPINIONS.What I find so puzzling is the furious, overly-critical reviews of this movie! The people who have written, produced, directed and acted in The Lovely Bones are PROFESSIONALS. We, the audience, are AMATEURS. We can share our thoughts, I think we'd all enjoy hearing them, that's why we're on this forum, but for heaven's sakes in doing so we should also exercise some restraint and show some respect for the experienced professionals who are highly-paid for their work in this field.For we reviewers (who I would venture to say for the most part have never written, produced, directed and acted in a movie and wouldn't know the first thing about pulling together such a monumental artistic project) to attack a director's talent, vision and expertise TO THIS EXTENT seems uncalled for.Okay, we can say whether or not we liked it, we can comment on our favorite scenes and actors, rate it on how much we liked or disliked it on these and other similar elements, but I think we should think twice before over-criticizing a professional's work and vision and the technical aspects of a movie until we've put one up on the screen ourselves!

What was the point of this movie anyway? That a beautiful young girl on the verge of love and young adulthood is robbed of her life and her family is torn apart and we learn later, the murderer has torn many families apart? And the picture of Heaven is nothing worth dying for, nothing like the one I'm looking forward to someday, all in good time. I am angry that I was even sucked into watching this. My instinct was to leave after 15 minutes, but I kept hoping the movie would get better. Unfortunately not. And for the huge portion of our female population who have been terrified or abused by an older man, this movie is a horror movie of the worst kind. I've never done a movie review before, but if this keeps even one person from filling their mind with images that are filed away somewhere inside forever, it's worth writing. Shame on all those who had anything to do with this obscene creation.",The Lovely Bones

I can agree that there is a lot of CGI going on but it doesn't spoil the film in any way. During the scenes with Susie Salmon in ""heaven"" it definitely adds to it because after all it is all about her ""perfect world""...it's not likely to be realistic. The acting in this film is spot on, especially by Saoirse Ronan. You begin to really feel for her character and share the happiness she feels at the end of the film. It's safe to say Ronan has a successful acting career ahead of her.It doesn't happen very often, but this film touched my heart. I hope more people enjoy it as much as I did!",The Lovely Bones
629,peter-cathbad-host,"Bigger than Death - Brilliant, Beautiful and Gothic - certainly Peter Jackson's most poetic film",10,12 April 2010,"I truly do not understand why this amazing film is so underrated. Being a huge fan of Alice Sebold's novel and of Peter Jackson's works since Bad Taste, I couldn't wait to see Lovely Bones.If you're in the mood for a light and entertaining movie, you might want to wait for a better moment to really enjoy Lovely Bones. If on the other hand, films like Mysterious Skin or American Beauty imprinted you as strongly as they did me, you might want to see it asap.Alice Sebold's is not a light story. It's sad, it's harsh, it sounds like life. At the same time, it has a ""gothic"" and dreamy quality to it, in which its beauty resides. In my mind's eye at least. I was wondering how all that could be successfully translated into real pictures, and to tell you the truth, I was really excited that a monster-filmmaker like Peter Jackson could chose to come back to life-sized themes, like he did before Lord of the Rings (which I loved as anybody).Not that many a filmmakers dare tackle the Serial Killer & Child Abuser themes, and for a good reason. People as a rule, don't want to watch this sort of stories. If Clint Eastwood's (brilliant) Changeling left me wondering if I would see it ever again, I have no doubt that I'll watch Lovely Bones quite a few times when the DVD/Blueray's out. Because there's something more in Lovely Bones. If Tim Burton's Big Fish was bigger than life, Peter Jackson's Lovely Bones is Bigger than Death.The cast is excellent (ALL of it), the pictures are beautiful, Peter Jackson's camera is as dynamic as ever, and unlike what I've read so far, the movie captures the spirit of the book, and even enhances it so some (visual) degree. The soundtrack suits the mood of the film like a natural second skin, with Brian Eno's amazing soundscapes and incursions of Harold Budd, Robin Guntrie & Elizabeth Frazer.In my opinion, this movie deserves to be in the Top250, and will eventually climb its way up there, as time goes by. Go see it for yourself.And if (as I am) you're a family man, be forewarned, you might cry.",The Lovely Bones
630,adaptle,Bit of a Marmite movie. You love or you hate it,7,14 April 2010,"Seems to be a bit of a Marmite movie. You love or you hate it.My 1st Movie review ever, so be nice  My wife has been reading the book and we put the movie on hold until she completed. She knew the film was out and whilst reading the book would often comment on how they were going to portray the overall feeling and emotion of the book onto the screen which I think is always the issue for all film directors. She really wondered how parts would feature such as Susie's heaven. If you dislike what Jackson has done with the CGI which let's be honest all similar movies (one springs to mind straight the way What Dreams May Come) have always struggled it will perhaps spoil the film for you, it does feature in a large part of the film. We all have our own view on what Heaven would look like and for example if you have read the book you have certain features set out and you fill in the blanks yourself. My wife was very happy with what Jackson did with the CGI and was in very happy with the crumbling gazebo which featured in the movie. Now I hadn't read the book before watching the film and I knew nothing really about the story. I got snippets from my wife as said above whilst she continued her read and I must say I was pleasantly surprised. It was beautifully crafted from the eyes of a innocent girl on what is a very dark tale. I guess what is unfortunate for Jackson is that expectations are so high from his on screen adaptations of LOTR, those that have read the book are going to have mixed feelings as now I am reading the book myself those very dark scenes missing just wouldn't be possible or even comfortable away from paper and in some cases he would have got another battering from those crowds stating it isn't PC to feature and in my personal opinion are just plain weird in the book.I think Jackson got it just about right, don't get me wrong it could have been better but for me it was very believable the acting was spot on and I feel some of the reviews are a little on the unfair side. I wouldn't give it ten out of ten but I think 7 is just about right. Make your own opinion, just like I did with Marmite. I love it!",The Lovely Bones
631,jevcorp,Great Entertainment,10,21 April 2010,"If you are a CGI buff you may be disappointed with the graphics. Like me most people aren't that sophisticated with CGI so it didn't bother me. The storyline wasn't supposed to be a carbon copy of the book but was a great take off of the book. I am glad some things were changed from the book and realistically if the book was done detailed the movie would have to be 5 hours long. Acting was first rate for most of the characters. If you wanted the typical predictable storyline sorry, it's a movie not real life, so some things were not necessarily realistic but that's entertainment. If I wanted real life I would watch a good reality show or look at my neighbors. A good movie stays with you after the film ends. This did that for many who watched.",The Lovely Bones

Thinking about the loss of a loved one and the torture the rest of the family can live through is NOT my idea of a good time. I want my money back AND my 2+ hours. This was not fun. I had attempted to make a small artistic statement by including ""This was not fun."" as one word per line.

Well, I have not actually read the book but have heard that the book and movie are different. I honestly could not even finish watching the movie. This movie is highly disturbing! This kind of stuff is way too close to reality, and the sad thing is that this stuff actually happens. So my question, is why visualize the book in this way? The corn field scene where Susie is taken down into this whole in the field was one of the most disturbing scenes and I think unnecessary to be shown. I know this happens but we felt this was way to close to reality. We went into watching this movie thinking it was just a mystery and was not going be this graphic. The bathroom scene where the murderer is in the tub and he's all dirty and blood is everywhere was really gross. It literally at some parts made me feel sick and I had to walk away. The spiritual things in it made me think what the makers were trying to say. Too many movies are made from the stand point of this in between sorta thing, where the character died but isn't in heaven or hell but seems to have some ""unfinished business."" When dreams come true is another movie that has the same kinda feel to it with the in between.

I know how that works, such as harry potter books, and lord of the ring movies in congruence with their portrayals on the big screen. Personally this was one of the more powerful films I have seen all year. The Protagonist in this film is incredibly creepy, and just the sight of him on the screen gives you the chills. To put things in shorter terms, it really does put things in perspective when it comes to victims of kidnappings in the world. The crumbling of the family, and the willingness of hope and ability to cope with such a terrible loss. Some parts of this movie were pretty graphic and almost made me second guess it's movie rating due to its graphic nature. This movie definitely caught me by surprise, I was thinking it was going to be another lame movie like ""the invisible"". So to put things plainly, I guess if you've read the book and enjoyed it, don't come into the movie with high expectations because I guess you won't get them?

While I certainly looked forward to the release of this, is it was one of those the rare cases where I was swayed from the movie theater based on these comments. It is, in fact, a movie worth your time in viewing. It's not The Godfather, but it certainly is not Plan 9 From Outer Space.Read the other reviews, but don't pass up this movie. Decide for yourself. There are as much plot holes as you will find in any mainstream movie so don't despair.This is one of those occasions where I should have gone with my gut and saw it in a movie theater and not on HBO.

636,forth_armoury,Not at all what I expected,6,14 August 2010,"I did not know that this movie was based on a novel, so obviously I never read the novel. The movie was not what I had expected at all. I knew before hand that this was a movie about a girl who had been murdered, and her ghost.I assumed that this was going to be a story similar to ""Ghost"", staring Demi Moore and Patrick Swayze, in that I expected someone to be murdered, and then the ghost of the murdered person to help those who survived them move on and ultimately extract vengeance on the murderer.The movie sets us these expectations from the beginning, where we are shown who the murderer is, and we see the murdered girl's ghost interacting with the supposedly socially outcast girl. It is further reinforced by the father seeing her outside his window, and her brother claiming to have seen her and been kissed on the cheek.So we have this set-up where we are expecting some kind of supernatural assistance with solving the murder crime.And it never happens.OK, maybe in the most obtuse way, the father is tipped off to the murderer in the scene where he is helping the murderer build his ""duck blind"". But in no way does this correspond to the murdered girl's sister who ultimately finds the evidence of who committed the murder.So I guess I was disappointed because I was expecting a supernatural ghost story, when in fact it's just about a ghost watching the world of the living. I was expecting supernatural assistance in nailing the murderer, and it never comes.We have some satisfaction in seeing an icicle make the murderer fall over a cliff, but it is unclear whether this is a supernatural event or not. It feels contrived.",The Lovely Bones

The parts of the movie set in the real world could've been worked on to real effect and in themselves created an awesome movie but the awful cut scenes in the ""blue horizon"" made me lose all feeling and/or empathy for the characters.

I still have tears in my eyes and a rage in my heart for wanting to see justice served as I write this.For all those that got their panties in a twist over the CGI, for my take I saw it as a surrealistic view of the 'in between'. So if you are so shallow and unfeeling as to focus on the CGI then you missed the message and perhaps are not watching movies for how they can impact our lives.This subject matter is a non-starter, yet Peter Jackson and the cast brought energy and a different take on 'life' than how we as people tend to view 'things'.

This is a emotional movie so prepare some tissues; i cried myself. Honestly I can't get the sense of why some people argue about the special effects and the setting of the movie? I've always had this mindset of how i perceive any movies,or books etc..; everyone has different unique given creativity of mind and that's what makes it beautiful. This movie was Peter Jackson's unique given creativity, why can't they accept that or respect that? Negative Criticizing only shows our mentality mindset of controlling others the way we want them to think or perceive, and that, there's no beauty in at all.

In the end, the dozens of women that her murderer murdered meet in the ""in between"" and go onto Heaven together.

I read a lot of the reviews of this movie and I just don't see why everyone is blasting it! I admit, the animations were a little overdone, and the movie is a bit off from the book, but overall I thought it delivered a wonderful message and will make young women more aware of what's really out there in the world.

I think that was a good thing, because after having read some of the reviews of this title afterwards, I couldn't help but notice that the most negative reviews came from people who had read the book. I have to agree with both the negative and positive reviews, there are both good and bad things about this movie. First: I thought that the CGI was beautiful, but too much - it didn't do anything for the story. On the other hand, it is a beautiful story, if you understood it, I'm sure you would leave the theater, or where ever it has been seen, with some sort of experience. Sadly I didn't see much of the story when I saw the movie, in fact I was confused most of the time. There was too much of the plot that wasn't explained. And on top of that, I wasn't touched, had any kind of thought after seeing it.Maybe I am a cold, heartless person? Yes, when it comes to movies, I am. I rarely cry (Unless it's because of laughter) or show any other emotion, especially not in sad, tragic ones. When all of this have been said, I don't think that the cast or director have been bad choices. I think that the story might have been wrong for the big screen. Some book just HAVE to be made into a movie, and some just shouldn't.Sadly I think, this is one of them. I don't think that this is a bad movie, I have just seen better.

I congratulate Peter Jackson on handling a horrific subject with tenderness and gentleness. The music, sound design and imaginative visuals were wonderful and enveloping. A heart wrenching story, handled with mastery and care. In a word poetic.I'm scratching my head wondering why more folks didn't enjoy the film. I would consider it one of the most stirring films I've seen. The word that keeps coming to mind is POETIC. And I guess either you are one who likes poetry or not. If you don't this film is probably not for you. The blanks are not all filled in you have to bring your imagination with you. Yes there were details I wondered about, like how the heck did he lift that safe all by himself out of the basement and into the car no less. And could also see where more mystery at the beginning might have lent an air of surprise or where that kind of ""Shutter Island"" handling might have engaged more viewers. I don't know. For myself I'm glad Jackson did not use such devices, what was there haunting and unforgettable and I'm sure will make me return to seeing this film again.Spoiler: Mr. Jackson gave us just enough horror and pathos to catch the idea but always pulled us back from utter darkness to keep the film light yet dramatic. I was glad we did not have to watch the rape or other dark grueling details of the crimes. I have seen enough of this type of ugliness and depravity in film and am personally tired of it. Evil can come in many shapes and forms, including a seemingly benign neighbor who grows flowers and builds dollhouses.There were spots that reminded me of ""What Dreams May Come"" a small distraction which I didn't mind because that is a favorite film of mine.",The Lovely Bones

Well the movie is about a girl who gets murdered and all of the events that take place after her death. And to keep things short, I spent the whole movie wanting the murderer to get really get what he deserved, and in a way he does, but it just left me rather unsatisfied. I feel as though he deserved more than what he got. As for most of the rest of the movie, it kept me on edge. I found myself wanting to yell at the characters through the TV though because, like people do in many movies, everyone just kept on being stupid.

The movie, however, is overloaded with fantasy scenes with too-loud sounds, and it omits much of the thoughtful narration of the murdered girl. The movie veers from mystery to fantasy, back and forth, satisfying neither format. Sadly, a fine book was made into a really bad movie. The acting is generally excellent. The music, as opposed to fantasy sounds, is excellent. The locales are authentic and well-shot. The writing of dialog in the real-life ""mystery"" scenes is good. But there is an abundance of fantasy scenes which for us added nothing and frustrated our enjoyment of the plot and good acting. We kept thinking and hoping that the fantasy part was over, but it kept coming back. There's also a thriller aspect to the movie, and this part is well-done, but it's also overwhelmed by the excessive fantasy scenes. This is a sad expression of a fine book. The credits are extraordinarily long. We think that a good movie could have been made with half the credited cast.",The Lovely Bones

That is hard to portray on the film, but from what I watched & enjoyed, it was good. No one knows what is it like in the afterlife, & if there were someone who could tell us, then it would not be a fantasy fiction movie. It took me watching 3 times to really get the jest of the theme of the movie. I liked when Susie was trying to hold on to life to understand, why the nut did this to her, & also trying to give her family signs of the real killer. Walsh did a great job in acting the part of the father who would not give up on finding his daughter's killer, & when he figured out who it was. In my opinion of the afterlife, it was a lot of symbolisms, that most people did not understand or want to understand. It was a movie that made you think & feel.

All I can say is, I cannot believe I watched to the very end. It was one of the most inane, inarticulate pieces of abstract rubble I have ever seen or heard. The scenes of the ""place in between"" were laughable and tedious. The victims endless diatribe about her feelings and what happens after death were beginning to make me feel angry and annoyed by her very voice. I literally cannot think of anything redeeming about this movie, not even Stanley Tucci could make it palatable. Let me put it this way, ""The Lovely Bones"" made ""What Dreams May Come"" look like a great film. I was impressed with the cast, Stanley Tucci, Susan Sarandan and Rachel Weisz, but they were given nothing to work with in this film. I had no idea Peter Jackson directed it until the credits at the end. He should just stick with Hobbits and Wizards. He did do his usual CGI overload in this movie, but lacked the beauty of New Zealand in the background and made up for it with what looked like flashbacks to old episodes of ""The Monkees"".

I usually do not mind about official critics and I do not know what did Mr X acknowledged film critic wrote about it. For me the film was really good cinema and I really loved it which is far more important. My congratulations to Peter Jackson for this work. It was a whisper in the ear and a warm glimpse in the eye but only for a clean ear and a pure eye. A material like that and the after life issue is the number one question mark of human existence and confronting death is the at most personal matter of the at most experience.

This is a summation of what indeed is lacking.,8,25 April 2011,"I was quite blown away by the film, but that turned to disappointment when I read the book. The novel is far more complex and explores so much of our emotions. What irked me was the almost anal retentive reduction of the pivotal love scene in the book, where Suzie makes love and consummates her love for her still alive boyfriend. As an adult, I would not have been satisfied with a kiss, nor was the author, who made central the whole premise of finding peace. The love making may have been implied, but I missed the subtlety. Was that a result of the film being set in America? It certainly would not have been typical of a European or Australian film.Also, re the death of the pedophile and murderer, did he arrive at the same nether world as Suzie Salmon? I left the cinema feeling unfulfilled, yet strangely emotional and other worldly. I guess it took me a day to reset my thinking.",The Lovely Bones
650,jleepiller,A Movie that is a Work of Art...,9,9 May 2011,"Maybe I am biased. I have been watching Peter Jackson movies well before he became known for Lord of the Rings. The interesting thing about this film, for myself, is that I watched the movie several times before I discovered it was a Peter Jackson film (I sort of lost touch after King Kong).It is my belief that this is the type of movie someone who has experienced profound and sudden loss will resonate with immediately. The first time I watch this film I was so caught up in my identification of that type of loss that I did not have the capacity to pick apart the CGI and other nuances.Therefore, I feel this movie is experienced based on the experiences of the individual observer. How one interprets grief and and loss, and how emotionally intelligent one is to that type of loss.I give a high score, because I watch this movie about twice a month. I have been pulled into the story line and life of the characters. This is not a movie one sees to meet the need of experiencing a cultural blockbuster film. This movie is a piece of art. This is a movie one experiences through emotion.",The Lovely Bones

652,michaelpburns,Great movie inside a terrible movie,9,22 September 2012,"I saw this movie on HBO a few years ago and was beyond transfixed. I thought it was arresting and so incredibly creative, insightful, and emotionally moving... but, I didn't see it from the beginning. I caught it about 10 or 12 minutes in. I hadn't heard much about the film aside from Terry Gross interviewing Stanely Tucci on NPR before it came out, so I was curious to read the rave reviews.I was totally shocked to see the mixed reaction, and frankly mostly poor reviews. The film the critics were describing barely matched the movie I had seen. Confused, I watched it again- this time from the start.Wow, a totally different experience. Night and day.IMO, this film has a massive construction flaw. What's narrated in the first 10 minutes changes the entire tension of the film. The single key event's outcome in the movie is already told to you at the opening. It drains the core of the movie, leaving you to watch the excellent acting performances and go through the motions of the rest of the movie without the heart of it. I have never seen a film that was so undercut by the opening exposition. Perhaps this is following the book- I didn't read the book yet so I don't know- but if that's the case, it was a disastrous decision.So... if you're interested in watching this film, please fast forward about 10 minutes, to the high school play scene, and start from there. You'll absolutely love it. Watch from the beginning and be warned.",The Lovely Bones

It's as if the reviewers took in the first 20 seconds and then quit watching and stared mockingly at the CGI bits. Like many movies, this movie really won't be for everyone, (I'm assuming this is where the bad reviews come from) but for those of us who enjoy thought provoking and on edge movies, this one definitely takes the cake. I stopped watching movies and TV because everything that comes to view lately has left me bored to tears. The CGI's may have been used a little too much, but it does nothing to hinder the movie,the feeling of a dream quality rather envelopes the watcher and brings you to (almost) tears in just the right moments. The situational realism, left you feeling like, this could be you, this could happen. Suspenseful scenes such as where Lindsey Locates ""something"" had us almost screaming with frustration (of the good sort) And the relationship of the cast, leaves you adoring,happy, angry and even heartbroken. When a movie leaves you feel like a manic person by the end...I'm just saying, that's a good movie!",The Lovely Bones
654,KiwiMovieLover,"Great film with drama, tears and scares",7,30 December 2009,"I wasn't wanting to see this film originally - it looked like it would be too long of a movie to hold my interest. However the film did in fact not drag for me and it maintained my interest throughout. Also with all the reviews mentioning their dislike for the film, I had to check it out for myself - which I recommend those of you who are in two minds in whether to see it or not should give it a try.Reasons for holding my interest: - there are comedic scenes - I did shed a few tears - I also wanted to turn away from the screen sometimes and run for a few of the characters as the movie is a bit of a thriller at times - I really liked the Heavenly Creatures film and if you enjoyed the fantasy scenes from it you will especially enjoy the CGI effects of this movie.The movie has a few annoying features and the conclusion was frustrating for me (I was wanting a character to speak up about something she knew) - but I think this is similar to how the book concluded (which I haven't read). In conclusion I do not believe this film will cater for everyone - but all I can say it held my attention and it's worth giving it a shot because of the mixture of comedic, emotional and gripping scenes.",The Lovely Bones

It was so off the charts God awful that I would have thought he'd be too embarrassed to put himself in it in a cameo - ala Hitchcock - but nope (the sound you here is Hitchcock rolling over in his grave by the way!) And not only does he put himself in it, holding a camera in a film store no less, (GET it? Huh? Huh?) But it's actually SO distracting in an otherwise dismal film because he stays on himself so long to make sure every retard in the back row of the theater is sure to spot him. RIDICULOUS!

658,circlefusionred,Great performances betrayed by Peter Jackson's own ego.,2,30 November 2009,"Very bad adaptation of the celebrated novel that betrays the heart and soul of the book with a visual effects mess that boulders on overkill. Great actors like Rachel Weisz, Susan Sarandon and Mark Wahlberg are left holding the bag for Peter Jackson's own ego, whose more interested in showing off what he could do with the latest technology in visual effects than actually trying to be faithful to the book he's adapting. I understand that movie adaptations are rarely as close to the book but when the whole essence of the novel is thrown away in order to please a director's ego, then that's inexcusable. Weisz, Sarandon and Wahlberg are only playing hollow shells of the characters that were in the book and all of them do their best with what is given but the lack of any real characterization betrays their solid efforts. Saoirse Roan and Stanley Tucci are good but that's because the movie shifts its focus on them and the murder investigation other than try to tell the family drama , which was the heart and soul of the novel.Skip this travesty and read the book instead.",The Lovely Bones
659,daniwoo,Too much heaven - not enough earth,4,5 January 2010,"What a waste! I heard there were app. 5 hrs of film and this is what we're left with! For the record, I HAVE read the book, however I know certain modifications are necessary when bringing a book to the big screen.At least Jack Salmon (Mark Wahlberg) got his chance to shine as Susie's father late in the day after PJ tried to make him out to be a lunatic: accusing each and almost everyone of their male neighbours! In the book he built the ""hide"" with Harvey much earlier and he was his one and only suspect. To me that made the whole thing more poignant - he knew who had killed Susie and no-one, not even his wife would believe him. Lindsey did, however. And Rose McIver carried this off beautifully, in the movie.It seemed - as others have said - that PJ was more interested in CGI than the characters. What a shame. Heaven was part of this movie but the people left behind were equally important and gave the story the substance it required.Susan Sarandon was the PERFECT Grandma Lynn! She came back into their lives and shook them all up. Made everything better for a while. I guess that wasn't really carried through in the movie.In a way, I felt this movie was made for people who had read the book: ""don't mind if I miss this part - you know why Abigail's leaving - so I don't need to flesh it out"". Afterwards my friends who had not read the book were saying: ""Why did this happen?"" ""Why did that happen?""

It brings up the tragedy of love after death but not from the viewpoint of the ones left behind but from the perspective of the ones who have departed. The backgrounds are impressive as well as the changes of scenes and the work presented by the camera. I had heard the the film was boring and that the acting was not very impressive. They both seem appropriate to the original idea in mind. The story has no huge twists or turns but it works out just as the book works out as an interesting approach to storytelling. I would like to recommend that viewers read the book as well as see the movie. In that way they can appreciate how the author and the director have presented their own versions of the same story.",The Lovely Bones
662,StarTetrahedron99,A Gothic beauty.,9,28 April 2012,"Like many others who enjoyed The Lovely Bones I was shocked at the lukewarm and even downright angry/negative reviews this film got. I can appreciate this film is certainly not for everyone, but I would have expected at least a solid 7.5 on IMDb, especially since (imo, the far inferior) Black Swan, another ""weird"" film about altered states of reality did so well. To be honest, I guess the film blew me away so much I overlooked some of the pitfalls and could only see them in retrospect. Unfortunately I don't think it's so much the film's ""weirdness"" that is to blame for poor reviews and box office numbers so much as a simple confusion over the target audience as I'll explain below and the subsequent marketing. Anyhow I'll break down The Lovely Bones: The Good: Although the film contains no explicit gore I counted 3 scenes in The Lovely Bones which truly chilled me to the bone and continued to haunt me for days after I had seen the movie. The only other movie that springs to mind as having done that is The Exorcist. This is coming from a person who found Blair Witch Project to be more funny than scary.-The whole concept of the movie. This movie has one of the most revolutionary central concepts I have seen since The Matrix. The Lovely Bones hinges around the idea that there are other ""levels"" or ""densities"" of reality existing within the same space as the reality that we are usually aware of, which are no less real than our own, just less visible. Roger Ebert wrote ""The Lovely Bones is a deplorable film with this message: If you're a 14-year-old girl who has been brutally raped and murdered by a serial killer, you have a lot to look forward to. You can get together in heaven with the other teenage victims of the same killer... Sure, you miss your friends, but your fellow fatalities come dancing to greet you in a meadow of wildflowers, and how cool is that?"" I agree that would indeed be a very grim message. If it indeed was the message. However that is to miss the entire main point of the movie which is that Suzie is NOT in heaven. She remains in a place in between out of her own strong desire to help her family find closure. This in between place is naturally less satisfying than either heaven or earth because it is not designed to be a permanent home for the human soul. Although some have ridiculed the CGI, much of Jackson's environment really is akin to some things I've heard described in near death experiences, albeit simplified. Personally the visuals took my breath away and lasted not a minute too long.-The acting. Stanley Tucci's role could so easily have been a cardboard cut-out stereotype. But Tucci does such an incredible job as the sadistic Mr. Harvey that he turns this on its head - you actually start seeing *where* the stereotype (and all stereotypes contain a grain of truth) comes from to begin with. Saoirse Ronan is so good as Susie Salmon that I actually started to become quite angry that our world had been deprived of such youthful energy and innocence and I had to remind myself it was only a film! She really reminded me of being fourteen all over again. Mark Wahlberg and Rachel Weisz give a totally convincing and sensitive performance as Susie's grieving parents. Newcomer Rose McIver is also an actress to watch. Her Lindsay Salmon is someone you could just imagine as your sister growing up! The bad: The director and screenwriters have made one basic, crucial mistake. Just because the protagonist is a child does not mean the movie therefore should be a family movie or targeted at children/tween. Again, the Exorcist springs to mind. I'm not suggesting Jackson should have turned this into a slasher flick, but his source material is simply too dark for a PG film. He did not need to fill Lovely Bones full of swearing, sex and blood, but he should have given us more investigation into the nature of evil as this film was really not the place for any sugar and spice. The result is that Lovely Bones goes back and forth between kid's flick type screenplay and some very dark adult themes and chilling moments. These simply do not make easy bedfellows. As others have pointed out, the puppy love subplot doesn't really add anything to the story and feels like something they tacked on at the last minute to suck in the Twighlight crowd. Thankfully it is only a very minor part of the movie.My overall verdict? A flawed masterpiece. A Gothic beauty of a movie that will stay with me forever.",The Lovely Bones

670,PaulIsDeadMissHim,"A lot of people obviously didn't ""get"" this movie",8,24 January 2010,"I don't understand why people are having such a hard time with this movie, or have dismissed it as horrible CGI nonsense...If you have ever suffered a close family loss like that of a sister or parent, then you can connect with this movie. This isn't the kind of movie I usually see, I prefer action/horror/sci-fi oriented films, but something drew me to this one. Some reviewers have pointed out the film's somewhat casual address of the problems of Susie's family after her passing. If this film is taken from the point of view of Susie, which it obviously is meant to, due to her narration, then this makes sense. It's a pretty common belief, IMHO, that anyone who dies moves on to a better place, and the problems of mortal existence are almost irrelevant in comparison. This wouldn't mean that you stopped caring about those you left behind, but rather are anticipating their arrival in the afterlife. The reason Susie still was afraid for her father as he was being attacked, however, is because she still hadn't fully realized/completed her journey to the other side. Once that was done, she knew that her mortal affairs no longer mattered, which can explain the lighthearted mood of the ending. As for the CGI, I found it breathtaking, and honestly don't see how the film could have done without it. Susie's own personal ""in-between"" mirrored her emotional state at the time, and was marvelously executed. I also agree with the handling of the murderer's execution, and felt it better to leave the nature of his death as a result of ""natural causes"" somewhat uncertain. It also wasn't really important to see the manner of Susie's passing, this makes her murder even more of a grievous offense, and elevates Tucci's character to a far darker place. Finally, I was glad that there were moments in the film to break the overall sad tone, as it shows a family trying for the most part to move on with life after such a tragic loss. Anyone who had experienced anything remotely similar to this must see this film.",The Lovely Bones

The suspense scenes were fantastic (particularly the one in Harvey's house with Susie's sister looking for evidence), but then it would go on sort of an acid trip in some of the heavenly scenes. In full disclosure, I have not read the book, which I've heard is very good, so I can't make a fair comparison. However, it felt sort of ""dumbed down"" from what I've heard about the book. I would have liked to see more character development of Ray and Ruth - they sort of felt just thrown into the story without a lot of background info, but maybe it was the same way in the book.

676,hawsman2-1,An undeniable failure of a movie,2,5 January 2010,"Is this what we have to expect for 2010? What a pathetic first limp for movies in this decade. The movie is focused around the story of Suzie Salmon, her family, and her life in Purgatory (or as her cliché'd kid brother would cryptically call it ""The In-Between place""). Heinously murdered, she clings to material world and watches her family through their grieving and their search to find her killer. A good cast, a hell of a budget, a creepy villain we can easily hate, a bright eyed kid, and a director known for using everything at it's absolute potential, and everything just came apart. The story was abysmal, where most of it was useless and unnecessary. Suzie's presence in the real world was way too ethereal and way too minimal. She might as well never have been there at all. As for what happens outside of her world, everything is either way too predictable, way too out-of-character, or way too random and unexplained. Then we have the characters. Instead of having an endearing and likable main character, we're instead left with a pissy whiny brat of a girl who just won't shut up about being dead. We're subjected to a melodramatic whine fest about being dead the ENTIRE movie, all told in the form of bad poetry and wicked awful, wicked obvious symbolism. Alive she was an unlikeable stuck-up brat. In death, she was a empty, self-absorbed emo. The family weren't any better (with the exception of the Dad who was actually likable half the time). Everybody lacked emotion, and never gave us any reason to like them or care about them. The kid brother is virtually non-existent, and the mother and sister make brief and pathetic cases for our attention.The only reason I kept this from being a 1 is the fact that the villain of the movie was both believable, and easy to hate. Stanley Tucci transformed himself into a monster and kept my attention every time he was on the screen. STAY AWAY FROM THIS MOVIE!!!",The Lovely Bones

678,caitlynnicole-95,Non-spoiler containing rant about CGI use,6,10 May 2014,"The only reason I gave this a 6/10 is only because I personally don't like them as much as others, but it still is a good QUALITY movie. The plot is great, but in comparison to the book, I wish they would've made it more accurate. Nonetheless, the actors are really fantastic. I love movies of this genre that have a fairly unknown actor as the main character. But, the one thing I'd like to especially address are all these people's reviews complaining about ""over use"" of CGI. If you haven't noticed, the movie is under the drama and FANTASY genre, so of course it's going to contain a lot of CGI work. When the director made Lord of the Rings did people complain about CGI use in that? No, because it is a FANTASY movie. Avatar, the Harry Potter saga, the Twilight saga, almost every superhero movie, The Hobbit, the Hunger games and Catching Fire, just to take a FEW out of the thousands of fantasy movies out there and nobody critiques the amount of CGI (maybe the quality, but no the amount). So what is the problem? Anyway, this movie isn't everyone's ""cup of tea"", but that goes for any movie in general.

Thanks to Peter Jackson for bringing us this movie.Kudos to the cast for standout performances, particularly Mark Wahlberg, who showed he has more range than some would expect. And a young, and exceptionally talented, Saoirse Ronan. She was a delight, and heartbreaking at the same time. As a student of music, I appreciate good soundtracks. ""The Lovely Bones"" has an ethereal, moving, and perfectly suited score. It does what a soundtrack is supposed to do, enhancing the emotions of the film, without being a distraction. On a more personal level: if you've ever lost someone close to you, particularly to the type of violent predator depicted in this movie, this will be extremely hard to get through. However, it may also offer some form of encouragement. Wahlberg and Ronan's interactions struck me as authentic, and engendered pleasant memories of my own. This picture gave me a sense of encouragement, and offered some peace of mind.",The Lovely Bones
680,effyfails,Surprisingly good,9,17 February 2015,"***tried to avoid spoilers, shouldn't be any or anything that's not already mentioned in other reviews but if there is anything apologies!***I never even thought to see this film in the past for various reasons. I just didn't feel the need to see it, I don't like very many films, people at school had to watch it for a project and seemed to dislike it and I didn't really know what it was about. Now I can assume that those who disliked it at school didn't understand it or would rather just not be doing it in class, to be fair, at my school when analyzing a film you'd have to pause and re-watch scenes over and over so it would be tedious. Anyway, this came on TV and I thought why not, I'm quite interested in murder cases and such so thought I could watch it for that aspect. One thing I have to note, may be very irrelevant, I absolutely hate any love interests in films or soppy moments, however I quite like the 'love' part with Susie and Ray, it's very innocent, cute and understated. Almost perfect, it was sweet. I also am not one to cry and films, or even feel. I really hate when a film tries to make you feel certain ways but by the end of this film I instantly reflected and felt very sad, I don't mean that as a bad point. The acting was also very good, interesting story line and there wasn't really any parts where it made you lose interest a bit where you'd think oh I'll just wait to see where it goes kind of thing there was always something questioning or answering. The only thing for me was that when the murder happens you know pretty much nothing as to what happened. It's all quite, obviously, implied. It's very likely just my personal preference as I hate not knowing and I'm used to watching murder cases where they describe what happened, I guess you do learn a little more but quite a bit later on and again not as much as I would have hoped but I can easily see why. The visuals are good but - as it has been pointed out sooo much - at times it can be a bit too much or just too obviously fake looking. In the inbetween, unrealistic world parts it's OK and makes sense but is where it tends to be a bit too much, trying so very hard to make it look so unbelievably that it really is a little too much but it doesn't really matter. There's only a couple of parts that it's supposed to be realistic where the effects are slightly off but may just be due to a budget, I don't know. I don't really know what to say other than it's incredibly interesting and emotional. I want to know even more. Worth watching.",The Lovely Bones

The story of 14 year old Susie Salmon passing from life to death after her brutal murder is an amazing story. It gives you a full experience so you feel Susie's anger, sorrow, frustration, and joy as she watches her loved ones from ""the in between"". If you don't mind shedding a tear as you see the obstacles Susie faces watching her friends and families lives continue slowly on with out her it teaches you about the danger of strangers.All in all this movie is one of my favorites and in the end will give you a sense of peace at the end of the film.",The Lovely Bones

Even for an Oscar nominee if it had been properly done but now that i have seen it, it's a big NO! My God! It was AWFUL! Don't get me wrong, Stanley Tucci was awesome and the cast was really good with Susan Sarandon, Rachel Weisz and Mark Wahlberg but that was it! Peter Jackson had the good story, a perfect drama and the great cast but he had to go with the CGI EFFECTS and ruin everything. This was not a movie for that. Honestly, i thought they totally made this movie less serious.CGI effects here was a bad decision! Besides, i think he went too over the top with the ""heavenly images"". Too many. The movie was a huge disappointment! I agree with the one who wrote that the movie was like Mystic River meeting Alice in Wonderland. That was perfect. Personally, i liked them both, mainly Alice but not together. If you do, you'll get this mess.",The Lovely Bones

I think for those who have a lot of questions that those added details would have answered them. The book was very descriptive of Susie's whereaboutsDon't get me wrong most definitely enjoyed the film!!!I really believe that this movie could have easily gone for another hour and I would have enjoyed it just the same But all the missing details upsets me I would have loved to ""learn"" more about Harveys history and Abigails affair Like I said So much missing",The Lovely Bones
685,farah_rao,****SPOILER ALERT****,3,7 September 2020,"I am kind of a person who can enjoy 4hr long drama if the story is gripping. But this movie didn't make any sense whatsoever. For starters you meet a very smart 14 year old girl who ends up being fooled by a guy in the middle of no where. That was a little hard to digest. After that, this movie takes a Charlie in the chocolate factory kind of turn, when the fantasy of 'in between' takes over. With hideous visuals and impromptu narration by susie.Okay now come to the main center point, you basically keep on watching this movie in hopes that 1) susie's parents might find the body 2) the killer might get caught and punished. Neither of these things happen. Frustration peaks when you see Susie's younger sister running around town alone, when everyone knows there is a killer on loose. Frustration peaks further when half of the characters become impulsive and just go buy instinct because somehow susie sending them vibes that next door neighbor is the one. Now cherry on top her younger sister takes matters into her own hands breaks into the killers house almost gets caught, but she finds the diary in which he planned the murder. OKAY now i was anxiously waiting for her to take it to the police but no she stands there to see her parents make out. Anyways the killer gets away and the body is never found. So basically with pathetic plot you don't even get a satisfying end.",The Lovely Bones

687,funkbomb,A visually bloated film anchored by its intellectual timidity,1,5 January 2010,"Considering Peter Jackson's vast directorial experience, he should know that modern studio audiences are tame to having their heartstrings yanked like a one-armed bandit. It's a mostly hit and miss situation, but if you feed enough coins into the machine, eventually there's a connection and a big payout to collect. But you haven't really earned it, have you? Such is the problem with Lovely Bones. While Jackson furiously pushes all the emotional buttons, the film is about as satisfying as living off of Keno winnings—fun and feels nice, but in the end, have you really accomplished anything? Short summary: the film centers on the story of a grieving father searching for a conclusion to the unsolved murder of his daughter while she watches from beyond the grave. A creepy neighbor is suspected. Conflict ensues.Sebold And Party are content with shuttling us from one kiddie-sized heart wrench to another. At one point in the film, the hapless main dead-daughter-in-purgatory bellows ""it's beautiful!"" at a shimmering horizon of picturesque beauty that looks like a default desktop background. ""Of course it is,"" her ethnic companion exclaims. ""It's heaven!"" As if I needed more reason to shoot myself by this point. Jackson apparently thinks that a film's terra firma is found in front of a green screen. When you think you just can't take any more, the Alcoholic Grandmother steps in for some comic relief and tries to assemble a vacuum cleaner. A touch of feel-good vibe makes the medicine go down, apparently, even when the medicine is already as sugary-sweet as it gets.This is pretty much the situation throughout Bones as we're cuckolded with this Disney Channel dialog throughout. The poor-girl-we-must- relate-to almost joins us in the theater seats as she watches from the sidelines (actually, a gazebo. were you expecting sophistication here?) the goings-on of the mortals still on Earth solving her murder. As she pleads and begs from the patio on life's b-side for her father to turn back from a cornfield at night where evil Ned Flanders lies in wait, she (we?) watches helplessly as daddy is brutally beaten—by a teenager who mistakes him for an attacker. Almost every worn-out cliché is taken down off the shelf as we watch all the innocents eat dirt and the ones who deserve it walk away in dirty boots, an apparent effort to maximize heartache that can only be perceived as desperate. Never mind that the bad guy is the only remotely antagonistic character in the whole movie—thank goodness I've only one creep with a chevron mustache to look out for—and don't worry, unrealistic bullish high school jock with the hot girlfriend, we've got you covered too.The 'afterlife' Jackson and Sebold envision for this movie is apparently exactly what we've been told for about as long as time itself—babbling brooks, low gravity, liquid peeps and rainbows of candy. So perfect, in fact, that one wonders if any creative thought was put into this film at all. Synecdoche, NY this is not. As she sleds down puffy-white hills of snow, laughing all the way, one half-expects an impossibly cute polar bear cub to pop out and hand her a Coke. The dearth of visual complexity and sophistication wouldn't normally be a problem, except this is where the main character hangs out for about ninety percent of the film. They make bus stops more interesting than this.Oh, and the bad guy eats it in the end, and I refuse to label this a spoiler. Seriously, were you expecting anything different going into this? All in all, a visually bloated film anchored by its intellectual timidity and disparaging unoriginality.",The Lovely Bones

This is one of my absolute favorite movies, have watched it at least 10 times. Every girl between the age of 12 and 17 should watch this movie. It teaches a lot of lessons about what can happen when you trust strangers.The movie was suspenseful and very well done. Peter Jackson's films, in my mind, are always brilliant, and this one is no exception. This one is even more exceptional because it will teach teenagers what can happen if they find themselves alone with an adult they don't know. I think many of the reviews about this movie miss this point.Tons of suspense in this movie, and if you want to take a trip back in time to the 1970's this movie will resonate with you.

I grew up in Norristown, Pennsylvania shortly after the time that the story would have taken place. According to the book, that was the approximate location of where the story takes place. Everything in the set design and location is spot on as to what it looked like during that time frame. It was incredibly eerie because there is a farm across the street from the High School (Norristown Area HS)and a field where all of the dark parts of the story take place. They really did their homework and did a fabulous job of re-creating the setting of the story. Parts of the movie were shot in towns around Norristown/West Norriton, which really paints a picture of what the area looked like back then. Thanks for re-creating a part of the past and showing off my hometown (even though it is a fictional story).",The Lovely Bones

698,dclover72,It was like watching a bad train wreck....,1,17 January 2010,I had heard such wonderful things about the book and decided to read it...I could not put it down. The power of this story and the feeling of what lies in the hereafter and how people cope with death and the grieving process and what lies beyond was overwhelmingly powerful. I was extremely excited to watch the movie...what a disappointment. Truly the worst adaptation of a book that I have seen since they killed Flowers In The Attic. The best parts of the book are manipulated and regenerated so much that you do not even get the true meaning of what truly made this story memorable. Especially the key role that certain characters played that they did not even give the light of day!! What happened to the most important part that Ruth played??? The characters do not even get a chance to grow up for goodness sake!!! The whole point of the story is how the dead and the undead cope after wards! There are not enough bad things I can say about this movie.TERRIBLE TERRIBLE TERRIBLE MOVIE!! My advice...read the book and just skip the movie...your own imagination can paint a better picture and you will come out of it with a much better and enlightening experience.,The Lovely Bones
699,verchotaman,A Very Divided Film,4,26 January 2010,"The Gist: Based on the best-selling novel by Alice Sebold, The Lovely Bones stars Saoirse Ronan as Susie Salmon (yes, like the fish). In the film's first ten minutes, Susie appears to be destined for a long life of romance, happiness, and photography when runs into her neighbor, Mr. Harvey, on her way home from school. The crafty Mr. Harvey (played by Stanley Tucci) lures Susie into a clubhouse he built underneath a cornfield, where he eventually rapes and murders poor Susie. The remaining 120 minutes is devoted to the aftermath, which comprises mostly of the Salmon family sleuthing out suspects with the help of Detective Len Fenerman (played by Michael Imperioli) and failing to recuperate. All the while, though, Susie is watching over the Salmons as well as her killer from the comfort of a digital wonderland between heaven and Earth called the ""in-between."" She struggles to balance her urge for revenge with her desire for her suffering family to let go.The Judgment: Director Peter Jackson seems to have been chosen to direct The Lovely Bones due to his innate capability of creating visually stunning new worlds, as he showed us in The Lord of the Rings series and in the modernization of King Kong. Here, Jackson tries his best to weave the real world and Susie's CGI-laden afterlife into a coherent, emotionally driving picture. Unfortunately, the way this movie inorganically switches back and forth from the aftermath on planet Earth to Susie's experience in the in-between makes for an unstable tone and, as a result, a very incoherent film.Now, this is not to say there isn't anything good in The Lovely Bones. It is very well acted and photographed. Ronan gives an eerily solid performance and Mark Wahlberg is also strong as the grieving father, but Stanley Tucci deserves a great deal of acclamation for his performance as the creepy, pedophilic, mass-murdering neighbor. Just a close-up of Mr. Harvey's hauntingly shifty blue eyes gives you an idea of how excellent Tucci is at embodying this dollhouse-building, well-quaffed, mass-murdering fiend. Don't be surprised if this is the year Tucci gets his first Oscar nomination. Also noteworthy is the work from cinematographer Andrew Lesnie, who provides us with a detailed array of crisp and richly colorful shots that contribute very nicely to the plot's progression.However, despite these refreshments, The Lovely Bones could not be salvaged from the misdirection of Peter Jackson. To me, the film was annoyingly divided. On one side, you have the story of the Salmons trying to recover while the killer next-door tries to keep a low profile. This is, despite its sadness, an interesting and captivating tale. And when the Salmons eventually begin to suspect Mr. Harvey, the movie becomes even more suspenseful and even more captivating. Then, of course, there's the other half of the movie featuring the in-between and a skilled staff of special effects artists. Jackson tries to make this place a paradise for young Susie by incorporating numerous aspects of her life into the in-between, which would have been fine. But whenever things were getting interesting back on Earth, the movie abruptly went back to the in-between and Susie's internal conflict. For example, when Susie's younger sister secretly investigates Mr. Harvey, I was captivated by the suspense and became very interested in the film. But in the midst of this very tense moment, we are immediately forced back into the in-between. I was frustrated. I wanted to go back to the interesting story, but I had to sit through another obligatory adventure through Peter Jackson's digital funhouse.And speaking of which, another big problem with The Lovely Bones is the in-between itself. Yes, we know that it's the last stop until heaven and it's filled with lots of components in the life Susie left behind on Earth. But, in the movie, there appear to be rules in the in-between enforced by another victim of Mr. Harvey: a small Asian girl named Holly played by Nikki SooHoo. This keeper of the law vaguely mentions a few of these laws that later play a big part in the plot, which makes things even more bewildering than they already were in the in-between. At the point where I knew in-betweenian law would come into play, I was incredibly confused as to what allowed what was happening to happen. Also, Holly, our tour guide of the afterlife, has a strange tendency of slinking into the shot out of nowhere whenever Susie was watching the latest happenings down below. I felt like I was watching The Grudge and Holly was the ghoulish albino feline monster thing that jumped into scenes out of nowhere and scared people. Yikes!One other major issue I had was the screenwriters' inability to find a solid tone. The script penned by Oscar winners Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens has areas of suspense, comedy, and emotional drama that only make the movie even more divided than it already is. So, because the tone was so uneven, I was rendered unable to care deeply about most of the characters. The exception to this was Mr. Harvey, but only because of how good Stanley Tucci's performance was. How sad is that? The only truly interesting character in a movie about the killing of a fourteen-year old girl is the guy who killed her!Catch It, Rent It, or Skip It: Had the execution not been so unbelievably disjoined, The Lovely Bones could have been one of the year's best films. But, alas, Peter Jackson's vision and the oft-wavering tone of the script hold it back from any such glory; which makes this film well worth skipping.",The Lovely Bones

701,chocoholic54,Was it really THAT bad!!,8,23 February 2010,"Hold on there, was the film really sooooo bad! I read the book a few years ago and found it very disturbing, causing a lot of interesting discussion at my local book group. I knew that the film had received bad reviews so wasn't expecting too much from it.OK, I have just got back from seeing the film here in the UK. The cinema was 3/4 full, and you couldn't hear a pin drop, which believe me at our local cinema is a rare treat! I thought the film was very absorbing, the killer was very very creepy, and the ""inbetween heaven"" sequences, yes, a little clichéd but then unless you have been to that place, who knows what it's like?! It was just an interpretation. I loved the fact that she couldn't quite get to her ""boyfriend"", the closer she got, the harder it was to reach him (boggy field), who hasn't had dreams like that, very nearly there, but not quite making it.Rape was not in fact mentioned or even inferred in the film, it didn't need to be in fact as the way the murder details were dealt with, left a lot to the imagination, Hitchcock style I thought, simply awful.I agree that the scene where the sister finds the book and she says nothing in front of her reacquainted parents was not good, but that's the only bad thing I have to say about the film. Actually another point is the fact that the film was ""based"" upon the book, so didn't in fact have to follow it to the letter.So many reviewers on IMDb have panned it, so many critics have lambasted it, but I for one thought it was excellent, and I need to go and have a hot chocolate to calm my shaken nerves!",The Lovely Bones

The performances by Wahlberg and Ronan, in particular, are very believable.

Perhaps the book may have been better hashed out through a series-adaptation which are increasingly popular? That way the characters could have been more full.
