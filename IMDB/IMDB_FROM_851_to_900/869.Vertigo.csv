0,MartinHafer,Creepy and engaging.,9,31 August 2012,"It's rather strange that this film was a box office flop, as it's one of Alfred Hitchcock's better movies. The only problem with ""Vertigo"" is that in order to really enjoy it, you need to turn off your brain and just accept the movie. If you think the plot out TOO MUCH, you'll find yourself asking too many questions and not just enjoying the film...like my oldest daughter did.The film is the story of a somewhat creepy ex-cop (James Stewart). When the film begins, he's emotionally scarred in an accident-an accident that leaves him with a HUGE case of psychologically-based vertigo. He decides to quit the job and is soon approached by an old friend--who wants to hire him to follow his emotionally disturbed wife. What happens next is very weird--and later becomes really creepy. I could say A LOT more but think it's best you just see the film--it has quite a few twists and turns that are bound to catch you by surprise.Overall, a wonderfully original film. The only deficit, for some, is that although Stewart was a wonderful actor, he was too old for this role. Still, I could look past this and enjoyed it immensely.",Vertigo
1,TheLittleSongbird,"A thriller of undeniable complexity, and impeccably acted and directed-Hitchcock's masterpiece!",10,24 November 2009,"I am a massive Hitchcock fan; this great director ain't called the Master of Suspense for nothing. Anyway, Vertigo is one of the truly great Hitchcocks. It is a thriller of undeniable complexity not only in plot but also in characterisation. It is implausible too i give you that. I will admit the first time I saw this, I didn't understand this, then again this is the sort of film that you need to see more than once. In all departments, this movie is a masterpiece and my all time favourite Hitchcock. For those who say this is the worst movie ever, you would beg to differ if you saw genuine crapfests like Disaster Movie, Home Alone 4, NeverEnding Story 3 and Superbabies:Baby Geniuses 2. They are a trillion times worse than this without a shadow of a doubt.What makes this movie great? When I re watched this, I got goosebumps. It is quite chilling, suspenseful and extremely haunting. The complex plot tells of a retired cop with a terror of heights who is hired by Gavin Elster to follow his suicidal wife. In the end, he falls in love with her but can't stop her falling to her death. Months later he sees a woman bearing strong resemblance to her, and is drawn into a web of deceit and obsession. There are so many strong moments here, especially Scotty following Madeline up the tower only to witness her falling to her death, but also of the San Francissco locations giving a dreamlike quality to an already dark and complex movie. The screenplay is sophisticated and sharp as well. And I have to mention Bernard Hermann's score, it was phenomenal, along with Miklos Rosza's score for Spellbound and Hermann's for Psycho this is the most memorable score in any Hitchcock film, and is guaranteed to have your hairs standing up on the back of your necks.The direction from Hitchcock is simply masterly. The cinematography isn't dated at all. It is stylish and full of contrasts of dark and bright colours, and is also very brooding and intense. I had very little problem with the film's pace and length; in fact let me rephrase that I had no problem with it. I felt actually that Torn Curtain had a much slower pace, and for me that film while good is one of my least favourite Hitchcock movies. The acting I thought was exceptional. Kim Novak starts off a little wooden, but she is certainly very beautiful and enigmatic. In the duel role of the suicidal wife and the woman bearing resemblance to her, she does an in general excellent job, considering both are extremely demanding roles. About James Stewart, whether he was a racist I don't know, but simply I don't care. Whether you are racist or not, it shouldn't matter when it comes to acting and films. What matters is that Stewart was a great actor who rarely gave a bad performance. In this film, he gives one of his best performances, shattering his Mister-Nice-Guy persona with a dark, brooding and truly complex characterisation. Barbara Bel Geddes also gives a terrific performance as Midge.All in all, a superb film, that deserves recognition as one of Hitchcock's best films. Seriously, it is one of the most effective depictions of romantic fatalism in all of cinema. An unforgettable masterpiece, 10/10 Bethany Cox",Vertigo
2,bkoganbing,Detective Obsessed,9,3 December 2005,"Although it got at best mixed reviews when first released, Vertigo is now considered one of Alfred Hitchcock's classic films. A tribute to the players, the director, and the composer of that haunting musical score that will stay with you forever.The music is probably more important here than in most films, let alone most Hitchcock films. Because for most of the first half of the film and a great deal of the second half, it is without dialogue. In fact Kim Novak does not have a spoken line until about 48 minutes into the little more than 2 hour feature. She's under James Stewart's surveillance and the whole story of his growing obsession with her is told through his facial expressions and through Bernard Herrmann's music.Stewart is a cop retired on disability who is hired by an old college friend Tom Helmore to follow his wife. Helmore tells Stewart a tale about his wife falling under the spirit of her dead great grandmother who committed suicide. The wife he's following is played by Kim Novak. Novak in fact makes a suicide attempt and by jumping into San Francisco bay and Stewart jumps in and saves her.In a brief prologue the reason for Stewart's disability is told. While on the police force, he lost a man while pursuing the suspect in a rooftop chase. Another cop was killed trying to save Stewart who had slipped and was hanging on to a roof gutter for his dear life. After that Stewart acquired an understandable fear of heights with accompanying dizziness, vertigo.Later on at an old mission which has significance for Novak's family, Novak runs up to the top of the bell tower and Stewart because of his Vertigo can't pursue her to prevent her from jumping off and taking her life.Later on he spots Kim Novak again with a different color hair and this time essentially stalks her until they meet. By now he's totally obsessed with the dead Novak who he fell in love with.Alfred Hitchcock is plumbing some depths of the human psyche in Vertigo. Certainly good old all American Jimmy Stewart would not be one you would think of casting as a voyeur and a stalker. But he pulls off the performance in probably the film with the least dialogue Alfred Hitchcock ever made since sound came in.Kim Novak is hauntingly beautiful in Vertigo, she has to be or the whole plot would make no sense. Barbara Bel Geddes is in this also as Stewart's girl friend who finds herself losing him to an obsession with a ghost. She also serves as a sounding board for Stewart as he expresses some of his feelings to her.This was the first of two films Stewart and Novak made together. Ironically enough the second one, Bell Book and Candle, is about a witch played by Novak who actually uses witchcraft to ensnare Stewart. Given Stewart's obsession with Novak in Vertigo, if Hitchcock had thrown in witchcraft into the plot, the audience would certainly have believed it.Of course this is an Alfred Hitchcock film and therefore not all is as it seems. I can't sat any more, but there are no happy endings for anyone in this haunting film.",Vertigo
3,Leofwine_draca,Best film of all time? Not by a long shot!,7,10 August 2012,"Sight & Sound magazine recently voted VERTIGO to be the best film of all time. Coincidentally, I'd watched the movie for the first time myself a few days before hand, so I was in a perfect position to evaluate their judgment. And I think they're wrong...dead wrong. For me, VERTIGO isn't even the best Hitchcock movie. I can think of plenty of others that I enjoyed movie: FOREIGN CORRESPONDENT, THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH (1956 version), DIAL M FOR MURDER, PSYCHO, FRENZY, THE BIRDS, REAR WINDOW, NORTH BY NORTHWEST, tjhe list is endless. VERTIGO isn't bad, for sure, but it has plenty of things that are wrong with it and could have been tweaked accordingly.The first is the running time. Combined with the slow nature of the narrative, VERTIGO just feels like it goes on for way too long. And that's not in a good way. As this is a film all about mood, there's little in the way of incident in the narrative. So we get long sequences where Jimmy Stewart is just driving around in his car and by this stage I was getting itchy feet, desperate for some of the excitement that Hitch routinely injected into most of his other movies.Oh, I appreciate the film's psychology. Its exploration of the nature of obsession is extremely interesting, and Stewart is perfectly situated to play the guy going out of his mind. There are some great set-pieces too, not least the opener which is eye-popping. Stuff, when it happens, is generally good, especially that huge twist which I didn't see coming that takes place around the halfway mark. Novak, as the object of Stewart's affections, puts in a multi-layered performance which impresses from the outset, and the inevitable climax closes things off nicely.Butyeah. Some judicious pruning would, I think, have resulted in a tighter and more gripping film, and as it stands even Hitchcock himself feels bored at some key points. VERTIGO is, I believe, a decent film, but it's far from being the director's best let alone the best film of all time! NB. I recently re-watched this on blu-ray and the presentation in HD is quite stunning. The Herrmann score is excellent and the colours and visuals outstanding - that low-slung shot of Golden Gate Bridge is phenomenal. The film's mood has grown on me and I now feel that this is a good film, albeit still not one of the director's best.",Vertigo
4,SnoopyStyle,"slow 1st half, good obsessive 2nd half",8,29 November 2013,"San Francisco police detective Scottie Ferguson retires after suffering vertigo during a roof top chase. A college friend Gavin Elster is a wealthy shipbuilder who hires him to follow his wife Madeleine (Kim Novak). He thinks she is being possessed. Scottie finds her obsessed with a dead ancestor, and attempting suicide. He rescues her and falls for her.This movie does move a bit too slow especially in the first half. The difficulty lies in all the following in the car. It's not the most exciting thing to drive around. In a modern movie, those scenes would be severely edited down. It's not like they were exciting car chases.It's not my favorite Hitchcock movie. I did like James Stewart when he gets obsessive. He's good in that section. As for being too old for the part, that to me seems to work for him in this movie. His obsession becomes more self-destructive. It has a creepiness to it. I have to admit that I didn't recognize Novak as Judy Barton. It confused me a bit at first. I think people of that era would have an easier time recognizing Kim Novak. As homage to its importance and inventive camera work, I'll add an extra point or else I would have given it 7/10.",Vertigo
5,Hitchcoc,Makes the Brain Spin,10,5 May 1999,"Having experienced vertigo myself, the dizzying, confusing, frightening mind spinning, ""think you're going to die"" kind of feeling, I can empathize with the Jimmie Stewart protagonist.  Make him a hero who has enough hangups from trauma to last a lifetime.  Put into the plot a series of misrepresentations of fact and you have this movie.  I think what I like the most is that we have this man trying to put his life together, but he doesn't know what to do to make it work.  He also is deep in depression, caused by personal loss. Along comes Kim Novak, the carbon copy of his lost love.  He falls into a sick reconstruction of his past life, but the fear is still there and won't go away until he is able to confront his ghosts.  Once again, the Hitchcock hero fumbles his way along, trying to discover while being pursued.  There is that threat there all the time.  The cinematography is excellent.  The method used to show the feeling he gets when he looks down, is pure genius. The framing of scenes. The stairway in the tower. The scenes by the bay. Novak's ""coming out"" is really spooky, so captivating and yet unsettling. The true test of a movie, for me, is always going to be that there is something to see after several viewings.  Hitchcock's films, especially the really good ones, allow me a lifetime of rediscovery; I feel that directors like Hitchcock are a gift to humanity.  This film is one of the reasons I feel this way.",Vertigo
6,boblipton,Here's to Love on Our Own Terms,10,8 January 2006,"I feel a need to tell you a short anecdote about seeing this movie. When it was restored in the late 1990s, the New York premiere took place at the Ziegfeld. I managed to wangle my way in and saw so much in this movie I hadn't seen before, that can't really be seen except on the big screen.... and when I left the theater, I saw couples coming out..... and three or four women slapped the men they were with.Now it seemed to me clear that they felt that they had undergone some of the transformations imposed on the Kim Novak character by the Jimmy Stewart character for the sake of their relationships and bitterly resented it.... but it seemed to me that Stewart was also transformed by the relationship. In fact, he was destroyed by the relationship.... and was his acquiescence at all voluntary? Yet people do not see the sacrifices that others make for love, they only see their own, and they regret them bitterly.... and that, it seems to me, is that what this movie is about: the forces and twists and turns, the ignoring the clear signs, the self destruction at so many levels that love drives us to. This cynical, manipulative movie about absolute love.Three or four big, hairy men slapped by women. And taking it. Who had been dragged unwillingly into a different personality for the sake of love?",Vertigo
7,Prismark10,Heightened tension,7,22 March 2014,"Vertigo is a film whose plot elements have been borrowed many times and has been a huge influence on Brian De Palma.James Stewart is a San Francisco detective Scottie Ferguson who develops a fear of heights during a rooftop chase in the opening scenes of the film.An old college friend Gavin Elster hires him to follow his wife Madeleine (Kim Novak) because she might be possessed by some ancestral spirit. Scottie becomes enchanted, even obsessed by Madeleine who he saves from suicide and falls in love. However later throws herself from a church and he is unable to save her because of his fear of heights, Scottie falls into a deep depression.After he has got better he finds a girl (Judy Barton) who reminds him of Madeleine and he also becomes obsessed with wanting her to look and dress like Madeleine which leads the film to another diversion.The restored version of this film looks gorgeous although it also highlights the backdrop in Stewart's apartment. Novak in dual roles simply shines and the film is intriguing. Barbara Bel Geddes who has a thing for Scottie disappears half way through the film as her role becomes redundant and James Stewart does well as he again looks to become unhinged once he becomes transfixed with Judy Barton.However the film's denouement two thirds way of the film feels unsatisfactory and I can see why Hitchcock was not happy about it. The mystery would had been better resolved at the end of the film.",Vertigo
8,claudio_carvalho,A Masterpiece of Obsession,10,5 December 2009,"While pursuing a criminal on the roofs of the buildings in San Francisco, Detective John ""Scottie"" Ferguson (James Stewart) has a severe trauma when his partner falls off the roof trying to save him. He suffers from acrofobia and is retired from the police force, since his fear of heights provokes vertigo on him. He is contacted by the former mate from college Gavin Elster (Tom Helmore), who runs the shipyard of his wife Madeleine Elster (Kim Novak), and Gavin asks him to follow his wife. Gavin explains that she has an odd behavior and seems to be possessed by the spirit of Carlotta Valdes, having blanks of memory every now and then and presenting suicidal tendencies. The skeptical Scottie follows the beautiful blonde on the next morning: she buys some flowers and is drawn to places from the past related to Carlotta Valdes, visiting her grave in an ancient cemetery; staring her portrait for a long time in a museum; and finally moving to the Hotel McKittrick where Carlotta lived. In the end of the day, Scottie reports his findings to Gavin. When Madeleine jumps in the water of San Francisco Bay, Scottie rescues her and brings her home. He has a crush on her and they fall in love for each other. When they go together to a mission outside San Francisco, Madeleine runs to the bell tower of the church and the disabled Scottie is unable to reach her; she jumps off the tower, committing suicide. There is a trial and the traumatized Scottie is interned with a breakdown. When he is discharged from the hospital, he meets the brunet seller Judy Barton by chance and her resemblance with Madeleine is amazing. Scottie approaches to Judy and expect to have a second chance in love until he sees a souvenir of a killing. ""Vertigo"" is a masterpiece of obsession of Alfred Hitchcock. The timeless complex story is perfect and full of suspense and psychological and sexual tensions. Kim Novak is extremely sexy and has an extraordinary performance in her double role and James Stewart is awesome as usual performing a charismatic character that becomes obsessed when he sees Judy. Barbara Bel Geddes performs an important support character that helps to develop James Stewart's character. The open conclusion is also excellent and the music score is also spectacular and gives a suspenseful touch of class to this film. This time, the cameo of Alfred Hitchcock is walking in front of the entrance of the shipyard carrying what seems to be a musical instrument. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): ""Um Corpo que Cai"" (""A Body that Falls"")",Vertigo
9,kosmasp,Miss Leading,9,8 May 2020,"Quite a few famous things happen here. One of them being the shot - zoom doing the opposite of the camera movement and therefor giving us quite a dizzy sequence. We start with a chase and ... well we never get a full resolve of that chase. It just sets up something - which also sets up that it sets up how the story is being told.This may sound complicated and maybe you dissaprove of how Hitchcock went on to make this movie (especially contrasting the first half of the film to the latter part of it) - but if you can dig it, if you can get behind it, you will enjoy this very crazy ride into human insanity, madness and obsesiveness. How and what would a happy ending be? And for whom would that resolve anything? Hitchcock is not always giving us all the answers we may crave for - but he knows what boxes to tick to keep us on the edge of the seat.",Vertigo
10,classicsoncall,"""Somewhere in here I was born... and there I died"".",8,20 September 2009,"""Vertigo"" is the cleverest of Alfred Hitchcock's murder mysteries, and it's probably one of the cleverest thrillers of all time. But what I find with Hitchcock is that with some thoughtful consideration after the fact, there are usually some annoying little details that the Master himself never fully deals with. What intrigued me the most about the story was that Gavin Elster (Tom Helmore) put Scottie Ferguson (James Stewart) on the trail of a phony Mrs. Elster right from the very start. So we never even get to see the REAL Mrs. Elster. Which is OK as far as that goes, but doesn't it strike you as curious that Mrs. Elster would never think about using the car when 'Madeleine' was out and about tooling around San Francisco leading Scottie on his mission?Then there's 'Judy' putting on the Carlotta Valdez necklace to go out on a date with Scottie - holy smokes! - where were the alarm bells on that one? You mean to tell me Judy couldn't make that connection? Actually, it wouldn't have been the first time a piece of jewelry helped identify a murderer, but it was done with a bit more finesse in 1945's ""Conflict"", with Humphrey Bogart being tripped up by a stickpin brooch.Finally, I have some trouble with the final scene where Judy 'accidentally' falls to her death. It's just too convenient an ending, much like Uncle Charlie's demise at the end of another Hitchcock thriller from 1943, ""Shadow Of A Doubt"". Just how did Judy manage to fall off the the bell tower landing when Scottie himself needed three steps to get to the edge?Aside from all that though, the story is a compelling one and does convey an air of intrigue and mystery, especially in the early going when the viewer rides along with Scottie following the intricate deception that Madeleine lays out. It's too bad Scottie didn't take Midge (Barbara Bel Geddes) along for the ride, she might have been able to smoke out the whole ruse.If I'm being too nit-picky about the film, it's because Hitchcock has this reputation as one of the all time great directors, yet a lot of the story doesn't ring true under close inspection. I've found the same to be the case for some of his other pictures, like ""Strangers On A Train"", ""Rope"", and the earlier referenced ""Shadow Of a Doubt"". But to be fair, he also had some thrillers that were exceptional, namely ""Dial M For Murder"" and ""North By Northwest"".One last thought, and this one bothered me throughout the whole picture - how was Scottie rescued from the ledge in the opening scene?",Vertigo
11,lee_eisenberg,don't look down,9,11 June 2005,"You understand ""Vertigo"" better once you know the word's definition. It refers specifically to dizziness, not acrophobia as some people mistakenly believe. Dizziness plays a major role in the movie. Jimmy Stewart plays San Francisco Det. John ""Scottie"" Ferguson, who gets uncomfortable in high places. Hired to follow Madeleine Elster (Kim Novak), he rescues her from drowning. As he stays with her more and more, he begins to suspect something strange about her. It all comes to a head at the San Juan Bautista Mission, when she jumps off of the bell tower. Scottie feels guilty, but some questions remain unanswered. Just who is that woman whom Scottie sees in the museum? Why does she look exactly like Madeleine? And how does a Spanish woman who lived almost 100 years earlier relate to all this? The spirals are an eye-opening aspect. Not only the opening credits, but also Scottie's acrophobia, and the staircase in the bell tower. As is often the case in Alfred Hitchcock's movies, the lighting tells part of the story; in this case, a sign outside the apartment illuminates Madeleine and her dress.The San Juan Bautista Mission is not an accident. Hitchcock was raised Roman Catholic, so it makes sense that he might want to use such an institution. But the movie's final scene - which happens at the Mission - seems to be a metaphor for things coming back to haunt people.And of course, Kim Novak was one of Hitchcock's ""icy blondes"", in the same category as Grace Kelly, Doris Day, Eva Marie Saint, Janet Leigh and Tippi Hedren. All I can tell you further is that there is a scene in which Madeleine is next to a window, and you see her reflection; that appears to be foreshadowing.All very vertiginous.",Vertigo
12,jboothmillard,Vertigo,10,4 September 2008,"This is meant to be one of the great films directed by Sir Alfred Hitchcock, after Psycho of course. James Stewart plays Detective John 'Scottie' Ferguson, he used to be a cop until he discovered his fear of heights, acrophobia which gives him Vertigo. He has tried to get rid of this fear but he can't. He is asked by Gavin Elster (Tom Helmore) to keep an eye on his mysterious wife, Madeleine (Kim Novak). As he gets to know her, he sees resemblance to a woman from the past in a painting she stares at. He also falls in love with her, but their romance is cut short when Mr. Elster makes John believe that Madeleine committed suicide. After a little while, he sees a woman that bares a very close resemblance to Madeleine, Judy Barton (Novak, of course). He becomes very obsessive turning Judy into Madeleine, he moves quite far from his Mr. Nice Guy image. A very imaginative story that will chill and touch. Hitchcock's cameo is a man that walks past in a grey suit carrying a small trumpet. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration and Best Sound. Sir Alfred Hitchcock was number 75 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons, James Stewart was number 12 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, he was number 3 on 100 Years, 100 Stars - Men, and he was number 13 on The World's Greatest Actor, the film was number 12 on 100 Years of Film Scores, it was number 18 on 100 Years, 100 Thrills, it was number 18 on 100 Years, 100 Passions, it was number 61 on 100 Years, 100 Movies and it was number 29 on The 100 Greatest Films.

13,ccthemovieman-1,This Has To Be One Of The Most Overrated Films In History,5,8 September 2006,"I think I made more of an effort to try to really like this movie than any film I can think of....and I finally have given up. There is something just unappealing about this story. I know two things: 1 - It's vastly overrated; 2 - It's too slow.Jimmy Stewart is fine in the lead role. That's no surprise. But his character is anything but fine, having an affair with a married woman (which never portrayed wrong by Hitchcock) and doing a few other things that left the viewers scratching their heads in credulity. ""How could he be doing this if....? ""Wait, that doesn't make sense,"" etc. were just some of the comments I've heard from people watching this film.Yet, despite the credibility this films holds a big fascination for a lot of people. I gave it several looks just to see if I wasn't missing something, that the story would become more attractive as I became more familiar with it. Well, it did piece a few things together but the movie never got appealing.The only attractive part was actress Kim Novak and the cinematography, especially the scenes under the Golden Gate Bridge. That, and the fact I always enjoy seeing Barbara Bel Geddes. I was sorry her role was so short in here.Overall, I still don't see what the fuss is about concerning this movie. The story leaves me as cold as the San Francisco fog.",Vertigo
14,rmax304823,Only the most shallow man would fail to be impressed by appearances.,8,12 October 2008,"""Vertigo"" is considered Hitchcock's masterpiece by high-brows and viewed as a slow, dull movie by proletarians. Indulge this Olympian generalizations for a moment. If you don't know the story by now, it goes something like this. Jimmy Stewart is a San Francisco detective retired from the force because he contracted a severe case of acrophobia on the job. An old college friend, Gavin Elster, hires him to follow Elster's wife, Madeleine (Kim Novak) around. Elster is afraid Madeleine is going nuts. Stewart takes the job and is soon hooked on the lovely Madeleine. He rescues her from a suicide attempt, lugs her unconscious body to his own apartment, undresses her, and puts her in his bed until she recovers. Stewart and Madeleine fall in love, but she's still balmy and climbs to the tower of an old church to kill herself. Stewart can't follow because of his acrophobia. He blames himself. Later, while wandering the city streets, he spots a girl named Judy Barton (also Kim Novak) who resembles the departed Madeleine. Stewart gets to know her, squires her around, and step-by-step has her dress and groom herself exactly like his lost love. Then he discovers that Judy IS in fact his lost love. Judy was in cahoots with Gavin Elster and Stewart was a victim of a hoax designed to get rid of Elster's real wife. It ends tragically.It's neither a masterpiece nor dull, really. I don't doubt for a minute that it's Hitchcock's most personal movie. Cripes, he's got this luscious blond he keeps dressing and undressing, gorgeous and sexy, but also unattainable and ghostly. (A ghost of substantial heft, though.) That was always Hitchcock's fantasy, the icy Nordic who would attack you in the back seat of a taxi. (Poor Alma Reville, his wife, a rather homely brunette dwarf.) On top of the personal interest that Hitchcock lavished on the story, he adds some technical dazzle. Not too much. The acrophobic detective stares down the tall campanile and the camera simultaneously zooms in and dollies back. The tactic was so successful it's been imitated a number of times. And when Stewart and Novak finally kiss and make love in her green-lighted apartment, the director has them and the camera on a turntable that slowly revolves and shows us varied haunting backdrops. And the movie wouldn't be what it is without Bernard Hermann's romantic and oneiristic score.The whole film is meant to be dream-like and that's why it's understandable that some people would see it as irritatingly slow. It follows Edgar Allan Poe's theory of literary aesthetics. Poe threw reason off the bell tower and went for eerie effects, period. A man buries a murder victim under the floor but nails a cat in with the body by mistake. How can anyone miss a cat that's in the burial chamber? I can imagine viewers now, squirming, and asking, ""Where the hell is the logic in this movie?"" Let's put it this way. You are a girl named Judy Barton. You're pretty but have no marketable skills. A very wealthy man comes to you and offers you money to help him kill his wife. All you have to do is impersonate the wife and trap a former detective named Jimmy Stewart into falling in love with you and then lead him to a place where the wife can be safely killed and still look like suicide.Then, after the rich dude takes off for Europe, leaving you to become your slovenly self, you accidentally run into the victimized Stewart on the streets. (In a city of 700,000.) He doesn't recognize you, naturally, because now, having reverted to your original persona, you look like an overly made-up hooker. But he follows you home, knocks on your door, introduces himself, and asks you for a date. I ask you -- the discerning, sophisticated, somewhat street-savvy viewer -- would you accept? Would you date a man who will almost inevitably find out you're a murderess? One slip of the tongue could do it. The only person stupid enough to accept would also bury a black cat alongside a dead body.Kim Novak is a lot more effective as Madeleine than as Judy. The latter persona is coarse but tender too. The former is elegant and speaks in a ghostly whisper. Kim Novak was probably right for the part. As Judy, she has these overemphatic eyebrows that lend her the appearance of a Universal monster, perhaps one of the lesbian vampires that smiles as she pours you the drugged wine. But of Hitchcock's other actresses at the time, who else could have done better? The photography is splendid. And the director takes us on a Cook's Tour of many of the Bay Area landmarks -- Ernie's restaurant (now gone), Muir Woods almost, The Palace of the Legion of Honor, Fort Point, Mission San Juan Bautista (which has no tower), Point Lobos. And every day is perfectly sunny. Stewart re-dresses Novak at an expensive shop that was Ransohoff's at the time. It, too, is now gone but I took my wife to its less expensive replacement and insisted she buy a signature gray suit with a soft white shirt and a pair of brown heels. She swore she would do no such thing. After a slight scuffle, not nearly as athletic as the papers made it out to be, we wound up with some cheap scrap of an apron. (She never wore it.) It's only in a film in which there is no place for common sense, let alone genuine logic, that a man can create a new woman or resurrect an old one.I find it a fascinating movie, technically almost perfect, and worth repeated viewings if they're not repeated too often. (It's pretty depressing.) It's at once demanding and rewarding. And I'm certainly glad Hitchcock made it, if only to get it out of his system.",Vertigo
15,Tweekums,Another masterpiece from Hitchcock,10,2 August 2012,"As the film opens we see a rooftop chase taking place high above the streets of San Francisco; a policeman slips and is left hanging from a gutter; another policeman goes to help him but he slips and falls to his death. The man hanging from the gutter is John 'Scottie' Ferguson and after the events that day he is plagued by acrophobia which causes an intense sense of vertigo whenever he looks down from a height. With this condition he doesn't feel able to continue working in the police but is soon being asked to work in a private capacity for an old college friend. He believes his wife, Madeleine, is being possessed by one of her ancestors who committed suicide at her age; he asks John to follow her and it soon becomes apparent that something strange is going on. She visits a gave then goes to an art gallery where she looks at a portrait of the woman whose grave she visited; she then continues to a hotel where she is registered under that woman's name! The plot continues to thicken when he sees her jump into the bay; he rescues her but when she comes to she has no recollection of the events. She gets to know him and talks of a strange dream; he believes she is dreaming of a real place she once visited and from her description he knows just where it is. They head there hoping to break the dream but the trip ends in tragedy when she apparently jumps from the church tower as he is powerless to help her because of his acrophobia. This disturbs him and he has a breakdown; until one day he finds a woman that looks very similar to Madeleine.This Alfred Hitchcock film is a real classic featuring a great performance from the always reliable James Stewart as Ferguson and solid support from Kim Novak as Madeleine and Barbara Bel Geddes as his friend Midge. The story had me gripped from start to finish as I tried to figure out just what was going on with Madeleine. After the incident in the tower it was just as interesting to watch Ferguson's obsession grow as he tries to get the look-alike to change her appearance so she'd look even more like Madeleine. Hitchcock made the most of the San Francisco location without it feeling like he was using the shot just to show off the famous landmarks that appeared; he also used some interesting techniques to emphasise Ferguson's sense of vertigo and his growing obsession. If you are a fan of film this one really is a must see; it is a gripping story told in an original way.",Vertigo

17,BA_Harrison,I love Hitchcock but...,5,26 September 2013,"Although often regarded as one of Hitchcock's finest thrillers, Vertigo failed to impress me as much as I had hoped. There are the expected Hitchcock visual flourishes (plus one really trippy scene that is downright freaky), the dreamlike score by Bernard Hermann is suitably eerie, and Barbara Bel Geddes plays a fun character, but most other aspects of this so-called classic left me cold.James Stewart is rather wooden in his role but is suitably matched by Kim Novak, whose pencilled eyebrows have more screen presence than the rest of her (not surprising given how huge they are!); Hitch must have been directing on Valium, such is the slowness of the pace; and the story is really mundane, with little in the way of excitement or suspense save for the opening rooftop chase scene. Quite what other Hitchcock fans are raving about when they claim this is amongst his best work is beyond me—I struggled to stay awake.",Vertigo
18,moonspinner55,From among the dead...,9,7 September 2005,"Alfred Hitchcock's ""Vertigo"" has a narcotizing effect, a lulling, dream-like ambiance that is hard to shake off, which may explain why many viewers keep returning to it. It's also a strangely muted and anticlimactic film, posing yet another possible reason moviegoers watch it repeatedly: they hope (or need) to get more out of it the third or fourth time. Retired police detective James Stewart meets and makes over a woman who reminds him of his only true love--a suicidal woman he lost, but perhaps can find again by dipping back into the past. Hitchcock seemed to relate to Stewart's ""Scottie"" moreso than any other character in his films, and--having a gleeful touch of nastiness himself--is careful not to let him have his way. Glamour-mystery is gorgeous to take in, fascinatingly written and well-acted. Only one question: is the hotel manager (Ellen Corby) part of the scheme or just a dotty old broad? ***1/2 from ****",Vertigo
19,dbdumonteil,Among the very best.,10,12 August 2001,"In Boileau-Narcejac's French novel ""D'Entre les Morts""= from among the Dead""),the revelation only comes in the last pages,but Hitchcock lets the cat out of the bag long before the end. Boileau-Narcejac's novel is a pure detective story,but the Master wanted more:the movie already outdistances the book in a first part visually wonderful,with memorable scenes,wrapped in mystery ,such as the one with the sequoia,symbol of immortality or the one down by the sea,to rival with the best romantic movies of all time.In the second part,Hitchcock explains in the Truffaut's book,we know but Scottie( James Stewart) does not .And he tries to recreate a dead woman,to transform Judy into Madeleine.This folie à deux ends where the first tragedy occurred ,which gives the movie a strength that the book had not.Read it and you'll realize how its end ,speaking in terms of cinema,had to be modified for the screen.That's Hitchcock's genius.When Boileau/Narcejac learned that Hitchcock wanted to transfer ""Celle Qui N'Etait PLus "" (=les Diaboliques"" )to the screen,they immediately wrote ""D'Entre les Morts "" on the same pattern for Hitchcock to direct.",Vertigo
20,Quinoa1984,"Favorite Hitchcock and likely one of the most challenging, harrowing great films ever",10,13 February 2000,"Alfred Hitchcock's Vertigo is probably his most discussed film, and I believe that since it is so controversial- and yet living up to such hype by having a level of mystery, daring and true human interest that is open to interpretation- it gets better with every passing year. It deserves more credit than it gets (like most of Hitchcock's films) and though it is well credited with it's intrigue, I think that Psycho (not that it is a bad film) gets more credit than this film should get. There are at least a few reasons for this, arguably of course. One, the acting is spectacular including James Stewart in one of his very best turns as the weary, emotionally perplexed and obsessed cop with a slight fear of heights and a 'thing' for a certain 'dead' woman. Hitchcock's leading lady here Kim Novak, is equally interesting and ambiguous as the leading lady (or ladies). Two, the atmosphere Hicthcock invokes in this film is just right for the psychological tailspin that Stewart gets into, with the usage of lighting, real San Fransisco locations, and particularly the color green all to perfect, eerie effect. And three, there's Bernard Herrmann's score, on par with the Psycho score though maybe even better as a straight piece of classical music in the guise of tense, haunting movie music. It's also the kind of picture that is a MUST if you've already seen it, or even if not, and it comes around town on the big screen as all the images and dark scenes come into great view. Not one of the more outright 'fun' Hitchcock films, with the few chuckles plain comic relief, and maybe his best serious work. A++",Vertigo
21,JohnHowardReid,A masterpiece of nightmarish excitement!,10,1 March 2018,"At the time of Vertigo's release, very few critics commented upon Bernard Herrmann's powerful music score which contributes so greatly to the movie's overall mood, atmosphere and almost unnerving suspense. The stars also were not given their due. In the most emotionally complex and technically demanding role of his career, James Stewart is totally convincing. He looks and acts like a man obsessed, a readily identifiable hero battling with age and infirmity to recreate an impossible, lost love. Stewart is not only utterly credible, but engrossingly sympathetic. On the other hand, Kim Novak (in by far the best performance of her career - she replaced Hitch's first choice, Vera Miles, at short notice when Vera became pregnant) combines a brassily self-confident manner with an odd aura of vulnerability. She is exactly the lost child of Stewart's obsessive dreams.",Vertigo
22,sunwarrior13,Vertigo Is A Masterpiece And Hitchcock Is A Genius,10,31 October 2011,"Vertigo is a psychological thriller film by Alfred Hitchcock.It is about a story of a retired police detective suffering from vertigo who is hired as a private investigator to follow the wife of an acquaintance to uncover the mystery of her peculiar behavior.It features James Stewart, Kim Novak, and Barbara Bel Geddes. The screenplay was written by Alec Coppel and Samuel A. Taylor that was based on the novel entitled,""D'entre les morts"" written by Boileau-Narcejac.The movie weaves an intricate web of obsession and deceit.It opens as Scottie Ferguson realizes he has vertigo,a condition resulting in a fear of heights, when a police officer is killed trying to rescue him from falling off a building. Scottie then retires from his position as a private investigator, only to be lured into another case by his old college friend, Gavin Elster. Elster's wife, Madeleine, has been possessed by a spirit, and Elster wants Scottie to follow her. He hesitantly agrees, and thus begins the film's wordless montage as Scottie follows the beautiful yet enigmatic Madeleine through 1950s San Francisco. After saving her from suicide, Scottie begins to fall in love with her, and she appears to feel the same way. Here tragedy strikes, and each twist in the movie's second half changes our preconceptions about the characters and events. The movie is definitely a masterpiece.It involves the viewer deeply into it especially with themes of erotic obsession.Also,Alfred Hitchcock's twisty,suspenseful and tension-filled tale is far involving and engaging that one may get absorbed into the story and the characters involved.This only proves he is genius in his craft and film making.And most of all,it has one unpredictable story that one can't see far before the final credits roll. The performances of the talented cast are definitely excellent and outstanding.Added to that,the musical score was written by Bernard Herrmann provides a haunting theme that elevates the drama way above the level of an already great masterpiece.Overall,Vertigo creates a cinema landmark of excellence that only the likes of The Godfather can probably match or surpass.",Vertigo

24,hitchcockthelegend,You're not lost. Mother's here.,10,19 July 2009,"John ""Scottie"" Ferguson is a San Francisco cop who decides to quit the service after his acrophobia results in him being unable to save the life of a colleague. Whilst taking it easy he gets a call from an old school friend, Gavin Elster, asking him if he wouldn't mind doing a little bit of detective work for him. The job is simply to tail his wife because she's obsessed with an ancestress who committed suicide, and the wife, Madeline, is showing signs of herself being suicidal. Ferguson tails her diligently and as the tail progresses, Ferguson himself starts to become ever obsessed about the demur blonde Madeline. As the story twists and turns, Ferguson's obsession will have far reaching consequences for both parties... Vertigo is Alfred Hitchcock's most discussed, dissected and critically reappraised film, based on a novel by Pierre Boileau called D'Entre Les Morts, (also writer of Diabolique), Vertigo was not well liked on its release and unable to be viewed for some time due to copyright, the film was restored from a destroyed negative into a glorious 70mm print, and now in all its glory it can be seen as one of the greatest films to have ever been made. What is most striking about Vertigo, outside of Hitchcock baring his innermost that is, is that its plot on the surface is simplicity personified, but delving deeper, and repeat viewings are a necessity, its apparent that Vertigo is a chilling force of cinema, taking great delight in gnawing away at your perceptions, perhaps even your own capabilities as a human being. Very much a film of two great halves, Vertigo first seems intent on being an almost ghost story like mystery. Once the prologue has introduced us to Ferguson's fear of heights, we then enter an almost dream like sequence of events as Ferguson tails the troubled Madeline, the suggestion of reincarnation bleakly leading to death hangs heavy as Hitchcock pulls his atmospheric strings. Then the film shifts into dark territory as obsessions and nods to Dante's Inferno and feverish dreams take control, Hitchcock, as we have come to learn over the years, lays out his soul for us the audience to partake in, the uneasy traits sitting side by side with fascination of the story. All of which is leading us to a spine tingling finale that is as hauntingly memorable as it is shocking, the end to our own dizzying journey that Alfred and his team have taken us on. Technically the film is magnificent, the opening credits from Saul Bass brilliantly prep us for what is about to unfold, while Bernard Herrmann's score is as good as anything he ever did, unnerving one minute, swirlingly romantic the next, a truly incredible score. Hitchcock himself is firing from the top draw, introducing us to the brilliant zoom-forward-track-back camera technique to induce the feeling of Vertigo itself, with that merely a component of two hours of gorgeous texture lined with disturbing little peccadilloes. The two leads are arguably doing their respective career best work, James Stewart as Scottie Ferguson goes real deep to play it out with an edgy believability that decries his aw-shucks trademark of years since past. Kim Novak as Madeline is perhaps the quintessential Hitchcock blonde, perfect with the duality aspects of the role and playing off Stewart's ever creepy descent with seamlessly adroit skill. It however should be noted that Hitchcock and his loyal subjects had to work hard to get Novak right for the role, but the result proves that Novak had ability that sadly wasn't harnessed on too many other occasions. Vertigo is a film that I myself wasn't too taken with on my first viewing, it's only during revisits that the piece has come to grab me by the soul and refuse to let go, it not only holds up on revisits, it also gets better with each subsequent viewing, it is simply a film that demands to be seen as many times as possible. Not only one of the greatest American films ever made, one of the greatest films ever made...period, so invest your soul in it, just the way that Hitchcock himself so clearly did. 10/10",Vertigo
25,Hey_Sweden,Hitch works wonders with this material.,9,16 November 2015,"This tantalizing, intense, dreamy thriller is considered by some to be Alfred Hitchcocks' finest hour. It moves slowly, but at the same time it's absolutely hypnotic. Helped to a great extent by one of Bernard Herrmanns' best scores, Hitch and his excellent cast pull you right in and take you on a memorable journey. It's simply one of the best studies in obsession that this viewer has seen in a motion picture. Hitch begins the tale in high style, creating a LOT of potent atmosphere and a touching romance. His visuals are among his most innovative, with an incredible nightmare sequence devised by John Ferren.James Stewart is very likable as John ""Scottie"" Ferguson, a police detective who has a traumatic experience after which he realizes that he's deathly afraid of heights. While recuperating, he meets up with an old school chum, Gavin Elster (Tom Helmore). Gavin is worried about the mental state and behaviour of his young wife Madeleine (Kim Novak), and hires Scottie to shadow her and see what she gets up to. Scottie falls in love with the beautiful blonde, and becomes determined to help her face whatever demons are haunting her.""Vertigo"" is one of those stories that works better the less the prospective viewer knows about the plot, so this viewer will refrain from rehashing any more of it. Suffice it to say, this devastating entertainment comes up with some pretty sharp twists and turns. The character of Scottie completely earns ones' sympathies, from beginning to end.Novak seems awfully aloof for a while, but while this story plays out, her performance starts looking better and better. Barbara Bel Geddes leads a strong supporting cast (Henry Jones, Raymond Bailey, Ellen Corby, Konstantin Shayne, Lee Patrick, Paul Bryar) as she plays the role of Midge, Scotties' loyal companion who still carries a torch for him.I've heard it said that ""Vertigo"" only gets better with subsequent viewings, so I'm already looking forward to revisiting at some point in the future.Nine out of 10.",Vertigo

27,CinemaSerf,Hitch without a hitch...,8,27 May 2020,"When folks talk about pace nowadays, we normally refer to speed - it has a direct correlation to action; or dialogue - or both. This is one of the best examples of pace I've ever seen - and it has nothing to do with either. It is about suspense, about letting your imagination become grafted onto a character that almost enables you to feel their pain and anguish whilst safely ensconced in your armchair. Jimmy Stewart is cracking as a retired policeman (""Scottie""), with vertigo, who is asked by old friend Tom Helmore to basically keep an eye on his wife Kim Novak whom he thinks might be a suicide risk. He reluctantly accepts the task, and in soon being drawn into a wonderfully enigmatic story that results in the inevitable... or does it...? Right until the end of this masterful drama, we are unsure as to what we have actually seen! That's what makes this film so great - it lures us in without us really comprehending - just as it ensnares Stewart. Bernard Herrmann's score is lethal in this respect; loads of strong themes with quite a few faux-crescendos building the tension magnificenty, and Barbara Bel Geddes serves efficiently as the alkali to the acidity elsewhere.

28,writers_reign,Falling In Love Again,6,14 July 2008,"It's a proved fact that if something is repeated enough times the susceptible person will eventually accept it as fact. Not everyone is susceptible to manipulation and so it is that I find myself at odds with two things that I have heard - and seen on the printed page - repeated for most of my life, 1) Alfred Hitchcock is a 'master' and 2)Vertigo is a classic. So far as the first statement goes I've watched enough of Hitchcock's films to judge him a reasonably competent filmmaker but certainly no more gifted than, say, Howard Hawks, George Cukor, Henry Hathaway etc. On the other hand I have no problem accepting that Billy Wilder and Orson Welles are both 'masters'. I've now seen Vertigo twice over a period of five or six years and I still can't see what all the fuss is about. For one thing it's riddled with flaws. Hitchcock needs to establish that James Steward has a problem with heights so he has Stewart, a plain-clothes detective working out of Frisco, and a uniformed cop, chase a suspect across some rooftops. The suspect leaps between two buildings, the uniformed cop follows, Stewart is last and fails to gain a foothold on the adjacent roof; he slips down the mansard roof and is left clinging to a gutter that is giving under his weight; the uniform cop abandons the chase, allowing the suspect to get away, and attempts to haul Stewart up to safety but falls to his own death. Stewart is now hanging from a rapidly weakening gutter with no hand or footholds available and not a soul to help. Clearly in 30 seconds, 60 tops, he is bound to fall to his own death. Clearly we can't have this so Hitch just cuts the scene and Fades In several months later when we discover Stewart in the apartment of a friend, Barbara Bel Geddes, complete with cane and corset and now, he tells Geddes (us the viewer) retired from the police force. He's then contacted by an acquaintance he hasn't seen since college who has since married into money and is running a large family business on behalf of his wife. He interviews Stewart in his large, well-appointed office and voices his concerns about his wife's strange behaviour, asking Stewart, as a favor, to follow her. I don't know about you but I have been in the offices of several successful businessmen and in 99 per cent of cases their offices boast a picture of their wives and/or children if they are married. Not this kiddie. He tells Stewart he will be dining with his wife later that evening and suggests Stewart be in the restaurant to get a look at his wife. Detective Stewart never thinks to ascertain that it IS his wife or to see a picture or any kind of proof that the woman in the restaurant, Kim Novak, really is the guy's wife. For a society woman Novak cannot come up with one single friend and spends her days totally alone and seemingly obsessed with a long-dead relative. Stewart follows her to a hotel, sees her at the window of her room there, braces the owner, who takes him up to what is now an empty room. Again no explanation of how or where she disappeared to. Eventually Stewart falls for her, she insists on visiting a mission outside Frisco, climbs the bell tower and seemingly Brodies. Verdict: Accidental death. Some months later Stewart sees her 'double' in the street and falls in love all over again. At this point Hitchcock makes us privvy to the scam. When she led him to the bell-tower the guy who hired Stewart was waiting at the top where he threw his REAL wife off the edge. He had merely hired Novak to pose as his wife (she did something similar in Wilder's Kiss Me, Stupid, when she posed as the wife of Ray Walston). Here we encounter the second 'problem'. A woman goes off a bell tower and soon the place is crawling with cops so how come no one noticed a man and a woman, one the husband of the dead woman the other his supposed wife, sneaking away. If you can buy these pathetic plot points then chances are you will think this is something more than a competent meller.

31,Boba_Fett1138,One of my favorite Hitchcock movies to watch.,9,15 October 2010,"It's amazing what a nose and eye Hitchcock had for a great story. Throughout the decades he had always picked up some great scripts or bought the rights from some great novels.There probably is no other Hitchcock movie than this one, that I've seen more often. It's simply because this is such a fine and pleasant one to watch. It's definitely one of my favorite Hitchcock movies, though let it be noted that favorite is something totally different than best.You don't have to be a big Hitchcock enthusiast to appreciate this movie. You don't have to be familiar with any of his visual style or way of storytelling to get sucked in by this movie. It's therefore a perfectly accessible and also timeless movie to watch, for basically just about everybody. So don't let anything hold you back from watching this movie.Foremost reason why this is such a fine quality movie to watch is due to its very well written story. It's a mystery, it's a thriller and it's a romantic movie, all in one. It means that the story is often going at different places, which in return provides the movie with a very fast and pleasant pace. The movie keeps changing its style and approach often with its story and characters. It throws in a couple of nice twists, that obviously work out most effectively the first time you watch this movie and have no idea where the movie is heading to. My only complaint is that the second half of this movie just isn't as good and interesting as its first. It didn't made the best choices with its characters and story in my opinion, which also goes a bit at the expense of the movie its credibility. It's also less entertaining, since it picks a more serious and dramatic approach. But obviously it's nothing too horrible and actually is all still quite good, or else I wouldn't had rated this movie as highly.Visually and technically this also really is one superior movie. The movie got done really well in its build up and just its overall execution in general. It's actually amazing to see the amount of special effects shots in this movie, some more obvious than others. Added to this gets the fine musical score by Bernard Herrmann and you have one fine unique movie, in terms of its style and approach. The years were already starting to count for James Stewart in this movie. It would also be the least movie he and Alfred Hitchcock made together. It was one fine and successful collaboration between the two and they made four together throughout their careers. There is really not one Hitchcock/Stewart movie that I found nothing short of great. So credit also still needs to go to James Stewart and his performance in this movie. And I don't know what Hitchcock's beef was with Kim Novak but in my opinion she is one of the best leading ladies an Hitchcock movie ever had. She really gave away one fine performance, especially when considering her still quite young age at the time.Really one of my favorite Hitchcock movies to watch, with a more than great story and also one of his movies that is simply timeless and not as much a product of its time, as some of his other movies.9/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Vertigo
32,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,"Where are you now, Madeleine?",10,3 July 2010,"This was one of the first films I watched that made an impression on me. I doubt that I was even a teenager when, one evening, this was on TV. It had me compelled throughout, and the conclusion, well, perfection itself. Needless to say, I did not sleep well that night. I'm now 23, and I finally got a copy of it. As Leonard Maltin put it, this demands multiple viewings; there is too much to take in all at once. This is a psychological thriller about love and obsession. Hitchcock delivers a layered and personal picture(and what may be his best, this or Psycho), and not only do we find ourselves wondering and following this intently, we become as ensnared as Scottie and Alfred. We can neither entirely distance ourselves from it nor condone it. Novak truly is *stunning*, and her performance is very good. Yes, there is an age difference, but they are great together. It is an unusual role for Stewart; this increases the effect, and he is rather convincing. There is suspense(he definitely was the master) and tension right from the opening credits(!). The lighting and sets are amazing, and there are several unforgettable visuals, if the editing and cinematography of this isn't overall as memorable as others by the same director. Dialog is clever, well-delivered and funny when it means to be. The score is powerful, with a little supernatural touch to it, for self-explanatory reasons. Pace is gradual. The plot is well-written, if it doesn't hold up to close scrutiny; this is about the select few characters. There is a bit of disturbing content in this. The DVD comes with an informational commentary track(that goes back and forth, it is ""assembled"" from different people talking about it. Among them is a producer from back then and two people who restored the movie, and they talk about every aspect of it), a featurette that I will review on its own individual page here on the site and two trailers, totalling at 3 and a half minutes, that spoil some of this.

34,evanston_dad,"Accomplished If Not ""Fun"" Hitchcock Drama",9,12 September 2006,"Considered by many to be Hitchcock's masterpiece, ""Vertigo"" may be tough to warm up to on a first viewing. It's an enigmatic and extremely slow-moving film, and it feels personal in ways that many of Hitchcock's other, more playful movies don't. You get the sense that Hitch is working through his personal demons on screen -- the fetishes and obsessions that played such a major role in so many of his films leading up to ""Vertigo"" feel like characters in and of themselves here.James Stewart delivers a frightening performance as a man who plunges into a world of weird sexual obsession when a woman with whom he's formed a romantic attachment dies (or seems to). He finds another woman who looks amazingly like the first, and proceeds to force a complete physical makeover on her in an attempt to recreate his former love. Kim Novak plays the two women in her typical icy fashion; for once, her stilted, awkward acting works for a role and comes off as an attribute rather than a liability.In its new remastered life on DVD, ""Vertigo"" looks stunning. San Francisco and its surroundings are bathed in ethereal, dream-like lighting, and Hitchcock pays more attention to art direction and the use of color than he ever had previously. Also, there's that amazing swirling Bernard Herrmann score that haunts the film, and accompanies one of the most memorable opening credits sequences ever filmed.There are still a number of other Hitchcock films I would rather watch before ""Vertigo,"" and many others that I would qualify as much more fun, but I can't deny that this one certainly has an allure.Grade: A",Vertigo
35,AlsExGal,This film takes repeated viewings to really appreciate it...,10,21 November 2009,"... and perhaps that is why it bombed upon initial release.When Vertigo was first released in 1957, it was not that popular in theaters and was pretty much universally panned by critics. In 1992, when the British Film Institute performed a survey of the world film critics to compile an all-time ten-best list that comes out every decade, Vertigo came in at fourth place. It didn't even make that list in 1962 or 1972. Part of the reason for the delayed popularity of the film could be that it requires repeated viewings to really gain an appreciation of it. Such repeated viewings were not possible for most viewers until the advent of home video systems and cable around 1980.It is unusual to see a director produce his best work after the age of 50, but that is exactly what Alfred Hitchcock did. Starting in 1948 with ""Rope"" and ending with ""The Birds"" in 1963, this was the era of his most inspired films. ""Vertigo"", in my opinion, is the best film of his entire body of work.As for the film itself, it is a brilliantly twisted movie infused with touches of genius and madness that focuses on the interconnected nature of love and obsession. Interwoven with this main theme is a crime mystery that is revealed to and solved for the audience but not the protagonist, James Stewart's character, for the last 45 minutes of the film.Alongside these themes is the issue of lost opportunities - how we grieve over them, and whether or not what we perceive as lost opportunities were ever ""real"" opportunities in the first place. This issue is raised not only for Scotty (James Stewart), but for just about everybody else in the cast too. This includes Scotty's college girlfriend (Barbara Bel Geddes) who has remained his friend through the years and obviously still harbors thoughts of what might have been if only she had accepted Scotty's marriage proposal years before.Besides the excellent acting and superb plot, the score is outstanding as is the cinematography, especially the visual darkness of the mission San Juan Bautista versus the angelic beauty of Madeleine which belies what is really going on. I highly recommend this film to anyone who has the time to watch it more than once. Just one viewing won't do it justice.",Vertigo
36,morrison-dylan-fan,A film that reaches the heights that others can only dream of.,10,9 February 2011,"Since viewing Hitchcocks sadly over looked excellent film Young and Inercent eight years ago,he has always been a director that I have had a huge desire to view his full catalogue of films.Sadly,I have always felt very nervous about seeing his legendary films in case of being disappointed,due to my big expectation of his films.In the second half of 2010 I found out that a big number of his films had been brought out re-masted,so month by month I picked up one of the films for my dad to enjoy.With hearing about people making New Year revolutions,I decided that I would make a Film Year revolution and at last make sure that I got round to seeing what I have been missing for years...View on the film:During my first viewing of the film,I have to admit that I was very surprise by the excellent mature and patient directing of Hitchcock,which was very different to the style that I had expected,due to seeing ""spoof"" versions of famous Hitchcock films,where they made it look as if the camera would find it impossible to stay in one place.Thankfully Hitch is actually the complete opposite,with only using shots of Fergusions Vertigo during moments where the character is at some of his weakest moments.Hitchcock also uses the camera to show the destructive breakdown for each of the characters,With the truly unforgettable dream sequence Hichcock does amazingly well at showing how much damaged Madeleine has done to Scotties mental state,although Hitch shows that Madeleine also has to pay a price,with a very daring ending,that probably most directors even now, would not choose.Whilst I heard a few years ago about the now mis-quoted infamous quote about how Hitchcock through actors should be treated,with this amazing film,I think that it is very easy to actually see that Hitchcock wanted to get the best performances from the stunning cast.With the sadly underrated Kim Novak giving an astonishing performance as ""Madeleine"",who she shows "" may"" be struggling with a personality disorder,which Novak excellently shows to be slowly bubbling over into her life.Although he was much older than her in real life,James Stewart does amazingly well at showing the agonising desire that Scottie has for Madeleine,with all the brilliant scenes that him and Novak both share,being filled with an amazing intensity.Final view on the film:An amazing classic,that can be watched again and again,thanks to terrific performances and stunning dream-like directing from Hitchcock.",Vertigo
37,anaconda-40658,Going Up!,9,10 June 2015,"Vertigo (1958): Dir: Alfred Hitchcock / Cast: James Stewart, Kim Novak, Tom Helmore, Barbara Bel Geddes, Henry Jones: Spellbinding thriller about mysterious unknowns and romance that spirals out of control. James Stewart plays an ex detective who fears heights but summoned by an old college friend to investigate the strange behaviour of his wife. What follows is obsession as Stewart grows closer to his subject until tragedy hits and overwhelming facts surface. Director Alfred Hitchcock begins in noir fashion then ventures into romance and suspense, but the third act reveals a complete turn of events as Stewart attempts to create what was deemed lost. This is Stewart's fourth film for Hitchcock and he plays John Ferguson with the need to conquer his trauma and restore his loss. Kim Novak is fantastic in duo roles playing the fearfully paralyzed and the subject of restoration. Tom Helmore has a pivotal role but unfortunately he is way too obvious as Novak's husband. We never trust him, which subtracts elements where a more trusting type might render more a surprise. Perhaps casting an actor who doesn't scream guilty the moment he appears on screen would have helped. Nonetheless the role is detailed and sufficient. Barbara Bel Geddes steals scenes as Stewart's refuge who stands by despite misdirected affections. Tremendous visual achievement about trauma and obsession. Score: 9 ½ / 10",Vertigo

40,christopher-underwood,breathtaking,10,4 April 2007,"Surely Hitchcock's finest film, this sophisticated, dream like swirling concoction grabs you from the start of the hypnotic titles and the opening frantic roof top chase. That slight distance that can seem apparent sometimes between Hitchcock and his actors works in his favour here as we struggle to see our way through this nightmare. For me Barbara Del Geddes' 'Midge' is less satisfactory than the rest because her character seems to not have the same depth or historic connection. She seems like a child or somebody escaped from some other movie. I know her part was written in to help Stewart's character reveal the 'story so far' as you might say but her perky 'normality' and inability to convince as an 'artist' detract somewhat from the scenes at her apartment. Incidentally it always seems odd to me that Stewart seems so comfortable in this dizzyingly high dwelling with the city spread out beneath. All that said the movie is still absolutely breathtaking. The Herrmann music helps enormously but there is no doubt that Hitch has every frame of this film etched in his mind and never puts a foot wrong. We see Stewart reluctantly begin to follow Novak (in devastating form), then become more interested and then obsessed and the later scenes where his needs become more desperate are some of the most chilling in cinema.",Vertigo

'Vertigo' Synopsis: A retired San Francisco detective suffering from acrophobia investigates the strange activities of an old friend's wife, all the while becoming dangerously obsessed with her.'Vertigo' has everything going for it, except, for its mercilessly slow-pacing. Sure, not every story needs to be fast-paced, but at least there needs to be proper pacing. The only minus point of 'Vertigo' is its pacing. But coming to the winning points, Hitchcock creates a world of doubt & deceiving with dexterity. He Directs this difficult human-tale, authoritatively. Alec Coppel & Samuel A.

Editing is dull.Performance-Wise: James Stewart enacts his part with gusto. Kim Novak is highly competent.

44,JamesHitchcock,Hitchcock Ahead of His Time,9,6 July 2017,"John Ferguson, a San Francisco police detective, has been forced to take early retirement because he has developed vertigo following an incident in which a colleague was killed falling from a roof. He is hired by an old college friend, Gavin Elster, to follow Gavin's much younger wife Madeleine, who he believes is in danger. According to Elster, Madeleine may have become possessed by the spirit of her great-grandmother Carlotta Valdes, a society beauty who committed suicide at the age of 26 when she was abandoned by her lover. Madeleine herself is now 26, and Elster fears that she may meet the same fate.Madeleine certainly appears to be obsessed by Carlotta. Ferguson follows her to the mission church where her great-grandmother is buried and to the Legion of Honor art museum where Carlotta's portrait hangs on the wall. Elster's fear that Madeleine may be suicidal seems to be borne out when she casts herself into San Francisco bay; fortunately Ferguson is on hand to rescue her. The two become acquainted and start to meet one another, eventually falling in love. Madeleine's mental health, however, does not improve, and she eventually kills herself by jumping from a church tower. Ferguson is unable to save her on this occasion because his vertigo has prevented him from following her up the tower. I won't detail the plot any further, because from this point onward it depends upon an ingenious twist which I don't want to give away. Suffice it to say that, as normal with Alfred Hitchcock, there is a rational rather than a supernatural explanation for everything we see.Although ""Vertigo"" was a modest box-office success when first released in 1958, the critical reception was unenthusiastic. Since then, however, its reputation has grown, and today it is often cited as one of Hitchcock's best films. Indeed, it is regularly listed among the best films ever, and in 2012 the British Film Institute even voted it the single best film of all time, just ahead of ""Citizen Kane"". I think that this growth in enthusiasm is due to the fact that Hitchcock was ahead of his time, in terms of both technique and content. Technically, it was one of the first films to use a distorted perspective to disorientate the viewer and accentuate Ferguson's sense of vertigo. This effect is heightened by numerous shots of vehicles going down (but not up) San Francisco's numerous steep hills, by Hitchcock's use of the dolly zoom (which was to become known as the ""Vertigo effect"" and by an eerie musical score from Hitch's favourite composer, Bernard Herrmann.Earlier Hitchcock films had normally had a fairly conventional moral structure and a happy ending with the villain dead or in police custody and the hero free to marry the lovely and virtuous blonde heroine. ""Vertigo"" is far more complex in this respect. The ending is a downbeat one and the principal villain is never seen to pay for his crime, something which caused Hitchcock some trouble with the censor. James Stewart, at one time Hollywood's Mr Nice Guy, plays an obsessive, emotionally conflicted character, something he had already done in the series of Westerns he made with Anthony Mann, such as ""The Naked Spur"". This was the last of the four films which Stewart made with Hitchcock and, in my view, by far the best. (He was not at his best in ""Rope"", and both ""Rear Window"" and the remade ""The Man Who Knew Too Much"" have always struck me as overrated).Kim Novak is as lovely as any Hitchcock heroine, and even blonder than most, but her character is morally ambiguous and certainly cannot be seen as virtuous. It is said that Hitchcock was not happy with her performance, possibly because she was a last-minute stand-in for his preferred choice Vera Miles, who had to withdraw when she became pregnant, and he never used her again. I have never understood what his problem was, as Novak makes Madeleine not only beautiful but also suitably elegant and enigmatic, a woman capable of love and yet tormented by some dreadful secret. Some have suggested that Novak was too young to be convincing as the love-interest of the fifty-year-old Stewart, but older man/younger woman romances were commonplace in films from the fifties, and one more would not have seemed strange at the time. There is a good supporting performance from Barbara Bel Geddes as Midge Wood, Ferguson's ex-fiancée with whom he shares a curious, now-platonic, relationship, although she is clearly still hoping for something more.The Hitchcock film with which ""Vertigo"" has most in common is probably ""Marnie"", with which it shares the theme of a beautiful but emotionally troubled young woman. The two films also have similar colour palettes, dominated by greens and reds. These colours do not have the symbolic significance here that they do in ""Marnie"", but it is quite possible that Hitchcock intended a deliberate contrast between the attractive photography of San Francisco, America's most photogenic city, and the sinister events of the plot. ""Vertigo"" would have been a very different film had it been shot in black-and-white.The years 1958-1960 can be seen as Hitchcock's anni mirabiles, the period in which he produced three masterpieces in as many years, ""Vertigo"", ""North by North-West"" and ""Psycho""; he was never, in my view, to work quite at this level again, although ""Marnie"" comes close. The three films are very different from one another. ""North by North-West"" is (along with ""The 39 Steps"") Hitchcock's best-ever treatment of his familiar ""innocent-man-caught-up-in-criminal-conspiracy"" theme. ""Psycho"" is his most probing analysis of the psychology of the criminal mind. And ""Vertigo"" is something unique in his work, a strange, enigmatic and disturbing mystery. 9/10",Vertigo

Hitchcock practically reinvented cinema techniques with this. Some of them (such as the lens effects) are outdated and could be altered more drastically nowadays but that is irrelevant - it still holds up despite its dated quality and that's what matters.

47,DKosty123,The Master Does It Again,9,24 December 2006,"Alfred Hitchcock made a lot of excellent films. This James Stewart - Kim Novack film is a gem. The cast is extremely well suited for the film. Vera Miles was the original choice of Alfred to play Novaks role but production delays because of Hitch's Gall Bladder surgery & then Miles could not do the film because she was pregnant.The script is based upon a French novel, the original working title of the film is ""From the Dead"".Stewart is a policeman who gets a fear of heights on the job, & then his fears are played by a evil one who cons him into believing someone he loves is dead. He nearly goes off a commits suicide when he finds out he has been used for a dishonest purpose when he finds the girl he fell in love with, only to lose her again.Barbara Bel Geddes (Miss Ellie on Dallas) is dandy in support as Stewarts lady in waiting. Novak, Stewart, & Bel Geddes are intense in their roles. Ellen Corby (Grandma Walton) & Raymond Bailey (Milburn Drysdale on the Beverly Hillbillies) also do support roles. This film has great special effects The restored version looks great with over $1 million dollars invested in it by Universals restoration team. San Francisco & the Bay Bridge look very well in the shots there. Hitchcock actually chose the locations for this film while he was shooting Strangers on Train in 1951. San Francisco never looks better on film then in this one.Bernard Herman does a great score.

48,lasttimeisaw,Vertigo,8,25 November 2012,"About two months ago, when Sight & Sound magazine announced their critics polls of my film of all time (a referendum carried out every decade), VERTIGO has unanticipatedly usurped CITIZEN KANE's seemingly invincible titleholder, which as a matter of course, has ensured many discordant responses, so it seems to be a perfect time to watch Hitchcock's (at least currently) crème de la crème. I eschewed any possible spoilers before embarking on the film (a BluRay set of 1996 restored version), it has been fully testified (regardless of the faintly drawn-out stalking sequences, great framing nevertheless) that a stirring frisson is duly on the course of solving the absorbing doppelgänger riddle. Visually there are some ground-breaking craftsmanship in the film, from the opening eye- focusing montages to the recurrent vertigo motif, even an abrupt cartoon snippet during the hair-raising nightmare scenes (which I estimate should be credited to the restore department). But the magnetic gravitation is the enigmatic pleasure from the perspective of a mutual love affair between a well-clad former detective and an equally enigmatic married woman (not the generic femme fatale brand though) whose motivation has been tainted since the very beginning. So in spite of that the set-up is almost immaculately deployed (until a rather second-rate glitch to culminate the finale), but one thing might not be so popular as it was half a century ago, the shifting role of female in the society, Kim Novak's character's vulnerability and fatalism infatuation just doesn't feel sound enough to elevate the plot onto the final peak. Partially it is also the performers' problem, Novak's glacial distance cannot pull herself through as a deft actor (neither for the scheme nor for the film), so it descends to a mere sexual impulse from James Stewart's standpoint, which I don't suppose is Hitchcock's idea. Also Stewart's paranoid ""minute copy"" compulsion does mar some empathy toward him. The film at bottom is a two-hander, so Barbara Bel Geddes and Tom Helmore are the only supporting roles which are all underdeveloped, particularly, Bel Geddes' s one-sided affection has a buoyant start but completely sidelined after her inappropriate painting incident, leaving an unusual loose end. So the film has its old-fashioned value of love and done an acute anatomy of the hallucinatory symptoms when one falls for a feigned personality (the torture is bilateral), but calls it ""the best film ever"" is a way too grave grandstanding which does no good to any films at all (even CITIZEN KANE has to pay its price), but I daresay 10 years later, VERTIGO will add another title under its belt, ""a one-time champion of the best film of all time"".",Vertigo
49,Red-Barracuda,A dark and enigmatic work from Hitch,9,15 March 2010,"Vertigo is Alfred Hitchcock's most personal film. On the surface it's a mystery-thriller but ultimately it explores the nature of obsession; in particular one man's dangerous and uncontrollable infatuation with an enigmatic blonde woman. This being a trait that the director himself was known for, as the many peroxide leading ladies that populate his films attest.Vertigo is a somewhat enigmatic film. It doesn't offer up all its nuances on a single viewing. At face value it's a mystery, but if only taken as such it can seem potentially a little underwhelming. The plot could be seen as a little too artificial to be altogether satisfying. It's only when you begin to realize that the underlying obsession epitomized by James Stewart's character Scottie is really just as important a theme that the film's true nature in unveiled. His attitude towards Judy/Madeleine has a sinister edge. Vertigo ultimately is about a man who wants to have sex with a dead woman who in turn is possessed by another dead woman. This dark undertone only becomes apparent after the mystery of Madeleine's death has been revealed in flash-back and Hitchcock focuses in on the unhealthy obsession that underpins Scottie's persona. I think it's this skillful combination of ideas that makes Vertigo one of Hitchcock's signature films; the way he subverts the thriller narrative to explore more personal and dark themes is what makes it such an important movie in the director's canon.As with other Hitchcock films, Vertigo is beautifully presented, with lovely cinematography and a gorgeous use of colour; the rich reds and greens in particular fill the screen with Technicolor brilliance. This visual splendour is accompanied by a beautiful score from Bernard Herrmann that serves the dreamlike tone very well. All of this combines together to help create the haunting tone that the movie has, especially in the early stages where the film more or less works as a ghost story. In particular, Scottie's pursuit of the mysterious Madeleine in the early part of the film is wonderful. It's played out for the most part with no dialogue, images instead lead us on.The general consensus is that the age of the personal film-maker dawned in the 60's with the advent of the New Hollywood directors. However, Vertigo is proof that in the 50's one of the older cinematic masters was ahead of the game.",Vertigo

51,OllieSuave-007,Afraid of heights?,7,21 June 2015,"Vertigo is one of Alfred Hitchcock's mysteries, a story where former police officer John Ferguson (James Stewart), acrophobia-plagued, was asked by friend Gavin Elster to follow his wife Madeleine because he is afraid of his mental well-being; he thinks she might be possessed by deceased woman's spirit. Hitchcock brilliantly combines mystery and romance in this movie, keeping you engaged from start to finish. From Ferguson following Madeleine everywhere to her paranormal behavior, the mystery and suspense builds as the story momentum goes along, giving you an unpredictable outcome and plot twits. It makes you guess if Madeleine is really possessed. And, even John's acrophobia contributes somehow into the plot. There is also some slight humor in the form of quick comebacks and sarcasm delivered by the movie leads. The acting was well done as each actor gave memorable performances; James Stewart and Kim Novak made a great duo and added onto the story's romance and dramatic subplots. ***spoiler ahead***I was, however, was bummed at the ending - they really should have kept the Judy character on and actually show the true antagonist apprehended. With such a captivating movie from the start to come to an abrupt end, it was a bit of an unpleasant shock. ***spoiler ends***Overall, it is still a nicely done and truly mysterious movie that will keep you guessing until the end.

52,cherold,"too long, too slow, but worth watching",7,3 July 2009,"I'm not quite sure what I thought of Vertigo when I first saw it, which was a long time ago, but I recall being underwhelmed. Since it's generally considered one of Hitchcock's major works I decided I'd give it another chance.It is an odd duck.This is a prime example of Hitchcock confusing the audience by having charming, likable actors play awful people. Stewart's character is not a good guy at all, but Stewart essentially plays him as one. I could write a long list of the character's moral lapses, but Stewart doesn't play the character as a bad guy. It's an interesting approach.One thing I recall clearly from the first time I saw this movie is I thought it was very slow, and that was not a trick of the memory. Call it deliberately paced if you like, but this movie really takes its time. There is very little dialog and quite a lot of the camera watching Stewart staring at Novak.One of the oddities of the movie is that the intriguing central mystery is explained two-thirds of the way through. And yet, the film is at its most interesting in that final third. At this point the movie is simply a sad, disturbing character study powered by Novak's vulnerability.Vertigo is a very interesting movie. I imagine you could write a very long analysis of it - how its structured and character motivation and all that. But its entertainment value is iffier. Outside of Barbara Bel Geddes, whose sharp, subtle performance makes the film far more entertaining than it would otherwise be, the movie can feel a bit too vague and wandering.",Vertigo

54,Robert_duder,Terrifyingly brilliant or terrifyingly awful...I think I lost my mind for two hours in psychosis,6,13 January 2013,"I am not a Hitchcock aficionado, in fact I have only ever seen one or two of his films, the obvious more mainstream ones. I thought I had seen Vertigo before but I had not. So I went to see it on the big screen in a classic film series. Well...I've been Hitchcocked. There were times I thought I was losing my mind. The film is mind numbing and I do not know whether that is good or bad. Every time I thought the film was ending, it kept going. Unlike some classic films, I didn't feel like Vertigo has aged well. I felt like parts of it come across as incredibly campy now and cheesy including the animation of Johnny's dream sequence. The film is appropriately haunting as you would expect from Hitchcock and the twist for me was actually a lot of fun, although again it seemed completely implausible. It seemed like Vertigo tried to be about five different genres of film and certainly covered a gambit of concepts. Obsession, lust, murder, the supernatural, reincarnation, and all with the opening scene of a detective afraid of heights. I think I would need a student of film to explain to me what on earth his vertigo had to with the film whatsoever. Yes, it ended up playing a role in the climax but was it necessary? The film was more about obsession than anything to do with vertigo.I love Jimmy Stewart, adore him in fact. He is a poignant and powerful presence in any role and this is no exception. Anyone else in the role would have let it falter. His character literally loses his mind throughout the course of the film and deals with the obsession, and the illness and the mental instability and its frightening to watch him do it. His character is bizarre and he pulls it off with class. I don't know a lot about Hitchcock and his blonde bombshells but was Kim Novak a complete joke in this film? I don't know if its the age of the performance but she reeked of pretentious sarcasm and downright campy performance. Her scenes were literally laughable and she looked ridiculous in nearly every scene. To call her performance overacting is the understatement of the decade. She overacts every scene and every expression and it was painful to watch right up to her laugh out loud climax. Barbara Bel Geddes (my beloved Miss Ellie--I'm a Dallas fan) plays a bizarre little role as Stewart's best friend and unrequited love interest Midge. I say its bizarre because their relationship is left unexplored and you feel like there is so much history there that you never get to see anything from. Still Geddes is perfect and her and Stewart have this unusual but palpable chemistry on screen together. Tom Helmore plays his part very well and he and Stewart also have good chemistry on screen together during their one major scene. Stewart carries the film though and easily.I don't pretend to understand Hitchcock and I don't even begin to have the pretentiousness to presume I should say what is good or bad about one of the most iconic directors in history. The film just hurt my brain trying to figure out what it was he was doing. The SanFrancisco backdrop seemed to play such a significant part of the whole concept but yet was never really used to any great degree. In a couple of scenes Stewart is clearing driving on the wrong side of the road...why?! Was this just a mistake or an inversion of film? Or was there a deeper meaning. I kept trying to see Hitchcock's trademark brilliance but I'm not sure I understand. I wasn't intrigued as much as I was confused and I wasn't entertained as much as I was terrified by how overwhelming the whole experience was. I don't mean to take away anything from those that adore the film but I would just like to sit down and debate/discuss this movie for hours. It isn't anything I would seek out for entertainment but I intend on exploring Hitchcock's films more in the weeks to come. I am so glad I saw this because I can say that I've seen it and got to see it on the big screen!! 6/10",Vertigo
55,Lejink,Great heights,9,24 March 2014,"Hitchcock's masterpiece? Well, that's debatable, when there are at least six other major contenders I could think of. And yes, I've read the criticisms, about James Stewart being too old in the lead, the twist revealed half an hour before the ending, Judy's lack of surprise when Scottie turns up at her door and more, but in a great movie, you suspend these inconsistencies and instead let yourself get wrapped up in the whole experience.Right from the start, from Saul Bass's literally eye-popping title sequence and Bernard Hermann's hypnotic theme music, a spell is created although being Hitchcock, this is occasionally punctured with surprise elements. Immediately we're catapulted into a thrilling roof-top chase, culminating in the tragic consequences of Stewart's Scottie Ferguson character's vertigo. He seems to suffer a nervous breakdown and despite the devoted attention of the adoring Barbara Bel Geddes, he falls into a carefully contrived murder plot managed by an old friend, keen to inherit his wife's fortune. To do this, Scottie is manipulated into tailing and then building up a relationship with Kim Novak's Madeleine, yet another of the director's icy cool blondes, his vertigo ruthlessly exploited as the murder is perpetrated. However a chance meeting on the street with Madeleine's doppelgänger leads them both back to the scene of the crime with tragic consequences for both.I don't think there's another of Hitchcock's films where he displays his genius so well. The legendary fluidity of his camera we see time and again, it being particularly suited to the rise and fall of the streets of San Francisco as Scottie pursues his prey. Of course it's a sexy film and naturally being Hitchcock, there's a dark undercurrent to this, what with the ""romantic hero"" indulging in something approaching necrophilia in recreating his dream (but dead) woman, plus just how does Madeleine end up naked in his bed, after he's saved her from drowning? The pacing is exemplary, at key points time is compressed for dramatic effect, at other times the camera languidly relaxes allowing the viewer to witness the wonderful cinematography of Frisco's landmarks in the bright Californian sunshine.The dramatic finish, where we're literally left hanging with Stewart and wondering what his next move will be atop the clock tower as his dream is destroyed a second time is a masterpiece of brevity and suspense.Essays have been written about this film almost since it was first released, itself a sign of the complexity and the depth at work here. I'm not one for re-watching films too much, preferring to see something I never have before, but ""Vertigo"" keeps dragging me back in wonder and admiration of one of the masters of cinema at his considerable best.",Vertigo
56,ElMaruecan82,A Haunting Masterpiece ...,10,19 July 2011,"""Vertigo"" draws a thin line between reality and our subconscious haunted by ghostly memories and tormenting traumas, and on this tightrope we wonder whether we should jump to wake up from that madness-embracing nightmare, or plunge into that magnificent meditative sky, or simply walk and walk trying not to faint from dizziness, or like James Stewart, not to succumb to acrophobia, translation: fear of heights.Speaking of heights, ""Vertigo"" tops any other creation from the Master. Even Hitchcock's greatest films are never flawless, but ""Vertigo"" flirts with perfection. More than a captivating thriller gripping your heart from one mystery to another, with every pieces of the puzzle reassembling at the end for a spectacular finale, the movie has a unique quality rarely displayed in Hitchcock's films with such intensity, I'm speaking of course of the torrid romance between the private-eye John ""Scottie"" Ferguson and Madeleine Elster, his old friend's wife whom he must follow to understand the reasons of her peculiar behavior. Madeleine is portrayed by Kim Nowak whose breath-taking inner beauty surpassed the most beautiful panoramic shots of San Francisco, masterfully sketched by the Master.Indeed, the casting of Kim Nowak is extraordinary as she really looks like the kind of women that would obsess us and as usual, James Stewart's ordinary look makes him on the save wavelength as the audience. We identify with him while the internal focus creates a very disturbing empathy as much as a constant desire to understand Madeleine, while she visits the mysterious grave of a Spanish girl named Carlotta Valdes, and contemplates her painting while Scottie follows, or shall we say, contemplates her too. Kim Nowak's eyes communicate something desperate and affecting as we want to grab her, but at the same time, she's like totally inaccessible floating in a cloud of divinity, fragile and perfect, her vulnerability inspires Scottie's strength, and her lips with a bright red suggesting a bleeding heart and these sensual and haunting eyebrows, well, such a divine beauty can only inspire a genuine devotion Never had a chemistry been so intense and so passionate, it's not the first romance featured in a Hitchcock's film but this time, it works for the same reason it didn't, in my opinion, between Cary Grant and Eva Marie Saint in ""North by Northwest"" or even James Stewart and Grace Kelly in ""Rear Window"". It worked because it wasn't a conventional subplot but an important and relevant element of the story: hadn't they loved each other, never the guilt would have tormented both of them after the famous scheme. And everything happens is such a genuine way, Scottie spontaneously rescued her from the unforgettable suicidal scene in San Francisco Bay, the way their passion grows as she reveals her possession by the soul of Carlotta Valdes, only a man haunted by a traumatic guilt could understand this feeling.""Vertigo"" is about guilt as a force that either blocks you or drives you, to a point it can be exploited to commit a crime, and as a double-edged sword, can help to solve the same crime. Scottie suffers from acrophobia since the day he indirectly caused the falling of a cop who came to rescue him. The iconic silhouette falling into the spiral is the allegory of the psychological guilt that tortures Scottie, and resurrects when he's at heights, making him incapable of moving, and as he proved it, of helping someone in danger. The directorial genius of Hitchcock is to have communicated this unsettling feeling by inventing the iconic ""Vertgio"" shot, magnifying the background while zooming out, in the iconic tower scene. We really feel Scottie's dizziness. The whole story is told from his perspective, marvelously and meticulously constructed from that patient set-up that intrigues us and captivates us about Madeleine, to her apparent death, and then her mysterious reappearance. As we wonder, if we're not haunted too, by the ghost of Madeleine too, the immersion is total.The psychological aspect of ""Vertigo"" is one of the key elements that places ""Vertigo"" among the greatest films. Scottie is such an endearing character, trying to conceal many wounds in his heart, with his own weaknesses unfairly exploited. There's another interesting character as the ex-fiancée Midge, who tries to reach Scottie, in vain. She tells the only cure for the acrophobia would be another shock, but there was something more powerful, boiling in Scottie's heart, a quest of redemption that would have probably inspired Scorsese. And when Scottie rediscovers the identical twin of Madeleine, as Judy Barton, and tries to make her look like Madeleine, there's something touching in Nowak's distraught attitude. She accepts everything from Scottie, tormented by the desire to reconstruct the sincere romance, or to redeem herself, because she fooled him.But fate wanted Judy to betray herself with one necklace that belonged to Carlotta, and in one flashlight of realization, Scottie understood the whole 'plot', and decides to change the program and go back to the tower. Scottie stops being a follower, a passive character, he acts, and finally gets the truth from Judy, and when they finally embrace, in one ironic twist that would haunt cinematic memories for eternity, the film starts like it ended, with Judy falling to her death, frightened by the shadow of a nun, who came to ring the mission bell. The sight of Stewart in the top of the tower is the triumph of a man who overcame his handicap through an emotional shock that cost him the life of his precious love, what an irony, what a finale and what a film! ""Vertigo"" elevates us to a unique universe with the hypnotic beauty of a Kandinsky's painting and the alienating psychological torment of a Kafka novel, the whole chef-d'oeuvre orchestrated by the Maestro Bernard Herrman. ""Vertigo"" is purely and simply, Hitchcock's Masterpiece with a major M and a major H, like in Haunting",Vertigo
57,paul2001sw-1,No towering achievement,3,23 March 2006,"Alfred Hitchcock has a reputation as one of the outstanding film-makers of his era; but to a modern viewer, 'Vertigo' disappoints. The plotting is as torturous as any modern thriller, but the 1950 production values continually let it down: one grows tired of out-of-doors scenes transparently shot in the studio (and even the scenes actually shot on location are curiously devoid of passers-by), there's a very clumsy (though admittedly innovative) dream sequence, even the fact that the two leads are unable to even kiss each other properly starts to grate after a while. This might suggest that Hitchcock's only failing with this movie was over-ambition, but unfortunately, it isn't so: for he also fails to get decent performances from his leading actors, stiff-as-a-board Jimmy Stweart and icy Kim Novak (a typical Hitchcock blonde) generate absolutely no on-screen chemistry. And both have complex roles to play: one of them undergoes a kind of nervous breakdown, while the other simulates the same thing; but neither can play their roles with sufficient depth to make this story work as psychological melodrama. There is one interesting female character - played by Barbara Bel Geddes - but she is mysteriously written out half way though for no good reason. Compare the performances in this movie to those being put in by the likes of Marlon Brando or Orson Welles at the same period in time, and one has to pass harsh judgement. There are still a few interesting details: it's amazing how little dialogue Hitchcock dares get away with, and the very bleak ending is surprising for a mainstream film. But it's impossible to invest any emotional feeling in the story; and that's surprising, given Hitchcock's towering legend.",Vertigo
58,Pjtaylor-96-138044,Dizzying cinema.,8,20 July 2020,"The opening to 'Vertigo (1958)' may just be the most instantly gripping in all of cinema, starting with a breathtaking Saul Bass title sequence that smash cuts - propelled by what's possibly Bernard Herrmann's best musical score - to a phenomenal shot of a hand darting onto a ladder rung. It's great stuff that gets you on the edge of your seat right away. Yet, the rest of the movie isn't focused on the same kind of relentless suspense. Rather, it settles into its own odd mix of alluring investigation and ahead-of-its-time characterisation that constantly keeps you guessing as to what's next. It's always one step ahead of the audience, even when it seems to let them in on its secrets. It has a rather unconventional two-half structure that, essentially, hasn't quite been done since. It's unconventional through and through, actually. It subverts almost every expectation, especially when it comes to its protagonist. It's engrossing no matter how many times you watch it, in part thanks to its ambiguity. It's really layered, too. There's just this strange, almost mesmerising quality to the piece. It's entertaining and intriguing, an incredibly well-crafted picture from its opening frame. While it may not be as enjoyable as some of Hitchcock's other work, it's certainly among his best. 8/10",Vertigo
59,richardchatten,Last Year in San Francisco,8,31 July 2018,"An awe-inspiring array of state-of-the-art 50's film production values - high voltage stars Jimmy Stewart and the almost supernaturally beautiful Kim Novak in a killer wardrobe by Edith Head, Bernard Herrmann's magnificent score, Robert Burks' glowing Vistavision & Technicolor travelogue photography of San Francisco and of the surrounding area and of Miss Novak, handsome sets, titles by Saul Bass, all under the firm hand of maestro Hitchcock at the top of his game - combine to camouflage an extremely nasty and wildly improbable tale of a cruel and preposterously complicated conspiracy to murder, and it's gormless patsy.One can understand contemporary audiences' bewilderment at Hitchcock lavishing all this care on a mood piece which ravishes the senses as it throws plausibility out the window at every opportunity; but with the passage of time it's fifties trappings make it seem ever more exotic, with even Midge's geeky spectacles looking like design classics. (It probably influenced 'Last Year at Marienbad'.)James Stewart's Scottie is already exhibiting an unpleasant superciliousness even as early as his treatment of hotel manager Ellen Corby, and his treatment of both Midge and Judith makes you want to slap his face. The simulteously demure and erotic moment when Judith eventually presents herself to him fully suited-up with her hair up for his delectation is a typically cunning Hitchcock moment doing more with less which will strike a chord with any man on whose behalf the lady in his life has at long last agreed to made him very happy indeed by finally getting into biking leathers or a policewoman's uniform. If only Scottie had been content to stop there and not persisted in being such a morose, self-centred oaf indulging his hang-ups to the point of destruction...",Vertigo
60,ThomasDrufke,"Karma, Deception, and Obsession.",10,13 August 2016,"Alfred Hitchcock wowed audiences for decades with an immense talent of deception and artistic flare, and perhaps no movie was a better showcase for those talents than his 1958 hit Vertigo. An impressive tale about obsession.In honor of Alfred Hitchcock's birthday, I decided to re-watch Vertigo and reevaluate just how well it holds up upon repeated viewings. There's nothing quite like the shock of watching it for the first time, but I had a chance to dig my teeth into the legendary performances of James Stewart and Kim Novak while being dazzled by Hitchcock's meticulously crafted story.One of the most impressive aspects about Vertigo is that it's clearly framed as a story about someone with Vertigo dealing with a peculiar case, but really, it's about obsession, and a man digging just a little bit too deep into a case. A theme that Christopher Nolan seemed to take into his film, Memento, in 2000. Vastly different stories, but similar execution from the director's chair.An easy way to identify a film's tone is through the score, and Hitchcock always seemed to get the best out of the legend, Bernard Herrmann. His score here is both haunting and alluring. I love the way he balanced the score with the uncomfortable feeling we get as an audience watching Stewart's character obsess, along with the noir- ish love story that forms as well.Amidst Hitchcock's mind boggling story are a few darn good performances by Stewart and Novak. Stewart, typically known strictly in likable protagonist roles, finds himself in a more complex and even unlikable alley. There's certainly times where the lines between protagonist and antagonist are blurred, but Stewart does a great job at rounding out his character. Novak, on the other-hand, plays a more mysterious role but nonetheless just as significant. Aside from the characters in Psycho, Novak may have had the most difficult time portraying just who Hitchcock desired for this role. If there was ever a Hitchcock blonde who deserved a Best Actress Oscar, I think it was Novak.Overall, Vertigo holds up just as well as the first time I watched it, and perhaps even better in some aspects. There's a reason this film is at the top of so many greatest films of all time lists.+Hitchcock's colorful direction+Stewart and Novak were at the top of their game+Herrmann's score+Themes still hold up10/10",Vertigo
61,gbill-74877,Wonderfully disturbing,9,28 July 2017,"What a wonderful, creepy, beautiful, disturbing film this is. From the opening credits, Hitchcock makes us uneasy with spiraling patterns on the screen, which hints at the vertigo/acrophobia to follow, but what we find are so many other disturbances and twists of the mind: obsession, guilt, insanity, and manipulation. There is creepy sexual desire, and what self-abasing lengths a woman will go to do what 'does it' for a man. Jimmy Stewart turns in a great performance, but as a nitpick, he's twice the age of Kim Novak (50 and 25), and also looks too old to have gone to college with his sidekick Barbara Bel Geddes (who's great by the way). The film takes place in absolutely gorgeous scenery in San Francisco, Muir Woods and Mission San Juan Bautista, and it's at once both dream-like and nightmarish. It feels like a quiet movie with its pace and small cast, but there is tension and mystery throughout. There are several stunning moments, which I won't spoil, and the ending is absolutely brilliant. Hitchcock's delving into dark places of the mind, his storytelling, and his camera angles, are all superlative. Excellent film.",Vertigo
62,g-bodyl,Keeps You In Suspense!,9,17 August 2015,"Vertigo is the first Alfred Hitchcock film I have experienced and that is one of the many reasons why the film will stick to my heart forever. I was surprised how this film received mixed reviews when originally released, but I guess the contemporary audience was not ready for him just yet. This film fits the definition of a mystery, but it is much deeper than that. It's a love story, and a painful one to boot. The love expressed here is desirable, but also painful, yearning, and something that can be hard to watch. That is what makes this movie a classic and one of Hitchcock's best movies in a long line of memorable, successful movies. I really enjoyed the film and the dark attributes it possesses. Hitchcock's film is about a retired detective named Scottie who suffers from acrophobia, or the fear of heights. He is tasked by a former colleague to follow his wife, who has been acting strange lately. Scottie reluctantly agrees to take the case. Once he does, he realizes something strange is happening. Not only that, he begins to take a painful obsession over this girl, Madeleine. We get some fine, professional displays of acting here. James Stewart does a great job as Scottie. He, along with the new camera-work displayed by Hitchcock, really showed how paranoid he is with heights. And that really gave me the creeps just watching him be hesitant to even climb stairs. Kim Novak does a great job in two roles of hers, especially as Madeleine Elster. She brings a sensitivity to her character which I found to be reassuring when it comes to female characters during this era. Overall, Vertigo is a very suspenseful thriller that is often scary to watch. If you have seen this film and suffer from agoraphobia, perhaps this is the film to blame. But nonetheless, films like these is why Hitchcock have been called the master of suspense. Even conversations have an aura of what is going to happen next? The ending is unexpected and really good. If you like masterful suspense films, then Vertigo is the film for you. My Grade: A-",Vertigo

Kim Novak's performance was also breathtaking. Its one of the most critically acclaimed movies of all time, and that's no surprise, it is a crazy ride from start to finish and you never know what's going to happen next.

64,secondtake,Desperate love story with murder on the wing,10,25 July 2009,"Vertigo (1958)This movie isn't quite about what it seems to be about at first, and we shift from an odd detective case to a case of falling in love, to a case of just falling, and then the movie goes through one of the most convincing psychological twists in cinema. That is, the second portion of the movie is a brilliant inquiry into the mind of the retired detective played by Jimmy Stewart, and into obsession, and eventually to revelation. While the crime is solved eventually, it's really a small point. This is a love story, and a complicated one but also a passionate one. The ending will leave you gasping.There are celebrated aspects to note: the psychedelic insert in the middle as a dream, the zoom/pull effects of vertigo, even the classic femme fatale/plain girl contrast (the latter a brilliant Barbara Bel Geddes). And there are some less known touches, like the green neon lighting used on the interior of the room at the Empire Hotel, or the generally clear vivid brilliant Technicolor palette. There are bit parts and famous sets (the Golden Gate Bridge and the San Bautista Mission, which didn't actually have a bell tower like this one (that was added through cinema trickery). There is also an amazing use of subjective effects--the light falling improbably, or a haze covering the scene for no reason except the main character's mind. Much of this stuff pushes Hitchcock into true art film territory, and yet he keeps it a mainstream commercial flick that is accessible and popular.Most of all there is subtle deception between characters and between the movie and the viewer. Hitchcock has never preferred the sudden surprise, leaving the viewer in ruins (or just in shock). Instead, he tells you what's going on--in this case, we learn of the murderous truth halfway through the film, so that we aren't wasting energy solving the crime but are instead trying to get into the characters' heads. It is the psychology, and the conflict of desire and doubt, that drive the movie. It's not slow, by the way, it's lyrical.Some people might object to the falseness of many of the key scenes, but that's the nature of films that are not purely naturalistic. And the nature of nearly all of Hitchcock movies after 1940. Absorb the style as brush strokes--they don't get in the way of verisimilitude once you agree the truth is not the point. Drama and beauty and originality are. All of those are here full force.",Vertigo

66,callanvass,Vertigo is a haunting masterpiece from Hitchcock. It's almost mesmerizing with its storytelling (SPOILERS!),10,12 October 2013,"There are spoilers in this review, so don't read on if you feel it'll ruin your viewing experienceScottie almost dies during a roof chase on foot on the roofs of the building in San Francisco. Unfortunately, the cop that tries to save Scottie ends up plummeting to his death, and Scottie is unwilling to accept what happened, and suffers from a condition called Vertigo. Scottie retires after these events, but he ends up getting an offer from a good friend named Gavin Elster (Tom Helmore) to investigate his wife's (Kim Novak) increasingly erratic behavior. Gavin seems to think she is being possessed by the spirit of Carlotta Valdes. Scottie reluctantly agrees to follow Madeline around. He develops an uncontrollable infatuation for Madeline. He saves her from drowning in the San Francisco Bay, and the two have a romance, and fall in love. Madeline's erratic behavior leads to her death at the bell tower of the church, where Scottie is unable to save her, because of his fear of heights. Scottie's devastation doesn't go away, until he meets a woman named Judy Barton, who is an uncanny resemblance to Madeline. Scottie becomes incessant with wanting Judy to dress and look like Madeline, and falls in love all over again. What Scotty doesn't know is he is in a web of deception. It's really hard to fathom how critics lambasted and slandered this film when it was first released. After a thrilling opening, involving a chase on a roof, which sets the tone for the rest of the movie, a true movie lover should notice right away that they are in for something spectacular and special. Not only was it was way ahead of it's time for what it was going for, but Vertigo is one of the greatest thrillers of all time. It rivals Psycho & North by Northwest, and Rear Window as Alfred Hitchcock's best film. I really loved Vertigo's dreamlike atmosphere, with all the visuals. Not only is it near flawless with the storytelling, but it is also tremendous visually. It's deliberate (Or as I like to call it, thoughtful) pace, gives us much more time to get to know our lead hero. Scottie (James Stewart) is a flawed hero, one with a huge fear of heights, and a syndrome called Vertigo. He's a regular, everyday human being, and one we can all relate too. Stewart is easily able to elicit sympathy from the viewer, because of the predicament he has gotten himself into. I thought the scenes where Scottie stalks Madeline (Kim Novak) were not only chilling, but thought provoking as well. As the stalking scenes continue to commence, you start to see Scottie's job begin to turn into a precarious obsession. His infatuation veers toward an uncontrollable desire to be with Madeline. It was really engrossing to watch James Stewart's character evolveThe cinematography deserves a lot of praise for still holding up to this day. We get various colors, and many beautiful images throughout the movie. James Stewart is simply a revelation in this movie. Even when he veers towards obsession, you can't help but feel for the guy. I felt James Stewart did a tremendous job with everything. His romance with Kim Novak is deeply felt to the point where I often couldn't keep my eyes off the two. James Stewart is especially phenomenal in the second half as his obsession grows. His depression and obsession with Kim Novak is something that chilled me to the bone. It's one of the greatest, and one of the most tragic romances in the history of movies. The two were almost hypnotizing to watch at times. Kim Novak's beauty is peerless. Her manipulative, yet at the same time, lovable performance as Madeline is unforgettable. Her vulnerability as Madeline was amazing, and so was her sorrowful performance as Judy Barton. She was absolutely magnetic at times, and amazing to watch. It's impossible not to be attracted to her. I'm not sure which pair I loved more, Scottie & Madeline, or Scottie & Judy. Both were amazing in different ways. Barbara Bel Geddes (Midge) is not only likable, but funny as the girl who has a major crush on Scottie. The ending of Vertigo is absolutely heartbreaking in every sense of the word. It felt like everything crumbled down around me, and I was just beside myself in a way. I sat on my bed with a blank expression on my face, and tried to process everything that just happened. It's one of the greatest movies in cinema history. Those that call it overrated, I feel sorry for. I respect people's opinions, but this is the definition of a masterpiece, and I can't praise it enough. If you haven't seen it, what the hell are you waiting for? Get to it! you won't regret it10/10",Vertigo
67,vincentlynch-moonoi,Flawed masterpiece,8,6 September 2013,"Since nearly 600 people have already reviewed this film on IMDb, I was going to skip it. But, it's sucked me in, so here goes.First I have to say that I have a far different view of Hitchcock's career than do most. First, I don't like any of Hitchcock's pre-Hollywood films, and detest some of them (e.g., ""Murder!""). Then, in 1940, with ""Rebecca"", he seems to break out of the British fog and the films are suddenly almost all terrific...if not brilliant (with a rare exception here and there; e.g., ""Lifeboat"". But then, suddenly, in 1960, for me it all falls apart with ""Psycho"". The film has some redeeming qualities in terms of scenes, but in general I don't see it as much more than a cheap slasher movie with a little more psychology tossed in. And ""The Birds"" is for the birds...cheap horror inspired by Rachel Carson's ""A Silent Spring"". I can sit through ""Torn Curtain"", but more due to the star quality than the film itself.In terms of ""Vertigo"", there seem to be two sticking points for many people. One is the age of Jimmy Stewart (50) and Kim Novak (25). First, this is similar in many pictures with many stars -- an older male star with a younger female star. The only place it ever really bothered me was with Gary Cooper (age 56) and Audrey Hepburn (age 28) in ""Love In The Afternoon""; and then it was more about Cooper's haggard looks than the actual age difference. Here, Stewart is a rather young looking 50, and in my view, Novak plays a character more in her mid to later 30s, despite her real age. Consider the age of her husband in the film, the actor being 54 years old.The other catching point for some is the flashback scene about 1:40 into the film. Some think that the scene gives too much away, while others think it gives the film context. I watched for it in this, my third viewing of the film. I can take it either way, because in my view, in many films it's not where you're going that's as important as how you get there.A third thing sometimes criticized about the film is its length at 2:08. I don't see that as so long, and I rather like that Hitchcock lingered a bit with his scenes of San Francisco and some other locations.One thing I will criticize about many Hitchcock films is the cheapness of many of the scenes which he shot in front of a projection screen. It ruined ""To Catch A Thief"" for me, and is pretty bad in this film as well. Is this where he often tried to save money? Another thing about this film that is interesting to me is how it changes focus after the initial death of Novak's character. Up until then, the real focus has been on Novak, even though Stewart got more screen time and far more dialog. But after that initial death, the focus is even more on Stewart and his obsessions. That sudden change in focus is quite marvelous, although Stewart's obsession with the vertigo is clear in the beginning of the film...but later we see he is quite an obsessive character in many ways.One thing I am not clear on is the character played by Barbara Bel Geddes. I don't quite see the purpose...unless it is just a way to have Stewart bounce some ideas off of her.There are really only 5 actors worth mentioning in this film. I personally feel this is one of Jimmy Stewart's best roles. I'm very undecided overall about Kim Novak as an actress, but she was good here. I found Barbara Bel Geddes to be very comfortable on the screen; I wish she would have done more movie work, but I guess the blacklist soured her career for a while. Tom Helmore was good as the scheming husband; a dependable character actor. Henry Jones had a small role as the coroner, but I just love his voice inflections.The bottom line is -- is it a Hitchcock masterpiece. Although flawed, I would say yes, although not in his top 5, but somewhere in his top 10. Recommended.",Vertigo

At the request of an acquaintance, he puts his detective skills to use on a strange case. The specifics of the complex plot should not be spoiled, but this is a story of obsession.Kim Novak's performance is a tour de force that requires her to convince the viewer that she is playing multiple roles at the same time.Bernard Hermann's score is predictably stellar. It combines with the cinematography, effects, and all elements of style to create a cohesive whole that plays on the viewer's emotions. Note especially the use of color to emphasize characters' subjective points of view. And how Hitchcock places Scottie in the foreground of tall objects to subliminally remind the viewer that he lives in a world of (fearful) heights. He frequently shoots from above to exaggerate vertical distances as well.The clever screenplay seems to ""shift gears"" several times, but never loses its hold on the viewer, who must pay attention as if he is negotiating Lombard Street or risk missing an important detail. I enjoy rewatching this film periodically and discovering new components of story and style.",Vertigo
69,kenjha,Hitchcock's Masterpiece,10,5 December 2009,"A retired San Francisco police detective becomes obsessed with a woman he has been hired to tail. This is arguably Hitchcock's greatest film, a dark, fascinating mystery about obsession and control. Stewart is excellent as the befuddled detective. Novak was a limited actress but in this film her stiffness and other-worldly beauty are perfectly suited to the role of the elusive woman that Stewart must have. From the great opening scene where Stewart's vertigo is revealed to the plot twist midway to the haunting finale, this is an expertly constructed film. The on-location shooting is a big plus and Herrmann provides another of his memorable scores.",Vertigo
70,clanciai,The perfect plot going horribly wrong with a vengeance,10,14 September 2021,"The original French story by Boileau and Narzejac is an entirely different story taking place during the war in France, and after the first woman's death the protagonist gets out of France for the rest of the war to spend his years drinking in Dakar. When he returns to France he finds the other woman.Hitchcck and his team have made an entirely different story, aggrandizing the vertigo theme to become dominant of the plot and weaving around it a masterful story, with in all its absurdities makes perfectly sense all the way until Judy enters after three quarters of the film. Up till then everything that Scottie experiences is perfectly logical without any flaw, and it is quite natural that a stupid and limited policeman should accept every detail of the extensive fraud he is being subject to. Then comes the human factor and merciless unravelling of the mystery by Judy, who is equally unaware of her weakness as he is of his duplicity, wherefore she unconsciously destroys herself by her love for him.Kim Novak makes the best performance here in her best film which probably also is Hitchcock's and James Stewart's best film. She is perfectly convincing in all her three roles with all their complications of character, and even she brings everything to make sense. James Stewart is perfect as the stolid policeman who is blindly led into a blind alley of self-destruction without having any idea of what is going on. Barbara bel Geddes tries to save him as the one sensible person of no passion in the play, and we will never learn what she would do next, if she could handle it at all. Scottie probably could, but not without having lost everything.This is actually a passion play and Hichcock's most personal and beautiful film - there has never been a more beautiful film made of San Francisco. To this comes the inspired music by Bernard Hermann in what is probably also his best score if not one of the best film scores ever, all abstract but overwhelmingly expressive. The highest credit of the film is though the extremely meticulous image composition, with colors growing more expressive all the time as the film goes on, to culminate in the apotheosis when she comes out of the bathroom, the metamorphosis miraculously completed, presenting one of the most impressive moments in all film history, as the apex of the drama.",Vertigo

The story is intriguing and the characters are all very human, making it easy to relate to them. James Stewart is perfect in the lead, and Kim Novak is absolutely stunning, but a special mention must also go to Barbara Bel Geddes too. Everything falls into place perfectly, and the film has a number of aspects that can be analysed deeper, with a lot of symbolism and a number of deep themes.

Throughout the film, the audience gets the eerie feeling that nothing is as it seems. James Stewart's character feels like he's getting more than he bargained for and Kim Novak's character seems to have some secrets of her own. Even after the plot progresses and mysteries are revealed, there is clearly still more to uncover, leaving the audience on their toes. The drama and suspense are compelling, plunging us into the mad schemes that are not fully resolved by the end, leaving the audience guessing how to interpret what they have witnessed. The groundbreaking colour cinematography add a dreamlike haze to these scenes which befits the daze of the protagonists. Despite the film's reputation, the secret murder plot doesn't totally make sense and had a small chance of working for various reasons that others have pointed out.",Vertigo

75,Dr_Coulardeau,Mistrust all towers,10,30 January 2009,"This film is one of the best and not only of Hitchcock's films, but of all universal global cinema. What's good about it? Everything. And yet what exactly, if I may ask? First of all it is a beautiful love story. A man who has been disabled by life, or rather by his profession  he was a cop and saw his partner die by falling from a roof when trying to save him  and his developing a severe case of acrophobia, is hired by a friend of his to watch his wife and find out what she is doing in her afternoons when she gets out and does not seem to remember later in the evening what she has done. The man falls in love with the woman who is of course not the wife but a bait that is supposed to make that man witness her suicide, or rather the husband's wife's murder by the husband himself. But that he cannot know. And that love will survive that event, and even his second phase of disability, this time entirely mental since he feels guilty for having been unable to stop the woman when climbing in the tower of the Mission's church because of his acrophobia. And this love survives so well that he falls again when he sees the woman again in the hotel room where he had seen her when she was baiting him into the drama, though now he does not know it is her, he just thinks she looks like her. And she falls again herself in spite of all her attempts at resisting. And the next phase in the drama is going to lock up these two in total bleakness. But there I stop. You have to find out these superb details all by yourself. The second reason that the film is a masterpiece of global cinema is because it is a thriller that is so well sown up and patched up and glued up that even if you know every detail you will enjoy it just the same: it is a thriller that deserves to be watched a hundred times. The haute cinematographic couture of Hitchcock makes every single viewing more enjoyable than the previous one. Even, I think, you may see in the one hundredth viewing elements you had not seen before because the film, each frame of the film, each image of the film, is loaded with myriads of details that are all more significant than the others. And yet it does not look neither baroque nor rococo. It is just perfect and yet so rich that the perfection takes one hundred viewings to be seen. The third reason why this film is a jewel is that Hitchcock plays on height and stairs and staircases and climbing, and descending or ascending, as he so often, or should I say always, does. Here the stairs are coming naturally since we are in San Francisco and the streets are going up and down, and the houses are perched on slanting slopes, and the embankments have stairs to walk into the Bay, and naturally all buildings, churches, hotels, and whatever have stairs in the front and stairs in the back and stairs inside to go up to the upper floors. And the best is of course the staircase going to the top of the church tower in the Mission, and we will go up that winding staircase twice. And we will fly down that staircase twice in exactly the same way. And the whole film will be dominated by the long apparition of the Golden Gate Bridge, that bridge under which all fish bite into the bait that is thrown at them and are fished out of the foaming water into the burning furnace of the hell of a frying pan. The staircase metaphor is powerful in that film, and so natural, that we just wonder if at that moment Hitchcock has not been able to control his own derangement and we can maybe envisage the fact that he is not completely schizophrenic or psychotic, just psychedelic. The last thing I would like to say on that film is that Hitchcock is also a master of rhythm. He must have been a conductor in some other life of his and his temperament is definitely not perfect. He likes rhythmic variations and he can have scenes that seem so slow that they must last hours and some others that go in a wink of an eyelid. But it is neither haphazard nor unjustified nor in any way disturbing or boring. Every single pace, no matter what, is entirely ingrained in the plot and is part of the beauty of the film and our pleasure. We don't even have the freedom to breathe some when the rhythm is going down because then the dramatic tension goes up and vice versa. The denser the slower and the faster the least intense, but then the two together always give the maximum meaningful signification you can imagine.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines",Vertigo
76,zkonedog,The Master's Masterpiece,10,11 March 2017,"One of the few criticisms I have of Alfred Hitchcock's work is that, at times, the viewer is very aware they are watching a ""Hitchcock film"" and not all that focused on the plot/characters at hand. With ""Vertigo"", however, Hitchcock creates a masterpiece that transcends most of his other films and takes his directing to a whole new level.For a basic plot summary, ""Vertigo"" tells the story of Mr. Ferguson (James Stewart), a one-time detective whose fear of heights (or vertigo) now keeps him grounded. However, when a close friend hires Ferguson to track the whereabouts of his wife (played by Kim Novak), Ferguson is pulled into a web of intrigue and the paranormal far deeper than he could ever imagine, even to the point of having to finally confront the fear that cripples him inside.There is nothing I can nit-pick about this film. Period. It is truly a cinematic masterpiece that hits all the right buttons. The plot is infinitely engaging, and filled with enough twists and turns to keep you on the edge of your seat right up to the ending credits. The characters are well-acted and progress in interested ways as the reels keep spinning, making you actually care what happens to Stewart and Novak's characters. Then, of course, there is the direction from Hitch, who ties everything together perfectly with his mix of unique film techniques (using Technicolor in ways it had likely never been used before), interesting visual angles, and fast-paced, yet at the same time touching, plot angles.Like I said, within a few minutes (once Hitch makes his ubiquitous cameo), you'll never have that nagging feeling that this movie is only good because Hitch's name is attached to it. Instead, you'll be completely drawn into everything unfolding in front of you, perhaps even needing to be reminded at the end that it was a Hitchcock film in the first place.Thus, I consider ""Vertigo"" to be not only Hitchcock's best film, but also one of the best films of all-time. It just doesn't do anything wrong, and does oh so many things right.",Vertigo

His life changes when he accepts to watch a woman at the request of her husband, who suspects that his wife has been visited by a ghost. Directed by Alfred Hitchcock, has script Alec Coppel and Samuel A. Taylor, with the participation of James Stewart and Kim Novak.This film is considered by experts one of the best films ever made. I never understood why but, nevertheless, is one of Hitchcock's films that I most like to see. The script is very good, mixing love, obsession, loyalty, madness and mystery in an irresistible recipe that takes the seal of quality of one of the most brilliant masters of suspense in cinema. The ending is baffling. Technically impeccable, this film has an excellent picture, sound effects and a soundtrack where the emphasis is given to the opening theme that, in all fairness, became one of the most famous of Bernard Herrmann. The performance of the actors also deserves congratulations. Stewart shows why Hitchcock was so fond of working with him and Novak can perfectly be, at the same time, the damsel in distress and the femme fatale, who leads men to act without thinking.Essential for all Hitchcock fans, this film is a must-see for any lover of suspense and mystery.

79,TheMovieDiorama,"Vertigo is a masterful example in creatively blending mystery, suspense and romance.",8,3 June 2018,"Another film that is often regarded as ""the greatest movie of all time"" and many proclaiming ""Hitchcock's masterpiece"" which is quite a title considering his filmography. Whilst I don't think it's as good as some of his other work, it's definitely worthy of the eternal praise. A retired detective, who suffers with acrophobia, is hired to privately investigate a woman who is behaving strangely. It's told in a classic Hitchcock-ian narrative including several twists, taut suspense and a theme tune that will stay with you forever. Technically, this film is flawless. Hitchcock intricately utilises lighting to create perfect shadowing for shrouding ominous figures. The infamous use of his zooming technique to produce the vertigo effect was profound and increasingly heightened the suspense. Remembering that this was released back in 1958, it really has stood the test of time. Watching this for the first time now, I still felt the suspense and wonderment as if I was viewing this upon its initial release. And it's because of Hitchcock's directing techniques that allows his films to be invincible to time, Vertigo more than any others from his canon. A few famous scenes such as the kiss with a backdrop of crashing waves and the staircase climb shows how influential this romantic thriller is. Stewart, although slightly too old for this role, and Novak had decent chemistry with some fine acting. The twisted story does evoke themes of love and loss with some psychological details embedded. A man succumbing to the fixation of a woman, a prominent portrayal that only becomes more apparent after the plot twist. The pacing is very inconsistent, switching between rapid car following sequences to slow dull conversations that really don't add any necessary development to these characters, whilst occasionally running into some contrivances along the way. Is this Hitchcock's best? No. However it is a classic romance with masterful direction where the finest aspects come from the details, just not dizzyingly thrilling.",Vertigo

Really, I truly believe that this is Alfred Hitchock's true masterpiece.The plot is that complex and interesting that it's still influential. It never bores me and I always like to solve it whenever I feel agobiated by it's complexity. But in the end, the only important thing that counts is what Mr. Hitchcock thought.The plot has the necessary combination of suspense, psychological fear, and sexual tension. In every moment you will feel interested and invaded by a feeling of anxiety because of what's going to happen next. You will try to figure it out but.""Vertigo"" is a perfect example of how to craft a story of obsession based on a phobia, psychological fear, and supernatural explanations. Not everything that cannot be explained has to land in the supernatural field...Hitchock in my opinion delivers his best directional work. It's amazing how every single scene is carefully ambiented, flawless. His direction started an school and the way it generates a dynamic that helps the dialogs ""run"" and the important scenes is hard to explain.These scenes will live in your mind forever. The nightmare is amongst the most bizarre, creepy, moments. Some Buñuel reminders. The rooftop chasing at the beginning, the fall from the bell-tower, the visit to the cementery, the museum encounter, the restaurant, the first encounter between Scottie and Madeleine in the bar, Scotties POV when driving, etc. But special mention for the famous first kiss between the main characters. The one that takes place in the beach, now, that's a special moment in the history of cinema: the waves, the score, the moment, the dialog. I can only compare it with the kiss in ""Lost Highway"". Beautiful cinematic moments.""Vertigo"" is visually shocking. Actinng is great. The score is splendid. I can't believe such simple scores could add a special vibe to every scene. A memorable soundtrack. The Art Direction is mythic. Hitchcock throws a mix of colors that will stay in our subconscious. For example, why dressing a blonde woman in gray fashion? To make her look evil. Why use a blue shades color in the nightmare? Then having red flashes? Well, everything makes sense. The blue color used in night sequences was my favorite. Even in the ending it looks brilliant. The cinematography is just beautiful.

83,Movie_Muse_Reviews,The master at his most masterful,9,28 March 2009,"Initially a commercial and critical failure, ""Vertigo"" has settled in as one of Hitchcock's best films if not his masterpiece. Twisting a simple mystery into a psychological thriller, Hitchcock wraps the audience around his finger while Saul Bass' pioneering computer graphics and Bernard Herrmann's intensifying score apply the jewels to this crowning achievement.""Vertigo"" reunited Hitchcock with an ""aging"" James Stewart in the lead role as John ""Scottie"" Ferguson, a bachelor detective in San Francisco who's retired early after developing a severe acrophobia that causes bouts of vertigo. Yet old friend Gavin Elster (Tom Helmore) convinces him to privately take on a personal case – follow Elster's wife, Madeleine (Kim Novak), who has been acting strangely lately, as if possessed. Scottie begins tailing her, and becomes deeply wrapped up in the case, and Madeleine.As Scottie stalks Madeleine for answers, Hitchcock flexes his slow- build suspense muscles. Scottie quietly follows her all over the bay, and we observe from a distance, as he does, Madeleine's strange behavior. It's in this early portion that Samuel A. Taylor's screenplay (as loosely adapted by Alec Coppel from a novel by Pierre Boileau and Thomas Narcejac) dangles the suggestion of the supernatural, which Hitchcock giddily uses to his advantage. It gives him greater permission to play with color and lighting in different ways to further beguile the audience. Herrmann also takes this license to add more creepy elements to his score. He perfectly matches every tone Hitchcock sets in this fim.After a traumatic first act climax, ""Vertigo"" starts to transform. Scottie becomes a completely different character and we start to understand him as our protagonist less and less. Whereas Stewart's age was reportedly assigned much of the blame for the film's early failure, his talent and experience serves him well in the second act, which is where ""Vertigo"" goes from entertaining to brilliant. He's a man haunted and obsessed, and coming from the always likable Jimmy, this has a powerfully tormenting effect on the audience.Capped off by one of the best endings of all time – a finale that elevates every aspect of the movie, including its occasional weaknesses – ""Vertigo"" earns its spot in the top tier of Hitchcock films and all-time thrillers (and as the consensus best film of all time in the venerated ""Sight & Sound"" critics poll of 2012). Even if you're not quite that high on it, ""Vertigo"" easily stands as a showcase for a veteran auteur who has honed his craft and strengths to an exceptional level.~Steven CThanks for reading!

85,funkyfry,Fear of space,8,19 April 2009,"This one's been through the mill. I mean it, no joke -- every amateur and professional critic has had their crack at this film. If you piled up every interpretation, the film could mean just about anything and everything. You could also see it the way perhaps most of its original audience saw it, simply as a stylish suspense film with Jimmy Stewart playing a somewhat less savory hero than usual. But I'll go ahead and offer up what the film seems to say to me, without fear of repetition or hope of originality because there may simply be no uncharted territory where this film is concerned.Looking at the film's text first -- it should be admitted and recognized that this is in no way a ""mystery"" film. The whole idea of what happened is revealed halfway through, just in case it wasn't obvious enough for some of the dunces in the crowd. It's an out and out suspense film, and the object of the suspense is the Stewart character and how he will react to the moment when he recognizes that Madeleine and Judy are actually the same person. I would say that in terms of the dramatic functions of the film, it scores perhaps a B plus. Throwing dollops of makeup on Kim Novak and making her look like some kind of gypsy didn't make me think she was a different person, and wouldn't be likely to make this former detective who Stewart is playing either.However there is a lot of very compelling subtext here. There's the whole implication of dopplegangers, the idea of the fluidity of identity which is common to a lot of ""noir"" films. After all, it's impossible to talk about Madeleine and Judy being ""actually"" the same person without realizing the irony -- Judy was never Madeleine, but Scottie (Stewart) can never look at Judy without seeing that other person. In the end he is psychologically confused, throwing a tirade in the defense of a ""Madeleine"" who he never actually met and certainly never loved.There's this striking sense of a disconnect between past and present, intention and action, place and feeling. For example Hitchcock takes this lovers' stroll in Muir Woods among the redwood trees and somehow turns it into a scene of dread, as if the forest were haunted. There's absolutely no way for the characters to connect with that environment, and it produces a weird dissonance. Everywhere in the film, elements are being inappropriately juxtaposed: Marjorie's face on the portrait of the old Spanish lady, an older woman in a similar dress getting into Madeleine's car, the ""real"" Madeleine being thrown from the tower and mistaken by Scottie for his Madeleine, in the film's final moments a nun of all things being mistaken for the angel of death. The point is never that these things are not what they seem to be -- after all, which Madeleine was the ""real"" Madeleine, for Scottie I mean?",Vertigo
86,Vartiainen,"Intense study of compulsions, deception and lust",7,14 November 2018,"Vertigo was not a massive hit upon its release, but it has since become a cornerstone movie, one of the most beloved movies of its director, Alfred Hitchcock, and is nowadays regarded as one of the best movies of all time, especially by critics.And it certainly is a masterful film, even by Hitchcock's standards. It's also a very complex movie, even for him. Like in Psycho, the midway point of the film turns the whole arrangement on its head, and from thereon out it's almost like a completely new film. It's not anything I've ever seen before and quite frankly it left me feeling conflicted. On one hand the sudden reveal is such an unconventional way to tell a story that I appreciate it for its novelty and uniqueness. On the other hand I cannot help but think whether the twist would have had more impact if it had been revealed in a more traditional way.This dilemma also plagued Hitchcock himself, who reportedly wanted to change the twist into a more traditional form, but the producers told him to keep it. And in the end I'm glad they did, because it is such a novelty.Aside from that the film has its usual assortment of Hitchcock goodies. Master-level technique, powerhouse actors, intense atmosphere, great music, engaging storytelling. The whole nine yards and the kitchen sink to boot.Hitchcock's best film? Personally I'd say Psycho is just a bit better, but this is surely in the upper echelons. Well worth a watch.",Vertigo
87,GOWBTW,Very Intense!,9,8 July 2005,"This is not bad for a 50's movie. Especially if it's from Alfred Hitchcock. The beginning of the movie didn't look like anything from that era. I mean, the title and the background effects, it looked more scientific to any era. The affects of a phobia always impairs a person's work. And conquering them shouldn't be a problem. But if the person has ""Vertigo"", like the main character, conquering the fearing always have drawbacks. Scottie Fergerson(James Stewart) has vertigo and the fear of heights, that effected his work and cost a police officer's life. The guilt haunts him. Midge Woods(Barbara Bel Geddes, before DALLAS), is a designer and painter who seems to be the stronger characters in the movie. I thought is was funny when she painted the picture of the sitter with her likeness in it. For Scottie, he was not amused. SHAME ON YOU, SCOTTIE! However, the obsession made him too obsessed on finding out the mystery woman he's tailing. The woman(Kim Novak) was somehow just a pawn instead of the culprit when Scottie's friend hired him to look out. Guilt followed him again when she jumped off the roof, or so it seemed. The real pawn in the movie was Scottie himself. His own friend took advantage of his condition, and try to make him feel guilty again. Conquering the fear of heights is not easy, only if you let it persist. Like the old saying, The only thing you have to fear its fear itself. Rating 4 out of 5 stars.",Vertigo
88,FiendishDramaturgy,Hitchcock was the master of suspense.,9,1 April 2004,"Everything, the musical score, the performances, the story line, the dialog all felt right with this production. The attention to the finer details given by Hitchcock was what really set this movie to rights, but it did not hurt that there was real charisma there between Stewart and Novak.Stewart, who was Hitchcock's ideal for the ""average American guy,"" was nothing less than stellar in his Vertigo performance. His range of talent shows an outright absence of inhibitory characteristics. He goes from the warm yet aloof ""Scotty"" to the angry and downright mad ""Scotty"" in such a pure believability that his performance alone is one of the major factors in My assessment of this film as one of Hitchcock's very best.But where would Stewart's performance be without the full-figured and capable talents of his leading lady? Kim Novak was arguably one of the best talents of this film era. She was perfectly cast in the role of the mysterious yet earthy type lady of wealth who had a slight...problem. But, while her performance here was nothing but pure perfection, I must say I liked her character more in ""Bell, Book and Candle.""This story is one for the arm-chair psychiatrists out there; fraught with twists and turns, switch-backs and double-meanings, you could easily find yourself lost if you look away only for a moment. This is definitely a movie for the thinkers, and not the busy-bodies who enjoy watching a movie while doing other things. This story deserves nothing less than your full attention.While not considered Hitchcock's best work, or even among his best work, while he was still working, this endeavor has come to be known as such since his demise. To look at this now, so many years after its making and see it for the brilliance it was takes only a couple of hours and an adult attention span. He was so far ahead of his time, that his audiences just did not ""get"" the cruel irony of this attempt and as such, we nearly lost for all time one of the greatest masterpieces of suspense ever made. Only through the hard work and great dedication of those involved was this brilliant work restored. We are, indeed, fortunate as a society that this was even possible.IF YOU HAVE NOT WATCHED THIS MOVIE, THERE ARE MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD!!I loved the cruel irony of the ending. The fact that she had played him so freaking well only to die as her predecessor had. I thought that Hitchcock tried his best to use a fear common to many people; IE: the fear of heights, in order to draw his audience in. I enjoyed watching Hitchcock's demonstration of Scotty's slow mental spiral as everything began weighing on his subconscious; all the little details, all the tiny pieces that were swimming around in his head. It really looked as though he would snap, when in reality, he was quietly placing each piece into the necessary slot to make the picture come together for him. I also must comment on the use of the gray suit used by Hitchcock and worn by Kovak. It was used, IMO to make her all the more stunning in the evening gown she wore when Scotty first laid eyes on her.Everything else she wore after that was black, white or grey, to heighten the beauty of her in that one scene. Grey is usually a bad color for blonds. It washes them out and makes them look like they're wearing green pan for a black and white oldie. But Hitchcock did that on purpose as effect. Speaking of effects, the camera work here is simply stunning.That and the whole movie was nothing more than a parable teaching us to face our fears rather than surrender to them.

89,Turfseer,Hitchcock's hokum despite the wonderful musical score and cinematography,5,17 July 2021,"When Vertigo was first released in 1958, the reviews were lukewarm. Director Alfred Hitchcock speculated that casting the 49 year old Jimmy Stewart in the lead role of the former police detective John ""Scottie"" Ferguson was a mistake since he was 25 years older than the leading lady played by Kim Novak. One wonders why indeed Hitchcock did cast Stewart for the part since his character's romance with the much younger woman does not ring true at all.When we first meet Scottie he's involved in a rooftop chase of a criminal-due to his acrophobia (extreme fear of heights which results in vertigo) he becomes virtually paralyzed, the criminal escapes and a police officer falls to his death after trying to save the beleaguered detective. Scottie immediately resigns from the police force.Before the break into Act 2, Scottie visits his ex-girlfriend Midge (Barbara Bel Geddes), a commercial artist.. At least here (due to some snappy dialogue) we get a slight feel for both of their personalities but Midge as a character has little to do once the main plot takes hold.The break into Act 2 occurs when Scottie's old college friend, Gavin Elster (Tom Helmore), contacts him and asks if he'll tail his wife after she's exhibited very odd behavior. As Elster explains it, Madeline (his wife), seems to fall into a trance and comes to believe she's now the reincarnation of her great grandmother Carlotta, who died long ago in the 19th century. Scottie is naturally skeptical and scoffs at the idea of reincarnation despite Elster's insistence that his wife could be possessed. Somehow Scottie is talked into doing this job for someone he hasn't seen in years.Scottie learns from a local historian that Carlotta committed suicide after her wealthy husband cast her out and kept their child. When he starts tailing the woman he believes is Elster's wife, he finds her visiting various sites associated with her great grandmother-an art gallery which contains a portrait of the doomed Carlotta and her final resting place in a cemetery at Mission San Francisco de Asis. Scottie tails whom he believes is the woman to an old hotel where she mysteriously disappears.Now here's where the film really starts to go downhill. Inexplicably, the hard-nosed, skeptical detective suddenly comes to believe that Madeline has been possessed instead of trusting his gut instinct that she's an apparent nut job. He both feels sorry for her and falls in love with her within a few days without knowing anything about her. It's complete nonsense but Hitchcock asks us to buy this hokum (not only that-isn't Scottie being a tad unprofessional by going after a purported old friend's wife?) Scottie's love for Madeline grows to its apex when he saves her after she seemingly attempts suicide by jumping into the San Francisco Bay beneath the Golden Gate Bridge.That brings us to the midpoint where Scottie drives down with Madeline after she experiences a vision which turns out to be the Mission San Juan Bautista, Carlotta's childhood home. Again Scottie's acrophobia paralyzes him as Madeline seemingly runs up to the top of a bell tower and jumps off committing suicide. There's an inquest but no detective work shown in which the circumstances of the death are questioned. Then Scottie goes catatonic for a year in despair over Madeline's death and somehow recovers (but we never see how he pulls himself out of his stupor).In an absurd twist, Scottie spies a woman who reminds him of Madeline and somehow goes up to her apartment and convinces her to go out with him. Her name is Judy Barton (also played by Kim Novak). We soon learn that Barton was impersonating Madeline and aided Elster in a murder plot to kill the real Madeline. They counted on Scottie's acrophobia preventing him from climbing up the bell tower and witnessing Elster kill his wife and then throw her body off the tower to make it look like suicide (which is what transpired).Of course the plot makes no sense since Elster could have killed his wife without involving Scottie (how about a non-traceable poison?). Even more unbelievable is that he brings in Judy and subsequently fails to eliminate her as a confederate in his murderous scheme (couldn't she have easily blackmailed him?).Meanwhile once Scottie discovers Judy betrayed him, he doesn't immediately turn her into the police but instead gets the crazy idea that he'll redo the staged murder back down at the Mission in order to overcome his fear of heights once and for all. And what happens? He places Judy in a position where after a nun appears out of nowhere and startles her, she falls to her death from the same place where the suicide was staged.Vertigo is saved from complete oblivion by the magisterial Bernard Hermann score which you can never forget along with some beautiful scenes of 1950s San Francisco and some pretty interesting pre-digital special effects. Now completely restored to its original vibrant color, see Vertigo for the music and cinematography but please don't take the story at all seriously.",Vertigo

Vertigo is a love drama with a crime in the background, it is mind-twisting, but not so thrilling and exciting as the above mentioned. The long scenes without texts do no include or add horror.

And the role and place of music is so fitting and boosting the whole atmosphere.Luckily the film is not black-and-white, making it easier to watch and enjoy landscapes and fashion.Vertigo is highly admired by most critics, including Estonian ones, who have ranked it the best or second best film in the history of cinema.

Needless to say, nothing is as it seems. Hitchcock's direction is excellent as usual, the music moody, the cinematography is outstanding (especially the famous 'vertigo' scenes on the bell-tower stairs) and the plot is clever, albeit far-fetched (significant suspension of belief is require to buy into Ferguson's growing obsessions and his target's response). Jimmy Stewart is fine playing his standard stammering, low-key every-man but, at twice Novak's age, the 'magic' between them is a bit hard to swallow.

92,strong-122-478885,How Miss Deep Freeze (Novak) Became Scottie's Made-To-Order Barbie Doll,6,17 October 2011,"(Spoilers? Maybe) Hitchcock's ""Vertigo"" (?) - Strictly a case of possession-obsession - A deadly disturbing portrait of an All-American man, his mounting madness, and Judy's beauty parlor make-over from hell.OK. So, if the occasion offered itself, how would you expect an average American male to deal with the golden opportunity (like a gift from the gods) of being able to re-invent the woman of his dreams, who, already presumed dead, was also the ultimate love of his life? Well, if you were supposedly ""normal"" like Scottie Ferguson here in Vertigo, then you'd simply mold her, shape her, and torment her. Through the ruthlessness of intimidation, domination and humiliation you'd repeatedly trample on her feelings until she finally succumbed to your will and became a living replica of the frickin' Barbie doll of your warped fantasy. Yeah. That's what you'd do.Of all the Hitchcock films that I've seen over the years, I'd certainly rank Vertigo as my least favorite, by far. When you carefully look below the surface of things in this one, not only can you smell the reek of misogyny, but you also get the stink of one of the most vile and unpalatable character studies (of an apparently ""normal"" American male, in the form of Scottie Ferguson) that you are ever going to see.I personally found Scottie to be an even bigger monster than, say, Norman Bates from Hitchcock's ""Psycho"".I mean, at least we all knew well-enough that Norman wasn't ""normal"" and so that, in a sense, rendered the horrid acts that he committed as somewhat (Remember, I said ""somewhat"") acceptable.But, on the other hand, there was Scottie who was undoubtedly presented as being about the most ""normal"" male alive in America. And, yet, his final actions belied his normalcy, 'cause when it came to re-inventing Judy into his beloved Madeleine, Scottie clearly crossed well-over the fine line of sanity and stepped straight into a madness of the most obsessively dangerous in nature.Scottie's actions were so clearly that of a bona-fide psycho. So much so that, in a sense, he ended up killing Madeleine, not once, but twice. And if that ain't crazy, then I don't know what is.As slow-paced as Vertigo initially was at the start, all-in-all, it was a fairly intriguing Mystery/Thriller that worked fine up to about the half-way point. Then once Madeleine was ""killed"" for the first time, things quickly deteriorated into one of the most morbid and thoroughly tasteless obsessions involving a memory of the dead and a feeble attempt at its subsequent resurrection.Trivia note - Actor James Stewart, who played Scottie, was 50 at the time. Kim Novak, who played Madeleine/Judy, was only 25. From my point of view, this huge age gap alone didn't help matters much when trying to pass these 2 off as believable on-screen lovers.",Vertigo
93,PWNYCNY,This movie is great.,10,1 August 2014,"This movie features incredibly powerful acting by the two stars, James Stewart and Kim Novak. In fact, this story is so actor-driven that it is unlikely that with different actors the movie would have been as nearly as powerful. Stewart plays a character, Scotty, who is being cruelly manipulated by two people for ulterior purposes that become apparent only later in the movie. What drives the story forward is the interaction between Scotty and the woman, Madeleine, whose deviousness is only matched by her own emotional vulnerability. Emotions become confused as victim and manipulator become more involved. Besides being arguably James Stewart's most emotionally evocative performance, it propels the movie to a dramatic crescendo that is completely engaging. It is virtually impossible for an audience not to empathize with Scotty's emotional torment. Yet, what makes the movie even more provocative is the way in which the two characters are portrayed - as people with whom one can identify. Scotty and Madeleine are plausible characters. Without going into detail, suffice it that Kim Novak gives the best performance of her career. The cinematography is excellent. This is a great movie.",Vertigo
94,ackstasis,"""Give me your hand. Give me your hand""",9,7 July 2008,"John ""Scottie"" Ferguson has a fear of falling. As the detective dangles precariously from the unstable guttering of a tall building, he impulsively looks downwards to glimpse the distant ground seemingly rushing towards him, all the while paradoxically shifting further and further downwards to maximise his inevitable plummet. This optical effect, sometimes known as a ""contra-zoom,"" ""trombone zoom"" or even the ""Vertigo effect,"" was invented by Irmin Roberts, a Paramount second-unit cameraman, and Alfred's Hitchcock's use of the technique is pivotal to the success of 'Vertigo (1958),' the director's final collaboration with James Stewart. Human eyes interpret the relative dimensions of objects using a combination of size and perspective signals, and the simultaneous forward zoom / reverse track, which alters perspective while maintaining object size, instantly perplexes our eyesight, triggering sensory confusion and successfully mimicking the dizzying sensation of acrophobia. It may not be an incredibly subtle means of communicating Scottie's vertigo, but it's effective, and, particularly in the film's second half, Hitchcock employs a seamless combination of subtle and blatant film-making techniques to polish his landmark thriller.Just a few nights ago, I was fortunate enough to attend a double-bill cinema screening of Alfred Hitchcock's classic thrillers 'Rear Window (1954)' and 'Vertigo (1958),' both starring James Stewart and both among the finest pictures in the director's distinguished repertoire. Both films deal quite substantially with the notion of voyeurism, a topic further explored in Hitchcock's crowning masterpiece, 'Psycho (1960).' 'Rear Window' was the greater crowd-pleaser among the two, replete with gleefully-dark dialogue and a delicious murder mystery glimpsed through the rear window of Stewart's cluttered apartment. 'Vertigo' succeeds on distinctly-different terms: though rather lumbering and morose in comparison, the film is easily the Hitchcock's most intense thriller, with little of the playfully-black humour to be found in most of the director's acknowledged classics. This being my second viewing, it was interesting to note a film divided into two rather-incompatible halves, one a leisurely, borderline-supernatural ghost story, and the other a vivid exploration of loss and obsession. It's a curious combination, but it's also an altogether fascinating one.The film's opening half concerns acrophobic detective Scottie Ferguson (James Stewart), who has retired from the police force after his disability caused the death of a colleague. An old colleague, Gavin Elster (Tom Helmore), hires Scottie is surveil his wife Madelaine (Kim Novak), whom he tentatively suspects of having been inhabited by the spirit of a tragic-afflicted ancestress. Hitchcock confidently strings together a series of surveillance episodes, as Scottie tails Madelaine across San Francisco, observing her fixation with her nineteenth-century counterpart, culminating in an attempted suicide at the base of the Golden Gate Bridge. These sequences move at an unhurried pace, usually with extended periods of silence, underscored by Bernard Hermann's eerie soundtrack. However, to one with prior knowledge of the story's eventual conclusion, these comprehensive episodes of observation seem rather superfluous, a deception that exists as a trifling footnote to the film's primary concerns, of obsession and doomed passion. In any case, Scottie soon finds himself falling in love with Madelaine, and, when she is tragically wrenched from his grasp, his own grip on reality begins to falter.The film's second half, following Madelaine's apparent suicide, marks a crucial turning-point in both the story and our perception of the major characters. James Stewart, long considered the ""everyday man"" with his shy and polite demeanour, suddenly descends into darkened territory, emerging from his cocoon of self-pitying isolation only after attaining a streak of relief from the face of a passing stranger, Judy Barton (Kim Novak again). In a wretched bid to recapture the passion of his lost love, Scottie forcefully alters Judy's appearance to reconstruct Madelaine's image, and, in one of Hitchcock's all-time most powerful moments, the pair embrace in a hotel room, the camera spinning deliriously about them as their surroundings modify to momentarily evoke the memory of Scottie and Madelaine's final, blissful kiss. However, in choosing to construct a superficial duplicate of his love, Scottie has effectively thwarted any romantic future, and, when it is revealed that Judy and Madelaine were the very same person  the fabrication of an elaborate murder plot  he comes to realise that, not only had he initially ""fallen"" for an illusion, but his own self-made illusion was equally unviable, if not more so.",Vertigo

A troubling picture in many ways, from its complex, effectively unsettling filmmaking to the distressing changes undertaken by Ferguson in the third act. Hitchcock is, of course, a master of the craft and there's much to be learned from his efforts behind the camera (the now-infamous dolly zoom, tricks with lighting and foreshadowing, a casual pace that somehow never seems to grow stale) but also plenty to wonder about the man himself from the actions of his on-screen counterpart. In a Hitchcock film, it's nothing new for a visibly older gentleman to effortlessly draw the affections of a young blonde. Stewart's no exception in this film, pulling buxom Kim Novak (twenty-five years his junior), but his particular brand of obsession quickly grows dark and insistent, leading to some very squeamish scenes as he draws close to unraveling the conspiracy that's ensnared them both. Of course, Ferguson ultimately pays a price for this turn, but his greater judgment is never laid out on the screen. Rather, it's abruptly left to the scrutiny of the viewing audience, with more than a nudge to suggest he may not be completely without alibi. Expertly concocted and tragic from a bird's-eye perspective, but worrying from a more introspective one.",Vertigo
98,robfollower,Vertigo(1958),10,31 March 2021,"One of Jimmy Stewart's acting strength was his nervous demeanor and sense of angst he was brilliant IMO at this type of emotional depth through out his career. In this film he was able to show his sense of obsession and a lost soul/ star-crossed lover to perfection in my eyes that I do not think an other actor would have brought to the film. Secondly Kim Novak with very little theatrical training was sensational. She was a naturally shy, insecure woman which helped her in this film to bring a sense of otherworldly-ness to her role as Madeleine Elster. And as Judy Barton the girl from the wrong side of the tracks Kim was totally believable .. Novak in her Double role as Madeleine Elster /Judy Barton she was able to manifest the same sense of doom and vulnerability and as a lost soul/ star-crossed lover that I don't know if other actresses would have been able to convey as well as Kim. Because of the unparalleled writing and brilliant acting by Kim Novak , when Judy Barton finally get her poetic justice / comeuppance I believed every second of her portrayal of Kims character in the movie.

100,XweAponX,Magical journey into Fear,10,5 April 2008,"This is maybe the one time Hitch mixed almost-Fantasy elements with one of the most intense primal fears of mankind: The fear of falling, and built a highly suspenseful mystery around it.Along with the classic camera moves which depict James Stewart's ""vertigo"" (Ie, the elongation of one long shot, a camera move which is copied and used and ab-used by director after director: Example, in ""Lord of The Rings: Return Of The King"" Frodo looks into Shelob's Lair: The closer elements in the shot stay stationary, but the farther elements seem to move away from the camera. This is straight from Vertigo).This camera trick was possibly originated by Hitch and was used in Vertigo each time James Stewart looks into a Void area: Alfred Hitchcock's depiction of this is the best pictorial representation of fear of heights, mixed with fear of vast open spaces (However this phobia is classified)- This is hard to describe unless the experience is common, Hitchcock must have had the same fear, because his depiction of it matches my experience with it- And so, as Stewart looks down, from the top of the apartment building, and later in the film when he looks straight down the Bell Tower, that visual effect where the far away parts of the image stretch away from the camera view, this gives people who do not have acrophobia and the other related fears a visual representation of what a person with those fears goes through.And James Stewart's reactions to heights during the film are not too fantastic, especially the standing on the top step of a step-stool, it is not too ridiculous that he had a vertigo attack at that point. It is important for the viewer to understand how debilitating Vertigo and Acrophobia are when mixed together, and Hitch gives us a visual taste of these fears within minutes of the opening shots of the film when Stewart looks down and the world stretches.Hitch adds to the mix, a story which is almost time-travel or psychic... Kim Novak's character pulls the wool over not only Stewart's eyes, but ours as well. She is at her most convincing when she is looking at the tree rings and saying ""I was born around here, and I died here..."" We do not know anything but Stewart's fear of heights and his apparent guilt feelings at not being able to prevent an apparent tragedy from occurring... Just in case we do not really understand this Hitch added one of the most fantastic ""Dream Sequences"" of all his movies, which is rife with clues of all sorts as to what is really going on.And this dream sequence causes Vertigo to be visually stunning. Although Hitch uses all kinds of tricks during the film to add an unreality and eeriness to the story, Stewart's Dream centers his, and our, fears into the story, and also elements are added that hint to Stewart, and to us, that there is more going on here.When Stewart finds Judy Barton, as he becomes more and more obsessed with dressing her up as Madeline, the film becomes more and more removed from ""reality"" - especially when Stewart has an Epiphany, nothing in the shot has any substance but Madeline/Judy- The background becomes washed out, it is as if the only things that exist in our universe are James and Madeline/Judy.And as the film reaches denouement, this quality reverses until everything looks quite normal.There are too many aspects of this picture to evaluate: The musical score by Bernard Herrmann is one of his best and one of the most spiritual in any Hitchcock film.Also the best use of a city as location, San Francisco in the late 50's, and some of the landmarks shown are still there. A lot of the scenery included many places that I remember that endeared San Francisco to me.",Vertigo
101,estebangonzalez10,Another masterpiece from the Master,9,14 August 2014,"""Only one is a wanderer; two together are always going somewhere.""Hitchcock's Vertigo is considered by many critics as the best film ever, although this wasn't always the case considering that when it was released in 1958 it was poorly received by audiences and critics alike. So much so that it marked the last time that Hitchcock worked with James Stewart who he blamed for not attracting audiences any more due to his age. Unfortunately it was the last collaboration between the two, but they left us a rich legacy. Hitchcock also blamed Kim Novak's performance, but if he were alive today he would realize what a mistake those two claims were. First of all, I believe Kim Novak was enchanting in this film, she was the perfect femme fatale in this sort of film noir suspense thriller. She was attractive and hard to decipher. James Stweart was also great and once again is believable as this obsessed man who is following this mysterious women all over San Francisco. His fear of heights, which is a key part of this film, is also believable and thanks to Hitchcok's technique (now known as the Vertigo shot) those scenes worked extremely well. However, the best thing about Vertigo is the strange twists it takes and how it surprises us with the direction it takes half way through the film. It is hard to classify this film and it goes places you never imagine. This is what Hitchcock does best in his films and that is why he is considered as the Master of Suspense. The psychological elements are always present and everything is so masterfully crafted in this film that it is hard to break out of the enchanted atmosphere created here. The film's theme of obsession is probably why it is called a masterpiece considering no other film has explored this subject as well as Vertigo does. I personally prefer Rear Window, another collaboration between Stewart and Hitchcock, as his masterpiece although that film is more generic and easier to classify. In Rear Window Hitchcock explores voyeurism, in Vertigo a man's obsession over a mysterious woman who he feels attracted to. Actually there are two women who Stewart's character relates to in this film. Other than Madeleine (Kim Novak) who is the woman he is assigned to follow around the city he also shares a close friendship with Midge (played by Barbara Bel Geddes) his former love interest from his college days. Midge is an intelligent women and the perfect one for Scottie (James Stewart), but as he becomes more and more obsessed with Madeleine she begins to be sidelined. The only issue I had with this film involved some of the dialogue scenes between Scottie and Midge during the beginning of the film which served to set up the story and their background. It never felt authentic but it accomplished its purpose. Once Kim Novak enters in the picture and the theme of obsession kicks in the film really picks up and seduces the audience into its mysterious and eerie atmosphere. It's unpredictable, but I wouldn't say this thriller is as scary as Psycho, another Hitchcock film I would rank above Vertigo. I really loved this film despite some pacing issues during the beginning and midway through the story, but other than that I agree with the claims that this is a masterpiece and a must see for film lovers everywhere. Just like Citizen Kane this is a film that was ahead of its time and one who the contemporary audience wasn't ready to embrace.",Vertigo

106,barnabyrudge,Fine puzzler from Hitchcock.,9,7 August 2007,"The initial critical verdict of Vertigo was that it was not one of Alfred Hitchcock's better films. Time has turned it into his most analyzed and revisited movie and, in the eyes of many, his masterpiece. I still don't subscribe to the opinion that this is Hitchcock's greatest film (give me The Thirty Nine Steps, Foreign Correspondent or North By Northwest) but it is certainly a wonderfully absorbing mystery, and the original indifference that greeted the film from critics and audiences was totally unjust. It takes multiple viewings to fully appreciate what Hitchcock is up to in this movie - it is a sophisticated and multi-layered film that grows in stature the more times you view it.San Francisco cop John ""Scottie"" Ferguson (James Stewart) has a hair-raising escapade on a rooftop while chasing a robber. Thereafter, he develops vertigo (a fear of heights) and retires from the force. Some while later Scottie is contacted by his old friend Gavin Elster (Tom Helmore) who wants to hire him for a little unofficial private detective work. Elster is worried by his wife's increasingly outlandish behaviour - she seems to go into a dreamy state of mind and wanders off for hours on end without any explanation as to where she has been. Scottie's job is to tail her and learn where she goes. The mystery thickens when Scotties starts following Madeline Elster (Kim Novak).... the more he learns about her and her wanderings, the more it seems that she is possessed by the spirit of her long-deceased ancestor Carlotta Valdes. Eventually Scottie saves Madeline when she tries to drown herself in San Francisco Bay, and soon after they fall in love. But just as Scottie begins to make headway into her psychological problems, she kills herself by leaping from a bell tower. Scottie is left in a state of mental shock but later, following his release from hospital, he bumps into a woman named Judy (Novak again) who is the exact double of Madeline....Hitchcock generates a stunning air of mystery with Vertigo, coaxing brilliant performances from Stewart and Novak and using the location of San Francisco as almost a third leading ""character"" in his story. Stewart's obsession with Novak, and his descent into madness as he grieves over his inability to protect her, is brilliantly portrayed. As ever - in fact, more so than ever - Hitchcock keeps the audience off-balance with his disorientating camera work, ingenious plotting and atmospheric use of colour. Bernard Herrmann contributes a haunting score (his fourth for Hitchcock) that heightens the passion and suspense even further. The solution when it comes is extremely clever, and proves (as if proof is needed) that Hitchcock has a masterful touch when it comes to clever plot twists. The film's chief drawbacks, for me, are the excessively studied pacing in the first half, and the somewhat abrupt ending. On the whole, though, this is a superb film which is always a pleasure to come back to.",Vertigo
107,MissSimonetta,Obsession and death in dreamlike Technicolor,10,2 April 2015,"Vertigo (1958) has haunted me since I first saw it. Its dreamlike atmosphere and twisted tale of obsessive passion have made it a classic for all time. It's a film that gets better and richer with every viewing. You appreciate the first half of the film more as well as Novak's cool and later heartrending performance. And this is no doubt Hitchcock's best directorial work; he may have made more suspenseful and wittier films, but few get as poignant and creepy as Vertigo.People often complain that it's too slow and that James Stewart is miscast. On the first criticism, I say the film's slow pace is one of its biggest strengths; it gives us time to know the characters and appreciate the atmosphere, something Hollywood's modern blockbusters cannot manage since all viewers want is sensory overload and story whiplash.On the second criticism, I must disagree; Scottie is not a romantic lead. That he's played by a graying, older James Stewart makes his obsession with the young Madeline and the fantasy romance she represents all the more understandable and poignant; this is a man who desperately wants out of his dull, everyday world and is willing to go dangerously over the edge to possess a woman too good to be true. That this is classic Hollywood everyman James Stewart playing this disturbed character adds a level of creepiness to the character too.A true classic, an essential piece of cinema.",Vertigo
108,dwpollar,Classic Hitchcock thriller with excellent performances...,9,28 October 2001,"1st watched 10/28/2001 - 9 out of 10(Dir-Alfred Hitchcock): *Spoilers*Classic Hitchcock thriller with excellent performances by Jimmie Stewart and Kim Novak.  This movie is a unique experience to watch because as a viewer you are in Stewart's shoes until the reality of the situation is revealed to you by Hitchcock and of course Stewart is the kind of star that we're always routing for(so we're hoping for the best till the very end).  Guess what? We don't exactly get what we're hoping for, and that's what makes this is a special film in my eyes.  It goes against the grain by putting likeable characters who actually don't come out on the good side.  This makes for a horrible viewing experience in some people's eyes, but to me it throws a twist into what should be expected from these viewing experiences(Now when I see Jimmie Stewart, I don't always expect him to get the girl -- in a way). The movie is technically well done as well with even some animation thrown in for a dream sequence.  All in all I believe this is one of the (if not the best) Hitchcock movie which has influenced many future movies by other directors and will probably continue to influence more.  Bravo!!",Vertigo

113,slokes,Falling In Love...Or Just Falling?,9,18 October 2004,"Alfred Hitchcock made a career movie with ""Vertigo,"" one of several career movies of his, but maybe the most enduring. On the surface, it's a love story with a mystery, bright and shiny, maybe his most sumptuous feast of the senses. But it has a cold heart.James Stewart is the key to the film. I think a lot of people misjudge the film by misjudging his character, police detective John ""Scotty"" Ferguson. They see him and see the guy who played amiable dipso Elwood P. Dowd in ""Harvey"" or noble Mr. Smith or George Bailey. The secret of Scotty is he's no nice guy, though. He's more than a bit of a heel, a hard and greedy man eminently deserving of the roasting he gets in Henry Jones' postmortem. Watch Stewart in Hitchcock's ""Rope"" or the unjustly overlooked ""Carbine Williams,"" and you see the hardness Hitchcock was after, and got, from his lead here.Scotty does a lot of mean things in ""Vertigo,"" actions that feed his illness and lead to his doom. The character of Midge, subtly portrayed by Barbara Bel Geddes, is a key for understanding this. His casual stoking early on of Midge's flames of unreturned desire, especially when viewed in retrospect, burns through their happy banter and demonstrates how miserable a man he is, nowhere more brilliantly or ruthlessly than when he cuts her off from his life over a silly gag. Watch ""Vertigo"" more than once, and you may find yourself hating the guy as much as I do. But you still follow his path of doom with total sympathy; because of the elegant, enveloping way Hitchcock draws you into this world of passion, cut off from all bounds of propriety, even space and time.If Scotty was played by anyone other than Stewart, it's hard to imagine ""Vertigo"" packing the punch it does. You wouldn't have enough tolerance for the character to stick with his story. In its own day, ""Vertigo"" was a bit of a misfire, probably because audiences felt alienation from the Stewart image they were accustomed to. Yet now viewed from a decent remove, you get more of what Hitchcock was after, and respond to it better.Still, it's easy to understand people not liking ""Vertigo"" the first time they see it. At least that's true with me. I didn't like ""Vertigo"" the first time I saw it. Here's what helps you find the right handle. Fall in love with the wrong person. Become bitterly disappointed. See the one that you loved in the face of passersby, in odd places, and in your dreams. Then you begin to get it. Life is a series of hellos and goodbyes, as Billy Joel once sang, and trying to hold on too long is a recipe for self-inflicted pain.Talking too much about ""Vertigo"" is not a good idea. There's too many obvious spoilers in recounting the plot of the film, in explaining why Kim Novak is so flat-out stupendous in her performance, and how you are left feeling by film's end. ""Vertigo"" is a uniquely personal film, not only for Hitchcock, but for a broad array of viewers who like me have latched onto its tragic story.That's not to say it's perfect. There's a murder mystery wrapped up in ""Vertigo,"" and all the pieces don't exactly fit when you think about them later. Hitchcock called it ""icebox talk,"" something to leave the viewer pondering after the film was over, but maybe he left a few more loose ends than he should have this time around.Still, what ""Vertigo"" is after is not making sense but magic, and it succeeds wonderfully, nowhere more so then when it bends the laws of reality. Take the moment when the bookstore owner tells the sad tale of Carlotta Valdez while the lights of the room around him dim in eerie, unnatural sympathy. Or the way the flowers in the shop Madeleine visits seem to glow in unearthly splendor as Ferguson, his eyes glowing strangely too, spies on his prey.You may not like this film the first time you see it, but if you are left disturbed and uneasy from the experience, you owe it to yourself to see it again. ""Vertigo"" is a film that keeps on giving, with all the power and mystery of unrequited love, but unlike most forms of infatuation, this film has a way of returning the ardor with which it is held. Utterly timeless.",Vertigo

115,EUyeshima,Obsession as Grand Melodrama in Hitchcock's Most Hypnotic Work,10,18 February 2006,"This legendary 1958 masterwork from Alfred Hitchcock plays like grand Baroque opera full of exaggerated character motivations and preposterous plot turns, yet it is one of the most consistently involving of his impressive canon of films perhaps because he takes an unsavory subject, sexual obsession, and shapes around it a remarkably perceptive character-driven mystery thriller. Co-written with intricacy by Alec Coppel and Samuel A. Taylor, the tightly drawn story focuses on John ""Scottie"" Ferguson, a plainclothes detective who quits the police force after his partner dies during a rooftop chase where Ferguson is debilitated by a severe case of acrophobia. An old college acquaintance, now a shipping tycoon, convinces the now-retired Ferguson to follow his disturbed, potentially suicidal wife Madeleine, and thus begins Ferguson's first obsession.The film twists and turns until her apparent death from a fall from the San Juan Batista mission church steeple. This is where Hitchcock does something quite audacious. Suffering from this unexpected tragedy, the hero of the movie becomes a darker character we are suddenly not sure about. By fate back in San Francisco, Ferguson meets a shopgirl named Judy who bears enough of a physical resemblance to Madeleine for him to stalk her and force her to change her appearance to look like his lost love. At first, it feels rather necrophilic if not downright deranged for Ferguson to act on his obsession of a dead woman, but regardless, a final twist makes the love between Ferguson and Judy impossible to endure. Hitchcock lends a deepening sense of emotionalism to the maddening but addictive spirals of the plot which ultimately makes the film's title even more resonant than the medical condition Ferguson has.Casting is crucial to making the storyline relevant to a viewer much less credible. In a nice change-of-pace, James Stewart makes Ferguson's obsession palpable, and his everyman demeanor takes on a convincing sinister edge, even though his natural affability sneaks through effectively as a counterbalance. In what remains a most underrated performance, Kim Novak manages to play her dual roles with a surprising lack of affectation, from the cool mystique of Madeleine to the desperate eagerness of Judy. Hitchcock uses Novak's natural detachment as an actress to the movie's advantage, as I doubt the more versatile Grace Kelly could have played at least the Judy part as well. Barbara Bel Geddes has precious few scenes in the relatively thankless role of Midge, Ferguson's sometime girlfriend. The San Francisco locations are used to great advantage - the Palace of Fine Arts, the Palace of the Legion of Honor, Fort Point, the now-defunct Ernie's restaurant, the Podesta Baldocchi flower shop, the cemetery at Mission Dolores - all shot in lustrous detail by Robert Burks. Bernard Herrmann contributes one of his great scores to complement the pacing and atmosphere of the mystery and suspense.The DVD has the splendid 1996 restoration which captures all the visual and aural splendor of the film. It also includes an alternative commentary track that features Novak, restorers Robert Harris and James Katz, Hitchcock's daughter Patricia and most interestingly, associate producer Herbert Coleman who is full of anecdotes. Harris and Katz figure prominently in an interesting 1997 half-hour documentary on the original production and restoration process. There have been many knock-offs - including Brian DePalma's derivative 1976 ""Obsession"", Kenneth Branagh's blackly humorous 1991 ""Dead Again"" and most recently, Jun Ichikawa's coldly antiseptic 2005 ""Tony Takitani"" - but this is most definitely the one to experience.",Vertigo
116,aharmas,"The Perfect Valentine, with a Very Turbulent Twist",10,15 June 2007,"Many of the scenes in ""Vertigo"" rely on the fabulous and wistful score that accentuates the various stages of development in the story. We become intrinsically involved with the lives of the characters as the orchestra envelopes us into the role of the voyeur that can't believe what he is witnessing. We understand where the obsession comes from. It is impossible to gauge the intensity of the power with which it has taken over our hero's life.Kim Novak is deadly perfect as the siren who seduces Jimmy Stewart's detective. She is as cold and alluring in her original portrayal of the suicidal heiress. Eventually she wins us over as the desperate and repentful woman who must surrender her independence to achieve her dreams/nightmares. The film begins as a detective story that goes wrong because suddenly the expectations go awry. Nothing on the screen is at is started. Our hero is an obsessed necrophiliac. The object of his desire is a lovely, disturbed woman, who is as insecure as anything to ever show up in a 50's movie. Still, Novak makes her lovely, mysterious, alluring, carnal, spiritually flawed, and in the end, the perfect victim.The biggest surprise of the movie is Stewart, playing a very disturbed character, with more problems that anyone should be able to survive. The film is a lovely valentine because in spite of the dark themes it explores, it shows us how little controls human really have over their fate and their choices. Herrman's score is the soul of the film, and Hitchcock's direction is as masterful as ever, probably the best he ever did.""Vertigo"" deserves its ranking among the finest films ever made. It is sweet and passionate, pure and rank, a masterful portrayal of blooming love and its decaying ends.",Vertigo

118,Jonny_Numb,So...where is the masterpiece I've heard so much about?,3,1 July 2006,"(Spoilers. My advice: read them and save 2 hours of your life.) I watched ""North by Northwest"" not too long ago, and found it to be a grueling chore; Hitchcock spun a continually jerky screenplay into an equally jerky, emotionless film. Cary Grant was completely miscast as the wisecracking wrongfully accused, and James Mason was utterly wasted in the role of the heavy. I picked up ""Vertigo"" based on the recommendation of a coworker, and while I went in aware of the film's highly-esteemed reputation, I tried not to let that influence my opinion.Turns out it wasn't a problem at all. For all its glowing praises, ""Vertigo"" is an incredible bore, actually a more grueling view than ""North by Northwest."" Once again, Hitchcock spins a convoluted--and, quite frankly, uninvolving--plot well past its welcome: retired P.I. Jimmy Stewart (warbling more than a turkey) is enlisted by a wealthy industrialist to find out what's eating his eerily remote wife (Kim Novak); when said wife commits suicide, Jimmy spies a female who is a dead ringer for the deceased; he becomes involved with the doppleganger, only to discover that she is the same woman, who was the co-conspirator/lover in the industrialist's scheme to off his wife. The End.""Vertigo"" would have been better titled ""Slow-Go,"" as it stretches the very fabric of celluloid to its breaking point--the whole story feels padded, which wouldn't be so bad if the dialog were interesting and the characters not so lethargic. But Stewart's neurotic, obsessive detective had me nodding less than an hour in, and Novak's drugged delivery didn't help, either. That the duo possess no chemistry is the ultimate kiss of death for this pseudo-noir.The film only comes to life when Hitchcock shows off his then-innovative (now dated) technical flourishes, as illustrated in the disorienting 'vertigo' POV shots, and an out-of-the-blue dream sequence that doesn't serve any discernible plot function, but is interesting to watch.Overall, though, ""Vertigo"" is uninteresting to the point of tedium. As of late, I have been wondering whether Hitchcock was really all he was cracked up to be (I love ""Psycho"" and ""Frenzy""), or if, like Stanley Kubrick, he merely caught the eye of those pretentious lovers of style and technique, and spun a legacy from it...",Vertigo
119,Steffi_P,"""That is a matter between him and his own conscience""",10,23 November 2006,"Perhaps the most significant thing about this masterpiece from Alfred Hitchcock is that it is the film which broke Jimmy Stewart. Hitchcock took the ultimate nice guy, the honest, likable everyman of heart-warming Frank Capra romantic comedies and gradually turned him into an obsessive, mentally deranged control freak. A very deliberate stroke of genius in casting, but it is only one of many things that make this an incredible picture.Hitchcock's films are not known for their visual style. There was always the occasional attention grabbing close-up or freakish angle, but by and large he made his impact through pacing, plotting and expressionist arrangement. Vertigo is the exception  it really is a feast for the eyes. Most important are the colours, a fact which Hitchcock establishes right from the start with the kaleidoscopic opening credit sequence. He shows full mastery of Technicolor, comparable to the films of Michael Powell. Each location has its own colour scheme  neutral light browns for Midge's flat, traffic-light red for Ernie's restaurant, glowing green for the hotel where Judy stays. The green motif  here symbolising rebirth  crops up again and again in relation to Madeleine and Judy. Even the water she attempts to drown herself in has a greenish sheen to it.One thing that characterises Hitchcock's films is that, no matter how complicated the plot is, it is conveyed in a way that the film can be understood in a single viewing. You're never left wondering who some minor character was supposed to be or confused about some character's motivation. Vertigo is no exception, although it is one of the most complex and twisting plots of any Hitchcock picture. He dispenses with his trademark suspense (with the exception of the red-herring opening scene, Scotty is never actually placed in any danger) and plunges into the depths of his psychological streak. It is perhaps also Hitch's only genuine film noir, although it is rarely referenced as such (probably because noirs are typically in black and white). It does however have all the typical noir elements  a femme fatale who leads the hero astray, a kind but plain woman who loves him and, in between the two, an upstanding, well-meaning lead man whose life unravels because of his own faults.Vertigo is also as abstract as Hitchcock's early Fritz Lang-inspired efforts, but here done infused with the more confident later Hitchcock style. There are colour filters, dream-like cinematography (particularly good in the sequoia forest sequence), the famous zooming-in, dollying-out technique and an animated dream sequence. The dazzling imagery could be seen as prefiguring the influence of psychedelia a decade later, although really it is perhaps only the logical extension of the German Expressionist style. It's only really an updated version of the superimposing of images and casting of shadows in films by Fritz Lang and FW Murnau. For this reason Hitchcock could be called one of the truest heirs of the German Expressionist movement, and not just for the psychological angle.It's an amazing accomplishment of both lead actors that they are both essentially playing two different characters each. James Stewart starts off in his comfortable, familiar friendly type that he is used to playing, but by the end of the picture he has transformed into an cruel, obsessive monster. Kim Novak also plays two very different roles as the prim, icy Madeleine and the worldly and down-to-earth Judy. Barbara Bel Geddes gives a great supporting role as Midge.Another thing worth a mention is Bernard Hermann's score. I'm not a big fan of Hermann, but I'd say this is his best score for Hitchcock. He matches the action perfectly. There are several long sections without dialogue, and here the music plays a similar role to a silent film score. In fact the timing of every element in the film is spot on  one example being a wave crashing on the shore in the background when Scotty and Madeleine first kiss.The first time I saw Vertigo I was hooked, right from the opening moments to the final shot. While its power to hold me has diminished somewhat over repeated viewings (a weakness of all Hitchcock films, the flipside to their being instantly enjoyable) it still looks amazing and it can still send shivers down my spine. It's an incredible achievement.",Vertigo
120,ShootingShark,Mesmerising Thriller Of Fearful Detective Falling For The Wrong Woman,8,22 February 2011,"Scottie Ferguson retires from the police force because of an acute fear of heights. He is hired by an old acquaintance, Gavin Elster, to follow Elster's wife Madeleine, who seems to be losing her mind, as if she is possessed by some other spirit. As he becomes more involved in her plight, Scottie finds himself falling in love with this strange woman, who may not be all she seems ...Vertigo is a masterpiece; one of Hitchcock's most stylish, daring, inventive and intriguing pictures. Technically, it is just dazzling, filled with astonishing moments, extraordinarily evocative locations, and masterful audience manipulation. But I think it's thematically where it really scores - it's one of those movies you can talk about for hours afterwards, interpret a dozen different ways, and has almost too many fascinating ideas going on. It also breaks so many rules it's hard to believe it's a mainstream Hollywood studio picture - the leading lady doesn't speak for forty-five minutes, the leading man is obsessed with her almost to the point of necrophilia, the clever trick-ending is given away half-an-hour before it finishes, and it concludes with perhaps the most horribly abrupt tragedy in the history of cinema. It's also a film which demands repeat viewings from the true movie-hound, not least of all to try to decipher what it means - all those shots of Novak reflected in mirrors, the moment in the woods where she seems to just disappear, her absence from the guest house when we've seen her at the window, the scene at Pebble Beach where she pleads, ""I'm not mad""(eleine), the terrifying dream sequence where Carlotta seems to be haunting Scottie. Also, what is Jimmy Stewart, the all-American good guy, doing here ? Scottie is a washed-up coward, he covets other people's wives, he's self-obsessed, he ignores the one person who really loves him (Midge) - he really is a sicko and yet he's the hero !? I like to compare him (and the movie) to Norman Bates in Psycho, who of course is a monster, but is also kind of sweet, bashful, well-intentioned and humble, all qualities completely lacking in Scottie. This is not to say Stewart is bad casting - on the contrary, it's brilliant, and he's terrific in the part as he gradually descends into complete madness. Novak is equally stunning, easily the most enigmatic of Hitchcock's Blonde M's, giving a riveting performance of someone giving a riveting performance, constantly teasing us with little cracks in the facade of a woman we don't really understand. Hitchcock and his frequent collaborator, cameraman Robert Burks, photograph the actors with extraordinary intensity, but also use the glamorous San Francisco locations to enormous atmospheric effect; the quiet moments at the California Palace Of The Legion Of Honor, the crucial moment at the Presidio when Novak falls into the bay, the eerie possession scene in Big Basin Redwoods State Park (""Here I was born, and there I died. It was only a moment for you, you took no notice ... "") and the unforgettable sequences at the beautiful Mission San Juan Bautista. Hitchcock creates a timeless sense of place, of characters moving across landscapes which are almost a part of the dreamlike story in of themselves. The final element in the movie's rich tapestry is the tremendous horror/romantic score by Bernard Herrmann. Right from the very first image of the woman's lips in closeup, Herrmann's music is working to disconcert us, unnerve us, pulling us into an abyss of deceit and artifice. The music sweeps and dives, dizzying us along with Scottie, driving us along to an inexorable fate we don't want to consider. The power of movie music is something extraordinary and this is one of the finest examples of it; if you don't believe me, watch the nightmare sequence with the sound turned down and then watch it again with the music - you'll be converted. Nicely scripted by Alec Coppel and Samuel Taylor, from the book D'Entre Les Morts by noted French crime writers Pierre Boileau and Thomas Narcejac (who also penned the novel on which Les Diaboliques is based). Hitch of course made lots of very good films, but a handful of them are simply stratospheric, and this is one of those. Unmissable.",Vertigo

123,Spondonman,Heady stuff,8,4 August 2012,"I thought I'd sit down and watch the best film ever made but I picked this one instead. And what a wonderfully silly film it still is too! It's not the type of film I can watch too often, but once I reach a certain point I always find myself completely immersed in its dreamlike ambiguities. It was a superb creation from a master storyteller, Alfred Hitchcock knew his craft so perfectly after over 30 years in the business that it's hardly surprising that Vertigo still delights people today. Whether it's a better film than Citizen Kane though is perhaps a question to leave to the experts  to get wrong.Ex-police detective James Stewart is hired by old friend to follow and make sure his wife Kim Novak is alright as she doesn't appear to be alright in the head. Stewart falls in love with Novak, and later vice versa. And literally head over heels too! She apparently commits suicide with vertigo-struck Stewart unable to prevent her. But be warned: what begins improbably continues implausibly and climaxes almost impossibly. I've seen it quite a few times since it was first on UK TV in the '80's (copyright problems held it and some other Hitchcock films off the box till then) but once seen and you know who's leading who up the garden path it can lose a bit of its power. It's slightly unsettling watching Stewart as a middle-aged stalker then as a perceived pervert, but Novak soon puts minds at rest in the pivotal scene when she's trying to write her confession. As with a few other films the music actually makes it much better – Bernard Herrmann's score is actually essential to the enjoyment of this; it's insistent and weaves in and out revolving around everything in here. Favourite bit: the love scene of course, I just hope you hear it in stereo!Nice acting (Stewart's best performance outside of It's A Wonderful Life), memorable photogenic locations, lovely lilting music, grippingly mad story, tremendous production values and direction – who could ask for anything more? One of the best films ever made depending on the size of the list, mine would probably have at least 100 titles in it to be included.",Vertigo
124,davidmvining,Falling for an Idol,10,11 August 2020,"From the opening credits, it's easy to tell that there's something darker and weirder about this journey into obsession and control from Hitchcock. The music from Bernard Hermann is haunting. The neon spirals spinning against a black background are a visual representation of the trippy journey to come. And then we get a prologue where we watch our main character Scottie running along rooftops until he's clinging for his life and another policeman falls to his death trying to help him. Thinking back over Hitchcock's other movies of this vein (Notorious, Spellbound, and Rope in particular), credit sequences were lighter, opening scenes were less heavy and brighter (even in Rope, the murder happens quickly and then it begins to lighten up visually), and there were far fewer ominous tones bounding about. I don't know what it was about the script based on the novel D'entre Les Morts that got Hitchcock to push his opening this far in a new direction, but I think it works fantastically at setting the scene.Vertigo was in a series of films Hitchcock was making where he was trying to use his Hollywood cache to expand what kinds of films he could make. From the cinema verité aesthetics and narrative of The Wrong Man back to the one-shot technique of Rope, Hitchcock was trying to move beyond the term Hitchcockian and make movies that simply interested him. Vertigo, despite its reputation as his best movie (if you believe the Sight & Sound poll) and his most emblematic, it actually feels like it's missing a few of the basic elements that make a movie Hitchcockian. There's no wrong man. There's no chase. It's not a breakneck thriller like The 39 Steps or North by Northwest. There's no real MacGuffin. It's a dramatic mystery, more in line with Rebecca than almost anything else he made.There are definitely other common elements at play, for sure. The blonde Madeleine fits in rather well with his other blondes, though she's a deeper, more sympathetic character than most. There's voyeurism both explicit and implicit (Madeleine got naked into Scottie's bed somehow). It's not out there completely in terms of what made Hitchcock movies Hitchcockian, but it does seem a step removed.Anyway, I love it. It's such a great film with a pair of main characters that both get incredibly sympathetic treatments. Scottie is a former policeman with a fear of heights that leads to vertigo who gets hired by an old college chum, Gavin, to follow his wife, Madeleine, who acts as though she's possessed by the spirit of a low born woman raised to elegance and then discarded by a powerful Californian a hundred years before. What makes this plot interesting, I think, is that Scottie never falls into the belief of the possession. Up until the moment he loses Madeleine, he's trying to appeal to her reason and past experiences in her own life, not the life of a long dead woman. What ends up making the romance work between Scottie and Madeleine is that Madeleine isn't a real woman, but an ideal created by Gavin to appeal to Scottie. On the other end, the woman playing Madeleine, Judy, ends up falling for Scottie because of something she says later, that she's been pursued by many men, heard many lines, and implies that she's only had bad experiences with men. Scottie, who comes to her genuinely and wanting to help her without taking advantage of her is something she's never experienced before.The tragedy of the film is that the two would never have come together if it hadn't been for Gavin's plot to kill his own wife, but that same plot is what separates them in the end. When Scottie finds Judy, he can't help but fall in love with what Judy could be rather than who she is. The plot continues to be destructive long after it's ended because Scottie can't let go of the woman who never existed even as the actual woman he fell in love with stands in front of him, hoping against hope that he'll see her instead of the fantasy, but because she loves him, she lets him transform her back into the fantasy. The hurt that Scottie feels at having been lied to is deep, but so is the hurt that Judy feels for receiving nothing back from the man she loves for who she is herself. She knows she's little more than an object to him, but she can't let it go.There's a dream sequence late in the film that recalls, to a certain extent, the dream sequence in Spellbound, but the effectiveness of the two is a marked contrast. In Spellbound, the basic actions of what we're seeing get explained in voiceover along with an explanation. In Vertigo, it comes at Scottie's low point, presents its series of images, and never gets mentioned again. It's a cinematic demonstration of Scottie's emotional state at that point, and the unnatural way the images are put together, along with the haunting score by Hermann, heighten the moment for the audience. The former was interesting visually but used poorly while the latter is both great to look at and serves a strong purpose in the story.Now, reading up a bit on the film, I discovered that there was one particular editing fight that broke out between Hitchcock, his regular editor George Tomasini, and the studio where Tomasini and the studio wanted to keep in a scene late in the film where Judy writes a letter to Scottie admitting her involvement in the plot that she never sends. Hitchcock wanted it cut, but he lost the argument and kept it in. Having read that before I rewatched the film, the scene stood out a bit and I began thinking of what the movie would be without it, and I think it would have worked better. We can see Judy's emotional troubles with becoming another woman for Scottie, but I don't think we need the explicit reveal that early. The final reveal with the necklace and the admission at the church tower in the final moments of the film would act as confirmation of what the audience had begun to suspect, helping to build the mystery without, I think, detracting from Judy's emotional fragility and depth.There's an extra push in this film emotionally and artistically that sets it atop most of Hitchcock's filmography. In particular, it's his best looking film. The colors are so deep and vibrant, especially the restaurant Eddie's with its deep red walls contrasting with the dull grey of Scottie's suit and the pop of green from Madeleine's scarf. The hotel room where Judy finally fully becomes Madeleine is the stand out, though. The green of the exterior sign of the hotel is Madeleine's color (she wears green the first time we see her, her car is green, etc.) and as Judy walks out of the bathroom fully transformed, she's bathed in a green glow that has a literal explanation and a metaphorical one (the manifestation of a fantasy). The use of color is so precise in Vertigo and so wonderful to look at, that it's such a sumptuous visual treat to simply look at.I still prefer Notorious by a smidge, but Vertigo is a great film. It's great to look at, it's emotionally involving, and the mystery ends up playing second fiddle to the emotional arcs of the characters on multiple viewings. The movie actually gets better on rewatches because the characters are so well built that while Scottie is going through his end of the mystery that we already know, he's not just following breadcrumbs. He's building an ideal that carries him through the film to the end. Vertigo really is one of Hitchcock's best films.",Vertigo
125,Spleen,"DUM-dum-dum DEE-dee-dee, DUM-dum-dum DEE-dee-dee",9,17 December 1999,"`Vertigo' is Hitchcock's first deeply odd film.  There would be two more: `The Birds' (1963) and `Marnie' (1964).  After that he returned to the straight-forward, sane plots of his youth.  (`Frenzy' (1972), for instance, is yet another version - by my count, the fifth - of `The 39 Steps'.)`Rope' was filmed all in one continuous shot, and `Spellbound' had dream sequences designed by Salvador Dali, but that's not the kind of thing I mean.  It's the moral outlook of `Vertigo' that's odd.  `OF COURSE Scottie will behave in this fashion,' Hitchcock seems to be saying.  `Who wouldn't?' I don't know why I'm so willing to play along: maybe it's the surreal way San Fancisco is shot so that it appears to be a city not of this Earth, maybe the score by Bernard Herrmann.  (It's easily and beyond doubt Herrmann's best Hitchcock score).  Part of the reason I so enjoy following a film that is, objectively speaking, so slow, surely has to do with the fact that Scottie's motivation is explained, but it's never explained in advance. An air of suspense permeates the picture without being concentrated in any one part.I find it hard to understand the people who prefer `North by Northwest'.  IF you're a fan of the American Hitchcock - I'm an Anglophile, myself - then this is surely the apotheosis, the perfect expression of everything Hitchcock had been reaching towards in America.  This is a film GROWN in America, not a transplant from foreign soil the way `North by Northwest' is. (Yes, I know it's based on something French, but that's beside the point: it's the place where Hitchcock first makes the transfer to celluloid that's important.)  Preferring `Rear Window' or `Psycho', on the other hand: THAT I could understand.To conclude with a gauche display of star-worship, Kim Novak is surely Hitchcock's most attractive ever female lead - and she plays an interesting character, too, which is more than can be said for most of Hitchcock's actresses.  If Scottie must become obsessed to the point of madness with anyone, let it be her.  Sorry, Midge, but that's what you're up against.",Vertigo
126,Amyth47,Review # 300 : VERTIGO - HITCHCOCK'S GREATEST.,10,6 January 2019,"My Rating : 10/10 ♠ MASTERPIECE ♠RUNNING TIME : 127 MINS
BUDGET : $2.5 MIL
BOX OFFICE : $3.2 MILTRIVIA -Hitchcock spent years trying to recreate the psychological state of dizziness or vertigo on film. He finally achieved it by combining a forward zoom with a reverse tracking shot. The effect is used several times in the film: in the opening sequence, when the officer falls from the roof of the building; and later, in the view down the mission stairwell (a shot that cost $19,000 for a mere few seconds).REVIEW -Brilliant but notoriously difficult director Alfred Hitchcock was given to playing often sadistic practical jokes on his cast and crew. Some say the idea for the film was driven by the director's own obsession with Vera Miles. The actress he wanted to cast but couldn't due to her pregnancy. So incensed at Miles' temerity in getting pregnant for the third time, Hitch told her 'that two was sufficient, but that three was really obscene'. He tried to replicate her with the many elegant blondes he cast in subsequent films. Novak paid for not being Miles when Hitchcock forced her to do endless retakes, reducing her to tears. Vertigo, his most personal film, reveals much about the director's own need for control and his obsession with the feminine 'ideal', and about his determination to find in art possibility to transcend daily life.The visual poetry, the pull of the film's haunting landscape, and it's portrait of the human longing for transcendence for love or art sends us down a new intriguing pathway. Old Hitch is still playing with our heads, but this time he breaks through to our hearts.ONE OF THE DEFINITE GREATEST MOTION PICTURES EVER MADE.",Vertigo
127,onepotato2,Swirling Void,6,22 June 2007,"Back in the 80s when this film wasn't available, I read so much gushing praise for it that made me want to see it very badly. Finally the rights were resolved and five missing Hitchcock films were re-released.Despite my eagerness to see it, I was absolutely shocked to find it plodding, unintentionally amusing (the Saul Bass nightmare with Stewarts floating head) technically awful (those terrible, terrible rear-screen shots for the driving pursuit sequence.) and so gimmicky; that junky, clunky disclosure letter (as a narrative device) that gets torn up after Scotty finds Judy. And the powerfully unsubtle-ly Freudian Midge who just falls off the face of the earth around the halfway point.For the color restoration version I was more impressed. This must have been a factor of seeing it in a theater and coming to appreciate Stewarts anguished, pre-method performance.After watching all the parts of it I could bear last week I'm back to my earlier assessment of it. Technically it's just so crappy looking; the haze in the graveyard. Jimmy Stewart as the worst detective ever. ""Oh my God Kim Novak is two feet in front of me.... I'll just stand very still."" And the introductory malarkey with trances & Gavin Elster works exactly once; on further viewings it just sits there, in the way.Vertigo receives one alternate reading very well and that's about it for the enormous investment of your time. I find this movie artless. Give me Rear Window anytime.But you didn't need my ""me too!"" vote. That's what all the other easy raves are here for.",Vertigo
128,Seraphion,"Great plot, as always from Hitchcock's works",7,18 September 2014,"The story opens up strongly, introducing one key element to the whole plot. The plot itself unravels very nicely giving out the details bit by bit. I really like the main twist, although I kind of regret its positioning that kind of spoils quite about everything. The end twist tried to compensate for it but it's way much more predictable after the main twist spoils it all. Though personally I like Rear Window better than this movie, I think Vertigo can still make it to the great movies list because this movie serves a tale that is more focused on the psychological side of the mystery thriller. The acting side is nice in overall. It's always nice to see James Stewart's performance. Kim Novak can really give Stewart the balancing performance.",Vertigo
129,RatedVforVinny,Possibly the finest Alfred Hitchcock movie.,9,30 April 2020,"'Vertigo' is a strong contender for the best ever movie by Alfred Hitchcock and often features as either 1, 2 or 3 in the fan lists. An interesting fact in that he was one of the first known film makers that cinema goers started to follow (as a name) and was already facially known for presenting 'Hitchcock presents'. He was able to utilize such a visible persona, as well as to attract some of the very finest acting stars of the day. Once again James Stewart (four years on from 'Rear Window') is up and mobile (looking really tall), as he chases a mysterious woman around San Francisco. Featuring so many finely executed plot twists, a shocking ending and the icing on the cake, the rather wonderful music by Bernard Herman. His suspenseful, brooding score reminded me of 'Taxi Driver' (his last) almost 20 years on. 'Vertigo' seems to have also knocked off 'Citizen Kane' from the pedestal as the finest picture of all time, well voted by the critics.",Vertigo

131,richard-1787,An astounding movie in which James Stewart plays a monster,10,1 January 2017,"This is a truly astounding movie. It is so suspenseful I found it impossible to leave the room once it got going. There is no horror, no blood, no monsters threatening to jump out at you from dark corners. But between Hitchcock's masterful set up of each shot, the almost blood-chilling acting of James Stewart playing against type, the fear on Kim Novak's cold but very beautiful face, and Bernard Hermann's score, which heightens the tension in almost unbearable fashion, this movie moves slowly and carefully to its conclusion, never once letting you go.And then, for me, it dropped the ball from the top of the church tower and closed on a wrong note.---------- Spoiler ---------------------- Not that I wanted a ""happy end"" with Stewart forgetting all the pain he had been put through and marrying Novak. No, that would have been equally wrong. But Novak falling to her death because she is afraid of the person in the nun's outfit just did not work for me.I don't know what would have worked better, though.Still, it is an astounding movie.

133,raulfaust,Give me a break,4,11 July 2013,"From the get go I dislike this movie for such bad labeling. Most people consider this movie as a ""suspense classic"", whilst, in my point of view, it has no suspense at all. First, because there isn't an interesting mystery to be resolved; due to it's bad and slow plot, I just couldn't care less about who was Madeleine or why that girl was trying to commit suicide. I also didn't care about the retired cop or the crazy husband; they were both annoying. The plot is simply pointless, and so is the outcome. I don't blame Alfred Hitchcock for this movie being so bad, considering that plot itself is much worse than directing. Directing without a good plot can't deliver an entertaining and convincing movie, which is exactly the case. For those who look for real suspenseful movies with quality, consider watching 1960's ""Psycho"" instead.",Vertigo
134,Kingslaay,Great film making,8,31 May 2020,If there ever was an example on how to direct a film and use great techniques then Vertigo is a good example. The substance or plot is not riddled with complexity or has great layers but its the way that its told. Hitchcock is easily one of the greatest directors of all time and his brilliance shows in Vertigo. We see what he wants us to see. A man following a woman becomes an intense and harrowing journey because thats how we were meant to see it. Vertigo doesn't match the brilliance and great content of North by Northwest but its techniques and steering keep you captivated. An example of how a great director can take a simple plot to great heights.,Vertigo
135,PredragReviews,"""Only one is a wanderer; two together are always going somewhere.""",9,1 June 2016,"There are occasions when, in considering a film, one is tempted to ask: ""What made this movie so outstanding and lifted it from the status of a fine picture into a classic?"" Certainly ""Vertigo"" falls into that category, for it is one of Hitchock's finest films, possibly the best he ever made. Although the plot is rather improbable, and the director could perhaps have cut down on the automobile searches, this does not matter, as the film is excellent in all other respects. The film benefits greatly from the faultless performances of the players; in particular, Kim Novak. On seeing the film for the first time, one feels rather cheated by the solution being revealed at such an early stage. However, in retrospect, one realizes that the decision is the correct one, for it actually makes the story more credible. For example: when Scotty (James Stewart) meets Judy in the hotel, after her initial display of fear,she agrees after four minutes (I have timed this!) to go on a date with him and later agreeing to give up her job. Incredible? not when you understand her true identity and the fact that she has fallen in love with him - remember when, as Madelaine she said: ""It wasn't meant to happen this way"" before going into the bell-tower.The film itself is split into two very distinct parts. The first half of the film is a mystery/romance that is really just a setup for the second half of the movie where the real meat of the story lies. It is in the second half of the movie where the real drama is and it is handled superbly by Hitchcock, James Stewart and Kim Novak. You will notice that I'm not giving any details of the actually story itself, this is for good reason, you really need to see it yourself. There are several things which makes this film really special for me, mainly the emotional turmoil between both James Stewart's and Kim Novak I the last half of the movie. However, there is one aspect of the film which I have always though was quite ingenious. The twist in the story is not revealed at the end of the story, but actually about 2/3rds into the film. Now rather than spoiling the movie early, this just heightens the emotional anguish when you know the secret that Kim Novak is hiding and makes the tension and drama more powerful. The acting and characterization are excellent, the plot complex and intelligent and the film locations memorable ; the Golden Gate Bridge and Bell Tower scenes in particular. Rightly regarded as a cinematic classic.Overall rating: 9 out of 10.",Vertigo
136,Matt_Layden,Warrants Another Viewing From Me.,7,4 May 2016,"I'm going through some Hitchcock. I was really impressed with the simplicity of Dial M For Murder, now I've seen to go to the opposite side and taken a look at Hitchcock's most ambitious project, Vertigo.Using different lighting and colour schemes along with inventive camera techniques, Vertigo is highly regarded as one of, if not the, best Hitchcock film. Which is weird to me because if you were to ask anyone what they think his best film is, you'll get a variety of different answers. My takeaway is a little difficult. I'm still wrestling with this film because I was so utterly bored with the first half that I was seriously questioning why this film is so highly regarded. Then the halfway point hits and it instantly got me hooked. It demands you to look at the film in a different light and repeat a viewing. So how do I feel about that? I still don't know. What I do know is that this is NOT my favourite Hitchcock film.John Ferguson, a retired detective, is asked by an old friend to follow his wife. He suspects her of being 'possessed' by her great great grandmother, who committed suicide at the young age of 26. The man's wife is 26 and is afraid she might do the same. While following her, John becomes obsessed and will do anything to make sure she stays safe...from herself.I knew nothing about this film, so this supernatural element threw me for a loop. As I said before, the first half is slow and mundane to the point of insanity. I appreciated the creative techniques Hitchcock was implying in certain scenes, but I just couldn't force myself to care about anything. Then the surprise element is introduced and I thought the film was wrapping up soon...wrong. It goes on for an entirely different third act, which in reality, reflects Hitchcock's own persona. Roger Ebert expertly points out how Ferguson is actually Hitchcock with his controlling obsessiveness over his blonde actors. This is glaringly obvious and serves as another layer to this already rich film. Vertigo is something I need to revisit in the near future. Maybe the second time around I can see the brilliance and throw it higher on my list, as of right now Rear Window still stands near the top.",Vertigo
137,JuguAbraham,"""I heard voices""--an innocent statement for a great end",7,3 April 2006,"Hitchcock films end with interesting statements. Vertigo ends with a nun blandly stating ""I heard voices."" Then, the bell is tolled. Hitchcock loves to play with words and sounds to stir up the imagination of the viewer. Even when letters are written, Hitchcock, instead of showing the words as a conventional director would, he prefers to let the writer speak out the words that are being written.This is an unusual Hitchcock film where humor is hardly presentinstead the psychological atmosphere of the film is full of regret, gloom and doom, with death lurking everywhere, while the camera captures the opposite feelingsbright sunny exteriors, lush green dresses, green cars, red robes, spotless white coats. The film harks back to Hitchcock's ""Marnie"" in subject and treatment as it explores the inherent contradictions in life.Wagner's ""Tristan and Isolde"" is adapted by Bernard Herrmann, the music composer, for ""Vertigo"" in a very effective score that is not far removed from original piece.I look forward to viewing the film in 70 mm (its new form). This is a fascinating Hitchcock film in lush color with a great ending-but there are equally stunning Hitchcock films that did not rely on color. ""Notorious,"" ""Saboteur,"" and ""Blackmail"" are three Hitchcock films where ""black and white"" was equally stunning as the color in ""Vertigo""",Vertigo

Go up the stairs, Judy, and I'll follow.""How far, how deep into obsession can love for a woman drive a man? That's the very question that Alfred Hitchcock tackles in this twisty thriller.Having little knowledge of the plot of Vertigo is even more necessary than the average Hitchcock movie, so I'll reveal as little as possible. Jimmy Stewart plays an ex-detective who is convinced by an old friend to secretly follow his wife (Kim Novak), who has been acting strangely. What comes next is a completely unpredictable and dark tale of love, death, deceit, and obsession. The only thing that keeps Vertigo from being amongst my favorite Hitchcock movies is its uneven quality. The tone of the first half of the movie is quite different from the second half, and while that makes complete sense within the context of the story, I found the latter portion to be much more entertaining, as a result. The ending ranks right there with Notorious and The Birds as the most memorable that Alfred ever did.This was the first Hitchcock movie I ever saw, and in hindsight, it was a great one to begin with. Vertigo's mixture of mystery and darkness is a perfect introduction to the legendary director, and it fully deserves the sterling regard that it's earned over the years.",Vertigo
139,valadas,Too fanciful to be credible,5,20 September 2012,"I never was a Hitchcock fan and this review must be read in this light. I always thought that his films always created an intricacy of situations smelling of false that are suddenly disentangled in the end through an easy and doubtful solution. This movie is one more instance of this with a story full of gaps and snares, unreal and illogical in what concerns not only facts but also the psychological behaviour of the characters. In the end he concocts a rather dramatic final through the disclosure of the true story that was hidden behind the one that was being told us till then, in a rather superficial way This movie has not even at least the suspense or the thrill of some of his other movies like ""Psycho"" or ""North by Northwest"" for instance. It has several flaws and illogical or unexplained situations like for instance: a)- The plan to kill one's wife is too complicated involving a ghost story and the hiring of a double and a detective through a series of too artificial scenes; there is most surely a much easier and credible way to kill one's wife without being suspected of it. b)- It's unbelievable that when the detective meets for the first time after his friend's wife death the woman who lives in the hotel room that was supposedly used by the former, he couldn't recognize at once the woman he was in love with despite the different hair-do and make-up. c)- When the detective goes to that hotel for the first time trying to meet whom he then thought it was his friend's wife after having seen her through the window and it turns out that she isn't there after all, is the hotel lady manager also an accomplice in the plot when she says the other woman has not been there? And so on and so on. To declare this movie as the best movie ever made like a panel of distinguished critics recently did, is not only a huge falsehood but also an insult to tens of excellent films, hundreds of very good ones and even the thousands of those simply good.",Vertigo
140,Takethispunch,Awesome thriller.,10,10 July 2016,"Vertigo is a 1958 American psychological thriller film directed and produced by Alfred Hitchcock. The story was based on the 1954 novel D'entre les morts (From Among the Dead) by Boileau-Narcejac. The screenplay was written by Alec Coppel and Samuel A. Taylor.The film stars James Stewart as former police detective John ""Scottie"" Ferguson. Scottie is forced into early retirement because an incident in the line of duty has caused him to develop acrophobia (an extreme fear of heights) and vertigo (a false sense of rotational movement). Scottie is hired by an acquaintance, Gavin Elster, as a private investigator to follow Gavin's wife Madeleine (Kim Novak), who is behaving strangely.The film was shot on location in San Francisco, California, and at Paramount Studios in Hollywood. It is the first film to utilize the dolly zoom, an in-camera effect that distorts perspective to create disorientation, to convey Scottie's acrophobia. As a result of its use in this film, the effect is often referred to as ""the Vertigo effect"".Vertigo received mixed reviews upon initial release, but is now often cited as a classic Hitchcock film and one of the defining works of his career. Attracting significant scholarly criticism, it replaced Citizen Kane (1941) as the best film ever made in the 2012 British Film Institute's Sight & Sound critics' poll. In 1996, the film underwent a major restoration to create a new 70mm print and DTS soundtrack. It has appeared repeatedly in polls of the best films by the American Film Institute,including a 2007 ranking as the ninth-greatest American movie of all time.",Vertigo
141,DeeNine-2,THIS is a masterpiece?,8,17 August 2007,"Vertigo is considered one of the greatest films ever made and celebrated as Hitchcock's masterpiece. Perhaps it is. But I found myself bored as I watched it even though I had to admire the artistic intent. There are so many holes in the film it could qualify as cheesy. However, try telling that to those who love it. I think they love it as much for its flaws as for its perfections.Perfections: the feel of the San Francisco Bay area, the sense of historical California, the great beauty of the ocean framed by Monterey cypresses, the redwoods, the Golden Gate Bridge as seen from below and off to the side, the Bautista Mission, the fifties interior decor, Madeleine's costumes, the angle of Scottie's fedora, the acting by the three stars, James Stewart, Kim Novak, and Barbara Bel Geddes. The musical score by Bernard Herrmann is also celebrated, but I found it a bit overbearing at times, and of course Hitchcock loved using music to direct our sensitivities, and one can tire of that.Flaws: Scottie hanging from the drainpipe railing, watching the cop trying to save him fly over to land several stories down, dead. What is not explained is how the cop was expected to pull him up with nothing to hold onto or how Scottie managed to survive. Apparently he fell but only broke his back because in the next scene he is in surgical corset unable to scratch certain itches.The ersatz psychology. It was the fifties and psychoanalytic psychology was all the rage. One of the bestsellers of the day was The Fifty-Minute Hour: A Collection of True Psychoanalytic Tales by Robert Lindner in which a shrink relates tales told by his patients. Hitchcock loved this sort of thing (cf., Spellbound (1945) with Gregory Peck and Ingrid Bergman). Audiences also loved it. But the psychology is strictly bananas.Driving on the wrong side of the road (about which Hitchcock is reported to have said when it was pointed out to him, ""You drive your way. I'll drive mine."") The plot. Oh, the plot. Never but never has there been a more elaborate and unlikely murder-your-rich-wife scheme. Judy Barton is hired, persuaded or, gee, maybe hypnotized into playing Gavin Elster's wife who is to commit suicide by jumping off the bell tower at the mission. First Gavin (Tom Helmore) has to establish that she's crazy and suicidal. This is done by having her drive dreamily around the Frisco Bay area looking for the haunts of her great grandmother who committed suicide. The key is to get Scottie to believe it so he can testify that she was suicidal. For this to work, (1) Madeleine has to fool a police detective--one might say mesmerize him, which she does, (2) Get him to the bell tower at the right time where he is afraid to go to the top--that works, but you have to buy the psychology, (3) Time it so that Madeleine appears to jump off, but in reality you throw the dead body of your wife off after having broken her neck (body kept warm perhaps in your car with the heater on?), (4) Hide with Madeleine at the top of the tower until the coast is clear (whenever that might be).Although Kim Novak's performance is interesting it is unlikely that she could fool ex-detective Scottie into believing she was somebody else. When she reappears as Judy Barton in the brown hair and the different makeup, it really makes the audience do a double take before realizing that she and Madeleine are the same. But Scottie's take seems to be that she (and some other women at first glance) look like Madeleine--after all, he just got out of the nut house. It is only when he sees the necklace that he comes to his senses.Another thing aficionados love about this movie is the way Hitchcock was able to subtly strip his stars of their glamour and make them look more or less human. James Stewart never played a part anything like this before. All the funny faces he has to make, perplexed while driving, terrified on the way up the bell tower, insane and terrified in the dream sequence, etc. It is said that Hitchcock blamed the lack of popular success of this movie (when it was belatedly released, not now) on Stewart looking too old, and therefore Hitchcock never worked with him again. But I think Stewart, after seeing the way he looked in this movie--so unheroic, so lost as a real human being--decided he was never going to let Hitchcock do THAT to him again, and that's probably why they never worked together again.Kim Novak's curvy body and flopping you-know-whats are revealed in outfits that Grace Kelly would never wear. And poor Barbara Bel Geddes with those most unattractive glasses! How she pines for Scottie. One of the best scenes occurs when she shows Scottie her self portrait as the mysterious Carlotta with the glasses on (!) followed by her ""Stupid, stupid, stupid!"" self-flagellation after Scottie, who was offended at the grotesque sight, walks out.But why is Scottie always hanging out at her place? And how they talk the plot in the beginning so that we might know that they were once a couple! But Hitchcock never worried about anything but the effect his movie might have on the audience. Improbabilities, clumsy plot devices, etc., were secondary. And you know what, he was right, as P.T. Barnum was right. Hitchcock never overestimated the sophistication of his audience.Somebody said that the real entertainment in watching this movie is in watching it again after you know the story. I think they're right. It's definitely a film buff's movie.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!"" Get it at Amazon!)",Vertigo
142,sme_no_densetsu,One of Hitchcock's best,8,14 August 2011,"Alfred Hitchcock's ""Vertigo"" wasn't particularly well received at the time of its release but it has since become one of his most highly praised films. In a nutshell, the story concerns an acrophobic detective (James Stewart) who falls for the woman he's investigating (Kim Novak). The film explores the themes of identity & obsession, among other things.The stars both contribute compelling performances. Neither was recognized with an Oscar nomination but Novak particularly deserved one. Barbara Bel Geddes is good in support but she's much too young for the role (or maybe it's just that Stewart's too old for his role, considering that they're supposed to have met in college).The script was based on the novel ""D'Entre les Morts"" by French writing team Boileau-Narcejac. Their first novel had previously provided the basis for Henri-Georges Clouzot's Hitchcockian classic ""Diabolique"" so Hitchcock was keenly interested in their work. Like the earlier film, this one features a clever twist, though in this case the twist comes well before the end. The film is marked by its dream-like feel and singularly dark exploration of romantic obsession.Hitchcock's direction here is stately and filled with interesting touches throughout. The cinematography of Bob Burks is also routinely breathtaking. Then there's Bernard Hermann's moody score which is today considered one of the best in American films. The fact that none of these aspects of the film were recognized with an Oscar nomination is frankly unbelievable.In the end, although it isn't perfect I found ""Vertigo"" to be a highly compelling film, albeit one that seems atypical of Hitchcock in some respects. Then again, the movie's so unique that it would seem atypical of nearly any Hollywood director (except perhaps David Lynch).",Vertigo

On the other end, 15 folks said 4 stars, 21 say 3, 12 go with 2 stars, and 20 people gave it the minimum of 1 star.Jimmy Stewart is a retired police detective in San Francisco named John, often called Scotty, retired because his extreme vertigo caused a fellow officer to fall to his death-supposedly. An old college chum, Gavin Elster, contacts him and asks him for a favor-to follow his wife and find out where she is going. He isn't thinking she's cheating on him, only that she seems possessed by a woman who died over 100 years ago.Scotty follows her around the city by the bay, and we get many scenes depicting many days of him following her to a museum where she sits and stares at one particular painting, to a few other places including an old hotel, and to a mission said to be 100 miles from Frisco.At one point, he has followed her to the park just beneath the southern end of the Golden Gate Bridge, where Madeleine Elster leaps into the water. Scotty pulls her out, then takes her to his apartment, entirely unclothes the unconscious woman, dries out her clothes while letting her sleep in his bed, then finally talks to her when she wakes up.They wind up going about the city for a while, Scotty trying to get her to understand her psychological problems, and they seem to fall in love. But at the mission, she suddenly runs away from him, into the church and up the bell tower. Scotty follows but has to slow down because he gets dizzy whenever he looks down at the flights of stairs below him. (You'd think he'd just look up where she is running and not look down, but maybe that's just what I would do in his shoes.)He is not to the top when he hears a scream and sees Madeleine's body falling to the roof of the church below. The ruling, of course, is suicide and that would seem to be the end of it.But Scotty is now institutionalized because he now feels it's his fault two people have died. Simply as played out in the story, it didn't seem to be his fault at all, but...He gets released even though he's still obsessed with ""Madeleine"" the woman he thought he loved, even though she was believed to be the loving wife of his old friend. Yes, I had some problems feeling for this guy when he was romancing the friend's wife. The star of the show, the guy we're supposed to be rooting for, is not supposed to behave that immorally.Scotty goes around to all the places where he and Madeleine used to go. A few times he sees someone who slightly resembles her and gets confused, but comes back to his senses when he sees it is not Madeleine. Then a woman with her face is walking down the street. She doesn't have the platinum blond hair Madeleine did, it is a lovely light brown, but her face sure looks like her, even the phony painted eyebrows that are much longer than any real ones.Scotty follows her up to her room and knocks on the door. This woman shows no sign at all of having seen this man before, and she seems totally unwilling to admit him to ""talk"" as he asked to do, but he keeps insisting he just wants to talk. She admits him, then after just a question or two from him, and she starts telling him all about herself, as if she's really eager to let this stranger understand she's not the woman he knew. This seems really strange. I would think she would plainly say that she doesn't know him, give only her first name and tell him to hit the road.But she not only tells all, she decides to go out to supper with the guy. It is at this point that we see a clue that something is wrong. Inside the woman's closet it a gray woman's suit exactly like what Madeleine was wearing when she jumped off the tower. We are given no other information at this point.She seems to begin liking him even though he does some quite disturbing things. He almost orders her to call in sick for work the next day so they can go for a drive, and winds up buying her clothes-specifically that same woman's suit that exactly matches one Madeleine had. Then he coerces her to redo her hair in the exact style and color Madeleine had. Only then is Scotty willing to kiss her, only when he has remade her to ""be"" Madeleine.Along the way we get a ""flashback"" scene from Judy's view-we're not sure if it's a dream or what at first, but what it is is the telltale scene, a second look at the day Madeleine raced up the tower stairs. This time, we see her reach the top only to find Gavin and his actual wife, dressed just as Judy was, as he tosses her body over the side of the tower and grabs Judy as they slink off into hiding. That's all we get.Now I would think Judy, the woman's real name, would be extremely bothered by a suitor who insists she look exactly like some dead woman they guy once loved. Does he love me, or only when I look and act like ""her""?Only near the end of the film does Scotty figure out what really happened. He does so because of a dumb thing Judy did. Eliminate that one blunder and, from what we saw, it would appear they could happily get married and he might never know about the deception that happened earlier.I didn't mention Midge (Barbara Bel Geddes). She seemed to be the longtime girlfriend of Scotty's (and former short-term fiancee) who welcomed him entering her home without knocking, but who appeared to only be a friend. She was there in many scenes until about halfway through, then she disappeared from the film. Her exact purpose is a mystery to me.Weaknesses include a ""love"" growing between the fake Madeleine and Scotty when they didn't seem to spend much time really having a chance to develop such a thing. OK, so it wasn't really Gavin's wife, but Scotty didn't know that. He was a man of about 50, she a woman of about 25, in character as well as the actor and actress's real ages. This is even more reason to not be too interested in this as a love story. Why would Judy have taken to this man, I ask.The really weak point is when she, as Judy, seems to really fall in love with him-this old goat who changes everything about her looks, who seems to know nothing or care nothing about the real person she is, only the image of her as this other man's wife-who he didn't really know.As a murder plot, it didn't make much sense. Gavin wanted to kill his wife, so he let his friend Scotty spend, apparently weeks, following her, then getting to know her (Judy) while keeping the real wife away from him, somehow. Then he got it orchestrated for Judy to wear a particular outfit the day they go to the mission, and for her to tell him to let her go into the church alone, then Scotty panics and races up the stairs after her, thinking she will commit suicide, only to be too far behind and unable to stop her from leaping-so he thought. As far as it went, the verdict of suicide made sense, but...Even with vertigo from looking down from a height, Scotty could easily have climbed the stairs faster than a woman in high heels. If he was desperate to save her life, he could have avoided looking down at all and caught her near the top of the stairs, or just after she reached the top and spotted his buddy and the real wife. Then where would the murder plan be? That leaves a lot to chance, in an elaborate plot that took weeks, when you'd think he could have better orchestrated an easier way to kill her.As far as the movie went, we spent way too much time seeing Scotty driving around San Francisco following Madeleine's green car. Down various streets, turning, watching her park, going into the museum and watching her from across the gallery staring at the same portrait, watching her visit a grave in a cemetery.As someone else pointed out, he is told the woman in the grave that Madeleine seems to be possessed by, is supposed to be her great grandmother. That woman, Carlotta, died in 1851. If you figure she gave birth in 1850ish, and that woman did so in 1880, and that woman in 1910, that would still leave Madeleine to be not 25 years old, but 47. It should have been great-great grandmother.For the longest time in the early part of the film, there is no dialogue between the stars, just Scotty following her and watching her and we know nothing about the murder plot, and have been given almost no information about this ""possession"" of Madeleine by Carlotta.Scotty's behavior toward Judy and Judy when he thought she was Madeleine was troublesome, keeping me from liking this guy. Since the main details about the murder were given away about halfway through, there wasn't a mystery to solve either. The film had elements I liked, but it just doesn't stand out as a good movie to me, not even close to a classic. I love many Hitchcock films, including Jimmy Stewart's Rear Window, but I am only giving this one a 4.",Vertigo
144,Howlin Wolf,"Ooh, what a rush!!",8,30 May 2006,"No-one enjoyed toying with people's minds quite like Hitch; and ""Vertigo"" is a film that earns its right to sit proudly alongside his other psychological masterpieces. Stewart is superb and perfectly cast as the archetypal 'common man' who, after an accident, suddenly finds himself embroiled in a dizzying mystery he struggles to keep up with. If this all sounds a bit too ""Rear Window"", it plays sufficiently fresh to offer its own distinct pleasures, but it would probably be true to say that fans of one will certainly delight in the other, as well.From the captivating vortex of the title sequence onward, ""Vertigo"" plunges headlong into the story. This wouldn't be Hitchcock without even a hint of a Macguffin, but the real power of the story for me came from being drawn into someone's obsession, and of course the stunning climax of its ultimate resolution. A widely acknowledged classic that's lost none of its thrall in the modern age, ""Vertigo"" is totally absorbing, and grips you like few other tales have managed to do.",Vertigo

In the ""Sight and Sound"" directors poll the film is number 7 on the list.In ""Vertigo"" Hitchcock applies one of his favourite story telling techniques. Somewhat after halfway of the film he reveals to the audience the hidden truth, while his main protagonist remains totally ignorant. Curious enough this does not work as a spoiler. The tension of the film remains , but only takes on a different character. One asks himself no longer what the truth is, but if and how the main character will discover it.The theme of ""Vertigo"" is the restyling of a living woman after the example of a dead woman. This is also the theme of ""Rebecca"" (1940, Alfred Hitchcock), but the two films couldn't be more different. In ""Rebecca"" the ""force"" behind the restyling comes from the house where the dead lady used to live, and especially from its repesentative the main housekeeper Mrs Danvers. ""Rebecca"" is a haunted house genre film. In ""Vertigo"" the ""force"" behind the restyling comes from a man's sexual fantasies and desires. ""Rebecca"" is thus a psychological drama.",Vertigo
146,Cosmoeticadotcom,Overrated,6,23 September 2008,"Watching the films of Alfred Hitchcock reminds one of the fairy tale of Goldilocks And The Three Bears. Not so much in the actual filmic nature of the art, but in the critical reception accorded the films. As example, some of the films that are labeled masterpieces, like Psycho or The Birds, are just right in their assessment. Other films that are critically neglected are, in fact, among Hitchcock's better films, such as Rope and Frenzy. Then there are the films that are hailed as masterpieces, but which are profound disappointments. If they are not outright bad films, they certainly are only marginally solid films, and achieve their solidity mainly through technical accomplishments. In this category I would place Rear Window and Vertigo.It's not that Vertigo is an awful film, for technically it's very well made- especially considering that era, but the flaccid and absurd screenplay simply does not hold up a half century on. Add to that the fact that the film is glacially paced, and you have a fairly boring film; one that even Jimmy Stewart's crotchety presence can barely enliven. However, I have long lauded films that do not place plot ahead of character development, so one might ask why am I asking for a better plot and more briskly paced film? Well, simply put, all of the characters are cardboard cutouts, and plot details are easier to resolve than character depth. If one is going to give mere archetypes (and that's being generous, the characters are really more stereotypes than archetypes) then the plot better zing and have a good payoff. This one does not. Part of the problem with the screenplay is the utter dependence for the propulsion of the plot upon the Neolithic psychiatric pseudoscience of the era, which too many of Hitchcock's films are dependent upon, and which leave most of his films in very shallow waters intellectually. This lack of intellectual and emotional depth is part of the reason he is rightly looked down upon when compared to greater masters of film, such as Stanley Kubrick, Orson Welles, Federico Fellini, Werner Herzog, Ingmar Bergman, or Martin Scorsese.A film like this points out the fact that Hitchcock not only was not a 'deep' director, but could not have been, for by sacrificing what he did best- manipulation, suspense, and twists of plot, all he did was sacrifice what he did best. He had no Bergmanian depths to plumb. Is it really believable that Scotty would become a deaf-mute for a year over his supposed guilt in 'Madeline's' suicide? Stewart projects far too much sanity in this role, and as a filmic persona. When Midge is fussing over him he does not look remotely catatonic, merely sleepy. There were plenty of other downright bad moments in the film, of course, such as where Scottie is standing on a chair, looks out Midge's window, and faints gently into her arms. Now, he dwarfs her in size, and falling from several feet, he would not waft into her arms, but thud, and probably hurt both of them. This scene is set up only to show that Midge will always be there for Scottie, despite whatever convolutions their relationship has had. But, we get this from every moment they are together. There are many, many other screenplay moments that fail, and this surprises, for the co-screenwriters, Samuel Taylor and Alec Coppel, based the film upon the novel D'Entre Les Morts, by Pierre Boileau and Thomas Narcejac, who also wrote the story for Henri-Georges Clouzot's great thriller Diabolique, a tale that Hitchcock tried to get the rights to, but failed. Given Diabolique's greatness one can only assume that the screnwriters, in concert with Hitchcock, ruined what was probably a great story.If the script and direction is weak, however, the best parts of the film are the score, provided by Bernard Herrmann, and the camera work. The music directs the viewer, but does not lead nor overwhelm, save for the trite and sappy love scenes, which are bad all around. Even better than the film's soundtrack is the cinematography by Hitchcock's long time cinematographer Robert Burks. The palette is lush with reds, greens, and browns, as the shots of the sequoias, the Golden Gate Bridge, and the art museum are gorgeous, making the most of the now outdated Technicolor technology. There is also a brief scene which features Ellen Corby, who would later go on to fame as the crotchety grandmother in the television series The Waltons, that is humorous. For those interested in Hitchcock's cameo, it comes about eleven minutes into the film, in a throwaway shot designed only for the cameo, where we see him crossing a street before we get to the interior of Gavin Elster's office.Yet, even more so than the implausibilities, bad screenplay, and sexism, that damn the film is the fact that Vertigo is simply dull. Add that to a lead character who is a creep with problems, its love story pathetic, and its 'mystery' being rather pallid and given away too soon, and the claim that Vertigo is one of Hitchcock's most overrated films is a good one. At best, it is merely a mediocre film. And, as Goldilocks might claim, that sort of assessment is 'just right.'",Vertigo
147,seymourblack-1,"A Stylish, Subversive Masterpiece",10,1 March 2009,"""Vertigo"" is a beautifully realised psychological thriller which very elegantly tells the story of an extremely calculated murder plot which is expertly executed by a perpetrator whose involvement remains unrecognised (by the authorities) throughout. With its disturbing themes of obsession, deception, necrophilia, guilt and fear and its numerous noir motifs (mirrors, doubles, portraits etc), it provides a very stylish, absorbing and unsettling portrayal of a series of events in which, so many things are not what they appear to be and much is left unexplained. The skillful manner in which the more elliptical, dreamlike and thought provoking episodes are depicted are particularly enjoyable and its easy to see how these would be such a source of inspiration to the many directors who have been so strongly influenced by Alfred Hitchcock's work in later years.Despite the passage of time and all the technical and stylistic developments that have ensued since the making of this film, it's incredible how well the effectiveness of some of its components still stand up (e.g. the opening titles, Scottie's nightmare and the forward zoom / tracking out shots which emulate the sensation experienced by vertigo sufferers).Saul Bass' title sequence with its emphasis on the eye, the mind and spiralling designs, engages the attention immediately and with its level of pace and intensity, sets the mood for all that follows. The similarity that it bears to the opening sequence in Roman Polanski's ""Repulsion"" also leads one to suspect that Maurice Binder's work on that movie was, at least partially, influenced by ""Vertigo"".James Stewart as detective John ""Scottie"" Ferguson who retired from the San Francisco police department because of an experience which left him with an uncontrollable fear of heights, is hired by his old college friend, Gavin Elster (Tom Helmore) to keep an eye on his wife Madeleine (Kim Novak). Elster is particularly concerned about her fragile mental state and asks Scottie to monitor her actions and report back to him. After overcoming some initial reluctance, Scottie takes the job but soon finds himself captivated by the mysterious woman who he later saves from drowning after she unexpectedly jumps into San Francisco Bay. Following this experience, Madeleine tells Scottie about a dream she's had in which she falls to her death from a church tower. He recognises her description of the location and arranges to take her there so that, hopefully, by seeing the place, her nightmare will stop recurring.At the church, Madeleine begs Scottie to let her go in alone. He reluctantly agrees but becomes alarmed when he sees her running towards the tower. He chases after her, but becomes paralysed with fear before he can catch up with her and is then horrified when he sees her body falling past the tower window as she falls to her death. At the coroner's inquest, her death is recorded as suicide and Scottie is not held accountable for what happened either by the coroner or Gavin Elster. He is traumatised, however and subsequently suffers a nervous breakdown. The events that follow his eventual release from hospital then start to throw a different complexion on everything that had happened earlier.Madeleine's character certainly is a complex creation as she is actually a woman called Judy Barton, remodelled to look like Gavin Elster's wife, deceitfully indulging in behaviour which is designed to give the impression that she's living on the edge of insanity, being both obsessed by and possessed by the late Carlotta Valdes. Hitchcock points to Madeleine's duality very soon after she first appears on screen by showing her image in the mirrors in Ernie's Restaurant and the flower shop.The theme of doubling which centres on the Madeleine / Judy character continues throughout the story. Scottie is traumatised twice when, on both occasions, someone falls to their death from a great height, leaving him feeling guilt ridden. Scottie and Madeleine both harbour obsessive feelings about someone they believe is dead. Judy is given a make over by two different men (Scottie and Gavin). Scottie sees the object of his obsession fall from the church tower twice. Madeleine's hairstyle and bouquet mirror those depicted in the portrait of Carlotta and Scottie and Madeleine both have nightmares involving the church tower which appear to foreshadow their own deaths. Scottie is duped firstly into becoming obsessed with an apparition and secondly into becoming an accomplice to a murder.James Stewart gives an assured performance in a very familiar type of role as an ordinary guy who's caught up in an extraordinary sequence of events. Kim Novak as Madeleine is remote and aloof and successfully creates the sense of mystique which is such an important element of what makes her character so compelling. She also shows a certain amount of range in her acting by playing the parts of two women at different ends of the social scale. The outstanding performance from a supporting actor comes from Henry Jones as the dead-pan droning coroner who's marvellously cynical and eccentric.""Vertigo"" leaves the audience to ponder on whether Scottie's obsession was actually something pathological, a Jungian ""projection"" maybe or even just a commentary on the sometimes illusory nature of romantic attraction. Similarly, how was it that such a seemingly subversive story in which a murderer gets away unpunished, was allowed to pass the relatively strict censorship code which was in operation at the time of the movie's release?",Vertigo
148,RNMorton,Been thinking a lot about Kim ...,9,18 June 2005,"At least that's what Jimmy has been doing. Our boy is a former detective with an understandable case of trauma-induced vertigo whose weakness gets him played as the sap in a murder scheme. Along the way he gets sucked in by Novak, looking even better than she normally does (which is always fantastic). Fascinating study of obsession with a woman, in this case with a woman Stewart mistakenly believes is dead. Or does he? I didn't originally like this film as much as some of the more mainstream Hitchcock, Jimmy sure seemed to be wound uncomfortably tight. But I've come to slowly appreciate it through piecemeal viewings over the years, and NOBODY plays the unfathomable beauty better than Kim.

149,bobsgrock,The Master's Masterpiece.,10,29 May 2009,"It can be argued in many different ways what actually is the best film Alfred Hitchcock ever made. For my money, it is Vertigo, the masterful story of a man who finds a woman, loses her, and attempts to bring her back with harrowing results.What makes this film so engaging, even after multiple viewings, is the way in which Hitchcock is able to bring us to sympathy with the protagonist, Scottie Ferguson, an ex-detective with some serious psychological issues. As Scottie begins to follow the wife of one of his college friends, he becomes fascinated by the icy, alluring blonde. We feel the same way. When something terrible happens to her, we feel the anguish and guilt Scottie does. Of course, none of this could be possible without the incredible performance of James Stewart, perhaps his best after the role of George Bailey. And Hitchcock makes the most of this evocative first half, told mostly in long shots and soft lighting.The second half is more of an attempt for Scottie to rebound and when he finds a girl similar to the mysterious blonde, he finds himself trying to recreate that which is gone. Of all of Hitchcock's films, this may be the strangest with themes of necrophilia, voyeurism, and sexual obsession. Matching Stewart's incredible performance every step of the way is Kim Novak, in my mind the best of Hitchcock's blonde actresses, so beautiful yet almost forbidding in a way. Maintaining every scene with careful scrutiny and eye for detail, this may be Hitchcock's best showing as a director, and it all leads up to one of the best filmed endings in cinema history and leaves you needing to watch again, hoping to catch a glimpse of the true emotions of Scottie and Judy, or is it Madeline?",Vertigo

153,TheUnknown837-1,hauntingly dramatic and absorbing - Alfred Hitchcock's masterpiece about obsession and one of the most heart-breaking motion pictures of all time,10,24 March 2009,"If there ever was a film that was truly ahead of its own time, then Alfred Hitchcock's Vertigo is that film. This is Hitchcock's most personal, passionate film, reportedly one of his favorites ""with some reservations"", unfortunately it did not perform very well during its 1958 release neither box office or reception wise. Hitchcock put the blame for the movie's box office failure on its star, James Stewart, whom he felt was becoming too old to keep audiences interested anymore. What Hitchcock did not realize was that this was not true. The only problem there is with Vertigo is that it was made too early in time. After a re-evaluation about ten or twenty years later, it became realized as one of the greatest motion pictures of all time, is continually analyzed and studied to this day, and is regarded as his greatest achievement in film-making.Vertigo, based on a French crime novel by Pierre Boileau and Thomas Narcejac, tells the obsessive story about a former San Francisco detective (James Stewart) suffering from acrophobia, who is asked by a friend (Tom Helmore) to follow his wife (Kim Novak) in fear that she might be possessed by the spirit of one of her ancestors and may be driven into her death. The detective becomes dangerously obsessed with the woman and ultimately falls in love with her, completely unaware of the horrific consequences that will follow.Alfred Hitchcock is affectionately known as the ""master of suspense"" for his remarkable ability to create horrifying moments such as the shower scene in Psycho (1960), another heavily analyzed film. But Hitchcock was always capable of making something far better and no where else in the director's works is that more clear than in Vertigo. This is not a horror story. This is a powerful dramatic mystery film that also embraces the rarely explored theme of obsession. Yes, it is a romantic film, but unlike any others before or after it.Of course, Vertigo is a love story. The plot is driven by James Stewart's character and his obsession with the woman he is hired to follow and suspect. But this is not at all how love stories were made before or even today. If Vertigo was made today, things would be completely different. The filmmakers would succumb to the hackneyed conventions that audience members tend to require for association with the movies they watch. The love between the two lead characters played by Stewart and Novak is not expressed through heavy, over-the-top kisses or unnecessary sex scenes like what we see today. It is shown through their actions, their behavior, their performances. Remember, this is a film that is about obsession. Not lust, obsession. And the obsession theme comes about especially within the last twenty minutes of the film. I will not explain how, I want you to look at it for yourself and see what I mean. When the movie was first released, this tactic was looked upon lowly by critics at first, again, because it was something revolutionary, ahead of its own time. It's not the conventional love story, so that also means, do not expect a few kisses and a happy ending. Again, this is revolutionary and because it's something we don't see everyday, it's so much more effective and wonderful.The leading force in this film is Alfred Hitchcock. Like I said, this is a personal film of his'. The next most effective tools are the performances of James Stewart and Kim Novak, who portray two of the most passionate lovers I've ever seen on film. And the third is definitely Bernard Herrmann, the music composer. Oscar-winning director Martin Scorsese noted that Herrmann's score revolved around the main theme: obsession. And in deed, he was right. The score to Vertigo is hands-down beautiful. The scene where Scottie and Madeleine first kiss before the crashing waves of the Pacific Ocean (my favorite scene) has one of the most effective soundtrack pieces ever. Basically, Herrmann's score is more than just something in the background. It's an effective, driving presence that really makes this movie so special along with its other fantastic elements. Herrmann is one of the most mimicked composers of all time and this is most obvious in Vertigo, which I feel would be about three-quarters as good without his music.It's a shame the critics of 1958 were unwilling to accept such a revolutionary film at the time. It ended the collaboration between Hitchcock and James Stewart, who had worked many times before on movies such as Rear Window (1954), and Hitchcock ultimately ended up stuck with the horror genre instead of being able to work on more passionate movies such at Vertigo. Thankfully, like wine allegedly, it gets better with age. Keep in mind, this is a movie that also likes to play with your head. You may have to see it two or three times before you get the whole picture, but when you do, you will embrace it with more power than ever. I myself have seen Vertigo a great deal of times and each time, it just gets more and more powerful. In essence, I am obsessed with Vertigo. It may have been ahead of its time, but it is certainly one of the most spectacular and wonderful motion pictures ever crafted by human hands.",Vertigo

Along the way, he falls in love and has some curious experiences revolving around mistaken identity and his fear of heights. Dare I say that James Stewart hasn't been better (at least in a Hitchcock film) than here. Kim Novak also acquits herself rather nicely in the typical Hitchcock blonde role, although I still think Grace Kelly is a slightly better actress. All of Hitchcock's tricks are put to full use here, and things start off brilliantly with my favorite title sequence so far. Saul Bass and Bernard Herrmann were two of Hitch's greatest collaborators, and they certainly did some of their best work here. From a story perspective, the narrative takes a number of twists and turns which a discerning viewer will probably figure out beforehand, but its the execution of said twists that really make them work. They aren't telegraphed, but rather are hinted at or suggested. And if there's anything that makes a Hitchcock film extremely watchable, is how he is able to manipulate audience expectations through the power of suggestion. From a technical perspective, there was quite a bit of impressive camera-work and photographic effects that add to a sense of disorientation and suspense. In particular, there are a few zoom in/track out shots that visually illustrate James Stewart's character's acrophobia. There was also a really trippy dream sequence that served as a nice reprise of the opening title sequence. Even the production design, sets, costumes, etc. added to the visual splendor. Even when the narrative slows down (to ease the tension), there's always something beautiful to look at, be it a person or one of the many on-location shots of downtown San Francisco. And finally, Bernard Herrmann's score was pretty much perfect, helping to build tension at the right moments and backing off when necessary. A couple key moments in the film happen sans score, and the mark of a good composer is knowing which moments to back off and let the drama speak for itself. Put together, all of the various production elements form a package which, to me, is the epitome of what Hitchcock brought to cinema. You have interesting (and attractive) characters, a suspense-filled story, brilliant camera-work and a rapturous score. Even the ending this time felt better than in his other films. Although it would probably benefit someone new to Hitchcock to start with something earlier in his filmography (to get a sense of progression), VERTIGO is probably the pinnacle of his style and certainly essential when it comes to film classics.",Vertigo
157,gizmomogwai,Hitchcock's magnum opus,10,12 April 2011,"Alfred Hitchcock's 1958 psychological thriller Vertigo has enjoyed a gain in stature over the past 15 years, not bad for a film that was thought to be totally unremarkable when it first came out. In 1998 the American Film Institute broadcast its list AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies, ranking Vertigo in the 60s. In 2007 they rewrote their list, moving Vertigo to the top 10- specifically #9- making it Hitchcock's highest ranking film on the list. At the Academy Awards it was nominated for art direction and sound but was otherwise ignored. It wasn't even in the running for Best Picture or Best Director. (Hitchcock never won an Oscar for Best Director; his only film to win Best Picture was 1940's Rebecca).The film's direction and music score are masterful, so the look and atmosphere of the film become hypnotic. That much, Vertigo's critics would find hard to dispute. But the story is also deep- in fact, so deep that Hitchcock felt the need to follow up on it with the more fun film North by Northwest (also a classic). Vertigo is about the dangers of obsession as it can affect anyone- the destruction it causes and the way it twists love. Like Rebecca, in a way it's a ghost story without ghosts or even a tale of necrophilia, like Hitchcock himself said, in that Jimmy Stewart's character believes the woman he loves is dead, but he still can't let go of her. He can't forget her. He goes out looking for someone like her. And he forces the image of his beloved on his new love interest, also played by Kim Novak.But the movie is also a tale of deception and betrayal. For Stewart's character, the world is turned upside down when he realizes the girl he loved and his new love interest are the same person. The way this ends is incredible. He lost his woman on the tower twice. That was the only way to end it- a happy ending with Stewart and Novak reconciling wouldn't have fit the overall sinister tone of the story.The movie hooked me from the beginning, because of the atmosphere Hitch created. When Jimmy Stewart is first following Kim Novak around, seemingly nothing is happening but the tension is high, the mystery is compelling. I've never understood the criticism that there's too much of Stewart following Novak in his car; Hitchcock acted in moderation. He acted in moderation again when we didn't see any nudity in an erotic scene where Novak is naked in bed.I've heard other criticism, including that the story is counterintuitive. In real life, Stewart would have recognized his new girlfriend and his dead lover were the same person, even if the hair colour was different. The movie may also lack closure. Foreign audiences got an added ending in which we see Stewart back together with his old friend Midge and news has come that the murderer is about to be arrested and extradited. The so-called ""Foreign Censorship Ending,"" which is included in the bonus features of the DVD, was needed for countries that had laws against depicting murderers getting away with the crime. Hitchcock thought the added ending was unneeded, and indeed, it adds nothing to the story because the murderer wasn't emotionally a large part of the film.As for the claim that the storyline is unrealistic, some people try to get around that charge in unusual ways like asserting the vast majority of the film is actually Stewart's dream. In an early scene in the movie, Stewart is seen dangling from a rooftop, making him realize for the first time that he has a fear of heights. The movie never reveals how he survived, perhaps because he didn't survive it at all. He fell to his death, and as he was falling the events of the film are what flashed through his mind. However, the ""it was all a dream"" thing is cliché. And too much happened in the movie for Stewart to imagine while he plunged to his death. The film may not be totally realistic- but it touches you in a real way.",Vertigo

159,hall895,Act 1: Ho-hum. Act 2: Wow! Act 3: Ho-hum.,7,17 April 2006,"One gets the idea that Vertigo was probably one of M. Night Shyamalan's favorite films growing up. A rather ordinary film meandering along until, Bam!, the big twist that pulls you up out of your seat, puts a new spin on everything which has come before and leaves you dumbstruck by how brilliant the whole thing was. But whereas Shyamalan had the good, for lack of a better word, sense to end The Sixth Sense right after the big twist, in Vertigo the big twist is stuck in the middle somewhere and by the time the film finally wraps up the impact of that big moment has been lost. The shock, the sense of wonder and amazement, all wears off as you watch a prolonged end to the film which is rather dull and drawn-out...kind of like the whole first half of the movie.Vertigo tells the story of San Francisco police detective John ""Scottie"" Ferguson, played by James Stewart. Forced to retire when afflicted with, what in his line of work, is a crippling case of vertigo, Scottie takes on one last case as a favor to an old acquaintance. He is hired to follow this man's wife, Madeleine. Played by Kim Novak, Madeleine may be a little bit crazy, appearing to be, or at least believing to be, possessed by the spirit of a long-dead woman. Scottie follows Madeleine around and after watching a number of much too long sequences which consist entirely of something along the lines of ""Madeleine driving her car turns left, now Scottie following behind her turns left, now Madeleine turns right, now Scottie turns right..."" you may well find yourself saying ""Get on with it already!"" Eventually the story (rather than just the cars the characters are driving) takes a few twists and turns but never really seems to get moving. And then comes the big twist, what is seemingly the ultimate payoff for all the rather humdrum stuff that has come before. But then it's straight back to the humdrum stuff and quite a bit more of it too. Nobody would ever seriously question the genius of Alfred Hitchock, but in this instance, it seems he just didn't have the good sense to simply let this film end. It starts out simply OK, for a fleeting moment promises to be something spectacular, but then ends up back at simply OK. Not a bad movie by any means, but you get the sense it could have been so much more.Playing against type, more anti-hero than hero, Stewart does a pretty good job with what he has to work with. Unfortunately, for much of the film there really isn't much of anything for him to do. There's only so much an actor can do with entire scenes which require him to do nothing but stare through a car windshield. As Madeleine, Novak is somewhat cold, icy and detached but she has to be for the character she plays. How good her performance really is cannot be appreciated until the full story is revealed. It must have been a very difficult role to play and she pulled it off wonderfully. The other seemingly significant character is Scottie's old friend Midge, played by Barbara Bel Geddes. But in the end it turns out maybe she wasn't so significant after all as she simply disappears as the final act plays out, another frustrating note in what can be a really frustrating film. There's a good story here and some moments of true suspense. There's fine acting, most especially by Novak in her truly challenging role. And there's that big twist which for a moment promises to pull the whole thing together into a wonderful package. But the moment passes and what we're left with is a good movie which you get the feeling could have been truly great but fell just short of the mark.",Vertigo
160,vip_ebriega,Hitchcock's masterpiece.,10,11 October 2009,"My Take: Still one of the most effective and engaging thrillers ever made. An obsessive work of art as only Hitchcock could make 'em. Misunderstood and unappreciated upon its release, VERTIGO is now one of the most celebrated and much talked-about film from the master Alfred Hitchcock. Not even Hitchcock himself could create such an entrancing film as VERTIGO ever again. It's an unqualified success from the man well-regarded as ""The Master of Suspense"". VERTIGO isn't just a great puzzling thriller, it's art. Like a painting by a sophisticated artist, you stare ponderously at VERTIGO and you'll always find something new and intriguing to talk about it. Although criticized for being miscast in the role, James Stewart gives one of his best and darkest performances as John ""Scottie"" Ferguson, a former cop who had to quit the force due to his Acrophobia. In a chance of redemption, Scottie is contacted by an old college friend (Tom Helmore) to investigate on the strange behavior of his wife Madeline (Kim Novak). After this set-up, the movie takes a plunge into the deepest and darkest realm of Hitchcock pleasures. A knotty thriller and a romance with a twist, this is Hitchcock at his very best and most satisfying, but you may want to go back and see it again and again just to get the hang of things, but consider that one of the film's many pleasures. In a time where love is considered a powerful feeling, one that conquers all obstacles, Hitch also unveils the darker side of such heavenly feeling; love as a dangerous poison. One might say it's a case of Hitchcock baking his own cake and eating it, but it's more of letting out that skeleton in his closet; unveiling his innermost and deepest obsessions and raising it way up high for everyone to see. As a result, VERTIGO didn't do so well in it's day. But that just proves it: This movies way ahead of its own time. Had Hitch gone the wrong way, he might have lightened its tone and gave it a cheesy Hollywood ending. Had it been done that way, VERTIGO couldn't possibly be talked about as much today. After 30 years of absence, VERTIGO was re-released sometime in the 80's (along with other classics as THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH, THE TROUBLE WITH HARRY, ROPE and REAR WINDOW, now dubbed the ""Five Lost Hitchcocks"") with restored footage and sound. On DVD, Hitchcock's classic is better than ever, with first-rate picture quality and sound. You'll swear the movie has not been made THAT long ago. The picture is clear, making the film look like its brand new, and the new soundtrack is breathtaking (Bernard Herrmann's score never sounded so great!). This is a perfect treatment to a one-of-a-kind masterpiece that's bound to entertain and be studied for generations to come. Rating: ***** out of 5.",Vertigo
161,one9eighty,Don't look down!,9,5 March 2021,"San Francisco detective John ""Scottie"" Ferguson (James Stewart) suffers an experience which leaves him scarred with a case of acrophobia (fear of heights), and vertigo (a false feeling of spinning to the senses). He retires early from his job but is soon roped back into action when an old friend from college, Gavin Elster, asks him to follow his wife Madeleine. She is acting strange and he rescues her on more than one occasion. Things turn bad though when she ascends a church spire, and he is unable to follow her due to his condition. Frozen by fear he sees her plunge to her death from the rooftop. Later, after the dust has settled and Gavin is receiving treatment in a sanatorium, Scottie can't shake the case. One day he runs into somebody who looks exactly like Madeleine but claims to be Judy Barton. This drives Scottie to taking things further, much further in fact, to the point where he won't settle for what he believes has happened. Could Judy be Madeleine? Is it all a ruse? If so, why?",Vertigo
162,gftbiloxi,The Hitchcock Masterpiece,10,21 May 2005,"As much ""art"" film as Hollywood product, VERTIGO was generally savaged by critics upon its release; today it is widely regarded as Hitchcock's single finest film. The story is extremely well known: a retired police detective with an incapacitating fear of heights, Scottie, is engaged to shadow a beautiful woman, Madeline, whose husband suspects her of being suicidal. Scottie soon becomes obsessive about Madeline--but circumstances quickly spin out of control, and his love turns to tragedy and madness.Unlike most Hitchcock films, VERTIGO unfolds slowly, drawing the viewer into the relationship between Scottie and Madeline at the same pace as the characters experience it. At the same time, Hitchcock presents the viewer with a number of visual motifs (such as the famous spirals found in the film) to reinforce the increasingly disturbed nature of the story. As the film progresses, VERTIGO develops a powerfully hypnotic quality rather like the dreamed nightmare of a slow-motion fall.To a certain extent, the stars of VERTIGO are cast against type. This is particularly true of James Stewart, who is best known as the All-American Everyman, and his performance as the increasingly neurotic Scottie is all the more disturbing for our knowledge of his more typical performances. Although usually noted more for beauty than for acting ability, Kim Novack gives a remarkable and extremely believable turn in what is easily the finest performance of her career. The supporting cast--which includes particularly fine performances by Barbara Bel Geddes and Konstantin Shayne--is also excellent, and Bernard Hermann's excellent score adds tremendous dimension to the film.Some viewers, particularly those enamoured of such rapid-fire Hitchcock romps as TO CATCH A THIEF and NORTH BY NORTHWEST, may find themselves impatient with the film's leisurely pace; some viewers will themselves unable to see beyond the twists in the script to grasp Hitchcock's statement on obsessive love. But for most viewers--myself included--this is ""the"" Hitchcock film, the great masterpiece by a director renowned for masterpieces. A personal favorite, and very highly recommended.Gary F.

When people think of movies in general, you guessed it, they think of Vertigo. Imagine following a mystery woman through San Francisco, who may or may not think that she's from another century. At the same time, you struggle with crippling acrophobia so badly that it threatens to bring the whole case down. This is Scottie's dilemma and boy is it a ride right into hell. Hitchcock was, and always will be, the master of suspense and psychological horror. Without ever being gratuitous or obvious, he knows visually how to tap into our worst fears.

165,Stampsfightclub,Hitchcock delivers another wonder with consistently thought out thriller,9,31 May 2009,"Retiring cop John Ferguson (Stewart) is hired to stalk Madeline Elster (Novak) and finds he is slowly falling in love with the suicidal woman.Vertigo has now become one of the most critically acclaimed crime thrillers by the legendary Brit Alfred Hitchcock.The opening title sequence is excellent; particularly considering it was made in the late 1950s when technologically was restricted. The tantalizing colour montage and shifting images makes the James Bond efforts look like child's play. The accompanying song helps generate a feeling of excitement and we are right at the start of an energetic movie.The opening sequences with Stewart's Ferguson and his job partner chasing an anonymous villain across the rooftops is vintage action and excitement, perfect Hitchcock styling also. Then as Ferguson losses his balance and is caught dangling we have the setup for a beautifully lit film.We learn Ferguson has now retired from developing vertigo with this experience and what follows is a sweet slow build up in the mystery of the beautiful and strange Madeline, an estranged woman played with a sharp vagueness by Kim Novak. Her soft dialogue and timing help set her up for an emotional interplaying manipulative character in the latter stages and is a fine character development by Hitchcock.James Stewart, in his last pairing with the director, is impressive once more with a professional but eager character. This particular role of the star is often remarked as a dent in an otherwise brilliant film.It is perhaps easy to see why as he has no mysterious vigour that his character from Rear Window had and the story perhaps required more from him here in 1958, but I thought he carried the emotional scenes well.Vertigo is labelled as a tantalizing thriller and when comparing it to modern day films with the same tag you wonder if something has gone wrong. There have certainly been rapid developments over the last 50 years and the renowned ones in the 21st century, the Bonds and Bourne's, have that vibrant fast energy with extra charisma. Vertigo is the build up to what was to come, a major influence. The car scenes for example are slowly paced but edge up a gear as the stakes in the plot steadily rise.Vertigo therefore is thankfully not dated but given the vast amounts of modern thrillers, it may seem so to others. It may lack suspense when the romance lingers but the sheer spectacle of the story puts this doubt away.Hitchcock once again has a consistent directional release with wonderful character placement and a fine selection of twists and turns to give the would-be dull parts that excitement. One excellent part is towards the end in the Bell Tower when we see Ferguson's shake up of Vertigo. It is fair no one does a bird's eye view shot like the brilliant Hitchcock, who once again, has made a classic.",Vertigo

167,jluis1984,Masterpiece or failure? I agree with the former,9,13 February 2006,"When Alfred Hitchcock's ""Vertigo"" opened in 1958, it had a cold reception by both critics and audience, and many even consider it a failure in his remarkable career. Even Hitchcock wondered about what went wrong and he blamed lead star James Stewart for the failure. What probably happened, was that this time, Hitchcock's usual walk on the dark side went a bit too far for the times.""Vertigo"", based on Pierre Boileau's novel ""d'Entre Les Morts"", is a dark tale of romance, obsessions and lies, all spiced up with the lead character's acrophobia. James Stewart is our protagonist, as Scottie, he plays a detective whose sudden retire from the police was caused by an accident involving his acrophobia, his fear of heights.Hired by Gavin Elster (Tom Helmore), a mysterious old friend from school; he accepts the mission of following Elster's wife, Madeline (Kin Novak), who supposedly is possessed by the ancient spirit of one of her ancestors, and that eventually will take her life. As Scottie tries to protect Madeline, he falls in love with her, starting a forbidden romance that is doomed from the start. After Scottie fails to save Madeline's life due to the vertigo caused by his acrophobia, his obsession with her take him to commit unexpected actions.Boileau's complex story of obsession may had been too much for the critics and the audience of its time; and watching James Stewart going from a regular guy to a man bordering insanity certainly didn't help the film. Nevertheless, time has proved that ""Vertigo"" was indeed a powerful film undeserving of the cold reception it had.James Stewart gives probably his best performance ever, the sudden fall from grace that eventually take its toll on Scottie is perfectly portrayed by Stewart. Hitchcock was really wrong at blaming James for the failing, as it was the audience who was not ready to see their hero turned into a grotesque monster.Kim Novak plays his role with grace, although certainly her character is not as demanding as Stewart's. The movie is all about Scottie and his failed romance leading to the destruction of his life. This complex persona makes him one of the best fictional characters ever written, let alone portrayed on film.The technical aspects of the movie are superb too, Hitchcock creates a brilliant composition of colors and the visuals are beautiful. Bernard Herrman's score is subtle but fitting, although not as powerful as his famous work on ""Psycho"".If a flaw is to be found, I would say that the script developed for the film was probably not the most friendly for the audience. This film is certainly not for everyone, as it's slow pace and heavy darkness in the subject may turn off people familiar with Hitchcock's lighter films as his usual dark humor is not present here The only film I can relate to ""Vertigo"" in terms of harsh ""darkness"" would be ""The Wrong Man""; although the big difference is, that in that film, the trouble is caused by outside forces, while in ""Vertigo"", we get a glimpse to that dark part of our soul we do not dare to watch.The first time I watched it, I was not sure about what had just happened in front of my eyes, not sure if it was good or bad. After a second watch I guess this is of the kind of films that grow on you. Some consider it a failure and others consider it a masterpiece; my opinion stands closer to the latter: I call it a great piece of cinema. 9/10.",Vertigo
168,The_Movie_Cat,Is it just me?,4,31 December 2000,"WARNING: REVIEW CONTAINS MAJOR SPOILERS, ONLY READ IF YOU'VE SEEN THE FILM.
So THIS is the much-lauded classic, a critical hit and a permanent resident of the IMDb top thirty? Was I watching a different film or something?James Stewart is so lightweight as an actor I kept expecting him to float away, which is maybe why he doesn't fall in the beginning... and as for his voice! Don't get me wrong, I've nothing against people with lisps and what have you (Bogart never let it get in his way) but for an adult thriller? I kept expecting him to say ""Be vewy vewy qwiet, I'm hunting wabbits, harharharharharharhar!""The only sense of Vertigo I got was a dizzy feeling when I looked at the video timer... still an hour and forty minutes to sit through? But it feels like an age! Don't get me wrong, Alfred Hitchcock is a fantastic director in terms of shots, angles and lighting, but his slightly campy, unsatisfyingly middlebrow suspensers - Psycho excepted - are never fulfilling. Yes, Vertigo is one of the best-directed films of all time, but the performances and plot are no match for the presentation. Hitchcock could shoot dog mess. Even if it was taken from an angle with reverse zoom and colorised lighting it would still be dog mess.Like a meandering travelogue, Elmer, er, Stewart drives around in very nicely mounted but boring all the same street shots. I mean, Hitchcock was having a joke when he made this, surely? Plot elements are brought in, then neglected, while others are allowed to stand still or be completely overlooked. I've read reviews that say the film is complex, which it possibly is in terms of reference. But the plot - Woman pretends to be someone else's wife. Isn't really. Pretends to be killed. Gets found out by likeably light bloke from It's A Sentimental Life - could have been written on the back of a matchbox. As for the ""twist"" - that Novak staged her own death with a dummy - the dummy used was so unconvincing it would have been more of a surprise if it had turned out to be real.Also odd are a surrealistic dream sequence that gets so near to a cartoon it reminded me of the ""Pink Elephants"" sequence in Dumbo, and an ending that redefines the meaning of ""abrupt"". I can picture Hitchcock in Heaven right now, laughing his head off that such a silly film, one that he probably dashed off for a bet, is receiving such a critical reappraisal. Vertigo is in equal terms dull and unconvincing as drama... or is it just me?",Vertigo
169,gab-14712,Now I Know Vertigo Feels Like!,9,10 January 2016,"Vertigo is one of the more complicated movies I have ever seen, and just trying to think about what exactly is happening was enough to make my head spin in opposite directions, and I mostly mean that as a compliment. It just shows what a competent movie director Alfred Hitchcock made. There are many things happening in the movie, so you will have to pay attention to keep up with what is going on. It took me two grasps to understand the basics of the plot. Kudos to Hitchcock in creating a movie that effectively employs plot twists and turns to keep the movie audience guessing.So in a way. this thriller could be about Hitchcock himself and the way he handles women in his movies. Hitchcock is famous for his control over the production, especially when it comes to his movies. They all have the same qualities in his films, and thus end up looking foolish. Vertigo is one of his best films, because he spoofs himself in away. The men in the movie, especially the main character Scottie Ferguson, treats the women rather in a disrespectful, obsessive way. It shows how men can become obsessive over things they can't have, especially the women.As it is with many Hitchcock films, they are all technically impressive. A big part of the film is the term ""vertigo"" itself. By definition, vertigo is essentially being afraid of heights. Scottie's backstory is explained in the beginning, and part of it shows why he was afraid of heights after going through a rooftop chase and almost falling off a roof. The way his vertigo explained was actually quite frightening. Seeing the shots from ground to sky as the camera moves away from the ground made his fear even more realistic.So what is this film all about? Well, Scottie Ferguson (James Stewart) is a former detective who is retired because of his paranoia with heights. One day, a former colleague named Gavin (Tom Helmore) approaches Scottie with a request to follow his wife around, Madeleine (Kim Novak) because he fears she was possessed by a dead person. Scottie reluctantly agrees to do so. During his investigation, Scottie begins to fall in love with her. But due to a tragic accident, Madeleine dies. Soon thereafter, Scottie meets another woman named Judy (also played by Kim Novak), who uncannily looks similar to the deceased Madeleine. Scottie begins to grow obsessed with her and he eventually tries to groom her into a mirror image of Madeleine. Doing so helps begin what is a shocking climax perhaps resulting in a murder conspiracy.This film is very much well-acted. James Stewart is one of Hollywood's ""Golden Age"" stars and he delivers a magnificent performance. He made his fear of heights very believable and his growing obsession in the latter part of the film was incredible to watch, even though he was a treating a woman a way a man should never treat a woman-through compulsive obsession. He treated Judy like an object, and in a sense mirrors Hitchcock's reality. Kim Novak delivered a convincing performance in her roles as Madeleine and Judy. She's blond, icy, and often humiliated-very normal in a Hitchcock thriller. But without spoiling anything, Judy and Madeleine are two characters who are closely related and Novak was able to play both of the roles effectively.Overall, Vertigo is a very strong Hitchcock thriller. It's undeniably scary and creepy, with Hitchcock excels at making his films be. The beginning is very effectively scary, as we are introduced to Scottie's vertigo. His obsession towards the women was also creepy, but at the same time, puts you to the edge of your seat making you wonder what will happen next. I won't spoil anything, but the ending is a shocker and its something you won't see coming thanks to the masterful direction of Hitchcock and wonderful, convincing performances from Stewart and Novak. The plot twists and turns when you least expect it, so be prepared to bring your mind to the film. You'll need it.My Grade: A-",Vertigo
170,bankofmarquis,One of the best films of all time,10,12 January 2018,"If you've only encountered the films of Alfred Hitchcock through scary films like PSYCHO and THE BIRDS then you are missing out on the bulk of his work and some of the finest motion pictures ever made. I had the privilege of checking out one of his best films, VERTIGO, on the big screen as part of the EMAGINE WILLOW CREEK's SECRET CINEMA series - and what a treat it was.Starring Jimmy Stewart and Kim Novak, VERTIGO is a film about obsession, desire, deception and murder all told in a package by the great Hitchock that pops off the screen and into your brain. EVERY part of this film works and it still holds up 60 years after it's release.Stewart stars as John ""Scotty"" Ferguson a former Police Detective who must retire from the force because of his severe acrophobia (fear of heights) heightened by vertigo. He is asked by a friend to follow his wife, Madeleine (Kim Novak) for fear that she is suicidal. I won't spoil what happens from there, but Hitchcock puts us on the trail of a psychological thriller where Scotty is both the hero and the heel - a real balancing act to pull off and one that needs a beloved actor like Jimmy Stewart in order to be successful. We instantly start liking - and trusting - Scotty from the beginning only to start to lose our trust of him as the events unfold. Stewart's performance is one of the best of his career and holds our attention throughout.Equally captivating is Novak's portrayal of the suicidal wife, Madeleine, who is equal parts beautiful, mysterious and cagey. Without giving too much away, Scotty starts to fall for Madeleine and with Novak's performance, I can see why. She has the trickier part to play in this film and plays the layers of her character well. But this is a Hitchcock film through and through - and shows a top director at the top of his game. From the opening note of Bernard Hermann's off-kilter score to the use of color, place and camera movement, Hitchcock keeps the viewer off-center throughout the film, immersing us in a world that is not quite real, not quite false, which mirrors the reality (or un-reality) that Scotty is dealing with himself.If you have not seen this film, I strongly recommend that you do. If you have not seen this film on the large screen, I doubly strongly encourage you to do so. as it will be theaters on March 18 & 21 as part of Turner Classic Movie's Big Screen Classics film series.Vertigo was recently sited by the BFI Site and Sound poll as the best film of all time, and while I don't quite share that rating of it, I do rate it as ONE of the top films of all time.Letter Grade: A+10 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)",Vertigo

'Vertigo' does so perfectly with one of the most memorable opening scenes ever made. The story only gets better as the main part of the plot begins with retired Detective Scottie Ferguson being recruited to trail a rich man's wife. There seem to be supernatural forces at work, or at least some sort of intense obsession. The way Hitchcock designed it, hold your interest like most of his other films. The acting of solid and the human emotions real and believable without any cheese. However, I still cannot see this film as being Hitchcock's definite classic and certainly not as his masterpiece.It is a very solid film, but the pace really slows down by the second half and it can feel we've been following a trail of cookie crumbs to wind up at a slight downer of a result. Things pick up again for the climax, but it doesn't quite manage to hit your nerve like other Hitchcock pictures. This might be as a result of the fact that the film is essentially confined to very few characters and the relationships are personal, thus there is much more emotional content than physical action (pun not intended). Some of these emotions are brilliantly highlight such as Scottie's dream sequence. However, many of the others, such as Scottie's obsession in finding Madeleine and in buying Judy the right dress in the second part of the film are left purely to acting and thus seem to be lacking that visual flair.However, despite this 'Vertigo' is not a film that can go unrecommended. Though the pace may slow it remains engaging and interesting. And that might be just what makes it a sophisticated film since it doesn't just rely on that trail of bread crumbs to keep the viewer wanting more. It goes through changes and twists and then keeps on going all the way to that haunting climax. It's a bit of a journey through those 2 hours, but it's a good one. --- 8/10Rated PG for some tense scenes. Good for general audiences.",Vertigo
174,FilmOtaku,Hitchcock's psychological masterpiece,8,1 September 2004,"Possible spoilers`Vertigo', Alfred Hitchcock's 1958 film starring James Stewart and Kim Novak is a psychological thriller in which Scottie Ferguson (Stewart) is a retired detective hired to track the daily activities of Madeleine (Novak), the wife of an old college friend who has been exhibiting some disturbing behavior. The problem lies in that Scottie has the medical condition `Vertigo' due to a recent work recent work accident, so anytime he ascends any kind of height, he gets dizzy and ill.  This doesn't appear to hamper his investigation until a crucial moment in the film, but is present throughout. The situation is further complicated when he falls in love with his subject, and the situation eventually spirals out of control, causing permanent damage to everyone involved.`Vertigo' is said to be Hitchcock's masterpiece, and his most personal film. Judging by the disturbing psychosis of the main characters, this would be a pretty interesting thing to explore.  The film could be construed as slow for the first hour or so because there is a lot of character and story development, which leads to a pretty bang up ending.  James Stewart, as always, is excellent, and he certainly breaks type from his `aw shucks' type of role by portraying a severely flawed `hero', but I have never been a friend of Kim Novak's work or herself personally, so I could see just about anyone else in this role and think it would be fine.I'm not entirely sure why I've always had a soft spot for `Vertigo'.  It is vastly different from all of Hitchcock's other films, and therefore quite different from my personal stable of Hitchcock favorites.  Perhaps it is because the film is so dark, and therefore risky for its time.  It could also be because it IS different from his other work, and therefore it requires embracing.  Regardless of the reason and despite its flaws, `Vertigo' remains a beautifully filmed psychological thriller that is timeless in its themes of obsession and betrayal.  Be sure to pick up a copy of the restored version of the film if you are renting, because the restoration is absolutely gorgeous.--Shelly",Vertigo

176,Atreyu_II,"Not really all that great, but not very bad either",6,23 August 2010,"'Vertigo', now one of the most praised and popular Alfred Hitchcock's films, brought me mixed feelings. The first minutes are very interesting for what happens in them and also because they take place on the rooftops of San Francisco. Then the movies goes to a somewhat slow start but ends up becoming interesting and intriguing from the moment when Madeleine enters in scene. There are also many filming angles which are unique, typical from The Master of Suspense, as well as some lovely vistas: the streets of San Francisco, the Fort Point (near the Golden Gate Bridge), the San Francisco Bay, the Mission San Juan Bautista...While Madeleine is on screen, the movie is good, but after she disappears the movie loses its interest. Scottie becomes obsessed with an unpretty woman named Judy who doesn't look like Madeleine at all (but somehow, for him she does). Eventually she transforms to the point of looking almost identical to Madeleine and apparently (which I find ridiculous) she *is* the same person. The ending is good, though, as it takes us one more time to the Mission San Juan Bautista.James Stewart offers a good performance as Scottie and his acrophobia problem. Kim Novak is very good as the beautiful and lovely (however with a problem of major depression) Madeleine. Her look as Madeleine is simple and old-fashioned but an example of classic beauty: attractive, classy, undeniable pretty and charming. It's hard to believe that the same actress portrayed the completely different in every way Judy.In conclusion, a movie that doesn't completely satisfy but also doesn't totally disappoint. However, it does not live up to its status and fame, being clearly overrated.",Vertigo

180,rebeljenn,"psychological thriller, excellent performances",7,2 May 2006,"'Vertigo' is an engaging film about a detective who has a fear of heights and is led to follow a woman whose husband fears is possessed. While spying on the woman, the main character falls in love with her and saves her life. He vows to protect her, but his fear of heights prevents him from doing all that he can do. The film is a psychological thriller with some humour and romance. The scenes are beautiful and meaningful with pacing that adds to the story and adds to the psychology of the characters. The attention to detail is just as good in this film as it is in the other Hitchcock films. The acting is also done well with believable performances given by all. The female lead puts on a remarkable performance playing the possessed woman.The only complaint I have about this film is the ending, from the disaster until the end of the film.

Vertigo is one of if not the best textured films ever made. The costumes, the shots, the score all fuse to make one perfect picture. The style of the film is tempered but yet the story progresses,as Scottie is steadily drawn into the compounding mystery. Which ends with a bang. And then we witness one of the worst disasters in film history. After Scottie first meets Judy, she starts to write a letter revealing what really happened-before destroying it. This is the only false note in the movie and I find it tragic to watch.Imagine if we continued to proceed with Scottie and then were hit with the final revelation at the end when we see the necklace and realize Judy is Madeleine. Which would have had 10 times the effect than knowing fully ahead of time what went on. This was Hitchcock's original vision but after drawing criticism from previews audiences he altered the ending. The film still received harsh reviews and posterity is left with a slightly inferior version.One aspect of Vertigo that is absolutely phenomenal is something I normally don't care for. The opening credits.
Too often are credits a superfluous, boring, ritual that weigh down the start of the movie. But the opening credits to Vertigo set the tone beautifully and truly capture the essence of the film. They are also a technical landmark in film history, making Vertigo the first movie to use computer animation.If you consider yourself someone who loves movies and haven't seen this film I advise that you immediately correct that mistake. Anyway, just one look at the poster should be enough to rouse interest.Vertigo is a film that will haunt you after the first time you see it.

There is yet another brainy bespectacled sidekick for Scottie in the tradition of Shadow of a Doubt and Strangers on a Train.

One capable detective from San Francisco was haunted by memories of a tragedy that occurred on a night chase for one criminal. He stars being afraid of heights after those events. Withdrawal from work is an obvious choice. He enjoys the company of a romantic painter, who is in platonic love with him. However, he accepts the detective work, trying to help an old friend, whose wife suffers from a mental disorder. He becomes an important link in the game of conspiracy and intrigue...The story is very complex, interesting, tense and anxious. A romantic adventure between cruel secrets and unfathomable mystery. Mr. Hitchcock has toyed with intrigue, identity and dreams in this film. Powerful psychological reviews permeate between dream and reality. The main protagonists are torn between deceit and obsession. Soundtrack is very important and well corresponded with slower plots. Hitch has established a lighter pace, in order to show essential details.Scenery is magical. Something between fog and sleep. Characterization is almost perfect.James Stewart as John ""Scottie"" Ferguson has managed to combine tension, informality and obsession in one character. He is a victim and avenger"" at the same time. The difference between love and obsession is very small. His guilt turns into anger and disbelief. This is the first film in which Mr. Stewart does not dominate in the usual way. Kim Novak as Judy Barton/Madeleine Elster is, due to the dual role, quite amazing. Her acting is not at a high level. However, she is stylish, eerily beautiful and enigmatic. She is torn by internal struggles between love and truth. Characters are not honest. None of them. This is very interesting.

184,barryrd,"Vertigo, a powerful and beautiful movie",10,2 March 2009,"A double identity thriller to surpass all others, Vertigo draws viewers into the mind of one man and his obsession with the beautiful woman he is hired to follow. The plot: A detective named Scotty (James Stewart) is asked by a former college buddy to follow his wife Madeleine (Kim Novak), who he says is possessed by a personage from the past.
Scotty accepts the job with misgivings but he soon becomes as much a voyeur as a detective, as he falls madly in love.To Scotty, Madeleine is a beautiful and mysterious woman. She captivates him to the point where I had trouble distinguishing between reality and dreams. Vertigo plays with your mind that way because it is brilliantly crafted. While recovering from a serious fall brought on by vertigo, Scotty is longing for a change from his girlfriend and anchor Midge, played by Barbara Bel Geddes.
As Madeleine, Kim Novak never looked better. Madeleine's double Judy has speech and mannerisms quite different from Madeleine but Scotty tries to shape her into the image of Madeleine and comes very close to success. We want him to make it work but I mage vs. reality can lead into dangerous territory, as we find out.
The visuals of this movie are stunning from the opening credits, to the flashback scenes, to tours by car of San Francisco. The riveting female presence of Madeleine in the movie is captured early by close-ups as she passes by the camera. The viewer is drawn into Scotty's obsession and can feel the power of Madeleine's magnetism, when the camera closes in on her. How Hitchcock achieves this is one of the hallmarks of this powerful movie.
The vertigo is shown by a series of shots from high above ground level which gives us a sense of Scotty's harrowing fear of heights. When Scotty is hired to follow Madeleine, we tour San Francisco in a slow-moving vehicle up and down hills, past great public edifices and apartments. The film highlights the white plaster buildings set amid the greenery of the city and the blue and green colour of San Francisco Bay.
The music by Bernard Hermann is perfect, although there were parts in the movie where the orchestral music became jarring. This is a small point given the style, the beauty, and the story line of this mesmerizing movie. I don't think younger audiences are familiar with this movie, certainly one of Hitchcock's one or two best.",Vertigo

187,RJBurke1942,Where a dizzy plot and story leave this viewer behind...,6,2 January 2013,"When I first saw this movie in 1959, I was bored to tears, almost. As a teenager, I wanted action, and the film and story seemed to be lacking in that regard. Only when Psycho (1960) came along did my appreciation of Hitchcock increase. As to Vertigo's story, the above short synopsis from filmfactsman provides sufficient information for those who haven't seen the movie.However, over fifty years later, I watched Vertigo for a second time and I must say my initial assessment was similar: the film's action drags with too much walking, shadowing and following, coupled with too much driving, following and shadowing. Appropriate jump-cutting could have been used a number of times – and shorten viewers' pains in the process, I think.On the flip side though, I can now fully appreciate Hitchcock's filming technique to show how Scottie Ferguson (James Stewart) grapples with the mystery of Madeleine Elster (Kim Novak) and how he unravels it. Though I'm sure there were more shot-reverse shot sequences in this movie than in any other of Hitchcock's.However, what the film truly lacks overall, in my opinion, is effective suspense – sufficient to keep this viewer fully interested in what will happen, and when and why. Hence, it's even a more of a puzzle to me why Vertigo has now replaced Citizen Kane (1941) as ""the best movie of all time"" (or words to that effect). Sure, both stories are mysteries, but the latter packs more of a punch for viewers from the get-go; and the revelation at the end provides greater dramatic irony than that in Vertigo. Indeed, one could argue that Vertigo's irony is weak, at best, and just corny at worst.Moreover, one wonders how a supposedly intelligent ex-cop could be so stupid to be sucked in twice by the same – but different – woman. Love is blind, I guess, as always.And, finally, the entire story of Vertigo is just too predictable, in addition to having a dialog that's just plain dull much of the time. Technically, as I implied, the actual filming is excellent, as you would expect from Hitchcock; and the color is just so vividly vibrant. But that's not enough for me to regard it as anything more than just that: a well-constructed film with few errors.James Stewart – always more effective in comedy and westerns, in my opinion – is just not right for the role. Kim Novak, on the other hand, is most effective, providing her best acting role that I've seen. And, as always, Barbara Bel Geddes is a most suitable supporting player as one of Stewart's old flames.I'm glad I've seen the movie again. And I do recommend it for all Hitchcock fans, for sure. But it's no where near his best effort: too long, too slow, too predictable and too light on suspense. Give this one six out of ten – and I'm being generous.January 2nd, 2013",Vertigo

This movie is the closest Hitch comes to fully expressing his inner demons to nearly being explicit.  The beginning of this film can be seen as a continuation of Rear Window.  Vertigo (1958) also deals with some similar themes explored in Rear Window (1954).  This is the third film that deals with a person's mental state.  The other two being Spellbound (1946), which dealt with a man's fear of white, and Marnie (1964), which dealt with the main character's fear of red.

Navigates London, time and place can be read and contained.  Scottie Ferguson.  Obviously not detached.  He can't read material world because it doesn't exist, for two reasons: one, the world he sees has been created by someone else, a god/author figure, Gavin Elster, who like a good director gives Scottie a synopsis and a general idea of the plot, and then lets the actor (remember Hitch called them 'cattle') think he's improvising.Two, because even if the world wasn't an illusion, Scottie's vision is.  He cannot interpret what's in front of him, because he can't see it.  No more than any of us can.  Even before he begins the Madeleine/Carlotta chase, he first sees her at Ernie's, but not for what she is, a woman in a restaurant, but bathed in a strange, 'unrealistically' motivated glow.In Joyce's Ulysses, Stephen Daedelus distinguishes between Plato's  realm of 'formless' ideality, with Aristotle's more material philosophy, 'what you d--- well have to see'.  VERTIGO points up the shortsightedness of this viewpoint - Scottie sees what he sees, but it is a world of formless ideality.

Yes it's 'about' cinema, about the male spectator especially, about the self-destructive passivity of active desire.  Like 'The Great Gatsby', its corresponding text in literature, VERTIGO  is about illusory lives, dreams, and the unattainable girl.  But VERTIGO complicates this.  VERTIGO is not told only from the point of view of Scottie, or the omniscient 'narrator'/director who subtly undermines him.  VERTIGO, unlike 'Gatsby', or 'Lolita', gives its heroine a voice.  We are allowed to see what she sees and thinks.  Scenes are coloured by her emotion, just as they are for Scottie.  See how they both visualise Ernie's, for example: Scottie's expansive, enquiring, free point of view and Judy's broken, Sirkian, experience, foregounding intruding decor and different levels, like shattered fragments.VERTIGO is Judy's tragedy - Scottie is actually offered a woman who will love him early, who will humiliate, negate, even kill herself for him; Judy loves someone who doesn't even know she exists.  But her Scottie doesn't exist either - like Heathcliff awaiting his Cathy, he is in another realm.

193,the red duchess,Unfathomable.(spoilers),10,15 August 2001,"It has become one of the cliches in talking about 'Vertigo' that it is Hitchcock's most personal work, a naked confession of his desires for blonde actresses in general, for Vera Miles (who was originally intended to play Madeleine/Judy) in particular.  In this model, Scottie Ferguson who makes over Judy Barton in the image of another woman and destroys her in process, is Hitchcock making over Kim Novak in the image of a pregnant Vera Miles. 
This is all well and good, if a little facile, but isn't the true Hitchcock altar-ego in 'Vertigo', a man whose place of business is introduced by Hitchcock's cameo, Gavin Elster?  The seemingly stolid, amiable craftsman creating mad, mind-bending murder plots, and then disappearing for ever, just as Hitchcock creates in 'Vertigo' a truly Borgesian labyrinth without a centre, lets generations of critics loose in it, and vanishes with the map? The plot of 'Vertigo' is pure illusion, a phantom narrative starring a possessing ghost, formerly an actress; in trying to recreate a phantom, to become Gavin Elster, to possess a possessed woman (in both senses - by Carlotta Valdes; by Elster), Scottie merely duplicates and proliferates more and more phantoms until he wanders around in a world that doesn't exist.There is a school of thought that presuasively argues that 'Vertigo' is a Surrealist film - one critic even suggests that Scottie dies at the beginning (and how on earth was he rescued from a rotting gutter; by the criminal?), and that the rest of the film is a dream.  this is convincing because the film follows a dream logic, in its repetition, overlaying and transformation of scenes, characters, motifs, colours etc.  When Scottie has the famous nightmare after Madeleine's death, the nocturnal view of Scottie, with 'SP' blazing in neon that began the film, with Scottie and the policeman pursuing a miscreant, is repeated here.  Why?One thing is for certain, this nightmare sequence is the key moment in 'Vertigo'.  There is a pattern in the film where characters take on the characteristics of other characters, like ghosts, most obviously in the case of Judy and Madeleine.  In the film's second half, Scottie begins with his mind blasted, emptied of his own personality.  He begins it leaving a mental institution.  He is ready to become someone else.  He wants, both unwittingly and, after the discovery of the necklace, consciously, to become Elster, the creator of the film, the potent God who created a world and convinced his actors it was the real one.  The man who got away. 
Scottie fails to become Elster because he becomes Madeleine, another of Elster's creations. Madeleine tells Scottie the imprecise details of a recurring dream she has - Scottie in his nightmare enacts her dream and her fate.  The end of the film will see him trying to extricate himself from his role and his Creator, but he will only repeat it, once again causing an 'innocent' woman to die for his own masculine vanity. 
The film is full of blatant visual imagery expressing male and female principles, but it is Scottie who is feminised, who ends the film paralysed in a vaginal arch, just as earlier he stood in his doorway and Elster's actress stood with (the sardonically named) Coit Tower behind her.  These arches are not just the female principles Scottie gets lost in, they are the proscenium arches of master playwright Elster, whose signature is found throughout the film, right from their first meeting, he relating his plot on a stage, Scottie the audience listening.  'Vertigo' was recently shown at the Irish Film Centre on 70mm.  Some clown fouled up the sound.  Normally this would be a vandalism punishable only by torture, but this time it gave me a chance to do something I'd always wanted to do, but was always prevented by Hitchcock's narrative intractibility - follow the story through the paintings.  There are so many paintings in every room in 'Vertigo' (and in Scottie's is one of those scientific patterns of the opening credits, linking him again to the female object). 
In Midge's study, the images of the female are fetishistically Surreal, fragments of the female body and their clothes (just as Scottie is decapitated/castrated in his nightmare) - in one painting above her sofa, where Scottie lies, surrounded by pictures of women, is an abstract study of fragments as if an explosion has just taken place.  In Elster's room, ships naturally predominate, especially a storm scene where light on the left where Scottie stands meets the dark turbulence on Elster's, the side Scottie will cross into.  The sound, I'm afraid, came back, and I once again got lost in the labyrinth, but I'm determined to do this properly some day.  I did like the child with the code in the gallery behind Scottie (Carlotta's child?  The child none of the characters have?), and the forest scene in the mental hospital, reminding us of the sequoias.Still the greatest.",Vertigo
194,FlickJunkie-2,A Hitchcock Masterpiece,10,2 January 2001,"Many believe that this was greatest work of a master renowned for the outstanding direction of suspense thrillers.  Alfred Hitchcock creates a vortex of emotion and deception in this classic film about obsession.There are so many complex themes to this story that it requires several viewings to appreciate.  It metamorphoses numerous times, shifting from a detective story, to a love story, to a murder mystery, and finally to neurotic obsession.  It is a deep character study of flawed characters. Some are not what they appear to be and others change before our eyes.Hitchcock's direction is superb, not only from the standpoint of assembling the story, but from a technical perspective as well.  The photography, lighting and perspectives are brilliantly done and locations wonderfully selected, especially the shots at the foot of the Golden Gate Bridge. Hitchcock also brings forth outstanding performances from Kim Novak and James Stewart.  Stewart generally played admirable and heroic characters in his career so the deeply flawed John Ferguson was a clear departure for him. This is probably his best and most gut wrenching performance and I don't think it would have been possible without Hitchcock's direction because Hitchcock was the master of bringing such characters to life.  Novak and Barbara Bel Geddes (most famous as Miss Ellie on TV's `Dallas') also give excellent performances.Bernard Herrmann's musical score is superlative.  It is beautiful, compelling and chilling and brought additional power to almost every scene. Hitchcock had such great respect for Herrmann that he stated during production that whether the scenes of the film worked or not depended completely on the music Herrmann would write.  He trusted that Herrmann would create just the right mood, and he was correct.The DVD version presents us with a completely restored version of the film with rich color and powerful sound.  The new DVD is the only way to watch this film if one hopes to experience it the way it was originally presented in 1958.This film is ranked number 61 on AFI's top 100 movies of the century.  I rated it a 10/10.  It was virtually ignored at the Academy Awards garnering only two nominations for set decoration and sound.  However, it endures in the opinion of many as one of the best suspense thrillers ever made.",Vertigo
195,griffolyon12,A Sad Disappointment,4,27 June 2010,"It's always tough to be the odd man out, it's even harder to be just that on a film by one of your favorite filmmakers. Alfred Hitchcock's Vertigo is often considered one of the all-time greats for the Master of Suspense, and it really pains me to disagree with the vast majority, but that is how these things often go.Vertigo tells the story of a retired San Francisco detective played by Jimmy Stewart who suffers from vertigo. Stewart's character is hired by an old friend to tale the friend's wife who has been exhibiting odd behavior recently, her husband believing she is channeling the spirit of a 19th century woman. The premise is well set up, and the starting paces play out superbly, but when the story starts trying to explain all of the supernatural with a Sherlock Holmes-style deduction, I find the film hard to swallow. The film becomes more far-fetched when it tries to explain realistically all of the supernatural events rather than just letting it be a ghost story. As well, the romance between the characters played by Stewart and Kim Novak, who portrays the woman Stewart is following, just develops too quickly to be believable.As I said, it pains me to talk such as this. The film had been so built up before I finally saw it, that I guess I expected something completely different than what I got, but what I got was something that started out as one thing, and then midway through the film transformed into another that just negated all of the things I loved about the first half of the film. Want my advice, if you love Hitch, try Rear Window or North by Northwest. Way more suspense, way more mystery, and way more fun.I give Vertigo a 4 out of 10!",Vertigo
196,davidcarniglia,"""Well, You Don't Look Like Jack the Ripper""",10,17 December 2020,"This time around on this Hitchcock classic, I noticed that Stewart's role is set up very much like his reporter character in Rear Window. Hes recovering from an accident, and has a girlfriend/buddy least looking after/out for him. In this case though, Stewart's character Scottie has another issue--suffering from vertigo as a result of nearly being killed falling off a building.Like Marnie, Novak's Madeline is one of Hitchcock disturbed females needing to get fixed, as it were. Somewhat inadvertently, he attempts just that; ostensibly in the course of following her about at the behest of her husband and his friend, Gavin. Nothing like a double identity to confuse matters for Scottie--maybe triple identity: Madeline/Carlotta/Judy. Midge is Madeline's opposite; secure, perky and loyal, she's the girl next door to Madeline's seemingly ethereal origin.By the time of the climatic scene at the mission, San Juan Bautista, it's hard to say whether Scottie or Madeline is more messed up. Both of them have been on a surreal journey into her past; relieved only by interludes with Midge. Madeline's suicide (?), coming quickly after the near-miss by the Golden Gate Bridge, hardly means that Scottie had a better grip on reality than he. The inquest has all the charm of a Puritanical witch trial, except that no one is really on the hot seat. Well, Scottie is negligent, but gets off Scot-free (!)Ending up in a catatonic state (""acute melancholia"", according to his doctor), Scottie is a mental handful for Midge. She knows that his recovery won't be swift. But he climbs out of it physically. He's stalked by his mind, putting him back in places familiar to Madeline.Ok, but who's this Judy? (Novak 2.0). No wonder Scottie zeroes in on her. She actually accepts a dinner date from him; these days he'd not even make it inside her place. Aha! denouement number two shows that she indeed is Madeline. I guess that's what you have to do when your husband pretends to kill you, and the corpse was a dummy. Oh those normal-looking guys like Gavin are the sneakiest. Well, Scottie isn't satisfied with a second date; he basically wants to 'keep' her.Well, he gets his wish. She's his doll. He not only wants her, he wants her to be Madeline. ""I wish you'd leave me alone, I wanna go away!"" First the clothes, then her hair--let's get it right! ""Then will you love me?"" As bad as it all is, she's playing a game with him. Ghostly as she emerges from the gauzy light, as Madeline, she completely beguiles him. So, what's going to happen?When he sees she's wearing the same brooch as the one in the gallery painting, he slips back into relive-the-past mode. Meaning back to the mission, scene of the 'suicide'. Shes none to happy about reliving this deal. He's onto her now; the plot she got into with her husband. ""I was the set-up, wasn't I?"" So Gavin could get rid of his real wife, and have Madeline. Well, thanks to a curious nun, Madeline's spooked, and this time she does fall to her death. The end.We could divide Vertigo into halves, each ending with a trip to the mission. I don't quite grasp how the inquest could come off so smooth without the correct body; but I suppose Gavin had ways to fix that--it's too much to believe that even these inquisitors were all in on it. Given that nod to suspension of disbelief, this is still a tough nut to crack.Essentially, Scottie is both the protagonist and (his own) antagonist. That explains that while he tries to influence events, he's pretty much moving a step back for each step forward. that's more apparent in the second part of the movie. We can almost see his mind working; what seems like nothing more than a creepy come on to Judy looks simultaneously like he thinks--he's been fooled.The obvious question is how he was able to find her--she wanted to be found, because she indeed love him. the immediate problem, though, is that he is the only one who can discover that she's Madeline; that is, something fishy is up. this is the ultimate star-crossed romance.Even if Madeline doesn't (ironically, by accident) fall down the church steeple, she's 'fallen' in another way; she's an accessory to murder. Not to mention that along the way, Scottie falls in love with the woman whom is his friends wife (supposedly); then he thinks she's died, almost dies mentally for awhile, can't forget her, meets her look-alike, gets very obsessively creepy, and...isn't that enough?This is such a powerful film that it's emotionally exhausting; it involves the viewer, first for the mystery, then the romance; then both at once. Another compelling suspect is the use of color: all these bright sunny days in the city, bundles of flowers, the white pre-skyscraper San Francisco, even Scottie's immaculate white car. Juxtaposed to these slashes of purity and joy are the gaudy blood-red interior of the restaurant, and especially the icy mint greens playing along the walls and windows of Judy's apartment (also Madeline's car, her dress in the first restaurant scene, etc.).I'm left with the feeling that guys who have unrequited love may have latched onto this movie (that really looks like her...hey it is her!), and then been left hanging because the lady turns out to be an (perhaps unwitting) criminal, and then dies into the bargain.A must see for Hitchcock fans--I should say, a must to see again, as surely almost all of those folks have seen it more than once already.",Vertigo
197,RossRivero99,The Best movie of 1958,10,18 May 2014,"Alfred Hitchcock's Vertigo is a true suspense movie masterpiece with James Stewart giving a towering performance as a retired San Francisco detective who is suffering from acrophobia investigates the strange activities of an old friend's wife, and while becoming dangerously obsessed with her. The girl who Ferguson gets obsessed with is played by a young Kim Novak. What Hitchcock tries to do with all of his movies is try to put all of the suspenseful moments where they absolutely need to be including with this movie as well. Also Stewart was absolutely perfect for this part in this great movie. But it was the love story that made the movie even more suspenseful, just like his 1955 film To Catch a Thief. Also this film entertained me from start to finish, I would recommend this movie because I thought it was a movie worth watching from my perspective.",Vertigo
198,Eumenides_0,Hitchcock's Study of Madness and Obsession,8,17 February 2010,"In my first viewing of Vertigo, the movie let me down. It wasn't until I watched it again that I began rejoicing in its beauty and artistic quality, and even if today it's not one of my favorite movies, at least I've grown to respect it.James Stewart plays Scottie, a San Francisco detective hired by an old friend to watch his wife, Madeleine: the husband thinks she's suffering from a mental disease in which she imagines herself being possessed by the spirit of a woman who killed herself. Scottie investigates her and eventually falls in love with her; he tries to help her overcome her belief that a spirit is possessing her, but in the end she kills herself just like the other woman.The first part of the movie is a tense thriller, but it's the second part that really makes the movie the masterpiece it is. In it we discover how far a man will go to recover the love of a dead woman. Necrophilia, although the word is never used in this movie, is never too distant.Stewart is amazing in the movie. The movie was a commercial failure and Hitchcock blamed it on Stewart's age, but for me the frail, slightly bumbling personality that he gave Scottie makes him one of the most interesting detectives in the history of cinema. And when he lets out all the darkness in his soul in the second part of the movie, then he reaches new heights of perversion.But Kim Novak also deserves recognition for her performance, in which she must display several personalities over multiple roles.This movie is not as exciting as Hitchcock's The Birds or North By Northwest: these are exciting movies that never stop; North By Northwest is a chase movie so it's always in motion; and The Birds has an atmosphere of dread that keeps the viewer on the edge even not much is happening. But Vertigo is Hitchcock doing a character study about obsession, love, insanity and jealousy.The first sequence in the movie, a chase scene on rooftops, is followed by slower, but tense, scenes of detective work in which time slows down so the viewer can appreciate Scottie's mind at work as he puts the evidence together in Madeleine's mysterious case. Little by little the movie picks up its pace until the becomes a roller-coaster of tension by the end.Two things stood out for me in the movie: the cinematography in its use of colors, especially green; we see it in all the key moments, whether in the trees, in Madeleine's costume or in neon lights. Also, the use of depth to portray Scottie's fear of heights - hence the vertigo of the title - was very imaginative.And secondly, one cannot disregard Bernard Hermann's tragic score for the movie. Built on the music for Tristan and Isolde, Herrmann's score is perfect for a movie about doomed love: it's melancholy and dreamy. The movie wouldn't have been the same without the score's tone of tragedy it brought to it.",Vertigo
199,Horror-yo,"Fine, but over-hyped",7,28 June 2016,"As with many such films, this one starts out with a very intriguing premise which tension only builds up as the elements of the plot flourish more and more towards the middle of the development... before stalling some during the last third of the film, somewhat toning down the fine quality of the early viewing. This film is too long for its own good, and has a bit of a rare 'symptom' of peaking too soon. It seems all the pressure fomented in the first hour is already resolved well before the final act of the film, and although there is certainly matter to the second half of the story, a lot of the essential atmosphere and purpose the film was subtly weaving for a while are put to sleep before a different kind of tone or 'color' (*wink wink*) completely takes over - one that is much more obvious, ordinary, maybe somewhat tedious. The first half is so mysterious, intimate, smooth, suspenseful, hauntingly romantic... and all this is traded away for a more conventional affair. Finally, the very title of the film seems a little misleading if not a lot, especially given this is a Hitchcock, where one would really expect something different and isn't necessarily given a worthy compensation for it. Overall, it's a fine film, but weaker in some respects than it seems it is given credit for.",Vertigo
200,oOoBarracuda,Vertigo,8,2 November 2016,"In 2012, Sight and Sound dethroned Citizen Kane as the best film of all time, ending a 50-year reign as the top film. The film in which they named the best film, was Alfred Hitchcock's Vertigo. Made in 1958 starring James Stewart and Kim Novak; I was really looking forward to seeing what so many thought was a superior film to the god-like Citizen Kane masterpiece. Vertigo explores obsession and how deeply obsession can take root and the disastrous effects that can have on everyone involved. When a retired San Fransisco detective is asked to do a favor for a friend, and obsession takes root, lives are changed forever. John 'Scottie' Ferguson (James Stewart), a retired detective living in San Fransisco, has been forced to leave his job as a debilitating case of acrophobia, or, vertigo has taken control of him after being involved in a roof-top chase resulting in the death of a subject. Adjusting to a more low-key life, Scottie is spending a lot of time connecting with friends, such re-connections have led him to an old college friend, Gavin Elster (Tom Helmore). Gavin shares with Scottie that his wife has been exhibiting some odd behaviors, in which she has episodes in which she seems to believe that she is the reincarnation of a deceased ancestor. Gavin explains that she experiences these episodes, then abruptly comes out of them, never remembering what she experienced while she was enduring the episode. Gavin asks Scottie to follow his wife, Madeleine Elster (Kim Novak) as he is concerned for her sanity. Scottie obliges, and as he begins to follow her, he gets to know her and almost instantly falls in love with her. Scottie doesn't just fall in love with Madeleine, though, he becomes deeply obsessed with her. After saving her life several times from her attempted suicides, Scottie is unable to save her when she climbs to the top of a bell tower she intends to jump from, due to his vertigo. After several months of brooding after his obsession, Scottie feels magnetically drawn to a woman who looks just like Madeleine and takes her shopping and to die her hair so she may look identical to his obsession. Scottie was making a woman in Madeleine's image until he realizes he has been duped by an intricate puzzle he has unknowingly been a part of. I'm a sucker for openings and movie introductions. Vertigo opens in a brilliant way with an equally as brilliant introduction to Kim Novak as the stunning beauty that kidnaps the eye in the restaurant scene. The colors in this film are fantastic and all of Hitchcock's trials with color come to wonderful fruition with Vertigo. A psychological thriller to end all thrillers, Vertigo is a wonderfully intricate puzzle which is a superb treat for the audience to piece together. Technically, Vertigo is a film to study by anyone interesting in filmmaking or understanding films on a deeper plane and artistic level. The shot composition is divine in Vertigo, creating a work of art in each scene. I am quite partial to Jimmy Stewart and thought he did a wonderful job in the complex role of Scottie. One thing that has always struck me about Vertigo was how unfairly blamed Stewart was for the failure of the film. Vertigo was not commercially or critically successful upon its release, and he shouldered much of this blame on Jimmy Stewart. Hitchcock and Stewart had worked together three times previously, and their fourth film, Vertigo would be their last because Hitch thought someone like another stock actor of his, Cary Grant, would have brought more sex appeal to the role and producing a better final product. Unfortunately, Hitch seems to miss all that Stewart brings to the role, the deliberate motions, and movements that Grant would have faltered with. In any regard, Vertigo has etched a place in history and for just cause as a true illustration of Hitchcock's mastery.",Vertigo

But in this particular movie it doesn't seem to fit in, I can imagine the plot of the movie happening in another movie and it would be the same, nothing special or shocking. Also the acting was exaggerated. on a personal note: I'm not a fan of Hitchcock so I wasn't expecting to enjoy much but I still tried to watch the movie and see if I can appreciate this director but it seems that even if I understand the plot and the ending, I just don't love the movie nor the director.

Then, the last 30 minutes are a burden, the story struggling to get a second wind, until a ruined final outcome, far too abrupt.It's a shame because the potential was there but the end result lacks consistency, homogeneity, and the movie doesn't seem fully accomplished, at least not enough to rank it as one of the director's best nor as an all-time great.As always with Hitchcock, the direction and mise-en-scène are good.

To tell more of the plot would ruin the movie because it's complicated with many twists and surprises. The film takes place in San Francisco and along the California coast. If you like Hitchcock's films and the movie Vertigo run out and get Donald Spoto's book ""The Art of Alfred Hitchcock"" and read his detailed essay on Vertigo. It reveals all the symbolism and underlying structure of the film which you're not aware of as you watch. When you see the film again you'll be amazed at the complexity of the movie and what it really is about. I had no idea of what Hitchcock was doing in his films until I read the essays in Spoto's book. They're a real eye opener, especially the essay on Vertigo.Vertigo is #61 on the American Film Institute's 100 greatest films list. If you like Vertigo check out the 1955 film Les Diaboliques by Henri Georges-Clouzot. It was based on a book by the same author, Pierre Boileau, who wrote the book on which Vertigo is based.

208,chaswe-28402,Ultra bizarre,5,19 February 2019,"Every aspect of this narrative, right from the beginning, bankrupts credulity. Did Scottie fall from the rooftop ? Why is he in a corset ? If he fell, why isn't he as dead as the previous policeman ? Perhaps he is actually dead throughout the film. The scenes with Barbara Bel Geddes are the only natural ones in the whole movie, and she seems like the only genuine human being anywhere around. Moving on to the villainous Gavin Elster's scheme for murdering his wife, this has to be the weirdest plan that was ever devised. One wonders how it was presented in the original book.As the story progresses, and the virtually insane murder plan for exploiting Scottie's vertigo becomes a little clearer, each incident grows progressively more peculiar. Why does Madeleine go into the flower shop from the back door ? Perhaps it's the only place she can park her car. How does she manage to vanish from the hotel ? Is Scottie hallucinating ? If so, why would he be ? Is he being presented as an incorrigible congenital victim ?Moving on to Scottie's sudden recovery from his melancholia, unhelped by Mozart (several weeks ? A year ?), we enter the next phase of this impossible tale - the discovery of Judy from Salina, Kansas. Except for the colour of her hair, she is clearly absolutely identical, down to each eyebrow, with the allegedly deceased ex-Mrs Madelaine Elster, and only a blind man could suppose otherwise.Count me out. I can only think that Hitchcock planned to amuse himself by inducing vertigo in his audience. This is just not a good film. Unrewarding in every way. I identify with Scottie, as a dupe.

210,domino1003,Hitchcock and Stewart deliver a Classic,10,15 September 2005,"I have been a die-hard fan of ""Vertigo"" for over 10 years, having seen it over again and again, but up until now I could not put into words about how I felt about the film until now. And so here I go, pulling you the reader of this review into a story of obsessive love and serious phobias.As the film opens, we see Detective ""Scottie"" Ferguson (James Stewart), in pursuit of a criminal with a fellow officer. As he tries to jump across a roof, he slips and falls, hanging on for dear life. The fellow officer, in an attempt to help him, falls to his death. It seems that he has acrophobia, which causes his vertigo and forces him to retire from the force, feeling guilt about the officer's death. Sometime later, while visiting with his former girlfriend Midge (Barbara Bel Geddes), Scottie tells her about Galvin Elster (Tom Helmore), a former college friend that needs his help. It seems that Elster's wife Madeleine (Kim Novak)is acting a bit strange: she goes into trances and disappears for hours without being able to account to her whereabouts. Scottie at first doesn't want anything to do with this. One look at Madeleine however changes his mind. From the moment he lays his eyes on her, he's hooked.While tailing her, he finds that she is obsessed with an ancestor of hers: an ancestor that went mad and killed herself. Scottie manages to save her from such an attempt (She tries to drown herself in the San Francisco Bay). He starts to fall for her HARD.During an attempt to help her at the San Juan Batista Mission, Madeleine runs from Scottie and up the tower. Scottie, unable to continue up the tower because of his acrophobia, can only watch in horror as Madeleine falls to her death. The death of the woman that he had fallen in love with is more than he can bear and it drives him to a nervous breakdown.Sometime later, Scottie, still haunted by Madeleine (And visiting some of her haunts)sees Judy Barton (Novak again), who looks remarkably like Madeleine. Scottie soon becomes obsessed with turning Judy into Madeleine (Even having her sit by the fire the way Madeleine did). Scottie is so desperate to reclaim the love he had for Madeleine that he is oblivious to the deceptions that have been surrounding him: He is truly falling in love with an illusion.All the parts of the film work wonderfully, from Saul Bass' opening titles to Bernard Herrmann's incredibly haunting music. But it is Stewart and Novak that bring the film it's life. When Scottie looks at Judy emerge out of the bathroom as his lost Madeleine, the green light makes her look as if she is truly a ghost, returning from the dead to once again love Scottie.If you have never seen this film, then you are missing one of Alfred Hitchcock's classic films. This is truly a classic film and a must have in your collection. You will absolutely fall in love with the film.",Vertigo
211,lagudafuad,Not as great as they say but fun to watch,6,7 September 2012,"Vertigo is a mystery film in the late 50s that has a way of luring you in till you become hooked to see how it is all going to turn out.I love the nice twist in the ending that makes you know that all that you are watching is just a setup that is if you have not read the book prior to watching this classic.Although many a classics have been made, Vertigo has received many praises which I believe it does not deserve. Viewers may be bored by the lengthy drama, but if you are the kind that loves to see how it is going to turn out, then Vertigo is a movie for you.The film stars James Stewart as former police detective John ""Scottie"" Ferguson, who had to retire due to disabilities (vertigo and clinical depression) incurred when a police colleague died trying to save him.Scottie gets a call from an old friend who hires him as a private investigator to follow his wife, Madeleine Elster (Kim Novak) who is behaving strangely.Scottie begins the job which led to him falling in love and becoming obsessed with his work.The screenplay is an adaptation of the French novel The Living and the Dead (D'entre les morts) by Pierre Boileau and Thomas Narcejac.Although Vertigo is fun to watch, it may be a bore at times and has so many loose ends. Some of the times the camera angles were weird, the use of the zoom to play out the vertigo feeling is to be praised though.Well if you are ready to sit 2 hours for a movie to thrill ya, then vertigo is it.

212,willcundallreview,A bit of Hitchcock never hurts,8,11 July 2015,"Rating-8/10With Alfred Hitchcock you get two things guaranteed, mystery and thrills, and a lot of them. Vertigo is no exception here and Hitchcock creates a movie full of suspense and a kind of eerie feel to it, with a plot that flows very nicely until the very end. Slow in parts and maybe not recommended for all, this is still acted very well and the technical aspects are spot on. Is it a masterpiece?, well I will say here why I don't think it is but though, why it is still a great film to view.The story is all about an ex detective, who finds out he has extreme fear of heights and has to track and old friends wife, unique right and done well too, brilliantly put out there onto the big screen. James Stewart stars and does very well, his calm composure and firm personality make him likable but at times very strange and importantly, mysterious. Kim Novak is also fine in this and her portrayal is also mysterious and she is really the kind of eerie but interesting plot point in this movie.Alfred Hitchcock directs this in a way which is very well done, a kind of slow feel that gradually builds up to the finer moments of the film and makes this movie what it is. It is written well, I didn't think it was fantastic but it is pretty good, it is of course actually an adaptation of ""The Living and the Dead"" and the writers(Alec Coppel and Samuel Taylor) make this very interesting and done well too of course.Now is it the greatest movie of all time?, well for me no but I do highly rate it, just not as high as some others. The reason I can't claim this is the best is because it just isn't enjoyable enough, sure it is engaging but the plot gets kind of thin by the end. I think also it very slow, I mean it can have it's fast moments but some moments are just too slow moving, for me the last half starts to slightly drag but it holds itself together to finish off in it's own unique style.I think a reason many do like it so much, is the depth which I won't deny is there and makes this one heck of an interesting flick. It's the level of acting also coupled with that in depth storyline that make this great, not perfect but pretty excellent. I think Hitchcock knows what is best for this and goes straight for it, he seems to mix the elements finely and it feels as if he put a lot of personal style into this, making it more realistic and less like typical Hollywood made movies. I think the visuals and the camera work make this stand out even more in the history of film, and definitely in the era in which it was made. With finely used camera techniques this becomes a different level for the day, Robert Burks makes this just perfect homework for any budding cinematographer and how to manipulate the cameras view. The score is also a fine one, not great but well done, makes the suspense much more thrilling and the story just a little more engaging. So all in all this for me isn't the very best, but doesn't surprise me why some love it so much, just in this day is it really as important as before?, I'll leave that for anyone out there who wants to answer that. In any case this is a very good movie though and I would recommend it to anyone, and especially to those who call themselves film fans.",Vertigo
213,majikstl,A fall from grace...,3,15 May 2004,"(((((SPOILERS)))))I don't think that I have made an effort to like or, at least, respect any movie more than I have Alfred Hitchcock's VERTIGO. I have seen it maybe half a dozen times on the big and small screens, read reviews and analyses of it, as well as essays about it in a couple of Hitchcock biographies. I recognize just how it fits into Hitchcock's filmography and how it details his notorious obsessions. It is an important film as far as the study of Hitchcock is concerned. But, in the end, VERTIGO is just not a very good movie. I don't see why it is considered to be one of the greatest films of all time; indeed, I wouldn't even place it in Hitchcock's top twenty. Instead of appreciating it more each time I view it, I find myself resenting the way it distracts from Hitchcock's better efforts.The premise -- basically a variation of ""Frankenstein"" by way of a dark and brooding ""My Fair Lady"" -- involves a man's attempt to reshape a woman into the image of a woman he thought he loved and lost, not realizing they are the same woman. The concept is intriguing in theory, but largely unbelievable in execution. The film is told in two halves, the first being a detective story. It involves the type of ludicrously contrived murder scheme that only works in old self-mocking whodunits (""'You see,' explained Nick to Nora, in between sips of his martini, 'Gavin had to use Scottie as his patsy, because a man who was not deathly afraid of heights might have climbed to the top of the bell tower and discovered....'"") You get the idea. Almost like a trial run for the far superior PSYCHO, Hitchcock concocts a convoluted thriller storyline which ultimately only serves as a set up for the psychological drama in the second half. This may be the only aspect of the film that shows Hitchcock's genius: using a far-fetched mystery narrative as a way of luring the viewer into the murkier melodrama that is the real center of the story. But, it seems Hitchcock was so fascinated in elements of the latter part of the story that he wasn't concerned with the plot holes and dubious logic that make the first half largely unbelievable. And, unfortunately, part two is hopelessly entangled in the clumsy web spun in part one.It is part two of the story that also fascinates the film's admirers (who tend to ignore or forgive the sloppy set up of part one). Having established that James Stewart as Scottie, has fallen in love with Kim Novak's Madeline, only to see her apparently commit suicide, the film introduces Judy, also Novak, who is a dead ringer for Madeline. On meeting Judy, one would think that a trained detective like Scottie would immediately be suspicious and begin to investigate her past, instead he starts playing Henry Higgins and begins training Judy to again look and act like ""Madeline."" Judy, who should realize that Scottie can implicate her in a murder, plays along, presumably because she has fallen madly in love with Scottie. But basically, no one does anything logical in this film, everybody being hopeless enslaved by the rather silly plot, rather than by obsessive love or psychological turmoil. The film just doesn't stand up to close scrutiny, either dramatically or psychologically.Okay, films, especially Hitchcock's, are less about plot than style. But even so, the film is substandard, especially for a Hitchcock film. There are a few clever shots and striking images, but that is overshadowed by slow pacing, a very hokey dream sequence and stilted dialogue. And there are some odd choices involving the use of color that prove particularly annoying. At first, I thought the muddy, muted look of the film was the result of badly aged prints, but seeing the restored version proves this not to be the case. And for some reason, Jimmy Stewart's face seems bright orange in every print of the film I have seen. The look of the film is so annoying, that the last time I watched it, I turned the color off on my TV set. The film actually plays better in black and white, reflecting its pulp film noir elements.It seems that the reason the film's reputation has skyrocketed over the years has less to do with Hitchcock's skill at making it, than that VERTIGO represents a convenient checklist of all his phobias, fetishes and obsessive visions. Those who have laboriously defended the film seem to skim over the gaping holes in its logic, dwelling on the film's paper-thin psychology: The film's protagonist Scottie representing Hitchcock and his not-so healthy desire to control and abuse women of a certain type. Okay, maybe that is so. But a psychological profile is not necessarily the same as a work of art -- or even passable entertainment. Hitchcock may -- or may not -- be revealing his psyche more in this film than in any other he ever made, which makes it Jim-dandy for discussion of his entire career, but that doesn't mean VERTIGO stands up on its own.Rather than representing the epitome of what the name Hitchcock stands for, VERTIGO should represent some sort of embarrassment. The story is poorly plotted and poorly told. Novak and Barabra Bel Geddes give solid performances, but Stewart is just terrible in the central role; it just may be is worst screen performance. And Hitchcock's stylistic touches seem self-consciously obvious, detracting form the drama rather than underscoring it. But, as a dress rehearsal for what he would soon accomplish, VERTIGO works decently enough. The red herring first act, the unexpected death of the leading lady, the psychologically scarred protagonist with necrophilic leanings (played by an actor with an established boy-next-door image), the denial of a one woman's death by creating the illusion she exists in another person's body; these are all elements that would rise again in PSYCHO, Hitchcock's true masterpiece. PSYCHO realizes the vision that VERTIGO only promises.",Vertigo

215,pfgpowell-1,"Best film of all time (as of yesterday)? Er, not quite, more Hitchcock once again doing his schtick (which is OK, but this is no masterpiece)",5,2 August 2012,"It's Thursday, August 2, 2012, and as of yesterday until it, too, is knocked off its perch, Hitchcock's Vertigo has been declared by the saintly cineastes around the world to whose apparently impeccable taste and judgment we are bound to bow as 'the greatest movie of all time'. Well, all I can say, is 'up to a point, Lord Copper'. The film it dislodged was Orson Welles' Citizen Kane, another 'masterpiece' which was also entertaining enough but . . . But then who am I do disagree, especially as others here use such superlatives as 'masterpiece', 'excellent' and 'perfect'?However, disagree I do, with those verdicts and the judgment of that pantheon of cinema's saints about Vertigo and Citizen Kane. It's pertinent that I find the kind of 'rich list' mentality which always wants a top of the pops a tad tacky and infantile, but that in itself would be no reason to criticise Vertigo. One bod pontificating on the radio yesterday (Nick James, the editor of Sight & Sound it was) admitted that on its release Vertigo was not especially popular with the critics who found the plot not just overwrought but downright ludicrous. But, he added, it has found greater recognition and popularity 54 years on because 'it has more to do with our inner lives (than Citizen Kane) and we're more interested in our inner lives than we have been for a while'. Give me a break.For this viewer Vertigo is entertaining enough but has dated badly. It is shot through with the kind of cod psychology which was so popular with Fifties folk, and its style is still very rooted in the kind of melodrama which defined cinema when a young Alfred Hitchcock was learning his trade in the Twenties and early Thirties. And, yes, the plot is still ludicrous. That, of course, need not be a bad thing, but a director attempting something similar today would surely attempt a far more nuanced approach and use a scalpel to pare away at his or her material rather than the hammer and chisel Hitchcock employs.In fact, were a director able to pull it off today, he would ensure that at first, second and third blush we would not even realise quite how ludicrous the plot is. Here's an example of quite how much Vertigo is not a masterpiece: Barbara Bel Geddes plays a character, a friend of Stewart's, who is in love with him, but is only in the film 1) to set the hare rolling by giving us Stewart's story in one of the opening scenes 2) acting as a red herring. She appears twice more, once in a very odd scene in which she tries - in a quite bizarre way - to show him she loves him, and then when Stewart is in the looney bin for six months after having a nightmare.Most crucially, in that opening scene there are not one but two shots, both close-ups of Bel Geddes face, which apparently convey that: take note, there're more to this character than meets the eye. In fact, both shots and their spurious significance are irrelevant. After the character has appeared several times to serve Hitchock's purpose - well, forget the Barbara Bel Geddes character: Hitchcock has no more use for her and we never see her again. Masterpiece? Cineastes - I would prefer to put the word in inverted commas as in 'cineastes' - who often like to lord it over us given their superior knowledge of 'film history' and like nothing better than to have a valhalla of director heroes might well argue that 'introducing' the Barbara Bel Geddes character helps 'build up the suspense' and is Hitchcock 'at his most masterful'. Not really - sloppy scriptwriting would be more to the point.So there you have it. I'm giving this a 5 out of 10 because it does the biz in Hitchcock's own way, but treat it and its special effects more as an historical artefact than 'the greatest movie of all time'. For a far better Hitchcock film, track down Lifeboat (with a screenplay by John Steinbeck).Oh, and I've always fancied Kim Novak, and still do. That earned this film one more point than I thought it deserved.",Vertigo
216,TaylorYee94,"Overrated, critics' favorite, good example to study the films not to appreciate them",6,25 September 2020,"Interesting story, but it feels elongated. I like how the director plays well with psychology. Mystery and rumors centered on Carlotta Valdes, ghost possessing over Madeleine, and a new woman looking like her. However, unlike 'Psycho', 'Vertigo' does not keep me on my toes because some narratives are unnecessarily stretched such as chasing Madeleine, Judy's scene in her room after she met Scottie again, and Scottie waiting for Judy to dress like Madeleine.Contemporaneous reviews also point out these drawbacks with the words ""too long"" or ""bogs down in a maze of detail"". However, this film is a good example to 'study' the techniques used in the movie directing. Dolly zoom, visual effects (Scottie's nightmare), use of colors were very creative at that point of time. (However, that psychedelic lightings and flowers turning to papers look ridiculous in 2020.) Did those tools contribute to deliver a story or a message clearly or to arouse the feelings and emotions? NO! What is the use of all the fancy techniques when it cannot fulfill the purpose of theatre? 'Vertigo' is a great educational material to study films but not a great work of art.",Vertigo

219,emperor_bender,They don't make em like they used to,10,9 June 2008,"Movies these days are all exactly the same. They are either stupid, lame comedies, boring, overly dramatic, ridiculous chick flicks, or AWFUL horrors.But back in the day (not my day, I'm only 19), there were interesting movies. One of them is Alfred Hitchcock's Vertigo.Vertigo is a word that is overly used nowadays without much meaning behind it. But it is referring to the illness suffered by the protagonist, John Ferguson (James Stewart), or Scottie as he's most often referred to as. Scottie contracted this after seeing a fellow police officer fall to his death from a rooftop when he was a cop and chasing a criminal on the rooftops. This comes into play a few times throughout the film.An old college friend of Scottie's, Gavin Elster (Tom Helmore) calls Scottie up one day, asking him to come out of retirement. Seems Gavin is bent on the thought that his wife, Madeleine (Kim Novak) is possessed by a ghost and is wandering around in a trans. He is worried she will get herself killed. Scottie sets off on his duty to watch over Madeleine and keep her safe, while trying to patch things up with his former love, Midge (Barbara Bel Geddes).Alfred Hitchcock can make a wide variety of great movies that redefine each genre they are placed in. Vertigo may be very different than Hitchcock's famous Psycho, but it should not be given any less respect. Elements of Hitchcock's famous directing are evident here.The plot is very well written and each scene is well-executed. The style of some more intense scenes is one that is rarely ever scene on film nowadays.Vertigo is a movie that can not be matched by any ridiculous remake or knock-off. Hopefully they will have the good taste to keep this movie one of its own.",Vertigo
220,diac228,Great mystery. Irritating conclusion. Wait its still going...,7,20 July 2010,"Usually, I don't comment much on older movies, as people are less likely to read what it is I have to say. But, this is an exception as an unemployed bitter critic goes up against a film considered amongst the best of all-time. What was a slightly panned movie at first, Vertigo eventually established itself as one of the top masterpiece films from Hitchcock and one of the greatest movies ever. Here is where the praise ends. Vertigo is two parts excellent, and one part draggy. What started out as a spellbinding mystery with few clues as to where it's going, transported into a frustrating psychological thriller that took way too long to conclude. Alfred Hitchcock is a master director, but the script revealed all its trick cards much too soon, leaving us with nothing more than an ace of spades in the third act.Vertigo is a film that works in two layers: there are two conflicts presented. The first two acts involve the main conflict, the main mystery, and the final act involves the consequences and results of the original mystery. John Ferguson (James Stewart) develops a fear of heights after a terrible accident while chasing a suspect on the rooftops. After the accident, he agrees to snoop after the wife (Kim Novak) of an old college friend in order to occupy his time after retiring from the police force. What follows is a twisted path full of deceits, lies, murder, and surprises. And this is just two-thirds of the movie. Based off of a French novel ""The Living and the Dead,"" Vertigo's spellbinding screenplay is written by Samuel A. Taylor.The intrigue of this film is the sheer confusing mystery and descriptive imagery that offered light clues. It wasn't the typical mystery, as you didn't quite know who to trust and who to believe. James Stewart does a fantastic job portraying the bored ex-detective constantly trying to overcome his devastating fear. The lead female, Kim Novak, also does a great job, despite being twice as young as the male lead. Besides them, there aren't a lot of major roles, but all the supporting cast did a respectable job.With mysteries of this magnitude, you need a master of suspense to keep the audience riveted. Alfred Hitchcock is one of the best directors of all-time, and is the main reason why Vertigo stays afloat. He times his shots perfectly; he always starts the films off with a bang, and does a great job maintaining the suspense, even long after the main flaw of the flick is revealed. My favorite trait of Hitchcock is how he paces the story well and never over-does the shots---unlike your Stanley Kubrick and his followers. His only minor flaw is his rushing towards the endings, which includes this one. Nonetheless, he expands his horizons a bit by delivering some nice animated sequences and delightful visual clues.The griping begins here. The acting, writing, directing, music, and pacing works perfectly fine---until the third act. Mysteries run like a magical act, you should never ever reveal the secret until after the trick is performed, that is if you choose to. In the case of Vertigo however, the twist is revealed to the audience in between the second and third act, still leaving a hefty dose of story to tell. The main appeal of Vertigo is gone: the intrigue, the mystery has disappeared. The problem has been solved to a major extent, but we still are not seeing the credits. Not sure where the blame should be placed, but I'll hand it to the writer, which spilled the beans far too soon.Films can run on multiple genres sometimes (District 9 being a recent successful example), but when the first part is mystery, it's a lot tougher to pull off a wholesome successful film. I found myself on the edge during the first hour and a half, but utterly distraught in the final half hour. The funny thing is the only thing that had to change was the trump card revelation. If they had moved the revelation just twenty minutes further, it would have helped Vertigo a whole lot. But, the early reviews were correct, the last third of the flick bogged down the overall movie.Bottom Line: Alfred Hitchcock does his best to salvage a script that turned off the smokescreen far too soon. His directing remains inches below perfection, as he directs a great acting cast, grand musical score, and clever mystery. But, once the mystery is gone, so is the quality and interest. Vertigo is a good film, but in my eyes misses the mark slightly because of the editing/writing issue I have discussed throughout this review. Despite what your usual film major and film critics say, this isn't among Hitchcock's best, and this isn't one of the best films of all-time. There are superior mysteries and surprise twists past and present. Just imagine what would have happened if the surprises of The Usual Suspects, Fight Club, and The Sixth Sense had been revealed sooner? Those movies would have been extremely different in terms of theming, pacing and quality.",Vertigo
221,avik-basu1889,"In my eyes, Hitchcock's ultimate masterpiece !!!",10,14 April 2016,"First of all, while reviewing this film I have to say that 'Vertigo' requires multiple viewings. When I watched it for the first time, I liked it, but it didn't blow me away. But on subsequent viewings, not only has it amazed me with the implicit richness, it is now my favourite Hitchcock film, which is saying a lot as I adore films like 'Rear Window', 'Psycho', 'The Birds',etc. The screenplay written by Samuel A. Taylor, Alec Coppel and Maxwell Anderson in close collaboration with Hitchcock is based on the French crime novel 'The Living and the Dead' is brilliant and takes the film to the brink of greatness, but what pushes it over the edge and takes it into the masterpiece territory is Hitchcock's direction. Hitchcock's approach to filmmaking had a lot to do with what he called 'Pure Cinema' which involved using masterful technique and direction to put the viewer in the shoes of the protagonist and put them in the moment and make them feel the tension and the suspense. The explicit generally was more prominent than the implicit themes and subtexts. But Vertigo is different because there are endless things happening underneath and it is unbelievably layered and nuanced and deep because of Hitchcock's direction if the viewer is looking for the themes and from experience I think multiple viewings is required for that.A connection between 'Vertigo' and 'Rear Window' can be based in Hitchcock's fascination with the human tendency of voyeurism. The first part of the film involves Scottie following Madeleine obsessively which is very similar to Jeff's obsession with the goings-on in the apartment in front of his window in 'Rear Window'. A connection between 'Vertigo' and 'Psycho' can be drawn but it's far more tangential and less direct. The second half of 'Vertigo' becomes a full blown character study which has extremely disturbing subtexts which is also the case in 'Psycho' as it also has very disturbing subtexts, however 'Vertigo' in my eyes has more depth and layers.Possible interpretations of the film:Firstly it can be seen as a damning indictment of some men's obsession with their idea of female beauty and fantasies and their tendency to force their fantasies on their partners. Secondly it can be seen as an indirect indictment of the obsession of Hollywood studios with casting beautiful women. In a snide way Hitchcock might be taking the mickey out of his own self as he himself was well known for casting a lot of attractive blonde women in the majority of his films.Thirdly this can be seen as a film which makes references to the Greek myth of 'Orpheus and Eurydice'. Scottie clearly falls madly in love with Madeleine which gradually becomes an obsession. This obsession gets the better of him. When he meets Judy, his obsession with Madeleine overwhelms his thoughts and his unending attempts to relive the sensation of being with Madeleine through Julie ultimately makes him lose 'Madeleine' again which is very similar to the story of Orpheus. Hitchcock himself has talked about the disturbing elements of necrophilia that 'Vertigo' contains. This film also is a statement on the power of fiction be it in any form like books, cinema, etc. There is a particular scene towards the beginning of the film where Gavin Elster has the conversation with Scottie which makes Scottie interested in pursuing the case. The blocking in the scene is interesting. There is a particular moment where Elster is standing on what looks like an elevated stage while clearly lying and Scottie is watching him while sitting on a chair just like an audience member.'Vertigo' can also be seen as a work on masculinity and male insecurity. I have heard reviews where the bell tower has been described as a phallic symbol. When Scottie fails to 'save' Madeleine due to his vertigo, he succumbs to feelings of despair and uselessness. He views his inability to save her due to his vertigo as a blot on his manhood. But when he figures out that he has been tricked, his rage come to the surface. He forcibly takes Judy back to the bell tower in an attempt to overcome his fear of heights and in a thematic sense 'regain' his manhood.All the themes of the script work because Hitchcock through his masterful direction allows them to work. The way Hitchcock uses colour motifs in the film is breathtaking. He uses the colour red to signify Scottie's obsession. He uses green to signify something ghostly or ethereal which is why Madeleine/Judy is seen wearing green dresses. There are two beautiful profile shots of Kim Novak once as Madeleine and the other as Judy. They beautifully juxtapose each other. The first one shows Madeleine's profile shot with the blazing red colour all around it to signify the arousal of Scottie's obsession. The second one is in Judy's apartment where we see Judy's side face which is engulfed in darkness with the neon green light all around her face showing how Judy is invisible to Scottie. All he sees is the green light which reminds him of the ghostly Madeleine. The uninterrupted 360 degree kissing shot where Scottie in his mind actually recreates the past climaxing in the still of Scottie and Judy kissing in front of the green light resulting in a rebirth of the spirit of Madeleine in Scottie's head is one of the greatest shots in film history and an example of Hitchcock's masterful vision.James Stewart plays an uncharacteristic role as Scottie. Scottie is nowhere near the lovable and kind character that he was generally known for playing. Kim Novak is absolutely brilliant playing the two roles of Madeleine and Judy. She brings in subtlety and perfectly manages to make both the characters distinct.'Vertigo's thematic depth, rich use of colour and Hitchcock's masterful storytelling make it a masterpiece.",Vertigo
222,dead47548,Superb!,10,9 January 2008,"Let me start by saying that the twist is one of the most original, shocking and simply intelligent that I've ever seen on film. I was completely stunned when it was revealed, and I can only think of one or two other occasions of me being shocked remotely by a twist. Hitchcock has a rare ability to have the film run 15 full minutes with no dialogue, yet it remains just as/if not more engaging as any action filled bloodfest we see today. My eyes became completely glued to the screen as I became just as obsessed with discovering the truth behind the mystery as Scottie was. As Lynch does in Blue Velvet, Hitchcock uses the theme of voyeurism throughout yet instead of making it perverse and disgusting he somehow makes the act feel completely natural and almost comfortable; it's just like a second nature.The use of contra-zoom to display the sense of vertigo is absolutely astonishing. It perfectly depicts the sensation and even gives the viewer a sense of the illness whenever the technique is used. The performances are fantastic. Stewart is definitely at the top of his game, bringing us right into the character in what I consider the finest work of his career. Novak is even more incredible, delivering one of my all time favorite portrayals. She is completely immersed into her character and furthers the viewer's immersion into Scottie. We really feel the same emotions as he does throughout the entire picture. The ending is unbelievably abrupt, but that makes it all the more shocking and utterly cathartic.",Vertigo

It's classic Hitchcock direction, of course, but the plot tries to cover too many stories and it just becomes tiresome after a while. First there's the mystery surrounding Madeleine's 'possession', then the love story between her and Scotty, then the mystery surrounding her death, and then the love story between Scotty and Judy, and then - finally - the completion of the mystery. Too much flip-flopping between the various mysteries and love stories. I also thought that Scotty's vertigo should have been more incorporated into the film - it shows up once at the beginning, once in the middle, once at the end, and that's it. Still, Stewart is great and Novak is gorgeous and fantastic in her dualish role, and it's fantastically directed, of course. I would have loved it if it had followed the promise shown in the opening scene, but alas, only the trippy dream sequence and the stuff in the bell tower does so.

There are so many good characters in this movie - but I almost think my favorite character is the city of San Francisco. Not really, it's Jimmy Stewart. BUT San Fran sure figures prominently in the movie. What a gorgeous city. Perhaps I'm a little partial because my husband & I spent our honeymoon there 20 years ago. The cinematography alone is worth seeing this movie as it is filmed beautifully. Also, there is some artistic twists like the green lights and haze in Novaks apartment.This movie is definitely a great plot twister the 1st time you see it. It of course loses some of the bang with subsequent viewings since you know the twist. However, subsequent viewings are still enjoyable as I always notice different tidbits and details I didn't catch before.I love Jimmy Stewart in his love-sick puppy, obsession role. I love the title theme music. It starts creating tension right off the bat, and keeps your pulse going throughout the movie, anticipating what is going to happen next.I just recently re-watched the movie (probably my 5-6th time) with my 14 year old daughter, who was seeing it for the first time. I had yet been able to convince her to watch any old, classic movies with me ( too old fashioned in her mind). But for whatever reason, she agreed this time. And what a great 1st classic movie for her to see. I was surprised but she not only stuck with it all the way to the end, but was actually somewhat riveted throughout the movie! What surprised me is she somewhat predicted the ending ahead of time. That kind of shocked me because I never saw it coming the first time I watched.I'm not sure why, but Midge's character creeps me out more with each viewing. Especially the painting scene - she seems like a stalker, obsessed lover. But Bel Geddes plays her beautifully.You definitely have to see this movie. It is one of Hitchcock's best!",Vertigo
228,tastyhotdogs,It's everything I wish I didn't know,6,18 August 2007,"At the Big W DVD Sale, they had a great 5 movie Hitchcock pack going for $25 cash money. One of the films in it is ""Vertigo"".""Vertigo"" is ranked 35 on the IMDb.com top 250, meaning it must have some cred (then again The Simpsons Movie and Casino Royale are in it too, so....). It tells the story of a cop, John Fergurson (James Stewart), who discovers while chasing a bandit that he has vertigo. This causes him to have to quit the force. It's not long before an old friend offers him the chance to do some private detective work, albeit a bit strange as he wants him to track his wife who's doing some weird stuff. Fegurson soon becomes obsessed and forms a relationship with her after saving her from a suicide attempt (or was it???). The relationship grows (I won't go into too much detail as it would really spoil it for anyone planning on seeing it) and comes to a head when Fergurson is forced to face his fears.Some great scenes, with some groundbreaking directing, and an outstanding performance by Stewart. Problem for me was that the story was just a bit weird. The obsessive story was downright creepy at times, especially in the later stages of the movie, but I just thought it could have been more solid. I'm aware it is over 40 years old and obviously was ahead of it's time, but I can't allow for that. I grew up in an era of Hollywood where Robert deNiro put people's head in vices and Joe Pesci stabbed people with pens. Now that's creepy. Having said that, this movie remade in modern times could be potentially awesome (think about ""Fear"" done a million times better with first class actors).

She is also very fond of Scottie, in fact I believe they were close to being married at one time. Mitch designs undergarments as well as paints. One day Scottie is over at Mitch's just talking. Scottie tells her about his Acrophobia and he tries some exercises to see if he can reduce it some or get rid of it. When Scottie gets ready to leave Mitch explains that the only way it can be cured is by a sudden event. Scottie goes to see about a job through a Galvin Elstreem( Tom Helmore). Galvin wants to hire him to follow his wife Madeline ( Kim Novak). Galvin believes a long dead relative, a Carlotta Valdize has taken possession of her. When this happens she is no longer Madeline, she becomes Carlotta. When this happens she goes into a trance, and becomes Carlotta. Galvin also claims his wife becomes suicidal, under these episodes. At first, Scottie passes on the job, but then decides to accept the case.The next day, Scottie follows Madeline from a mission cemetery to an art gallery. Here she sets a stare at her beautiful relative in a portrait; The Portrait of Carlotta. Scottie follows her from the hotel she is staying to various other places around San Francisco watching her, her behavior, E.T.C.. She goes to a swank flower shop and purchases a bouquet of pink roses. Then she drives to San Francisco Bay. Scottie notices how she slowly moves to the bottom, then starts throwing in the roses. All of a sudden she jumps into the bay, when he sees this he jumps in to save her. That night he takes her back to his apartment where she is resting comfortably. When she wakes up she is started, and wonders where she is. He tells her what happened, but she has no memory of what happened. He asks her a few more questions, before he calls Galvin back. When he calls Galvin she flies the coup. As the movie progresses he develops a relationship with her. One night Mitch drives up; and sees Madeline come out of his apartment. She is upset and leaves, latter she paints a portrait of her as Carlotta to get even. It's cruel, and it costs her a movie date with her friend.Scottie continue's the case, and Madeline tells him about the dream she keeps having. A Spanish mission that she believes is a calling from Carlotta. Scottie describes the place and tells her it's the San Juan Batista. It's 90 miles south of San Francisco. He calms her down and tells her they will travel there tomorrow.
They travel there, and everything she described is there. When they get close to the Spanish mission tower, Madeline has a request. She wants to go up to the tower alone. When she quickly runs into the tower, Scottie goes after her. He only gets so far up to the tower his Acrophobia strikes. All of a sudden we see Madeline fall from the top and killing herself. After this happens an inquest is done; but no crime is committed.One night Scottie has a nightmare where he sees Madeline fail over and over, and he is unable to help her. This dream was so severe that it causes him to have a breakdown. This sends him to a Psychiatric hospital, where he is completely detached . The one who has been by his side the whole time is Mitch. Mitch talks to the doctor about his prognosis. The doctor explains he could be there for 6 mths. to a year.A year passes and Scottie has been release. He she's a car that used to belong to Madeline and asks the lady where she got it. She explain a Galvin Elster sold it to her. He is obsessed He notices a woman Judy Barton who looks like Madeline except for the hair. He follows her to her room at a hotel, asks her a few questions. They start a relationship where he molds her to look exactly like Madeleine; the same hair, clothes, everything. She doesn't like it, but goes along with it to keep him happy. The relationship grows, and one night he finds out who she really is because of the old fashioned neckless. He is upset, so he decides before dinner to teach her a lesson.He travels back to San Juan Batista where it all happened. This is when Judy/Madeline knows he found out who she is. When they reach the top of the bell tower, she explains what happened. She is an actress hired by Gavin to pose as his wife; because she looked so much like her. He was planning on killing his wife, and needed the perfect double. Galvin new if he hired you to follow me he could pull it off, because of the Vertigo. Gavin got away with murder and Judy was given money and the neckless, which gave her I.D. away at the end. When they were both arguing a nun comes up to the tower because of the commotion. It startles Judy that she loses her balance and falls to her death.In conclusion, this is one of Hitchcock's best movies. It shows the darker side of married life; and the length they will go to get rid of their spouse. Sometime I wonder why not just get a divorce, but some people will always choose the quicker path. I recommend this hit to everyone, and if marriage dosen't work the second time, give up. Remember there is no such this as the perfect crime.",Vertigo

Now, there are only two possiblities -either she is poccesed or she is pretending to be. That's why I said there's not much of a suspence. Most of the suspence comes through music only. With almost forty minutes of running time left, whole story is revealed .Now Hitchcock is a smart director, he did not try it make look smart by putting another twist but immediately changed the story from there.

234,Danny_G13,Very well constructed indeed,9,7 November 2004,"The legend that is Alfred Hitchcock needs absolutely no introduction, so I won't waste time with rhetoric. Vertigo is a psychological mystery starring the fantastic James Stewart as John 'Scottie' Ferguson, a retired detective who is approached by an old school/college friend, Gavin Elster, and requested to follow the gentleman's wife, in the vein of a private detective. The reason for the pursuit is the friend's wife Madeleine is acting bizarrely, and Elster believes she is literally possessed by a ghost. She seems to have conscious blackouts and doesn't remember things which have happened to her.Scottie reluctantly gets involved and follows her, studying her intriguing behaviour and trying to figure out what on earth is happening to her, without making contact. However, after a dramatic event at the Golden Gate Bridge, the 2 'meet' and Scottie finds himself getting involved to an unprofessional level...James Stewart, as expected, is spell binding. He truly is the most popular star of all time and with performances like this it was not hard to see why. He brings an everyman personability to every role, and is never less than utterly likable. His down to earth charm is always as gripping as it is believable.Kim Novak, as the troubled Madeleine, is also absolutely excellent in a type of Sugar Cane but-more-serious-type of role as the perfect woman who seems unobtainable. Her slightly austere personality fits the story perfectly.The last major player next to Elster is Midge Wood, a type of live in 'friend' who stays with Scottie. She is also completely besotted with him but it doesn't seem entirely mutual. Balanced but infatuated, her existence is a slightly tortured one.The direction is the 4th major character here, and I say that deliberately. It is quite outstanding, with some truly rich colouring, top class cinematography, and impressive special effects. The world of Vertigo is brought to life by a true master of cinema in Hitchcock.It might not have the claustrophobia or wit of Rear Window, or the horror of Psycho, but it's clearly intended as a movie entirely on its own merits.A great tale and utterly timeless.",Vertigo
235,dr_clarke_2,Alfred Hitchcock's greatest film?,10,25 June 2020,"Is Vertigo Alfred Hitchcock's greatest film? It's often described as such, and indeed in 2012 was voted best film ever made by the BFI's Sight & Sound critics poll, knocking Citizen Kane off the top spot for the first time ever. Any film so heavily hyped has difficult expectations to live up to, but certainly Vertigo is a remarkable slice of cinema.
The story sees retired policeman ""Scottie"" Ferguson hired by his old friend Gavin Elster to follow and investigate Elster's wife Madeleine, who Gavin claims is behaving oddly. Adapted from the novel D'entre les morts by Pierre Boileau and Thomas Narcejac, the screenplay written by Alec Coppel and Samuel Taylor is riddled with misdirection and has an often sinister air, with suggestions that Madeleine is possessed by the spirit of a dead woman who committed suicide. Scenes such as Konstantin Shayne's Pop Leibel telling the story of Carlotta Valdes' suicide significantly add to this feeling. The story changes direction halfway through when Madeleine commits suicide by jumping from a church tower, after which Scottie - who had fallen in love with her - encounters Judy Barlow, a woman who looks exactly like Madeleine.
The explanation for why Madeleine and Judy are doppelgangers and what is really going on is enormously satisfying, as the shocking, tragic denouement. But as intriguing as the story of Vertigo is, it is only part of a greater whole. It succeeds on many different levels, not least of which is James Stewart's performance as Scottie: cast against type, Stewart plays the increasingly obsessive, disturbed character with twitchy intensity and his treatment of Judy in the second half of the film is profoundly creepy. Hitchcock deliberately chose to reveal the truth about Judy to the audience two thirds of the way through the film, which allows the audience to understand why Judy would put up with a man who tries to control every aspect of her appearance and behaviour. Kim Novak is as impressive as Stewart, especially since as Madeleine Novak is playing a woman who is acting and gives a remarkably convincing performance as a woman supposedly questioning her sanity.
The look of the film is also a key factor in its enduring legacy. Hitchcock expertly controls every aspect of the film, as demonstrated by the spiral symbolism: the recurring spirals of the opening titles set the tone for a plot that spirals back on itself, with Scottie pressuring Judy into dressing as Madeleine, and ultimately forcing her to revisit the scene of her apparent suicide, resulting in Judy's actual death. Bernard Hermann's score complements this theme perfectly, creating a swirling vortex of sound. Following Madeleine's ""death"" there's an almost psychedelic sequence in which Scottie is haunted by what has happened, and with a mix of different coloured filters and even animation, it's like nothing seen previously in any of Hitchcock's films. Regular Hitchcock cinematographer Robert Burks adds to the film's unsettling atmosphere with the famous dolly zoom first used in the opening scenes of Scottie dangling from a rooftop, which visually represents the acrophobia and vertigo that haunt him throughout the film. The lengthy scenes of Scottie following Madeleine, which are largely dependent on physical and facial acting from Stewart and Novak, are given a highly distinctive atmosphere by the combination of the score and the camerawork.
Quantifying any film as the best ever made is always problematic, since it is ultimately a matter of opinion. But Vertigo is certainly one of those movies in which every single aspect works well both individually and with every other part to make a captivating cinematic experience. If nothing else, it serves as an object lesson in why Alfred Hitchcock remains one of the film industry's most revered directors.",Vertigo

239,zeekwunlau,Fate,8,26 April 2020,"Hitchcock completely subverted the narrative core of the two parts of the film, and the protagonist also changed from a woman who fled with money to a man who killed the woman. In this film, the eyes of the first half of the audience followed the male lead Ferguson to witness the strange behavior and traces of the female host Mullen after being ""possessed"". And as Mullen jumped down on the top of the tower, was judged to commit suicide, Mullen 's husband got the legacy, Ferguson who fell in love with Mullen was desperate, and as a witness confirmed that Mullen committed suicide by jumping off the building, everything seemed to follow The development of traditional film noir. Ferguson should find himself being used by his former classmates, using his fear of heights to help his classmates complete evil plans, and then he will have to work hard to find evidence and truth and bring the former classmates to justice. But Hitchcock did not use this hand-to-catch routine, but instead changed the audience's perspective from the male host to the female host, as he did in ""The Horror,"" and the replacement bridge was love. So in the second half came a story of love tragedy (destiny) dedicated to love.It was Mullen who died in the jump, but she was already dead. Her body was thrown away by Judy, who pretended to be Mullen, and Ferguson, an old classmate who had been waiting on the roof of the building. The fearful Ferguson had already turned the truth away, so he took the illusion as the truth and blamed himself. Judy pretends to be Mullen to implement the plan only to get some money and a necklace, but the plan cannot keep up with the changes. When she fell in love with Ferguson, she was destined to never change back to herself. She dressed herself as Mullen at the request of Ferguson. She loved Ferguson, but Ferguson loved Mullen. Judy had to wear a mask to get along with the beloved Ferguson and had to live in the shadow of a dead woman. The movie at this time has completely entered the love story. Until the necklace worn by Judy exposed the feet of the horse, Ferguson took Judy up the clock tower again, and dismantled the conspiracy. Eventually, Judy was frightened by the sudden appearance of a nun who appeared on the side and fell to the building. Lun formed a fatal agreement, and Ferguson looked at Judy's body from the clock tower, as if he had cured his fear of heights. At this point, a series of elements that should have been the biggest suspense have been eliminated as to whether Ferguson 's old classmates have been punished by law, how Mullen was killed by her husband, and so on. Hitchcock turned the suspense movie into a love movie by changing the role perspective and narrative core, and used love to punish Judy and cure Ferguson.",Vertigo
240,x_manicure_x,Masterful film with a soap opera plot,8,14 August 2021,"Despite what critics say, ""Vertigo"" might not be the best film of all time, but it's an impressive work indeed. A fascinating mystery that masterfully portrays a woman's inner conflict and a psychopath's pathetic obsession for something that is not real (his attempt at ""resurrecting"" Madeleine by humiliating Judy as a woman, his lifetime search for a love that is not ordinary despite having someone who truly cares always beside him).I loved how the meticulous camerawork goes along with the structure of the film, with wide angles that follow Scottie's eyes through the investigation, warmer closeups after he finds love, and again wide but this time disorienting cuts in the third part as the mystery unfolds and Scottie loses his mind.The theme of the ""spiral"" associated with the feeling of vertigo is recurrent both visually and narratively. Technicolor is used as an expressive means, with vivid and vibrant colors standing for Scottie's passion and fantasies, and dark, pale palettes once he faces reality in the ending. Judy is often associated with different shades green, bright for her dress as Madeleine, dim when she connects with Carlotta at the cemetery and at the museum. During her iconic metamorphosis scene in the hotel room, the green neon lights paint the whole room in an eerie, unnatural tint that creates an uncanny atmosphere and points out Scottie's twisted desire to connect to an otherworldly dimension.The special effects and painted sceneries surely show their limits, but also found tasteful uses in the memorable nightmare sequence.The script and acting are not always up to par, at times leaning towards soap-opera level melodrama, but we should not forget that they reflect the taste of a sixty-year-old Hollywood.",Vertigo
241,mlraymond,"A detective hired to watch over a suicidal woman falls in love with her and gets involved in an eerie, baffling mystery.",10,15 October 2006,"Many viewers consider this film to be Hitchcock's masterpiece. I agree, due to a number of factors. The hypnotic, lush score by Bernard Herrman combines with the superb set design and cinematography to create an unforgettable atmosphere of strangeness and uncanny beauty. The performances are all excellent, with Kim Novak's dual role convincingly creating two completely different characters. The most outstanding,and at the same time most problematic aspect of the story is the character of Scottie. James Stewart is so convincing as the obsessed hero that he actually becomes uncomfortable to watch. His likable, easy-going character at the beginning has become a driven, compulsive,perhaps even seriously disturbed man by the end. He has suffered a mental breakdown and is terribly vulnerable, but our initial sympathy,though still felt for this flawed hero, has become strained and awkward. Stewart's performance is a triumph of screen acting, yet so powerful as to risk overwhelming the audience with conflicting feelings. Any actor who can create such a genuinely disturbing and yet basically appealing character deserves high praise indeed.",Vertigo
242,disinterested_spectator,Dreams within a Dream,10,21 December 2014,"Unless a movie is a fantasy, like ""The Wizard of Oz"" (1939), people tend to feel cheated if they find out that most of a movie has just been a dream. To keep the audience from feeling cheated, then, some movies will be ambiguous as to whether what we are seeing is reality or a dream, and this is the case with ""Vertigo."" The movie begins with a close-up of a woman's face. The camera moves in even closer on her eye, in which we begin to see swirling animation along with the opening credits. Moving into her eye suggests that we have moved into her subjective state, allowing us to see what she is imagining or remembering. And the animation is a further indication that what we are seeing is not real. Is the entire movie that follows this woman's dream?After the credits, the movie jumps right into a chase sequence on the rooftops of tall buildings, when police detective John ""Scottie"" Ferguson slips and finds himself hanging from the gutter above the city street below, which causes him to have vertigo. A uniformed policeman tries to pull him to safety, but slips and falls to his death. When the scene ends, Ferguson is still hanging there, and we do not see him being rescued nor is there any reference to his being rescued afterward, leading some critics to argue that the rest of the movie is his hallucinatory dream while he remains suspended.In the next scene, we meet Midge. In her conversation with Ferguson, whom she calls Johnny or Johnny O, we find out that they were engaged for three weeks while they were in college, but that she broke off the engagement, even though she says that she never married because he is the only man for her. From the surreptitious glances she gives him as they talk, we suspect there is more to the story than Ferguson is aware of. Midge is played by Barbara Bel Geddes, a nice looking woman with no sex appeal. We can easily believe that she broke off the engagement when she realized that he had no passion for her, so their relationship is Platonic. Such relationships are often characterized by saying that the man and woman are like brother and sister, but several remarks suggest that she is more like a mother to him. This implies that there is something naïve and inexperienced about Ferguson, as when they talk about braziers, and she says, ""You know about those things. You're a big boy now.""Ferguson is an old bachelor. Today, a man who has been a lifelong bachelor would be assumed to have had sexual relationships along the way. But in 1958, when this movie was made, it was not uncommon for bachelors to be virgins, and that is probably the case with Ferguson. This makes it understandable when he later becomes obsessed with Madeleine, a woman he has been hired to follow by her husband, who is worried about her mental state. His latent sexuality suddenly bursts forth, for which he is completely unprepared.Madeleine appears to be possessed by the spirit of her great grandmother, Carlotta Valdes, causing her to have strange dreams, to enter dreamlike trances, threatening to cause her to die like Carlotta, who committed suicide. When Madeleine does indeed apparently leap to her death, Ferguson feels responsible, and he ends up having nightmares, in which he sees himself falling the way Madeleine did. As a result, he ends up in a mental institution, in catatonic state.Supposedly, he gets out of the mental institution, discovers a woman named Judy, who looks like Madeleine, and begins trying to make the resemblance even greater by getting her to dye her hair and wear it like Madeleine, to dress like Madeleine, until he eventually discovers she really is Madeleine. Or rather that Madeleine was murdered by her husband, and that Judy helped him do it by pretending to be Madeleine. This leads to a climactic scene in which Judy accidentally falls to her death.Though the movie can be understood realistically in this way, there is a good reason to suspect that the second half is just a dream. In any movie you have ever seen in which someone is in a hospital, there is always a getting-out-of-the hospital scene, as in ""The Glass Key"" (1942), ""Kiss Me Deadly"" (1955), and ""The Godfather"" (1972). But there is no such scene in this movie. And considering that we last saw Ferguson in a psychotic state, the need for a getting-out-of-the-hospital scene would be even greater than in the examples just given, where only physical conditions were involved. Instead, we suddenly see Ferguson outside the building where Madeleine once lived, and the fact that he had once been under the care of psychiatrists is never even referred to during the rest of the movie.By regarding the second half of the movie as a dream, the movie as a whole becomes more realistic. The murder plot is far-fetched and would have been extremely difficult to arrange. There are easier ways for a man to get rid of his wife than that. The idea that Madeleine was mentally unbalanced, had found out about her great-grandmother and become obsessed with her story, leading her to commit suicide, is much easier to believe.Furthermore, Midge is not seen in the second half. She represents rationality and common sense, as well as being the woman Ferguson should have married. Her absence in the second half is an indication that only irrational forces are at work in his dream. The dream is wish-fulfilling. By dreaming that the woman he loved really did not die, that she was involved in a murder plot to kill the real Madeleine, he absolves himself in his dream of any responsibility for what happened to her, and is cured of his vertigo too.",Vertigo
243,jldmp1,Cantilevered,7,19 April 2006,"To cut to the chase, this is not Hitchcock's best whole work, but the components are noteworthy.The ""Vertigo"" hinges on the 'pull back/focus in' gag, repeated enough times to have a comic effect. Other than that, the camera has little to say...it has far less curiosity than ""Psycho""'s camera, for instance.It does have some clever self-reference...Helmore is the 'director' who knows how to use 'actors'. The narrative turns when our surrogate 'writer' cum detective, Stewart, tries to direct the vision, by reconstructing Novak from 'Judy', back to 'Madeleine'.But Hitchcock leans out too far here, twice, and thus it collapses. Geddes tries to cast herself in Stewart's 'starring role', but spoils the vision. And having nowhere to go narratively, Novak is 'cast out'.Don't see this especially for the plot or vision, but do experience it for that magnificent cascading Herrmann score, which is flawless.",Vertigo
244,rollernerd,Colorfully Twisted Into Madness,7,7 March 2021,"Welcome back to another edition of Adam's Reviews!! **queue in intro music**Tonight's Hitchcock movie review is the mystery noir thriller Vertigo (1958) starring the legendary no-nonsense, James Stewart who plays the grounded police detective, John ""Scottie"" Ferguson. Scottie goes through a traumatic experience of acrophobia, the fear of heights during a nasty rooftop chase across the rooftops of San Francisco. Hence the movie is titled Vertigo, a sensation of fear of heights. As Scotty slowly recovers from this experience, he forces himself to retire from the force and regain his health, that is until an old college buddy comes out of the woodwork and asks Scottie to use his police know-how to privately investigate the strange habits of his wife, Madeleine Elster played by the brilliant Kim Novak. The story changes its tone from trauma to supernatural where Madeleine is haunted and sometimes possessed by her great grandmother, Carlotta Valdes. Soon Scottie falls into a web of love and deceit as he becomes transfixed by Madeleine and her obsessions.Firstly, Kim Novak's performance as the Femme Fatale is really what drives this film. James Stewart is, of course, brilliant. But Novak is superb in playing a complicated character where even if she has basic human flaws she is still untouchable as she shows how intense and passionate she can be to the right man. Her counterpart, the leading James Stewart, a man of all seasons plays a failed police officer and tries to redeem himself twice with his failure. His display of a man who is going through channels of frustration, limitation due to his acrophobia and his self-empowerment to overcome his fear. But the filmmakers make his character very annoying in the third and final act of this film. Scottie's obsession was inexplicable to me where he keeps pushing and pushing to not only find the truth but also for his redemption. And the reasoning for this in the movie was weak by not giving him a strong and clear enough motivation for going over the edge. Like did his previous romantic attachment with Madge end due to his obsessive nature? Due to his man of all seasons approach where he projects a grounded character it was hard for me to see how much of an obsessive nut case he is in the flick. But the script didn't help Stewart and again the character was wayyyy too annoying.The technical side of things are amazing in this film. This is a film noir in colour portrays the desperation and of madness, which creeps up on Scottie slowly and angrily. The most pleasing elements of the film are the beautiful soft-focus scenery and the dramatic and swooning score by film music genius, Bernard Herrmann, whose hypnotic opening titles and the fantasy sequences including the lady with the red lipstick (possibly Novak) just hypnotises you. This is also demonstrated with Herrmann's score dueing Scotties nightmare sequence. Hitchcock's avant-garde and cartoon graphics make the tumble into madness even more stunningly beautiful. And let us not forget about ""The Dolly Zoom"" camera trick!!Another major theme in this film are the green and red colours. This element can be seen during interesting depictions of madness throughout dreams and illusions that our leading man deals with. The element of colour in this flick creates the mood for each scene. The main colours Hitchcock plays with are green, purple and red, for example Kim Novak is often bathed in coloured green, whether it is her dress, her green car or her surroundings, which gives you a dream like supernatural feel that allows endless interpretations.However this all takes a bad tumble in the third and final act of the film. Firstly, why reveal the twist like two-thirds of the way into the film. Not knowing for certain up until the very end whether ""Judy"" was really ""Madeleine"" or whether Scottie was indeed just imagining things would have been much MUCH more effective. This film was unpredictable and a guessing game so once you knew that Scottie is not insane and just obsessive I was no longer connected to this story. And like I mentioned earlier, I was just annoyed of the character. Scottie's fall into madness with making him right, just makes the character plain stupid. And the ending - what's with that?! It's absolutely ridiculous and so abrupt!! Why couldn't she slip off the edge and then have Scottie try but fail to save her - thus mirroring his failure to save the cop at the beginning of the movie from falling, giving the whole thing a neat little symmetry?? Like comonnnnnnnnn!!!To me this film is visually stunning, from set production designs, costume designs, the music score, usage of colour like the green neon lights in the hotel but this is no masterpiece and far from Hitchcock's greatest work. The film was disconnected once the third and final act commenced which is a shame for a beautifully made film in a visual manner, overall 7/10",Vertigo

For starters, the color in this film was just plain and utterly amazing. I guess people back in 1958 were way more amazed than I am. Also, this has one of the most twist endings ever in film. I will tell you when I tell you the plot. Anyway, this also has a brilliant score by Hermann. It is definitely one of his best Hitchcock film scores.

A ex-detective with acrophobia is hired by a man named Elster to look after his wife while he is not around. Elster thinks that his wife is possessed by the ghost of Carlotta. Carlotta killed herself, and Elster thinks that his wife named Madeleine will do the same thing. When Scottie is following her he becomes obsessed with her. Then one day she commits suicide by jumping off a bell tower on a church. He is heartbroken by the death. Then later he meets Judy Barton, who looks a lot like Madeleine. He becomes obsessed with Judy. He actually makes her dress like Madeleine, change her hair color to match Madeleine's, and even style her hair like Madeleine's. Then he takes her up the bell tower to reenact the scene with Madeleine, only he hopes to save her and get rid of that memory. Then Scottie finds out that Judy was with him all along. She was working for Elster. He dressed Judy up to look like Madeleine. Elster killed Madeleine and threw her body out of the bell tower. Judy then falls out of the bell tower to her death.Overall, this is a fantastic suspense film done by Hitchcock. Although it is not his best work, it is still fantastic. Sometimes in this movie, though, it did not feel like a Hitchcock film at all. It felt like something else, I just do not what, though. Anyway, you know why Judy and Madeleine look so darn alike? Well, they were both portrayed by the same exact actress. Speaking of performance, James, or Jimmy, Stewart's performance was great, as well as psychotic. This is a very thrilling suspense film that every fan of suspense, as well as Hitchcock, will love.9/10Recommended Films: Psycho, and North By Northwest.",Vertigo
247,tcchelsey,A CREEPTASTIC HITCH MOVIE!,10,17 December 2020,"I have to tell you that after watching this truly eerie classic for decades, and actually growing up watching it, I have personally gone through as many mood changes as Scottie (James Stewart) himself. That's Hitchcockian, for sure! Looking back, I can recall in my teens and twenties taking this all in with a grain of salt and a laugh. Many years later, it became more depressing and in a way something you can relate to, again in a strange Hitchcockian sort of way! Go figure. But that is the magic of hitch and will always remain so. This is one helluva movie, and not to be forgotten. For today's audiences and tastes, it may be refreshing as it deals with the supernatural, and hints of such popular programs as THE DEAD FILES and GHOST ADVENTURES etc. There is so much to this, multiple viewings are recommended, to say the least. In short, you have to feel for Scottie who is literally cast in the atypical Hitch dilemma as being caught between a rock and a hard place, only this time, it's a case of an all too confused gent in love with a ghost! Or is he? Or is he the biggest fool of all time entangled in a dynamic scam of scams? You be the judge. One thing for certain, Kim Novak has never been more beautiful and you can take that to the bank. She most definitely plays the ultimate Hitch femme fatale, perhaps one of his best leading ladies in all his films. This is ultimate late night viewing that will keep you up late and thinking about days afterward. A one of a kind movie with a stand out script and likewise supporting cast, including the great Lee Patrick, who always delivers, whether it be dramatic or comedic. If not, add this one to your dvd file ASAP.",Vertigo

The chemistry between Stewart and Novak was good, but very melodramatic. And their leap to ""love"" was ham-fisted and clunky. Probably 'cause of when it was made.And what Novak did was pretty serious. I don't know how you like a character after that. And why would the bad guy just leave the loose-end of Novak in SF? If he's got the drive to kill his wife, then why not Novak?And if Novak loved Steward so much, she didn't try to re-connect or see him?I liked what Hitchcock did with Stewart's obsession but bordered on over-acting. It did breath more than movies of today. At over two hours it didn't seem that slow. Today they want to get audiences in and out for more showings. I wouldn't say an 8 out of 10. 7.8. It had all the markings of solid movie without the spark some films have (but with more flaws). But again, I think I'm suffering from a generational disconnect.",Vertigo

James Stewart plays a retired police detective who is hired by an old friend to follow his wife Kim Novak, whom he suspects of being possessed by the spirit of a dead madwoman.

255,noahgibbobaker,"Hugely influencial, massively dense, masterful.",9,22 May 2021,"Alfred Hitchcock's tale of retrocausality, relationships, manipulation, betrayal, desire, deceit, love, identity, obsession - it's dense.John 'Scottie' Ferguson, an ex-detective is hired to follow a friend's (Gavin Elster) wife under irresistible circumstances; hilarity ensues and the true nature of 'Vertigo' is methodically revealed.We know little of the past of our characters, we know events that affect the present, and future, but nothing more. The film is more about present relationships, all impactful in their own ways. From each encounter Scottie has, we learn more about him, his relations and the story being told.Vibrant colours are used not only to add visual flair, but to elevate the story by representing different feelings and acts. Red = love &/or danger, green = deceit etc. It's a treat to look at and interpret every moment from the colours alone; the colour grading is really amazing, I haven't seen another film so vibrant, pristine or purposeful, ever, let alone from this period. I believe the dolly zoom was pioneered here too. These are only a couple of examples of the innovative filmmaking involved - innovative filmmaking that went on to change cinema forever.Hitchcock was always a master of manipulation, time and time again he gaslights his audience - in this case Scottie along with us - for extended periods until the time is right to reveal the truth. We are given the right information at the right moments in order to create nail-biting tension and enough curiosity in the viewer required for an exciting viewing experience as well as an intellectual one.My favourite moment is when Scottie decides to buy Judy clothing identical to Madeleine's. Scottie has reached a new low and is obsessed with what he once thought he had, same goes for Judy. This reasonably short scene encapsulates the idea that knowing your love was never real is far more painful than that love being taken from you. It also shows what lengths both of these people are willing to go to in order to rekindle the love they thought they once had. It is a desperate attempt to repeat something that was nothing more than constructed, like the Carlotta portrait is constructed and like they each constructed themselves to be with the other. It was only once the attempt to love something neither Scottie or Judy loved was made, that they realised that there isn't any hope.",Vertigo
256,thenolanfan,Review - Vertigo,9,22 November 2020,"I rated this film 7/10, 2 years ago. I had no idea how this film was great. Today, it is quite embarrassing. Now, what is going to be embarrassing in 2 years are the spelling mistakes of this review!!!
Over the years, Vertigo has become Hitchcock's ""usual masterpiece"" sometimes even surpassing Psycho, and I think that the debate has a good reason for existing. Psycho was and still out of the two the most influential and the most accessible film. Vertigo talks more about Hitchcock as a man and as a director, especially concerning women.
Another great aspect of Vertigo's that it addresses a genre not often explored in films, which I would call ""psychological romance"". Rather than focusing on the private eye part of the story, it tells how James Stewart's character fell in love/lust with a woman that didn't exist and how in return, Judy, the woman's impersonator, fell in love with that man.Vertigo's an excellent film, but if you are a neophyte, I recommend that you watch Psycho before. As I said earlier, Vertigo's not as accessible.",Vertigo
257,Panamint,Film-making as art,10,17 June 2005,"If you view this film as if looking at a work of art, you get a new perspective on it. The use of color, the music, opening sequence, camera work, etc all blend into one piece of artwork. As with any work of art, one person loves it, the next person doesn't understand it. That explains the wide variety of opinion about ""Vertigo"".When I first watched it years ago I too got caught up in looking for the usual elements of ""a thriller"", ""a psychological drama"", ""a love story"", etc. Seeing and hearing the restored version has made me forget about all that and realize that this film is art for art's sake. I believe Hitchcock intended it to be so, because he tells us. For example, Scottie talks to Madeleine, he standing outside the car, viewing her in driver seat from the same perspective as the viewer of the car in Tamara DeLempicka's ""Green Bugatti"". Also, Midge says that she is reverting to her ""first love, art"". Scottie figures out what has happened by remembering the necklace from the painting of Carlotta. And, of course, some scenes are in an art museum.Some great movies are cultural icons and deserve a place in the Smithsonian or in movie museums, some more so than ""Vertigo"".

Variety magazine said said the film showed Hitchcock's ""mastery"", but was too long and slow for ""what is basically only a psychological murder mystery"". However as time passed, Vertigo was met with vigorous excitement and favourability and has since become a classic, analysed and re-analysed so many times.The story of an acrophobic detective (James Stewart), who retires from the force and is later hired by a wealthy businessman to observe his wife's bizarre behaviour, claiming that she might be possessed.

259,higherall7,The Killing Obsession...,10,28 November 2020,"This is an absolute treat! Here is another candidate for the greatest film of all time. A true work of Art that obeys the laws of increasing returns. The more you see it, the richer the experience as you see things you did not notice before, and connect concepts that did not occur to you upon previous viewings. In a word, the more you return to it, the more you get out of it. There are works of art whether dealing with subjects tragic or comic, that seem to reward the viewer or participant with a rich cornucopia of advancing understandings; depending upon what the party brings to the STONE SOUP. And hopefully, you will be bringing more than a knife and a fork and a napkin. VERTIGO belongs to such a category.This is a film that deals with and treats the subject of obsession while being made and crafted out of the very ingredients that are obsession itself; i.e., idealism, beauty, love, images and loss. Dealing with obsession, it would not be hard for moviegoers to find themselves becoming obsessed with VERTIGO. Many may find themselves coming back again and again to plumb the depths of its meaning just short of a trance-like addiction. This is the type of Art that people endlessly analyze and dissect somewhere in a cafe in Paris, until the wee hours of the morning, with everyone involved making a valid contribution of insight during the round table discussion, and finally saying their goodbyes and leaving for home feeling refreshed and fulfilled. VERTIGO activates and excites and mystifies the intelligence and the imagination with it haunting imagery and soulful references.Just going over what Martin Scorsese related about VERTIGO, among other reviewers, I learned two or three new things about Hitchcock's masterpiece I had not fully considered before. Becoming obsessed about winning and success is often highly lauded in sports and the affairs of the world, but here in VERTIGO, Hitchcock reveals it as a phenomena of entropy and demonstrates its full potential for cyclic destruction. These are heady and deep waters, bordering on the philosophical and an able insight of one of the reviewers also helped me to see this film as a sort of confessional for Hitchcock in a highly personal way.There is a pernicious evil that runs throughout the narrative as a main thread and yet it is not wholly represented by any of the characters. One could easily make a good argument for taking the point of view that in one way or another, all the characters are pawns of and in some way serving the spirit of obsession. Yes, one could make that argument, while others at the round table might vigorously shake their heads and assert, no, that's not all there is to it. VERTIGO is like a prism that seems to reflect all the various shades of obsession. It is almost as though Hitchcock is saying, ""Here, I've shown you mine, now take a look and consider your own...""The wonder is that most of these themes concerning obsession are encapsulated more in the characters and their reactions rather the story itself. James Stewart's character, John 'Scottie' Ferguson, is defined more by weakness and inability than he is by strength and ability, and when he finally pieces everything together to posit a solution, he only causes further destruction. He is a true anti-hero in the same way that Hamlet is an anti-hero. Kim Novak, playing the dual roles of Madeleine Elster and Judy Barton, speaks poignantly to the angst of women allowing themselves to be trapped in the roles men craft for them for love and money. There is plenty of fodder for speculation about the Madonna/Whore complex should you care to go that route. It strikes me as her best performance. Here she has trapped and helped exploit the weakness of the detective with her beauty for gain, but now is caught in the fabric and fictive web of a predetermined doom. Konstantin Shayne as the Art Historian Pop Leibel is a fascinating character, and after he provides Ferguson and the unrequited lover Midge Wood played by Barbara Bel Geddes, with the additional information they desire, it's hard to tell whether he has clarified matters or merely led them into even murkier waters.VERTIGO has the rhythms of great theater, and delivers a sophisticated dramatic payoff that you see more often on the stage than in the movie house. From the spiral motifs of graphic designer Saul Bass in the opening credits to the almost hallucinatory flashbacks and the nightmare sequence of a distraught Ferguson accompanied by the foreboding and at times alarming score of Bernard Hermann we go down the rabbit hole of fate and destiny as revealed by nature of the characters themselves. Despite the fact that three screenwriters were involved with the scrIpt for VERTIGO, including Maxwell Anderson, Hitchcock's sure hand and masterly restraint points more to him as the author of this story than either Anderson, Alec Coppel or Samuel Taylor. It comes across as a deeply personal statement signed off for by the director, that the evil represented in the story is about something more than the machinations of Tom Helmore as Gavin Elster plotting to finish off a burdensome wife, and is actually exploring evil as the lack of something and the failure to see something for what it actually is and what it can actually do.",Vertigo

This doesn't.Don't get me wrong, it's still a good film, very good maybe & has one or two brilliant twists but there's too many faults with.SpoilersIt's a good 20 minutes too long, once Madeline returns as Judy some of the scenes really take a bit of believing. What sort of woman lets a man alter everything about her within 5 minutes of meeting her. If she wanted him to discover her true identity why not say so? She was identical once the clothes were bought.I wasn't too enthralled with the ending either and thought Gavin may have made another appearance.I can't make up my mind about James Stewart either. I watch it's a Wonderful Life & Shenandoah & think he plays the part brilliantly and think him the best actor ever. Then I watch this & see him almost identical to most of his other roles, including the aforementioned ones. I get the same emotion watching Adam Sandler or Ross in Friends. They're drab & look like they need a good kick up the backside to put some emotion & ooomph into their lines.It was a great idea of a plot with a fantastic twist. I just got the feeling it could've been done a bit better, especially the second half.All that aside though, I'd still recommend this.

That is coming from a 16 year old boy who has grown into a generation of CGI movies etc. I have loved every moment of 'Rear Window', 'Psycho', 'North by Northwest' and 'Notorious' which are all in my Top 30. However, I was disappointed when my Flickchart account granted 'Vertigo' as 67. There is something about this movie that isn't as propelling as Hitch's other movies. Whether it be the story or the characters, I do not know but at times I found myself a little bored during the movie which is strange as I could not get bored watching Rear Window which takes a lot of time to get going. The acting is great. Jimmy Stewart is fantastic in the movie as Scottie as is Kim Novak in her double role. The writing to the film is good but there is something about the script that isn't as interesting as Hitch's 'Notorious' or 'Psycho' for that matter.As 'Vertigo' is now considered the number 1 movie of all time, I was a little surprised at how I viewed this movie certain times. Unlike other Hitch movies, in which the story is very straightforward, 'Vertigo' is very deep and far more complex in comparison to other movies by him. The characters do seem to have more depth to them but there is some feeling for me that this movie is definitely not a movie I enjoyed as much as Rear Window, Notorious or even North by NorthwestMy Flickchart-Rear Window- 9 Notorious- 12 North by Northwest- 19 Psycho- 36 Vertigo- 67 Now, don't get me wrong. I do not get bored of movies because they have no action, its just the dialogue tended to drag on a bit and some scenes just had a certain tedious feel to it.

264,Catharina_Sweden,Worth watching for James Stewart and Kim Novak,7,15 April 2015,"As with many movies from this era I find it a bit naive. The story is ingenious of course, but I do not believe anybody would use it for a production for an adult audience today. The mumbo-jumbo element is too improbable and immature - also when it turns out that is was a false lead. It is a typical plot for a mystery novel or TV series for 11- 15 year old girls. I did not find the movie especially suspenseful or scary either, despite of it being a Hitchcock movie.With this said, I enjoyed the movie for the actors. I love James Stewart - he was so handsome and stylish as a middle-aged man, and he also had that decent and wholesome aura. As a woman, one feels that one should be safe and secure with a husband like that - at the same time that one's hormones would be working overtime! :-) That is a very unusual combination in a man.Kim Novak is also perfect in her role. She was very pretty at this time - although never on par with the great Hollywood beauties, such as Greta Garbo, Ingrid Bergman, Ava Gardner or Elizabeth Taylor. Novak shows here that she could play both the Lady and the Tramp - two totally different character types. One thing that is a bit strange though, is that ""Judy"" could not play the role of ""Madeleine"" better in the latter part of the movie, when she had got to the stage that she wanted to do everything to please ""Scottie"". I mean: when she had played that role so successfully in the early part of the story, she ought to have been able to use the same posture, the same way of walking, the same modulated speech etc. also if she had no one to coach her anymore. That was a big plot-hole, really. Also, as many others who have commented here, I think it was a mistake to reveal the solution to the mystery so early on. That made the remaining part of the movie less interesting - although one still wanted to know if ""Scottie"" would forgive ""Judy"" and be able to love her as herself.",Vertigo

266,ryan-10075,Another Hitchcock Masterpiece,10,21 September 2020,"Just saw this Alfred Hitchcock gem on the big screen for the second time a couple weeks ago and while watching the film I admitted to myself that on my fifth viewing of the film it is still extremely impressive and yes I do believe it is a masterpiece.James Stewart plays Scottie who was a former San Francisco cop. We witness him in the opening scene chasing a criminal and suddenly realizing that he has vertigo. An old college acquaintance Gavin Elster would like him to tail his wife Madeleine (played by the beautiful Kim Novak) because she is acting so strangely. In turn Scottie becomes horribly obsessed with her and some of the dark and terrible secrets that she hides.This film to me has some truly beautiful shots such as Madeleine at the Golden Gate Bridge, Scottie tailing Madeleine (like in the art gallery that Brian de Palma stole for DRESSED TO KILL) and climbing the steps in the bell tower at the convent. Novak is great in her portrayal of two characters and in her introduction when she is introduced to not only Scottie, but us the viewer she just pops off the screen. With her black and green dress and the red background Hitchcock to me makes me certainly stare at her just as Scottie was doing. Barbara Bel Geddes also puts in a great performance as Scottie's friend and old fiancee Midge Wood. She seems to create a very interesting love triangle of sorts as she still loves Scottie. To me though James Stewart is just terrific! As the story progresses we see Scottie go through some extremely scary moments and in the end turns into someone who has a life-controlling unhealthy obsession that I think is handled perfectly by Hitchcock.A film I tell people is a must-see and perhaps partly because it was filmed in 1958 it does leave some unanswered questions that you or your mind must fill in for yourself (something I think sadly modern audiences don't fully enjoy doing), but also because it was filmed by one of the greatest directors of all time in Alfred Hitchcock. A film I also don't watch all the time, likely because the wonder and mystery of the film works so wonderfully.",Vertigo

268,ferdinand1932,Pretentious miss,6,20 September 2010,"Despite it's elevated status, which has come from criticism and academic analysis, Vertigo remains a boring experience, even with many interesting thematic facets.Hitchcock told Truffaut that the interest/suspense in Vertigo is what Scottie might do. That question had been the bedrock of Hitchcock's cinema but Scottie as played by Stewart is too ambiguous; he is reactive and weak. The lack of vigor in the character makes his falling love with with Madeleine barely believable, and his constant pleading with her is altogether too weak.Compounding the problems is the plot, the structural mechanism, of the story that is also not believable. The orchestration of the scheme requires credibility and here it is strained: the choice of policeman; the discovery of Judy etc it's rather like those English mysteries that Raymond Chandler mocked because it is contingent on rare elements to bind the entire piece together.And Novak's performance, which despite a reappraisal recently, seems to demonstrate that she never really progressed beyond the nervous rabbit role play at drama school. She is , as the expression has it, wise with a closed mouth, but once she speaks the mystery is gone. Her eyebrows are also quite frightening.Vertigo has great music, locations and an intriguing idea for a story (one that would have been gripping in a novel); but equally it has dull driving scenes, over written dialog (Pop's story in the bookstore) and two lead actors who are far from ideal. This is one film when the themes and not the material on screen excites comment, and more film Phds no doubt, but it is pretentious miss in Hitchcock's golden decade.",Vertigo
269,frankwiener,In Circular Motion,9,8 January 2017,"From the very start, Saul Bass's innovative introduction, reportedly the first ever to use computer graphics, sets the film's overall circular motif in motion. The physically debilitating condition of vertigo, which is triggered by the central character's acrophobia, is the engine that generates all of the events that follow.Several reviewers here focus on this film's status as ""number one"" among at least some lists devised by critics who actually dare to rank movies, and these same writers spend an inordinate amount of time and effort challenging its high position. For what it's worth, I have created a list of my favorite 150 movies of all time, and ""Vertigo"" is right there along with seven other of Alfred Hitchcock's greatest masterpieces, but I personally find the numerical ranking of movies, including the best of them, to be all but impossible. How could I possibly rank in numerical order the movies that I love the most?I find it interesting that Bernard Hermann based his remarkable, ever changing musical score on the Wagner opera, ""Tristan and Isolde"". Although I am not an opera expert, that music has always suggested a circular motion much in the same way that Hermann's score, especially the opening theme, creates the dizzying sensation that the physical condition of vertigo produces in its victims.James Stewart, Kim Novak, and Barbara Bel Geddes are excellent in their roles, especially Stewart, whose character, John (Scotty) Ferguson, experiences a wide range of powerful and complicated psychological conditions, which could not have been easy to portray. Regardless of how Hitchcock was reported to feel about her performance, I believe that Novak brings just the right amount of mystery, intricacy, and physical beauty to both Madeleine and Judy. Lana Turner, also considered for the lead, would not have offered the same depth and complexity to the role. I also appreciated supporting cast members Ellen Corby as the peculiar apartment house manager (did she know more than what she appeared to know?) and Henry Jones as the anal retentive trial official who publicly humiliates Ferguson in a devastatingly cruel way through elevated but stilted language.In addition to the excellent direction, musical score, and acting, the magnificent cinematography of Robert Burks, who maximizes the photogenic setting of San Francisco and its picturesque surroundings, and the intelligent screenplay by Samuel A. Taylor have kept ""Vertigo"" on my own list of favorites after nearly six decades and many repeated viewings. Please don't ask me to rank it numerically. It's way up there.",Vertigo

It was a year of great female performances and the 5 nominees were : Elizabeth Taylor, Shirley McClaine, Deborah,Kerr, Roz Russell, and the winner Susan Hayward.This movie was not well received when it was first released but now in retrospect 60 years later is considered the finest American film of all time. Much of the praise must go to Kim Novak who gives a stunning brilliant in the performance of a lifetime. Kim Novak is so beautiful in this Vertigo.. I don't think any other star other than Garbo could have done what Kim did in Vertigo.",Vertigo
272,carlos37andre,Great,8,16 April 2020,"The movie is great. However, the subtle messages aside, I didn't buy their love, and I didn't think they had chemistry at all, Johnny and Midge had way more chemistry. I get it tho, that Hitchcock was trying to show a man that chooses based on his understanding of ""perfection"", and because he barely knows Madeline/Judy tbh, he falls in love for her lack of flaws, in contrast with Midge's evident flaws and weaknesses. I also think the whole plot of his relationship with Midge stays so unsolved, she just disappears at some point and never comes back.The scene she shows him the picture is so strange tho lol.I know the movie can mean many things, to many people, However, one of the meanings I think it could have is that it truly tells a story about love, loving the ""wrong"" woman for only her outside, and still, making the same mistake again. That been Scottie ""losing"" Madeline twice in the movie, almost in the same way (at least, in the same context).The acting is good in the movie. I thought Barbara Bel Geddes was so great! Every time she was on screen it was delightful, and I wanted to see her more. That's one of the reasons why I was upset her story sort of didn't have an ending.James Stewart is good in the movie, I thought he did good most of the time. And I think Kim Novak is fine, I don't know, I think one of the major reasons why I didn't buy the romance, was because of her performance, even the kiss scenes look weird. She isn't bad, she is just not my favorite performance in the movie.At the end, did she really die tho?

In Madeleine Elster, there is the cliché of hopeless hope of self-awareness, and then there is the ambition without any cognitive power from the learned.The Italia, not in any way affiliated with the Italian mafia, is a real structure. A woman, who stands against a wall and waits at the end of a large industrial facility (MezMex) - she is real, and she is The Italia (Madeline Elster's true calling).Elster isn't this woman's rival; she is an equivalent of learned in her own right, relative to this woman.There is the ambition, that in all of movie history, one movie character is real, and fakes their identity as a movie character; naturally, this sort of reach of learned invokes the same deconstruction of nature: Elster wouldn't just be fake, but she would be fate.The Italia still stands and waits",Vertigo
274,brefane,Dizzy plot,7,21 July 2010,"Considered by many to be Hitchcock's masterpiece, Vertigo is overrated and not really one of Hitchcock's best films. Great, even good films, get better with repeated viewings, but not Vertigo. Despite Bernard Hermann's seductive score, excellent cinematography by Robert Burks, an interesting set up, and a story replete with Hitchcok's ironies and themes subsequent viewings make Gavin Elster's convoluted plot to murder his wife with Stewart's Scottie as an unwitting witness seems utterly preposterous, and impossible to pull off and stage. Surely, there are easier ways to get away with murder! And so much time is spent setting Scottie up for the fall that in retrospect much of it seems gratuitous. The overcomplicated murder plot recalls Hitchcok's stiff and stagy, Dial M for Murder(54). The plotting rather than the execution makes Vertigo inferior Hitchcock even though in many respects it's his most personal and audacious film. Much of the dialog between Stewart and Novak's Madelaine is awkward and tedious, and unnecessarily drawn out; one of the film's best sequences employs virtually no dialog. Both Saul Bass' animated dream sequence and Barbara Bel Geddes' Madge feel unnecessary as well. Nonetheless, Vertigo is an interesting film with the parts being better than the whole, and the less you know about it the better. Novak's wispy persona was never better suited to a film role, and Stewart's pale blue eyes are downright vertiginous. Recommended.",Vertigo

278,brianberta,An emotionally complex masterpiece.,10,29 August 2016,"This is definitely my favorite Hitchcock film. When I first watched it, I viewed it as a tragic romance film, but only with future viewings did I really how wrong this reading was and that, in reality, Scottie was dangerous and obsessive. For instance, after Madeleine jumped into a river in an apparent suicide attempt, Scottie's way of handling the situation was by bringing her to his house, undressing her, and leaving her in his bed without telling anybody what happened (a doctor, a neighbor, or even Midge or Gavin, at the very least). If this doesn't make him creepy, I honestly don't know what would. The less time he spends with Midge and the more time he spends around Madeleine, the more clear it is that he's emotionally damaged and that the movie is about the dangers of his obsession, which extend to his fixation on Madeleine in place of Midge, his creepy behavior and demands with Judy, or the reveal that Gavin chose Scottie out of the likely hundreds of acquaintances he had since he knew that Scottie was the only person peculiar and strange enough that his elaborate scheme could possibly depend on. In spite of what we learn about the other characters in the final act, I think the full extent to Scottie's emotional damage is revealed during this part of the film (most of this is caused by Gavin and Judy though) and, as a result, we ultimately fear for Judy and are on her side.There's also a few other things I love about this film. For one, Hitchcock utilizes technicolor better than almost every film I can think of. Through its red and green color pallet, it's able to convey such a strong emotional reaction, with red indicating danger and green indicating lust. Also, I've seen some people express boredom over Scottie tailing Madeleine by car, but I find that sequence to be an excellent slice of slow-burning tension. In fact, most of that sequence consists of Scottie driving downhill (San Francisco is a coastal city and has a number of hills), symbolizing his descent into obsession. It's a great touch to that sequence which makes it all the more atmospheric. I also loved the terrific dream sequence in the middle as, instead of feeling unnecessary, it was actually a product of Scottie's damaged emotional state. Lastly, I think the ending is perfect. Yes, it's abrupt, but intentionally so as the abruptness and confusion of it matches Scottie's headspace. The emotions it leaves me with linger long after the credits, anyways.Overall, this is an emotionally complex masterpiece which never ceases to blow me away. Rear Window used to be my favorite Hitchcock film, but it lost its throne to this film a couple years ago.",Vertigo
279,HelloTexas11,a film for the ages,10,31 March 2008,"It's not hard to see why Alfred Hitchcock's 'Vertigo' is considered one of the greatest films ever made. It is a beautifully textured and layered movie, mysterious and confusing, but in a good sense. It's a pity really that it has to come to an end and have it's many components 'explained;' the enjoyment one gets is from imagining all the possibilities conjured up in one's head while watching it. 'Vertigo' might be called an art film masquerading as mainstream entertainment, an apt if ironic description given its subject matter. The plot, to put it as simply as possible- a detective falls in love with a woman twice, the second time not realizing it is the same woman. She deceives him into thinking she is someone else, both times. A two-page synopsis of the various ins and outs of the story would do it no more justice. James Stewart plays the detective, Scottie Ferguson. I've always wondered why Hitchcock chose Stewart to play this role. Being the great actor he was, he does a fine job and is very convincing, but if I were to have read this script at the time and been asked to think of, say, fifty working actors to consider for the part, James Stewart would have come in fifty-first. There just is nothing in the actor's previous body of work to suggest he is right for the character in any way. The gangly, drawling, slow-talking, clearheaded, common-sensed Everyman made perfect sense for a movie like 'It's A Wonderful Life.' But to play an obsessed, neurotic, acrophobic, compulsive control freak who practically forces himself on a woman and insists she dress up like the presumed-dead, former object of his affections... Jimmy Stewart? You've got to be joking. And yet somehow it works. Kim Novak as the woman is easier to figure out. She was the latest in a series of icy blondes just waiting to be unfrozen in Hitchcock films; this was a continuing theme in his movies that would continue long past 'Vertigo.' Novak captures the strange Madeleine and more common Judy very well; it is quite believable that the second character is, at first, intended to be a completely different woman. Much of the magic of 'Vertigo' comes from not only wondering what will happen next, but pondering what has just happened, and what it means. Rational explanations become less and less interesting. This is what I meant about the ending- outside of a supernatural one, there's almost no way a movie like 'Vertigo' can have a completely satisfactory outcome. One certainly has to give Hitchcock credit for coming as close as possible. He was not one for the paranormal anyway (I suppose 'The Birds' comes closest); his flights of fantasy have more to do with human motivations and the bizarre, sometimes insane workings of the mind. 'Vertigo' takes this approach, and in the characters of Scottie and Madeleine/Judy, shows the most extreme manifestations of desire, submission, and delusion.",Vertigo

Well you would enjoy films like these only when you allow your mind to go into that time. And do not compare the techniques of today with that of oldies. It is not necessary to keep this in mind for every film but for this film you will certainly need to keep this in mind. And for the movie, I would say the editing could have been better because it seemed to be disorienting at some times.

283,Christopher_Reid,Ridiculously good.,10,3 May 2007,"I've only seen Vertigo twice but without a doubt it is one of my favourite films of all time. I admire everything about it from the beautiful locations and scenery to the haunting score by Bernard Herrmann, not to mention the intriguing plot which enhances the themes of the movie especially with multiple viewings. Some of the earlier scenes in the movie, for example, have magnified dramatic effect if the audience understands the position Madeleine is in.Jimmy Stewart is perfectly cast as John ""Scottie"" Ferguson, a retired detective with acrophobia (fear of heights) who is persuaded by an old friend to temporarily spy on his wife. Her behaviour is gradually becoming more and more odd and unpredictable and her husband wishes to understand why. Needless to say, the plot thickens and is as intricate as any other Hitchcock movie.One of the things that separates Vertigo from Hitchcock's other films however, is the dominance of the themes and characters over the suspense which is perhaps why many find it less entertaining than his other movies on first viewing. Once the central themes of Vertigo become clearer, I think very few films can have anywhere near as powerful an effect on their audiences. Several intense emotions such as love, guilt, obsession and regret are repeatedly experienced by the characters (and hence shared by the audience) and sometimes a mixture of these powerful emotions are present all at just one time.The score for Vertigo is one of the most haunting, romantic and beautiful pieces of music I've ever heard. It succeeds in expressing yearning, tragedy, love and even hope; sometimes all at once. Generally, I think the more personal and passionate a movie is, the more important the role of the music being used in it becomes since the purpose of music is typically to set the mood and tone. More intense themes need more intense music. In the case of Vertigo, I think a huge amount of the power of the movie comes from the music by Bernard Herrmann, arguably one of the greatest scores of all time by one of the greatest composers of all time.Vertigo is also very visually memorable and even haunting. It has images that you are unlikely to ever forget once you've seen it. The dream sequence in particular is amazingly effective and summarises perfectly the feelings of Scottie at that stage in the movie. As it certainly was for Scottie, Vertigo is an experience you are unlikely to ever forget.As long as you watch it a couple of times :)",Vertigo
284,ags123,Beautiful,10,10 December 2014,"Once you've seen ""Vertigo"" you can almost see the whole thing again in your head. Its haunting images stay with you. Whatever else you might say about ""Vertigo,"" (and there are those who don't like it), it's unquestionably a visually beautiful film. It formed my impressions of San Francisco, and when I finally visited that city, it all seemed so familiar. In fact, many of the locations remain unchanged after more than fifty years - Mission Dolores, The Brocklebank Apartments, The Legion of Honor, The Palace of Fine Arts, Fort Point. You can even stay in the same Sutter Street hotel where ""Judy"" lived (The Empire Hotel is now the Hotel Vertigo). If I can find fault at all with this film, I point to James Stewart who, despite a great performance, looks too old for the part and his chemistry with Kim Novak is dubious (Much better in their other 1958 outing, ""Bell, Book and Candle""). When ""Vertigo"" failed at the box office on its initial release, Hitchcock is said to have blamed it on Stewart, and I tend to believe it. After four films together, he never used him again. Nevertheless, ""Vertigo"" entertains on many levels. I don't even mind the unexplained and illogical sequences (Madeleine waking up nude in Scottie's bed and neither one of them making an issue of it; her disappearance from The McKittrick Hotel). And I'm impressed by the downbeat and abrupt ending, which surely was unusual for a Hollywood film at that time. ""Vertigo"" is in a class by itself.",Vertigo

In fact a special animated nightmare sequence pounds on the brain of our hero Jimmy Stewart. This was a special sequence designed by John Ferren, an American artist of the time.Add in the music of Bernard Herman, who also knocked it out of the park with North by Northwest (1959), and the use of locations in and around beautiful San Francisco and Northern California and you have another winner.

James Stewart playing an ex-detective John 'Scottie' Ferguson has fear of heights. He is requested by one good old friend to follow and watch his wife's abnormal behavior at times. Doing so, John gets dangerously obsessed with her and things starts to complicate. Movie is like a ticking time bomb, keeps you puzzled, revealing important twists time to time. Like any other Hitchcock work, here you feel and live what characters feel and live. James as the lead actor does an astounding job. Kim Novak is gorgeous and magnetic as Madeleine Elster but somewhat mechanical as Judy Barton. But Vertigo is not without its flaws. Other than lead characters, people keep disappearing just like that from the plot, like Kim's husband and James's friend. The whole focus is on James and his fear of heights. Going towards end, movie heightens the suspense but leaves you with a heartbreaking climax that somewhat lessens the overall impact.I am going with fantastic 8 out of 10 for Vertigo. It is controversially one of the best of Hitchcock but it is still way ahead in its genre.",Vertigo
288,JaydoDre,Storytelling issues prevent this from being a truly good film,6,22 July 2015,"This film has two major flaws, both story-related.The first issue is that right in the beginning of the film, and then later again, it smears on you a sudden thick layer of awkward exposition, like a cheap Japanese anime. This should not be in a professional piece of work like this.The second issue is that, as with all Hitchcock's movies I have seen so far, the story relies on one of the characters to be an idiot in order to work. The premise is that a detective affected by vertigo is asked by his old pal to solve a mystery around his wife's strange behavior and as you watch the events play out it becomes apparent fairly quickly that the main character is being played. It is obvious, and it should be particularly obvious to a detective, but the movie pretends like it is not.And so, as I kept watching the film I suddenly caught myself mentally hurrying it up. Yes, I get it, the main character is obsessed and is being played. Come on, get to it already, get to the reveal. As the movie was drawing out the inevitable, the famous Hitchcock's tension was starting to wear out its welcome, as the dialogue and the music were getting increasingly teary-eyed.And then, at around the 1:40 mark the story takes a nose dive. Instead of revealing the truth at the end of the film, it spills the beans right then by means of a second awkward exposition where the main twist if the film is simply shown to the audience in a flashback and then explained through the thoughts of one of the characters. Look, movie, I know I was mentally hurrying you up, but I did not mean for you to prematurely unload in the most unsatisfactory manner. What a letdown! The very ending is a bit problematic as well. It feels like the writer did not know for sure what to do with the two main characters after all the cards were on the table. The way the story is completed feels odd and somewhat rushed.It is a real shame because the performances are good. The main character played by James Stewart has a charm about him. The famous Hitchcock's tension is there. There are some special effects used including animation, which looked cool. Even the story at face value is quite interesting, but unfortunately it is also noticeably flawed.",Vertigo
289,seawalker,James Stewart's greatest performance,8,7 May 2007,"Although Hitchcock made good films before and after the 1950's, I think that the 50's were his true purple patch. Between 1950 and 1959 Hitchcock directed 11 movies. Here they are.""Stage Fright"" (1950). ""Strangers On A Train"" (1951). ""I Confess"" (1953). ""Dial M For Murder"" (1954). ""Rear Window"" (1954). ""To Catch A Thief"" (1955). ""The Trouble With Harry"" (1955). ""The Man Who Knew Too Much"" (1956). ""The Wrong Man"" (1956). ""Vertigo"" (1958). ""North By Northwest"" (1959).I challenge you to find a single clunker on that list. You won't, because there aren't any. I know the mechanics of Hollywood in the 50's were different, and there was a much faster turnaround of product, but 11 great films (some true classics) by the same Director in 10 years is going some and more. He never won an Oscar, but Hitchcock was a really great Director. That fact should never be forgotten.I have seen ""Vertigo"" on TV many a time, but never on the big screen. ""Vertigo"" might be Hitchcock's strangest film. Ostensibly it is a melodrama. (An ex-Detective, traumatised by the accidental death of a colleague, and suffering from a chronic fear of heights, is hired by an old friend to follow the friend's wife, as she has started behaving strangely.) Of course, the story is much deeper than that. ""Vertigo"" is about mental illness, obsession, betrayal and, yes, necrophilia. In a great career it could be James Stewart's greatest performance. ""Vertigo"" also looks beautiful and the colour scheme tells it's own story. (Red=health, green=illness.)It's a masterpiece. 'Nuff said.",Vertigo
290,Artimidor,"A killer combination - Stewart, Novak, Herrmann, Hitchcock and the perfect script",10,13 May 2012,"""Vertigo"" is one of those killer combinations where just about everything fits like a glove. For one there's the ingenious screenplay by Alec Coppel and Samuel Taylor based on the French novel ""D'Entre les Morts""(usually translated as ""From the Realm of the Dead""). It's a spellbinding narration of a retired San Francisco police detective who gets caught up in mysterious events with supernatural undertones, peppered by deception, betrayal, crime and obsession. Then there's the cast: John ""Scottie"" Ferguson is played in understated fashion by James Stewart, the epitome of the humble, humane gentleman and good friend who cannot deny a favor. Confronting him with mystifying blond sexbomb Kim Novak really gets things rolling and is electrifying to see. Every moment of the main characters' difficult relationship throughout the film is absolutely believable and their chemistry on screen evident and riveting. In the music department Bernard Herrmann once again outdoes himself with an engrossing score, which will make you hold your breath in anticipation of what lies ahead - or hit you right in the face whenever necessary, and that's a good thing. The cinematography? Pitch perfect. Locations like the Golden Gate Bridge shine in all their Technicolor glory as do striking camera shots like the one from the roof at the very beginning or those from the Old Mission San Juan Bautista bell tower.All the brilliance is carefully constructed and well held together by master director Alfred Hitchcock himself, who knows how to pull one into the film, how to get into the characters, how to make one dizzy (with style!) - and how to zoom in while at the same time physically pulling the camera back, the astonishing trademark shot of ""Vertigo"". A film to be watched again and again, practically flawless and all the way masterfully executed.",Vertigo
291,smellthecult-com-1,Paranoid thriller,9,27 September 2009,"Considered by many to be Hitchcock's masterpiece, I found this tougher going than I expected. James Stewart plays John 'Scottie' Ferguson, an ex-detective who was forced out of The Force when an arrest gone wrong left him with a debilitating fear of heights. An old pal of his asks him if he wouldn't mind putting his former policing powers to use to tail his wife, who is acting in a most peculiar manner. He's not worried that she is having an affair, but is instead concerned as she has taken to wandering off and spending hours on end by herself. Reluctantly, Scottie agrees and, in one of the most taut scenes in cinema history, stalks her through the evocative streets of San Francisco. She winds up beneath the Golden Gate Bridge and throws herself into the water, our hero rushing to her rescue. Well, it's not long before the two are in love, and Scottie's life is taken on the kind of tangent that could only happen in a Hitchcock movie. Dark, oppressive and utterly compelling, this is only really marred by the 'love' angle which, inevitably, I find tiresome. When ageing stars and starlets gaze into each others eyes and profess undying love I tend to drift off, and maybe fifteen minutes of this movie delved into such forbidden areas, and that's why I've docked a point. That aside, this is majestic movie-making, with Hitchcock's peerless vision drawing anxiety and claustrophobia from the most mundane of circumstances.

No one but Hitchocock could do it as good as this. An interesting thing to note, is that it was based on a French book by Pierre Boileau and Thomas Narcejac called ""D'Entre Les Morts"".

The bottom line is a very rigid ending, a (possible)miscasting for a major female character and nothing else. If the Oscar overlooked Hitchcock again solely for such reasons, I would say it's a bad joke.Technically stunning, this is the first words came to many critics. Visual effects should not be just defined as those special CG effects, but also the effects a movie's visual presentation on audiences. Vertigo is a case that such visual qualities affect you deeply. You must follow a woman, follow her wherever she goes, follow her beyond your logics and emotional boundary. Such a psychological process has been successfully presented using camera. Thanks to Stewart's emotional broken performance and Kim Novak's haunting existence, such a feeling is still as stunning and fascinating as 50 years ago.Contrast to my review, many critics listed Vertigo's ending as one of the best endings provided in Movie history. Tragedy and loss repeated itself and one must face his/her own deeds when it comes to judgment. That is my interpretation. However, it's also very obviously rigid. The entire movie has a strong undertone of tragedy, which renders Stewart's character into a sympathized object for many. If the protagonist would finally brought everything to justice and waited for Judy Button's release from jail, it would be perfectly logical, natural and positive. It seemed like they very intentionally made it a tragedy to the very last minute, which may be unnecessary. After all, it's a matter of taste.Except for that, Vertigo should have won best picture in Oscar, and many other awards. Sadly it didn't. But again, we see movies for good movies, not for Oscar.If Vertigo would teach us anything at all, that is ""do not trust beautiful women especially those who like you"". Magneto must be a Vertigo fan anyway. Ha ha!",Vertigo

Sure, he was limited to suspense films, but nobody-and I mean nobody could make more suspenseful films than Hitchcock. Vertigo is no exception.The great, yet strange storyline will leave you on the edge of your seat, as the detective Scottie follows around a woman who is perhaps possessed by the ghost of Carlotta Varde. Seemingly paranormal things happen, and the storyline is far from predictable. It takes twists and turns, and will leave you guessing and wanting more. You will wonder about the actions, and you will ask yourself ""What will happen next?"" When you finally guess, you will find your self surprised, shocked, but satisfied with the outcome.It's fairly realistic too. It takes place in San Francisco, and you will be astounded be all the familiar sights. Then again, there isn't one thing that isn't astounding about Vertigo.This movie makes a smart and fun thriller. Every minute is something fresh and new to satisfy your craving. It's one of my favorite movies. Nothing will make you hold your breath, or excite and bewilder you like Alfred Hitchcock's Vertigo.

It is also a film with great music. Great acting from Jimmy Stewart and Kim Novak. Novak a mysterious character that you cant quite figure out. Stewart the every day man that you root for.

298,patryk-czekaj,Describe the movie in one word: Excellence,10,23 May 2012,"If you have ever, even for a second, doubted Alfred Hitchcock's genius and mastery of the cinematic craft, you probably haven't seen Vertigo. I mean, all of his films are fantastic and should be considered as undisputed classics, but this particular flick has something in it that makes it seem, in my opinion, like the essential Hitchcock, the one to be called his best.I don't know whether it's the supernatural aura surrounding the whole story depicted in Vertigo or not, but I was caught in the storyline right from the beginning. It certainly is one of the greatest thrillers in the history of cinema, and one that will send chills down the spine even after more than 50 years after its premiere.'Scottie' Ferguson, a retired police detective, after experiencing the death of one oh his fellow co-workers, is trapped in the dizzy circle of vertigo, the strange and psychedelic state of nausea brought by the fear of heights. Even though it might seem like an insignificant fact at first, it is a crucial aspect needed to understand the whole story of Vertigo.One day he gets a rather strange request from Gavin Elster, a friend from the old college days. Even though he isn't working anymore, he accepts the assignment, which involves sneaking and spying on Elster's beautiful wife, Madeleine. She is supposed to be possessed by some sort of eerie forces or a ghost from the past, which makes her wander around town doing rather strange things. At first Scottie is very skeptical about the whole situation and simply laughs at the possibility of the involvement of some out-of-this-world creations. But as he gets deeper and deeper into this job he starts to believe that, indeed, something is not right. What's more, he falls in love with the woman on the way and wants to help her with all his heart. And then, suddenly, the Earth comes calling back – Madeleine commits suicide jumping out of a church's tower. Scottie is in a state of shock and isn't able to lead a normal life. Everywhere he goes he sees her pretty face. And when one day he meets a girl so similar to her, he begins to transform her into the lovely woman from his memories.I must say that James Stewart has always been a great actor, but in the movies directed by Hitchcock he rose to a level of pure genius. The way he portrays an aging detective, who is entangled with love and then, unexpectedly, struck with grief, is unforgettable and very convincing. I love the passion in his eyes, the way he is able to show the fear of heights represented by sudden seizures. Even though I'm not a big Kim Novak fan I think that she did a good job playing this possessed woman, trapped in the past, with a dark mystery hidden behind all of her actions.Vertigo is also a groundbreaking achievement in the sense of camera use and visual effects. The impression of falling given by the spiraling out-of-control movements of the cameras in the memorable tower scene produces a thrilling experience. I could only imagine how shocking it must have been in those times. A true masterpiece in cinematography, no doubt about it.Hitchcock was always able to astound the viewers with omnipresent suspense, fantastic plots, marvelous actors and this particular style that no one was ever able to copy. I must say that Hitchcock is one of the reasons for my fascination with the film world and Vertigo has always been the picture that, for me, defined the highest peak in his career.",Vertigo
299,mgruebel,Hitchcock in top form,9,5 January 2015,"Jimmy Stewart plays Scottie Ferguson, a police detective who cannot abide heights. An old school acquaintance exploits Stewart's weakness to make his wife's murder look like a suicide. These are perfect ingredients for a mystery-thriller. The film seems to reach an ending of sorts when the crime is committed. Stewart is sent to a sanatorium because of his double guilt: falling in love with the beautiful Madeleine (Kim Novak), another man's wife; and not being able to rescue her when she climbs a high tower to jump to her death. He just can't get (it) up to follow her to the apex - classic Hitchcock sexual imagery. Adultery coupled with inability to consummate is a miserable combination.Just when you think it's all over, the film really gets going. As is often the case in Hitchcock's thrillers, the real fun is not in the crime, but in unraveling the mastermind's evil plot. Think about ""Dial M for Murder,"" or ""Rear Window,"" another Stewart vehicle.While detective Scottie Ferguson strolls along the streets of San Francisco, having recovered from the sanatorium, he sees - Madeleine!She turns out just to be a sales girl who resembles his dead flame. Or is that all? As Ferguson slowly remakes the sales girl in the image of Madeleine, the resemblance is just too uncanny. Finally a small mistake gives her away. It becomes clear that this girl IS Ferguson's Madeleine whom he loved, and that his school friend's real wife was the one dropped from the tower on that fateful day. When Ferguson insists on revisiting the crime scene, he inadvertently drives the impersonator who has come to love him to her real death atop the very same tower.Hitchcock leaves it open whether the impostor's death finally frees Ferguson not just from his guilt complex, but also from his inability to have an intimate relationship. He certainly was no longer in love with the impostor when he realized the truth. And his patient girlfriend Midge, who nursed him through the sanatorium for months (played by Barbara Bel Geddes to great effect) is still there, waiting...Midge is really the only good person in this morality play, really better than what Ferguson deserves. This is the reason Hitchcock cast the more ambiguous, sometimes whiny Stewart in the role, as opposed to a Cooper, Peck, or Grant. Hitchock plays all the drama to the max, assisted by the usual excellent Hermann score. The Edith Head costumes play a pivotal role in distinguishing the Madeleine-sales girl identities. Even the rear projection is fun to watch, as one can divine when Hitchcock thought a scene important enough to leave the safety of the studio. A 9/10 from the era when people still took Freud seriously, and suspenseful fun to watch even in the era when Freud is exposed as, well, let's just say someone who selectively analyzed his data. Just like Scottie Ferguson in this film.",Vertigo
300,csm-78119,A haunting classic,10,29 January 2019,A superb film cleverly plotted that stands the test of multiple viewings.

301,daniellawson-14-787057,Not Hitchcock's best,6,22 May 2020,"POSITIVES:1) James Stewart is fantastically cool as always in the lead role, at least for the first half of the film
2) I was genuinely shocked when Madeleine 'killed herself' and then shocked again by the twist that it had been a body double the entire time
3) The mystery is certainly intriguing, but that element of the film falls away in the second half
4) It's refreshing to see the way classic films were shot with lots of long takes and barely any editingNEGATIVES:1) The film is far too long. It should only be 90 minutes. The pacing is so incredibly slow and really drags on. Doesn't keep you engaged anywhere near as much as the better and more refined Hitchcock films such as Rear Window
2) I'm not sure at what point we're meant to think that James Stewart realises that Judy is actually Madeleine, but the fact that he forces Judy to change her hair and her clothes so that she looks like Madeleine and even says to her ""your appearance can't matter to you"" is so creepy
3) None of the romantic dialogue works for me. It's so cringey and old fashioned it honestly reminded me of the Anakin and Padme romance dialogue from the Star Wars prequels
4) Madeleine / Judy dies by being scared by a nun and dramatically falling backwards off the top of the church tower for no apparent reason??",Vertigo
302,krycek19,"Hitchcocks most boring among his ""classics""",1,19 February 2016,"I love North by Northwest, Birds and Psycho.But Vertigo is too long and too boring.The story in it self is interesting enough but it should have been at least half an hour shorter. Especially because the ending (Judy and the Madeleine is the same person) is obvious from the moment he knocks on her door. Also why would they pull off a staged suicide that well and she would be dumb enough to stay in the city in the exact same room? Why didn't they just made it seem like the wife was murdered and frame John for the murder? How can John just leave a place where he's been committed? And most importantly: why did Hitchcock insist on using crappy studio shots for almost every outdoor location, whenever the actors were talking?? This actually annoyed me so much that I had a hard time concentrating on enjoying the movie!! Even in 1958 those awful background matte paintings must have looked so fake. Or the scene in the forest or by the ocean or the bay where it's all studio shots!! Or the night painting of the city in Midges apartment!! Or every shot of an actor driving with a fake background in the rear window.It seems profoundly stupid, when they had already shot a lot outside!! I just don't get why???",Vertigo

304,dkncd,A very apt pupil,9,1 November 2007,"Perhaps the best word to describe Alfred Hitchcock's ""Vertigo"" is ""bizarre"". The film even gives this impression with the twisting imagery and hypnotic music of its title sequence. Next, John Ferguson is introduced as a detective that retires due to his inexorable fear of heights. An old friend of John's contacts him and asks him to investigate his wife's strange behavior, which he explains is a result of supernatural forces. John is skeptical and reluctant, but quickly takes the case and begins to observe a bizarre chain of events.James Stewart plays the role John Ferguson and is effective at portraying the transition from impartial investigator to an increasingly involved and even unnerving one. Kim Novak is also excellent as the enigmatic and sporadic Madeleine Elster. Barbara Bel Geddes is also memorable as Midge, particularly in the ""painting"" scene.Most of the story doesn't rely on direct plot twists, but rather a methodical investigation of the mystery presented near the film's beginning and the interesting and peculiar behavior of the subject under investigation. The film is well-made such that it doesn't tip its hand early as to the solution to the mystery, but when the film's major twist does come it is brilliant. This methodical approach is effective, although personally I preferred other Hitchcock films that featured more twists over this one. The film's bizarre quality is developed with the help of eerie music and unorthodox effects sequences, including an interesting effect to represent John's fear of heights.",Vertigo
305,arthera09,everything one would expect from Hitchcock,9,23 February 2008,"The only reason I do not give this movie a 10 is kind of the same reason why I did not give the graduate a 10. It is because the love story felt totally uninspired. Maybe they also kissed differently back then, but when Scotty kisses Judy when she dresses up like Madaline again it does not seem very passionate. Other than that the movie was amazing. I don't think I have seen the lighting trick in any other movie used as effectively as in this movie. When Scotty is learning about the history of Carlotta and the scene just gets dark is a great scene. Somehow the story seems like a standard affair in terms of plots for modern movies, but Hitchcock manages to make it an edge of your seat thriller. Jimmy Stewart did an amazing job as allows and the end it seems as if he just may have it in him to kill Judy. He manages to shed his nice guy persona and is downright scary. There is nothing better than watching a classic film and seeing where the greats get their motivation for making great movies. I have to say that I did love the dream sequence and the look in his face is possibly one of the best reaction shots to a dream. I do not know why movies are just not better written now a days. There was some quick dialog that you do not get in movies like this. It is hard to imagine not falling in love the type of characters that Jimmy Stewart portrays because they just don't make actors like him anymore. If you gave him the lines all you needed to do was put a camera on him. I also liked how they did not show what happened after Judy killed herself because I would like to think of him falling back into despair, but the fact that it is left up to the viewer shows a level of respect to the viewer that one does not see anymore. Jimmy Stewarts up and downs in the movie could not have been done better and seeing him in his most pathetic is really a testament of how good of an actor he is. Overall great movie and it is great to watch the masters at work doing what they do best.",Vertigo
306,ohlabtechguy,Dull and nonsensical!,6,26 March 2007,"Just saw the ""restored"" version of ""Vertigo"" on video. Had never seen the movie before. First half was exceedingly dull as Jimmy the sleuth followed Kim on her aimless journeys. The pace and excitement picked up steam when Kim seemingly threw herself out of the missionary bell tower. But as the mystery unfolded, the plot and especially the ending scene where Kim falls again become so far fetched as to leave the viewer feeling like they had just experienced two HUGELY wasted hours. And Jimmy falling in love with Kim shortly after meeting her is both unethical and unbelievable. Afterall, he was hired by HER husband to follow her. And then he wastes no time making out with her and becoming obsessed with her after only a few short days. Totally UNREAL, especially for Jimmy who, as a star, is traditionally a thoroughly likable guy.The restoration effort turned out a beautiful product, full of color and clarity, and the movie serves as a wonderful historic insight into 1958 San Francisco, but other than that, this movie has to be one of Alfred's worst. Entertainment value is ZERO.OK...After reading some glowing reviews from other commentors, I just had to add a few more criticisms. Firstly, the scene where Jimmy falls off the step stool into Barb's arms is so MELODRAMATIC, namely Jimmy's facial expression, that it was laughable. Alfred should have seen how UNREAL and overdone Jimmy's expression was and changed it. I didn't buy it for a second.Secondly, though I like Jimmy Stewart, I found him unlikeable in this part. I cannot get past his UNETHICAL, UNPROFESSIONAL involvement with his friend's wife whom he has been PAID to follow. It's INEXCUSEABLE! And I'm a liberal minded person. Thirdly, Jimmy looked at least 25 years older than Kim. I find older men lusting after the young and beautiful to be both unsavory and undignified. Fourthly, Jimmy, though he's certainly old enough to be wise and experienced, was playing a stupid character who makes a lot of stupid mistakes. Kim, on the other hand, is practically a lifeless prop and a mere backdrop for Jimmy's inherent stupidity.Final assessment - There are no likable characters in this movie. The real Kim comes across as pathetic in her need to feel love at any cost and Jimmy is downright unlikeable. He's just dumb. Thus, no real sympathy is created for either character. My question becomes: HOW did any respectable and professional movie reviewer such as Ebert miss all this????",Vertigo
307,deacon_blues-3,"Compelling, haunting masterpiece",10,18 March 2013,"Vertigo affected me so strongly the first time I saw it. I was absolutely mesmerized with it and obsessed with Kim Novak (I was perhaps 11 or 12 at the time). It is the first film that really affected me like that, and it hasn't lost any of its power since. I think the real genius of this film is that Hitchcock is able to draw you in so completely to Scottie Ferguson's obsession with Madeline Elster. You are right their with him: you feel his initial fascination, his attraction building toward obsession, the full tragedy of his loss, and then the shock of his seeing Judy Barton for the first time and his obsession with making her over into Madeline, then the devastation of the final climactic scene! Hitch masterfully combined the everyman qualities of Stewart with the exotic magnetism of Novak. Once he had the two of them on set together, all he had to do was mine the abundant gold nuggets that just kept coming from those two.This film leaves me breathless and craving more every time I see it.",Vertigo
308,Vampenguin,Possibly the most overrated movie ever made,6,12 June 2006,"You know what I think? I think everyone who has seen this film only remembers the ending. After a certain turning point near the end of the film, it lives up to it's reputation in every way. Up until then, it's a poorly paced, criminally overrated film.They call Hitchcock the ""Master of Suspense"". Sure he has earned the title, and films like Psycho, Frenzy or Rear Window are proof. Well, I don't know what happened but he was sure missing that gift in '58. Most of the film falls flat, and the first hour and a half or so, with a couple rare exceptions, drags on at a snails pace.The actors were good for the most part. Stewart gives a great performance from beginning to end, while Novak does her best work after the turning point. She seemed to be asleep for most of the first hour and a half. The supporting cast isn't awful, but not nearly as good as I would have expected.Now, there must be some reason why people hail this as Hitchcock's masterpiece? Of course there is: The ending. I wont ruin it for any of you who haven't forced yourselves to sit through this, but the ending is incredible. A couple good twists followed by a huge shocker, this is what people remember about the film.This is all-in-all a pretty lackluster film.

314,C22Man,Just Might be Hitchcock's Best,9,13 July 2016,"Vertigo might very well be Hitchcock's magnum opus. The film that tops a list of so many greats. His most personal and haunting piece. It stands out in his filmography because of that. It demands repeated viewings. It has to be questioned and reflected upon. It is Hitchcock's most thought-provoking and complex film in that regard, one that stays with you long after it is over. I'm delighted that after being dismissed when it was first released that the film is now rightfully considered one of the greatest of its kind.It revolves around Scottie, a former detective crippled by acrophobia, lured out of early retirement to help an old friend named Gavin Elster. Elster asks Scottie to follow his wife Madeleine, whose strange behaviour he believes is the result of being possessed. To say much more about the plot line would ruin some amazing twists that have to be discovered with fresh eyes. It truly one of the most well thought- out and detailed narratives of all time. One that cannot be second guessed and leads to situations that are impossible to see coming. This is where the repeated viewings come in too. Seeing the film for a second time opens up entirely new perspectives. Something that might not have appeared fully realised before now makes perfect sense. It gives the film immense replay value. The film moves slowly in exactly the right way, building everything up with delicacy and secrecy instead of rushing to the payoff. It relies on atmosphere more than any other Hitchcock film. The almost dreamlike quality conveyed by the camera-work. Our sense of uncertainly increasing along with Scottie's, as he begins to feel some kind of connection to the woman he's following. The initial payoff is put together so well that everything falls into position perfectly. The first two thirds of the film unravel beautifully because of this and the mystery remains totally gripping. We are as intrigued by the mystery as our main character. We are kept in the dark during these scenes and discover information as he does (a technique Hitchcock used frequently). Both James Stewart and Kim Novak deserve massive acclaim for their intricate and detailed performances. Stewart plays against his usual role as the charming everyman, making Scottie gentle but increasing edgy and cautious. A man troubled by his ailment and past failures. Stewart portrays the emotional turmoil beneath the character with such subtlety that we can't help but feel for him. Novak is his equal. Her uneasy acting style fitting such an uneasy character. She's an actress that can convey so much using just her eyes and that is always an impressive feat. Novak is hauntingly beautiful, a crucial detail given with have to believe that Scottie grows to obsess over her. Barbara Bel Geddes deserves credit too for bringing some needed levity as Scottie's friend Midge. The third act is where the film really hits home for me and reaches its pinnacle. Without spoiling anything, the way in which everything comes full circle is done masterfully. It is also here where the film delivers on some really powerful themes such as loss, guilt and obsession. All of these are handled with grace and intelligence, joined to the struggles of our main characters. The emotional connection to the story and empathy we feel for the characters exceeds any expectation, making the films twists and turns all the more impactful. This is a very moving film, something that we very rarely associate with Hitchcock. Yet this is undoubtedly his darkest and most psychological film, deliberately devoid of the wit that usually runs through his work. It delves deep into the psyche of Scottie and all the twisted thoughts and feelings that come with it. Another stand-out is the score. Bernard Herrmann's score is simply magnificent, easily one of the greatest of all time. It is both elegant and eerie, invoking both unease and uncertainty, tying itself to the film masterfully. It makes every scene seem grander or chilling depending on what it calls for. It does everything you could want it to and more. Adding to that is Hitchcock genius camera-work. Every camera movement feels as if it was done for a reason. It helps us feels the uncertainty with Stewart as he sneaks through San Francisco, putting the characters fears into a visual sense. It frequently swirls stunningly in time with the music. It lights the characters to represent their true feelings. The direction is some of the most accomplished you will see. Backing this up are the brilliant title sequence by Saul Bass and the truly unsettling dream sequence, both being great touches that add to the films allure.Vertigo succeeds because it is a film that stays with you. Not just for its plot, acting, visuals and music, but for how it evolves each time you see it. All the pieces of the puzzle are being put into place and you won't be able to connect all of them the first time you see it. Once you do, you realise just how superbly constructed the film is. How this ghostly mystery is simply one piece that leads to something even more affecting. It is undoubtedly one of Hitchcock's best, whether or not it is first on that list simply depends on personal preference. It is a haunting, elegant, frequently surprising and almost dreamlike piece. Its power continues to grow over time.",Vertigo

317,schroederagustavo,Such a good film!,8,18 January 2020,"So, Vertigo is widely considered as one of the greatest films ever made and probably in Hitchock's top 3. I would not disagree with the latter statement. Vertigo is an outstanding piece of filmmaking, everything from the acting, the direction, cinematography and writing is really great in almost every way. Some of my favorite movie shots of all time are in this movie. The shot where Kim Novak is at the San Francisco Bay with the bridge over her, the shot when her and Jimmy Stewart kiss for the first time, all really cool stuff. This movie also has a lot of things that I guess could be considered to be ""borderline experimental"" as Jay Bauman would call it, specifically referring to Jimmy Stewart's dream sequence and the opening credits. The score by Bernard Hermann is also incredible.The mystery behind it all is really cool where in the beginning you don't really know if there's a supernatural aspect about it or not, it's really great. There's not a whole lot of new things to say about Vertigo, but I will say my honest opinion on a certain aspect of the film, which is actually one of the most important aspects, that I'm not in love with. And I know this opinion is highly controversial and this is even the second time I watch this movie to make sure that what I'm about to write is really what I think. In my opinion, the romance between Jimmy Stewart and Kim Novak is really forced, it feels like it came out of nowhere. So Jimmy Stewart's character follows Kim Novak around and suddenly he becomes obsessed with her and at first it's not really clear if he's obsessed with figuring out the truth or if he's actually obsessed with her. And from the moment he rescues her from the bay, he acts really creepy towards her and for some reason, within like a day or two since they met, they ""fall in love"". To accept their love is so important to the overall structure of the second half of the film, that all that happens is just not as believable as I would have liked, unfortunately.I still really like the movie, it's a classic, like I said, I mentioned all of the good aspects about it. However, it just feels to me like the film could have actually benefited from additional runtime to flesh out the relationship between Stewart and Novak a bit more. Still a classic, regardless of some guy's opinion on the internet, and I would still highly recommend it.",Vertigo

I loved its suspense, moving performances, haunting love story, dreamlike quality, and poignant yet powerful Bernard Herrmann score -- so why did it take me years to embrace VERTIGO as wholeheartedly as our beleaguered hero John ""Scottie"" Ferguson embraces his beloved Madeleine Elster? James Stewart plays Scottie, a former police detective who finds out the hard way that he has acrophobia (fear of heights, to us laypeople) when he can't save a patrolman from falling to his death during a rooftop chase. Since VERTIGO is a Hitchcock movie, what better place for our hero to live and wrestle with his phobia than San Francisco? While working on a cantilever bra invented by an engineer (nice work if you can get it!), Scottie's gal pal, designer Midge Wood (wry scene-stealer Barbara Bel Geddes) tries to help him overcome his fear gradually with stepladders (""I look up, I look down...""). Too bad the ladders happen to be next to Midge's high-rise apartment's window. Poor guy, it's always something! Scottie's old college chum Gavin Elster (suave Tom Helmore) offers him a private investigator job tailing his lovely but troubled young wife, Madeleine (Kim Novak in her finest and most challenging performance). Seems that Madeleine -- one of the coolest and most elegant of the director's legendary ""Hitchcock blondes"" -- thinks she's possessed by the spirit of her late great-grandmother Carlotta Valdes, and is behaving accordingly. Scottie tails Madeleine all over San Francisco to the places where the tragic Carlotta lived, loved, and went mad after her sugar daddy ""threw her away"" and kept their love child. Our detective finally comes face to face with his quarry after saving her when she jumps into the bay in one of her fugue states.As the song says, the hunter is captured by the game. Soon Scottie and Madeleine are mad for each other -- but it seems poor troubled Madeleine is also mad in a less romantic way. When she confides in Scottie about her recurring morbid dreams about the Mission at San Juan Bautista, Scottie brings her there in hopes of curing her obsession. Bad move, Scottie -- Madeleine bolts to the bell tower. Scottie gives chase, but his vertigo paralyzes him halfway up the stairs (great spatial F/X here). He hears a woman screaming, sees a body fall past the window...and his beloved Madeleine is no more.Or is she? After he recovers from a grief-induced nervous breakdown, Scottie spies shopgirl Judy Barton (the versatile Novak again). Except for her red hair and somewhat tacky fashion sense, Judy's a dead ringer for Madeleine! As their relationship grows, so does audience apprehension as Scottie obsessively tries to give Judy the ultimate makeover, recreating his lost love. (Where's the WHAT NOT TO WEAR crew when you need them? :-)) Judy's a quick study -- because she's really Madeleine! See, Judy was Elster's mistress, and he coached her to look and act like the real Madeleine Elster as part of a murder plot. 'Twas the real Mrs. Elster who died at the mission that day, and Elster's real purpose for poor Scottie was to witness the ""suicide."" Since Judy truly loves Scottie, has all the self-esteem of a squashed grape, and doesn't want to spill the murder plot, she's willing to play Eliza Doolittle to Scottie's macabre Henry Higgins. But the jig is up when, post-makeover, Judy wears a necklace Scottie recognizes as part of Madeleine's Carlotta Valdes collection. Furious at being played for a sucker, he takes Judy to the mission tower and forces her to confess. A black shape looms. Guilt-ridden Judy is so spooked by what turns out to be a curious nun (Judy must've gone to one of those tough parochial schools) that she loses her balance and falls...and a shattered Scottie loses his Madeleine a second, final time, looking like he wants to join her.When I first saw VERTIGO in my college years during its 1980s re-release, I thought it was well worth seeing, but Scottie's necrophilic mania to recreate Judy as Madeleine really upset me. I found myself rooting for, angry at, and sorry for Scottie and Judy all at once. Stewart's portrayal of a man obsessed is tragic and unnerving; Hitchcock really knew how to tap into his leading man's dark side. As if the ghoulishness of Scottie's romantic obsession and the malleable Judy's heartbreaking lack of self-esteem weren't frustrating enough, even the department store salespeople and salon personnel in the film go along with Scottie's demands (""The gentleman certainly seems to know what he wants."") despite Judy's anguished protests. My husband Vinnie aptly noted that everyone on screen acted like Scottie was having a dog groomed.On my first time around, it seemed to me that Hitchcock gave away the mystery's solution too soon, making the rest of the film anticlimactic. But my appreciation for VERTIGO grew over the years as I matured and learned more about life, people, and emotions. By the time we saw the beautifully restored version of VERTIGO at NYC's Ziegfeld Theatre in 1996, Judy's revelatory letter touched my heart and added to the suspense of waiting for the other shoe to drop for Scottie. There's no question that VERTIGO has long since become one of my favorite Hitchcock films!",Vertigo
319,Dodger-9,All time high for Hitch,9,20 January 2001,"An ex-detective with a fear of heights is hired to follow the wife of an old friend who fears she may try to commit suicide. Sounds simple enough on paper but this is one of the most intriguing of Alfred Hitchcock's movies, not least because of our leading man's obsession.James Stewart gives perhaps his most intense performance and Kim Novak is very good as the obligatory icy blonde. The moment when a ghostly Novak emerges from the bathroom is one of the most haunting in screen history. An influential film for many of today's top directors, it inspired Basic Instinct, Batman and The Crying Game, not to mention 12 Monkeys which featured a clip in the movie itself.",Vertigo
320,Arkaan,Bizzare,10,2 August 1999,"Thats the first word that comes to mind after seeing this film.  It is a ghost story, a character study, and a thriller all in one.  This is one of Hitchcock's films that requires more than one viewing.  You miss so much the first time, that you need to see it a second.  This is one of Hitchcock's best, and his best colour film. Bernard Hermann has received a lot of justified praise for his score.  It is mesmerizing and beautiful.  It stands alone, yet works stunningly in the film.  The cinematography is also great. The zoom-in, dolly out shots are particularily well done. This was James Stewart's most unusual role, yet he gives an admirable performance.",Vertigo
321,macpet49-1,Visual Stunner Stifled by an Old Fart Actor,8,25 February 2017,"I have only one question--why is James Stewart still single at the obvious age of 50+ and why is tethered to an old college ex-girlfriend? Hitch used to say ""let the audience worry about how Stewart gets down from the roof"" but we still worry as to why a very old (esp. in the 1950s) man is obsessed with a young woman who could almost be his granddaughter? And why is he contentedly living alone in San Fran. on the cusp of the gay revolution? His final fantasy is remaking Kim Novak over like his own Barbie just to be able to stomach looking at her in the end. I'd say this is a classic closeted gay man using an ex- girlfriend as a beard while he plays couturier to his doll (Recall Clifton Webb in 'Laura'?) and then bored with her tosses her off the roof (typical teenage boy stuff). It's sad that with a younger lead man and more sex appeal this could've been a great psychological drama!",Vertigo
322,wjfickling,Just misses being a masterpiece,9,10 June 2004,"I know that many people consider this Hitchcock's masterpiece, and some consider it the greatest film of all time.  True, it has many elements of a masterpiece.  It is a major mood piece.  The sad, elegaic melancholy is sustained throughout, thanks largely to Bernard Hermann's score.  The acting is first rate, even by Novak.  The color is masterful.  All this having been said, why then do I say that this just misses being a masterpiece.  Because, to me, the film has a serious flaw which mars the film, although it doesn't destroy it.  The flaw occurs in the scene that occurs about halfway through the film, after Madeline has been dead for a year, when Scotty meets Judy Barton, also played by Novak.  After Scotty brings her back to her hotel room and says goodnight, Judy begins an internal monologue, accompanied by a visual flashback, that gives away the whole plot.  After this, there is no more suspense!  The viewer knows something that Scotty doesn't.  Wouldn't it have been far better for the viewer to have been kept in suspense as well and find out the truth at the same time Scotty does.  If you don't believe me, watch the film again and fast forward past this scene, and see if it isn't an improvement.  Otherwise, a masterpiece.  9/10",Vertigo
323,douglasmcbroom,Color It Dull,5,28 March 2021,"Hitchcock himself said he miscast both of his leads: Novak (lacking the chops) and Stewart (too old). He was absolutely correct about Novak, who delivers a wooden performance for the ages. Hitchcock liked to use the word ""stillborn"" for a film that didn't work and it certainly applies to Novak's performance. As for Stewart, why is an older man not allowed to lust for a younger woman? Stewart is one of our all-time best and he is at the top of his game here. Barbara Bel Gedes is terrific as 'Midge.' But neither the actors nor Hitchcock, can overcome this overly-long, overly-wrought screenplay. And absolutely nothing can overcome the absurdly overly-dramatic score. The score alone could sink this film. Early in the film Stewart's character makes a face at the music playing in Midge's apartment; he was on to something. I recognize that this is an important film, which might explain the critics near universal love for it (although, note Variety's dissenting original review), in terms of the use of lighting and color, and for its invention of the 'trombone' effect to create the feelings of vertigo. But that is film school stuff, not movie audience entertainment. So teach it reverently in school, but watch it critically and with lots of snacks. Hitchcock always said his most important critic-his wife Alma-hated this film. She had a point.",Vertigo

Style and suspense galore, yet, what could've been an A+ finish gets a grade F in using the absurd to revert to stock Hitchcock horror and derail what was building to a satisfying close, an emotion Al understood (The-Lady-Vanishes Suspicion). But memorable is Novak's break from blonde bombshell in favor of beguiling brunette which suited her and viewers just fine (2.5/4).SPOILER ALERT for the Vertigo ending that SHOULD'VE been: At the top of the bell tower, Scottie and Judy are reconciled yet emotionally drained when suddenly from the shadows approach two nuns to startle the couple, causing Judy to slip and nearly fall to her death but is pulled back to safety by Scottie. Still stunned, they lovingly embrace in a warm kiss, the nuns signing the cross, not for the smooch but the Devil who flies by in a cold chill, and the couple sigh in nervous laughter while we smile and thank God for sentiment and skillful writing.",Vertigo
325,domtaylor,"A masterpiece that still holds up today, despite a few flaws.",9,12 July 2018,"Despite being 60 years old, Alfred Hitchcock's 'Vertigo' still holds up today. Its breathtaking use of colour and camera work to tell the story is excellently anchored by Bernard Herrman's majestic score and some masterful performances by James Stewart and Kim Novak. The film perfectly conveys the theme of voyeurism, thanks to Hitchcock's amazing use of the shot-reverse-shot structure and eye-line matches, to place us inside the head of Scottie, who we begin to discover may not be the person whom we should be rooting for. The themes that 'Vertigo' explore are definitely ahead of their time, and it is confounding that Hitchcock actually managed to sneak them into this studio film. The story takes some genuinely unexpected turns and Hitchcock cleverly allows the audience to be one-step ahead of the characters, in order to create tension and excitement. Although the film does include some heavy exposition, Hitchcock's use of visual storytelling (especially in the first act) makes up for it, and this makes the film require much more thought than many from its time. My main issue with the film is its somewhat quick conclusion. A little more time to digest what is happening would have made the ending more satisfying. Still, 'Vertigo' is definitely a great film and, in my opinion, Hitchcock's best. 8/10",Vertigo
326,roddekker,"Alfred Hitchcock's Pre-""Psycho"" Psycho",4,23 May 2015,"Vertigo has got to be one of the most absurd and disturbing movies about men and their ""modern-day"" mental illnesses that I have ever seen. It's true.The mental illness that I'm talking about here is, of course - Men's totally twisted and fanatical obsession about having complete and absolute control over women.You know, I'd say that when it comes to one of Hitchcock's most psychotic ""movie-psychos"" of all-time - Scottie Ferguson here in Vertigo makes Norman Bates from Psycho look, by comparison, as if he were ""normal"", yes, NORMAL. I mean, Scottie was one really whacked-out maniac, that's for sure! Personally, I think that director Alfred Hitchcock went way too far out on a shaky limb with this one. And, being way out there, he ended up losing his balance and, literally, getting ""vertigo"", himself. This film is nothing but a bird's eye view of a supremely grotesque freak show with Scottie (representing the average American psycho, I mean, the average American male) as the main monster of attraction.At a running time of 130 minutes, Vertigo really only begins to pick up steam in the last 30 minutes. The first 100 minutes of it is just endlessly drawn out 'build-up', extremely drab, most of it.",Vertigo

Bernard Herrmann's hypnotic score crowns the experience.",Vertigo
328,Richard_Alex_Jenkins,What A Film,9,8 April 2013,"I still need to go through Hitchcock's entire back catalogue, but this is the best film I've seen by the director so far. From the great acting and dialogue, terrific rooftop visuals and the combination of beautiful, suspenseful music. I enjoyed the mesmeric views of San Francisco during the 1950s and the beautiful saloon cars with white wall tyres and blazing logos.The pace of the film unfolds quite cleverly. One minute the husband is asking the detective for help, neatly followed by a refusal, the next moment the detective is already working undercover, no need for acceptance speeches or excessive justifications. It's simply masterful scriptwriting flow.After 30 minutes running time I still had no real idea what the film was about, not that it made a jot of difference, followed by Hitchcock's knack of revealing practically everything all at once so that we don't get too bogged down. The scene being set once again for the next, even more mysterious part.The film does dip in pace a little during the mid section, but picks up again after a major incident, surprising us with surreal dreaming sequences, intertwining monochrome colours with bizarre and rather spooky effects.The film scores on so many levels that it left me be a little overwhelmed. It could be regarded as a story of longing or unrequited love, of madness and schizophrenic flashbacks, or a straightforward detective based mystery thriller, depending on how you look at it. The film is more thought provoking than any other Hitchcock film I've seen so far, I had to pause to consider the manner in which the plot had turned and why the situation had arrived at that particular point.It's a very intimate, almost creepy film in places about love, obsession, deceit and betrayal with pre-psychedelic overtones. I thought the switches between time and space were simply fantastical, with the twists and turns adding layer upon layer of intrigue, never getting old nor giving too much.After the underwhelming disappointment (for me) of James Stewart in 'Rear Window', this was a massive hit, putting Hitchcock firmly back on the historical 'best of' film map.",Vertigo
329,kylehodgdon,Bit Of A Let Down,6,11 November 2009,"I was a bit let down by ""Vertigo"". I watched it for the first time just recently and with all the great things I had been hearing about it for years and years, I was expecting something truly monumental. Even if I did not have such high hopes, I don't feel as though I would have been overly impressed, as I feel a ""pretty good"" rating is spot on.It felt to me that everything was just too convenient to drive the story along. I mean, had Scottie not reacted exactly as Gavin and Madeline had anticipated, everything would have unraveled and fallen apart. This story just asks the audience to stretch reality to give them the benefit of the doubt one too many times. Later on, when Scottie finds Judy and falls in love with her again, it all felt so clunky. I'm not sure if he knew all along that it was or was not Madeline, but either way, the chemistry between the two characters left me scratching my head. The end with the nun felt all too random as well. My interpretation is that a thing of good had come to face Judy and Judy could not bear the wrongs she had committed, so she allowed herself to fall. It feels like a cheap ending. They might have just had Scottie wake up and said, ""it was all a dream.""",Vertigo
330,susansweb,A movie that demands repeat viewing,10,27 August 2002,"In the fifties, Jimmy Stewart made some movies that portrayed him in a not very flattering light.  The man that we saw normally playing the bumbling, shy yet great guy was now selfish, vindictive and had lost all faith in humanity.  These were great movies and his Scottie in ""Vertigo"" is one of the better examples of this.  Alfred Hitchcock weaves a tale that after watching makes the viewer feel uncomfortable with their feelings.  For we identify with Scottie and understand what he does and why we might have done it as well.  This is why I think another viewing would be beneficial because knowing all the secrets allows the viewer to watch the movie from a more objective point of view and see how twisted someone can become.",Vertigo

332,Don-102,A Visual Work of Art That Must be Seen on the BIG Screen...,10,31 May 1999,"Alfred Hitchcock's VERTIGO has always been able to connect over the years, whether on TV or the restored video version.  To really appreciate this incredible flick from the Master of Suspense, you MUST see it on the big screen in 70mm.  Check the papers for revival houses in your area where old films from Hollywood's ""Golden Age"" can truly be revered.  The opening title sequence, one of the best in cinema history created by the immortal Saul Bass (NORTH BY NORTHWEST, CAPE FEAR), seemed entirely new to me in the darkened theatre.  Hitch made his most artistic picture with wondrous color schemes and amazing screen composition.  Just look at the ghostly greens and reds that help this complex tale absorb you and engage you.  Kim Novak's character is absolutely ""from amongst the dead"" in the mind of Jimmy Stewart (in his second best role) and the lengths that he and Hitchcock go to are exhausting and mystifying.Most film buffs know that VERTIGO is considered Hitch's most personal film, mostly because of how he molds his actresses to look perfect much like the Stewart character does with Novak. The two actors have fantastic chemistry that changes drastically from initial obsession, to love, then back to obsession.  Not much happens in terms of pure action, but as pure cinema, this movie is a landmark.  I can't remember a film that can be so visually captivating without a word of dialogue for long stretches of time.  The viewer becomes just as obsessed with ""Madeleine"", played sensually by Novak. It really is hard to figure out if there are some supernatural undertones at work, especially in the world of Hitchcock.Bernard Herrman's legendary score sounds crisp and emotional in its new, restored form and is as much a character in the film as the colors and the flowers and the hair twists that come to mean so much as the film progresses.  The ""special sequence"", or nightmare that Stewart has is VERTIGO's crowning achievement.  The animation and coloring must have awed audiences of 1958, who actually did not accept the movie at the time. Time has done wonders to VERTIGO and the people at Universal who painstakingly put the film back together for theatrical release have done an amazing job. I only hope the rumors regarding a restoration of REAR WINDOW are true. Look for it in late 1999 !?RATING: 10 of 10 NOTE: Stewart's best performance was in the great MR.

333,PassPopcorn,Pass the Popcorn review,7,16 March 2013,"Alfred Hitchcock - the name says it all. This prolific and famous director doesn't really need any introduction/presentation, and neither do his movies - many of them can often be found on various ""best movies"" lists and maintain a cult status even after all these years.Detective John Ferguson (James Stewart) decides to retire after his acrophobia causes the accidental death of a police officer. He meets an old friend, Gavin (Tom Helmore), who asks him to follow his wife Madeleine (Kim Novak), because he thinks she's possessed, hence in mortal danger. John is sceptical, but he accepts and, as time passes, starts to develop feelings for Madeleine, all the while trying to get rid of his phobia.Vertigo is now hailed by many as (one of) the best Hitchcock movies, and as (one of) the best ever made. In my opinion, it's pretty overrated. Of course, this doesn't mean it's bad. The story is original, the events are unexpected, and every major dramatic happening is accompanied by a fitting soundtrack. The actors do a terrific job, you can see they are really into the part they play, although the age difference between the two main characters does cause their love to be less believable. Hitchcock himself blamed James Stewart's old age for the movie's critical and commercial failure, when it premiered. Certain scenes are memorable: Vertigo popularized the dolly zoom (thus often called ""the Vertigo effect""), achieved by moving the camera away from a subject while simultaneously zooming in, and used when John Ferguson looks down from a height which makes him feel dizzy. But all of this somehow doesn't work. There is something missing. The movie simply didn't grip me. And of course, there is the ending, which could have been so much better, but instead it almost ruins the whole film. It seems like the director was late for a meeting and decided it all had to end there and then - which results in a rushed, unsatisfying finale. In conclusion: a good but too overrated piece of art which requires that little ""something"" to work out. But maybe then it wouldn't be Hitchcock.Rating: 7/10 Read more at http://passpopcorn.wordpress.com/",Vertigo
334,MrBiddle,Johnny-O,10,11 April 2005,"An example of how much information can be withheld from the audience as the movie progresses and the irony (in literary terms) of letting them know MORE than the protagonist as the story reaches a certain turning point.I saw a clever tool being used when Kim Novak writes the letter of apology and there is a voice over, speaking NOT to the audience but to the person she is writing too in the process letting the audience know too, some information of the plot we didn't have a clue about early on.The dolly/zoom effect is used extnsively in this film and has been used by many imitators and inspired. Namely Spielberg in JAWS, when Roy Scheider gets up from his reclined position.What we get in the end, since we already know everything is NOT surprise but rather, anticipation and a lot of suspense. And finally we get the payoff of those earlier scenes in the film that lasted about an hour or so of the movie - when Scottie finally explodes in the end releasing the hurt of his betrayal.And there is one final twist in the movie, that despite Scottie's character arc of having possibly conquered his acrophobia - displays the irony and recurring area of the plot. It's like poetry, where it rhymes and some stanzas are repeated. And that's cohesion in the world of storytelling to me. You'll see what I mean when you see the film.As usual, Hitchcock has shot the film beautifully with excellent styling and Bernard Hermann's music accentuates the hypnotic thrill and dread; something that contributes even more to the suspense of the movie.A great movie.

335,slabihoud,Let there be color!,10,26 January 2005,"Since there are already so many real good comments on this film I want to focus on only one aspect.Vertigo is a great example for what color films really can look like! Not only do I want to praise the quality of the Technicolor dye transfer prints but also more the way Hitchcock used color to create moods. Many directors used light to create moods in black and white movies but only very few ever got so far as to use the much greater palette of colors for the same purpose. One wonders why. Some directors decide for an overall color look, which is often done in the lab, but not on the set.Vertigo is full of scenes where the colors have been saturated or changed to create a special feeling. Hitchcock even went so far as to openly dye some frames is bright unnatural colors. He played around with colors in all his color films but never as much as in this one. Think for example on James Stewart's nightmare in the middle of the film. There are frames dyed purple and green; the cemetery scenes are red, inserted to the rhythm of the music with normal frames. Kim Novak is often bathed in colored light like in the famous hotel room scene, where she appears like a ghost with all the green light around her.The shading is also important. In the scene in the bookshop we hear a dark and sad story while at the same time the light dimes down to simulate dusk. In the scene where Judy remembers the real events in the bell tower it starts with an outdoor scene, which we have already seen but it is now much darker than the first time. In the sequence where Stewart follows Novak to the cemetery everything feels unnatural since every scene glows through the use of a filter that creates a blur. The non-color of Kim Novak's dress as Madeleine is also a very important aspect in the film. She has to color her hair to become Madeleine again at the end of the picture.The way color is used in this film gives it this dreamlike quality that allows endless interpretations. A true masterpiece!",Vertigo
336,thespeos,Superb Mystery Suspense Film,8,9 June 2021,"The first time you watch this will probably be great. While it moves slowly, there's always something brewing: suspense (of course), romance, mystery, etc. And it's beautifully shot.If you have not yet seen this film - you should, really. It is one of the best mystery stories ever woven, and as Hitchcock does ... it couples primitive behavior with psychological intrigue.Unfortunately, I've probably watched it too many times. Now it feels like it takes forever, the romance seems odd, unrequited love that never gets resolved, and a Jimmy Stewart that just gets ""old"" for me (I think I've seen him in too many movies).STORY: On the surface the story appears bland: some rich white guy's wife is acting strange, etc. (How about the rich white guy act strange?). But this story was built with you (the reader / viewer) in mind as it is not what you think at first. Then again, it's not what you think at second thought.ACTING: Kim Novak plays the ""femme fatale"" here but she shows her range beautifully, which shows how Hollowood abuses and misuses female actors. So ... Jimmy Stewart, John Wayne, Humpty Bogart, blah, blah ... just the same ole crew.TEMPO: Slow, but appropriately so the first time you watch it. It's NOT like ""Psycho"" or ""Frenzy"" that move at a good clip. No, ""Vertigo"" is not Hitchcock's usual pace.CINEMATOGRAPHY: Filmed around San Francisco, CA, it's got great camera work. Of course, Bernard Herrman does the music and it's nicely done. But again, it's NOT creepy like ""Psycho"" at all.DIRECTING: I get the feeling that Hitchcock was taking this one easy, but I don't mean sloppy. He had been cranking out film annually since 1920 at this point, and you can see him slowing down as we reach 1960. He's still on top of his game, but this film was a ""protracted"" version of the master.""Vertigo"" is a bit different than other Hitchcock films, but then again, so are some his other great works: ""I Confess,"" ""The Trouble with Harry,"" and a few others.

337,ed_two_o_nine,a stunning success,10,14 July 2008,"This is a stunning film that really is the product of a master craftsman. Some people complain it is slow but really it is not it is just we are now used to being fed movie of a faster pace full of fast cuts. But what we have here is a fantastic study of Hitchcock's of obsession and misogyny. Where all the characters are given room to breath. It is not good to give away too much of the plot or that can relatively spoil the movie on a first viewing. The film is basically the study of one man John 'Scottie' Ferguson's obsession with one woman. The surrounding plot is really secondary to that (Hitchock's famous McGuffin). James Stewart is on magnificent form here (there really is no modern actor who could play his everyman role so well). The way each and every shot is shaped and crafted here is truly great, and we also get something which you rarely see in films these days, scenes with no little to no dialogue where the image tells the story, and here this is used superbly. From the fantastic Saul Bass opening credits through to the final shot everything here is right. The only week point being Kim Novak who I do not think is that great an actor, but apart from that the only other part of any other size is Barbara Del Geddes who is very good as Madge. We have some almost psychedelic effects shots from Hitchock to add to the deepening sense of paranoia that culminates in a great suspenseful finale.

It feels a bit slow at times and unlike RW does feel a film from it's time. Still, the twisting and turning plot is genuinely engaging, and the twist is a genuine mind bender, although I feel it being revealed at the beginning of the final act is perhaps a misstep (Hitchcock himself wanted to move it to the end after the film was completed as he felt it came too early, and I agree). It is an essential film for thriller fans, but imo at least is not Hitchcock's best.",Vertigo
341,etsm92,"Excellent, raving! The best Hitchcock film EVER!",10,9 December 2005,"Vertigo/1958/****Main Stars: James Stewart Kim NovakAlfred Hitchcock's ""Vertigo"" and ""North by Northwest"" are tied in first place. Followed close by ""Rear Window"" in second place and others in third, fourth and so on The first time I had seen this film was not that long ago and I only saw the second half of the film. The second time I saw it, I was in to it so much, I probably only blinked a half a dozen times. Everyone knows that you blink every six seconds but when I saw this film, I hadn't realized one blink at all! This is a movie I would add to my must-see/recommended list along with ""The Untouchables"" and other classic films. The main star in ""Vertigo"" is John Ferguson (James Stewart) who is afraid of heights (""I have acrophobia which gives me vertigo and I get dizzy"", he says). This is one film where you are let me stress the word required to listen to the dialog. At first I hadn't listened to the dialog and so I was extremely confused. So what you have to do is listen very carefully to get the point (main point) of the movie. In this movie, Ferguson is madly in love with a woman named Madeleine Elster (Kim Novak). If you listen to the dialog in this film, you'll know why John had to go searching for her and to follow her every move. If you didn't listen to the dialog, too bad for you. This film is definitely Hitchcockian because it has drama, some scenes of humor, romance, mystery, suspense, everything you want from a Hitchcock film. One thing I was expecting was the cinematography. Hitchcock always has a great cinematographer to do his films. I think the same cinematographer probably does every one of his films. Alfred is also physically in his films. Not only does he direct, but he also has a cameo in each of his films. Every film of his I try to point out where he is and I always find him because of his distinctive look and his plump body. Of course he's no longer with us anymore because he was born in 1899 and not to many people live to be 106 years old (he would be that age if he was still around). His last film was in 1975 and it was called ""Family Plot"". Now there is a lot to the story of ""Vertigo"" but it's still interesting and easy to catch on to if you are a good listener. Now Madeleine (who's real name is Judy Barton) seems possessed in John Ferguson's eyes but he still loves her. She seems to not know where she is or why she's there when it comes to her great grandmother. Every day she goes to look at her great grandmother's grave and her portrait that hangs in a museum. John Ferguson is required by her ""so-called"" husband (you'll know what I mean when you see it) to follow her and see what she's up to. With John's former occupation of being a detective (now he quit the job and starts to wander), he was called back again by Judy's ""so-called"" husband to watch her. In my eyes, it's like a case that needs to be solved. Madeleine (real name Judy) tries to trick John Ferguson several times by falling in to the San Francisco Bay and others. This wonderful Hitchcock film (to me it is) has the biggest twist (in my opinion) of all his movies and the best one yet! What I mean by ""yet"" is I haven't seen every single one of his films yet but believe me; I will. Movie directed by Alfred Hitchcock.",Vertigo

343,DonaldDooD,The Most Overrated Film of All Time,2,31 July 2014,"Sure, not every film on IMDb's Top 250 is going to stagger me. But at least I can see why those films are respected. Vertigo offers nothing beyond its historical importance. If this film were released today, nobody would care. Instead of being a classic that transcends time, its one of the most dated movies I've seen.The acting and character are as stock as any movie from the era. Nothing separates our lead beyond his paranoia. Worse yet is the romantic relationship between James Stewart and Kim Novak. Cinema snobs love to bash Hollywood blockbusters for their contrived romances, but pretend films like Vertigo are somehow better. They know each other for a day, yet we're supposed to believe Stewart has a romantic obsession after her death? Give me a break. Their passion is as brilliant as a wet paper bag.Vertigo is supposed to be a great psychological thriller. I found myself bored. I can't care about the characters when their relationship is so contrived. And nothing impressed me in terms of audio, cinematography, or plot twists. When Kim Novak is killed in the last minute of the film, me and my friend were laughing - because we didn't care about the character, and had no time to witness anyone's sorrow. It had no point in the narrative. And as the ending to the film, it gave me nothing to take away from it.And I'm not someone who only likes films made after a certain date. But legitimately good films remain relevant decades after their release. The Great Dictator, 12 Angry Men, and The Godfather all hold up. I don't see any of that quality in Vertigo. Some may cite how it was shot, or how it influenced films for years to come, but as a 21st century viewer, Vertigo fails to illicit any emotion. My mind is sufficiently intact.",Vertigo
344,commandercool88,"Disturbing, haunting, and beautiful.",10,7 July 2008,"'Vertigo' has through the years become more highly regarded than it ever was at the time of its release. It is oftentimes referred to as the most important film Hitchcock ever made, his masterpiece. While this assertion is purely in the eye of the beholder, there is a unique quality about 'Vertigo'. It is like a fine wine, fermenting over the years to become a landmark film that will haunt and disturb you.Alfred Hitchcock's 1958 vision proves to be a deeply personal quest to the heart of a man's soul and his elusive search for true love. It's a haunting story of obsession, a painful portrait of loss. The picture dives much deeper than we've ever seen Hitchcock do before, and it doesn't always make for comfortable viewing. The nature of the story itself is troubling and difficult to tackle, and 'Vertigo' stands as a true testament as to what Hitchcock was capable of doing with a camera. A man who could tell a story like few others, and in a way that was entirely his own. He made countless great films, but 'Vertigo' strikes at a core where films rarely go.What is it about 'Vertigo' that makes it such an unsettling picture? There's a lingering eeriness throughout it all, a morbid atmosphere, as it acts simultaneously as a romantic love story and a troubling look at obsession. Everyman Jimmy Stewart delivers a memorable performance and brings to life a character who's own mental state seems in serious question. His journey is our journey, and the film taps into a part of the human psyche rarely approached by cinema, and it causes us to feel vulnerable and uneasy but unquestionably transfixed.The wonderful Kim Novak dives into 'Vertigo' in two starring roles, and the object of Stewart's encroaching affection. Filmed in classic technicolor and with a color pallet made up of sensuous greens and tantalizing reds, it only brings out Novak's striking beauty even more. The eyes are a pathway to the soul, and one glance from Novak is more than enough to capture your attention. It all seems to play into Hitchcock's master plan, whose true intentions are sometimes never quite known. Two fascinating leads, a powerful score, lush colors and textures, haunting landscapes, out-of-body dreamscapes. This is classic Hitchcock, and some of his most profound work.'Vertigo' is hypnotically beautiful, and ultimately tragic. There's a complexity here that's difficult to penetrate, and I believe it's how Hitchcock intended it. There are questions we may have, but Hitchcock forever took those answers with him many years ago. And yet there's something about this film that continues to fascinate audiences today, a beating heart that's allowed it to grow over the years but with Hitchcock's original and haunting vision still intact. 'Vertigo' may not be his definitive masterpiece, but it may just be his most accomplished work.More reviews: rottentomatoes.com/vine/journal_view.php?journalid=219276&view=public",Vertigo
345,TheNabOwnzz,Hitchcock's Magnum Opus; A masterpiece on pathological obsession,10,10 February 2019,"With an incredibly storied career, director Alfred Hitchcock has created many outstanding motion pictures, and while Psycho (1960) is undoubtedly his most iconic and influential, he never quite reached the level of sophistication, narrative prowess & depth that he reached in Vertigo, which is arguably the master's greatest film.It did require a second viewing for me personally to appreciate Vertigo for the work of art that is truly is, and even though it is a bit of a cliché these days, Vertigo is the kind of motion picture that definitely needs to be seen multiple times in order to be judged properly. This is the case because the initial first time viewer will most likely focus on the primary narrative, which consists 'Scottie' Ferguson helping his army buddy Gavin Elster investigate the strange behavior of his wife. This entire narrative already seems to wrap up completely after a little over half of the movie's entire runtime, which will probably leave the initial viewer with feelings of confusion & unsatisfaction. However, one of the greatest aspects of Vertigo is that it has this classic Hitchcock mystery/twisted atmosphere, but also an incredibly deep surreal layer added on top of it, which was quite unique for Hitchcock. Thus, the
'usual' Hitchcock narrative wraps up after a little over an hour, paving the way for the much more personal, surreal and obsession based final hour. When you understand what is going to happen in a second viewing, you could become more focused on Scottie's inner confliction and the way he handles his obsession, making the viewer finally realize the emotional resonance and artistic prowess of the final hour.From one of the greatest opening title sequences to its end, Vertigo is Hitchcock at the absolute top of his game. The title sequence, starting with a shot of the mouth of a woman while moving to her eye, followed by an inside glance of her eye coupled with spiralling imagery, is pretty much an identical piece of storytelling as the coming two hours. In a way, the audience is shown Scottie's future obsession from the viewpoint of the camera itself, making us feel obsessed. From a shot of the mouth of the woman towards the eyes, there are a lot of digital spiralling special effects signifying the loss of self control, making this superb title sequence indeed very reminiscent of what is going to happen afterwards, making it also one of the most creative opening titles ever made.James Stewart is near flawless as the conflicted John 'Scottie' Ferguson, displaying his wide range of acting talents as a morally complex character. Kim Novak's divine beauty as Madeleine speaks for itself, and her characteristic stiffness perfectly emphasizes her character's precarious situation as she is torn between her own identity and the man she loves. The screenplay is also superb, as is the absolutely gorgeous cinematography and production design, which are used as a medium of subtle sub text and subliminal messages.I don't think there's any doubt that Vertigo is Hitchcock's most complex & nuanced film, as Vertigo contains many layers of narrative, character & themes. There are not many themes that do not apply to Vertigo, but the most common one is obviously obsession. Ferguson starts out as an individual that is suffering from Acrophobia, which causes Vertigo (Dizziness), after a tragic encounter on a rooftop where an officer died trying to save his life. Guilt stricken by this event, he quits the police force. This sense of guilt precisely seems to be what causes Scottie to want to escape from reality, and see Madeleine as his dream woman, something so surreal and dream-like without him even realizing it. Later it is of course revealed that she was in fact never real, further escalating his descent into madness, and feeding his pathological hunger for her. After Madeleine seemingly jumps off a clock tower, falling to her death, Scottie, a year later, is still haunted by his past memories of her, and sees a mirage of her appear in every one of these places. After later spotting a lookalike ( She was in fact the same woman as Madeleine ) Judy, Scottie becomes obsessed with turning her into his image of Madeleine, the fake image of the woman in question. This is of course a superb bit of character development, and Scottie goes through many different personality phases during the course of the film, being the seemingly average joe near the start, to trying to become the hero he is not, to falling into madness and becoming consumed by obsession near its end.As for the story itself, which concludes in Gavin Elster throwing his wife out the clocktower ( Scottie in fact never met Madeleine, only Judy ), it is a brilliantly written mystery filled with an unpredictable twist in that everything was a farce made up by Gavin to think his wife committed suicide, which of course all sounds very Hitchcockian. But again, Vertigo's true strength does not solely come from this, but with the way Hitchcock develops these characters, uses the color palette, blocking & camera movements to tell a visual story. The symbolism of color and movement in Vertigo is endless, but a primary example of this is the desaturation of the color red in the background when Scottie first sees Madeline, which emphasizes his future love & longing for her, and of course the color red is generally associated with those particular emotions. Another great example is when Judy finally 'turns back' into Madeleine, covered by a ghostly green tint, to signify that it is indeed a dead woman's image that he loves. These are just one of the many examples where Hitchcock uses color to invoke emotions in the audience.Of course one cannot forget the incredible contibution of composer Bernard Herrmann to this picture. Quite possibly his greatest score, his works for Vertigo ( Heavily influenced by Richard Wagner's Tristan und Isolde Prelude ) are a work of art in itself, perfectly encapsulating the tone of the movie, as Tristan & Isolde is also about doomed love, just like the film. When Herrmann's score hits its climax ( Judy turning into Madeleine ), the most personally significant event in the story happens, meaning the placement of the various themes is also fantastic.Vertigo has a superb mystery narrative for the first hour, and an incredible characterization piece during the second hour. All the while it is brilliantly acted, written, photographed, but above all expertly directed by Hitchcock himself, making it indeed a remarkable achievement and a superb piece of art.",Vertigo

348,Det_McNulty,One Of The Many Films Which Personifies Hitchcock's Legacy,10,20 May 2007,"Many would argue that Vertigo is Hitchcock's true triumph, the film which defines his work and a film which has been a major influence on cinema as a whole. Vertigo is famous for many reasons; it is famous for being both a masterpiece and for being one of the most sexually-obsessive films ever made. As with most Hitchcock films sex is a frequently occurring and underlying theme, Hitchcock uses sexuality to propel the key narrative. Personally, I see Vertigo as an example of male-lust, obsession and perversion. Some might go as far as saying Vertigo is about Hitchcock's own attraction to women, which in Vertigo is dangerously perverse. Vertigo is a film which is open to interpretation and one which requires the utmost concentration. To fully gain the film's brilliance you need to first re-watch it, as the common trend is to be perplexed by the film's complex narrative structure.Vertigo continues to be one of the optimal psychological thrillers, a film which has stood the test of time and becomes greater and greater with age. Vertigo is the tale of ""Scottie"" (played by James Stewart), a San Francisco policeman who is haunted by his severe acrophobia, which is caused from the guilt of an accidental death he feels responsible for. Due to Scott's condition he feels confined to secluding himself from police work, until an old friend asks him a favour. The favour is to ""spy"" on his beautiful wife Madeleine (Kim Novak), who he has become suspicious off due to the idea that she is possessed by a dead relative. So, Scottie tracks down Madeline, while quickly becoming pulled inside a mysterious and menacing world of lies and obsession.There are countless occurring themes throughout Hitchcock's films, which include mistaken identity, voyeurism, obsession, sexual compulsion, reliance, absurdity, paradoxes, irony and perversion. All of these contribute to making Hitchcock's films some of the most analytically accessible. Vertigo is an example of just how fierce Hitchcock can be through the harsh tones that he has etched into the film. The delicate moments of brief intimacy in Vertigo are ones which become abruptly destroyed by painful sorrow. These moments are devastating, as you are watching a man become more and more entranced by a woman he is failing to grasp.Hitchcock uses hypnotically mesmerising camera work and dizzying lens filtering to create an unbearably ominous ""Hitchcockian"" environment. The stark colours, which are wonderfully vibrant, help to create a sincere mood of looming menace and tension. The use of perspective distortion (most notably the Dolly zoom) is another factor of the sublime skill behind the camera. When establishing the film's meaning you have to carefully annotate the use of colours, shadows and mirrors, which are all, used as metaphors for the protagonist's emotions and help to craft Scottie as one of the most multi-dimensional characters in cinematic history.With the additional blending of Bernard Herrmann's score you find yet another addition to add to the film's distinguishable quality at creating an extremely polarising and cold ambiance. Finally, you have the outstanding set-pieces and one in particular which will linger in the depths of your mind for eternity. What makes the set-pieces so perfect is how they are so remarkably appropriate for the essence of each scene.The acting from the entire cast is indistinguishable, in the sense that the acting is so sublime that it is actually too difficult to truly say who gave a better performance than the other. Although, I will certainly express how James Stewart's surprising casting as a fairly menacing character is one which remains one of the most unexpectedly perfected performances of all-time. He slides into the character with a cold-hearted and unnerving stance, providing insight into a multi-dimensional character which can be scrutinised to the finest detail for hours on end. Though, it is still not James Stewart's greatest performance (I would give It's a Wonderful Life the edge) it is unquestionably the finest film he ever starred in.Vertigo is the film which signifies Hitchcock's own persona, while categorically remaining his ultimate masterpiece. Few films can succeed in captivating and entrancing countless emotions upon its viewer. Vertigo is cinematic flawlessness.",Vertigo
349,mcsheehey,Hitchcock Strikes Again,10,29 September 2007,"""Vertigo"" is perhaps Hitchcock's most twisted film, but it is also one of his best, as well as one of the best films ever made. Everything about the film is pitch-perfect. I won't disclose plot details here so as not to spoil anyone who hasn't seen the film yet, but I will say the following.The casting in ""Vertigo"" could have failed miserable had it not been done in such a careful manner. Jimmy Stewart is probably the most likable actor in film history, which makes him the only person in the world who could have played the main role in this film without repulsing the audience. He keeps the main role of Scotty afloat for the entire film when no other actor could've done the same with such a twisted role. The same could be said of Kim Novak, who portrays the leading lady perfectly, managing to appear devious and sympathetic in alternating frames. Still, my favorite performance of the film is that of the role of Midge. Barbare plays this desperate friend of Scotty's in such a sympathetic way that we almost want Scotty to run off and marry her, even if it means ruining the film.""Vertigo"" is a well-made film all around. The cinematography is creepy and enchanting, as is the beautifully composed script. Of course, the real star of the film id=s the classic Bernard Hermann score, which is one of his best, probably second only to the score for ""Psycho."" In ""Vertigo,"" Hitchcock masterfully proves that he is not solely a murder mystery director, and that he can create suspense even in a love affair between two deeply troubled characters. It's twisted, certainly, but it has to be. It's a fantastic film and one of the master's best.",Vertigo
350,TedMichaelMor,Revealing Nightmare,10,19 June 2010,"Hitchcock's nightmare vision of the deadening influence of male desire on women's lives haunts imagination. Wendy Lesser wrote one of several insightful feminist evaluations of this masterwork that stress the immense power and honesty of the director's work here. Hitchcock commented precisely on the nature of the narrative.For many years, I listed this on my top ten list of films. It belongs there at least as much as any one of seven of the films I presently note belongs there.Taking the plot too literally and demanding much sense from it undermine the nightmare quality—this is a dream experience, a bad dream experience, an awful dream, but one that is true. I first saw it when I was 15-years-old. Now, I am 67-years-old. The film still informs my sense of romance and sexuality.I have opinions about the restoration but they do not concern me profoundly.

351,sngbrd39,Obsession and the unexpected,9,21 June 2010,"A couple weeks ago, I wrote a comment about another Hitchcock classic, Rear Window. Tonight, I had the chance to see Vertigo for the first time. While I must admit that I didn't like it quite as much as the former film, Vertigo is still a masterfully crafted work of suspense by the man who did it best.John ""Scottie"" Ferguson has just retired from the police force, but he has been persuaded to take on a case privately. A college friend is concerned about his wife who has been acting more and more strangely, and Scottie must follow her to discover where she goes in her frequent flights. What follows is a tale of obsession and the unexpected.The one thing that I liked more about Rear Window than about Vertigo is that we got to know the characters better. In Vertigo, most of the characters are either undergoing insanity or pulling off a deception, meaning that we don't really have insight into who these people are. This does not detract from the intrigue or excitement, but it's just something I personally didn't like as much here.On the upside, though, I do believe that Hitchcock created another great work of suspense here. To me, the film was most enhanced by the wonderful cinematography of Robert Burks and the as-always-expressive score of Bernard Hermann. Everything that is seen and heard in the film enhances the story Hitchcock is presenting to us, and it's really a treat for eyes and ears both.Vertigo is a film full of suspense that will keep you guessing throughout. It provides more evidence of the genius of its director.",Vertigo
352,alexx668,Vertigo,8,19 January 2007,"Hitchcock was on a roll during that period. Vertigo is one of his most celebrated films, even though it's modeled after Rebecca in that it's 3 films rolled into one: a love story, a metaphysical thriller, and a suspense drama. Nevertheless, the difference between the Hitchcock of 1940 and the Hitchcock of 1958 is vast. The Hitchcock of Vertigo is a much more elaborate director, that dwells on the human psyche to fill the canvas. The human psyche is the protagonist, the suspense is just the background, or even a detail. Vertigo is a major work and an essay on neurosis and repressed desire.The plot: John Ferguson is a retired detective suffering from acrophobia. A rich old friend (Gavin Elster) hires him to investigate the activities of his wife (Madeleine), who he believes is being possessed by the spirit of a dead ancestor (Carlotta Valdes). After seeing Madeleine, Ferguson agrees. Later on, we see that Madeleine half-lives in Carlotta Valdes' house, spends a lot of time in front of a Carlotta painting in a museum, and generally models her behaviour after Carlotta. Also, Madeleine suffers from blackouts, during which she isn't in control of herself. Ferguson forms a relationship with her. He then pressures her to get rid of the past by dwelling on it, visiting places where Carlotta lived etc. During such a visit, and in the same day Carlotta died, Madeleine commits suicide by falling from the bell-tower of a chapel. Ferguson is unable to rescue her due to his acrophobia.Following this, Ferguson is placed in a mental hospital, suffering from catatonic depression. After some time, we find Ferguson released from the mental institution and in better shape. He then meets a woman who looks a lot like Madeleine. Nevertheless, the woman, Judy Barton, seems less perfect and more vulgar than Madeleine. Ferguson forms a relationship with her, and is trying to model her after Madeleine, buying her the same clothes etc. But during one of their encounters, the truth is revealed due to Barton's carelessness. She used the same jewelry as Madeleine. Barton and Madeleine is the same woman. In truth, Madeleine/ Barton was a ""doppelganger"" to Elster's wife. Elster hired her in order to kill his rich wife, and manipulated Ferguson's illness so that he was a witness to the ""suicide"". It was the wife, and not Madeleine that fell from the tower.Unaware that Ferguson knows the truth, Barton continues the relationship and the ""transformation"" to Madeleine. She now is in love with Ferguson, but Ferguson is intent on freeing himself from his acrophobia. As Barton is completely transformed to Madeleine, Ferguson takes her to the same chapel and to the bell tower. Forcing her up, she confesses the truth. She claims she is in love with him. She then sees a shadow emerging, panics and falls into the void. It turns out that the shadow was just a nun. Ferguson stands and watches from above. He is cured....This is not an easy film to analyze. It is very dense and has lots of hidden meaning beneath the surface. The most obvious theme is the one of fixation and impotence. Ferguson suffers from vertigo; Madeleine seems to be possessed by a dead spirit; Ferguson's friend Midge is in love with him but unable to express her love and conquer him; then when Madeleine dies Ferguson becomes obsessed with her.Madeleine represents the ideal love, perfection.In the meantime, there are some other interesting ideas floating in the background. One is that in the second half of the film we witness a reverse situation than that of the first half. In the first half, Elster and Madeleine manipulate Ferguson's impotence. In the second half, it is Ferguson that manipulates the less-than-perfect version of Madeleine (aka Barton), even though she regrets her accomplice and is genuinely in love with him.The ending, as well as the first half, is shrouded in the metaphysical and supernatural. The shadow that Madeleine/ Barton sees could be anything: a ghost, her guilt, Elster, the dark side of her relationship with Ferguson etc. Ferguson models Barton after Madeleine with almost necrophiliac obsession. Just before the second time that Madeleine ""dies"", she and Ferguson kiss, representing the ephemeral happiness in vain. After she dies, Ferguson is freed from his impotence, but we don't know his feelings, we just see him watching from above. Basically Ferguson is haunted by his search for perfection (an ideal love, a god to believe in?). There is a clear parallel between that and his impotence (the vertigo). When he tries to transform the down-to-earth Barton to the perfect Madeleine, the illusion isn't working. In order to cure himself from the impotence, he kills her (he was the one that dragged her to the chapel).Moreover, what the film seems to project is the vortex of the human psyche. Both in the first and the second half, the conclusion is the same: the woman dies. It's the behaviour of the male protagonist alters dramatically. In the supernatural first half, the protagonist is crippled, while in the down-to-earth second half, he is more free but also less happy.The real moment Ferguson is freed is when he realizes the truth about Madeleine. Madeleine/ Barton is sitting in front of a mirror (representing the dual personality). Then Ferguson sees the jewel and immediately thinks of the portrait of Carlotta Valdes (a symbolism of the original sin? He and Madeleine had an adulterous affair after all). Vertigo projects the male-female relationship into the conflict between the human and the ideal (the supernatural, the belief in the perfect). But there is no way out. Both stories (the first and second half) are two sides of the same coin.",Vertigo
353,daviddaphneredding,an excellent weaving by Hitchcock,10,28 May 2016,"This is one of my favorite Hitchcock films, the other two being North by Northwest and the comical The Trouble with Harry. The setting of San Francisco was, in my personal opinion, a big drawing card. To be sure, Hitchcock knew well how to weave together suspense, romance, and mystery. James Stewart and Kim Novak clicked well together in this masterpiece by the master of suspense. And, Kim Novak was quite talented at playing two roles in this movie. Stewart was also adept at playing two types of people, a kind, good natured man, but also a hostile, temperamental man in places. You wanted to hate Tom Elmore. It was structured so very well also; it was almost like two dramas in one. Bernard Herrmann, an excellent musician, definitely and effectively provided the needed eeriness for the film.

355,cafescott,Olive oil on rubber plant leaves,10,8 December 2014,"""Vertigo"" (1958, Alfred Hitchcock﻿), deserves its reputation as the greatest American film ever made. Despite its ridiculously far-fetched story, it mesmerizes even after dozens of screenings. As great as Hitchcock's form is here, Bernard Hermann﻿'s beautiful, symphonic score is also essential to the experience. It would be nice if some of the growing numbers of young head-down-and-texters would venture over to the revival theater showing this cinematic landmark in order to understand how much farther great culture can lift a soul than a QWERTY keyboard can. ""Vertigo"" opens with an enigma: How does San Francisco Detective John ""Scotty"" Ferguson (Jimmy Stewart) survive hanging from a rain gutter from a great height? No hint is provided. The murder plot is similarly perplexing. For example, how could a murderer risk easy exposure if the intended witness manages to overcome acrophobia and climb the stairs of a steep tower? We toss away plausibility when experiencing Hitchcock's universe, but the payoff here is huge.The famous reveal in 'Vertigo' is the subject of much scholarly discussion. (The film's twist is revealed about 25 minutes before it might have used as a surprise.) According to legend, every leading figure involved in the production disagreed with Hitchcock on the reveal, including Mrs. Hitchcock. Hitchcock had to fend them off. In his subsequent interview with François Truffaut﻿, he explains his preference for suspense, not surprise.There are several very widely-read biographies of Alfred Hitchcock with co-workers all saying he was impossible to like on a personal level. In ""Vertigo"", the two leads have a strong argument. Despite how effortlessly the very gifted Jimmy Stewart﻿ plays Scotty, Hitchcock is said to have blamed Stewart's premature aging for ""Vertigo's"" box office failure. Hitchcock never worked with Stewart again, breaking up a legendary collaboration (of four superlative films). In addition, Hitchcock was unhappy with Kim Novak﻿, and is said to have publicly criticized her after 'Vertigo' was released. (Novak maintained a dignified silence.) I don't know what Hitchcock said about Novak, but it seems that Hitchcock has some thin department-store models showing off female clothing to Scotty and Madeleine. Also, when one of the sales women tells Scotty that Judy can wear a particular woman's suit after ""alterations,"" perhaps the comment and the slender models are both knocks on Novak's weight.Still, Hitchcock's characters show tremendous depth. Scotty's former love interest Midge (Barbara Bel Geddes) is uniquely endearing. The scene where Midge tearfully destroys her witty painting (a spoof on Scotty's obsession) is really heart-wrenching. So is Midge's final appearance, the somber walk down the hallway in the sanitarium. Hitchcock really connects with lonely hearts through Midge. It is ironic that an artist as universally disliked by the people who worked with him could produce such profound moments with common people as we see him portray Scotty's forgotten ex-girlfriend. People tend to forget this when teeing off on Alfred Hitchcock, the man.If you have watched 'Vertigo' a few time notice how Hitchcock manipulates point of view. For example, when we first see Scotty after the opening predicament, he is in Midge's apartment. Seated but physically diminished, Scotty is balancing a cane when he says, ""ouch."" The background is particularly busy. There is visual chaos all around Stewart's outline. It looks as if the background objects just fell from a height, not Scotty. Scotty is being under-appreciated. It is also interesting when another point of view (besides Scotty's) is being represented. For example, we see the floating petals from Madeleine's flower just before she jumps into San Francisco Bay. Another example is when Madeleine revisits the murder with her flashback. It lasts a few seconds but her side of the story is clearly identified. (That is, it appears filmed in a manner that conveys her as a reluctant pawn in a larger conspiracy.) Hitchcock is never just pointing a camera at a set where some action is taking place. He plans every visual detail before filming begins. Cinephiles already know what a great film 'Vertigo' is. It is a perennial pleasure that never gets stale. However, please don't take any ill-advised leaps across rooftops getting to the revival theater showing it.",Vertigo

357,henrymadman,Well Done Alfred you've done it again.,10,4 July 2007,"Vertigo is a 1958 psychological thriller directed by Alfred Hitchcock. The film features James Stewart, Kim Novak and Barbara Bel Geddes. The film tells the story of a Vertigo sufferer and police detective, John Ferguson, who believes that his newly found girlfriend is a reincarnation of a possessed woman who he saw commit suicide in the San Francisco Bay, after being assigned to investigate what was wrong with her. Both women are portrayed by Novak.It was premiered in the San Sebastian International Film Festival on May 8, 1958, where it was received poorly, polarising both critics and commercial audiences. However, as the film aged, it has become one of the most recognised, acclaimed American films ever made. In 1989, Vertigo was recognised as a ""culturally, historically and aesthetically significant"" film by the National Film Registry and subsequently restored internationally in 1996.",Vertigo

359,krumski,"SPOILERS GALORE! If you've never seen the movie, DON'T READ this review!",5,17 February 2000,"I suppose this is some kind of masterpiece, what with the absolutely overwhelming photography, powerful score and all - but I must say I just couldn't get into it. We're made to be patient through a looooong exposition (Scottie following her around), which I didn't mind at first because I said, ""Hey it's Hitchcock - the payoff will be worth it."" Well, it wasn't. Scottie's obsession was inexplicable to me (and, yes, I realize that Kim Novak is hot); maybe the writing was weak in not giving him a strong and clear enough motivation for going over the edge (what were his other romantic attachments like? Why is *this* one in particular so extremely excessive? Knowing these things would help) or maybe it's just that I can't buy Jimmy Stewart in this type of role. He projects too much groundedness, dignity and common sense for him to be convincing as this kind of obsessional basket case (the scene with him in the asylum was particularly embarrassing and unconvincing; he doesn't look ""crazy"" - he looks like Jimmy Stewart just refusing to say his lines). Maybe an actor a bit more rumpled and on the edge - Robert Mitchum, say - could have brought the part off better (and I'm a *huge* Jimmy Stewart fan, just so you don't get the wrong idea).My biggest problem, however, is with the final third of the movie. Excuse me, but I just don't think it was a good idea to reveal the murder plot and its actual machinations two-thirds of the way into the film. Not knowing for certain up until the very end whether ""Judy"" was really ""Madeleine"" or whether Scottie was indeed just imagining things would have been much MUCH more effective. It would have pulled the viewer in, kept him guessing and psychologically on edge all the way through. Once you know that Scottie is ""correct"" in his assumption, not only is the tension gone and you're no longer immediately connected to the story, also you can't truly buy his craziness or obsession as a thematic point since, after all, he's ""right."" I believe this to be one of the all-time biggest scripting mistakes in the history of cinema. Hitchcock has said, though, that suspense is not what he was primarily after in this movie. He wanted to reveal the murder plot early so it wouldn't get in the way of the attention paid to Scottie's disintegration. But without the suspense, Scottie's disintegration just looks stupid. It's like the end of the movie has already come and gone, and yet the director is still forcing us to sit through a drawn-out and pointless epilogue that just takes foreeeeeever. . . And the ending - what's with that?! She sees a nun and so she jumps off the roof? It's absolutely RIDICULOUS - so abrupt and nonsensical, as if the editor suddenly told Hitchcock that he had to end the film RIGHT NOW, and he had to think of something fast. Clearly, the best ending (if the film had to go this long) would have been for her to slip off the edge, and then have Scottie try but fail to save her - thus mirroring his failure to save the cop at the beginning of the movie from falling, giving the whole thing a neat little symmetry. That Hitchcock failed to see the absolute rightness of this conclusion makes me wonder about his status as a cinematic genius.Well, ok, I won't go that far - Hitch's reputation is safe. But Vertigo's isn't; this is no masterpiece, and far from the director's greatest work. Instead, this is the one film where he deserted his ""popcorn"" approach to creating thrills and opted for a more pensive and ""mature"" style, thinking this would prove him the artist so many denied that he was. It does just the opposite - by playing down what he did best (building and sustaining suspense), Hitchcock is left rudderless, and his attempt at ""adult"" themes just look embarrassing. It's beautiful to look at, of course - one of the most sumptuous visual experiences in the entire history of movies. The redwoods scene, and the Golden Gate Bridge - fantastic! The scenes in the museum, too - absolutely ravishing. But, alas, great photography does not make a great movie. If only Vertigo were a coffee table book, then it might truly deserve the classic status it has been accorded. I don't know, I guess if you're a fan of the technical aspects of cinema, and love Hitchcock for his visual bravura and like to analyze his technique, there's probably a lot here for you to enjoy (and is no doubt why it's so loved by other directors). But if you're like me, and enjoy Hitchcock films for their pure ability to keep you tense and on the edge of your seat, Vertigo is not the film to watch.",Vertigo

361,jadedalex,Flawed and still one of Hitchcock's best,8,19 June 2010,"""Vertigo"" has to be one of Hitchcock's most personal films, along with ""Rear Window"". The story may be a bit convoluted for the average movie goer, but as a great lover of Hitchcock's films, I try to ignore some of the unbelievable plots and twists, and find ""Vertigo"" a haunting, beautiful film.Along with another of Hitchcock's best, ""North by Northwest"", ""Vertigo"" has some incredulous plot elements, but Hitchcock may be best along with the mentality of the Marx Brothers' ""Duck Soup"": to hell with a credible story line, but ""Vertigo"", like ""North by Northwest"", and like ""Duck Soup"", is great entertainment. Only one man could produce films like ""Psycho"", ""North by Northwest"" and ""Vertigo"". And that is Sir Alfred Hitchcock.My main problem with ""Vertigo"" is in the casting itself. Jimmy Stewart, one of the most beloved actors in the history of the screen, has almost no competition (with the exception of Henry Fonda) when it comes to playing the ""Everyman"". ""Rear Window"" saw a rather quirky Stewart, but anyone would go a little nuts with a leg cast on in a New York summer. In ""Vertigo"", he ably plays the former cop who must retire because of his terrible fear of heights.But then we are asked to believe that he becomes obsessed with a woman strangely haunted by the dead. The necrophiic undertones, the clothing fetishes - these may exist in the mind of Alfred Hitchcock, but I find it a bit of a stretch for Stewart to pull off.For me, Stewart's persona is just too ""normal"" to be believed in his role as ""Scotty"".Other than that, I don't find much wrong with this film. It's a complicated tale that you need to watch more than once. That may be another of the film's flaws.Herrmann's music is beautiful, and so is Kim Novak (in easily her best film role) as ""Madeline"".One of the most effective scenes is when Scotty and Madeline go the the redwood forest. The counting of the rings of the tree make us feel Madeline's, and our own, mortality.""Vertigo"" is a more complicated ""Rear Window"". But the themes of ""Rear Window"" are more recognizable to the audience. It is a personal film and a crowd pleaser (as was ""North by Northwest"") at the same time. ""Vertigo"" is even more personal, like seeing one too many skeletons in the Hitchcock closet. And its dark theme is an acquired taste.",Vertigo
362,cleary-joshua,"The best movie of all time? Not quite, but close...",9,26 August 2013,"""Sight and Sound"" magazine's 2012 poll named Alfred Hitchcock's ""Vertigo"" the best movie of all time. So, this review should settle the big question – is it really the best movie of all time? The answer to that is no, but it does make a very good case for itself. It's a detective story about obsession and fear, and the Master of Suspense manages to tackle both of those themes very well. In a shot that is now much mimicked and parodied, the ""Vertigo Shot"" seen when Stewart is climbing up the bell tower is still just as effective 55 years later, echoing the fear that Stewart has.The plot is extremely clever, with the first half following a classic yet slightly unnerving detective story, but the second half detailing the obsessions of Scottie and building up to the final reveal at the very end of the film. We are constantly lead to believe in the first half that something supernatural is going on with Madeline, and it is even more satisfying to find out towards the end that it is not, as the real explanation is just as good. The love that blossoms between the two of them is very interesting, as it makes her sudden 'suicide' even more shocking. In a technique that Hitchcock uses in 'Psycho' as well, killing off a main character unexpectedly in the first half of the movie works brilliantly in keeping the audience guessing where he will go next.The second half of the film allows us to see into the subconscious of Scottie, and we wonder constantly how much he knows about 'Judy' and how much is an obsession with 'Madeline'. His character is made to seem even creepier through the fact that he only realises very late that the two are the same, meaning that he has been making 'Judy' dress up as his recently deceased lover to satisfy his own needs. Hitchcock is clever in revealing sooner that they are the same character, as it adds more to our guessing how much he knows.Herrmann's score to the film is once again brilliant, with his romantic use of strings in the ""Love Theme"" and fantastic ""Prelude"" theme. The music complements the film perfectly, and is one of Herrmann's best scores for Hitchcock. So, with all of the positive things I've said, why isn't it up there for the best movie of all time? It's slightly overlong, and occasionally too confusing. But the main thing is that it's not Hitchcock's best work. It doesn't quite reach the great heights of his next two films – 'North by Northwest' or 'Psycho', both of which go slightly further in their mystery and cleverness. That said, it is another fantastic thriller from the Master, and a must see for any film lover.",Vertigo
363,kingcasey_iii,This movie makes Dan Brown novels seem intellectual.,1,7 June 2019,"This movie is so bad it makes the drivel that Dan Brown farts out in his novels seem as Classical literature of BOTH hemispheres.

He's given one last assignment to observe the daily goings of the wife of his client who is concerned that she's suffering from a personality disorder. She occasionally enters fuge states alternating between the spirit of a dead relative and herself.However this movie does have some examples of our early explorations into the experimental special effects, such as the mentioned depth perception to give visual views of dimensions to indicate height.... Without these experimentations our enjoyment of film settings would be very two dimensional.

He was stiff and pathetic at the end when his character could have emerged with manhood restored but instead becomes shrill and plain ridiculous and yes embarrassing.

367,kinolieber,Hitchcock in Love **SPOILER ALERT**,10,19 April 2002,"I saw this film for the first time when I was in my twenties in 1969 and was not impressed. My opinion since that initial viewing had always been that (*SPOILER ALERT*) it was one of the few Hitchcock films that did not reward repeated viewings since so much of the film is taken up by the initial deception. Once you know who ""Madeleine"" really is, that first hour is simply tedious.Then, when I was in my forties, I saw the restored film at New York's Ziegfeld Theatre in 70 mm. I fully expected to be bored by it. Instead, it was one of the most powerfully emotional film experiences I have ever had.
'Heartbreaking' is not a word I ever thought of applying to a Hitchcock film, but that is exactly what Vertigo is. I have seen it a number of times since its restoration, and far from being tedious, it seems richer and more complex, and yes, more heartbreaking each time. The final image of Scottie standing on that ledge is devastating. Is he there to look one last time at his love object or to follow her by jumping to his own death? Brilliantly, Hitchcock fades out on the image.
After seeing the film recently, I was amazed by how it breaks all the rules of the suspense genre. The way it reveals its 'surprise ending' two thirds of the way through the film, and then completely changes focus, first generating suspense over whether Scottie will discover Judy's secret, then over whether Judy will discover that he HAS discovered her secret, and then over what he intends to do about it. Finally, in the film's most wrenching turnabout, we experience Scottie's incredible rage over what has been done to him (How was it that Stewart wasn't even nominated for this performance?)and after the rage comes that final kiss when he has to be weighing the possibility that he may find happiness with Judy in spite of everything, and then, abruptly, even that possibility is torn from his arms as he loses her finally forever.

368,athomed,"Hired by an old friend, compelled by a new love, destroyed by his same old self",10,19 April 2012,"I usually don't write reviews with spoilers. Vertigo is one of those films you just can't discuss without spoilers. The entire movie is a spoiler in that sense; detailing any portion of the plot can and will give away valuable information that first-time viewers shouldn't know. It's just that kind of movie.Alfred Hitchcock and James Stewart reunited after the success of Rear Window to make Vertigo. This would be their last collaboration together. Enough has been written already about the reasons for their film-making departure. We get to look back in retrospect and appreciate this movie for its greatness, and also with the knowledge that this was Hitchcock and Stewart's last hurrah together.I'm sure there are a million ways to interpret this film. A theme I find most interesting, nearest to my heart, is that of unrequited love.Midge's love for Scottie is foolish. She's loved him since college, even though he doesn't feel the same way. Scottie practically toys with Midge's affection for him during their scenes together. When Midge plays a joke on Scottie by painting the Portrait of Carlotta but replacing Carlotta's head with her own, Scottie abruptly leaves. She berates herself afterward with the ferocity, and the frustration, of a woman who's tried to gain Scottie's affection time and time again, only to fall short time and time again.Scottie's love for Madeleine is creepy; it's obsessive. When she's gone, he seeks out another woman just like her, not knowing they are in fact the same woman, though neither being the one he's after, and tries to make her into Madeleine. She can't love him because she's not real. His compulsion to create another Madeleine consumes every bit of humanity left in him.Judy's love for Scottie is hopeless. He doesn't love her. He loves a part she played. Like a man who marries an actress and then spends more time thinking about a role she played than the actual woman he married. She has every incentive not to fall in love with Scottie during her and Gavin's morbid gag, but she still does. Judy's love is so hopeless that she's willing to transform herself into Scottie's fantasy and play that part, the one that truly pleases him, for the rest of her life.Scottie finds himself on another ledge by the end of the film, he's licked his acrophobia, but at the expense of his humanity. The film comes full circle, as we consider how he spurned Midge in favor of Madeleine, and then couldn't return Judy's love because of his fixation on the dream woman who never existed. We're left to wonder, did Scottie ever love at all? Was he capable of love to begin with?",Vertigo
369,Primtime,Classic Hitch Thriller,8,6 February 1999,"Vertigo is a special kind of film. This is because it doesn't follow the usual way a film is presented to the viewer. Rather than having the main suspense near the end of the film, Vertigo has this high level of suspense at both the end and middle of the film. Few could have pulled this off quite as well as Hitch.I really liked this film in the stylish way it was presented. Time is not overly spent getting into the characters here, they are simply presented for who they are leaving the judgement up to the viewer. The ""Vertigo"" special effect and the nightmare sequence were done like nothing I have ever seen for a film of this time and are enchanting and timeless. The plot and storyline of this film are both original and not cliched. The audience is taken by surprise during the middle of the film and from there on the film becomes even more suspenseful.Jimmy Stewart put another of his great performances into this film and played well opposite Kim Novak's dark and confused character. Stewart shows the full range of emotions as he is taken by the alluring Madeline (Novak) and is driven to a deep depression. Novak had been criticized for playing her role too darkly which is a claim I find completely unfounded. For a woman who is going through so much stress (or at least we are to believe that), she plays as well as this role could have been done. The interesting thing about the performances in this film is how much time Stewart and Novak are on the screen. For 95% of the film, there is not another character to add anything else to the plot. Other than Barbara Bel Geddes, who gives a short, supporting performance, the film revolves around the realtionship between Ferguson (Stewart) and Madeline.I must say that I enjoyed this film just as much as Rear Window and would even put this one above North by Northwest. Hitchcock does suspense so well and is quite obvious to see why he is imitated so much. A recommendation to all.8/10 stars.",Vertigo

The condition leads to vertigo, a psychosomatic illness which produces dizziness and the sensation of drifting in spinning space. Shortly, after his resignation from the police force-Scottie is asked by an old school friend, Gavin Elster ( Tom Helmore), to follow his wife Madeline ( Kim Novak), who he says, is suicidal and believes that a long-dead relative has come back to possess her. Scottie takes the assignment and subsequently falls in love with Madeline, after he saves her from drowning herself in the San Francisco Bay.At its core, Vertigo is a tale of obsession. It works because it is a human story. Quite a bizarre story, but quite a human one. Its major theme is quite simply that a romantic fantasy is a dangerous hoax, potentially fatal. In Stewart's, Scottie there is a complex web of attraction and repulsion. For example, it is quite horrifying how much alike Scottie and Gavin actually are.Another major standout of Vertigo is it's location. San Francisco, itself with its rolling fog, and dizzying heights, the waters of the bay. Every element of the film essentially, is linked to every other element: each color, each wardrobe ( Madeline/Judy's eerie gray suit). The entire film is filled with beautiful image after another.For me the scene of the entire film, is the last scene of the film, the final dialogue-between Scottie and 'Judy'. The rage, frustration, and grief in Scottie's voice, and the shame and fear in 'Judy's' voice are real and authentic. They are also probably two of the best moments in the screen careers of Stewart and Novak. In several interviews, Hitchcock himself spoke of his ' dissatisfaction' with Kim Novak's performance, but I think she gives one hell of a heartbreaking and moving performance.

While the world leaving ""white and black"", the cinema producers of course started to use coloured film technology. But I must say that this film would be amazing if it was screened in ""white and black"". Both quality and the impact that it makes is important for me.Based on a novel, Vertigo explains a story about a man and his wife. This story includes John Ferguson who is a detective fearing from heights because of an accident in which a policeman died while trying to save John on the roof. This tragic event occurs while both of them chasing a guilty. Anyway, John becomes a popular man and waits for retirement. But his old friend from college Gavin Elster knows all about John and wants him to follow his wife with the doubt of she treats like a woman who has lived in past. In fact, Elster's purpose is to kill his wife to pose as she commits suicide and he wants to use John as witness. For this purpose Gavin works with a woman whose aspect is like his wife. The plan is founded to do on a tower of church because of John's phobia of height and so fake Mrs. Elster will walk up but John will go left half finished.From starting almost 90 minutes may make you get asleep but after that you may say that Hitchcock could do his best. Fake Mrs. Elster's fake suicide and John's efforts to performing the event are the resembles of creativity of Hitchcock. Performances of Kim Novak and James Stewart are also as wonderful as the director.Examining partly, you may not feel usual Hitchcock intensive tension, but it's completely a spectacular film. Two more criticism about some scenes: First is starting scene in which policeman didn't shoot the guilty from near distance and second is the John's following scenes with car.

The plot of this movie is more supernatural and magical than some of his others. It's largely a mystery and psychological thriller, but it has elements of numerous genres as well.It's full of different plot twists, and while some things one can figure out well in advance, others completely took me off guard. Almost every moment gave me a feeling of apprehension and excitement. Everything in the film feels uncanny and too good to be true, yet so convincingly done. The evolution of the protagonist from a do-gooder, to a heartbroken lover to a total wreck is done swiftly though impactfully.I love Hitchcock.

381,lauraeileen894,Psychological masterpiece,10,18 September 2005,"No Alfred Hitchcock film has been picked at, dissected, debated, and analyzed as much as ""Vertigo"". There's good reason: ""Vertigo"" has the most complex and surreal storyline of any of Hitch's classics. The commercials you may have seenfor ""Vertigo"", the trailers, or the plot summaries are completely misleading. This is not a love story. It's not even about James Stewart's fear of heights. It's about the dark, twisted side of human nature and the atrocities we're capable of when we allow ourselves to be driven by fear, greed, illusions, and obsession.John ""Scottie"" Ferguson (James Stewart) is a retired detective who's haunted by guilt over an accident that had an officer killed and left Scottie with a newly developed fear of heights. One day, Scottie receives an unexpected request by an old friend, Gavin Elster (Tom Helmore) to shadow Elster's wife Madeleine (Kim Novak). Elster believes that Madeleine is being possessed by the spirit of her great-grandmother, Carlotta Valdez, a woman who went insane and committed suicide. Ester fears that Madeleine will suffer the same fate. So Scottie agrees to follow the strange and stoic Madeleine, a coldly beautiful blonde who moves as if sleepwalking. When she jumps into San Francisco Bay, Scottie rescues her and soon falls in love with her, and she with him. But as their relationship grows, Scottie's love turns into obsession, and it only escalates when it seems he is unable to protect Madeleine from Carlotta's vindictive spiritIf you are unfamiliar with what happens next, I will stop there. What happens next must take you by surprise. By 1958 Stewart had proved that he had range and a dark side in his acting, but never did he exemplify it more than in ""Vertigo"". His character goes on such a downward spiral that even after all that Scottie's been through, we're not so sure we want to root for him anymore. Kim Novak makes an inspired Hitchcock Blonde. With her stiff mannerisms, translucent skin, pale blonde hair and famous gray suit, she almost gives the impression of being encased in ice in the early outdoor scenes.One of ""Vertigo""'s biggest surprises is Barbara Bel Geddes as Scottie's close friend Midge. Bel Geddes (who died in August 2005 at the age of 82) is absolutely magnificent, bringing depth and refreshing warmth to a potentially thankless part. You really feel for Midge when Scottie, blinded by his infatuation with Madeleine, cruelly brushes their friendship aside and all but abandons Midge. On bad days I can't figure out what Scottie sees in frigid basket case Madeleine as opposed to warm and witty Midge.Minor quibble aside, ""Vertigo"" is an honest-to-God masterpiece, with its hypnotic opening credits by Saul Bass, sinister, mind bending Bernard Herrman score, dizzying suspense scenes, and bizarre love story. It is not to be missed.",Vertigo
382,benjamin_lappin,Possibly The Greatest...,10,16 February 2007,"...thriller of all time, the cinematic masterminding of Alfred Hitchcock serves up one of the few films which could make a gem look like a pebble, it is wonderfully crafted. Rear Window was absorbing, and Psycho and North By Northwest speak for themselves, but this is a film which has you intrigued from the word go, yet you're never overly sure as to why. Whether it be through plot shifts or the perfectly sculpted characters, Hitchcock has created a film highlighting the very essences of what is required to a successful, and more importantly, damned good thriller.Clocking in at just over two hours, Hitchock lavishly presents us the story of one man who having been an active police officer, places himself in self imposed exile, after an exposer to dangerous heights. Confined to the pavement, he is presently recruited by an old acquaintance who, aware of his former policing abilities, wishes him to track his wife who is suffering from what can only be described as mental psychosis. It is from this point out that Hitchcock shines as he spins webs with delicious cinematography and a compelling storyline which takes us through highs and lows, and ultimately through one of the most offbeat and often disturbing romances in cinematic history.Nothing short of excellent, no critic or IMDb film reviewer can articulate the pedestal this film deserves to be placed upon. It is a masterpiece of the highest order, and only furthers Hitchocks' talents through the varying mediums of film, with his trademark macabre fantasy for harming blonde's. The film is sumptuously shot and acted to near perfection with Kim Novak enchanting and James Stewart with what could possibly be described as his most engaging and pristine performance. For anyone who claims to be even the slightest bit interested in film, Vertigo is essential, however due to its supreme status as a masterpiece, be warned, it's a long way down from here.",Vertigo
383,kira02bit,"Not one of Hitchcock's best, despite its ""rediscovery"" in recent years",3,29 June 2017,"Bring up the title Vertigo now and no doubt cinema elites will immediately fall into rapturous descriptions of its brilliance. This is interesting largely because for many years, Vertigo did not even rank very highly in the Hitchcock milieu until its re-evaluation as a ""classic"" in the past two decades.For those unfamiliar, Vertigo tells the story of John ""Scottie"" Ferguson, a police detective whose brush with death while chasing a culprit over San Francisco rooftops results in another police officer falling to his death while trying to save Scottie and Scottie's now being afflicted with a paralyzing fear of heights. On leave from the department and struggling with his recovery, Scottie is offered a detective assignment by a former college acquaintance Gavin Elster to shadow his wife Madeleine, who he fears is losing her mind and may be suicidal. Scottie falls in love with the enigmatic blond Madeleine, but finds himself unable to stop her when she races to the top of a convent bell tower and takes a swan dive off. Emotionally fragile and psychologically shattered, Scottie develops new purpose when he runs across shopgirl Judy Barton who physically resembles the late Madeleine, and he starts to remake her in Madeleine's image with tragic results for all involved.Strangely, for many years, if you asked anyone to name their favorite Hitchcock films, there was a strong chance that Vertigo would not even crack the top ten. Now, it seems marketing makes it essential to include it at the top, but I am uncertain it earns this newfound glory. Certainly the film contains some of Hitchcock's hallmarks and some notable elements. The cinematography is gorgeous and Bernard Herrmann's haunting and menacing score is one of his best. Hitchcock also includes some memorable dream-like sequences. That said, I find little else to recommend the film.The film starts off well enough and it seems that it is gearing up to be one of Hitchcock's trademark mysteries, but then the mystery element is completely dropped midway through and the film becomes an overview on unhealthy obsession. There are no real surprises on the road to the film's tortured climax. Anyone familiar with prior Hitchcock work and genre conventions will know exactly what is going on long before Scottie lumberingly figures things out. Hitchcock lets the cat out of the bag on the Madeleine/Judy connection fairly quickly (in fact, almost immediately after introducing Judy), so there is no chance for the viewer to play around with various views on it.Hitchcock's work with the actors here is more miss than hit. James Stewart is an actor I normally love, but I find him a real endurance test here as Scottie. He is sympathetic enough in the opening as a man trying to conquer his fears and get his life back on track. Unfortunately, he starts to grate once on the tail of Madeleine. His stab at conveying his increasingly unhealthy interest in Madeleine largely has him glowering at the camera and furrowing his brow much like someone combating intestinal discomfort. There are endless scenes of him behind the wheel of his car with this fixed expression. The fact that there is several decades age difference between Stewart and leading lady, Kim Novak, is made even more uncomfortable by the fact that Stewart often looks old enough to be her grandfather rather than her romantic foil. Novak is beautiful, but stiff and undoubtedly directed by Hitchcock to be the embodiment of his trademark blonde ice queen. Barbara Bel Geddes has little more than a cameo as Stewart's girlfriend, who sticks by him through his rehab and then disappears without a mention.Another problem with the film is that it is hard to be emotionally involved or have sympathy with the players. Scottie is initially sympathetic and focuses as our entry into this world of voyeurism and obsession. By contrast, Madeleine is so calculatedly weird that the narrative purposely never allows one to get a handle on her solely so that Hitchcock can manipulate the viewer (and Scottie). After meeting Judy later on, Scottie turns into a rampaging and unlikable jerk. Judy clearly likes him, but balks at Scottie trying to turn her into a replica of a dead woman, and Scottie demonstrates no remorse about forcing this woman to bow to his will. Worse, we are made aware fairly early on and Scottie ultimately learns that there was indeed a well-orchestrated murder plot in play, yet both Hitchcock and Scottie seem completely unconcerned and ambiguous about justice for the victim or bringing the perpetrator to the law. Instead, Scottie (and Hitchcock by extension) seems far more obsessed with bullying and terrorizing the increasingly frightened Judy, who now elicits more sympathy than does the unbalanced unappealing Scottie.I also have a real problem with the conclusion. Even many of its most devoted fans will admit that the conclusion is unsatisfying, downbeat and absurd. The murder plot is not resolved at all. If the underlying theme is that all men are beasts underneath, then Hitchcock undermines that by taking too much delight in the psychological and physical abuse heaped on Novak's Madeleine and Judy characters. Perhaps we are to be impressed that Scottie's acrophobia is cured, but the fact that it takes a needless and ridiculously staged further death in order to cure it makes that a bitter victory - especially considering that Scottie lost our respect long ago so that few will even care.No - I have to say that Vertigo does not cut it as a classic. As for Hitchcock, Vertigo falls well short of some of Hitchcock's many lofty peaks. I would go so far as to say that it pales in comparison with Rear Window, Rebecca, North by Northwest, Psycho, Strangers on a Train, Shadow of a Doubt, The Lady Vanishes, The Birds, Foreign Correspondent, Saboteur, Spellbound, The Man Who Knew Too Much and Notorious.",Vertigo

James Stewart performance is very good. James Stewart plays a recently retired detective who just recently discovered he has a severe fear of heights and gets dizzy when approaching them. This is the result of a traumatic experience he had on the job. But he is assigned to observe a woman who is acting very strange according to her husband. Her husband claims she is possessed by her insane great-grandmother. During his investigation he see's how this could be true. Or it could just be a plot. He discovers more and more suspicious facts about the woman, but he also finds he is attracted to her. But this is just about halfway through the movie.

For me there are no weaknesses in the film and the cast and crew were clearly all on top form when it was created. I am not interested in the politics surrounding the film as to who may have been in what part and why the film did not fare well financially, the ones who were involved should have been congratulated for a job well done. For me the film has the stamp of brilliance on it from one of the greatest directors and the end result is like velvet. I very rarely single anyone out for praise no matter how good I think the performances were but if you watch this film pay particular attention to James Stewart and Kim Novak. They are both quite breathtaking for reasons you will become aware of during the film. The directors attention to detail is one of his trademarks and as far as I can see does not short change the paying public. What the viewer sees is not what real life was like in 1958 or any other year for that matter. What the viewer will see is a very entertaining experience which engulfs you from the start and I suspect most people will regard the two hours they have spent watching the film as being extremely enjoyable.",Vertigo
387,middleburg,Ravishing,10,18 July 2006,"What an extraordinary experience it is to see this movie in the cinema. Having scene the film as a youngster on an old black and white TV set sitting on a couch with a bunch of young cousins, we were all transfixed. I remembered the story line and the disorienting experience, and how captivated I was by the mystery story for years. I remember that we had to leave my aunt and uncle's home before the final twist of the film was revealed--and I made my aunt promise to watch the film and let me know how it ended. Well, she obviously didn't see the film, as I called her up when we got home, and she told me that the man and woman fell in love and the movie ended with them nice and happy!! So for 30 years, that's how I thought Vertigo ended. Then in the early 1980's I saw the film in its famous re-release as it was garnering its new found critical and commercial acclaim, in all its glorious color, with a New York City audience laughing and clapping and getting so amazingly caught up in this grand cinematic experience. It was, simply put, awesome!There are scenes in this film that are so unique, so surprising , that they genuinely take the breath away. The two shots of Madeleine, as a beautiful goddess-like figure in Ernie's restaurant, viewed from Scotty's perspective in the distance, then up-close as she glides by as if in a dream; the shot of Madeleine reappearing after Scottie's initially humorous, but then uncomfortably obsessive make-over, filmed in a glowing, hazy light, with Bernard Herrmann's ravishing film score welling up in waves of sonorous passion; the surprisingly long sequence without almost any dialog in which Scotty trails Madeleine, containing one gorgeous moment after another - the back-door opening up onto the kaleidoscopic colors of the flower shop, the mysterious silence in the grandeur of the museum; the gorgeous views of San Francisco - the monuments, the colors, the vistas; the truly dreamlike scene in the middle of the towering, dark redwoods; and that vision of the Golden Gate Bridge where Scotty ""saves"" Madeleine - it took truly masterful film-making to take an iconic American image, and present it on screen in such a spectacular and unique manner. But the film is not merely a ""museum film"" where art direction and cinematography are the most important element. In Vertigo, the story is a ""page turner"". We are watching each of the characters, absolutely fascinated with the twists and turns that abound. The engaging humor, the riveting suspense, the intriguing story line all stem from the manner in which Hitchcock presents the three main characters: - the physically and psychically crippled hero of James Stewart, the enigmatic, but unbelievably alluring heroine of Kim Novak, and the adorable, humorous, lively, human and humane Barbara Bel Geddes - we care deeply for all three of them, tangled in this complex spiral of inevitable sadness and tragedy.

388,Dark Eye,The Greatest Movie Of All Time,10,21 March 2000,"In my opinion, Vertigo is absolutely the best.  Few movies can compare to this work of genius, and mere words of praise alone cannot do justice. Alfred Hitchcock has truly created a classic cinematic work of art that needs to be experienced to be believed.This movie deals with the theme of obsession.  The story involves an acrophobic detective John ""Scottie"" Ferguson (James Stewart) who is hired by a friend to investigate on his mysterious wife Madeleine Elster (Kim Novak). After John rescues her from a suicidal leap into the bay of the Golden Gate bridge, he finds himself becoming obsessed with her.  Further plot entanglements ensues, resulting in one of the most fascinating and chilling mystery stories ever told.  The ""Master of Suspense"" certainly lived up to his nickname.  Vertigo also contained some of the best acting I have ever seen.  There is so much intense psychological agitation between Stewart and Novak.  Both actors are simply amazing in portraying their characters with very complex feelings for each other.  The beautiful Kim Novak had a dual role, and gave the best performance in the movie.  Novak is so haunting, melancholy, and full of mystery because she gave an intelligent and subtle performance.  In certain moments of the movie, her characters are truly heartwrenching.The movie is completed and perfected by the score of the legendary Bernard Herrmann.  I cannot stress enough on how important his music is to the emotional impact of Vertigo.  The scores range from uneasy agitation to sumptuously romantic with a haunting, dark foreboding tone to it.  Vertigo simply won't be the same without Herrmann's music.  The crafty use of exuberant colors as symbolic representations throughout the movie is also very clever.Vertigo is a film so passionate, the whole experience blows my senses away and lingered in my mind for a long time.  I have watched it again and again only to find myself becoming mesmerized all over again in a world of obsession.  Vertigo is most definitely Alfred Hitchcock's greatest achievement ever.",Vertigo

390,oyason,Midge is going to be bringing Scotty crayons for a long time,10,10 August 2008,"Alfred Hitchcock's VERTIGO is one of the greatest suspense films ever made. The director was at the top of his form with this work, which highlights intimate obsession bordering on necrophilia, which is a theme unusual in the time and place this movie was produced ( a U.S. studio in the late 1950s),but also Hitchock's amazingly ghoulish humor.Scotty Fergusen (Jimmy Stewart) is a private investigator who is recently retired from the city police force over an incident on the job that resulted in the death of a colleague and a pronounced fear of heights in Fergusen. Scotty is financially independent and has some support in the friendship of his confidant and former fiancé' Midge (Barbara Bel Geddes). His life and what's left of his emotional stability begin to be challenged when he is contracted by wealthy shipping magnate Gavin Elster (Tom Elmore) to track the doings of his wife Madeleine (Kim Novak), who has developed an obsession with the history of a tragic ancestor that now borders on the fantastic and suicidal. Or so Scotty is led to believe. What follows from the investigation is a star-crossed romance which assumes a surreal and sometimes folkloric dimension from the get-go, and which culminates in a post-mortem fantasy that will immolate not only Scotty, but the fortunes of working girl Judy Barton (Kim Novak in an interesting role within a role).If you've not seen this film, I will only tell you that Hitchcock demonstrates the truth of his masterful reputation as a movie maker through a precipitous wrap-up that left me crying I was laughing so hard, but I'm pretty twisted. All I'm going tell you is that I can't believe he got away with that back in 1958, and that in whatever realm the creatures of imagination reside, Midge is going to be bringing Scotty crayons to play with for a long time.By far and away, this one easily rates for me as one of the best films overall ever made, and if you like classic suspense film from the greats, this is one you can't miss.

I made a small attempt to catch up on what I missed while I napped, and when the film ended I was not too impressed. Because of that, it has taken me some time before I decided to give this film another chance.  Thank god I did.  The first thing I realized is that you have to pay attention when you watch this film because it isn't lite viewing.  The characters have a lot of depth and if you don't pay attention you might miss it.  That would be a tragedy because then you wouldn't get to fully experience the absolutely stellar performance by Novak, and the even more stellar (and extremely intense)performance of Stewart.  Their chemistry is great, and it made for a very rewarding viewing experience.The film is also quite lovely to look at.  Much like 'To Catch a Thief', the cinematography is excellent.  The sights are as much of the film as the performances.  There is also a great dream sequence, kind of like the one you would see in 'Spellbound', in comparison.  The color scheme is well defined, in the movie as well as the dream sequence, and that is a large amount of reds and greens.  Of course the direction is excellent, and that is no surprise.  The first time I saw this film I hated it, the second time I loved it.  The story is simple enough, but the characters have a depth that isn't all that common in Hitchcock movies.

400,AdFin,Must we all fall before we awake?,8,23 February 2002,"REVIEW CONTAINS MILD SPOILERS The problem with Vertigo, is that it's neither one thing nor the other, unable to decide what it wants to be.  We open as a detective story, an American detective story, as there is never a trace of noir, but slightly removed from reality, more so than the usual detective story, in a way that everything about the world in which the characters inhabit has an odd sanitised look and feeling, as though there is never any real danger around the corner.  The same thing could easily be applied to Hitchcock's other classic Rear Window, in which besides from the ominous threat of the man across the way, we never had any other worry for L.B. Jeffries.  In Vertigo the lead character is Scottie Ferguson (James Stuart), a detective hired by an old friend to keep a trace on his wife who he believes has been acting irrationally.  Scottie obliges, but pretty soon begins to develop an unhealthy obsession with the woman.  Hitchcock masterfully layers his subtexts and dreamscapes into his dense visuals, but the crux of the story only becomes more misguided.  We are torn somewhere between detective story and avant-garde psychological drama.The plot becomes more complex as we move along, with the kind of twist a-minute scenarios that modern audiences have come to expect, as Scottie is lead deeper into a web of mystery and deceit he has no chance of controlling.  There are many varying interpretations of Vertigo, most of which only thicken the plot more.  There is of course the irrational idea that Scottie dies during the opening leap across the building, or that he is fatally wounded, and the entire film unfolds like a dream, rapidly becoming a nightmare, but this variation only makes the ending of the film seem flawed.  For this to work, the dénouement would need to be less vague, although the idea of the nun brings a nice touch about Scottie confronting his faith, and his run up the steps of the tower becoming an almost allegorical riff on the old stairway to heaven motif, as the wounded Scottie slips from this world into death.  But like I said, it only raises unnecessary complications.  This idea also fails to give insight into Scottie's mental breakdown, if this is a dream, or some kind of life or death situation, then what would be the point of it.Hitchcock's imagery is as much a part of the film as the complex plot, as I mentioned before his composition and iconography layers false dreams and false realities, within the subconscious of the character.  Is it Scotties point of view we are seeing or Madeleine/Judy (Kim Novak)?  We are never sure of anything in the world of Vertigo, so we the audience must create our own false realities behind the film, to lull us into thinking we have a grasp on the proceedings, but we never fully will.  This is were the dream logic comes into play, the idea that we never fully awake from a dream until we fall, much like Judy's character at the end of the film, have we been viewing the proceeding through her eyes?  Who knows, much like a dream, Vertigo is a film that will never be understood, and despite some minor nagging flaws, it's better to just enjoy it whilst it lasts.",Vertigo
401,Redcitykev,"Superb yes, but a masterpiece?",8,29 May 2011,"For many years this film has been seen not only as the best Hitchcock film, but amongst the best American films of all. I have seen the film on many occasions, but have never really quite understood the fuss. tonight I watched a DVD of the restored version of the film and without doubt my opinion of it has changed. Maybe it is because I am older, seen more films, lived more life or whatever, but I now appreciate the psychological aspects of the film - obsession, manipulation, fear, love etc, and how Hitchcock's use of colour, deep focus, high angles etc etc are all used to superb effect to enhance the difference moods throughout the film.Having said all that the film still, for me, falls short of true greatness for a number of reasons. 1/ Just how does Scotty get down from the roof right at the very start of the film? 2/ What happens to the Barbara Bel-Geddis character - she just disappears once Scotty has been released from the hospital. 3/ Why (although the reason may be obvious) does Scotty not take Madeline to the hospital after she has been in the 'Fresco Bay instead of taking her to his apartment. 4/ When we see Madeline fall from the bell tower she is going feet first, yet when we learn the truth of what happened she is thrown off head first. Now, all these may be seen as myself being too 'picky', but such things do, for me, stop the film from crossing over from a superb piece of film making into a 100% solid gold masterpiece.One final thought. I watched the film via the restored version on DVD, and I have to say that the restoration is fantastic! Plus, on the region 2 version at least, there is an excellent 30 minute documentary on how the film was restore which is well worth watching.",Vertigo

404,johcafra,"As I Grow Old, Part 2",10,27 June 2009,"For reasons pretty much spelled out in my review of The Bridge on the River Kwai, this is another film that I appreciate more with age.I can be succinct about this. James Stewart's performance is his best. His character's obsession, whether or not you think it the result of unconscious seduction, is made all the more gripping because we are so much more accustomed to his portraying characters who are direct, purposive, honest and forthright. In a sense Scottie is...until he isn't.Kim Novak is, simply put, beautiful to the point of unearthliness. But this triangle has four sides, and Barbara Bel Geddes is also very much the player. She too is beautiful...or at least given her profession you get the idea she full well knows how to judge beauty...yet she cannot possibly compete with Scottie's fixation, which makes her recognizing that all the more painful and the instant focus of our sympathy.Where does age come in? How readily each of us can place ourselves in each character's shoes. The smug would doubtless think, ""You can't always get what you want,"" but how long did it actually take each of us to learn that? Not only the players but Hitchcock himself had to have known and understood that, and in his peerless directorial fashion he enhanced the portrait, adapting even the surroundings to suit. To me the plot is at times but a contrivance...until the very end.A postscript concerning Bernard Herrmann's musical score: Get a good recording and play the opening theme at theater volume without any visuals or even an attempt to recall the Saul Bass title sequence. In fact, darken the room you're in or listen at night. The music throbs and pulsates. Brilliant.",Vertigo
405,rcastl2335,"A ""masterpiece"" of goofiness",1,24 August 2021,"The story is that Hitchcock blamed the failure of Vertigo on James Stewart's age. What he should have blamed was a monotonous, nearly wordless script that had Stewart glooming around San Francisco for over 2 hours. As to the famous twist involving Kim Novak, the less said the better. It's not so much a twist as a full header into an empty swimming pool. Any critic who deems this a masterpiece should be condemned to 5 years of reviewing Will Ferrell movies exclusively.",Vertigo
406,keith-moyes,Not a masterpiece,3,18 June 2008,"Vertigo divides audiences more than any other Hitchcock film.For one critic it is ""one of the four or five most profound and beautiful films the cinema has yet given us."" A poll of 150 international critics has three times voted it the second greatest movie ever made (after Citizen Kane). However, many viewers find it a crashing bore.I have sympathy for both camps.Vertigo is the film in which Hitchcock comes closest to dealing directly with his own personal demons. The surface story makes no sense by itself and only works if you respond to the powerful undercurrents in its subtext. But Hitchcock still has to get the surface story right. It must fully embody the subtext and engage with its audience. For many people, it doesn't quite do either.The prologue leaves Scottie hanging over an abyss. By not showing his rescue, Hitchcock effectively leaves him hanging there for the rest of the movie and his vertigo becomes a metaphor for his spiritual condition; he is poised between a longing for life and a longing for death. In rejecting the (real) life-affirming Midge and in his infatuation with the (illusory) death-obsessed Madeleine, he makes his fateful choice.However, the prologue also supports a literal interpretation of his vertigo and the next scene doesn't really establish that Scottie's problems go deeper than his understandable fear of heights. We learn that he and Midge were once lovers but there is no follow through that explains why he broke off the relationship or why he becomes besotted with what we later learn is just a fantasy women.The next scene, with Elster, is even more unfortunate and its defects reverberate throughout the movie. Elster could have been depicted as a sort of Mephistopheles, who sees Scottie's weakness and tempts him to his doom. In fact, he is thinly-sketched and is just a device for kicking off the story.More crucially, he tells Scottie too much about Madeleine's obsession with Carlotta. This virtually forces Scottie into being the level-headed sceptic and makes his subsequent neurotic behaviour even more arbitrary and difficult to believe. It also undermines the ten-minute wordless sequence of Scottie trailing Madeleine around San Francisco.If Elster has simply asked Scottie to investigate his wife's aimless wandering, we would have started out expecting something mundane (like an affair) only to be drawn into the much more intriguing mystery of her identification with Carlotta and her apparent sleepwalk towards suicide. As it is, the sequence merely confirms what Elster has already told us and often tries the patience of the audience. For many, the picture never recovers.Moreover, because Scottie's character is under-developed (and Stewart's performance is unable to realise what the story implies) the rest of the movie can be viewed as the tale of an ordinary man who becomes infatuated with an attractive, troubled, woman whose life he has saved. The shadow of Carlotta then becomes an incidental detail and we get only a weak sense that Scottie's love is an unhealthy obsession. His eventual break-down is then under-motivated and seems imposed on the picture rather than being integral to its structure (a feeling reinforced by Hitchcock's decision to present it in an abstract, symbolic way).I don't view Vertigo in this way, but I can sympathise with those that do.With Scottie's breakdown, the picture reaches a second turning point. When Midge walks down the hospital corridor and the screen fades to black, it feels as if the movie is over. Of course it isn't and what happens next is crucial. Nothing up to that point makes any sense without it. But a second structural flaw immediately emerges. We are three-quarters of the way through the movie but only half-way through the story. Just when Vertigo needs time to re-engage our interest after the false ending it suddenly accelerates.We get a montage that establishes Scottie's continuing obsession with Madeleine, then he spots Judy, follows her home and we are immediately plunged into a flashback that 'explains' the plot. This meeting needed much better preparation and the subsequent relationship needed more time to develop.By revealing the plot twist so early, Hitchcock is inviting us to see how self-defeating Scottie's neurotic behaviour really is: in recreating Madeleine he is inevitably destroying his own illusions. But he rushes through this process. We have no time to get to know the real Judy before we are confronted with Scottie's bizarre plan to transform her. Then, at the very moment the transformation is complete, Scottie immediately spots the deception so the picture gallops to its climax and then slams to a halt.As a good professional, Hitchcock was wary about letting any of his pictures run over two hours, but if he wanted to impose this discipline on himself, then he should have been more ruthless in pruning the first half of the story. In fact, he should have just accepted that this story couldn't be told effectively in two hours and have let it run on longer.We rightly admire Hitchcock's movies for their great set pieces, but tend to overlook their fragile story sense and relatively weak dramatic structure. Mostly, that didn't matter, but in an ambitious picture like Vertigo it is a fatal flaw.There is much more to Vertigo than its detractors acknowledge, but it is far from being the near-perfect masterpiece that its most fervent admirers would have us believe.",Vertigo
407,guskeller,An all time great,10,14 October 2021,"Vertigo is one of Alfred Hitchcock's best films and one of the greatest movies of all time. Its most noticeable strength is the use of vibrant color, which Vertigo wields to convey themes of lust, death, and guilt. The cinematography continues with complex arc shots and dolly zooms that are utilized throughout. Meanwhile, more subtle framing compositions are consistently setting up mysterious tones and motifs surrounding obsession. However, Vertigo is far more than just its visuals.Vertigo is also masterfully written. The story starts as a simple thriller but develops thoughtful purpose. Opposing forces like fear/attraction, passion/death, repetition/distortion are explored in concise yet elusive ways. The music ties this together with ethereal yet uneasy melodies, fitting perfectly because it nails the sensation of disoriented freefall (both physically and mentally). Additionally, the special effects evoke a surreal atmosphere. Matte paintings and rear projections give this intimate story a grander feel. Throw in a trippy dream sequence that is a flavorful departure from the film's meticulous pace, and we have a wholly impactful experience. All told, it is clear why Vertigo is considered a masterpiece and still influential today.Writing: 10/10

Surprisingly enough, it works, in large part through the director's mastery over the medium. Some speculate that it was a highly personal project for him, a casting out of his own internal struggles. Such theories validity is questionable, but anyone watching will notice the movie's much lesser degree of calculating, joyful logic that almost all other Hitchcock's works are saturated with. Incredibly true to its title, by virtue of an eerie score and some dizzying cinematography, the movie induces the sense of romantic vertigo in the audience.

It stars James Stewart as a man who has vertigo, a phobia of some sort which makes him scared of heights. he is assigned by a friend to watch his wife (Kim Novak) who he believes is haunted by ancestral ghosts. Stewart falls in love with her but she dies on him. Distraught, he finds another girlfriend and tries to recreate Novak's appearance as closely as possible. Kim Novak and James Stewart prformances are brilliant and Barbara Bel Geddes is amazing as Stewart's ex-lover midge. The only quibble I have for this film is that it is remarkably slow and at times dull. But it picks of at the last hour. Not the master of suspense best, but it rounds up his top five.

San Francisco feels fresh again.Excellent character development... maybe the best I've ever seen in a film.On the negative side:1. John Ferguson's infidelity - how distasteful.

415,fwmurnau,"Fascinating, personal, but not Hitchcock's finest",8,1 August 2004,"This is without question one of Hollywood's most beautiful and original films of the 1950s, but its thin story leads to some unevenness.The first half consists mainly of Stewart following Novak around San Francisco -- as another poster comments, ""I hope you like shots of people driving."" It's fairly mysterious and beautifully shot, but awfully leisurely. For once in Hitchcock (as sometimes in the work of younger directors like Scorsese and DePalma, who idolize this film) one feels there's more style here than substance.Hitchcock had a perverse love for process shots; luckily in this film they are first-rate. If the automobile process shots had been as bad here as in some of his pictures, the first hour of VERTIGO would have been hard to take.(Spoilers begin here.) Then there's the abrupt revelation to the audience of what's really been going on, handled a bit awkwardly by Novak having a sort of vision. There's Stewart's nightmare, which looks dated now. Then the film speeds through the Judy section to the exciting ending -- here the pace seems too fast, as it seemed too slow in the first half of the story.These quibbles aside, much of the film is truly brilliant. I don't understand why anyone complains about Novak's superb, tense, even profound performance. It may be the deepest female character, and performance, in any Hitchcock film. Every moment of it feels right and rings true in the film's dream-like context.James Stewart, one of Hollywood's finest leading men, outdoes himself here, taking his beloved ""everyman"" persona into dangerous new areas: naked anguish, self-torture, sadism. I can't think of a single Hollywood leading man today who could pull off such a risky, emotionally-exposed performance. The unexpected depth and perfection of Novak's and Stewart's performances are major reasons for this film's high rating.Overall VERTIGO is brilliant, a masterpiece, so it's easy to forgive Hitchcook for a few sequences that drag. Maybe the draggy pace even contributes to one's sense that the film is a vivid dream -- or a nightmare.",Vertigo
416,Teyss,Stuff dreams are made on... and nightmares,10,9 March 2016,"""Vertigo"" is generally considered as the finest movie of one of the greatest directors, ahead of other masterpieces such as ""Rear Window"", ""North by Northwest"", ""Notorious"", ""Rebecca"", etc. In the Sight & Sound poll 2012 (a reference worldwide survey issued every ten years), it is rated best film ever in front of ""Citizen Kane"". It has progressed consistently in the poll: not listed (1962), #12 (1972), #7 (1982), #4 (1992), #2 (2002). In itself this survey does not constitute an absolute value, however it provides a notion of the high esteem of many directors and professionals.The movie is based on a novel, ""D'Entre les Morts"" (The Living and the Dead) by Boileau & Narcejac written a few years earlier (1954). However the book just provides a simple frame: the film gives it an altogether superior dimension. Its technical qualities have frequently been analysed: I will summarise some. What is more interesting is the fascination it exerts on many viewers, probably linked to its dreamlike essence (see below).MASTERLY STYLE...First, the objective qualities. They override the seeming flaws, which turn off some viewers and might explain the fact the movie was a critical and commercial failure when it came out: the plot is hardly credible; Gavin's ploy is far-fetched; there are long silent sequences; Kim Novak is not entirely convincing as Hitchcock himself noted (although he was maybe trying to partly blame her for the failure). However all this is secondary compared to outstanding direction, image, music and themes. Hitchcock did not aim for a simple thriller since he gives away the ploy much before the end: his ambition was far greater.The movie plays on the concepts of repetition and duality, illustrating the mystery of Madeleine/Carlotta and the double life of Madeleine/Judy.
The movie has two distinct parts: before Madeleine's death (1h15) and afterwards (55').We go to the same places in each of the two parts: Ernie's restaurant, the flower shop, Dolores mission cemetery (the second time in Scottie's dream), the Palace of the Legion of Honor, Scottie's place, San Juan Bautista mission and its tower (with the same shots on the trees along the road, the second time darker).Scottie falls in his dream as the policeman did in the first scene, the latter fall looking fake as in a hallucination.There are two falls from the mission tower: the ""real"" Madeleine and Judy. There are hence two double falls in the movie: policeman/Scottie and Madeleine/Judy.Madeleine is sometimes reflected in mirrors and windows, notably the first time she appears at Ernie's.There are two paintings of Carlotta: the real one and the fake one Midge paints (a ""double duality"" since Midge represents herself as Carlotta).There are two hotels (McKittrick and Empire).""Don't be so motherly"", Scottie tells Midge; later on when he is in the hospital she says ""Mother is here"".Visually, this repetition is illustrated by the image of the circle: the eyes and shapes of the opening credits, the cross-section of the tree at Redwoods State Park, Madeleine's and Carlotta's hairdo, the flowers. A notable exception: the staircase of the all-important mission tower is square. This is not because Hitchcock composed with what was available since the mission actually has no such tower (the outside was post-synchronised with painting; the inside was a model): the tower is where events tragically come to an end; the square breaks the iteration of the circle.... AND UNIQUEAll this already composes a major picture; moreover, its fine blend of reality and hallucination generate a unique magnetism. ""Life is a dream"" (Calderón): no movie expresses this better than ""Vertigo"".There are obvious references: Madeleine tells about her nightmare and we see Scottie's.Many scenes feel dreamlike or, sometimes, nightmarish. Notably the opening scene, the two scenes in the tower and the trial (surprisingly situated on the spot of the accident), where the judge lambasts Scottie, completely overstepping his role: a typical nightmare situation where one is criticised without being able to answer. Ernie's is an unreal place with its red walls and its still atmosphere. When Scottie kisses Judy, the room turns around and we see the mission as in a daydream.Many scenes occur in San Francisco region landmarks (the many above-mentioned, Golden Gate bridge, Cypress Point, Palace of fine Arts), yet we see few people: it is as if Scottie dreamt these events in remarkable places and only focused on Madeleine and himself. Also, when Scottie follows Madeleine, many parts are silent as dreams frequently are.There are strange lightings as if reality were altered: when we first see Madeleine, the light become unusually bright; it gets surprisingly dark in the bookstore; the cemetery scene is hazy; when Judy ""reincarnates"" as Madeleine, she is surrounded by a green halo, looking like a ghost. Colours are voluntarily saturated throughout the movie. Another distortion happens when Scottie thinks he sees Madeleine at Ernie's after she died: it actually is Kim Novak but she is replaced by another actress as she comes closer.Herrmann's haunting music is almost hypnotic.Hence it feels as though we were in Scottie's brain: the film could be interpreted as Scottie's dream or subjective view partly deformed by emotion.
We constantly follow him with few exceptions.After Scottie leaves the hospital, we never see Midge again even though she was very present before: it is as if she were discarded by Scottie's obsessive search for Madeleine.We frequently see what he sees: he watches Madeleine, he follows her, he dreams, he feels ""vertigo"" (rendered by a special effect: the camera moves back while zooming in).Most of the above-mentioned image distortions occur precisely when he is most emotional: he sees Madeleine for the first time; he goes to the cemetery; he thinks the deceased Madeleine came back to Ernie's; he sees Judy as a reincarnation of Madeleine; he kisses her; he nightmares; he feels vertigo.EPILOGUELast, ""Vertigo"" is a metaphor about love.
In the first part, Scottie falls in love with Madeleine while she is playing a role. Do we love persons for what they are or for what we think they are?In the second part, he transforms Judy to have her look like Madeleine. Do we love persons only if they meet our desires?Judy complies because Scottie's happiness is more important than hers. Should we do anything to satisfy the person we love?Yet both forms of love (illusion and possession) lead to destruction. These metaphors are collateral but add to the substance of this incomparable movie.",Vertigo
417,DrewAlexanderR1,A Thriller for Today,9,13 August 2015,"Vertigo is one of the perfect examples of a film that will always stand the test of time and one that should never be remade. Alfred Hitchcock is a genius and has many excellent films under attached to his resume. Psycho is the one synonymous with his name but Vertigo is arguably his best directed piece. Scottie Ferguson (Jimmy Stewart) is a retired detective who dwells over a failed case. An old friend, Gavin Elster (Tom Helmore), goes to Scottie and asks him to investigate his wife, Madeleine Elster (Kim Novak), who he thinks is cheating on him. Scottie accepts with the hope this will allow him to put the past to rest, but it turns into a twisted obsession that engulfs him. This film was glossed over at the Academy Awards in 1959. But today the film will always stick out for its directing, the superb screenplay, and the amazing performance of Jimmy Stewart. These factors make this film a classic and give it top shelf status even still, today. Vertigo sets the bar for a lot of thrillers today and many directors and writers have taken lessons and paid homage to this film. If you haven't seen this film yet, don't read anything about it.

To date I have watched three Hitchcock movies: ""Rebecca"", ""The Birds"" and ""Psycho"". None of the three fulfilled my expectations: I see the modernity and sometimes brilliant solutions by the author, but they always felt overpraised to me. Maybe after ""Vertigo"" I'll have to watch them again and understand the depth I sensed in this one. Is it a mystery movie? Yes, but only on the surface. Like any masterpiece, this film has a number of levels of interpretation: the plain mystery, solved at 3/4 of the movie; Scottie's spiral into madness, man's need for control over life and death, the meaning of colour to address emotions. These are just a few examples of just how multifaceted ""Vertigo"" can be, evolving from the original script into a real work of art. This might very well be the best example to show how Hitchcock managed to craft popular movies with a (heavy!) authorial touch for those who can grasp it.I also loved James Stuart's performance from likableness, through catatonic depression into obsessive maniacal behaviour, and keeping a continuity in his character only the greatest actors can achieve.

422,bobm5508,"Deemed as great, I'll go with ....very good!",8,11 September 2010,"This film has been heralded as Hitchcock's greatest masterpiece, his most personal thriller and a major classic. Its even ranked in the IMDb top 50. That's all very impressive and while I can't say I don't like the movie, I'm not willing to get quite that giddy with praise. I just watched it again, the magnificently restored version, in Hi Def. That's also very impressive. So where does it fall short of its lofty historic ranking for me, hard to say without sounding awfully nit-picky. Maybe it is nit-picky. The lush San Fransico background is amazing. The artwork, the flowers, the surrounding architecture are dazzling. The award winning music score is perfect for 1958 and sets the movie's mood, which changes several times, in lush, often rousing tones. But........ the story, the pacing and even some of the casting has always left me cold. Hitchcock can play a scene for a long time, almost leisurely, to get a MOOD. In ""VERTIGO"" they are maddenly leisurely. And the premise of the possessed wife, the concerned husband, the off kilter damaged cop, the insurance con is downright goofy! Especially the race to leap off the building for a dramatic suicide. The part 1 love story can be bought (the con and all!), and well played by the two stars, but the part 2 love story is so dark and possessive that it has always smacked of mean spirited to me. Now the casting. Jimmy Stewart has never taken a false step, but at age 50, despite his perfectly coiffed toupee and heavy makeup still looks it. Kim Novak, despite the worst eyebrows in cinema history, is a ravishing early 20's and looks it. The fake and then real attraction to Stewart is hard to imagine. Especially when the apparently lonely (how could she be) and distraught Novak, who really loved Jimmy, has heaps of humiliation piled on her by the dark and damaged Stewart. It threw my ""suspension of belief"" off a bit. And the surprisingly attractive Barbara Del Geddes (pre-Dallas Matron) is supposed to be Stewart's old college chum!! He must have been post, post grad and she was Freshman. Hey, I said it was nit-picky!!I've read that the movie was actually poorly received and attended during its initial release. And that was at the height of Stewart's and Hitchcock's powers. The supreme inventive director of his day, he used interesting angles and zooming in and out cameras to get all his desired affects of vertigo. If there was better entertainment around in '58, with more star power, I'd be surprised, so why not a hit?? Were people nit-picky then too??",Vertigo
423,ken_bethell,"Nostalgic, nothing more",6,7 August 2012,"It was after I heard that Vertigo had replaced Citizen Kane as 'Best Movie of all Time' that I pondered as to whether I had actually seen this film. This was curious as I had no difficulty in remembering 'Kane' despite having only seen it once some 35 years ago. Since I could not recall missing any other James Stewart picture of that era or any of the other big productions of 1950s I assumed that I had seen it but would view it again. I watched it last night and my instincts were correct. I had forgotten this film because it is forgettable! In fact the only memorable thing about the film was the San Francisco skyline which had become beautifully enhanced by its conversion to BluRay. I have never been a great Hitchcock fan for the very reason that his films tend to be over-stylised and Vertigo is no exception. No great acting accolades either in fact dialogue seem to be a secondary consideration to the visual enactment of Stewart's character's mental decline. The film could easily have been a silent film. One critic commented on being fascinated by the complexity of this multi-layered psycho-drama. Uhmm, really. The ending was pure David Lynch - not difficult to see where he got his inspiration, but it was inadequate for a movie lasting beyond two hours. For lovers of this movie genre I would recommend 'The Woman in the Fifth'. Don't be put off by its low rating in IMDb. It is fine example Pawel Pawlilowski's direction and Ethan Hawke is excellent as the mentally-bewildered American adrift in Paris. Back to Vertigo and what more can I say? This film and others of its period have garnered praise well beyond their station by virtue of the current nostalgia boom. My criterion for deciding how good a film is is whether or not it stands the test of time - does it look dated? This film does, as does 'From Here to Eternity' but 'On the Waterfront' doesn't.It's purely personal of course.",Vertigo

During my first viewing of the film I was very surprise by the excellent mature and patient directing of Hitchcock,which was very different to the style that I had expected,due to seeing ""spoof"" versions of famous Hitchcock films,where they made it look as if the camera would find it impossible to stay in one place. Thankfully Hitch is actually the complete opposite,with only using shots of Fergusions Vertigo during moments where the character is at some of his weakest moments. Hitchcock also uses the camera to show the destructive breakdown for each of the characters,With the truly unforgettable dream sequence Hichcock does amazingly well at showing how much damaged Madeleine has done to Scotties mental state,although Hitch shows that Madeleine also has to pay a price,with a very daring ending,that probably most directors even now, would not choose.Whilst I heard a few years ago about the now mis-quoted infamous quote about how Hitchcock through actors should be treated,with this amazing film,I think that it is very easy to actually see that Hitchcock wanted to get the best performances from the stunning cast. With the sadly underrated Kim Novak giving an astonishing performance as ""Madeleine"",who she shows "" may"" be struggling with a personality disorder,which Novak excellently shows to be slowly bubbling over into her life.",Vertigo

That character, 'Scotty' Ferguson, leaves the police force due to a tragedy brought on by his condition, and becomes a private detective for an old friend. What seems like a simple task of following the man's beautiful wife, ends up nearly costing Scotty his sanity.  The film is one of blind obsession, and what people will do to fulfill those obsessions. Stewart, a Hitchcock favorite, is effective in the role of a regular man overcome by obsession and feelings of guilt, almost to the point of madness,  and Kim Novak is memorable in her complex dual roles.

The initial portion though holds the flavor of a thriller but I guess the main feature that a thriller becomes more and more nail-biting as you approach the end, was missing.

Barbara Bel Geddes is also quite a standout as Midge - that look she gives Jimmy when he says that SHE broke up with HIM - what the heck is that? I've never figured it out.It's almost as if Hitch wants the audience to suspect her, too! Stewart's much-debated age works for him, I think, adding a pathos that might otherwise not be there. Bel Geddes might have thought she had the confirmed middle-aged bachelor by default, and when he thinks he's found true love, it's rather pathetic how vulnerable he becomes.

430,Shilo_R_A,A Stunning Psychological Thriller,9,16 May 2021,"Now, that's an incredible psychological thriller. It's the first time I watch a film by Hitchcock, btw. I love so many things about it.Let's start with a summary: Vertigo is a kind of heavy dizziness, caused by various reasons. The main character of this film, John, suffers from Vertigo due to Acrophobia - fear of heights. John was a police detective, but due to his Vertigo a fellow cop fell to his death from a rooftop during a chase, trying to help John. Now a former detective, John is asked to follow a woman who seems to struggle with various mental issues...and that's about it. I can't really sum is better or give away more of the plot without spoiling it, but that's generally it.Vertigo is basically a technical masterpiece. Like it or not, on a technical level it's phenomenal - the score is so immersive and melancholic, the dialogue flows seamlessly, the actors are great and every scene is built in such a perfect way. You could take a screenshot of this film at a random moment, and like 90% of the times it would make an awesome poster or drawing. The plot has a good pacing overall, and I like the symbolism here a lot too. Falling is a main motive in this movie, and it's truly done in a brilliant way. I also find the plot captivating, and I was on the edge of my seat a lot of times while watching this film.The only problem that I have is really minor - in some scenes, especially near the end or outside, the lighting and the contrast seem weird a little bit. I later realized why is it that way and what it represents, but it still gives a weird vibe from time to time.To sum it up, this film is really good, and some scenes were done in such an amazing way that it was kinda shocking to think that it was done in the 50's. If you like thrillers, especially psychological thrillers, you'll definitely enjoy this one. Feeling a 9.2 on this one.",Vertigo
431,ericolsen1953,Why did this one flop?,10,14 September 2006,"Almost perfect suspense-flick, done by the master himself. And, a super music score by Bernard Herrmann. Both a leading man & lady who are just the right fit for their roles. Yet, Vertigo flopped at the box-office when first released in 1958. Maybe it was the cartoon scenes that Hitch tried out for the first time, and then dropped for good. Maybe some scenes dragged on too long, like the coroner's inquest. Other than those little criticisms, this film still does it for me. It's great fun watching Scottie (Jimmy Stewart) watching rich society-dame Madeleine (Novak) as she wanders about San Fran feeding her neurotic obsession with a long-dead ancestor. (San Francisco is always such an ideal venue for mysteries and dramas). After Scottie saves Madeleine's life once, he's unable to save it on a second suicide attempt and he goes into a deep funk, complete with Chuck Jones-style illustrations! What astounds most is Stewart recognizing Novak walking home to her rooming house after she'd died in a jump from a church bell-tower. Then, it's eerily fun as we watch Stewart acting really strange...we think he's going bananas, but in reality, his well-honed policeman's instinct is working behind the scenes all the time and he's several steps ahead of the audience until the last scene with a surprise ending.",Vertigo

The climax however does bring the disorder to the forefront of the movie, hence I would consider this a different kind of classic. Its not a usual Hitchcock movie where a movie breathes the theme for the whole 2 hour or so. Also this movie could have been edited a little better by chopping out some of the scenes where both the leads are just looking at each other sitting in the car with same expressions after every 10 minutes of the movie or just following cars etc. It's a world known fact that Hitchcock believed more in pictures than dialogues but in this movie, some scenes felt like a stretch. On the plus side of the movie was James Stewart and his ease with depicting each kind of emotion. In my opinion this was his best performance ever (even better than Rear Window) especially the passion he showed in kiss scenes, at his age are commendable. On the whole an 8 since the quality of a Hitchcock was still maintained its just that it was in different-than-usual areas this time.",Vertigo
434,john_seater,"Slow, boring, ridiculous, and predictable",1,18 November 2015,"I finally watched this old chestnut. I read somewhere that it was a flop when it came out but later became recognized as a classic. Apparently Alfred Hitchcock blamed James Stewart's being too old for the part. The two never worked together again. Well, Stewart wasn't the problem. The problem was the script, which is simply asinine. The public was right the first time: the movie is terrible.The hero falls in love with a woman who is supposed to be nuts and who gives him no reason at all to fall in love with her. She has a few mad scenes with him but never engages in any conversation of any substance on any topic, never does any activities with him, etc. On top of that, she is his old friend's wife. Her only attraction is that she is good looking, but lust for a pretty woman isn't love, which is what the hero is supposed to feel. Totally implausible.The movie runs 2 hours. There is a great deal of boring driving around San Francisco and the nearby California coast in the first half of the movie. I started looking at my watch at around 1:15 into the movie. Was this thing ever going to end? At about 1:30 the main plot is revealed. It is pretty silly and quite routine. The remaining 1/2 hour is torture. The plot gets more and more ridiculous, all the while getting more and more predictable. My impatience got more and more intense. When the truly idiotic end finally came, I was both relieved (over at last!) and outraged (what a waste of 2 hours).",Vertigo
435,panchodh_12,Unforgettable,9,22 May 2015,"This movie is amazing. I wouldn't dare to blatantly say it is Hitchcock's masterpiece only because Psycho is pretty good to, but it definitely competes for the prize. There's very few movies that made me shout and stay on the edge of my chair for so much time as this one, the whole atmosphere, starting from the opening credits, is creepy as f*ck. And it just keeps building up until the suicide which, you think, it is the climax of the movie. Then, surprisingly, the movie doesn't seem to finish. At first I was quite bothered, why would the movie not finish yet? Yes, the scene in which Scottie has that weird, LSD-like dream is pretty awesome, but it just seemed to me that Hitchcock was stretching the movie too much. Until you realize that you didn't see it all, and that the woman who fell from the tower is not the woman Scottie fell in love with (is it not? who did he feel in love with exactly?). Then it just gets way to f*cked up. And Scottie begins to be a creep with Judy, and you just wish that nothing happens to her. And tension begins to build up again, and you just can't stand it anymore, up until the last scene, which oh god I will never forget. The shadow in the end shall haunt me in my dreams for many nights to come. It definitely ranks among the best final scenes I've ever seen (Psycho's climax is also pretty high up there, too, though it's not exactly the last scene). So yeah, this is among the best thrillers I've seen in my life.",Vertigo
436,willwoodmill,Alfred Hitchcock's magnum opus,10,16 February 2016,"Alfred Hitchcock was a creative genius, he was able to play his audience like a piano. Few people have done so much developing the cinematic language as Alfred Hitchcock, he had so many experimental and original ideas, like shooting one film in one long uncut shot, (Rope) or having the whole film take place in one room. (Rear Window) But his greatest contribution to film is easily Vertigo, and Vertigo is one of the best films ever made. Vertigo is about a retired detective John 'Scottie' Ferguson (played by Hitchcock favorite, Jimmy Stewart in probably his second best performance), who has a crippling fear of heights after a near death experience. One day Scottie is contacted by an old friend of his, this friend is the head of a major shipping company, and hires Scottie to follow his wife. Not because he suspects her of cheating, he makes that very clear to Scottie, but because she has been acting strange going out on long drives and then not being able to tell him were she went. Scotties friends wife, Madeleine Elster, is played by Kim Novak, who does on excellent job as a classic Hitchcock blonde. As Scottie continues to investigate this strange case, he discovers an unsettling story as he falls in love with her.Vertigo is based of a French novel called, D'Entre Les Mortes, or The Living and the Dead, written by Boileau-Narcejac the French writing collaboration, that wrote the book that the film Les Diaboliques, and wrote the screen play for the film Eyes Without A Face, both of which are fantastic films that I highly recommend you check out, but neither of those are as mind-blowing as Vertigo. The story structure is very similar, but what gives Vertigo its edge is Hitchcock's flawless direction, he knows how to perfectly direct the cast, and control what the audience is seeing. But Hitchcock is not the only one who knocks it out of the park in Vertigo, Vertigo is a tour de force, every single member of the cast and crew is giving the best they got, the cinematography done by Robert Burks (who collaborated with Hitchcock several times) is mind-blowing and even invented the famous ""Vertigo shot."" The score done by Bernard Hermann (who scored some of the best films of all time like Citizen Kane, and Taxi Driver) may just be the greatest film score ever, I highly recommend you listen to it separate from the film some time because it can stand on its own, but even with how great the score is, Hitchcock was smart enough to not use it in certain scenes, like climax, it would just be an unneeded edition. As the film progresses the audience begins to learn about why Madeleine Elster acts the way she does, the more disturbing the film becomes, I won't spoil what's going on, but it is incredibly creepy and executed in such a way that it is guaranteed to send shivers down your spine. Probably the scariest part in the film is a montage, dream sequence that takes place 2/3s of the way through the film, this dream sequence gave me nightmares the first time I saw it, and still does every time I re-watch Vertigo. When you talk about ""the greatest films of all time"" Vertigo is often mentioned in that conversation. And in the 2012 sight & sound poll (the best film poll in my opinion) Vertigo kicked Citizen Kane out of the first place spot, this is the first time this has happened in the 60 years that the poll has been taking place. And while I don't think it's better than Citizen Kane it's hard to get mad when it's replaced with such a great, influential, important film. This whole review I've been struggling to put just how good Vertigo is, into words. But I don't think anyone ever could. It's a film that is so very deep, complex, and original that you would need to go through the whole film shot by shot, frame by frame, (Roger Ebert actually did this) before you could really describe it. No matte how many times you watch you will always discover something new about it. It is a film that feels like you're watching it for the first time, every time you re-watch it. Vertigo is one of those films that I wish I could give an 11/10, but unfortunately IMDb doesn't give me that option, so I guess I won't.10/10",Vertigo
437,carlgt1,A great movie with just a flaw (IMHO) in the love story.,9,26 February 2001,"This is a great movie and an excellent example of the masterful Hitchcock touch.  Some of the cut scenes, the photography are really landmarks in film.  My favorite is when Scottie is in the hotel room with the girl embracing, the camera moves around them; the livery stable scene is in the background, then we're back to the hotel room.  I'm not so sure it's worthy of being #29 at IMDB.  But it is pretty darn good how the writers & Hitchcock were able to blend the supernatural element (through the story line as well as the cinematography) with the logical explanation at the end (sort of an uber-Scooby Doo episode ;-).I give it a 9 out of 10, just losing a point because I wasn't convinced by what seemed to be the rushed love interest with Scottie & Madeleine at first.  Would such a stand-up guy like Scottie be making out with his old college pal's wife after what seemed like two days of tailing here?  And it seemed a bit rushed or forced in the followup pursuit of Judy.  I suppose this rushed love interest was a necessary evil as the film would be 4 hours long if it developed normally?  And poor Midge seemed to be a pretty useless character.  But these are minor gripes overshadowed by the otherwise great story, photography, & direction by Hitchcock.",Vertigo
438,SanTropez_Couch,"Good, but the greatness eludes me.",7,11 April 2003,"The greatness of this film eludes me. It's certainly a good film, and I liked it, but whatever element this film has that makes it any better than the rest of Hitchcock's movies remains unseen by me. To be honest, the only idea that makes me value it any more than a standard Hitchcock thriller is its honesty -- that Jimmy Stewart's controlling nature over Kim Novak parallels Hitchcock's own controlling nature over his actresses.The most thrilling moment of the entire film, for me, was the opening credits, with those classic spirals and the first hint of Bernard Herrmann's great score.The story is simple: a cop (Jimmy Stewart), after watching one of his buddies fall to his death, contracts vertigo and acrophobia and leaves the force. Then, one day, when an old school friend calls him to keep an eye on his wife (Kim Novak) who's been acting strangely, believing she's someone else, he gets involved once more. Stewart falls in love with Novak, whom he saves from drowning in the San Francisco Bay, but her aloof nature and apparent psychological damage prevents her from returning the love.Then something happens that would be criminal to give away.I just don't see what makes this movie great, or stand out among Hitchcock's other work. Is it really because it's so personal? Maybe there's something I'm missing, maybe there are subtleties placed throughout the film that I didn't get and that I've completely misunderstood the point of the movie. As far as I can see, though, the film's ""complex"" message is that love is either one big trick or a perverted obsession. (Either that, or I'm forced to venture desperately into dream territory: ""Oh, you know, everything after so-and-so was a dream, and that, therefore, makes the movie real complex."")I admire the film's craft, and I didn't find it boring or anything, but I was expecting something very complex, much more than this. I also felt for the heartbroken Stewart, as well as the Midge character, his admirer. I could also sympathize with Novak's character, as she's manipulated by Stewart.Aside from the opening credits, which I adore, my favorite part of the movie may well be the restaurant where we first see Novak. That incredibly red room must have influenced Peter Greenaway when he made ""The Cook, The Thief, His Wife, and Her Lover."" There are also a few camera moves that are nice, and thanks to the terrific transfer, the colors, images, and sounds (which are essential to the film's appeal) are impeccable.While I want to understand what it is people feel that makes them call this movie great, and I'll see it again sometime, I'm not going to re-watch it just so I can ""get"" it. I'm generally not a fan of re-watching movies to discover their greatness -- I find most people who do that are, in effect, lying to themselves the second time, convinced that they ""get"" it. I hate to be part of the dissent, especially when favorites of mine like ""Fargo"" have an equally enthusiastic following that denounces them as completely unexceptional. But as it stands, this movie is just a well-crafted, more-personal-than-usual thriller.***",Vertigo

I can see - sort of - how the novel may have convinced us that the hapless vertigo-guy may not have recognized the ""dead"" girl when he saw her again on the street. (I'll concede that coincidence, but this, too, is a stretch.) But Jimmy Stewart fawning all over the ""resurrected"" Kim Novak (new clothes, new hair) is so laughable it's embarrassing. Stewart is terribly miscast here. He looks like a doting father helping his clueless teenage daughter get ready for the prom. (When I watched the video with a group, there were lots of ""grandfather"" jokes, too.)

The pursuit is too difficult, one of the detectives slips and hangs on for his life. The other detective tries to help him and in so doing ends up falling to his death. Haunted by his own sense of inadequacy and guilt and now suffering from vertigo as a result of the incident, the surviving detective, Scottie Ferguson, retires. That is until he is unofficially brought back into commission by an old school acquaintance. He is now charged with spying on his old acquaintance's wife, Madeleine Elster, who is believed to be becoming possessed by a ghost from her past. This ghost is based on a real woman who died tragically at a young age: she was Madeleine's grandmother. If the possession is real then the woman's life could be in imminent danger, if it is not then there is a deep mystery to unfold. The stakes are raised particularly high because Scottie is falling in love with Madeleine, he has become profoundly drawn into her world, he has become obsessed by her preternatural beauty and ethereal charm. It is now not only her future that he is fighting for but also his own.This film is a miraculous achievement for a number of reasons: firstly, the film looks beautiful, shot in startling technicolour the rich, vibrant colours radiate from the screen, there are sumptuous, deep hues, subtle, smoky emerald greens and even a hauntingly fascinating animated scene part-way through the film. Kim Novak, who plays Madeleine, is shot with such reverence that one can not help but be fascinated by her, she is lit in a way which demonstrates her alluring beauty but there is something unnatural in the lighting, making her seem unobtainable, almost phantasmagoric. The film is a technical marvel, innovating a zoom in, zoom out technique known as ""the vertigo effect"". The acting is superb, James Stewart was one of the best and Novak plays both restrained elegance and street-wise vulnerability unerringly brilliantly. But what really sets this film out among the rest is its atmosphere, it flickers and bristles with intrigue and ambivalence at every turn, you're never quite sure where the film is leading you, and you're willingly taken on a deep, complex psychological journey. A major contributor to this atmosphere is the score, by Bernard Herrmann, it is a haunting, Wagnerian powerhouse which runs alongside the majestic, transforming imagery and imbues its audience with an experience of pure immersion. As I said, quite simply, a miraculous achievement.",Vertigo
442,kmberger,One of the master's best.,10,4 December 2002,"Hitchcock has made some flashier films (The Birds, Psycho) and some more technically proficient films (Notorious, Rear Window), but in many ways, Vertigo is one of his absolute best.*Possible spoilers*Jimmy Stewart turns in a performance that at first glance looks like one of his standard Everyman Hero roles of the day.  However, Scotty Ferguson is anything but that - he's a man who becomes consumed by love, lust and obsession.  He finds himself drawn to Madeleine (Kim Novak), only to lose her just as he's falling in love with her.  The only thing to draw him out of his depression is Judy (Novak again), a lookalike for Madeleine. Scotty proceeds to make her over into his dead love in a creepy descent into madness where reality and fantasy no longer have any distinction for him.'Vertigo' is a film that holds up quite well after 44 years.  Yes, the pacing is a little slow, especially in the first half of the film.  But that's a deliberate choice.  Hitchcock was clearly capable of ramping up the action in other films; 'Vertigo' doesn't need that.  Scotty's mental state is best shown as a slow spiral, and it is even more disturbing on repeated viewings. This film has been described by other comments as 'dreamlike'.  I'd agree with that.  Bernard Herrmann's excellently haunting score; a script that is light on dialogue and heavy on imagery; and Stewart's rock-solid performance give 'Vertigo' a depth to the suspense.  It's a nightmare and a fantasy at the same time.  'Vertigo' is a classic of American cinema.  Even after four decades, it still has something to say about the nature of love and obsession.  And it's brought to you by the master of suspense.  Nearly flawless. 10/10.",Vertigo

444,EdwardCarter,Awful garbage,1,4 March 2011,"The use of colour is probably the only good thing about this slow and boring, overlong, dated film. The first half is much too long and slow and the repetitive driving scenes quickly become very tiresome. Kim Novak was always a poor actress, and looks ridiculous with her bleached platinum blond hair and thick dark eyebrows. Far too many scenes take place in the studio on very fake looking sets with painted backdrops. The opening scene is ruined because it is so fake, not that cops would be chasing a criminal over rooftops anyway. By far the worst thing however is the dreadful miscasting of Grandfather Stewart as Scottie. Stewart was clearly far too old to be playing romantic leads at this point in his career and he was actually more than twice Kim Novak's age (she was 24 and he was 49, though he looked at least 55). His grey wig is laughably bad and he just looks like an ugly old man chasing after his granddaughter. With a younger, better looking actor like Marlon Brando the film might have at least been watchable.",Vertigo

446,felixoscar,My Personal Favorite - Dazzling and Incomparable,10,5 April 2003,"After watching movies for almost forty years (is that possible!), I wondered what might qualify as my personal favorite.  Sunset Blvd? Becket? Raiders of the Lost Ark? All About Eve? A Star is Born (37 version)? Dodsworth? Body Heat? Quite an eclectic mix, huh!Vertigo heads my personal list. And I remember when first (finally) seeing this, after several years of it being unavailable. WOW! But that was only the initial viewing, with the plot captivating me.  The movie had received only lukewarm reviews and was not considered top tier Hitchcock (perhaps this was in the early 1970's).Delighted that so many IMDB members, and critics too, have altered their opinions over the past 30 years.  Nice to be part of a majority for once LOLWhat dazzles me about Vertigo is virtually everything! This score was not even nominated for an Oscar (we play the soundtrack every few weeks). The photography, use of color, of one of the world's best looking cities. Costumes, everything is classy Hitchcock.I remember timing one of the early sequences, perhaps 5 full minutes go by without any dialog (guess Hitch wanted to briefly return to his early pre-talkie days!). I bet this movie would be quite a splendid experience to watch with the sound off!Ok, the story is fantastic (in all senses of the word).  But how did Hitch get Kim Novak to give this performance?But let's talk about James Stewart, to my mind, the most talented of all movie actors (not that Cary Grant, Edward G. Robinson and Jack Nicolson are not right up there as well).  Without repeating what everyone else has written, among the greats this is his greatest.Color, script, acting, mood, music, photography --- Hitch, thank you for this masterwork.  Hey, maybe we should watch it again tonite!",Vertigo
447,FinneganBear,Vastly overrated,5,31 December 2019,"I've always been a fan of Hitchcock. And I know Vertigo is considered a great classic. So I wanted it to truly impress me. Sadly, it did not. The plot is unbelievable and there are no sympathetic characters, least of all the usually amazing James Stewart.The plot set-up has Elster, an old friend of ex-detective Scottie (Stewart), hiring him to tail his wife Madeleine (Kim Novak) who seems possessed by a spirit. Scottie's idea of tailing a suspect seems to be to constantly follow directly behind her in his car. Apparently, she never looked in her rear view mirror to notice him. She appears to attempt suicide but Scottie rescues her and takes her to his home to recover where he immediately falls in love with her. She tells him she dreams of dying and later describes a dream about an old Spanish mission with a bell tower. Scottie knows the place she's describing and takes her there. She goes to the top of the tower and appears to fall to her death. Scottie leaves the scene as others rush to the body. Scottie plunges into extreme depression although Elster doesn't hold him responsible before moving to Europe. After treatment, Scottie begins to see Madeleine in the faces of every woman he sees. Then he just happens to notice another woman on the street one day (a contrived coincidence needed to push the plot along) who resembles Madeleine but with different hair. Scottie immediately becomes obsessed with this woman (called Judy) and she agrees to have dinner with him.At that point there is a very awkwardly timed flashback quickly explaining the mystery. Elster hired Judy to disguise herself as Madeleine and set up his old friend Scottie to follow the disguised Judy. When Scottie took the bait and drove Judy to the mission, Elster killed Madeleine and waited with her body in the bell tower so that he could toss her (dressed exactly like Judy) from it with Scottie (whose known fear of heights keeps him below) as a witness to her fall. Scottie left the scene, later alleging he blacked out) as others rushed to the body. Yet in another contrived plot device, Elster and Judy were able to come down from the tower and slip away unnoticed.Scottie immediately develops a creepy obsession with Judy because she reminds him of Madeleine. They begin dating but he demands she change her appearance to resemble Madeleine. Judy fell in love with Scottie while impersonating Madeleine so she goes along with his demands. But when he sees her with a necklace of Madeleine's, the former detective figures out what happened. But instead of going to the police, he takes Judy against her will to the mission and roughly forces her into the bell tower where she slips and falls to her death. Scottie looks down at the body as the film ends.So we have Elster, who is a murderer who escaped to Europe, Judy, who was his accomplice, and Scottie, who was in love with what he believed was Elster's wife and then became deranged and was responsible for dragging Judy against her will into the tower from which she fell. On the periphery is Scottie's friend and ex-fiance Midge who is clearly obsessed with him although it is superfluous to the plot.For some reason, Vertigo has become a classic and considered a great movie. But there are no sympathetic characters and the plot is unbelievable and requires contrived scenes to move it along. It's a movie everyone should see if only to judge for yourself if it lives up to the hype. So I rate it a 5. See it but without high expectations. I'm reminded of ""The Emperor's New Clothes, "" the fable about how everyone praised the emperor's clothes (even though he wore none) only because they heard everyone else doing it and felt they should do the same lest they appear wrong. After watching Vertigo, I think people praise it because they hear others praising it. But on its own merit, it is quite flawed.",Vertigo
448,charbelelaro,Simply incredible,9,4 April 2018,"Vertigo directed by Alfred Hitchcock is a crime drama which surrounds one retired detective who is asked to take on one last task. The task is to follow his college friend's wife due to her recent bizarre behaviour. And from that point the audience is taken on such a captivating and unexpected journey. Vertigo is simply incredible. Everything in the film is still outstanding. The cinematography, music, acting and script are some of the best ever. What I love particularly is how unpredictable it is. The movie takes such incredible turns, which really compels the audience even further. The sinister tone of the movie is so magnetic, as the feelings and emotions remain with you beyond the credits. The film ends with such a high, confirming why it is one of the most memorable movie experiences in history. My only issue is the first act, which at times can feel quite slow due to that fact that audience doesn't have that emotional attachment to the characters and story yet. Although the film progresses and builds brilliantly. Vertigo will forever be timeless so therefore I give it a 9.",Vertigo
449,prudhoeboy,SF Ghosts,10,12 September 2021,"I always get a bit of a creepy feeling when I visit San Francisco, an old Victorian era city with so many graveyards from past generations they had to move them to Colma. Even the homes look like tomb stones. Vertigo, perhaps Hitchcock's best work, takes full advantage of SF as a setting for this haunting story. Monuments from the past, museums, art gallery, Coit Tower, the Redwoods and many others are used to weave the plot through. This is the last look of SF before it went hippy and very liberal. Men wore suits and women dressed up. Anyway, this haunting, iconic movie is a classic and is an easy 10. The only criticism I have of the movie is that once again, Jimmy Stewart looks a bit old for the part. My gosh, he makes a big issue out of Kim Novaks hair color in the movie. He could use some rinse himself. The movie has him as a retired detective so it kind of covers that issue too.",Vertigo
450,Movieguy-47,Shock Time,10,31 July 1999,"This may come as a shock to some people reading this, but I'm quite a big Hitchcock fan and ""Vertigo,"" in my opinion, is not his best film. ""Rear Window"" is the finest feature he ever made, and ""Psycho"" was his most purely entertaining (although I would rank the famous horror film third, after ""Rear Window"" and ""Vertigo"").James Stewart plays a private detective who is hired to follow a beautiful blond (Kim Novak) whom he quickly falls in love with. She commit suicide (or did she?) and, later on in the film, the Stewart character finds the glowing image of her in an equally beautiful redhead. I won't give away anything else.Now don't get me wrong, ""Vertigo"" is a near-excellent film that I love and cherish. Most ""Vertigo"" detractors say the film can be seen from too many different points of views  (surreal dream, detective story, romance, etc.) and that is has no clear narrative flow. Actually, I like that aspect of the movie. My problem with ""Vertigo"" is a more primitive one; I just think the buildup to the blond's suicide is too long and worked up.

All I know is that 'Vertigo' manages to tell a side of humanity, in that we are all susceptible to becoming vulnerable in the general sense. We may have our strengths, but we will always have our weaknesses.Is there a lesson to be learned by any of this or do we just have to learn to live with this knowing that this type of ambivalence cannot be prevented all the time? Does 'Vertigo' answer any of this? I do not know if it does, but maybe you the viewer will think otherwise. Whatever you may be thinking about, 'Vertigo' is a film that every film lover should see. 'Vertigo' to me is a thriller that is very psychological in that it made me question a side of our humanity that plays a part in our interactions with people. Any story that can captivate me to a level beyond just being entertained for the sake of entertainment is the type of story I would definitely want to revisit again and again.",Vertigo

It is easy to see what is fascinating: the music by Herrmann the face of Jim Stewart the great sub plot with the down-to-earth friend Mitch played brilliantly by Barbara Bel-Geddes. (When I first saw it as an adult at the beginning of the eighties dozens of people started whispering ""Miss Ellie"" when she had her first scene.) Why did she end the engagement when she obviously still loves him? The thought of recreating your lost loved one. But at the same time the film is overlong (which is an euphemism for boring). You seem to see Stewart behind a wheel all the time. The plot seems to be too constructed. There is no hint of why in the world Judy should go through everything. Why not confess to John? So she started to love him only later? Why in the world should someone push a puppet down the staple? (Well, that was the troubling thought I had when I first saw the film as a kid. There should be a law against kids watching great movies. They have fun enough being kids and it spoils  the films for them when they watch them later.) Anyway I will watch it again and find out what makes this one ultimately a masterpiece or what it is that makes one think it might be one.",Vertigo
457,preposterous,"one of the greatest works of art, alltime",10,23 May 2003,"There are many good films, and it may seem pretentious to think in terms of superlatives.  There are many good paintings, good plays, good books, but then there are some that tower just so high that they dwarf everything around them and defy analysis of any kind, either technical or aesthetic.I have just about every film which appears in the 'top 250' here at imdb, and Vertigo is my favorite, by a steep margin.  It's sublime, it hits on so many cylinders.  The color, the lighting, the symbolism, the drama, the personal dilemmas, the acting, the direction.There are some moments in art that are so rare, that they cannot even be measured by media, let alone eras.  In the genre of staged drama, 19th century and forward, I see maybe four titans: Wagner, Verdi, Puccini, and Hitchcock.  I can't think of any other movie director who soars as high, and it's not just Hitchcock who soars high in this movie.  It's also Bernard Hermann's music and Jimmy Stewart's acting.  It's the people who shot the film.  It's just a magical moment. What makes it happen?  Hitchcock, who is not only at the height of his powers, but is delving so deep into his subconscious that it defies analysis.  He creates an image in a movie with the same frenzied detail that Scotty seeks as he re-creates Madelaine.  The richness of Hitchcock's vision here is without rival in this history of film, as far as I am aware.As for other great Hitchcock films, there are Rear Window, Notorious, North by Northwest, Shadow of a Doubt, Strangers on a Train, and one of my personal favorites, Psycho.  But this one, Vertigo, this one goes all the way into Hitch's deepest thoughts.  It may very well be the greatest artistic creation of the 20th century.  It is certainly one of them.",Vertigo

Park Circus have just released the film in a stunning new 4K presentation and, quite honestly, though the film has always aged well, as testified by previous restorations, it has never looked better. I can see every minuscule detail on James Stewart's immaculate suits, and the exterior location shots look so fresh, it's almost as if they were filmed today, with 1950s Cadillac cars and signage thrown in for authenticity!James Stewart plays the gentleman police detective, John ""Scottie"" Ferguson, who, after a traumatic rooftop chase across San Francisco, realises he has acrophobia (a fear of heights) which brings on sensations of 'vertigo'. This ailment forces him to retire from the force and regain his health. However, an old college buddy comes out of the woodwork and asks Scottie to use his police know-how to privately investigate the strange habits of his wife, Madeleine Elster (Kim Novak). It transpires that she is haunted by Carlotta Valdes, an apparent figure in her family's past. Scottie gets roped into a web of love and deceit as he becomes transfixed by Madeleine and her obsessions.The most pleasing elements of the film are the beautiful soft-focus scenery, and the dramatic and swooning score by film music stalwart, Bernard Herrmann. The hypnotic opening titles and fantasy sequences with their avant-garde graphics would appear to be a precursor to Maurice Binder's famous title work for the James Bond films. The stunningly beautiful Novak and the ever-dependable Stewart are eminently convincing in their respective roles.

There were moments of suspense, fear, humor and romance.James Stewart, who has been in a large number of Hitch's flicks, does a great job here portraying a man tortured by his unsolvable fear of heights, leading to vertigo. The beautiful Kim Novak, playing Trudy and 'Madeleine', is excellent as well. She is very convincing, but I must say that her eyebrows are worthy of Maleficent. They were so arched it was distracting.The twist at the end is quite good as well, but one thing I did not like was the way she died.

464,Jon Kolenchak,A One of a Kind Masterpiece,10,28 November 2000,"There are several reasons why writing this review of Vertigo is difficult for me.  It has become my favorite film of all time. Bernard Herrmann (who wrote the film score) is one of my favorite composers, and to try to explain the film to someone unfamiliar with it without destroying the plot is absolutely impossible.I've seen several copies of the film over the years (in various stages of wear and tear), but if you have never seen this film before, be sure to get the completely restored DVD version.In a word, the film deals with obsession.  At the beginning of the film, Kim Novak plays a woman who is obsessed with the spirit of a dead woman.  Her husband, concerned for her safety hires James Stewart, a retired detective to trail her and keep an eye on her.  Stewart himself becomes obsessed with Novak.  It should also be mentioned that in the very first reel of the film, Stewart realizes that he has vertigo, and decides (also obsessively) to rid himself of that affliction.That's about all that one can say about this film without totally ruining it for someone who has never seen it.  It is the way that all the elements of filmmaking come together that make this a film like none other.  There are scenes in the film that, through the use of fog filters and extreme camera angles, one begins to feel as if the reality has vanished completely. There is a a scene in a graveyard, at the Golden Gate Bridge, and in a forest that have the texture of Impressionistic paintings ""come to life"".  Hitchcock so brilliantly weaves these reality and non-reality scenes together that the audience member soon has trouble identifying where one ends and the other begins.I believe that this is both James Stewart's and Kim Novak's finest acting achievement.  The range of emotions that each go through (especially Novak) will astound you.The score by Bernard Herrmann adds the perfect touch to this film, and I believe that without his contribution, the final result would have been much less effective.From the spinning Saul Bass credits at the beginning (which can be absolutely nauseating when seen on the big screen!) through the final scene, we see some very sincere characters end up coming full circle with their tragic destinies.Vertigo has so many layers to its structure that one must see the film several times to realize this.  It is a film that will never be the same once you have seen it the first time.  Even knowing that, it seems to grow and mature with each viewing.How I envy those who have not yet seen this film!",Vertigo

The characters do not act like real people; it's yet another film where this is the case. What makes it all the more infuriating is that there IS a clever story buried under all the sewage, clawing to get out. And it never does. Even at the end, there's a brief moment where things actually make sense - where there is some semblance of reality - only for it to be dashed by one of the most ludicrous finales I HAVE EVER SEEN. It's THAT BAD. That ending would be laughed out of the cinema today (and probably was back then), but because this film is considered a 'classic', it's applauded as some kind of masterpiece.

That was before watching it a second time.Unpopular with critics and audiences when was first released, it has since been reappraised. This is an occasion where I think they got it right the first time. There are two reasons, in my book, why some people (fewer than you think) sing this film's praises:1) The fantastic orchestral soundtrack (I won't deny that).2) All our current talk of 'the male gaze' (bring the sick bucket): a concept that this film so aptly embodies and critiques.If you do genuinely enjoy this film, I am very pleased for you! Paid film critics - and a select group of IMDb reviewers with a taste for the surreal - no doubt love it. But what about just a normal film-lover who does it for a hobby? Or somebody seeking entertainment after a hard day? I can guarantee that absolutely nobody sits down after a hard day to watch 'Vertigo'. It is slow and dull beyond belief. The mood sucks the life out of the room. The characters (especially Scottie Ferguson!) are just bleakly terrible people. They have no redemptive qualities or charisma. Kim Novak was probably the best of the crew; she could at least elicit some audience sympathy.Hitchcock was a masterful director. This is one of his most overrated films.

But, it's a remarkable film, simple yet highly effective story-telling, and perfectly cast. I do not think Jimmy Stewart was too old at all for his role, and Kim Novak was absolutely tremendous, as was the rest of the supporting cast. Fantastic Bernard Hermann score adds to the chilling love-obsession story, and the San Francisco setting is marvelous. One of the rare movies where it just gets better with each viewing, and I've seen it many, many times...it's one I watch at least twice-a-year. I cannot imagine anyone else in the roles Jimmy Steward and Kim Novak played --- they were believable 100% of the time.",Vertigo
471,Freddy_Levit,"SUSPENSE, SURPRISE and SUBSTANCE.......the work of the Master Of SUSPENSE - the unmatched classic, 'Vertigo'",10,24 April 2005,"Arguably the greatest Director in world cinema history, Alfred Hitchcock could very well have single handedly changed the face of the horror and thriller genres forever. His influence on cinema - his technique and style in particular - have inspirationally spawned countless copy cats, most famous of which have been the likes of John Carpenter, Tobe Hooper and Wes Craven. He instilled famous images in our heads - images that will scare future generations of showers, birds, ropes and airplanes. Many wouldn't even know he has done so. His films are instantly recognizable around the world. What is most fascinating, is that he could overwhelm you with suspense without much to it, for he didn't need blood, gore or very loud music to get the audience scared, because it was the timing, subtle camera movements, use of light and the extraordinary music that made audiences around the world tremble. Hitchcock's vision set standards much like David Lean set it for the epic scope and John Huston for adventure - much like Spielberg and Lucas would set it for the imagination. 'Vertigo' is the perfect example of his gift to the world. It is his masterful and complete compilation of the standards that people recognize him by.It is about a San Fransisco Private Eye named Scottie Ferguson (James Stewart) who following a police chase, where his partner falls to his death off a building, develops a fear of heights and is forced to retire. To his surprise, he is one day approached by an old friend from school who begs him to investigate the strange happenings of his wife Madelaine who he claims is possessed by some ghost. Initially hesitating, Scottie soon is personally drawn to Madelaine's situation, following her around San Fransisco. However, nothing prepares him for what lies ahead when lust, deception, conspiracy and murder unravel in a complex plot, in which he is determined to find the truth.I believe 'Vertigo' was Hitchock's definitive master work, because none captured his brilliant touch quite like it. Everything that you could throw into a suspenseful thriller was in it. Above all the story was the most engaging. The actors were flawless. The music and cinematography were splendid. None captured the essence of 'fear' as powerfully as it did. It is in my opinion a PERFECT film. From start to finish, you can't take your eyes off the screen. 'James Stewart' is perhaps the most mesmerizing and commanding presence ever to grace the silver screen. You could feel his anger, excitement, fear and sadness through his famous eyes and gestures. The scenery of San Fransisco was magnificent and truly added to the already overwhelming atmosphere Hitchcock is famous for. Music was never over indulgent and suited incredibly well with the happenings on-screen.What really impresses me is that few films have had as many plot twists and turns that 'Vertigo' showcases. You would learn something new every time you'd watch it. None have such an engaging plot as does this beautiful, atmospheric Mona Lisa of a film.Recommendations are useless. SEE THIS MOVIE NOW if you haven't done so. Forget about our contemporary film directors that excite you. No film in my opinion excites quite like Hitchcock's definitive masterpiece 'Vertigo'. It has everything you could hope for. This is a classic in every meaning of the word and should be a definite addition to everyone's video library.Hitchcock...........we miss you.....................forever!",Vertigo
472,jackhamel1987,The very best of Hitchcock.,10,30 August 2011,"Without a doubt, this is Hitchcock's best film. On top of that, I would personally put it in my own top 10 list, because this film is hugely complex and entertaining right from the opening shot to the very final moment. The thrills are first rate, the acting is first rate, the directing is outstanding and the musical score is one of the most haunting in film.Vertigo starts with a rooftop chase in San Fransisco. 'Scottie', a police detective, chases a suspect along with a uniformed police officer. Scottie slips, and nearly falls to his death. The other officer tries to help, and he does fall. From this moment, Scottie has Vertigo - a fear of heights.Cut to a few years later, and he is retired. However, a friend of his has a problem - his wife is behaving oddly and he needs Scottie to follow her. Scottie starts to follow her and watch her, and soon starts to fall in love with her, perhaps even become obsessed with her. After saving her life, it appears that she is falling for him too. But, it all comes to an end when she loses her mind and throws herself from a tower - a tower too high for Scottie to climb because of his Vertigo. Scottie has a breakdown, and is left feeling nothing but guilt. However, one day he sees something that chances his view on what happened.What makes this film stand out from nearly all others is the sheer complexity of the plot. The writing is absolutely first rate with good dialogue, but more importantly believable emotions, real situations and twist after twist to add to the vast story that is being told. Hitchcock genuinely takes each character and puts them through some sort of personal hell, and we really feel a lot of sympathy for each one. He carefully unveils traits through some tense actions scenes, and it always feels like there is more to know about each character. Vertigo isn't just about one man's fear, it's about the obsession that grows from that fear and how it affects those around him and those involved.Added to the exceptional directing is of course the cast. James Stewart puts on arguably his best performance as Scottie, the man so obsessed with a woman he can't see that he's turned into a hypocrite and a destroyer of women. To match him is Kim Novak, who puts her her best performance as Judy, the veiled woman to which there is so much more than it seems.This film, like many of Hitchcock's, is a slow burning thriller. But, unlike his others, this goes into much more depth in terms of emotion and character. He explores the deepest desires and the deepest nightmares of the human mind, and alongside some of the best direction in film and a very fine plot, Vertigo represents a work of film genius. The cherry on top is the haunting score by Benard Herrman, which is genuinely creepy.Absolutely one of the best, complex and diverse thrillers of all time.",Vertigo

At the time it was thought to be a fine opportunity for Ms. Novak to co star with legendary actor James Stewart and to be Directed by the great Hitchcock. I have always felt that Hitchcock new what he was doing by spooking Kim Novak by telling her that Vera Miles was his real choice for the film. Kim Novak was insecure all during the filming and its shows! Vera Miles a lovely leading lady never was in the league of the box office clout of Novak nor the outstanding beauty of Kim Novak in her high starring days of fame. I cannot think of any other actress who could have done this role as well as Novak possibly only Garbo.Vertigo was not well reviewed in 1958. In the rear view mirror of film history this masterful film was never nominated for Best Picture nor was James Stewart nor Kim Novak nor Alfred Hitchcock. All of them should have been nominated.

480,Hitch-26,Unbelievable,10,2 September 2000,"Hitchcock's Vertigo(1958) is generally regarded as one of Hitch's greatest movies ever and for good reason.  This movie has it all--great costumes and hairstyles by Edith Head, outstanding musical score by the incomparable Bernard Herrmann, incredible acting performances by James Stewart, Kim Novak, and Barbara Bel Geddes, and of course flawless directing by Hitchcock.  I really don't want to talk about the plot of the movie, but I will say it is a very complex but interesting one.  I read somewhere that Hitch wasn't really satisfied with Kim Novak's performance, but I can't see why.  Maybe it was the perception of her back then as a sex symbol ala Marilyn Monroe.  Her dual character role is one of the toughest to perform in all of the Hitch's movies.  The only one that can compare is the role of Marnie.  She is fantastic.

I own the DVD and will not give it up (as I intend on owning all his movies) but this is one of his very few films that bores me. James Stewart and Kim Novak both did a great job acting and Hitchcock did have some very interesting camera work going on (the zoom-in scene is amazing) but all and all, the film seemed to go nowhere and the ending couldn't have been worse. In my opinion, his best movies are The 39 Steps, The Birds, Rope, Rebecca, Shadow Of A Doubt and of course, North By Northwest.

482,jwardww,Rock Hudson Original Scottie,8,4 December 2011,"Yes, it truly would have been an original choice to cast Rock Hudson as Scottie Ferguson. He would have been right for the role in every way: looks, temperament, acting ability. He had already shown a successful romantic side in his Sirk soaps. And he had the brawn and all-American good looks to be believable as a retired San Francisco detective. At 32, he would have been more than believable as the love interest of Kim Novak, then 24. At any age he was a more sensitive actor with a greater range and sensibility than Stewart. Finally, among Hollywood producers, he would have been a plausible choice for the more than decent box office performance of his films. As it is, James Stewart, a non-actor, ruined the film because of his advanced age and for the dreary character he chose to create. He does not succeed in portraying a man poetically obsessed by a feminine ideal. When I first saw this movie I thought it was Kim Novak who stood in the way of Vertigo's becoming a masterpiece. But she actually does an acceptable job of embodying both the classy Madeleine and the baser Judy. Later I found out that even Hitchcock did not object to Novak's replacing Vera Miles, his original Madeleine; and when he had the chance to re-sign Miles after her pregnancy, he stayed with Novak. The only big mistake as far as Novak is concerned is the inclusion of the letter writing scene in which Judy Barton confesses her crime to Scottie and the audience. Hitchcock tried to have the scene deleted as he knew its absence would have made the movie more ambiguous and intriguing until the final half hour. It would have been more exciting to discover Judy's crime along with Scottie as he recognized the necklace from Carlotta's portrait. What's so wrong about Stewart? He was just under 50 in 1957, but he seems more like 70. He's doing his usual hapless bull in a China shop, where someone of greater finesse is called for. The naive persona which was charming in a movie like The Shop Around the Corner had been exaggerated by the time of It's a Wonderful Life and later films into a doddering caricature of Elmer Fudd. It's a bore and never appropriate for a romantic lead. The final scene would have played a thousand times better with Scottie seducing her to the top of the tower, instead of manhandling her as the screenplay called for. The sudden violence is out of character for Scottie, nor does it square with his romantic obsession to turn a woman—even as vulgar as Judy—into his ideal. The way the movie plays now, it's as if Stewart drags her to the belfry to throw her off. Had she gone willingly, then fallen out of her own guilt and fear, it would have seemed to be poetic justice instead of vendetta. Obviously the screenplay was partly to blame. But a lot of that incorrect emotion created by the ending has to do with Stewart's poor acting.",Vertigo

485,tommythek,The best ever? The best Hitch ever?,8,6 November 2001,"A lot of people seem to think so. I see people, here, calling this the best movie ever; or, if not that, at the very least, the best movie Hitchcock ever made. To call ""Vertigo"" the best movie ever is, of course, quite laughable. And as far as it being Hitchcock's best, I judge it to be only about his 4th or 5th best (my personal favorite is ""North by Northwest,"" truly one of the best movies ever). Based on these comments, one might assume that I don't much like it. Right? Au contraire! I think it is a very good movie, one not far removed from excellent. But it does have flaws, minor though they be.First and foremost, ""Vertigo"" is a FABULOUS travelogue for late-1950s San Francisco and environs (including Muir Woods in Marin County and Mission San Juan Bautista, 100 miles south of San Francisco). At the time of the filming, I was a high school sophomore in San Francisco. I well remember the film company coming to town to shoot the movie, though I never saw any scenes actually being shot. What I do know is that the movie is most evocative of the San Francisco of that era.The plot? It's good, I've seen better. Its weakest link is when Scottie (James Stewart) ""loses"" Madeleine (Kim Novak), or so he thinks, then accidentally ""finds"" Judy (Madeleine's alter ego -- also Kim) on the streets of downtown San Francisco. I realize that movies often have to have coincidences in order to make their plots work. That said, ""Vertigo"" has to take a grading markdown for this ridiculously coincidental Madeleine-cum-Judy plot device in order to make this story work. Having lived so many years in San Francisco, I know how difficult it would be -- make that impossible! -- to find one specific person on a downtown street, ESPECIALLY when you're not even looking for that person in the first place. That's how difficult and coincidental it would have been for Scottie to actually ""find"" Judy. I also didn't care for the way the character Midge (Barbara Bel Geddes) was handled. Was she or was she not Scottie's ""love interest"" before Madeleine entered the picture? She starts out as a major character, then gradually fades away and by the end of the picture, she has disappeared completely, as if she were never even in the movie. True, Scottie becomes more and more obsessed with Madeleine/Judy, but let's at least let Midge hang in to the bitter end as the crushed girlfriend -- or something!    Jimmy Stewart and Kim Novak. The former is my favorite actor -- EVER!!! -- so you know I have nothing bad to say about his performance in this movie. It was just your typically fine performance by ""The Man."" As for Kim Novak, I see many people, once again here, commending her great performance in this film. Sheesh! Gag me with a spoon, Charlie Brown! Her performance in this movie is barely adequate, at best. Barely. It's no wonder Sir Alfred of the Hitch actually wanted Vera Miles for the role and when he couldn't get her (she was pregnant at the time), had to ""settle for"" Kim. Talk about a one-note samba performance! Kim is a classic example of a gorgeous woman with no true acting talent who came to Hollywood and was able to break into movies strictly on the basis of her beauty. Unlike some actresses in her category (Julia Roberts is one who comes to mind), Kim never developed one iota as an actress and that is why she had such a nothing career in the movies. Her one talent was to stand there and look pretty -- hopefully with her mouth shut! And she is the major dead weight that prevented ""Vertigo"" from being all that Hitch hoped and wanted it to be.Last, I cannot ignore Bernard Herrmann's score for this movie. When it comes to scoring a movie, this is as good as it gets. I don't know all of his scores without looking them up but I seriously doubt that he ever did a better score -- for any movie! -- than the one he did for ""Vertigo.""The best ever? The best Hitch ever? For those people who think this movie is -- one or the other -- I commend those people for knowing what they like. I, of course, cannot agree -- to either one. But ..... if only Vera Miles had been available.",Vertigo
486,stealth4933,Incredibly Creepy Romance,10,3 July 2008,"In my opinion Vertigo is the greatest movie ever and Hitchcock's masterpiece. This is just my opinion, so don't fault me for it. Vertigo is to thrillers what Casablanca is to Romances, what Raging Bull is to sports movies, and what Singing in the Rain is to musicals. Vertigo breaks rules and crosses lines that are not meant to be crossed. The fact that the main character even has Vertigo is a stroke of genius. But the real genius happens at the end, when James Stewart's romantic ordeal is over and he loses his Vertigo. It makes the movie seem like a circle, where in the end Stewart is the same as he was in the beginning. This really caught my attention and made me fall in love with this movie. Vertigo is also one of those movies that cannot be copied. Psycho was copied hundreds of times, as was Rear Window and the Birds, all Hitchcock masterpieces. I know that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, but each great director should have one movie that is unimitatable and incredibly unique. Hitchcock pulled this requirement off with Vertigo.",Vertigo
487,SciFiSheriff,"A chilling, Thrilling, entertaining classic!",10,5 January 2012,"British Director Alfred Hitchcock has made some good movies in his time. 2 Of his films really stand out to me; North By NorthWest and...Vertio!! The plot goes like this;A detective who is haunted by his dramatic past involving heights is asked to shadow a old friend's wife who has gone insane. She makes regular pleasure jaunts on her own and appears to be trying to commit suicide. The more detective John Ferguson delves into the situation however, the more he falls desperately in love with the woman...James Stwert has done a lot of movies for Hitchcock; The man who knew too much remake, Rope, rear window-all classics. However, James Stewart really tops it all in this thrilling extravaganza.Lets start off with the acting. As you wold expect from a film of this class, the acting is nothing under A*. James Stewart plays his role perfectly, adding great lines and sometimes anger into his role. The supporting cast is fantastic too. The reason I don't delve to deep into what the actors say is because this film is surprisingly action based (No, not shooting). What I mean is sometimes, the film has no talking what-so-ever. Instead you see the characters expressions and movements to a great extent and you can almost read the character's minds. This is a technique lost in modern filmmaking.Spoilers coming up.The story is sometimes really hard to follow, especially halfway through the film. You eventually find out that the woman committing suicide is actually a conspiracy made by her husband to murder. James Stewart gets caught in the scene and when he finally finds it all out, it's too late. but then another woman who looks identical to the woman who was murdered appears in town and Stewert can't resist looking into it. I will not spoil any more for you, but I can guarantee, the ending will make you think good, long and hard about it. Not that that's a bad thing of coarse.Fantastic storyline that lacks in a lot of thrillers.Another thing I liked about the acting was the creepy wife. Throughout the movie, she looks completely blank; no expressions, no emotions, Nothing!! She rarely speaks in the whole film apart from about once a scene. In my opinion she is one of the most well crafted characters in thriller history.Lots of scenes in this movie are very intense. They will have you at the end of your scene and most of this is due to what I call musical timing. This is where films use the right types of music for the right scenes and they have to be at an exact moment, or the scene will fall flat on it's face. in this film, it is used to an extreme. Sometimes it will be really quite and then music will bare out when something intense happens. The musical score is pure brilliance.All in all, a fantastic thriller and probably Hitchcock's greatest hit, tied with Noth By Northwest which you should really check out if you love this film.To think this film was poorly received when it first came out! in fact, it was James' last movie working with Hitchcok because Hitchcock thought he was to blame for the failure. humph. I right! Anyway Brilliant film and one of the best heart stopping thrillers of all time.",Vertigo
488,Goodbye_Ruby_Tuesday,Hitchcock's once-overlooked masterpiece,10,21 December 2006,"John ""Scottie"" Ferguson (Jimmy Stewart, never better) is a retired detective with a severe fear of heights after a botched chase to capture a criminal. Due to his newly acquired acrophobia, he retires and wanders around the beautiful streets of San Francisco. Out of the blue, an old college friend Gavin Elster asks him to follow his wife Madeleine, as he believes that Madeleine may be possessed by the spirit of her great-grandmother, drifting in and out of reality and into trance-like states of mind. So Scottie agrees to follow the mysterious blonde (Kim Novak) as Hitchock guides us throughout San Francisco and into his strange and dark mind. Little by little, Scottie begins to become infatuated with Madeleine, and after he saves her from suicide (she jumped into San Francisco Bay) and decides to help her, he falls madly in love with her. In finding pieces of the puzzle to Madeleine's mystery, their journey takes them to the San Juan Bautista where Madeleine meets her end by tumbling off the bell tower, presumably by suicide. Scottie tried to save his love but his fear of heights stopped him. For the next year Scottie falls into a deep depression, feeling guilty for his impotency to save his love. His depression is halted when he sees Judy Barton (Novak again). Judy isn't like Madeleine--she's plain, in touch with reality and even vulgar when compared. But her face looks so much like Madeleine. Scottie begins to court Judy first for herself but eventually he tries to mold her into the beauty he lost prematurely, unaware that Judy has a big secret up her sleeve.When it was first released, Vertigo didn't get good reviews and it didn't make money at the box office. People didn't understand the bizarre dream sequences that were so ahead of their time, they didn't feel sympathy for the characters (at the end, even Scottie is unlikable), and the BIG TWIST is given away in the middle of the movie instead of at the end, a la Psycho. Even I had my complaints about that last one, yet after a second viewing I realized that this movie wasn't even about what really happened to what really happened to Madeleine; it's about men's psychological--and sexual--desire for the perfect woman, even if she's out of touch with reality. This movie is considered Hitchcock's most personal film, as he could be domineering with his actresses, trying to mold them into his own dream. After the ""failure"" of Vertigo, Hitchcock never worked with Jimmy Stewart again, unfairly blaming him for not being able to draw a crowd on account of his age. Luckily for everyone, Vertigo has gotten better with age and is no longer forgotten. In the late 80s Vertigo started popping up on Top 10 Films of All Time lists, and today it's considered Hitchock's best film, and most definitely one of the best ever made.The biggest reason for Vertigo's late success is because it is Hitchcock's most analyzed film and because it works on a psychological level; The film points out that men would rather have an unavailable, beautiful woman who is out of touch with reality than a woman who understands her surroundings and is utterly available. This is pointed out twice, once with Midge, an ex-fiancée and good friend of Scottie and later with Judy, who tries to make Scottie love her for who she is and not because she reminds Scottie of Madeleine. The first hour is drawn out very slowly, and while it's not as fast-paced as other Hitchcock's films, he uses it wisely. He starts by first gaining--later testing--our sympathy for Scottie; when he's hanging for his dear life in the opening scene, we pray for him (even though we know that there would be no movie if Jimmy Stewart dies in the first 3 minutes). When he's chasing Madeleine up the bell tower, we hope that he can get there in time and kiss his lover. And when the romance turns dark in the second outing to the bell tower, you feel just as caught in the middle as Scottie does in that moment. Hitchcock blurred the lines between victim and villain, and he earns our creative respect for him.The key element to why Vertigo works so well in the end is because of the actors. It's practically impossible to think of anyone other than James Stewart, who embodied the everyman, and for that reason is so convincing in testing our sympathies. It's all in the minimalistic ways he does it, with the slightest crinkle in the forehead or the movement in the eyes doing evoking more emotion than most actors do screaming and crying. This is his best performance next to Mr. Smith Goes to Washington. And Kim Novak is ravishing and haunting both as Madeleine and Judy, utterly convincing in both roles. With my respects to Grace Kelly, Novak just may be the most mysterious and convincing Hitchcock blonde to grace the screen. Their chemistry together, despite their age difference is explosive and natural.Buy--don't rent--this DVD and you'll find yourself falling for every detail of this brilliant film.",Vertigo

I'd seen `North by Northwest', `Rear Window', `Psycho', and `Rebecca', each several times, before seeing `Vertigo'. Now having seen `Vertigo' several times, the jury of my mind is out. It's the best. The entire cast is at its best. Let people flap their lips about `It's a Wonderful Life', `Vertigo' contains James Stewart's greatest performance. His obsession even takes physical form, his eyes gleam with it, and his brow glistens with sweat in anger and in fear. His performance climbing the steps of the tower at the end of the film is magic. Kim Novak has hardly the resume of Stewart, but her performance even surpasses his at times. The way her face tightens in her sadness, she is even divine in the scenes where she is purposely distant from the scene. A seldom used Barbara Bel Geddes is also good.These two stars alone mean a great movie. But the plot, and the man who molded it, are the stars here. The quirky plot gives me chills from its air of creativity and ultimate excellence of being. This tale of obsession forces me to watch the film over and over, indulging in the plot twists every time.Incredible, innovative camera-work from the `master' make this one of the great technical achievements of movie history.What else to say? 10/10 stars.",Vertigo
491,dmwhite50,Mesmerizing Masterpiece,10,5 April 2001,"VERTIGO is absolutely one of the very best films I've ever seen--a mesmerizing masterpiece about obsession that has the power to haunt its viewers for years to come. After seeing it, years later whole sequences will revive in the memory. Hitchcock also brilliantly explores the very nature of reality, and seems to ask the question, ""Do we ever truly know anyone?"" Kim Novak and James Stewart are both brilliant in the film.VERTIGO is also one of the most aesthetically beautiful movies ever made.",Vertigo
492,sapblatt,Perhaps Hitchcock's best effort,9,4 January 2004,"Most critics, myself included tend to overuse the words `masterpiece' and `genius.' No adequate critique of 1958s `Vertigo' can be written without referencing the fact that the film is truly a masterpiece work from the genius director, Alfred Hitchcock.The storyline is complex in `Vertigo.' Jimmy Stewart, always one of Hitchcock's favorite actors puts on his best performance in a Hitchcock film as Scottie, a retired San Francisco detective who has vertigo brought on by a trauma that occurred on a rooftop. Scottie is reluctantly taken out of retirement when an old acquaintance played by Tom Helmore (`Secret Agent ' `The Time Machine') asks him to investigate the strange behaviors and habits of his wife, played by Kim Novak (`The Man With the Golden Arm' `Kiss Me, Stupid'.)Scottie tails the wife and is sucked into the story and of course he ends up finding the beautiful Novak irresistible. Not wanting to spoil the story for anyone who has not seen this classic I will just mention that once Stewart meets Novak the complexities and twists and turns multiply significantly.
The filming is done beautifully, particularly the location shooting near the Golden Gate Bridge and the two scenes that take place at the mission south of the city. A scene where Stewart is following Novak and she parks her car in a back alley while our detective stares at her is wonderfully honored in Martin Scorsese's `Goodfellas' in a scene where Robert DeNiro tries to lure Karen Hill (Lorraine Bracco) into an alley way so she can help herself to some stolen dresses  or get herself killed.Perhaps the most famous shot is the classic stairway shot filmed at the mission. Stewart has to fight his fear of heights and chase Novak up a long stairway. I am not a cinematographer, but I believe Hitchcock accomplished this by filming a Stewart going along the stairs while the camera simultaneously zoomed in on Stewart while the same camera was wheeled back and away from the subject. This creates a dizzying sense to the viewer that is meant to mimic Scotties's vertigo. Absolutely brilliant.
Also fantastically brilliant in this film and the special effects and the score. A while back, a friend's husband turned me onto the world of artist Saul Bass. Bass contributed so much to the movies and is yet not known too many. Bass was an artist who designed sets, titles and visual effects like the dream sequence in `Vertigo.' If you have seen many movies from the 1950s you know that the nightmare sequence in `Vertigo' is one of the few visual effects from any movie if this era that still works for the viewer in the new millennium. Bass was perhaps best known for his work with Otto Preminger, and he also did the titles for many Scorsese movies. Bernard Herrmann (`Psycho ' `Cape Fear (both versions' `Taxi Driver') composed the chilling and compelling music for `Vertigo,' in what I think is his best work. The music from this movie is available on a soundtrack CD.Other reviewers and critics have mentioned in the past that `Vertigo' is perhaps Hitchcock's most personal film. One could only guess that Hitchcock found this story to be a somewhat cathartic experience. Stewarts somewhat kinky, perverted scenes with Novak in where he tries to convert her into the perfect woman that was the object of his desires are at the same time interesting and unsettling to the viewer. `Vertigo' also displays some great acting, particularly by James Stewart who is pretty much in front of the camera during the entire film. Through the necessities of the script Stewart had to carry the brunt of this film, and he does not disappoint. Allegedly, Kim Novak was chosen by Hitchcock for her looks (surprise, surprise) and her performance was completely controlled by Hitchcock (yet another surprise!) Barbara Bal Geddes ably portrays Stewarts long-term artist girlfriend in waiting. It is never adequately explained why she waits and why she does not seem to mind. All in all, a great piece of work from the master of suspense.",Vertigo
493,devon2468,Vertigo,9,14 November 2020,"I believe this film has one of the most gipping want-to-be romances that I have seen in a movie to date, and the thriller aspect of the movie revolving around a mystery death is what really sells it for me.",Vertigo
494,adam_pittavino,So good it's scary.,10,7 August 2013,"'Vertigo', Alfred Hitchcock's nostalgic mystery classic is one of those rare films in that the less you know about it, the better. Vertigo is a tale of love and intrigue that fatally spirals into obsession and deception as James Stewart struggles desperately to unravel a strangers bizarre and secret life. Set in San Francisco, retired detective Scottie Ferguson (Stewart) is approached by an old acquaintance to spy on his wayward wife(Kim Novak)but when a severe case of vertigo creeps in, he quickly realizes that the task at hand is much more dangerous. Stewart, suffering from not only acrophobia, but by his own torment, is helplessly driven by Novak's beauty and is drawn into a dream like world haunted with the possibilities of his own failures. Alfred Hitchcock, master of suspense, has created a romantic epic, an alluring and seductive masterpiece that plays out beautifully against the San Francisco skyline. Hitchcock's heavyweight's 'Psycho' and 'The Birds' may stake claim as his trademark classics, but 'Vertigo' surely ranks as one of the greatest movies ever made.",Vertigo
495,PadraigWalshFilm,Premise - Pure Gold. Director - Pure Gold. Almost perfect.,8,1 August 2012,"Alfred Hitchcock's Vertigo is the story of John ""Scottie"" Ferguson, a San Francisco police detective who plans to retire due to his acrophobia and the death of another police officer because of it. After he retires he is called upon by an old friend to follow his wife and check out the strange activities she's been doing. While following her, Scottie becomes obsessed with her and slowly falls in love with her.I quite enjoyed this film. It is much like a typical Hitchcock film, it's got the same feel, but it seems a bit different. The premise is pure gold and Hitchcock does an amazing job with it. The music was perfectly suited to the film in general, and also each scene it was neatly placed in. It has a few twists, as a Hitchcock film should, and I was completely stunned by how much I liked it. I'll admit, it got a tiny bit boring, but the second I started getting bored of it, something happened and made me interested almost immediately. It's like he intended to do that. It looks great, for a film of the 50's. I liked the ending, but I didn't like it. Without spoiling anything, it ended sort of, abruptly. It was good, but I think they should have added a tiny bit more, I was so intrigued by where the story was going and especially the character of Scottie, I just wanted to know his reaction to it. Less subtlety. But all in all, a great watch. A nice typical Hitchcock film that was just brilliant.",Vertigo
496,Dire_Straits,_almost_ a waste of 2 hours 9 minutes...,6,24 May 2005,"I watched Vertigo for only the 2nd time yesterday (the first time being some 15 years ago). I had forgotten most of the plot, so I was hoping to be surprised.I was surprised. This movie, although it's VERY NICE to look at with it's vibrant colors and lovely San Francisco scenery, is simply a boring film.There's a lot of unnecessary footage in the film; this movie could have been cut by 20-25 minutes and it would have been a better film.I LOVE most of Hitchcock's stuff; this really doesn't seem to resemble anything I know of Hitchcock, save Jimmy Stewart (who acts like Jimmy Stewart on Grateful Dead Mushrooms). Stewart acts rather strangely...I don't like his character at all. If he was any kind of actor at all - he would have been scary (perhaps). Instead, he comes off looking deranged...and not because he has vertigo. Novak comes off as stupid - watch the movie and you'll see what I am talking about.I'm not really sure at what Hitchcock was trying to do in this picture...the animation and dream scenes DO NOT HOLD UP AT ALL. As a matter of fact, they seem juvenile.A rather convoluted story doesn't help, but this picture wasn't bad - just very tedious and a lot of pointless, wasted time during the first hour of the film. Plus Hitchcock uses a lot of McGuffin's and he stretches them -at times- beyond what he should. Maybe it was all a joke. I'm not alone in this - many professional reviewers have said the same thing.The best job of acting in the film is done by Barbara Bel Geddes and sadly, that's not saying much (although she is very pretty in 1958 - she's more alluring to me than Kim Novak).",Vertigo
497,rsgre,This movie just doesn't work for me anymore,5,16 April 2005,"Sorry to intrude on this ""love fest"", if it is one, but...(I don't know if it is just the passing years or what), but this film just doesn't work for me anymore. Hitchcock is at his most extreme: stilted and improbable story line, red herrings, unresolved scene endings, deliberately severed suspense, demeaning and downbeat character portrayals, and a totally cynical and uncompromising ending. Hitchcock of the ""least Hollywood kind"", as one critic put it.Being from California, I do enjoy the wonderful ""time capsule"" quality of the film; a lot has changed since 1957. The story is beautifully photographed (by Robert Burks) and wonderfully scored (by Bernard Herrmann, possibly his best), but the story is downright unbelievable, and deliberately so, I think, by a cynical artist who demonstrated (in an era of epics) that he could make a total incomprehensible film, and get away with it. The plot makes little sense and Hitchcock even ""pushes the envelope further"" by making the plot so unbelievable, that only a child would accept it. In 1983, the critics Seiskel & Ebert described ""The Trouble with Harry"" as ...""Hitchcock's private joke...unfortunately, it's a little too private..."", and I think the same can be said about ""Vertigo"": an uncompromising film that refuses to give little, if any instant gratification and insults our intelligence as well.I sometimes wonder if the whole movie is some huge practical joke on Hitchcock's part. In an era of epics, he decided to make the anti-epic. A personal private movie to prove that he had the ""wealth and the power"", as an artist, to do anything he wanted to. A movie in which he would show total disdain for credibility or audience expectations, and sit back and watch (and laugh!) as all these pseudo-intellectuals, want-to-be movie critics, and various film buffs (maybe like us) tried to find ""meaning"". (Surprise!... There isn't any!) Hitchcock liked to portray men as weak, ineffectual, mother and/or wife dominated, or just plain thieves and killers. He outdid himself on this one with the two male leads:1. John ""Scotty"" Ferguson-a dumb, inept, unmotivated, asexual, self-retired, middle-aged ex-detective. 2. Gavin Elster-A slimy, sleazy, smooth talking opportunist(and murderer as well!), masquerading as an industrialist.And then for a the women:1. He has Marjorie ""Wood"" (how appropriate): a ""clueless"" nerdy, geeky, tomboy of a girl! (Hitchcock's cynicism is showing here...!) 2. Judy Bartlett (alias Madeleine Elster), a ""dumb blonde"" if there ever was one. A docile, stupid robot with one man, and a ""silly little girl"" with the other one....totally unbelievable!!Anyway...that's the way I see it at age 56, so maybe my cynicism is showing as well (and it's about the same age that Hitchcock was when he made this film). Must be nice to have the ""wealth & power"" to make a deliberate ""bomb"", and still get paid for it! Artists are strange people, and Hitchcock sure was one of them!Steve G.Sept. 6, 2005 Update: Alright, alright, maybe I was a little rough on Hitch; after all, it's only a movie! I am beginning to think that Hitch was living his fantasy while making this film. He was Scotty, and that's why the film is like a dream, with a lot of unexplained events. I'll settle for the nice scenery and music, but the plot...(well, let's just say: it could have been better!).July 17, 2006 Update (posted in the message board as well)Hi Everybody, well...after all these years I finally saw the alternate (foreign censorship) ending, on the collector's edition DVD. A little hard to find: you have to go to Bonus Materials, then ""Obsessed with Vertigo"", then chapter list and scroll to chapter 14, and there it is! It only lasts a minute and 20 seconds, oh but what a difference it makes! Finally...some closure!! Takes place in Midge's apartment at night, and starts with a closeup of Midge to the left and a radio to the right. We hear the announcer saying that Gavin Elster was living in Switzerland but is now thought to be in France, and that Captain Hansen anticipates no trouble in having him extradited soon. Closeup of Midge as she hears footsteps and her front door opening. Scotty enters wearing a suit, but no hat, looks at Midge and then walks to the center of the room, and toward the window. Midge stands, and we now see she is only wearing a robe, and pours a drink for herself and Scotty. She walks over to him and hands him the drink then makes a half circle to her drawing desk, sits down, they both look at each other...fadeout! What happens after this is up to the viewer's imagination, but it was a great relief to me! I always thought that the original ending was kind of a cruel joke on the audience. Hitch was a weird guy! The foreign censors were correct in insisting on it (like spanking a naughty boy!). Where were our own censors, I'd like to know? How come the rest of the world got the complete story and the US didn't? Did Hitch forget we saved Britain from a German invasion? Weird guy...but thank God for closure!!! By the way, my new viewing does reveal a very well acted and very well crafted film, but still a rather prissy, childish, and silly story. That's my ""take"" anyway...! Regards, RSGRE",Vertigo
498,DeadeGuard98,"A Phobia, A Plot and The Haunting",10,30 May 2020,"😱 First Impressions:
The first ever work I saw of Alfred Hitchcock was Psycho- revolutionary as a slasher but I grew hungrier for more his thriller masterpieces. Then I saw Dial M for Murder and finally Vertigo. Though I had my doubts initially, this has arguably become one of my absolute favorites by the legend.
Pros:
😋 The ensemble cast. It goes without saying of course that the director knows how to pick them! But I must absolutely commend the range of protagonists Scottie and Madeliene/Judy who essentially play two different characters each or rather the impression that they are.😋 The first time watching it (even sometimes when rewatching it), I could not foresee the shocker of an ending. The over-the-top albeit ingenious of a murder scheme is absolutely entertaining and I can only blame myself for falling in love with the characters... getting too attached.😋 The cinematography is beautiful; throughout it's runtime there comes the occasionally rare moment portraying a ephemeral quality; much akin to that of a ghost's or the otherwordliness (in keeping with the theme after all). It stays with you. Even the act of describing and then later on showing the dream sequences are terrifying.Cons:
😪 There was that one part in the film where I thought the reveal was rather quick and sudden- we had just gotten to know Kim Novak's second character, Judy. I mean obviously they are played by the one and only actress but there could have been a much longer psychological game to play juggling between the two women. Is it just a striking resemblance? Doesn't it say more about the character of Scottie, seemingly unable to move on after changing Judy's appearance only to find out it was all worthless.😪 Midge's character never saw an ending or resolution. At least with Madeleine's husband, it's explained that he has left after having perfectly executed the deed with his late wife. I thought she was phenomenal! Pining after Scottie, she was the only one there to help him after his mental breakdown. It's not really a vexing issue but one I just felt sorry for- perhaps that was the goal.😇Verdict😈
One of the most iconic thrillers that played with audience's expectation start to finish. Usually I am quite good at guessing how the endings would go to slashers, thrillers or even horror movies in general. But when it comes to Alfred Hitchcock's portfolio, I always seem to miss the mark. The endings always endure in the back of your mind long after the viewing and that's something we have yet to see in a modern thriller.",Vertigo
499,Andrew-162,Haunting,10,1 February 2000,"There is so much to this movie that an amateur watcher like myself can not come close to doing it justice, but I'll try. This movie is one of the 10 best of all time, and without a doubt Hitchcock's best. Here are the top things about it. 1. The Themes: The theme of Madeliene (The gorgeous Kim Novak in an absolutely haunting performance)getting her mind inhabited from a lost woman of a past, the theme of Scottie (Jimmie Stewart in an equally impressive performance) falling hopelessly in love with this shadow of a woman he knows so little about and becomes obsessed with rescuing her, and finally, the theme of Judy, who to Scottie is a portrait of Madeleine, a voice calling to him from beyond the grave, but possibly most importantly, the theme of Scottie's vertigo, which prevents him from ""Saving"" his love that final run up the church tower 2. The Beauty: The movie was nominated for a Best Art Direction Oscar. I have no idea what it lost to, but I'm sure Vertigo was more worthy of it. Hitchcock's ""San Francisco"" is as haunting as the rest of the movie, from it's ironically beautiful graveyards to the shape of the church from which Madeleine takes the deadly plunge. It is one of the most beautiful movies I have ever seen 3. THE SCORE: This is the most important of all of them. The one reason that movies like Psycho and North By Northwest are better in my opinion than movies like Rear Window and Rebecca is the fact that Psycho and North By Northwest had shrieking Bernard Hermann scores, the most memorable of all movie scores (Taxi Driver was also a highlight for him). But VERTIGO is the best of all of them. Vertigo's score almost makes us feel like we are Scottie, so confused, so sad, and yet so scared. It is the most memorable of all movie scores, even more the so then the more famous Psycho score.See this movie---it is one of the most wonderful experiences you can enjoy.",Vertigo
500,Tippy_Cup,"The first hour drags, just a little. But then it picks up and keeps gaining speed.",9,24 July 2008,"Vertigo, I feel takes a bit too long to get where it's going in the first half. (Although I may feel differently when I watch it again). But to me a lot of it, (the first half) felt kind of like 'character set up' material from a TV series, that would be put in between other scenes of other characters doing other stuff, so interest would be maintained. Whilst I didn't get bored exactly, I went from completely intrigued in the first 30 minutes to less and less until the death from the church tower.The cinematography is brilliant, but does anyone need to point that out, it is Hitchcock after all. But I loved the way he shot San Francisco, he really truly knows how to romanticize cities by shooting them beautifully. Sure the fact that now this is more then 50 years on, so it's 'San Fran 50 years ago' adds to the romanticism, but it's still wouldn't soar to the levels it does without the cinematography.I'm not sure if James Stewart was supposed to be a bit of a jerk, but when he pulls Novak up the stairs in the end and the argue, then they kiss. It sure wasn't a 'Happily Ever After' kiss, which would've made the ending ALL the more effective.The end, even the way it was is just brilliant though, unexpected and dark. People went on and on about 'The Mists' ending, which I feel just make the characters in it idiots, but this was shocking.Great, deserving of it's accliam and will be an eternal classic.9/10(Reviewed after first Viewing)",Vertigo
501,jasonsurety,Beautifully restored,10,20 August 2003,"The colors in Vertigo almost seem brighter than life.  Living in San Francisco and watching this movie I couldn't help but wish I had lived here in 1958.  The quality of picture is not the only thing noticeable.  Jimmy Stewart and Kim Novak are outstanding.  The premise is made believable by the two stars and the way Hitch continually shows Stewart observing Novak from afar:  growing more and more intrigued. The premise?  An ex-detective(Stewart) is called on by an old friend to follow his wife.  The man is afraid his wife is literally possessed. Stewart doesn't believe this at first, but the more he watches Novak the more uncertain he becomes.",Vertigo
502,cfcpg,The director of this is Ed Wood!,1,13 January 2006,"Vertigo is considered a masterpiece yet I found it one of the most boring movies ever. The reason is very simple. There is one thing missing: ""cinema"".Those opening credits are terribly annoying with something continuously spinning. The movie is slow, so slow that I have the impression of watching a school play. The direction is amateurish, with no style at all. Flat. Technically poor. That camera doesn't move. Rouben Mamoulian way back in 1932 (Dr. Jekyll) was 10 times more fancy whilst movie making was just at dawn.The actors are either plastered or made of wood. Kim Novak has a terrible make-up. The events and the story are absolutely improbable.The movie is old, obsolete, tedious but on the other hand it is so nice & clean and self-satisfied! The result? It is even more unbearable.Forget about those panoramic scenes. It is my impression that for at least a couple of them they were filmed indoor with the actors standing in front of a screen.Other terrible things: I didn't know if I had to laugh or cry when James Stewart was about to faint after standing on a chair (Vertigo!) The scene of Stewart jumping in the bay to fetch someone that fell in it is so poorly filmed that even a kid could have come up with something better.No, I do not like Hitchcock. I prefer directors like Ed Wood. They are more sincere.",Vertigo
503,dstanwyck,"I know I'm committing sacrilege, but...",7,30 September 2015,"For some reason, over the years, I've seen only bits and pieces of this movie and never in its entirety. Finally, tonight, I did. And this is all I have to say: Shadow of a Doubt, Strangers on a Train, Notorious, North by Northwest, The 39 Steps, The Lady Vanishes, Rebecca, Young and Innocent, Psycho, Saboteur, Sabotage, and a few others warrant more acclaim than this over-long, over-rated, over-done and over-wrought production. It can be rated a seven-starrer and on a night when I'm feeling giddy with generosity, 8. But all in all a sour disappointment. How it managed to grow in acclaim, I am at a loss. The acting was superlative, with Stewart growing from a barely bearable personality (dull and duller) to a thoroughly dislikable fellow who'd been done wrong. Kim Novak was a delightful surprise. I've always liked her and found her to be very sympathetic whenever I've seen her - Middle of the Night, Picnic, - and a much better actress than was generally granted. In this she excelled. Barbara Bel Geddes should have been elevated to greater stardom and Tom Helmore was perfect as the heel. The photography was good, colorful, with interesting collage-like minutes of sailing/falling through air. The music was non-stop (unusual in movies) - there was never a moment when some notes were not being heard and they heightened the intensity. But...But: 2 hours and 8 minutes! No movie should be 2 hours and 8 minutes. It's like reading a fat book that can't help but repeat itself. I did like it though and would REALLY have liked it had it shaved off at least 20 minutes in the middle. But Shadow of a Doubt? Now, THAT'S movie magic. And that's my 2 cents!",Vertigo
504,john-hogan23,"""You shouldn't keep souvenirs of a killing. You shouldn't have been that sentimental.""",10,4 November 2014,"Vertigo is an absolutely fascinating look into the deep psychological effect trauma can have on the mental health of an otherwise completely sane individual. James Stewart stars as John Ferguson, a San Francisco detective forced to retire after witnessing the tragic death of his partner. The incident causes him to develop a debilitating fear of heights and the toll it takes on his mental health becomes the focus of the beginning of the film. He is forced to bring an end to his brief retirement when a friend from college contacts him to solve the mystery of his wife's peculiar behavior, and Ferguson's fragile mental state is exacerbated by the unbelievable nature of the situation. One of, if not the best aspect of this film is James Stewart's outstanding performance. I was hugely impressed by his unique and exceptional presence. Everything about Stewart is leading man material. His voice and appearance and the way he presents his character are all so amusingly Scottish and he makes John Ferguson such a compelling character. The entire film relies on his ability to feel genuine. he needs to be convincing and real for Hitchcock's story to succeed, and he does not disappoint. He becomes progressively less stable as the story unfolds, and he gives this an undeniably authentic feel. I was deeply affected by what he had become by the end of the film, I actually worried for Ferguson as a character, and that made him unforgettable.The most important part of making a great mystery is a story that can remain intriguing throughout. It needs to be puzzling enough for the film's success to ride entirely on the conclusion, and it needs to deliver in a way that leaves the viewer effected by the mystery itself. With a good mystery, you're left pondering the implications of everything that had transpired. One of the things I really loved about the film was how uncompromising it was in it's originality. Vertigo felt like Vertigo, it felt like its own entity free from comparison. There aren't many other stories so captivating. Vertigo refused to underwhelm.Vertigo is surrounded by a daunting amount of hype, to the point where you can't really expect it to live up to everything it's made out to be. Instead of simply surpassing my expectations, which it did, it also proved itself to have a real, admirable complexity to it. Vertigo creates a riveting world for John Ferguson, and that's something only the best films can do.",Vertigo
505,Sethtro,I'm running in circles trying to like this film.,7,7 September 2020,"Personal Rating: 7/10To cut to the chase, this movie didn't live up to my expectations. Coming off the back of 'Dial M for Murder' which I adored, I was excited to watch what critics argue to be the best film of Hitchcock's 'Vertigo', and I'm left feeling disappointed.Why? Why am I not madly in love with the thing the whole world has touted as a masterpiece? The answer lies in the movie's name and one of its many motifs. Vertigo and spirals. This movie gives the viewer a sense of vertigo, packing many many spirals into its 2hr+ runtime so that by the end... are you truly any further than you were at the beginning? Example: Scottie chases ""Madeline"" around town following her, he then receives a piece of information, deepening the plot, and it starts up the next day, following her around. She falls, gets rescued (one of the most talked-about scenes: sexual tension, desire, lust, giving in, disillusionment, the whole shebang) and the following happens again the next day, with yet another piece of information to deepen the plot. Scottie becomes infatuated with ""Madeline"" and we think little of it, just like his going to Ernies and driving down a row of trees but when all of that happens exactly again later in the film more information has been revealed, the stakes are higher. This whole film is a spiral tightening in on itself. I mean the action the movie ends on is the exact action that occurred during the ""climax"" (middle) of the film. Talk about running in circles.The fun thing about circles, is they're great to talk about, just read some of the reviews for this film, essays they really are. People project themselves onto this movie, some apply 21st-century values on this 1958 film, others attempt to see things from Hitchcock's perspective, everything. I'm not saying that's wrong, everyone's entitled to share how they interpret something! But I haven't found someone that just asks, were you satisfied at the end?Perhaps I'm daft, not a true cinema buff, but for a movie to become a personal favourite for me I have to love the story, not just question it.To conclude though, this film in all its other ways is spectacular. The score, beautiful. There's a point where 20 minutes pass with only a few words of dialogue, all you have is the score and it's magnificent. James Stewart and Kim Novak were incredible in their performances, and the cinematography, well, almost hurts how beautiful it is. Jaws eat your heart out, Hitchcock perfected the dolly zoom. And the use of colours (Green & Red), genius.There's no doubt in my mind I will watch this movie again. There are plenty of things done very well, it just is not an enjoyable movie as a whole for myself.

508,dave_wlogan,What a Ride!,10,3 February 2009,"This movie is One of the greatest movies ever made. In my mind it's certainly Hitchcock's best. To bear that title is showing real merit. This is a director who has many of cinema's classics in his CV. The 39 Steps, Notorious, Shadow of a Doubt, North by Northwest, Rear window and Psycho. Yet Vertigo is by far his most intricate, deep and intriguing film.The plot appears simple. Scottie (James Stewart) is hired to follow Madeline (Kim Novak) who is supposedly insane. They fall in love after Scottie saves her from drowning and then the story turns. She appears to have killed herself, Scottie unable to save her due to his acrophobia. Yet Scottie believes he sees her in a bar and follows this look a like, eventually getting her to dress like Madeline. Then Scottie takes her to the scene of the death with one of Hitchcock's darkest scenes ever.One of the impressive things about Vertigo is that the point of view that the film has changes three times. It starts off being told from Scottie's perspective, before moving to the Kim Novak character and back to Scottie at the end. This makes the film deep and surprisingly fluid. We see Scottie's mental and emotional state deteriorate through the eyes of someone who loves him. This makes the film deeply moving.The film would not be what it is without Bernard Herman's score. And what a score. It emphasises each emotion Hitch is putting the audience through. The excitement of a chase scene, the curiosity while Scottie trails Madeline or the highly intimate scenes between Scottie and Madeline. This is a pure collaboration between Hitch and Herman.Vertigo continues to amaze. It shows he audience one direction down a long highway and then BAM we're in another continent going who knows where. Then it takes audiences where they least expect. A pure example of true art.",Vertigo
509,sausagebrigade,Haunting,9,1 August 2003,"One of Hitchcock's most celebrated movies. Jimmy Stewart is monumental as obsessed cop Scottie Ferguson, trying to recreate his lost love by remoulding a total stranger in her image. Kim Novak plays both roles, and she's better the second time round, as her primary performance is over the top. The most striking thing about Vertigo, though, is the disturbing, multi-colour dream sequences and Bernard Herrmann's mysterious score. A confusing movie initially but it gets better with repeat viewings.",Vertigo
510,orsino44,Superlative piece of cinema,10,11 December 2007,"When I first saw Vertigo, I was too young to appreciate it. Years later, I gave it another look and was totally blown away. I love Hitchcock, he hardly ever fumbled in his entire career, and this is among his very, very best (along with Shadow of a Doubt).Never mind what some have said about Stewart looking too old -- his age is one of the main things that makes this movie work. If Scotty hasn't been around the track a few times, where is the tragedy of his complete and total fall into obsession with a young, beautiful and unattainable woman? In addition to which, JS does some of his greatest acting here. The final climb into the tower is a tour de force, an absolute masterpiece of film acting that has to be seen multiple times to be fully comprehended.Another thing about Vertigo that makes it remarkable for me among Hitch's films: he didn't have some of his usual collaborators here. Vera Miles was pregnant, so her role went to Kim Novak. Barbara Bel Geddes is another unusual (and terrific) choice. Not seeing so many faces I associate with other great Hitchcock films somehow gives Vertigo a special life of its own. Beautifully written, shot, cut and acted and what a phenomenal ending. When there was nothing more to say, Hitch, to his credit, said nothing. (The supplemental ending is garbage.) Take a look at Vertigo; it's amazing.",Vertigo
511,markfinelli,A must watch,9,14 November 2020,"This movie has to do more with obsession and what love can make someone do. At the beginning of the movie, you see Scottie and another detective chasing a criminal from rooftops. As they are jumping roof to roof, Scottie ends up slipping and hanging on the gutter, which is when he began to experience a fear of heights. This fear made him have vertigo whenever he looked down, hence why the movie is called Vertigo. Scottie quit being a detective because he felt if he could no longer help with his new problems.A bit later he was asked by his college friend to follow his wife. The man said his wife was acting strangely and he wanted to know what was going on. Scottie comes to the conclusion that dead Carlotta is taking over Madeleine's mind. While on his job of following her, he did save her life a few times from attempting suicide. While doing so, he began to fall for her.Scottie then believes he should take Madeleine to the old mission to stop this from happening to her. She climbed up the bell tower and ended up dying. Shortly after, he ended up seeing a woman named Judy who looked exactly like his first love Madeleine, and then he wanted to recreate her. He became almost obsessed with trying to make Judy look just like Madeleine.The story only gets better from there, but it is definitely a great watch and a must see! The movie shows great picture and really comes down to love and romance.",Vertigo

The story is just so intriguing! A romantic story of obsession, manipulation, and fear. The acting performances by Kim Novak and James Stewart are incredible, and their chemistry on screen feels so natural. From beginning to end, the film is filled to the brim with beautiful shots, amazing scenery, and an amazing score. The suspense of the film leading up to that shocking ending keeps you interested right up until, well, it happens. Something that really caught my eye was the opening credit sequence.

Now I have had the misfortune to watch it I realise I must have blanked it from my memory or couldn't stick it out to the very end.This has got to be the worst film I have ever had the misfortune to see. The acting was abysmal, complete with silly cartoon facial expressions. Nobody behaved in a remotely believable way and I lost count of the ways in which this whole premise could have collapsed (and in fact did). That it continued to limp on regardless was not to its credit.The story was utterly stupid but worst of all I was bored beyond endurance. This film has nothing to recommend it at all, although I do admit to being curious about what's at the start of the Golden Gate bridge, so there was that I suppose.I don't know what Hitchcock thought he was doing, unless he had dismantled some reject scripts and taped the bits he liked together, or maybe he decided to give a 10 year old would-be script writer an early break.The ending was so stupid as to be unbelievable. By this time I was rather hoping they'd both plunge from the roof and that the awful intrusive violin music would finally stop. If I could summon up any more interest I would look into the early reviews but really, I cannot believe anyone at the time, however gullible, would think this any good.Surely the 10 out of 10 ratings amongst these other reviews can only be because midern audiences have been instructed that Hitchcock was such a master.

The score of the film was beautifully put together and suited the visuals of the film. Hitchcock made sure that the use of color in this film took the lead. His ability to truly let colors set the mood is admirable. Each character was developed in a way that feels different than how characters are typically formed. I would highly suggest viewers to pay attention to colors that are consistently on the screen. Never trusting what you see or think definitely plays a role in this film. Our main characters, Scott and Madeleine, appeal as more than the people we see. They become the colors we see. It is a very easy film to get lost in your head with. It takes some thinking and putting pieces together, but with every re-watch you gain more information about the not one, but TWO twists at the end. Hitchcock almost never disappoints!",Vertigo
520,wrcong,Showing its age?,7,28 December 2004,"I'm not sure if it is the film or me showing age, but somehow this movie just doesn't pack as much wallop as many of Hitchcock's other movies. Perhaps I've seen it too often and my familiarity with the film is in he process of breeding a degree of contempt.Technically, the film is beautiful. San Francisco, ever the photogenic backdrop, provides one glorious setting after another. The score superbly captures the pent-up emotions of the characters as the story unfolds. From there, however, problems begin.As the reviewer ""jrbleau"" noted, the film suffers from a rather implausible set of circumstances. Rather than repeat ""jrbleau's"" synopsis, just this one example will suffice.""Scottie"" is supposed to be an experienced police detective, but his powers of detection seem none too sharp in the plot line. I find it pretty hard to believe that he didn't actually figure out that ""Judy Barnes"" was ""Madeline"" until she actually puts on ""Carlotta's necklace."" Perhaps we are supposed to chalk that up to the overwhelming infatuation/obsession he feels toward ""Madeline,"" but Kim Novak's portrayal of the character does not provide a sufficient spark to carry the day on that score. Their encounters before the first all from the mission tower are really quite bland. Scottie doesn't seem to be overwhelmed by her at all -- just mildly interested.This remains a fine film, but somewhat overrated in the overall context of Hitchcock's body of work.",Vertigo
521,mailbob,Just watch and enjoy,8,11 June 2012,"Every now and then I like to revisit old Hitch – It is part nostalgia, part worship of the old man who never fails to surprise and thrill. There is certainly no director like him. Although I enjoyed it once again, I must admit seeing Vertigo after many years was somewhat of a disappointment. I wanted it to be perfect; it wasn't. Like many of Hitchcock's plots, this one is silly, convoluted, outrageous. But if you stop looking for flaws, what a treat it is to ride with Jimmy Stewart as he (endlessly) drives around San Francisco in his fabulous '58 DeSoto, following the stunningly beautiful Kim Novak in her green Jaguar with the bright whitewalls. This is a period piece with full orchestral accompaniment, with spectacular scenes of the 1950's city by the Bay, some of the sights like the Presidio no longer there, the restaurants, the Legion of Honor, the streets filled with all those wonderful American made behemoths (with an occasional VW beetle thrown in). And, of course, who can forget the famous scenes of the now 75-year old Golden Gate Bridge. Hitchcock of course, was the master of suspense, the unexpected shocker, the moment of revelation. But he also was expert in his use of the camera. Experience the visual, let it roll over you. The acting is magnificent. It is enough reason to see the film just to watch the masters at work: Jimmy Stewart, and Kim Novak in her duel role who as one of the few surviving principals in the film recently paid a visit to San Francisco to display her artwork. But we shouldn't forget Barbara Bel Geddes, the underrated 3rd wheel – she is wonderful in her role as faithful friend Midge. And just for fun: don't miss the old man himself walking by in his traditional cameo near the beginning of the film.The time capsule is amusingly dated, not just for the cars and silly plot: Attitudes depicted are out of touch today: the unselfconscious exploitation of women by domineering men; the almost laughable depiction of psychological disorders (acrophobia/vertigo, for example, is treated as a disease); the effortless instant love at first sight. Flawed plot and dated though it is, it is a nevertheless a simple pleasure to experience the genius at work: Hitchcock, a true craftsman who wasn't afraid to take chances and who strove to keep us hooked until the very last second, always with a sly wink awaiting us. Implausible? Sure. Who cares? For pure cinematic skill alone, I give the film high marks.",Vertigo
522,The_Sun_Toucher,Hypnotic,10,6 July 2000,"The Cinema is often referred to as an Art form, although only a handful of films actually live up to that ideal.  most films, even great ones, are extremely forgettable to all but the most die hard movie buffs. Which is why Alfred Hitchcock's ""Vertigo"" is such a breath of fresh air.  Here is a subtle, suspensful, mezmerising tale told with the patience and sure handedness of a true artist.  At it's heart Vertigo is a tale of deception and obsession.  After the brilliantly exciting opening sequence (which has been ripped off countless times, like much of Al's catalogue) the movie slows down to a steady, almost frustrating pace.  It's main theme develops only gradually, allowing the viewer to soak in every tiny detail of character development. I fear, however, that this film may be too subtle and cerebral for most of today's action obsessed movie buffs, but for those viewers with a little bit of patience and just a drop of thoughtfulness, ""Vertigo"" will prove a very rewarding experience.",Vertigo

Throughout the film, we watch as a job turns to adoration and then to obsession, and it is genuinely spine tingling. The fantastic story is backed up by excellent camera work and cast. The actors are made for their roles, and their chemistry is visible in every line. The color and camera work in this film make it feel at the same time old and modern.

The film would have been much better had it dealt wholly with Kim Novak as Madeleine Elster, but throwing in Novak as Judy Barton is a barely believable add-on to what should have been a wonderfully mysterious plot about a woman obsessed with her deceased great-grandmother.It's also unfortunate that Barbara Bel Geddes was totally wasted in this film. Perhaps pining quietly for a guy who doesn't have his act together (Jimmy Stewart) was the way liberated career women acted in the 1950s  I don't know  but I kept hoping that she would punch him in the face and tell him to grow up.Compared to ""Rear Window"", which is still strong and fresh, ""Vertigo"" seems like it has one foot in the grave.",Vertigo

I like it's use of camera angles and the fact that it's original. However, the movie is hard to understand and it drags on for too long. Not only was this one incredibly boring, it has been mistaken on the Top 250 list. I understand that it is't the only Hitchcock movie on the list, but those movies are incredible compared to this one. I'm a huge fan of Mr. Hitchcocks work, but this one marks Hitchcocks hall of great movies (which there are many) as being the worst. The music is bland, the plot is weird as anything and the romantic scenes left me in disgust that one of the best directors of all time could come up with an idea so creative and turn it into something so BORING.If your a lover of Hitchcocks movies, stay away from this one. 2/10",Vertigo

I enjoyed the heck out of this movie and really found myself analyzing just why while I was watching. After a few seconds or so boiled it down to James Stewart and the director. The film has a great pacing, excellent build up when needed and a story that keeps you wanting to know just enough to make you pay attention. This was my first Alfred Hitchcock movie and after seeing this I'm going to check out more of his movies. The best way to see a good movie is to go into it knowing as little about it as you can so I try not to include details about the movies in my reviews.

And we tend to go out strange things if we have fear so that Hitchcock could be a member of the most famous supervisions. I think that there are some wonderful point in this film. First, shaft of the story is never shake. Of course, to change shaft is terrible and must not do. But I thought again that his film had unity. So it made me be easy to understand the story. For example, green often appeared, so I could notice that the color was key. Second, this film betrayed me in good meaning. I thought that Madeline killed herself first. However it was mistake. The deed was performance. Therefore Madeline was not Madeline. She was a completely different person. I had never thought like that. It was exciting for me, so it impressed me that scene. Maybe everyone also would do. Finally, silent scene was not even boring me. Usually, when the silent scene lasts, I come to be sleepy.

Next, I thought that Scottie was brainwashed by Govin Elster. When Scottie was told things of Madeleine, he saw Judy as Madeleine. Also, he loved Judy as Madeleine. Then I thought that people can't reconsider things if we regard something as particular things once. As a result, Scottie and we thought Madeleine committed suicide. After I finished showing the film, I felt that deceit didn't well. First, Judy change her appearance as Madeleine and loved Judy. As a result, at first, Judy didn't love Scottie as herself, and Scottie loved Judy as Madeleine. Surely, they are poor because they couldn't understand each other and Judy died.

I think one of major theme of this film is feminism. I was so surprised to have put a foreshadowing of phallus: stick and the Coit tower. Also Scottie made Judy like Madeline. This description shows power or freedom of men. I intend that ""Vertigo"" has accelerated feminism movement later. Then still now, we should have a think about states of women with comparison to men. Actually, I couldn't bring myself to this movie. Because the climax rapidly developed and I couldn't understand this film perfectly. Certainly Judy cheated Scottie and she committed serious crime, but she regretted her sin and she looked to be self -examination. So I was so shocked at the end.",Vertigo

533,juliomontoya2000,An interpretation of the end (Spoilers),9,3 April 2006,"I won't make an extensive commentary, but an interpretation of the end.Nowadays, when there's a part of a movie that is hard to understand or put together, it is easily explained through the device (somewhat overused) that it was all part of a dream, or it was all product of the character's imagination When I watched VERTIGO, that's one explanation that I had: everything that happens after Madeleine's suicide (and so, we are stating that HER suicide was true) only happened in Scottie's (James Stewart Character) imagination.CLUES: Just a little after the suicide occurs, there's a trial. Or sort of. I'm not very familiar with these kinds of trials or investigative proceedings, but this one looks very informal. Anyway, the proceeding never leave Scottie out of responsibility. In fact, every time the coroner speaks, he establishes again and again that Scottie's fear of heights produced his lack of will to act, and that in turn did not avoid the suicide of the one he was taking care of.Those words are recriminating, like those from the voice of one's conscience. Next time you see this scene, pay attention and you will hear that the coroner is merciless against Scottie. It's my opinion that in this theory, this trial represents the fight in Scottie's mind against his conscience, that is telling him again and again that he is guilty, What happens after the ""trial""? We see Scottie walking towards Madeleine's grave. This represents him facing the consequence of his acts, facing the need to still deal with it.Was all this a dream, something out of the character's mind? Well, that's what the movie is telling us. Inmediatly, we see Scottie in his bed, as if everything that has just happened came from his subconscious. And then, his mind begins to run wild. He begins to hallucinate.His conscience hasn't liberated him from guilt, and that finally drives him completely mad.Then we see Scottie in some kind of clinic or asylum, completely blank. From then on, we can assume for sure that everything is happening only in his crazy mind.When Midge (Scottie's friend) speaks to the doctor, he says that Scottie has a great deal of feelings of guilt. Now we know that the movie tries to make a big deal about it. Now we confirm that his insanity has been caused by his guilt, and in his mind he's trying to make up a theory that set him free from his guilt.It's kind of strange that after he leaves the clinic, that is, the whole final part of the movie, Midge never appears again. Obviously, she's got no place in the story that Scottie is inventing in his head (it would be logic to see her at least once, since she was his closest friend. But this wasn't the real world...).Since his conscience hasn't liberated him, he has to resort to something else, something that could explain things in a way not only to present him as not guilty, but, even better, as a victim. So then on we see how a conspiracy theory against the real Madelaine, and in turn, against him, is discovered little by little. Or, better said, is invented little by little.The fact that Madeleine, this time as Judy, dies again, can only mean that Scottie didn't find a real answer to his guilt: no matter how he tries to fool himself, he will never get rid of his responsibility. Now, that's a mind playing tricks on you !!!. We can rest assured that poor Scottie never awoke from his madness.Is this theory plausible? I guess so. Could it be contradicted? Yes of course. But then again, all the theories that you could imagine about Vertigo are not flawless, and that's the great thing about this movie: it could mean a lot of things, but those meanings are never conclusive.You can blame too much MULLHOLLAND DRIVE for this kind of theory. But it's interesting to think that movies like Vertigo could have inspired such great style of movies.Of course, some will argue that the final scene that was included in the English version (and in the American DVD as an extra) spoils this interpretation completely. But since it was taken away (by a the director's decision or whomever is responsible), it has left the puzzle incomplete, and so we are left with the option of making sense of it all.",Vertigo

The story has massive plot holes and is incredibly slow I can usually watch slow paced talkies as I've pointed out above I think Under Capricorn is his best film and that's slow and talkie but Capricorn is always interesting and has the fantastic Ingrid Bergman with Joseph Cotton.  For me after Rear Window Hitchcock lost the plot a bit and often his films started to drag with Vertigo and the Birds being the worst offenders.  The only films he made after Rear Window that are worthy of his great name are North by Northwest, Psycho (well the first hour) and Frenzy.

535,dxmmi,"well i was making chilli con carne and did not focus on the movie at all, 5/10",5,23 March 2021,"Here is the recipe:STEP 1
Prepare your vegetables. Chop 1 large onion into small dice, about 5mm square. The easiest way to do this is to cut the onion in half from root to tip, peel it and slice each half into thick matchsticks lengthways, not quite cutting all the way to the root end so they are still held together. Slice across the matchsticks into neat dice.STEP 2
Cut 1 red pepper in half lengthways, remove stalk and wash the seeds away, then chop. Peel and finely chop 2 garlic cloves.STEP 3
Start cooking. Put your pan on the hob over a medium heat. Add 1 tbsp oil and leave it for 1-2 minutes until hot (a little longer for an electric hob).STEP 4
Add the onion and cook, stirring fairly frequently, for about 5 minutes, or until the onion is soft, squidgy and slightly translucent.STEP 5
Tip in the garlic, red pepper, 1 heaped tsp hot chilli powder or 1 level tbsp mild chilli powder, 1 tsp paprika and 1 tsp ground cumin.STEP 6
Give it a good stir, then leave it to cook for another 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.STEP 7
Brown 500g lean minced beef. Turn the heat up a bit, add the meat to the pan and break it up with your spoon or spatula. The mix should sizzle a bit when you add the mince.STEP 8
Keep stirring and prodding for at least 5 minutes, until all the mince is in uniform, mince-sized lumps and there are no more pink bits. Make sure you keep the heat hot enough for the meat to fry and become brown, rather than just stew.STEP 9
Make the sauce. Crumble 1 beef stock cube into 300ml hot water. Pour this into the pan with the mince mixture.STEP 10
Add a 400g can of chopped tomatoes. Tip in ½ tsp dried marjoram, 1 tsp sugar and add a good shake of salt and pepper. Squirt in about 2 tbsp tomato purée and stir the sauce well.STEP 11
Simmer it gently. Bring the whole thing to the boil, give it a good stir and put a lid on the pan. Turn down the heat until it is gently bubbling and leave it for 20 minutes.STEP 12
Check on the pan occasionally to stir it and make sure the sauce doesn't catch on the bottom of the pan or isn't drying out. If it is, add a couple of tablespoons of water and make sure that the heat really is low enough. After simmering gently, the saucy mince mixture should look thick, moist and juicy.STEP 13
Drain and rinse a 410g can of red kidney beans in a sieve and stir them into the chilli pot. Bring to the boil again, and gently bubble without the lid for another 10 minutes, adding a little more water if it looks too dry.STEP 14
Taste a bit of the chilli and season. It will probably take a lot more seasoning than you think.STEP 15
Now replace the lid, turn off the heat and leave your chilli to stand for 10 minutes before serving. This is really important as it allows the flavours to mingle.STEP 16
Serve with soured cream and plain boiled long grain rice.",Vertigo

Not an actual women for who she is. However I did really enjoy the film being in color along with how well it was filmed.

I started off feeling bad for Scottie, but towards the end of the film I really didn't like him. I understand he went insane, but Hitchcock definitely made it hard to like him. I absolutely hated how he treated Madeleine when he found her. Madeleine just wanted to him to love her and was willing to change the way she looked and acted for him. Kim Novak had a hard role to play in this film, acting as two characters that look similar, but are very different. I think she did a fantastic job. Another thing I noticed was that although it was in Technicolor, the colors seemed extremely bright. Was this done on purpose or accident? Overall, I really enjoyed watching this movie, Hitchcock never disappoints!",Vertigo
539,GuilhermeTeixeiraSilva1002,Obrigado Hitchcock,9,10 December 2020,"Considerado por muitos como ""A obra prima"" de Alfred Hitchcock, o diretor em 1958 decidiu presentear-nos com um longa com mistério, dúvida sobre o que está a decorrer na tela e vários twists. O filme aborda temas como obsessão, manipulação, abusos nos relacionamentos e um pouco de ganância. Um dos melhores filmes já feitos sobre a exploração do ser humano e das suas falhas tanto no lado que tenta fazer o bem como aquele que está pelas piores intenções.
Contudo existe um pouco de melo-drama, característica do seu tempo que soou um pouco forçado, mas nada que vá retirar completamente do filme.Nota: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (9.4/10 , para ser chato)",Vertigo

The directing and blocking is superb, just the way you would expect from a Hitchcock film. Although it is considered as ""The Weird One"" amongst all the other cult classics the director made, this film manages to leave its mark on the viewer and Hollywood. We can see fragments of its influence in classic movies from ""Chinatown"" to ""The Sixth Sense"". The control theme is really well-done in the unique story. The final was also very cleverly executed. The only real problem I had with the film was that the story didn't really push itself at times and that made the flow become bare in some scenes. Overall, good watch if you have the time.",Vertigo
541,rajarpitara,"Most probably, the finest Hitchcock film.",10,4 September 2020,"Vertigo is one such film which the critics got completely wrong at the first. But, over the years, revaluation has made Vertigo stand out as one of the greatest films ever made. There is something about the film which makes it obsessive, and it's quite a thing for it concerns obsession too.Vertigo is vastly different from a regular Hitchcock movie. It's full of subtext, and, like all of the great films, it becomes better when rewatched with attention.A feature that is instantly noticeable is the use of colours. The colours used are saturated and in some sequences, which use soft focus, they give a dream like texture which goes completely in line with the character development.The camera work is wonderful, and at its epitome in the final sequence of the film. The way it goes on spiralling the staircases with Jimmy Stewart's character adds so much intensity to the screen. It is immaculately precise in making its choices and follows only the characters which add to the storytelling at the given moment. Never does it looks like the shot is incoherent with the theme and the plot of the film.In Vertigo, so much of the story is just visual. Though, the technical aspects do play their part, but a lot of this must be owed to James Stewart's splendid performance. Equally good are Kim Novak and Barbara Bel Geddes in their roles.Vertigo is a cinematic masterpiece, and one of the reasons of Hitchcock being revered as a ' master of cinema ' and not just the ' master of suspense '.",Vertigo

I've been impressed with a good number of them, but after watching ""Vertigo"" for a 2nd time, I now believe this was Hitchcock's best work, and hence, his true masterpiece. The direction, the style, the story, the visuals, the atmosphere, the soundtrack, the performances are all fantastic. I think it might be James Stewart's best performance out of all the films I've seen him in. Kim Novak also did a great job.

(Psycho and North by Northwest are two other classics that came out around this time- Psycho coming out 2 years later).

It gets in your mind, in a slow, devious and viperish way. Agony and torment is deriving from the human mind - rather than the actual going-ons or plot of the film. It is a film than can be read in many layers, like the halucinational dreams and obsessions of the main character, that linger between reality and fantasy. Reality is what we make of it... and Hitchcock sure knows how to play with the viewers and his characters mind.The best thing is he still remains the master of his kind. MUST NOT miss it.

545,klauskind,"Boy, was I obsessed!",10,9 September 2004,"possible spoilers-Does anyone need another comment on Vertigo? I don't think so. I'll be brief, sort of. Vertigo is the story of an illusion, of something that cannot be had. Scottie falls in love with a woman that doesn't exist so he's bound to lose her every time he falls for her, chases her or simply tries to make somebody else into her. It's not unrequited love or doomed love, it's just love, period, the idea of love, there's nothing else because there is no one to love, just Scottie entrapped in this sexual obsession with no object that can never be satisfied and from which there is no escape. I think that's Vertigo, sort of.So what about Kim Novak? Miss Novak is Hitchcock's MacGuffin, the master's bait, the poisoned ghost he gives to Scottie to feed his imagination but at the other end of the ghost there's a woman, Judy, and she suffers the consequences. If there's a haunted soul in Vertigo is not that of Madeleine but Scottie's. Madeleine is the haunting ghost.Vertigo is a very strange movie for Hitchcock. The plot has more than one hole. Vertigo makes sense for the eyes rather than the ears. But not always in a rational way, not if you think of Novak's make-up. The Carlotta subplot, for instance, are we to believe that Hichtcock is making a supernatural thriller with a Shyamalan twist? If we go along with everything is because we look through Scottie's eyes. To show us what Scottie sees Hitchcock displays a surreal feast worthy of Bunuel accompanied by an aesthetic refinement that would make Visconti eat his heart out. He was no stranger to either surrealism or elegance but I don't think he had ever abandoned himself to his visual instincts in this way. And he had a couple of master cards up his sleeve: a devastatingly beautiful Kim Novak and a peerless James Stewart. Stewart never was a heartthrob, he was the ""everyman"". Could some 50s hunk or some contemporary ""everyman"" have done what Stewart did in Vertigo? I don't think so. He makes accessible what is twisted, rich what is baseless.",Vertigo

I first saw it about a week ago and was confused, but after repeated viewings I understood it much better. Jimmy Stewart was great as always, but it was Kim Novak's excellent performance as Madeleine Elster/Judy Barton that was surprisingly effective. Bottom Line: If you haven't seen this yet, you're in for a spellbinding, suspenseful, and dark film.

548,joughin,Contrived and Schematic,5,23 June 2001,"I'd been meaning to see this film for years, but sorry, I just laughed at the silly end.The Master seems basically to be illustrating some more or less 'Freudian' idea about 're-enactment' (or 'acting and re-enacting', maybe), but cuts (sometimes expertly, of course) an awful lot of corners with the characterization and plot.50-year-old Jimmy Stewart rather suddenly decides he's 'in love' with 25-year old Kim Novak (26 in the film, married for some unexplained reason to a 54-year-old husband - but she's supposed to be the rich one..).  Even more suddenly the 25/6-year old risks a very long jail term (and in fact worse, but I'd better not give it away) by inexplicably 'falling in love' with the rather sketchy character of a stranger twice her age the first moment she meets him.  When she indulges what can only be called Jimmy's necrophilia later on, I found myself just cringing for the actors (who didn't always seem completely convinced of characters and plots either) rather than succumbing to fear, suspense &c.Maybe the world was very different in 1958, but I found what I'd expected to be a masterpiece more like an irritating didactic exercise: an unquestionably brilliant filmmaker subordinates the logic of a film to some half-digested idea borrowed from outside film, instead of finding his ideas in the logic of film itself.",Vertigo

But... I can say that the film is Stewarts way to the death, you can see this from the beginning. There are no way he ever could have been saved. I can say that Stewart (as in REAR WINDOW) looks like a surrogate for Hitchcock. And that is seems to be Hitchcocks most personal film. Actually it seems to be the reality of that time, where Hitchcock desperatly looked for a new Grace Kelly, and drive his actresses to madness with his obsession. Therefore it was naturally that Vera Miles should have played Madeleine/Judy. She was in a another place, as Tippi Hedren later should be, now it was the most a-normal Hitchcock heroine one can imagine, Kim Nowak, who played the part. It seems to be perfect that a ""wrong"" girl has the part. And that she was never a good a actor is not a problem. Yet it had been intresting to see, how Miles would have been in the role, perhaps it was to close the the real world. VERTIGO is a amzing masterpiece (rank it at number 28, as IMDB, is totally crazy) My favoritte film of all time is Rear Window, which is easier tó love, than this haunted film. VERTIGO remains the possible most genius film ever.P.S. Hermanns score is fabolousP.P.S It never manage Hitchcock to find a new Grace Kelly, and after it failed to give Grace Kelly a comeback with MARNIE, Hitchcocks creative gens retired.",Vertigo
551,sledgehammer86,"Illogical, but complete in a strange fulfilling way",10,25 May 2013,"I find it hard to describe what truly makes Vertigo a great movie. In ways, it could even be said that the plot is inconsequential and seems to have a number of plot-holes. But this is Hitchcock, who not always explains everything through narrative, sometimes opting for subtle movements, even moods or colours to connect parts of stories. And in a strange fulfilling way, Vertigo seems complete because of this.Right from the bat Vertigo feels different to what has come before in Hitchcock's oeuvre. The opening titles, Herrmann's music (one of the best scores ever committed to tape), the colours form a hypnotic opening. The movie includes all of Hitchcock trademarks (mystery, twists, suspense, an eye for visual shots, great use of music and technique) but on the whole it feels different. It plays on the mind. The themes of the movie seem to have found their way into the directional style as well: it feels despaired, obsessed, restless. There is an incredibly high number of exquisite locations used here, but this is not just scenery candy. Just like the characters, the movie never seems to settle in one place, always on the move from one place to another (""wandering around"" as two of the main characters say). It is Hitchcock's way of saying that their characters have not found what they are looking for yet. The scenes use colour not as mere wallpaper, but as feeling, mood. The neon colours used in the second part of the movie not only are stunning to look at, but seem to tell the viewer of instability, falseness. Hitchcock and Robert Burks outdid their selves here, upping colour to the extreme.Vertigo is not a logical movie in the sense of straight-forwardness. But it hypnotises and then somehow seems appropriately fitting. On a subconscious level it all clicks. I find myself drawn back to it every once in a few years, still lingering somewhere deep down there in my subconscious.",Vertigo

Well as far as I can tell, Vertigo was not that kind of 'brilliant classic' I heard about. It was a 2-hour cheese marathon without any suspense. The love-story featured in that movie is overly dramatized and absolutely horrible. There weren't any values that managed to impress me. Ironically Alfred Hitchcock defined the term ""MacGuffin"" and Vertigo was a single 2-hours long MacGuffin! There are many better movies which do not get the credit they deserve while Vertigo is called an instant classic. I give it 3 out of 10 because the ending was done very well but if you really want to see a brilliant 50's classic watch ""Witness for the prosecution"" Nuff said",Vertigo
553,Chris-268,Vertigo is NOT a Hitchcock film!,9,24 June 2000,"No, I am not grotesquely stupid.  I realize perfectly well that Vertigo was indeed directed by Alfred Hitchcock.  The point of the summary of my comments is to express my opinion about this fantastic film.A lot has been said about Vertigo on this page, so I will try not to repeat much of it here.  (No spoilers either!)  Many people say that Vertigo falls short of the typical suspense thriller that we have come to expect from Hitch.  And to that I say so what?  So what that the revelation of the murder comes during the middle and not the end?  Hitchcock made a different kind of film here, and I don't think it should placed alongside the body of his work.I first saw Vertigo about 7 years ago with an old girlfriend, who had the bad habit of not paying attention to films.  This particular screening, it rubbed off on me.  After watching it I had no idea what it was about, and always meant to watch it again.  I never did until AMC's recent Film Preservation Festival.  And when I saw Vertigo- paid strict attention to it from start to finish- I was blown away.My advice to people watching this film for the first time is this: if you have seen other Hitchcock films, forget about them. If you've seen Jimmy Stewart films, forget about his typical ""nice guy"" character.  You will get a lot more out of the film if you do. (By the way, I love Stewart in roles like those of L.B. Jeffries and Ben McKenna.)Vertigo is perhaps the most painstakingly detailed film I have ever seen in terms of cinematography.  Each and every shot is a carefully composed painting.  Someone remarked ""Where is everyone else in San Fran?  It seems to be only Stewart and Novak in the whole city.""  To me this is an essential element for the dark, brooding mood of the film.  Because of the starkness, the lack of people in the shots, the film grabs your attention.  Even if the story had been mediocre (and it was NOT by a long shot), I would have been satisfied watching this series of cinematic compositions and breathtaking effects.  It was so refreshingly different from any other film I have ever seen, and I doubt that anything comparable has ever been made.Back to the comparison with other Hitch films for a moment.  When I think of Rebecca, Notorious, and Rear Window, for example, I think of watching a fun, suspenseful film- thoroughly enjoyed from start to finish.  You know who the bad guys are, and you know the heroes will come through in the end.  The beauty of these films is the masterful storytelling, the intricate, almost flawless plots.  Vertigo is not that kind of film.  It was almost difficult to watch, seeing the hopelessness of Stewart and Novak's characters, watching their fates unfold.  And there is plenty of suspense, even after the revelation of the murder.  It is the characters in this case that are more important.  What will happen to them after all the lies and deceptions? The ending is perhaps questionable, perhaps a little too abrupt, but it provoked a strong emotional response from me- an atypical reaction to Hitchcock films.Kudos to everyone that was involved with this film.  I hope to see it on DVD soon, as it seems a film worthy of the spectacular video and audio of that medium.  Vertigo is truly a masterpiece of cinema- and yes, a great Hitchcock film!",Vertigo

For me the film is beautifully shot and flows from scene to scene so effortlessly but that's where the admiration ends.
Sadly though there are too many chronic plot holes and let's just start with chucking a doll off the bell tower?

In Vertigo, there are many something expresses vertigo. When Scottie is caught by something, an object likes appears that likes vertigo. For example, Madeleine's hair, she rolls up her hair, and a spiral staircase. I also notice preparation. Scottie has a stick. When Midge and Scottie are in her room, Scottie finds a bra and he points it by his stick. This scene expresses sex. I think Hitchcock likes preparation.",Vertigo
558,skcn1818,Memai,7,7 August 2014,"I think this film is good. First reason is that many things in it are connected with the keywords of this film, ""vertigo"". For example, images and back music in its opening. Images express a spiral and back music seems to continue eternally so we can feel vertigo like the main character feels in this movie. There are some vertigo shots too. The audience usually knows the character's feelings from what he says and how he is but in this film, we can know it by how camera is moved.Another reason is the structure of its story. In the first half of it, the main person is Madeleine. In the second half of it, the main person is Scottie who is fascinated by Madeleine. The part I was surprised at is that the fact of murder is revealed early in the second half. Generally, the key points in films are revealed in the last scene but Hitchcock didn't do so. Because of it, audience can watch both sides, Scottie who loves Madeleine enthusiastically and Judy who can't forget love for Scottie while we have known that Judy is Madeleine. We can also watch this film while we expect the last scene too.",Vertigo

I can only imagine what people must have thought in the cinema at the time.I guess for anyone who feels the movie is too long and slow and didn't enjoy just didn't get captivated by the tragic romance nor could identify so many feelings in each character. Kim Novak was the mesmerising aspect of this role - totally believable in all her guises, amazing performance.
I didn't think Jimmy Stewart was the perfect kind of person to play the lead role - perhaps too old or too staid, excelling as the likeable everyman but lacking in real open-hearted emotion as is his typical chararcter. But I must say perhaps it's because we are used to this that the film packs an extra emotional punch.I'm still at odd's over the ending. It is so abrupt - why does she react so suddenly to the appearance of the Nun, becuase of the ghostly shilouette. What about the Nun's incredible aloof reaction! Something just doesn't seem fair about this movie, but maybe that is the whole point.

561,Seraphima12,Allure of Mystery and Obsession with Looks,7,11 April 2018,"For me, this is not a typical Hitchcock movie. Though there are mystery and crime elements and also some thrilling moments, the film is more about 'believing what you made to believe to see'. And this makes it more of a psychological drama. Hitchcock cleverly shows us how mystery can lure us in and get hooked. What is more how unsolved mystery can become an obsession driving a man crazy.
Scottie, a retired detective with fear of heights, gets 'hooked' on a mystery of an attractive, seductive and alluring woman. He is lead to believe that she is 'possessed' by the spirit of her great grandmother who committed a suicide. Despite being a detective albeit a retired one, Scottie remains somewhat weak character due to his original flaw - fear of heights which is used by Gavin to manipulate him - and his fascination with the mystery of the woman he cannot comprehend. His non-comprehension of the subject deepens when he tries to recreate Madeleine's look forcing Judy to alter her hair colour and style and forcing her to wear style of clothes that Madeleine used to wear. Scottie is not interested in the real woman - Judy - behind the mask of Madeleine, he is obsessed with the looks of the woman that lured him into the mystery in the first place, trying to recreate exhilaration and attraction he felt. Gavin used Judy to impersonate his wife whom he murdered and Scotties uses Judy to impersonate the impersonated Madelaine. Both men do not care for the real woman. For them she is just a tool.

As the story unfolds there are many twists, however they are taking place sometimes in such a fashion and off time that makes the pace very sluggish and the exhausting experience of watching the entire film makes the ending tired on the one hand and rushed on the other, as the resolution is so overdone even when the last scene is wrapped too quickly, making the viewer feeling empty and frustrated.
I will ignore here the fact that this film is so dated that the sexist tropes are laughable and annoying to watch, especially when Scottie orders around the women on the dress and hairstyle for Judy so that she will look like someone else, but it was filmed in a different era after all.

564,f-odds-1,A masterpiece of torpor,1,5 August 2012,"It staggers credulity to read that this dull, plodding film with its embarrassingly silly plot has now been rated as the greatest movie of all time. I have watched it three times: in the early 60s when it was first released in the UK, again some 10 years ago and once again last night. Nothing has changed. Vertigo doesn't merit high rating even among Hitchcock's prolific output; to elevate it to all-time supreme status is an unspeakable act of self pomposity from the critics concerned.A film like Vertigo depends almost entirely on raising the viewer's interest in its characters. Disappointing, then, that its two principals play their roles as if they're half-asleep on drugs. James Stewart has many times played with success the seemingly slow-witted, slow moving character who's aware of a lot more than it appears. In Vertigo this Stewart stock persona is inappropriate. One wonders if they first shot the scene where he's mute, staring and unresponding in the hospital and he decided to continue in this mode but mouthing the script lines as they came along.How anyone could begin to fall in love with such a frigid, boring personality as played by Kim Novak is beyond comprehension. She is consistently out-performed by trees, buildings and props throughout the piece. Far from conveying an intriguing, sexually arresting character, she leaves the viewer marvelling that nobody thought to save budget by substituting a tailor's mannequin.Had Vertigo been directed by anyone without Hitchcock's reputation (one that's deserved but which, most unusually, seems to encourage enthusiasts to believe he never makes a clunker) it would have been written off as poor stuff — indeed it was correctly regarded as mediocre when it first came out. It isn't a bad film, in the sense of godawful, laughably inept. It's just so far from good that people with normally functioning eyes and ears will shrug and say ""ho-hum!""",Vertigo

567,y-melon0326,Good organized,8,16 September 2014,"I watched Alfred Hitchcock's films last year and studied about them. This summer, I wanted to watch some of them again so I chose this film. When I finished watching this film the first time, I could not understand its story and thesis so I watched it several times. While I watched several times, various ideas passed through my mind and some interrogative points were left. First of all, I found various interesting points in this film. It repeats the same story. Although sometimes lines are changed in the first and second halves, the same story is repeated twice. In spite of it, why do we lose interest? I think this is because of a good organization made by Alfred Hitchcock. While this is a suspenseful film, he reveals a secret in the middle of the story. The story is suspense told by Scottie at first, but it becomes a love story which is told by Judy in the latter of the story. I think because the similar story is written from a different viewpoint, we don't get tired of it. Finally, I totally recommend this film because it has a nice structure and we can study a lot of things from it. This film expresses various issues such as moral matter, fetishism, occultism and so on. These are complexly intertwined and formed a large spiral. If we watch it only one time, we don't understand its good point because, as you know, its theme is death and it's not comfortable. However, if we watch it several times and consider what Hitchcock wants to tell us and the meanings of each scene.

568,sassonlonner,People Call Hitchcock One of the Greatest for a Reason,10,26 April 2018,"SPOILER FREE REVIEW:Hitchcock is considered one of history's greatest directors for a reason. Watching through Vertigo one time straight through gives an amazing experience. The characters are intriguing, the plot is suspenseful, and has many twists and turns, like you are falling through spiraling mayhem.****************************SPOILERS AHEAD********************************* From the beginning of the film we have one of the greatest opening credits sequences of all time. The close up shots of a face, followed by spinning shapes and spirals. As irrelevant as this credits sequence may seem the first time around, it quite literally delves into the mind of Scottie (James Stewart), our protagonist. The way he perceives Madeline (Kim Novak) is not as a person clearly, but for who she is as an object. He doesn't see her as a full person. That is why from the opening credits, we see features of a woman on there own, separate from the rest of the body. These spirals represent how Scottie feels with the chaos ensuing in his life throughout the film, and his vertigo.
 
 Another brilliant subtle use of imagery in the film is with color. In particular, the colors red and green, for stop and go. The first time I watched the film, this imagery totally went past me. Although I was in a class where the teacher was analyzing the film, and this suddenly became almost too obvious. In nearly every scene featuring Scottie and Madeline/Judy, the colors red and green are very present, whether it be the lighting in the space, their clothing, the wallpaper the room, or even something as simple as a reflection.
 
 The one element I didn't love in Vertigo which many people would disagree with is the ending. I really loved the buildup as Scottie follows Judy up the tower in the final scene, and he slowly builds up in his anger revealing he has caught on to the whole scheme, but I found the very ending bizarre, and was given no good explanation to it. My assumption was at the ending there would be some sort of intense final dialogue between Judy and Scottie at the top of the tower, and Scottie would dramatically either commit suicide, kill Judy, or just something very intense, but the way that Judy dies didn't make much sense to me, or make me feel the film had a satisfying ending. She dies because some nun we've never seen before startles her. Why does this happen and what does it mean? I read somewhere that she thought the nun is a ghost, but why is that relevant? When the movie ended the first time I watched it, I thought to myself, that was weird, although I'm sure I'll find some complex mind blowing explanation online. Nothing. If someone can link me to a great explanation of who that nun is, and what she represents, it would be appreciated.",Vertigo
569,Dwolvesbane,"Overrated, but still good.",6,15 December 2008,"Vertigo is highly touted as one of the greatest works of renowned filmmaker Alfred Hitchcock, and though it is a great film with many merits, there are elements of it which diminish its luster a bit.The rising action of the film is very well constructed, with the mystery of Madeline's behavior revealing itself and then uncoiling in a slow and deliberate way that builds the suspense that one suspects from Hitchcock. The story and intrigue layer and build until the fateful scene in the mission stairwell. The moment of Madeline's ""suicide"" feels very much like the climax of the film, and indeed the film seems about to end when Scottie is placed in a mental care facility (And the film could well have ended there and been quite good.), but it does not. Instead a sort of second story arc begins with Scottie released from the hospital and running across Judy at Ernie's. This discovery leads to a series of ""make over"" scenes in which Scottie attempts to transform Judy back into Madeline. Scotties motivation in these scenes can be a bit hard to place, making this section of the film difficult to follow for some, and can be quite discouraging to less diligent viewers. Those who do have the fortitude or curiosity to endure are treated to a wonderful twist ending that firmly snaps the section of film in question into perspective.The film deals rather unabashedly with the issue of obsession. The main characters in the film are either possessed of or develop strong obsessions that ultimately lead to their undoing: Gavin's desire to kill his wife, Scottie's obsession over Madeline, and, even though it is later revealed to be non- genuine, Madeline's obsession with Carlotta Valdes.A visual aspect of Vertigo that bears mentioning, aside from the now famous ""trombone"" shot, is the use of color in the film to define and separate scenes from one another. Various color palates are used in different locations such as the yellows of Midge's apartment, the red of Ernie's, or the whites of the various mission houses.Overall, a great film worth viewing, but perhaps a bit overrated.",Vertigo
570,MaccyXpert,Deservedly labelled as one of the greatest of all time,9,23 November 2017,"So this is often labelled as one of the greatest films of all time; I haven't seen enough movies to agree or disagree, but it's definitely one of the best movies I've ever seen. Alfred Hitchcock is at his best with this suspenseful mystery, unraveled by a retired detective being the subject of merciless mind games. The story and direction are nearly perfect and the mystery is solved with appropriate pacing and character development (mainly Scottie, the detective, and Madeleine, his target). The movie lets the audience figure out parts of the mystery for themselves (so there's lots of, ""OH THAT THING,"" moments, which is the movie engaging the audience and making the viewing experience even better). The effects and music are excellent - my favourite scene is Scottie's nightmare where he looks into the grave (you'll find out) and falls into a spiral with flowers transforming into colours and all this beautiful stuff (it's 1958, so you don't even expect much, but Hitchcock nails it with stuff that looks better than some of what you see today). No scenes in the film feel out of place; there's no bad or unsuitable moments - whenever the film's not being brilliant, it's still very good and sustains itself well. The lead performances are great, especially Stewart's (he plays Scottie), who works in the unfortunate victim role brilliantly, with his acting of fear and nervousness being the most notable parts. Their romance is steadily driven along a fine line with over-sexualisation on one side and being annoying on the other, being perfectly woven into the story and seeming entirely human (doesn't even seem like a movie, given how their relationship develops with Scottie's behavioural changes). The only potential problem would be people not fully understanding the mystery (I did, and people should put in some effort to process events and connect the dots themselves because films - especially masterpieces - rarely explain everything explicitly).",Vertigo

It is deeper than almost any other film ever made, and is complimented by an incredibly good Bernard Hermann score and great acting by James Stewart. However, I have one question: In the first 45 minutes or so in the movie, right when James Stewart is first hired to follow Kim Novak's character, who is it that he sees in the window of the old hotel? I have watched the film many times and have not been able to figure that part out. Anyway, this is a masterpiece on many levels.",Vertigo

I mention this because Novak at Columbia was showcased and at Paramount where this film was shot Kim was unprotected and vulnerable. Also Hitch's often comment he meant to cast Vera Miles was again something to get under Ms. Novak's skin. There is no way #1 Box Office Star Kim Novak was preferable to the lovely Vera Miles.

It's the most beautiful and romantic film ever, but has an utterly black heart. That's why, like the ups and downs of the human heart, it's as much comic as it is tragic. The ending is perfect precisely because it is such a cop-out, leaving us as (and Scotty) just as stranded over the abyss as we were at the beginning. To love this movie you have to understand it.

577,essmeier,One of the Master's weaker efforts,3,13 September 2000,"""Vertigo"" is often hailed as a masterpiece, but it's difficult to see why. The film runs 128 minutes, but feels like 240 while it pursues ultimately unimportant mysteries involving long-dead non-characters.  The logic-defying plot, as many have pointed out, is convoluted to the point that it makes almost no sense, and the abrupt ending comes out of nowhere.  The ending is so bizarre that I couldn't help but burst out laughing the first time I saw it.  Stewart's performance is OK, but his character borders on the psychotic, and one can't help but wonder why Novak didn't just tell him to get lost.  Barbara Bel Geddes turns in a nice performance, and then abruptly disappears for the last half of the film.  Herrmann's score is noteworthy, but not as memorable as those of ""Psycho"" and ""North By Northwest.""  I've seen 35 of Hitchcock's films; this one ranks near the bottom, right alongside ""Rich and Strange"" and ""The Man Who Knew Too Much"" (1934.)  Pass on this one; try ""Frenzy"" instead.

No gimmicks here, just an enigmatic tale of love, lust, betrayal, and a mystery that envelopes one with a feeling of being in another world.  So many classic scenes that it is no wonder it consistently shows up on top ten lists.  If anyone isn't swept away by the performances and the intrigue of the plot, they should go so their doctor to see if they are still alive. The one scene that really gives me the feeling that there are metaphysical forces at work here is the one the in redwoods at the center of the film.  Many cite the scene in the small hotel as a pivotal part of the plot, the point where Scotty (Jimmy Stewart) has finally lost himself to his compulsion.  Kim Novak plays her character exactly as Hitchcock intended and she was perfectly cast.  She never came up to this level again in her career.

It seemed impossible that he was saved since he had a ""Vertigo"" and no help was no near. But somehow the movie continues without explaining how
he survived or who saved him.2. The character Midge Wood (ex-fiancée) gets introduced to the story. Midway through the film she leaves the film and we never hear from her again. What was the point of her being in the movie in the first place? Did Hitchcock really need this person to exist so that the protagonist can explain to the audience what being afraid from heights means?This list could be larger but I think I made my point clear.

It influenced me to settle in San Francisco, as it is indisputably the ultimate San Francisco movie, with Bullitt a very respectable second. I have personally visited almost every real location depicted in the movie, and I love to give my out of town visitors the Vertigo tour of the places that still exist. Vertigo is a great tour of some of the many beautiful spots in and around SF.I love Alfred Hitchcock films and though Rear Window is my favorite, I think Vertigo is his best and perhaps most personal. From the opening titles and wonderful Bernard Hermann music soundtrack to the haunting conclusion, Vertigo is a visually lush and grandly entertaining example of masterful storytelling. I cannot articulate enough how great this film is and do it justice in 1000 words. The viewer is drawn in voyeuristically with the Jimmy Stewart character as he feels the tension of escalating obsession and the just-out-of-reach frustration with an unobtainable illusion. The use of music is one of the best ever in film as it reflects the inward emotion perfectly. You can hear what Jimmy Stewart is feeling. First there is curiosity, then rising tension, rising hope, and then release and resolution. Vertigo has one of my favorite film shots in it too (possibly the first time it was ever used), the zoom-in-while-backward- tracking shot, later seen in films like Jaws. Oh! And Vertigo has one of the greatest on-screen kisses of all time too, so very passionate (and I think shot on a turntable). The way Alfred Hitchcock was able to imply such sexuality in Vertigo without showing even nudity, I think, made the situations even more sexually charged, as what one imagines is far better. This is a film that earns a rare but well deserved 10/10 in my book.",Vertigo
583,Piperson,A policeman with dizzy spells thinks he is tracking a woman possessed by a suicidal dead spirit and he gets more than he bargained for.,10,4 January 2017,"Let's hearken back to a time when you couldn't have seen this movie unless you had seen it on its first run. Can you even imagine such a thing? Movies have reputations and legends spring up around them. In 1966, this movie was not one of those.I first saw it about a decade after its release. I saw it in the auditorium of my all-girls Catholic high school with 400 screaming girls who, like me, were surprised and overwhelmed by what we saw.The suspense and shock was increased greatly for me and all my friends because of the difference between what we expected to see and what we got to experience. This was a very conservative Catholic school and seeing a movie was a rare treat. The movie we had been subjected to the year before was a real stinker with a moral (Your parents are doing their best so you should obey them in everything even if they are wrongheaded and negligent.)So how did it happen that the nuns this year allowed us to see a tense wild tale of obsession and unpunished murder? The only explanation is that somebody goofed.The Sisters of the Holy Name who ran our school had roots in the Bay Area. Some of them were homesick for Marin and San Francisco. So the way Vertigo was selected as our annual movie, I imagine, was this. One of them read a synopsis and ignoring the parts about sexual obsession and wife killing only noticed that there were scenes shot in Old San Francisco and San Juan Baptista. Add in a scenic drive through Monterey and it was practically a travelogue with the Presidio and Coit Tower.My friend Patti and I were so engrossed in this viewing of Vertigo that we never forgot it and can instantly crack each other up by bringing it up. It was wonderful. We had come in late after lunch because we spent the end of the lunch hour dumpster diving for Patti's retainer which she had carefully wrapped in her napkin and thrown away for the third time that year. We had to sit on folding chairs in the back so we could clutch each other (not that way) and pinch each other to make sure this was really happening. This means that I wasn't paying attention to whether the nuns were in attendance. Something tells me that they were there because they didn't want to miss out. I hope they were there and I hope that they were as gratified as we were. I doubt it but I hope they were. And I hope that the homesick goofball who recommended it didn't get into too much trouble.

584,Beren,Greatest American movie of all time,10,26 September 1998,"Vertigo is the greatest English-language movie of all time.  It goes deeper than any other film and its exploration of obsessive love should be required viewing for anyone concerned with the human condition. Unfortunately, it's also a vastly under-appreciated film.I've seen Vertigo in the theater maybe 9 or 10 times, more than any other movie.  The audience is always on the verge of booing at the end.  I can sympathize with them.  I didn't like it the first time I saw it either.  The movie has a major plot twist about three-quarters of the way through and an ending that is anything but traditional Hollywood.  Hitchcock's Psycho also has a big plot twist, but it happens much earlier in the story, and Psycho is more superficial and less emotionally involving.The second time I saw Vertigo, its greatness came through and I was able to appreciate it for the masterpiece - and I don't use that word lightly - that it is.  All the things that moviegoers may object to - the slow pace, protagonist's breakdown, non-happy ending - they're all integral to its greatness.

588,orcrush,I just don't get it,2,18 August 1999,"This opinion might get me kicked out of any film criticism class, but I absolutely loathed 'Vertigo'. It is manipulative, dreary, and completely unlikeable. The first hour or so is spent with Jimmy Stewart on some wild goose chase following a friend's wife to see if she's possessed by a demon(?!?). For some inexplicable reason, he falls in love with her. Once we reach what we're first to believe is the climax, we learn he's been duped somewhat. As have we. The last 45 minutes certainly move more fluidly, but Jimmy Stewart's character becomes so obsessive and controlling, he ought to have been served a restraining order. If I seem a little vague in my analysis, there are two reasons for it: 1. Revealing any plot points might be considered a spoiler, which I'd never do even for a movie I hate, and 2. the movie itself was vague. There is never a logical explanation given for anything that occurs.I have now seen 27 Hitchcock films, and without a doubt, this would rank as #27(just behind two other overrated films, Psycho and Lifeboat), although, in all fairness, I don't count Torn Curtain or Marnie since I fell asleep in the middle of both. So, if you want to belive hype over quality, then by all means, rent Vertigo today, and watch one of our greatest actors wallow in a storm of hopelessness. My advice is to see Rear Window, Hitchcock and Stewart's *real* masterpiece.",Vertigo
589,mrsweeneytodd,Personal doesn't even describe(spoilers),10,25 April 2000,"To start out, I am fascinated with this movie.  I love Hitchcock, and everything he has contributed to cinema, but something about this film transcends what he has contributed.  I have read the critiques of those who dislike it, and I can totally understand.  This is not Hitchcock's normal standard, it's not the edge of your seat thriller(well, not all of it), and the pace is dogged at points.  But when I sit back and watch this, I cannot help but sit back and be entranced by the pure beauty of this film.  The bridge shot, the redwoods, the revolving kiss, all are incredible, lasting images.  The delicately provocative and yet eerily haunting music is unforgettable.  And like these ideas, the theme of being haunted, plagued by some phantom ideal such as mislaid love that emcompasses every moment of your life, the obsession and self-mutilation that everyone endures because of it - every romantic can sympathize with these themes.  One thing that is often overlooked is the depth of Stewart's character, and the emotional heights which he is more afraid to fall from than tangible heights in his own life.  And when he DOES fall, and he realizes to what depths he has been tricked, he snaps, not realizing that Novak's character has as well fallen with him.  His depravity and obsession with the truth at the end as they climb the stairs is one of the greatest scenes in film - he overcomes his actual fear of heights and confronts his emotional downfall, just as the the personification of both his previous weaknesses and what helped him to overcome them.  The final image of Stewart standing atop that tower, the shadow of death tolling the bell as he looks down upon what he has lost to his vertigo, is so disturbing and haunting that it brings me to tears every time I watch it.  This is my favorite movie of all time, not simply because of any one specific element, but because it inspires in me something unexplainable, like looking at a painting or listening to poetry, only one-hundred times more potent.

593,Bogie27,A dizzying Achievement,10,3 February 2011,"A down on his luck and retired police detective is given a call by an old college friend. The friend wants the detective to follow his wife, as he believes she is in danger. Reluctantly he agrees to take the job. Through a foggy San Francisco he follows a beautiful woman on a circuitous trail impossible to believe. Many would recognize this, as the work of one the greatest cinematic masters of our time, Alfred Hitchcock. The film is Vertigo.Vertigo is a film about obsessive love, loss, guilt and betrayal. Disguised as a psychological thriller, and perhaps ahead of its time, Vertigo released in 1958 with only moderate box office success and mixed reviews. When Hitchcock did North by Northwest a year later he chose Cary Grant over Jimmy Stewart as he blamed Stewart for Vertigo's financial problems. Today Hitch wouldn't be disappointed – Vertigo is often referred to as a Masterpiece and has risen steadily through the years in critical acclaim. Barbara Bel Geddes as Midge and Jimmy Stewart as Scottie Fergusson, play a lengthy introduction scene in Midge's apartment. It's a colorful apartment for a contemporary professional girl of the late fifties with a lovely picture window view of downtown San Francisco. We enjoy being there, and a sense of normalcy prevails. They chit chat about old friends, careers and brassieres and we realize that we are voyeurs here. What we also realize in this lengthy character building scene, is that this sense of normalcy cannot last for long. After all – this is a Hitchcock film. The suspense is already building.The story gets a little darker as Scottie meets with an old college friend, Gavin Elster. Elster wants Scottie to follow his wife as her movements have become mysterious. Initially Scottie resists the offer, but after Elster pleads with him to take the job, Scottie agrees to covertly meet Elster and his wife at Ernie's restaurant. One look at the woman and Scottie is hooked. Kim Novak is stunning in this scene. The effect she has on Scottie is clear from the beginning. Stewart was perfect as the 'everyman' and often played roles where an average guy gets caught up in something bigger than himself and turns out the victim. So much imagery in the film is circuitous in nature. From the spinning graphics in the opening credits to the circular path of the green Jaguar around the streets of San Francisco and the spiral bun in which Carlotta and Madeleine wear their hair. Everything is moving in circles, and like a whirlpool the victims are drawn toward the center as the bottom begins to drop. The first victim is Scottie. The musical score composed by Bernard Herrman cannot be over emphasized. It is an emotional and hauntingly beautiful score that is perfectly coordinated with the thematic elements of the film.At this point in the film Hitchcock shifts gears as the film picks up speed. Scottie follows Madeleine to a flowers shop where she gets an odd bouquet of flowers. Kim Novak protests the gray suit with her platinum blond hair in this scene, but Hitchcock insists. It is a woman dressed like this coming out of a San Francisco fog that Hitch had envisioned for Madeleine. Many scenes were shot with a fog filter if natural fog was not available. From black and white dreams to full color dreams, Hitch portrays this story in a dreamlike fashion and he uses color or the lack of it to help the story along. As Scottie follows Elster's wife Madeleine, he comes to her assistance as she has an 'accident'. He takes her to his apartment to recover. Watch Stewart very closely in this scene as he expertly plays the part, very warm and friendly, but never forward. The view outside Scottie's apartment window is a photographic plate of a street scene, where the cars never move and people never walk. It's clearly not natural, but perfect for the dream-like story Hitchcock is telling. Scottie is falling for Madeleine, and she senses this and tells him she's married. He doesn't seem to hear, as her beauty is beyond reason and the words fall upon a deaf ear. Scottie and Madeleine begin to wander together in their daytime drives around the bay area. They stop along the northern California Sequoia forest and then stop at Cypress Point along the shore. They stand closely together as the waves crash on the rocks below into a large crescendo. In this close-up scene Hitchcock uses a 'process shot' or rear screen projection. It's not quite natural, but we have to realize Hitchcock is not trying to take us there – the background is for Madeleine and Scottie and not for us as he retells this dream-like story.Hitchcock reminds us in Vertigo, that what we fall in love with is strongly connected with what we choose to see. Like the circuitous imagery in the film, the plight of Scottie is also duplicitous. The film has been restored in the late nineties by Universal Pictures. If you've seen this film 20 or 30 years ago on television, you owe to yourself to see the restored version today. Hitchcock was always fond of using rear screen projections and photographic plate backgrounds, but they were especially effective when used in Vertigo. Like the background scenes, the use of color, picture definition and dynamic ranges of light and dark, were not effectively presented with older forms of television.",Vertigo
594,eddie_olsen,My favorite Hitchcock,10,18 October 2009,"What a movie! Like the other Hichcock classics made around this time the atmosphere is so evoking. It is difficult to determine how he accomplish this. It's probably the mix of a unique story and clever lines.You need exceptional acting to deliver these dialoges. And both James Steward and Kim Novak does it with perfection. Not to say that the film is especially talky. There are also scenes where Hichcock uses silence to make the film a puzzling mystery. Especially the scenes where Madeleine Elster is sitting lost in her own thoughts.As in many other of his films the female character suffers from a bizarre obsession. Hichcock is THE master of portraying extreme personalities in a believable way. The reason is probably that he also show their more normal and rational side. The frustration of falling in love with the wrong person is a central theme in the story. The theme is common, but is given a unique and refreshing treatment.The suspense is pure miracle! Highly recommended.",Vertigo
595,robelanator,overwhelming,10,11 October 2005,"The score, the post-transformation kiss, the ending. I've seen Vertigo six times now and it still thrills me.James Stewart is just plain brilliant as Scotty. He starts off as a light-hearted, good natured guy and becomes very manipulative, very single-minded, very scary, very un-Stewart-like. And yet, even as he's leading the woman he thought he was in love with up the stairs in an emotionally manic frenzy, Scotty's still a completely sympathetic character. He's manhandling Judy, screaming at her, and at that moment you can really *feel* that his heart has been ripped from chest. You don't want Judy to come to harm, but you can't begrudge Scotty his rage either. Whatever happens, you know there can be no happy ending. And as Scotty stands in the bell tower looking down at his lover's corpse for the second time, you and he are utterly crushed. Now *that's* cinema.",Vertigo

597,francpsantos,"People say beauty is in the inside. In Vertigo, it's everywhere",10,8 November 2018,"Apparently there's a reason why, in a medium where everything is extremely subjective, this film is always on the top for so many people. If I'm allowed to say, it is truly objectively a masterpiece. Usually when I watch a movie there is always that one scene that sticks with me afterwards. A few minutes in, the scene at Ernie's kicks in and I think to myself: This is it. But then there's the whole pursuit scene, the museum, the nightmare sequence, the final transformation of Judy in Madeleine, and so on, and so on. Everything is so beautifully engineered to elevate the tantalization of Madeleine that one can't help to participate in Scottie's obsession. James Stewart is stellar, as usual, but Kim Novak can just merge an uneasy eerie feel with that strong magnetism, while still keeping it convincingly real. And of course it had to come to that end. After all, life goes in cycles, right? All of this the fruit of an extremely well designed plot by the one and only Master of Suspense. Let him take the credit he deserves, but don't forget that the man surrounded himself with the right people. The cinematography by Robert Burks is, to this day, the closest I have seen to the meaning of ""every frame a painting"". I mean, I had never realized I wanted so badly to visit San Francisco (which almost feels like character in itself). And don't get me started one the score. Many say that, since Herrmann couldn't conduct the orchestra in this movie, it doesn't have the same feel. But honestly, it doesn't really matter to me. It is so well embedded into the plot, the characters, the scenery, that, just like the city of San Francisco, feels like a conscious character. Most of the times, this may go unnoticed to a great deal of people, but I dare anyone to try to watch this movie with no soundtrack and I assure you it won't be nearly as striking.""Only one is a wanderer; two together are always going somewhere""",Vertigo
598,wildduck-1,dream vs. reality,10,28 October 2005,"Warning contains Spoilers - Hitchcock beautifully explores the need for illusion in Vertigo. Scottie, played by James Stewart, is a man who drifts without direction, who can't make up his mind about anything. He is deeply dissatisfied with the real world. He seemingly has a choice between two women. Midge is open, practical, and unexciting  a representative of life as it is. Madeleine is exotic, mysterious, complex, a perfect fantasy figure. He falls in love with Madeleine and lets her lead him into her world of drama and illusion. She becomes, for the audience as well as for him, the wish fulfillment of the dream woman. Two-thirds of the way through the movie, having strongly tied us to this character, Hitchcock betrayals us  she dies suddenly and inexplicably, we are disappointed and confused. We are, surprisingly as disoriented as Scottie is. Soon after, Hitchcock explains what has happened, and we realize that we have been deceived, with Scottie, by a cheap trick. Neither audience nor hero wants to believe it. We both want her back. We prefer the illusion, false as it is, to the reality. Through Scottie we are made to see and feel the consequences of rejecting real people for a dream. Judy, a graceless, uninteresting girl, has been impersonating Madeleine all along. Still obsessed with Madeleine, Scottie forces Judy to recreate her role for him. At first she resists, wanting to be loved for herself, but then, like so many of us, she agrees to conform to his image of her. Otherwise she will lose him.",Vertigo

600,jsgam,The Paramount of Hitchcock films,10,1 May 2020,"I'll never forget my first time seeing this one. I watched it when I was 16 and was enamored by he suspenseful romance.While many will cite either Psycho or North by Northwest as the greatest-of-all Hitchcock films, my vote would go to Vertigo. Jimmy Stewart works so well with the classy Kim Novak. The colorful style (especially in regard for a film made 62 years ago) fits so well in a world of romance. I personally love the scene in the beginning where Stewart is trailing Novak in the car and we see San Francisco in all of its vintage glory.Vertigo is arguably the greatest detective story, even beating Polanski's Chinatown in my opinion. This film has everything from a grade-a star list, the Hitchcock fun, the excitement, the drama, the beautiful shots of Golden Gate and the psychedelic paranoia scene with Jimmy Stewart's head in focus (it may look a little silly by today's standards, but it shows how the film is a great vestige to the past.With regards to the paramount of suspense, the horrid ending with the nun ringing the bell as his lover falls to her death, we know full well that Jimmy would never recover from a situation like this in real life. We may think of classic films as being more tame with regards to content, but this is a really disturbing story in its own way and we understand that Jimmy probably spent many years in Mental Health Hospitals coupled with intense weekly therapy.",Vertigo
601,veramkaufmann,Beautiful movie with flawed choice of lead,8,2 March 2016,"This is a film that bears repeated viewings. The idea of questionable identity is used to explore love and the way love feeds itself on difficulties and distance and is destroyed by availability and banality. Jimmy Stewart stars playing against type as an apparently easy- going man who becomes obsessed with Kim Novak's elegant woman obsessed with a tragic past. The film provides a character study that focuses on his attempt to reassert himself as a man after a humiliating failure at work due to an attack of vertigo, and the infantile aspects of his character particularly in relating to women.Besides the mind-bending character of the film, it's beautifully filmed. Even as it seems to critique good old ""Old San Francisco"" and (then) modern San Francisco as similar to the present in cruelty and unfairness, it is also an escapist fantasy of mysterious secrets, beautiful women, plush restaurants with red interiors, wood paneled offices of shipping magnates, rolling hills, old cloisters, redwoods, etc. The biggest flaw of the film is Jimmy Stewart. Although in some ways he is excellent in the part, implying both an ""aw shucks"" affable surface and a self-centered, callous, immature aspect underneath, at the same time, he is supposed to be the object of affections as well as the subject, and this doesn't seem as plausible given that he looks too old and his mannerisms are somewhat comical.Also the psychological analysis of ""vertigo"" and the cartoon dream sequence both feel dated now.This film is a ""must see"" but - like the ideal beauty of Scotty's dream woman - there are certain aspects that can't be dwelt on too much or it falls apart.",Vertigo

For me, this is one of the best films ever- and indeed for a lot of others. James Stewart plays his reliable, good guy character- but something about his character is so unsettling. The way his actions mirror Hitchcock's own.You can never stop analyzing this film and its never ending meanings- sure, it may be jam-packed full of phallic imagery and clever metaphors, but it is a great movie before you even try and delve into its hidden meanings.

But does he give it? not all of it which keeps me guessing, and which keeps other critics guessing.Meaning, my guess can be better than yours, and vice versa, so the interpretation of this film (filmwise) can be very subjective, but nothing to fight and debate about. Ultimately the focus of film should be the literal film itself and what is being shown in the big screen and not the meaning or the interpretation. Script was excellent, lovable and amusing. Acting except for the kissing in the beginning part, maybe coz I wasn't the guy of that time, I just thought that the kissing was bad, James Stewart didn't know how to kiss the beautiful lady that well, it was a little awkward for me. But as the film continued it got better.Cinematography was very good, didn't realize San Francisco was that amazing, before I die I want to visit that bridge and maybe go for a swim, hoping someone will save me. ^^Music was mysteriously amusing, and Im guessing it didn't take that much money to make this film, and yet it was good.

Today I watched it through the eyes of a 50 year old man. This is quite different and changes my opinion, and what I am viewing.
Alfred Hitchcock was angered by the performances of the two leads, was angry at the studio, and the critics. I think the leads were perfectly cast. Jimmy Stewart had to be a man we believed would believe anything, when under the spell of Kim Novak. She had to be both beautiful and approachable. Cold, yet a woman you would want to wrap your arms around.

615,francodelrosario,"Eerie, Electrifying, Pleasantly UnsettlingA Genuine Thriller of the Highest Quality",10,17 April 2006,"Initially unprofitable at the time of release, VERTIGO may now be well-considered Alfred Hitchcock's most riveting masterwork and possibly his best. Told with such somber menacing tones, it establishes an overall ambiance of suspense and anticipation. With its premise taken from French novel ""D' Entre Les Morts"", it was executed exceptionally by the Master himself. It blends an outstanding revised screenplay, distinguished cinematography and noteworthy acting between two renowned leadsall intensified by a legendary Bernard-Hermann score.John ""Scottie"" Ferguson is a retired San Francisco officer regularly suffering from acrophobia leading to the demise of one coworker. Hired casually as a detective by old schoolmate Gavin Elster (Tom Elmore), Scottie is asked to track Gavin's voluptuously icy wife, Madeline (Kim Novak). Gradually, Scottie is enticed by the unstable Madeline (whose suspicious behavior may be attributed to a dead ancestor's possession over her). Madeline then fatally plunges off a bell tower with Scottie helpless to save her and VERTIGO deviates completely. As Scottie, inebriated with angst, recovers from his loss, he meets Judy (Novak), a saucy brunette resembling the lost Madeline. He forcefully converts her physically to remind himself of the departed Madeline, leading to an alarming conclusion.No other picture embodies the persona of an indisputable Hitchcock suspense story as well as VERTIGO does. In this terrifyingly personal movie, Alfred's passion to alter particular characters is exposed here. Another great aspect is how every meticulous detail, the lighting, the makeup, the score, the set etc., takes on significant meaning. The film boasts of numerous transcendental, platonic and emotionally devastating scenes. Among the well-known visuals, scenes and sounds first seen in VERTIGO, which are nowadays frequently used as homage, include the simultaneous zoom-in-zoom-out shot, the Golden Gate Bridge scene and the classic background music of Bernard-Hermann. We see that Hitchcock is truly the Master of establishing character development, mounting tension and pacing virtually everything in the silver screen. He successfully plays mind games with the audience until a shocking revelation four-fifths way into the film and even then we are still left guessing.Only Jimmy Stewart can portray such an acrophobic private eye plagued with desire and necrophilia and make him as down-to-earth as Scottie. Kim Novak, in one of her most prominent roles, stars in a dual character conveying two opposite extremes. The way she plays a glacial elusive girl on one hand and a brassy independent woman on the other is remarkable. Both actors easily depict how two Hitchcock's characters are forced to run in a merciless, never-ending spiral of lust and deceit.Surrealistic yet believable, VERTIGO is the supreme thriller, that induces delightful terror into the audience. Only this movie can bewilder and bamboozle even the most persnickety critic.Worth mentioning also is Barbara Bel Geddes' underrated performance as the ""normal"" predictable woman in Scottie's life, Midge (whose love interest is none other than Scottie)",Vertigo

This movie was robbed of the Oscars in 1958! However I'm not going to describe the movie as it MUST be seen. But for those who have seen it did you notice the second more subtle plot twist? It occurs after the scene when Scottie is in the hospital suffering from a mental breakdown. Notice how Midge does not appear in the movie again! In fact, the second half of the movie after that point, we are actually seeing what is going through Scottie's head and how he copes with his circumstances. Notice also that when the main Jury person is speaking he says that Scottie's previous weakness made the policeman fall to his death. You see Scottie comes to terms with his personal disasters by assuming the role of the person he could not save. What I mean is that it was the policeman who was hanging from the roof in reality but Scottie could not save him because he was looking down at the officer. He later reverses roles with Mrs Madeline Elster after the hospital scene. Now tell me how much of a genius Hitchcock really was!",Vertigo

622,simest,The Jewel Amongst Hitchcock Jewels,10,3 January 2021,"Of the many classic works that form the celluloid legacy left by Alfred Hitchcock, critics have long debated which could be deemed the quintessential Hitchcock movie.......the one that might best encapsulate the unerring deft hand of the oft-titled Master Of Suspense.
There are certainly plenty to choose from. SHADOW OF A DOUBT (1943), ROPE (1948), STRANGERS ON A TRAIN (1951) and REAR WINDOW (1954), all exhibited a unique blend of suspense and macabre humour toward the subject of murder, that audiences in the 1940s and 50s had not experienced before. NORTH BY NORTHWEST (1959) meanwhile, offered espionage, mistaken identity, romance and thrills in what is one of it's director's most flamboyant and fast-paced offerings.
Then there is PSYCHO (1960), a film whose reputation stakes a claim as his defining work - partly for the controversy it courted at the time of it's release but undoubtedly more so for the generations of audiences it would terrify and make think twice about stepping into a shower with it's familiar shrieking strings unleashed by composer Bernard Herrmann.
In 1963 he shocked moviegoers again with THE BIRDS (1963), a spectacular entry of sorts in cinema's animal-amok sub-genre that has still only since been rivalled by Spielberg's JAWS (1975).
In 1958 however, Hitchcock made arguably his most complex and multi-layered movie. A film about desire, love, obsession, phobia, loss and redemption.
VERTIGO stars the ever-reliable James Stewart as confirmed bachelor Scottie, a police detective whose discovery that he suffers from acrophobia - caused by a form of vertigo - leads to the death of a colleague at the start of the movie. Guilt-ridden, he retires from the force but is shortly thereafter hired privately by old college pal Gavin Elster, to secretly follow his wife Madeline who appears to be suffering blackouts and exhibiting odd behaviour that she has no subsequent memory of. Behaviour that indeed, threatens to end in her suicide. A suggestion of possession by a long-dead descendant who died at Madeline's age by her own hand is put by Elster to Scottie, who is sceptical and dismissive of such a notion. In following Madeline however, this theory begins to look more and more credible as her unbalanced behaviour increasingly replicates that of her descendant - a descendant of whom she herself has no knowledge.
Played in fittingly aloof fashion by the icy-elegant Kim Novak, Madeline soon becomes Scottie's object of desire but this is only the beginning. What lies ahead is a labyrinth of twists and deceptions that lead Scottie into an odyssey of love, madness and obsession by way of a tragedy from which he has to recover his sanity to somehow face a future that appears once again shattered by his vertigo.
It is at this point where James Stewart really comes into his own, playing a deeply troubled character in a role unlike any he had previously been assigned (or indeed would ever be again) throughout a remarkable lengthy career. That Hitchcock was able to extract this range from him is a credit also to the director. Guilt, failure and an undying love for a spectre of his past follow a mental breakdown and form an obsession to mold the present back to a point in time where Scottie can escape the tragedy consuming him. In a bizarre twist of fate he then seemingly happens upon an unexpected second chance to redeem himself and undo the loss and despair that haunts him. In making this journey, Scottie will try to rewrite his past to reclaim his life, his love and his sanity. In doing so however, will the outcome offer deliverance..........or will he only capture an illusion?
To reach the moment of truth he must ultimately again face his vertigo.
Throughout the proceedings, Hitchcock's storytelling techniques have never been better. Colourful swirling, kaleidoscopic patterns accompany the opening credits, underscored by Bernard Hermmann's exceptional main title, conjuring a surreal, illusory quality that perfectly sets the scene for what will follow. A nightmare sequence during the depths of Scottie's despair builds on this with striking imagery, reminiscent somewhat of Salvador Dali's concept work on Hitchcock's earlier SPELLBOUND (1945). Great use is also made of authentic San Francisco shooting locations that here become mapping points in Scottie's experiences with Madeline.
Arguably most memorable of all, is the hotel sequence in the latter stages of the film. The pivotal moment where it seems Scottie might defeat his demons and reclaim what was cruelly stolen from him. Shot with filters and washed out with neon lighting glaring in through the window from the hotel sign, the scene has a disturbing sickly quality to it that appears to replicate Scottie's troubled state of mind. It is undeniably sumptuous however and culminates in what was the longest on-screen kiss filmed up to that point, achieved with a lengthy continuous take circling the characters while the background locations alter from one to another behind them. All this accompanied by Hermmann's remarkably moving romantic score.
VERTIGO is possibly Alfred Hitchcock's most ambitious work and is undoubtedly among his very best. Essentially it is a tale of one person trying desperately to chase the past while another tries in vain to escape it. Though the story elements may be at times implausible and collapse under close scrutiny, it is the thoughts and questions they provoke that endure and resonate. Where does love begin? Where does it end and obsession start? Could desire be an age-old insanity?
Are there really ever any second chances in life?",Vertigo
623,Brian-9229,A Timeless Masterpiece,10,25 July 2017,"Vertigo is without a doubt Hitchcocks finest masterpiece. I believe the score to be Bernard Herrmans masterpiece as well. This film is just absolutely perfect in every single scene. To call this film personal to Hitchcock would be a huge understatement, as so many of Hitch's attributes shine through every scene. The restoration is beautiful and the resulting blu-ray is gorgeous! There's a few 'minor' nitpicks but, nothing to detract from the overall experience. There is one strange occurrence that was not noted in the official review that happens when Scottie and Midge are at Argosy's book store. Halfway through the scene i noticed it start to get dark and darker and darker until it looked liked the lights were turned off in the bookshop. But, when Scottie and Midge leave, the light in the bookstore brightens back up. Very odd. I imagine it could be due to the restoration and severe degradation of some elements. What was done in the restoration is beautiful though, especially the coloring. Gorgeous!",Vertigo

But ""the master of suspense"" offers more style than substance here, leaving the viewer with nothing but vertigo. The swirling opening credits, the hypnotic soundtrack, the dream-like pastel look, the unusual grey tone of wardrobe and back-drops. Is Hitch trying a Douglas Sirk (director of a number of stylistic melodramas of the 1950s) with all this stuff? Then going a little deeper, are we made as obsessed by Madeleine (Kim Novak) by seeing James Stewart's character trailing her on foot and by car for much of the film, with NO suspense or drama? We have to be, or it doesn't work. It didn't for me. (NO SPOILERS) In what might be called the second half there is a moment when we are made aware of something. You'll have to decide if this is shown too soon, as it was for me. Also, why would the husband want to kill a wife that looked liked Kim Novak in the first place? How does Stewart's character survive his fall (not shown) from a tall building, receiving only a broken leg? Didn't others see changes in Madeleine? Hitchcock falls short, this time.",Vertigo

I have seen it twice; didn't like it much the first time, but liked it even less the second time.It's very well made, and has some great scenes (the opening credit sequence is mesmerising, as is a strange dream sequence later in the film), and, as one would expect from a Hitchcock movie, there is considerable suspense at times.While it starts out okay, it descends into tedious self-indulgence and melodrama.

These two sequences clearly foreshadow the protagonist's ultimate fate, even though this is not clearly apparent in the final shots.Hitchcock's choice of Jimmy Stewart as the lead was a good move in my opinion. His performance has the right amount of vulnerability and courage. Kim Novak is also very good as the tormented ""ice maiden"". All in all, an amazing film!",Vertigo

He starts to follow her, and falls in love, but he's being played. With so many reviews about this film, what else can be said, except a review of the reviews. Something I see a lot is people using the wrong yardstick. If you grew up on modern Hollywood and have the attention span of a 3-yr old, this will seem like a slow tedious film. However, if you have a taste for great film, you will understand why its rated so highly. Not only is the plot well written, but there are subtle things in the development of events, his wanting to bring her back, the process he goes through to figure it all out, and the horrible twist at the end.I wouldn't say this a favorite film of mine, but I can certainly agree that it is classic to watched and enjoyed as it slowly, yet entertainingly unravels.",Vertigo

Gets everything technically perfect except the premise.Even if he was running some insurance scam, dude, you've got to believe the actions he followed were the stupidest you could possibly think of.Here's what the Bad Man does in the movie:1. Includes an accomplice to murder2. Dresses that accomplice up as his dead wife3. Does endless research for backstory to make suicide look like a ghost possession4. Thinks ghost possession is better a suicide story than just you know, sadness5. Requires his accomplice give Oscar-caliber performances to a detective so the story isn't suspect6. Directly links himself with his murder via his witness, Joe Detective7. Has a romance with his accomplice, then dumps her8. The wife is already dead. He had already found a way kill her, and the best suicide idea he had was throwing her off of a church? It wouldn't be easier to just put a gun in her hand and pull the trigger? Why couldn't his mistress be a witness? Why is a witness even necessary?9. Mastermind's best plan was to hide at the crime scene in a janitor's closet while cops surrounded the jointEssentially the bad man goes way out of his way to create some implausible elaborate way to frame his wife's suicide involving another man's fear of heights, a female co-conspirator / mistress, a backstory involving ghost possession and a detailed history of his wife's specific family background up to and including hereditary mental illness.

633,Arun145,A masterful display of suspense and illusion,8,9 December 2016,"Vertigo is a film I enjoyed very much. It takes what could have simply been a very average story and transforms it into a fascinating look at the human condition and how it deals with grief. Hitchcock is one of the great auteurs of cinema and he shows us why with this film, he is constantly changing the tone of the film and yet it never feels muddled. He combines genres including, Romance, Drama and Thriller; this may not seem a huge achievement but it paved the way for many filmmakers of the future to mix genres. Jimmy Stewart has a very challenging role that I believe he plays perfectly, the subtle change from private-eye to hopeless romantic is actually believable. Kim Novak is also superb as a woman with much to hide. The ending was my only problem with the film, it feels incredibly sudden and more of an exit route for the writer as opposed to an actual conclusion to the film. Nevertheless, I would certainly recommend it to any film fans as a must watch film given how much it has influenced cinema since its release.",Vertigo
634,suburbanpineapple,You like Vertigo because Hitch directed it!,1,14 December 2006,"This may come as a shock, but you have a warped perspective. Shocking isn't it? You thought you were making decisions about films using your own opinion and feelings, your not. You like Vertigo because Alfred Hitchcock directed it. Hitchcock who directed Pshyco and The Birds, two other films you love purely because of Hitchcock's master direction. Im now going to show you that Hitch isn't a master director, far from it. You have been brainwashed by the cult following that heralds Hitchcock as a genius of cinema. With a genius everything he produces is gold, sadly Hitchcock does not qualify for this status because Vertigo adds itself to the list of poor films that plague the auteur's career.In terms of a coherent plot you can forget it; the film opens with the unnecessarily dramatic beginning that is full of enigmas to keep your interest - the fact of the matter is that this is the only way he can keep your interest, and the stroke of 'genius' that allowed him to leave most of these enigmas unresolved just adds to the horror that is Vertigo. The plot rides on these enigmas until, inevitably the audience begin to loose interest, but don't worry with a master like Hitchcock at the helm surely he'll be able to save this with a clever technique; unfortunately not; instead James Stewart's vertigo is used again and again just as the plot begins to thin. This however, is not the full extent of the problems that have ravaged this film. The fact that the audience are supposed to suspend their disbelief so that James Stewart is able to 'not realise' the woman at the beginning is the same one as the one at the end is frankly insulting.If you have any sense of pride, or dignity, or, well let's face it any self value whatsoever you will avoid this film as it assaults all five senses, often at the same time, leaving you with a desire to end not only your life but those of everyone involved in both the creation and appreciation of this film.",Vertigo
635,Lord_Borrington,Surreal masterpiece,9,1 August 2017,"Not very popular with critics or audiences when it first came out, probably not what they were expecting form the master director. Certainly a very different movie not in the usual Hitchcock formula. The movie probably needs more than one viewing. I can understand why some people don't like it much, but if you can get into the mood and atmosphere it's a surreal masterpiece. The movie is really about creating a surreal dreamlike world to enter. Set in San Francisco in 1958 it is like nothing before or since. Unforgettable and mesmerizing it is full of great locations, strange characters and stories. We go on a strange uneasy journey with Jimmy Stewart where there is no return and end up somewhere between sanity and insanity. Everything about this movie goes together to create another world which you feel like you have entered, the music, the 1950s grainy film, the dull colours, the incredibly shot locations, the changing light. It is certainly a strange movie hard to put into a box. It is from another time. Amazing. Like a dream... A classic film from the golden age of Hollywood. A Hollywood which doesn't exist anymore.

636,eveflower1970,Beautifully Twisted,9,28 December 2018,"Two years before Hitchcock's legendary horror movie ""Psycho"" (1960) hit the theaters, our Alfred stunned audiences with another masterpiece. Perhaps not as dark, cruel and shoking as ""Psycho"" (1960) or ""The Birds"" (1963), ""Vertigo"" (1958) still manages to be called a timeless classic.First of all, Scottie's condition allowed the use of an entirely new camera technique. ""The Dolly Zoom"" is one of cinematography's most impressive camera tricks. Years before Steven Spielberg used it in ""Jaws"" (1975), Irmin Roberts was the first cameraman to ever use this technique, in a Hitchcock film.This movie tells the story of Scottie, a retired cop who's asked to investigate the case of his friend's wife, which seems to be possesed by the spirit of a dead young woman who committed suicide.As the chilling story goes on, several moments of suspense accompanied by chilling musical scores are happening. If you're not a fan of it, you can still enjoy the superb settings throughout the movie, and as well the beautifuly filmed shots. These elements alone are a pure work of art in my opinion.Because it's a 50's film, you will encounter extravagant dialogue between the characters, that still manages to look natural. It's not over the top forced as you may see in other films of the era.Toward the end of the movie, I appreciated the interesting depiction of madness that Alfred creates throughout dreams and illusions that our leading man deals with.
The beautiful lighting used in the last half an hour of the movie is also outstanding enough to be mentioned.
And, without spoiling anything, I'd like to mention how from my perspective, the leading man portrayed throughout the movie as a tragic hero, becomes an antagonist.Definetly an unpredictable and stylish classic you don't want to miss.",Vertigo

Hitchcock's crowning achievement. The acting by Jimmy Stewart, Kim Novak, and Barbara Bel Geddes is extraordinary. The music pulls you into the oddly hypnotic suspense even further. The cinematography is so beautiful and so vivid that it adds more depth to the film. It's almost as if it's the fourth character of the film.Both leads played two parts in the movie. Jimmy Stewart as the calm and mostly collected former detective, and Jimmy Stewart as the unhinged madman trying to get back to his Madeline. And Kim Novak as the beautiful wife of a former friend of Scotty's, hauntingly possessed by the spirit of Carlotta Valdez, and as the ""tawdry"" (original trailer's description of her character) redhead from Kansas.Haunting, hypnotic, beautifully strange, suspenseful and unhinged all are descriptives that can easily be used to describe this wonderful film.

But in fact these scenes are necessary for the whole movie to work. And by the way, the beginning is not boring.

As is typical with our favorite director, Hitchcock creates his art without cutting back on entertainment, which is why so many consider him motion pictures' greatest film-maker. First time and repeat viewers of Vertigo are compelled to continue viewing Hitchcock's film until the chilling, unexpected end. Vertigo's conclusion is anything but satisfying but rather a life-changing slap in the face. It is probably the greatest film ever made. Stewart and his costar Kim Hunter also give their greatest performances. Barbara Bel Geddes's small supporting performance is equally effective. Hitchcock's incredible eye for landscapes is never more keen as it is in Muir Woods, a California Mission, and around San Francisco.

This makes it altogether and pleasantly different than other psychological thrillers.You would have to appreciate the legendary director for this masterpiece, the background score, the use of colors, the sombre evening scenes and overall direction is unmissable.I was really intrigued by the lead actress Kim Novak, She is beautiful, mysterious, innocent and confused at times and you would want to see more of her. She looks like someone for whom someone would lose his mind.

It is more of a work of art from Hitchcock and, as been noted by others, a very personal film. This film is about compulsion, obsession and of having , what is to Scotty, the ideal woman in his grasp, only to lose her in tragic circumstances. It is also about guilt, bereavement and murder. Even after Madeleine's death, Scotty cannot let it go. He continues to search for a ""dead"" woman. He is almost willing to go to any lengths to recapture what was lost. But as the old saying goes...""be careful what you wish for""?Hitchcock's direction and screen composition is right on. The art direction and color schemes are fantastic. The setting and filming of San Francisco, magnificent. The performances are fantastic all around. However, despite all of the above, the one factor which really sets this film apart as a ""classic"" is the Hermann score. It is truly great and captures and adds to the mood and tone of this film in all of its facets.This film should definitely be rated higher on this site.

Why? there are thousands of reasons: Starting from the opening titles, Saul Bass put us directly in the spiral of love and death that is Vertigo, also with the red eye. The screenplay is perfect, each image, look, note from the great Bernard Herrmann's soundtrack, color, or any ditail in the screen, is correlated with all the story and gives it a tremendous dimension. There is a fact that, assuming that is a classic movie, reveals that it´s breaking with the way to tell stories of the classic cinema. When the film seems to be over with the fall of Madelaine from the tower, Hitchcock goes further and another film bagins. The point of view changes from Scotty to Judy, and we now that Judy is Madelaine but not Scotty.

644,bigrab65,Great in every way,10,8 August 2003,"Some Hitchcock films can be viewed by some as little more than thrillers.  A case in point is Rear Window.  This is not the case for Vertigo, through and through a work of art cinema. What makes this film stand out is how Hitchcock uses all of the film-makers to perfection: acting, storyline, music, editing and so forth. The film's use of lighting is excellent throughout, always echoing in some way the psychological state of the characters.  The graveyard scene, where Hitchcock used fog filters, is one of the best examples of this.  The fog effect gives the viewers a number of different feelings: the obvious is to give a ghostly atmosphere to the scene.  It also gives you the sense of ambiguity about Stewart's actions at this point of the film. The film features arguably the most dramatic ending in the history of cinema.  What we have here is every aspect of film-making coming together, with Stewart acting at perhaps a level of intensity that has rarely been matched before and since.  The film famously ends with Kim Novak dying, however why is this the case? Vertigo is effectively split into two halves, before and after Stewart thinks Novak has died.  What is clear is that these two halves are rather like an image that has been reflected and rotated in some way.  We have Stewart now making over Novak's character.  Stewart making it to the top of the stairs and so forth.  It is this type of role reversal that requires Novak to die.

I'm not sure why it took me so long to get round to seeing one of the most lauded Hitchcock films but I think it was because it was so hyped and people said that it was edgy and artistic that I thought it was pretentious bullshit and didn't really fancy it. I went into the film thinking it was going to be good but that it was over-hyped and there was almost no way that it could live up to my expectations. I was mistaken. This film is a masterpiece and I absolutely loved it. Now, I'm not going to wax lyrical about the camera techniques or anything pretentious like that because that's just not what matters to me in a film. I rate films based on how captivating or enjoyable they are. I would give this one 10/10 on both. I have noticed that the reviews that ""hate"" this film complain about people who like it being pretentious and deluded but I noticed that they cannot offer a reason why the film itself is not good. They just criticise the fans of this film. That's where I reckon they are trying to be edge-lords and rebel against the acclaim this movie has received. I'm a firm believer in not judging a film by its fans. Perhaps the fans of this film are pretentious but that doesn't take away from this exceptional film itself.

What makes the film excel above the rest is the plot and the acting. Vertigo isn't over-blown. It isn't about world espionage or psychotic killers or deadly birds and wheel-chair bound voyeurs- its as if Hitchcock became reserved, mature. People who find it boring or slow just cant get over the childish stories they're used to hear in Hitchcock movies. In this one we get the real stuff- not psychology as an excuse for a murder story but a murder story told as an excuse to a moving story of one very broken man's obsession (the WONDERFUL James Stewart, who's every face gesture can stand for a thousand words in this film) and his object of affection- the beautiful Kim Novak.

660,tjackson24,my vote for the best of hitchcock,10,29 January 2002,"all great movies must be seen at least twice to understand how great they are. that is true in spades for vertigo. the story is smart the first time through. it's brilliant the second time through. the first time through we're identifying with scotty as he tries to find out what he needs to know. our knowledge is equal to his. but we get ahead of what he knows when we hear judy write her confession letter. now we know more than scotty and our knowledge is aligned with judy. so we begin to watch scotty to see if and when he'll come to know what we and judy know. the second time through we identify with madeline/judy as she tries to keep acting her assigned part while falling in love with scotty, so we watch to see when she begis to be NOT acting the part, which is to say resisting the role she has willingly taken on. the heavy irony is that as she struggles NOT to simply play her assigned part (because she's falling in love with scotty), she in fact seems all the more convincing IN the part. and then when she is judy, to pump up the irony even more, she has to struggle to play the part of who she really is. she has to pretend to be herself.

However, in this one, not only does the hero struggle with his physical vertigo, but he becomes hopelessly mired in a mental verigo from which there is no reprieve.  No hand will ever reach into that darkness to pull him to safety.Scotty's inability to release Madeleine mirrors the obsessive madness of Mrs. Danvers as she stirs up the ghost of Rebecca.

I watched Vertigo with admittedly high expectations, and was more than a bit disappointed with what I found.  I admit Jimmy Stewart gave a fine performance, and so did the other actors, but none of them gave a great performance. Most of the plot is rather confusing and coupled with the ending makes even less sense.  I just couldn't believe anything in the movie could actually ever happen, and so it was missing that touch of realism that most Hitchcock movies have. Hitchcock did a fine job directing and Jimmy Stewart did a fine job in his role, but the plot was silly and there was plenty of padding as well (I hope you like scenes of people driving).  Hitchcock and Stewart made this mediocre movie into a good movie, but it is definitely not a great movie.Final rating: B",Vertigo
666,andros12,A Vision of Vertigo,9,15 October 2005,"A woman's face greets the viewer upon the film's opening sequence. The camera moves up from her lips and settles upon her eyes as a whirlpool of concentric colours begin to appear, becoming more and more beautiful and guiding the viewer like a hypnotist's timepiece into the depths of the subconscious mind.""Do you believe that someone out the past, someone dead, can enter and take possession of a living being?"" This question becomes the pivotal inquiry of the entire film as the rational, level headed detective Scotty is slowly but fatefully drawn into a swirling vortex of fragmented images contrasting the past and the present, love and reason, fate and free will, and life and death.After an old college friend named Gavin Elster asks him to investigate the activities of his wife Madeleine because of her strange obsession with her deceased great-grandmother Carlotta Valdez, Scotty reluctantly agrees to help. He is unaware that the woman that he is made to believe is Madeleine Elster is in reality an impostor named Judy Barton who is Elster's mistress and co-conspirator in the planning of the murder of the real Madeleine.Scotty's investigation into the activities of Madeleine's impostor lead him to a flower shop and then to the graveyard tomb of Carlotta. Back in the car he is led to an art gallery where he sees ""Madeleine"" seated in front of a portrait of Carlotta. He notices that she carries a bouquet similar to the one Carlotta holds in the portrait and that she wears her hair in a similar French twist. The woman subsequently drives to the San Francisco Bay area where she leaps into the water. Scotty manages to perform a heroic rescue. He takes the girl back to his apartment to dry her clothes. The stage has now been set from a series of disjointed visual images provided by a well manipulated setup of ""coincidental"" meetings to an episode involving actual verbal communication and Scotty is well on his way into a vortex of illusion. The young woman begins to convince Scotty that her motives to commit suicide are driven by the actions of her Great Grandmother who died by her own hand many years earlier at the similar age of twenty-six.Hitchcock makes great use of imagery, colour and costuming in presenting his film. For example, the vertigo effect appears repeatedly, from the initial swirling credit patterns, to the near-death rooftop scene, to the disintegrating floral effects during the wonderfully orchestrated Scotty's nightmare scene, to the tunnel-like vision of the hallway during Midge's visit to Scotty's doctor and, of course, to the final mission tower sequence.The colour green is strongly used throughout the film. Madeleine's impostor drives a green Jaguar and various tones of green reoccur continually as the movie progresses. Her character is initially resplendent in a green gown and later upon her initial introduction as Judy she is wearing a forest green dress. The prevalent use of the green symbolism creates images strongly representative of the continuation of life theme that is reinstated during ""Madeleine's"" visit with Scotty in the forest and their discussion over the cut down coniferous ""evergreen"" tree. Madeleine's impostor also makes effective ""ghostly"" appearances wearing a gray suit and also a white coat with a black scarf, both costumes wonderfully contrasted against her platinum blonde hair. Like a vapour she sometimes makes momentary disappearances, on one occasion from a hotel and on another while walking in the forest. There are some interesting shadow shots of her as well, one as she stands in the doorway upon a late night visit to Scotty, another in profile as Judy Barton in her apartment and perhaps the most effective shot is from behind as she sits on an old fashioned carriage at the mission.After Scotty fails to prevent ""Madeleine's"" suicide, she appears by ""chance"" on the street wearing a green dress as Judy Barton. Scotty eventually attempts to ""remake"" Judy (clothes, hair, make-up) into his vision of Madeleine and for a while he appears successful. One night, during preparations for dinner at Ernie's, a nightspot where he first gazed upon her as ""Madeleine,"" he discovers that Judy is, in actual fact, wearing Carlotta's portrait necklace. Scotty then drives Judy to the mission tower where ""Madeleine"" died. In an attempt to overcome his fears and to be ""free of the past,"" he forces Judy to the top of the tower. During the resulting physical and emotional altercation he sometimes calls her Judy and then Madeleine. The identities have become a blur; the vortex effect has once again enthralled him. Judy confesses to assisting in the murder of the real Madeleine and pleads for protection. The shadow of a nun climbing the stairs appears to frighten Judy off the ledge and she falls to her death from same tower from which the real Madeleine was thrown.The film's impact is primarily upon the subconscious mind, probing questions about the nature and reasons for interactions with select individuals, their impact and the role they play in the blueprint of our lives. The film opens the door to speculation about the connection between the past, present and future and the role that single and collective perspectives have in determining our experience and destiny. Finally, the film asks the age old question; is the survival of consciousness a reality and are life and death simply doors of admission to interconnected ongoing realms of possibility?",Vertigo

668,cmdev,Some of Hitchcock's worst work,3,11 August 2021,"There's a lot to say about this movie, and not much of it is good.The first half of Vertigo watches more like a travel documentary of Northern California. It's like Hitchcock was asleep at the wheel. Things start to pick up in the second half, but any emotional stirring they might have hoped for at the climax is ruined by the unconvincing romance between the two leads. The casting choices are absolutely the worst part about this film. James Stewart and Kim Novak have no chemistry whatsoever (which isn't helped by both leads' sleepy acting). On top of that, the age difference in their ""romance"" is downright creepy. My heartstrings remained thoroughly untugged. I was honestly more interested in the unexplored relationship between Scottie and Midge than in the main romantic plot thread. James Stewart is a fine actor, but he was best utilized in more grounded, rational roles. I just don't buy him as a deranged lunatic.It's not ALL bad- the cinematography and set design are better than Hitchcock's average, and the plot had lots of potential with some fun twists. I just don't undertand why people think this movie is more than it is on its surface. The rest of the movie is slow, boring, flat, and just downright bad.People analyze this vapid melodrama to death looking for some reason to justify hailing it as some kind of groundbreaking masterpiece. They fixate so much on its godlike reputation, and the quirks, like the dolly zoom and the use of color ""symbolism"", that they don't realize it's not actually that special. I guarantee that if someone else besides Hitchcock directed this movie, it would have been forgotten decades ago.This film's entire reputation is a sham.

671,seanlee,Character development makes Vertigo great.,9,17 January 1999,"People who express disappointment with Vertigo likely miss the point of the film. The name Hitchcock is synonymous with some of the greatest suspense stories ever to grace the silver screen. Yet as a conventional murder mystery, the suspense in Vertigo falls short as the mystery is revealed halfay through the film. To those who look for a Psycho-like whodunit, the last hour of Vertigo would inevitably seem anti-climactic. The revelation midway through the film, however, was exactly Hitch's intention - it prompts the audience to focus on the complexities of the characters, and in particular, Judy. A humble girl is given the role of a lifetime in Vertigo. Like a starlet who peaks too soon, Judy becomes haunted by her single, solitary role. Hitchcock poses an important question for the audience of  Vertigo 'Why can't we fall in love with the same woman?' For what is the inherent difference between Madeleine and Judy? Though both characters are played by the same woman, the division between Madeleine and Judy is one of social status. In Vertigo, as we frustratingly watch Judy refuse to become Madeleine, Hitchcock prompts us to confront our own fixations with superficiality and status.",Vertigo

It is my favorite film and in my opinion should have been rated much higher in the AFI's top 100 movies of all time list.  It outdoes Psycho and North By Northwest even though those are superb films as well.  I realize that Psycho set standars for years to come, and North By Norhtwest set standards for script-wrting, directorial techniques, etc....but Vertigo was simply a masterpeice made.  Nothing was revolutionized (except Hitch's technique of falling bodies), but instead a wonderful movie was made that can show just how much the human mind can toy with feelings and emotions.  Not only is the cinematography and acting remarkable in this film, but the heart-breaking score by the great Bernard Herrmann would also have to be the high point in this film.  When you listen to the score, you feel all the emotions that are running through the film and through the charachters head.  Never before could this have been expressed in a film, and it has never been done again in film.  There have been many attempts and superb films as well that have tried to express the same emotions--but none have succeeded more then Vertigo.  This was Alfred Hitchcocks personal favorite of his own--and I do not blame him.  All elements come together:  James Stewart and Kim Novak's electrifying performances, Bernard Herrmann's legendary score, the superb scenery of San Francisco, and the love and passion expressed through the chracters by a remarkable script.  The thing to top off Vertigo is the scene where Judy comes out of the bathroom and reveals herself as this illusion woman (Madeline).  There is so much passion in this scene it truly has to be one of the most remarkable scenes in the history of film.  When one takes all these elements into hand, Vetigo can without a doubt be considered one of the 3, if not the greatest, movie of all time.",Vertigo
678,phteven_hawking,Not Hitch's best,4,18 August 2010,"Do not be fooled, this is by far Hitchcock's best film.I think this has a lot to do with the bare naked screenplay stripped of its social context. Which you may think is unfair. But a film in the modern era does not rely on the life-story of the director or the 'readiness' of current society to appreciate it.Perhaps Hitch was opening himself up in a way previously unseen, perhaps the film was 'off-the-wall' for the audience of the time, ushering in a new era of film-making, but let us look at this thing as a single, self-contained package. It fails dismally.The screenplay and story-line have so many holes and inconsistencies, very rare for Hitchcock, that make this film, regardless of intellectual depth, an inferior film. Regardless of how much you may 'like' or 'get it' in this film, these cinematic faults cannot be denied and rob the film very easily of its title as Hitchcock's greatest, or even as a great film, which it certainly is not.It is not a great film, perhaps a good one, but certainly not great, or even very good. It is mediocre, and we only need to reveal Hitchcock's very own admission that James Stewart's casting was an awful and unforgivable mistake that makes the entire situation unbelievable. Merely the surface of the films atrociousness. This lead actor was ridiculously miscast and that the Director of the film did not do something about it at an opportune time speaks volumes about the sloppiness of this work.Vertigo is a one of the saddest indictments of humanities willingness to collapse its opinions under the pressure of authority. An authority which started with one positive review of the film in the late sixties, a decade after the film was rightfully scathed at the box-office and cascaded to an overwhelming belief that this is one of Hitch's greatest moments. It certainly is not, in fact it is one of his saddest.",Vertigo
679,pturman-929-979676,Why is this movie great?,10,19 August 2012,"SPOILER ALERT:Never seen VERTIGO? Read this review AFTER you've seen it. Seen it & love it? This review is not for you (sorry-read if you want but just know you're the choir & I'm the preacher). Think VERTIGO is maybe the most overrated movie ever? READ ON because THAT'S who this review is for! Because like you, I once thought the same thing. First let's talk about the plot holes. Like: How did Scotty get off that roof anyhow? Did they inflate a giant airbag on the street that he fell onto? Maybe a S.W.A.T. team climbed on the roof & somehow managed to tie a rope around his waist. I know: SPIDERMAN rescued him. Second: Why would Elster let an accomplice to the murder (Judy) remain behind (in the same town with the witness no less) when she could so easily expose them both? Seems a loose end Elster would not allow considering how elaborate & carefully thought out his ruse was in the first place. You can probably think of some more plot holes but those two will do for now.Another thing I hated when I first saw this movie was all the shots of Scotty following Madeline. Do we really need 30 minutes of watching her make a left turn as she leads Scotty to an art museum or cemetery or flower shop? Zzzzzzzzzzz. And how myopic would she have to be not to notice him following her (Oops. Guess that last sentence should've been in the previous paragraph)?But then a strange thing happened. Over the course of the next few years I watched this movie a 2nd time. Then a 3rd. And a 4th. And slowly I started to feel myself pleasantly being sucked into this movie-it's swirling, inexorable, gravitational pull on me similar to that on the main character. Because that's why those long scenes of Scotty following her are there: Madeline is pulling him down into a whirlpool of obsession that he will soon not be able to escape from. Notice that in just about all the shots in which he's following her, she's leading him down and to the left. In a circular motion. And even in the Church he walks through to get to the cemetery, notice the music: repeating back on its self (like a circle) & always descending. (ASIDE: Three times Scotty follows Madeline up instead of down. All three times he loses her—two times up the mission tower & one time up to the hotel room she's renting. It's true he follows Judy up to her room but that's the one time he & we don't know she's Madeline.)And speaking of the music, I personally think that's maybe the most seductive element in this movie. In fact, the score is so gloriously & emotionally evocative, Bernard Hermann deserves as much authorship of VERTIGO as Hitchcock himself in my mind. Because in the same way that we learn to love a song only after listening to it several times, this movie rewards multiple viewings.There's no evidence to suggest that Hitchcock thought of this movie as being more important or more personal than any other movie (at least from anything I've read or seen on the subject) but it would be easy to make that leap. Because as has been pointed out by Brian De Palma (who made not one, not two, but THREE movies heavily influenced by VERTIGO: OBSESSION, BODY DOUBLE, & FEMME FATALE) and others is that this movie captures a director's relationship with his leading lady (more specifically: Hitchcock's relationships with all his blonde goddesses).Scotty falls in love with Madeline, a woman who doesn't really exist. Directors fall in love with (i.e. decide to hire) a leading lady who doesn't really exist. They watch an actress playing a part in a movie & decide that actress would be perfect for their movie. Turns out Madeline is really just plain, ordinary Judy. Turns out the leading lady the director hired is just a human being-not the glamorous, bigger-than-life, 40-foot goddess he saw up their on the silver screen in her previous movie. Scotty then tries to turn Judy back into Madeline. The director-through make-up, costumes, cinematography-tries to turn his leading lady back into the gorgeous, bigger-than-life goddess he initially saw & fell in love with. Perhaps this is the metaphor Hitchcock was trying to express. Who can say? But what we can say for sure is that VERTIGO was just voted the greatest movie ever made by the most credible entity that conducts such polls: SIGHT AND SOUND. Why? Again, who can say? But my own personal opinion is that what VERTIGO is really about has to do with why we love movies: our love of and obsession with illusion.",Vertigo

Telling the story of an obsessed ex-cop (Stewart), Hitchcock weaves a tangled web of suspense, inner conflict, and the supernatural. Of all Hitchcock's films, this one is said to be the most personal, as it regards Hitch's fascination with women and the traits of actresses. Bernard Herrman's score is one of his bests.  Incorporating a dizzying series of notes in the string section- musically achieving the effect of vertigo.  Later, Herrman brings out his lush, romantic melodies, with beautiful tones, but always with an underlying harmony of doom. Perhaps featuring one of the best scenes in all of film history-Hitch lets his brilliance of camera work, knowledge of Herrman's musical abilities, and the actor's/actress's skill, capture us in a moment in time never to be forgotten.

To be specific, the cinematography is absolutely not as beautiful as today, and the edit is now like today's style — fast-pacing. So many times I chose to watch some ordinary ones in current age instead of some classic ones in old days. But that's so wrong! As time goes by and technology develops, what's left for the next generation would always be the best. Those average- quality ones would simply be replaced by the best. So for now, most of the movies would be regarded as trash maybe in hundreds of years later. Then why waste time watching them if I'm not enjoying them?So, only look for those movies which can make you enjoy - the fantastic story the movie tells - the way the director represents the story - the work of editor and cinematographer that makes it an art - the great performance of those actor and actressBack to this movie, the reasons I love it stated below. Its dialogue is designed so natural. I don't know whether it is just the style they talked in 50's or not. For me, overall, it looks natural. And the other thing is they keep connecting to the next topic they wanna talk about or the next plot that's gonna happen. And it is so fluent.Actress is so beautiful. I've always heard that in Hitchcock's movies, actress would always be beautiful blonds. Haven't got a chance to see that. We'll see.The editing and filming is actually far better than I expected, since you know it's a 1958 movie..In a word, it is so great! And now I get to understand why people would talk about Hitchcock's movies a lot and regard him as one of the greatest directors in film history.",Vertigo
683,jamescgallagher,Not the greatest film ever made... but it's close,10,19 November 2012,"Is Hitchcock's 'Vertigo' the greatest film ever made? According to the most recent BFI Sight & Sound Poll, this is most definitely the case. Generally, I have little time for polls like this. They're normally voted on by people who are too pretentious to admit that their favourite film isn't really 'Vertigo' or 'Citizen Kane' at all but is actually something much more mainstream like 'Die Hard'. Nevertheless, this is the most comprehensive poll we've got and, in its defence, it's a pretty decent one. Whilst I wouldn't necessarily agree with their assertion that 'Vertigo' is the greatest film ever made, I'd be hard pressed to find any more than a dozen films that rival it.The problem for me, however, is that I don't actually think 'Vertigo' is Hitchcock's greatest film, let alone the greatest film ever made. That's not to say it isn't one of the most accomplished and marvellous pieces of cinema I've ever seen, and it is of course a testament to one of the World's greatest ever directors that a film of this calibre isn't actually his greatest achievement, but if you're a Hitchcock-virgin (he'd love that) or you've only ever seen 'Psycho', let me use this opportunity to implore you to get watching the majority of his filmography straight away. And, if you've never seen 'Vertigo', then based on the results of the Sight & Sound Poll it's probably the best place for you to start.At its most basic, 'Vertigo' is a tense and compelling mystery with a resolution that is so simple and, in many ways, so obvious, it's a real testament to Hitchcock's genius that you never catch on until it's spelt out for you. Red herrings jump up at you from all angles and keep you hooked from start to finish, always knocking you off the scent in the most subtle of ways. Ultimately, the only logical explanation for what is going on is exactly the one that Hitchcock tricks you into avoiding. If you're watching it for the first time, the mystery should be more than enough to satisfy you. However, 'Vertigo' is multi-layered and fascinating and thoroughly engrossing on many other levels too. For one, it is a wonderful deconstruction of a man dealing with loss, grief and the aftermath of trauma. James Stewart plays the role of Scottie with all his usual charm, brilliantly portraying every facet of this wonderful and complex character's personality. The manner in which he adapts his performance throughout is so skillful and impressive that it's impossible to imagine anyone else in the role. On another level, it is a film about love and the all-consuming power it can have over people. The mystery often plays second fiddle to the intensity of the relationship between Scottie and Madeleine and, later, between Scottie and Judy. Kim Novak is, as one would only expect, dazzling in her role and alongside Stewart, the characters are utterly captivating.It is Hitchcock's marvellous direction that truly makes the film the absolute classic that it is. His signature camera-work and visual tricks are all used to great effect. Consider, for a moment, that majestic, overhead shot of the Church following Madeleine's apparent jump, or that spellbinding shot from beneath the Golden Gate Bridge that stretches out into the distance, almost like it will never end, both of which give the film a wondrous, dreamlike quality that is all but unrivalled in contemporary cinema. Speaking of which, the dream sequence following the court case is one of the most beautiful and daunting things I have ever seen. Hitchcock was always a master at manipulating colour and imagery to induce any and every emotion that he saw fit in his audience. That particular sequence, however, takes it to a whole new level. For its time, it would have been startling and completely innovative (one can't help but get the feeling that Kubrick borrowed rather heavily from it in the latter part of '2001: A Space Odyssey') and looking back on it now, it's still an incredibly powerful visual piece.This is a film in which colours speak a thousand words, a film in which every shot can be pored over for detail and a film in which every line can have multiple meanings. It is obvious that Hitchcock has devoted so much care and attention to this film that it is only right that it is praised as much as it is. Everything comes together – intense performances, stunning imagery and a soundtrack by Bernard Herrmann that is so assertive and gripping that the film can go for minutes-on-end without a single word being spoken and still tell you everything you need to know – to result in a truly thrilling conclusion. As all of the pieces fall into place, and everything becomes clear, Hitchcock drags you on that little bit further and relentlessly cranks the tension up until the credits start to roll and leaves in place a series of emotions that will remain long after they've finished.This is filmmaking at its finest. It's beautiful, it's mesmerising and it's utterly absorbing. It might not be the greatest film ever made but, in a number of ways, it's probably about as close as you're ever going to get.",Vertigo
684,make_my_day1312,Really good but the greatest?,7,1 January 2017,"So this is what some critics think is the best film of all time? Yes it was good but is it that great? That's the problem when a film is over-hyped. It's hard to live up to the reputation. Although it is dazzling to look at, especially the famous effect shot that everyone talks about, it seemed to drag in the middle. That said, I did really like it even if it felt too long. I think if it was made today, they'd shorten the script by about 30 minutes. Maybe I just have a short attention span. Despite my concerns, I still give the film a solid 7 out of 10 but have certainly enjoyed other Alfred Hitchcock films a lot more.",Vertigo
685,TerpStudent,It Would Have Been Perfect If Not For a Few Crippling Flaws,9,1 January 2013,"This was a top-notch film-noir set against the luscious backdrop of 1950 San Francisco, and it would have been a perfect work by Hitchcock if not for a few crippling flaws. I understand that this is a daring and controversial thing to say, but James Stewart was horribly miscast in this movie; the role of Scottie required no major talent and the movie would have been exactly the same with any other competent actor in his place.Though the incomparable Jimmy Stewart is a fine actor, he was also too old to be Kim Novak's love interest. Because of the age difference between the two leads, and because his affection for her began from afar, his feelings for her are more like displaced emotions from his obsession with trying to save her rather than a romance. His obsession only escalates when he meets Judith and his attempt to transform her into an allusion is demeaning and unhealthy which makes him an unlikable character throughout the third act.But because of the perfection in all other areas of acting, script, suspense, set design, and the riveting, unpredictable surprises, the film is still an immortal classic, not to be missed by anyone.",Vertigo
686,Punisher-8,"Hitchcock at his best! Don't read this comment, just go watch it!",10,2 August 2004,"Blistering! Amazing! Shocking! Only a true master could make a movie like this. Hitchcock knows exactly where he's going and plays you like a cat playing a mouse. he will drag you in, and never let go. Even long after the movie is finished!A lot of people think of movies like ""Birds"" and ""Psycho"" when they think of Hitchcock. Forget those! Watch THIS one!James Stewart is excellent, as always. I had never heard of Kim Novak, and looking at her appearance list i wasn't sure what to expect (well actually i expected a bad acting bimbo). But she was more than great!I never felt so ..... after seeing this movie. It wasn't happy, it wasn't sad, and i was unsure of the ending (but it was certainly suspenseful).

687,rabidrobertfan,"This Movie was Disappointing at First-Now, I Love It!",10,24 March 2014,"It's the movie that perfectly describes its name-Vertigo, the film often considered to be Hitchcock's masterpiece. The experience I had with this movie the first time I saw it was, pun-intended, vertigo-inducing. Vertigo was only the second Hitchcock film I saw and I wish somebody had warned me of what I was to expect. At the end, the first thing I said was ""holy crap."" If asked point-blank, I couldn't have been able to tell you whether I liked it or not because there were elements I liked and elements I didn't like but overall, it was an overwhelming experience and it may hold the record for the only movie I was ever afraid of. The plot is so tortuous, one really needs to view it multiple times to completely get the gist of it and become ""immune"" to it. A detective named Scottie Ferguson with a paralyzing fear of heights quits the San Francisco police force and then is hired by an old college buddy to follow the latter's wife, who has been displaying strange psychological behavior. Scottie becomes increasingly and dangerously obsessed with the cool blonde and ends up being driven to the brink of insanity. There are several things I love about this movie since as of this writing, I've seen it a total of five times. First and foremost, the acting is top-notch but then again, Hitchcock did get a top-notch actor in the always lovable Jimmy Stewart-well, he's actually not quite that lovable in Vertigo. Gone are the days of his ""aw-shucks"" persona in It's a Wonderful Life, Mr. Smith Goes to Washington and Rear Window. Stewart's performance in Vertigo is so complex and convincing, it disturbs me a bit-and it's a heck of a performance. In the beginning, he still retains a little of his old likable mannerisms but as the films progresses, he becomes darker and more agitated so that by the climax, his anger boils over to the point of him yelling at Kim Novak's character and throughout, his eyes have a crazed and tortured shine that I've never seen in any other film of his-and I've seen over twenty films of his. He completely pulls off the role of a necrophiliac sufferer of Freud's Repetition Complex and his habit of following Kim Novak-and later leering at women who bear a resemblance to her- are more than borderline stalker. This is really the only one of Jimmy Stewart's characters I don't like and if he can make me not like him, then I really must have some great evidence to support my statement of him being the greatest actor ever. But let's not forget Kim Novak's performance. She plays dual roles-which is really tough to pull off- and does it flawlessly. Anyone else in her role just would not have worked. Novak adds a certain haunting and hypnotic quality to the character of Madeleine that adds to her mystery and elusiveness. Also, I love the photography in this film-it's probably some of the most beautiful photography I've ever seen in a film period. There is a dreamlike quality and the pastel tone of the colors reminds me of a watercolor painting. Heck, it's so beautiful, it makes me want to go to San Francisco. The music is brilliant as well and almost makes you see swirling patterns. I think that Hitchcock truly captured lightning in a bottle with this movie and that there will never be another film like it. If I had to say anything against it, it would be just a personal thing. The nightmare sequence will probably always creep me out no matter how many times I see the movie. This movie is brilliant.",Vertigo
688,juanmendoza333,Hitchcock Gold,10,24 August 2014,"If I had one word to describe this film, that word would be style. Serious style. Whatever tone or mood that Hitchcock is presenting to us during this film is executed in a memorable way. From suspense, to romance, to intrigue. For example, one of the things that Hitchcock knew how to do great was to tastefully showcase the beauty of a woman as opposed to letting her simply be sexual eye candy. (To put it into modern context: girls in modern blockbusters come across the same as any girl next to a car in a magazine. whereas in a Hitchcock film they feel more like they stem from a painting). But Hitchcock does that in all his films, and this one has a lot more going for it than just showcasing a beautiful woman. The most memorable trait of this film for me is that it borders on two tones, a Romance and a Ghost Story, the mix of the two tones is what gives it an off but intriguing tone, and even aids in the pace of the film. For you see at times this film feels like a mix of the two, then suddenly something will trigger one of the tones to stand out, and then back to the other. The best thing being is that neither compromises the other; when it feels like a romance it doesn't feel cheap it feels truly emotional. And when it wants to make you feel uncomfortable in the horror fashion it feels intense; psycho/rear window level intense. These two tones are what defines Vertigo for me; its an unusual but fascinating experience.My personal favorite Hitchcock film.",Vertigo
689,philpho,Patchwork of DSM1 disorders to a Serenade of Strings,8,22 October 2013,"Its hard to extract the movie medium as story-teller from a linear progression of logic. Failing to do so can be art but more likely bad film-making. In Vertigo (1958) the seams are well and truly showing. I appreciate unpredictable twists and turns drives interest but this presages Cary Grant's drunken drive in the upcoming North by Northwest.It's 1956-7 and someone behind a typewriter has a list of psychiatric conditions and is plot-lining these. Reminding ourselves that the first Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders appeared in 1952, its hard not to see the script team thumbing dog-eared versions for more character characteristics. I'm getting used to Mr Hitchcock's script-progressing irritating irrationality, getting the plot into peril and then extracting us from it. So often he makes us take Fergusonian leaps of faith which similarly has us clutching the gutters of credibility. Clearing the kids from the school in The Birds to name but one or the crop duster pilot not seeing the truck. These abound. The price of a classic scene. Perhaps the gutter is a metaphor the script itself, or even Hitch's hold on the film-making process. Like the ending. Where else could it, and she, possibly go apart from another 1958 industry standard bar? Mr Hitchcock went for the box. According to IMDb it grossed over half the production cost in the opening weekend so that's the formula there. Lots of magic moments embedded in a crisis of how to link them together, credibly. At least with the Road-Runner, you get a new story each time. But that's the man. The music score though benign, is the most disturbing. The syntax of the strings is aged and hackneyed (surprising for a man born not far away in Leytonstone and at the peak of his career) - a parody of the style? I doubt it. What progress in a couple of years towards the 'shower strings' in Psycho. Imaging what re-scoring this film could do.Back to DSM1. Centrally, Ferguson's frankly sexually obsessive stalking behaviour is crudely over-portrayed and uncomfortable. One wonders if JS was the person for this role. Robert Mitchum springs to mind but Brando plus or minus shirt would have done it better. Were the chaotic emotions and behaviour in the principles a crafted representation, or just very bad application of 'disorder' into standard scripting? Mr Elster must have had a copy too : 'Mrs Elster' appears to be having seizures, later fully entering an apparent dissociative fugue. I say apparent as it turns out (spoiler) it was a script driven put-on. Not bad for a shipbuilding murdering millionaire(script cred logical error). Moving 'forwards', 'Doctor' validates his sanguine Victorian diagnosis of Ferguson as 'melancholia' with evident psycho-analytic tendencies. Perhaps the punters indicated they needed more info. Two years later, in Psycho, we get a comprehensive profile of Bates' condition lacking only a Christopher Waltz accent. Fear of Germs - the transmission of psychiatric disorders through shared body fluids is put to the audience, after Stewart and Novak have a suitably strung moment of mouth passion, after which he starts having her dreams. Um. Product placement moment. Ferguson also has a spell of dissociation where he briefly becomes a Jimmy Stewart character from another movie. Most likely the script team were having a go at Post Traumatic Stress Disorder after the first incident in the film. This movie has many good points like the moody dusk and dawn shots. As Jimmy cruises the streets of SF after the big green Bentley (sorry, Jag) I had a massive Bullitt replay of tyre shredding acceleration. One of those 'oh that's where it came from' moments, like men whining after a woman called 'Livia' in Italian. The brown suit sits well on the bland career cop we first meet too far up the ladder yet not far enough up to avoid chasing Liberace lookalikes a couple of pants behind an older and fitter but myopic beat cop. Oh they were probably warning shots advising him not to attempt the next leap of faith across 42nd Street onto a 45degree pitched roof. The fools.And so to the fear of heights. This left a whole generation of folk thinking that is Vertigo. Despite the handy medical lesson on the flashback set of Rear Widow where we learn this phobia is acrophobia. Followed by a well-acted demonstration of Vertigo : provoking spinney sensations via head movement (atop the Croc Dundee 'steps – call that a step?' ). The connection is? Ah, the medical dictionary again. Alarmingly, this demo causes Jimmy to fall (safely - release of tension there for sure) into the string strung safe arms of homely Midge. Any half decent OH&S'er would have known from the brown shoes taking the last step that this was yet further risky behaviour from Mr Brown, which to use the parlance, reflects his underlying relationship needs.As always the gorgeous wardrobe of the lead lady is fabulously hung. The player / character age thing takes another bow as 1908 JS pursues 1933 KN in mummy's platinum grey. They look like classmates. Her makeover had me fully taken in. Back on the brink: So the title if the film could have been any medical condition. It does suggest disorientation, discomfort and perhaps a touch of nausea. Well chosen then.I appreciate there are many fans but Ill leave Mr Lynch as the master of creep at the emotional level and keep watching Hitch's undoubted massive cinematographic legacy.Thanks for reading.",Vertigo
690,matt_clarke1981,A great suspenseful film,9,28 March 2005,"Having seen Psycho I thought I had seen Hitchcock's best film. This film compares favourably. Vertigo has a great cast, Jimmy Stewart, and Kim Novak. Set in San Francisco with beautiful scenery, a plot unravels where you will be drawn in, and hooked to the conclusion. This is a suspenseful film from beginning to end.This is beautifully filmed, from the camera work, to the use of colour, and the film score adds greatly to the drama. This is a thrilling and clever film. The characters are whole and interesting, and Stewarts performance is compelling, and really marks him as one of the great actors. Kim Novak puts in a performance that is one of the best leads I've seen by a female actress.All round this is a wonderful, delightful film, with a in depth look at the human psyche, that has a strong resonance.Doesn't get a 10 because, i'm a film buff and very stingy.",Vertigo
691,kathleen-n-oneal,A Great Classic Thriller That Works on Many Levels,8,1 December 2014,"Vertigo is many things - a meditation on the illusions engendered by romantic attraction, an original and engrossing psychological thriller, a story about how people cope with trauma and psychological problems in ways that can ultimately prove self-defeating, a film about how people deceive each other, and a look at the ways that men and women lie to each other in the context of heterosexual relationships. Not only is the plot engrossing and the story told one that touches on many interesting and important themes, but the motifs employed throughout the film (the hairstyle employed by the woman in the picture in the art gallery and in other places throughout the film, the necklace, paintings, the old church building, the nuns, the grave, and agoraphobia and vertigo themselves as phenomenological experiences and psychiatric conditions) are nuanced, expertly deployed, and lend themselves to an even deeper analysis than the one provided here. I also found the contrast between John's ex-fiancé and the other woman he falls in love with to be an important contrast in the film as well. The score is amazing and the way that the sound and visual elements work together make it very clear why people say that Alfred Hitchcock was the master of suspense.",Vertigo
692,dazzyfresh,The biggest mystery is how did this film become so highly rated?,3,1 September 2011,"I am a big fan of Hitchcock but how this hits the high ratings is a bigger mystery than the film itself. The first 20 minutes or so give's you an indication that its going to be another classic. Sadly, like me you will be wrong.If you are looking to watch your first Hitchcock film to see what all the fuss is about then don't watch this. The directing of the film isn't I suppose the problem but the story has the excitement factor of a roller coaster climbing slowly slowly for over an hour, levelling out for 20 minute's before hitting a few promising bumps which will then lead you to being chucked off with nothing more than whiplash from your chin hitting your chest as you continuously nod off.Without going into detail or being a spoiler, this film laboriously drags out with a retired detective (James Stuart) being paid to follow his friend's wife(Kim Novak)employed by the friend himself as he has concerns for his wife's mental stability due to strange reasons. All the obvious things happen boy/detective meets girls sort of stuff and you will begin to build your theory of what's going to happen which may or may not be correct, but you wont care either way as disappointment will set in long before the end. If you do manage to stay awake to catch the ending be prepared to shake your head, re-write it your self and wonder why you didn't listen to me and save your self a few hours in the first place. I suppose their is a twist which you would expect, but theirs not enough depth to the mystery to make it worthwhile.I advice if you intend to watch this film from start to finish indulge with ample amounts of caffeine and be prepared to shut out the whiny music that begins to annoy.In my opinion not one of his finest hours as you may of gathered, nor a must see film. I do hope people don't give films good ratings for the Hitchcock factor as a film should be rated on more than its branded logo.

Why do people continually bow down to something just because it's ""the definitive classic?""  Why did they leave the unnecessary 30-45 minutes in there?  Why was this film so horrendously acted, directed, filmed, and edited?Where to go on... Ah yes.  The plot:The plot was a wonderful concept.  A nice couple of twists, the story set up well and ready to hand off for a touchdown, but somewhere along the way, the runningback decided he should run a few laps around the field, in randomly alternating directions, before finally meandering in and taking a knee at the one-yard line and settle for a field goal.The acting:  Stiff, over-done, ""no-sir-audience-i'm-not-reading-my-lines-from-cue-cards"" crap.  James Stewart was quite possibly the worst choice.  He only has one speed: ""Merry Christmas Bell Tower!""  Every movie I've seen him in he's been the same idiotic dimwit.  His intended affable, lovable goofy exterior only irritates, frustrates and makes you want to set fire to the videotape or DVD it sullies.  Kim Novak was hardly any better.  Her cookie cutter character, ""I-dare-you-not-to-love-me-NOWAIT-I'm-untouchable-NOWAIT-help-me-NOWAIT-i'm -insane"" would have been served up more convincingly by James Stewart himself in a dress.  At least he has a whopping two modes to his emoting.Editing and Directing:  Why did Midge exist?  She provided no conflict save for that weird thing she did with the painting.  She provided no resolution. She didn't even serve as a voice of any particular sway (i.e. the viewer, the voice of reason, the voice of emotion etc).  An amazingly sexist viewpoint (I know, surprise, it was the 50's) pervades.  The women are stupid, naive, weak-willed and two-dimensional.  There were so many unnecessary camera shots, such as nearly all the various scenes during the ""I'm-following-Madeline-with-my-intense-stare-of-concern-and-intrigue"" car sequences.Quite frankly, I'm so disgusted with this movie, I can't really go on with any intelligent critiquing.  I wish I could say that we've grown as an industry and learned our lesson about contrived, pointless plots with big names displaying less than tolerable acting capabilities, but only a fool would ignore Pearl Harbor.Maybe we can salvage the concept.

This film was made before I was born but it's appeal is timeless enough to make it one of my top ten favorite movies.Kim Novak openly challenges Grace Kelly in the glamor stakes. Her facial expressions are riveting and clearly meet Hitch's requirement to make cinema audiences squirm uncomfortably in their seats. She is everything 50's woman was and should be. Jimmy Stewart shows why he was justifiably the icon of an age. For me, Hitch was always able to get more from Jimmy Stewart than other directors. Looking at Rear Window and The Man Who Knew Too Much, Jimmy Stewart turns in a much better performance than in the countless westerns I've seen.Hitchcock has always messed with my head. Hitch led the way and other directors followed. There is a particular camera sequence in Vertigo when Madeleine (Kim Novak) runs up a spiral staircase and Scotty (Jimmy Stewart) follows. Special effects were somewhat limited in the 50's compared to today so Hitch used the spiral staircase and camera focus to convey the dizziness Scotty was feeling. Simple but effective. So effective in fact I've seen Spielberg use exactly this camera effect in one of his movies. Almost 50 years on and this work is still fresh.The script is well written and the atmosphere between Novak and Stewart can be cut with a knife. Everything tells the story - the script, the set, the costume and the physical interaction of the leads. There is an intense repressed passion about this movie. The cast sit on an emotional volcano that seems to be constantly on the verge of erupting.The classic Hitch-twist is a real surprise. Everything in your head tells you this could never be and Hitch takes you straight in that direction. There is a strange sense of voyeurism about the second part of this movie. It feels like you are seeing something that you really should not see. You are going into that small forbidden place that everyone keeps to themselves. That part that even husband and wife don't share. As a viewer that certainly makes me squirm uncomfortably in my seat, so I think Mr Hitchcock has achieved his objective.As a movie there are pieces that date and make it very obviously a 50's movie. However, the most important part, the plot the script and the relationship between the two protagonists - dress them in fashions for the 21st century and you could re-shoot this film today.What makes this movie so very special is the emotional roller-coaster ride Mr Hitchcock takes you on. The out-of-control speed and the wheels coming off at every turn and as you look to your left you see Hitch has turned into a squealing demon delighting in every second of your discomfort. You'll feel like you've run a marathon. This movie is ""exhausting"".",Vertigo
701,Desslar,Somewhat disappointing,7,10 March 2002,"Contains spoilers:Having recently seen and enjoyed Psycho for the first time, I had high hopes for this one.  While beautifully shot and generally entertaining, there were a number of plot points that were simply too far-fetched.  First, the ridiculous scheme to cover up the wife's murder.  Surely there was a much more convenient way to discreetly knock her off (cut brake line?) than a weaving a silly ghost story.  Next, Scottie falls in love and starts putting the moves on his friend's wife within a couple days of meeting her.  That hardly seems very Jimmy Stewart-esque.  Finally, the incomprehensible ending.  Why does Judy jump?  There is no evidence given that she's suicidal, although she can't be happy with the turn her relationship has just taken.  The sight of a nun approaching can hardly be spooky enough for her to desire to plunge to her death.  And Scottie doesn't even seem terribly shaken up about the whole business this time around.  Overall good, but strangely unsatisfying.7/10, because it is Hitchcock after all and Stewart is always great.",Vertigo
702,LenoJeno,Hitchcock's Masterpice,10,22 January 2021,"This movie simply becomes increasingly greater over time, as can be seen in the Sight and Sound critics poll, where its rank increased over the decades until it topped the poll - an achievment that only two other movies ever could do: Bycicle Thieves and Citizen Kane.After a second time viewing, it is easy to see why. Hitchcock visually describes the different feelings and motivations of the characters so perfectly, so that it is difficult not to understand what the characters are thinking in a scene.This can be seen late in the movie when Scottie and Judy are having dinner at Ernies. In the background, one can see a slightly blurry image of a blond in a grey suit - this combined with the red background reminds the viewer on the first time Scottie met Madeline. Since this is shown in a subjective shot of Scottie, we know exactly what he is thinking: I wish Judy were Madeline. Judy realizes that he is looking behind her and also spots the woman. We can see how she is disapointed. And we know why: She pretended to be Madeline, so we know that she knows what scottie is thinking. This scene is completely told without dialouge, only visuals.Another amazing moment in the film is when Judy has her flashback just after Scottie met her for the first time. Just before the flashback, she looks dead-straight into the camera. The director therefore visually demonstrates that she wants to confess something to the audience.Scottie's famous dream sequence is great to watch out of context, but absolutely haunting if you watched the movie up to then.The creative use of color, framing and camera angles make for an overall amazing expirience; a movie that every film lover has to watch sometime thoughout his life!",Vertigo

With all of the leading up with the sub-plot of the ""Ghost"" I was certain at the end when they returned to the top of the tower and we see a ""Ghost Like"" image slowly appear just before Novak falls, we would have seen Bel Geddes character appear to really be the ""Ghost"" and in a fit of rage push Novak to her death. Her own obsession with the Ghost story and with Scottie would have taken her over the edge and wanting to be rid of Novak. I still don't get when Scottie followed Novak to the Old Inn and sees her in the upstairs window only to be told by the Innkeeper that sometimes she indeed does stop by once or twice a week she was not there that day and confirms it by showing him the room which was indeed vacant, I just didn't get this at all.

709,frog_16,Dark side of romantic love,10,11 August 2010,"***SPOILERS BELOW***What I find striking about this film is how it presents such a pessimistic view of romantic love. James Stewart (as Scotty) starts out playing one of his average-guy hero characters, who falls into depression and then into a troubling obsession because of his misplaced romantic love. Most films seem to glorify romance & love. Hitchcock seems to have wanted to point out that though this emotion can be at the center of our lives it is often based upon superficialities. Many films present love as something that is destine to happen between two people. I think that Hitchcock was having fun with this idea, flipping it on its head and twisting it with all sorts of irony... e.g. The person who Scotty fell so deeply in love with did not really exist, she was simply an 'act' (i.e. It's Judy pretending to be Madeleine, who were two very different types of women).Scotty fell completely for the con-job that was Judy pretending to be Madeleine. Then to complicate things Judy in turn also falls in love with him. As part of a murder scheme, Scotty is led to believe 'his' Madeleine has died, in part, due to his negligence. Later when he is wandering the streets of San Francisco he stumbles upon Judy whom he thinks only looks like his lost love. He then strikes up a romantic relationship with her... But Scotty does not appear to be capable of loving Judy for who she really is. e.g. He had become morbidly obsessed with Judy's fake version of Madeleine and he pressures Judy into looking & acting like her (once again), which she does out of love for him. Because of Judy's love for Scotty she decides that her tastes, preferences and even her personality didn't really matter anymore... e.g. Judy gives-in to Scotty's desires and takes on the personality of someone very different from herself.In one sense Scotty is the archetypal romantic hero, who against all odds finds his lost love. But in another sense he is a 'sucker' and someone who has been rendered mentally unstable by his love for a woman who never really existed. Contrast this with Scotty's best friend (Midge), a fairly attractive woman who adores him. Compared to Judy, Midge seems like a woman much more suited to Scotty's tastes. But he is just too romantically fixated on Judy's 'faux' Madeleine for Midge to have a real shot at him. This movie is great for a lot of reasons, many of which have already been mentioned here in other reviews, including: 1.) Novak skillfully playing two very different personalities. 2.) The view it gives us of San Francisco circa the 1950's. 3.) The movie's plot goes through very interesting thematic changes (Starting as a supernatural love story/drama then changing mid-stream into a psychological drama heavily laden with irony.). 4.) It has a wonderful musical score. 5.) And there is a VERY dark ending to the story (Something almost unheard of in American movies prior to the mid-1960's) There are some slight glitches to this film's storyline, None of which I feel are too distracting with the possible exception of the somewhat convoluted wife-murder-scheme, which might seem too far-fetched for some people to accept. But then again, this murder scheme seems just as believable as those portrayed in many of Agatha Christie's famous stories. If I remember correctly Hitchcock said that he felt that such background details were not that important when trying to get an audience immersed into a story. Hey the story works for me! This is one of my favorite movies.",Vertigo
710,iam-774526,"It is the viewers' attachment with the film that makes ""Vertigo"" a true masterpiece...",10,26 November 2009,"Alfred Hitchcock is considered to be one of the best directors ever put footsteps on the earth. His one of most notable film ""Vertigo"" (1958) is undoubtedly a masterpiece. Many of the critics keep Vertigo at the top of their list. At the time of 1st release the movie got mixed review comments (like most of the Hitchcock movies) and never got any significant awards (naturally). Later it has been re-evaluated and unanimously loved by all. The movie is about a private detective (Scottie – played by James Stewart) who will be hired by one of his old friends to follow the friend's wife (Madeleine – played by Kim Novak). No, she is not cheating her husband. But everyday she used to take her husband's car and roams about the city randomly; but it seems she could not recall it - she don't even know about it. So Scottie's (our hero) job is to see what she does throughout the day. Hitchcock had an awesome ability to attract all sort of viewers. No one else could have been able to keep suspense throughout the film like him. It is probably because he could make the viewers to be a character of his film. In this film also we, the viewers, takes the place of Scottie when he follows her by car, keep a close eye on what she is doing. Thus Hitchcock made the viewers to become a part of ""Vertigo"". Viewers become active characters of the movie. Scottie has vertigo. If you search dictionary you will get the meaning: ""A sensation of whirling or falling"". But Salman Rushdie once told that ""Vertigo is the conflict between the fear of falling and the desire to fall"". This definition probably fits better in context of this movie. A fellow policeman of Scottie died falling from a roof while they were chasing a criminal. That policeman actually was trying to save Scottie's life. Since then Scottie had developed his acrophobia. The movie starts with that incident. After that he has been hired by his friend, he saves life of Madeleine once and in unavoidable circumstances yes, he falls in love with her. (""Falls"" in love! How appropriate is the expression in this movie!!!) I will not spoil your viewing by telling more. In the middle there is a twist. Near the end of the movie we see Scottie has overcome his vertigo. But that incident is followed by another one – very similar to the 1st scene of the movie – someone falls from the top and dies. The 1st incident creates the vertigo of Scottie; the 2nd incident is closely related with the way he has overcome his vertigo. Will the 2nd incident create another vertigo in Scottie's head? Hitchcock did not provide us the answer. The whole movie is like an endless spiral staircase. As the movie progresses we fall more and more into the spiral. We see 3 people die in the movie – all of them by falling from top. I have told that the 1st and last one is thematically very similar. So are the 2nd and last one. Scottie believes he is responsible (which he is not) for the 2nd death; so he tried to overcome that guilty feeling. That only brings in the 3rd death – this time he is the responsible person. When the movie credits are being shown camera zooms into an eye of Madeleine. After we (mind it, we – the viewers – the characters of Hitchcock's movie) enter the eye of Madeleine we see spirals of different colors. The credits roll on. And at the end of the credit camera zooms out the eye. But will Scottie be ever able to leave the spiral puzzle within his head? Can he forget Madeleine, her eyes, her blonde hair (another Hitchcockian theme), her dress, her necklace, and the way she used to decorate her hair? May be not. And so do us. If we try to uncover vertigo, the film, we will only push ourselves further into the dark dungeon. We may see a light in front of us. We may start thinking that we have uncovered vertigo. But only till we understand the light is only the beginning of another dungeon. It is the viewers' attachment with the film that makes ""Vertigo"" so fascinating, so captive, so provocative and a true masterpiece. ""Vertigo"" will also be remembered for a unique technique – ""Dolly Zoom"". In this technique ""the camera is pulled away from a subject whilst the lens zooms in, or vice-versa. Thus, during the zoom, there is a continuous perspective distortion, the most directly noticeable feature being that the background appears to change size relative to the subject"" (excerpts from Wikipedia). This technique is also known as ""Vertigo Zoom"" or ""Vertigo Effect"". Many film directors have used this technique since then. It has become quite a cliché now. And don't forget the character of Midge. She is just opposite to what Madeleine is. She is not-so-good looking, single and unfortunately in love with Scottie. She is the 1st step of the ladder which Scottie can easily climb without any problem. But Madeleine is at 3 or 4 steps up the ladder. And as the definition of vertigo goes (""the desire to fall"") Scottie wants Madeleine only. I have a theory that the 2nd part of the film is all within Scottie's head; it is in his dream; it is not real. It is only because the 2nd half starts so abruptly and Midge is surprisingly absent in the 2nd half. Another scene of the movie really captivates me. It is the scene when Scottie and Madeleine go to see the coastal redwoods at Muir Woods National Monument. There is something special about the scene which I cannot explain. Or there may be nothing like that. It is only in my mind! Probably it is the effect of vertigo! Man! I should stop thinking about the film now!!!",Vertigo
711,msifer30,Left Hanging: Vertigo as Neo-Noir,10,9 May 2003,"CAUTION: SPOILER AHEAD!!!The film noir Vertigo, (1958) directed by Alfred Hitchcock and adapted from the novel d'Entre les Morts (The Living and the Dead) by Pierre Boileau and Thomas Narcejac uses a structure that leaves the audience hanging by creating loose ends in the plot and through ellipses in the story. The story follows Det. John 'Scottie' Ferguson (James Stewart) as he is hired by an old friend Gavin Elster (Tom Helmore) to look into his wife's infatuation with a mysterious woman named Carlotta Valdez. Ferguson's acrophobia, or intense fear of heights, has caused him to retire as a detective and he now works as a freelance private detective. Without giving away the plot, it is hard to describe the structure of this film. Throughout there are plot twists which change the entire direction of the film which leave the past behind. The audience is left wondering what really happened.Even from the very beginning of the film, the audience is left hanging. It opens with Ferguson and a policeman chasing a fugitive across the rooftops of buildings in San Francisco. Ferguson falls, but hangs onto a flimsy water drain looking down six stories to the ground. The policeman with Ferguson attempts to save him, but falls to his death. It is not explained how Ferguson actually escapes his predicament, which seems unlikely. He could have pulled himself up, but the flimsy water drain would have snapped. Also, no one else was around to help him any time soon, so it becomes questionable if he could have been helped. In the next scene, Ferguson talks about wearing a corset with his friend Marjorie 'Midge' Wood (Barbra Bel Geddes). He is also using a cane. If Ferguson had fallen from the drain, he would be either dead, or have sustained a traumatic injury, so his injuries do not offer any clues as to what happened. From this point, the audience is first exposed to the element of the film which keeps them hanging, just like Ferguson on the drain.In addition to leaving the audience wondering, Vertigo utilizes its ellipsoidal structure to give an exposition to the story. The first scene of the film starts out with a past event that gives way to the present. Ferguson's incident on the rooftop gives way to a present day conversation with Wood, which allows the audience to understand why Wood is so concerned when Ferguson attempts to climb a chair. She knows that if he does his vertigo would set in for him. Through this ellipse in time, we learn of Ferguson's weakness. We see a past traumatic experience of Ferguson and then move onto the present time.The next part of the film consists of Ferguson conducting the investigation for his old friend Gavin Elster (Tom Helmore). Elster wants to find out why his wife, Madeleine Elster (Kim Novak) is seemingly possessed by a mysterious dead woman named Carlotta Valdez. In her dreamlike state, she continuously attempts suicide, trying to rid the spirit of Valdez from her body. At one point, she falls in the San Francisco bay and Ferguson pulls her out. They begin to fall in love, but Elster's condition seems to get worse and worse. She actually thinks she is Valdez. Then, on a trip to the Mission San Juan Bautista, Elster falls from the tower. Ferguson is blamed for her death, as he was stricken with vertigo attempting to climb the stairs to save her.This is when the film becomes a uniquely structured film. In typical film noir and murder mysteries, there is a final conclusion which gives all the solutions to the mystery. But in Vertigo the twist occurs in the middle of the film, exposing Ferguson's friend Gavin Elster's plan to murder his wife. Ferguson soon finds out that the Madeleine Elster he met earlier is a decoy, actually a department store clerk named Judy Barton. As the audience discovers later, the real Madeleine Elster took a dive off the mission tower. The timing of this revelation disorients the audience. Accustomed to an explanatory conclusion, they may become uncomfortable, as it is what creates tension in the film. The anticipation of the all explanatory conclusion makes for entertainment. Now the focus of the film shifts from the murder to Ferguson, who seemingly has lost his mind in despair for his deceased lover. As he falls deeper into a spiral of despair, Ferguson becomes the confusing character.
While the film follows Ferguson, his motivations and intentions are confusing. At one point, he wants Barton to dress up exactly like Elster. His infatuation with detail makes it unclear if he is in love with Barton, or if he cannot get over the death of the woman he thought he knew. But, the audience does not know if Ferguson knows that Barton is the imposter, so it seems as though his actions are the desperate attempts to resuscitate his lost love. Maybe Ferguson is interested only in the physical appearance of Barton dressed up like Elster, not her real personality. This raises questions, because when he succeeds in making Barton up like the decoy she played earlier, this fantasy realized does not satisfy him. Maybe this is because Ferguson already knows that she is manipulating him yet again. Although Barton shows sympathy for him, she seems to feed off his money and care. All the while, she is hiding the true story behind the murder, which is malicious as it is. By not telling him, she is building up the damage that would be done if Ferguson were to find out the truth. There is no reason why someone in love would subject their lover to the torment of lost love. Even if Barton knew that this revelation would break Ferguson, she should have alerted him to this information.
Barton's motivations become acceptable after Ferguson reads her letter, which creates a flashback showing the circumstances under which she was placed at the time of the murder. It seems as though she did not know that the real Elster would be murdered. At this point in the film, Ferguson is in the position to decide his fate. As a fervent detective, he would destroy his integrity by forgetting Barton was involved, or break the law by not exposing the murder. In the climax of the film as Ferguson and Barton argue and struggle at the top of the tower at the Mission San Juan Bautista, Barton falls to her death. Compared to other endings in film noir, this one is similar in the way that it leaves room for ambiguity. The entire supernatural theme present in the earlier part of the film is left hanging. The true character of Ferguson is also left in question, because his choice is left to chance. A difference between this ending and other noir endings is that it offers a balanced fate for both characters. While Ferguson loses both of his love interests, Barton dies for helping murder another woman. They both get what was coming to them.
But the audience is left hanging as the ending does not tie in the loose ends of the film, such as the supernatural element, the fate of Gavin Elster (who should have been punished himself), and why Ferguson decided to bring Barton to the mission tower in first place. This ambiguity is what characterizes this film structurally as noir. The spiral motif embodied by Ferguson's vertigo (made with rack focus), and the stairs leading to the top of the mission tower. The end of the film seems to spiral off into chance, as it does not answer many of the audience's questions.",Vertigo
712,claude-alexander,Disappointing and corny,6,23 May 2009,"How this film got into the top 250 films on here remains beyond believe to me and I simply don't understand all the fuss about it.I have nothing against slow paced films, some films need it to make you think (Tarkovsky's ""Stalker"" for instance), but here it is it's downfall as one has by far enough time to realise everything that doesn't make any sense at all. I'll give a few examples.When Scottie (James Stewart) follows Madeleine Elster (Kim Novak) through San Francisco you can't help but wonder why on earth she doesn't realise it and how on earth a former police officer is so poor at doing it. He's following her so closely you'd expect him to crash into her car any time. This is highlighted when she turns into that small backstreet to get the flowers. There is no-one else, but still he parks his car a few metres from her's and still she doesn't get suspicious. This must also be the only film set in San Francisco that manages to show no streetcar at all.Scottie has a friend who seems to love him in Midge (Barbara Bel Geddes, she probably gives the best performance in this film), but it remains beyond my imagination why he doesn't fall in love with her but the artificial looking Madeleine. This guy is making life difficult for himself and during the entire film I started disliking this character more and more. Sadly Midge disappears about half way through this film.Then, when Scottie meets Judy in the street and he starts making her life a mess one wonders why she doesn't simply tell him the truth. She doesn't seem to be that stupid, but fails to realise that this may well stop him from trying to turn her back into Madeleine. During that part of the film I also started hoping for Scottie to die at the end of the film as he got so obsessed and rude with Judy that it angered me. Unfortunately this didn't happen, but Judy got so scared by a nun that she virtually jumped of that tower. Comically, really.If this would have been the first Hitchcock film I had ever watched, then it would have been the last, too. Some of the acting is pretty lame and unconvincing, especially from Stewart, but Novak surely could have done better in a few scenes, too. Bel Geddes is good, though. In general the story/plot isn't bad at all, but the translation into a film leaves a lot to desire. During the entire film I have had ideas of how the scenes could have been shot more believable and I am as far from a director as it gets. The pace of the film is, as I have stated before, too slow for the story. Stewart seems to be behind the wheel most of the time, following Madeleine in her aimless journeys. All in all I found this film extremely cheesy. The music overly exaggerated many scenes and made things kind of predictable. Some of the shots are nice, though, but it is an absolutely pointless film. I won't ever watch this again and suggest you don't either.Rating this waste of time 6/10 is me being generous.",Vertigo
713,k_d_f_l,The Best Movie Ever!!!,10,1 January 2005,"This is the best movie ever, with more depth than I have ever seen. In 2003, I flew from New York to San Francisco just to see the sights in the movie.Scottie's (Jimmy Stewart's) apartment is located at 900 Lombard Street (corner of Jones), one block downhill from the famous crooked street. The door is no longer red, but the doorbell and mailbox are still in the same place. The bushes have definitely grown! Seeing this apartment gave me chills. You would recognize it even if you didn't have the address.Coit Tower can be seen from the apartment as in the movie.Madeline's (Kim Novak's) apartment is located at 1000 Mason Street. It looks the same.The Misson San Juan Bautista is 100 miles south of San Francisco. It was creepy. There is not a bell tower there. The eucalyptus trees that Scotty and Madeline drove through (the divided highway) to get there is actually a few minutes south of San Juan Bautista. Therefore, they would not have passed through that area on their way from San Francisco to San Juan Bautista.A person at Mission Deloris showed me where the headstone was located in the movie. It was eerie.I had a picture of me taken at the Palace of the Legion of Honor, sitting on the bench where Kim Novak sat. Also, they have a great Vertigo scrapbook for visitors to look at.Scotty and Judy walked outside of the Palace of Fine Arts. It looked the same.Muir Woods looked the exact same. The sign that Madeline pointed to and said ""This is when I was born. This is when I died"" is there.

Incidentally, this was the first time I'd seen her in films, when I saw this for the first time in 1988. That was the first of countless times I have seen it.

Just take it as someone's dream (or nightmare). If you're after an action movie or that sort of thing, it might be best to let that mood pass before watching Vertigo.Highlights for me: the Saul Bass credits, the opening rooftop chase, the psychedelic nightmare sequence, the gorgeous Bernard Herrmann music, the eerie art gallery scene.

He even had to do nothing - only walk hither and tither and watch with his ""eyes of stone"" - a famous innovation of Hitchocock. But Hitch himself, IMHO, was NOT at his best in Vertigo. I'll explain why.First of all, an experienced detective would have noticed that the girl who fell into the San- Francisco bay (what a romantic way to commit suicide! is to fell into the San-Francisco bay!.. pardon me) - that this girl has flatten her hands and doesn't sink - because she didn't want to! This was her performance. Such a detective is not as clever as he should be.Secondly, a terrible way of editing. In the scene discussed above, John takes Madeleine out of the water... now the view from the shore... he carries her in his arms... AND ANOTHER CUT! He continues to carry the girl to her car! What is the purpose of this cut? Jimmy Stewart was not strong enough to carry Kim Novak all the way from the water down to the car FOR A ONE TAKE? This is a terrible mistake that's funny to see from mr. Hitchcock. I don't know what the Master was thinking about, but this scene is unlikely, even an anecdotic one.There's one more editing mistake towards the end of the movie, where Johny and his girl returns to the hotel... a bus runs down the street... and the next cut is a view of the hotel's corridor. The wall is at the left side of the screen, and it seems that the bus runs to the wall. This is inexcusably for Hitchcock.And, of course, a scene in the tower, in which Gavin Elster's wife flyes upside down from the tower. Why Johny who claims to be the experienced detective cannot keep up with Madeleine? A huge mistake, mr. Hitchcock, very unlikely one!Whence, I can give only 5/10.",Vertigo

At times we get the feeling that the scenes are too slow or prolonged more than what is required. What the Judie does in the end is enough to give a shock at the end of the movie but does have a bad effect on the movie. It doesn't make much sense that she suddenly jumps out. And most important the necklace that gives away the mystery is not very convincing. It was too stupid of Judie to wear it for a dinner with Scott. Overall a typical Hitchcock movie which can keep the viewers thinking. I will give a rating of 7 out of 10 for this movie. I have seen better Hitchcock movies.,Vertigo
718,LeeHobbs,"Aggravated acrophobia, clinical depression, and an obsessive-compulsive disorder",10,15 January 2006,"By the time Hitchcock began work on Vertigo, he had already completed nearly sixty motion-pictures. Several of them featured Indiana,Pennsylvania-born Jimmy Stewart who had appeared in over sixty films by 1958. After actor Cary Grant, Stewart was the most frequently featured leading man in Hitchcock's filmography. In addition to Vertigo, Stewart starred in other highly-regarded Hitchcock films such as Rope (1948), Rear Window (1954) and The Man Who Knew Too Much (1956). Vertigo is cited by several film critics as one of the greater examples of American popular film. However, Hitchcock lost the 1958 Academy nomination for best director Vincente Minnelli for directing the musical, Gigi.Warning: some feel that the plot summary alone will ruin the film's sense of mystery for those who have yet to see it. Please skip to the next paragraph to avoid a spoiler. Aggravated acrophobia, clinical depression, and an obsessive-compulsive disorder: the psychological thriller Vertigo is like a psychiatrist's casebook for neuroses. Stewart plays an ex-policeman named Scottie Ferguson who faces an early retirement after suffering a traumatic on-the-job accident that left him with a hideous fear of heights. Gavin, an old acquaintance, convinces Scottie that his wife, Madeleine, is both possessed and suicidal and employs him follow her in secret. Eventually, Scottie does catch Madeleine, played by Kim Novak, in the act of drowning herself in San Francisco Bay and subsequently performs a heroic, Hollywood rescue. The two soon fall in love but the romance ends tragically when Madeleine falls from a tower at an old Spanish mission in California. His anxiety prevented him from climbing the tower fast enough to save her. After witnessing her death, Scottie is afflicted with melancholia, a mental disorder for which he eventually recovers in a hospital. After his release, he meets, by accident, a dead-ringer for Madeline, named Judy, on the street. Scottie befriends Judy, and then becomes fanatical about compelling her to change everything about her external self (eg. fashion choices, hairstyle, and hair color) so that she can more closely resemble his lost beloved, Madeleine. The complex mystery concludes with a twisted, surprise ending that I won't reveal in this blurb.If you get a chance to see the restored version of this film on DVD, you won't be disappointed with the quality. In addition to seeing the colors as they would have been seen in the original theatre release, the film's Foley track (sound effects) was completely redone from scratch in stereo. You may not have known that Hitchcock prepared a different ending (additional footage) that sort of ""tied things up"" for the European audience. This ending is available on the DVD as a bonus feature.Vertigo, as a quintessential Hitchcock creation, was successfully spoofed in 1977 by slapstick director Mel Brookes in his psycho-comedy, High Anxiety. In addition to famous scenes from Psycho (1960), The Birds (1963) and several others, the story line closely follows the details of Spellbound (1948) and Vertigo with the protagonist portrayed by Brooks himself. Even the same shooting locations are used such as the mission tower and the public phone booth by the Golden Gate Bridge.",Vertigo

I'll admit it drug out a little in the middle, but it's still a very fast paced movie- you have no idea what's going to happen. A few highlights: the score, opening scene and final shot. Also, Jimmy Stewart isn't your typical Mr. nice guy this time, weather thats a good thing or not is up to you to judge, but the important thing is he does a good job with the role. Vertigo is true to its title and remains one of the all time best movies from one of all time greatest directors.",Vertigo

Its been called the most personal, emotional, and complex of Hitchcock's films. I agree with all of these things except for one, this film IS Hitchcock's masterpiece work. All of the others pale in comparison to this. There are phenomenal performances here by Jimmy Stewart who plays the biggest anti-hero of his career and Kim Novak whose stunning beauty and exceptional personalities shine through this dark film. Barbara Bel Geddes provides great support as well. Everything about this film, the cinematography, the story, the depth, etc. leaves you mystified and transfixed on this dizzying, surreal artwork of a film. It truly is flawless.

Confused identity of course goes back to antiquity, but this treatment is a whole different take on the idea. Second the execution of colors, music, shooting style are breathtaking and still look, for the most part, fresh today. What is must have looked like at the time! By the way the special features on the DVD are also very good.Now for the problems as I see them. First is Jimmy Stewart. He is credible as a police officer and as someone who had lost his nerve, but as someone who falls obsessively in love; I didn't think it was credible. Plus he is too old for Kim Novak.Spoiler below: Are we really to believe that the murder plot was conceived to include pretending to be suicidal, jumping in the ocean, enticing Stewart, and getting him to climb up a set of stairs to ""witness"" the wrong thing? Told ""mystery style"" where you find one thing out at a time hides the ridiculousness of this part of the plot, yet it is a crucial part of the story.

The plot is absurd -- holes you can drive a truck thru -- clumsy to the point of being comical. Just for one example, the husband apparently breaks his wife's neck somewhere or other, then drags her corpse up a very long flight of stairs in a major public building in broad daylight, reaches the roof unseen, tosses the corpse off (the falling body is immediately seen by all sorts of onlookers) and then gets away clean with an accomplice who is a dead ringer (no pun intended) for the dead wife -- even though the detective is actually on the stairs at the time. (Seems he ran away immediately, leaving the stairs clear and no-one else was coming to investigate. Yeah.)Plot is laughable, characters are about as lifelike and convincing as a snowman after a thaw. Every so often a set of psychedelic special effects reminiscent of the crazy boat trip in Will Wonka. Even basic errors, like the stars consistently driving down the left side of the road in the endless driving scenes.And it goes on and on and on, minute after annoying minute -- two hours plus of inanity. Having read so many good reviews I kept watching, waiting for the moment when it all came together and made sense. Sadly, that moment never came.I have read the glowing reviews that paint this mess as a brilliant psychological drama with someone hovering on the edge of madness, unreliable narrator etc. etc. Emperor's new clothes. It is a poorly written, badly executed waste of time -- and I say this as someone who really likes the true classics, Citizen Kane, Singing in the Rain, Sunset Blvd. etc. I would put this on my list of ""avoid at all costs.""

The metamorphosis Scottie undergoes is the highest emotional arc of a character I have ever witnessed. Kim Novak's inexperience and nervousness led to her stiff portrayal of Madeline.

If you read all of the glowing, pretentious reviews of this film before you watch it, then you're likely setting yourself up for disappointment. Orson Welles thought Vertigo was a very bad film. I disagree. It's an okay film that's worth watching, but it's not worth the accolades that it has received from modern critics. The Good: Jimmy Stewart. Bernard Herrmann's score.

The next half hour unfolds into a murder mystery. This movie once again takes away the viewer by surprise. James Stewart has given a brilliant performance in the role of a private detective who retires from his job because of spells of vertigo. He is offered a job by his close friend to keep an eye on his wife who hasn't been behaving herself lately. After initial hesitation he accepts and in the process fall sin love with her. While following her he believes that a supernatural phenomenon related to her ancestral tragedy as the cause of her bizarre behavior and her tendency to commit suicide. It is Hitchocks style of unfolding the scenes by which he makes the viewer fall into the trick of believing what he wants them to believe. The finale of this movie is amazing.

Next year, in a few weeks, Vertigo will be 60 years old and it will celebrate it on top of the list of The Greatest Films Ever Made overtaking Citizen Kane and many other masterpieces. Why? Maybe when a filmmaker of Hitchcock's greatness taps into his own unconscious and reveals himself. By now we know enough about Hitchcock the man to know he was obsessed in finding that woman who'll look and behave just the way he wants and once he find them, they are destroyed to then embark on a quest to replace or duplicate her. Vera Miles was suppose to be the object of James Stewart's obsession and she opted for motherhood instead. Kim Novak replaced her and her coldness and detachment worked beautifully here. Barbara Bel Geddes the real woman who loves him he doesn't even notice, his focus is in the impossible.The magic touch in Vertigo is truly Bernard Herrmann. Try to see Vertigo without the score. No, don't. This classic is a marriage of images and music. A thriller with an uncomfortable truth at its very center. A personal truth from its filmmaker. I don't know if Vertigo will still be the number 1 in the list a hundred years from now, I will never know but I suspect that it will always be among the top.",Vertigo

One reason I don't like Vertigo is strictly personal - I understand Hitchcock's obsession with Grace Kelly and when she was no longer available he picked each actress and dressed them as he had Miss Kelly(much like the character Scottie does to Judy) but why Kim Novak who is as stiff and cold as her bleached white hair?
But my main reason is because Hitchcock the master of suspense takes it away TOO SOON!
There's NO REASON for him to reveal the truth about Judy right after they met. That could have been kept a secret until they return to the church -she could confess to him and he could say he'd figured it out and that was why he brought her there!
Whenever they get to that part of the movie I turn it off because it's over as far as I'm concerned.

It is Hitch's first color film and it looks really good in color. I also think the costuming is superb. the Los Angeles scenery is pretty cool also.If you are in to classical films like Gone With the Wind or Casablanca this will probably please you.

Oh Scottie, don't let me go."" This quote from Madeleine sure means more than just saying I don't want to die but it also means how we all feel when our loved ones left us which is a part of life. Hitchcock sure did a great job directing Vertigo which is now one of the movies that would live on forever in the history of cinema. The film is based on a book written Hitchcock's two favorite writers, the film takes on a psychological problem around the scores of real people. The protagonist is an Police detective named John ""Scottie"" Ferguson who is asked by an old college friend, Gavin Elster, if he would have a look into his wife Madeleine's odd behavior. Gavin is starting to believe that her odd behavior is the reincarnation of a woman who died many years ago and is concerned about her sanity. Scottie follows her and rescues her from an apparent suicide attempt when she jumps into San Francisco bay. He gets to know her and soon falls in love with her. They go to an old mission church and he is unable to stop her from climbing to the top of the steeple where she jumps to her death. Several months later, he meets Judy Barton, a woman who is the spitting image of Madeleine. He tries to recreate that women into Madeleine image by getting her to dye her hair and wear the same type of clothes. He soon begins to realize he has been duped, and was a pawn in a complex piece of theater that was meant to end in tragedy. The story told through this film was incredible, even though it felt a bit slow at some parts. However, that is exactly the case here. But I can see that Hitchcock drags us on to a long journey, because there is a reason it does that and the conclusion is more than satisfying. I loved my experience watching ""Vertigo"", it just felt like it took a bit too long to get to the point. From the screenplay to the acting, the overall atmosphere of this film screams brilliance. The film's ironic plot twist is the important factor that made this film amazing. Unlike a few of Hitchcock's previous films, Vertigo takes a decidedly mature look at murder. This film has a long history as well as a legacy unlike many of his other films. I think that ""Psycho"" would be the only true rival to this film, though this one feels more like a passion project than the former. It's not the type of film to watch over and over again.

737,lachinimini,Hitchcock's Masterpiece,10,12 July 2000,"Alfred Hitchcock has made so many excellent films that it is both hard and easy to recognize which one is his masterpiece.In an odd way, ""Vertigo"" is his most romantic film, not romantic in the sense of the relationship between James Stewart and Kim Novak, but in the sense of the dark, tragic, lugubrious kind of romance portrayed often in European music from the 1800's.  Scottie's complete surrender to Madeline and his escalating obsession to save her, are characteristics of a man so hopelessly in love that he loses sight of logistics, friends, and morals. Is he attracted to Madeline purely because of her stunning beauty, because of mysteriousness, or to him is she just a problem for him to solve, something to fix and feel gratified about?  Thankfully, Hitchcock never tries to answer these questions, for that would have been too easy.  This is a film that asks questions, and dares you to question yourself.There are moments in this film of unparalleled skill and beauty.  The first moment Scottie sees Madeline in the restaurant, we see her through his eyes, we see her as a goddess, a person to be worshiped, which is exactly what Scottie does.  The sequence in which Scottie is racing up the church tower steps, only to look down and succumb to his paralyzing fear of heights in which the famous ""dolly zoom"" effect is used.  The moment when Judy emerges from the bathroom dressed like Madeline, with an eerie green aura surrounding her.  And the fitting finale, the result of Scottie's love, hate, arrogance, and paranoia.  Bernard Herrman's score (his personal best) heightens each of these moments, whether the emotion he stirs is fear, obsession, or love.  His music for this film deserves to sit on the shelf next to Beethoven, Tchaikovsky, and Puccini as one of the greatest romantic compositions of all time.  It's hard to imagine that at the time of release, it was poorly received and puzzling to the critics and public.",Vertigo
738,paul.goodall,Masterpiece of cinema that is still unequalled!,9,22 August 2000,"Well, what can one say that has not already been said about this undisputed Hitchcock masterwork. Having watched most of the Master's films post-Rope, I had contented myself that North By Northwest would never be beaten, until I clapped eyes on this strange, neurotic, surreal, romantic, haunting drama. Never before in the cinema has there been a story that could wrench at the heart and leave the viewer shaken by its power. Stewart, the one-time All-American Hero of Capra, gives his greatest screen performance as the admittedly sickly minded cop smitten with the mysterious Kim Novak, who never again would get a role this good. Both stars exhume passion, almost burning the celluloid of the print, and Hitch never once loses focus of the story. His surprise revelation of the plot about 2 thirds of the way in may destroy the suspense but it increases the tension in the viewer. HE doesn't know her real identity and SHE only wants him to love her for who she is, not because he is in love with a dead woman who transfixed him. For me the final thirty minutes are probably the most poignant moments the screen has to offer. When the film ends, the viewer is shattered by the tragedy, but goes away enriched with what the cinema can offer, but cannot even come close to achieving again. For me, Vertigo is the best film I have ever seen and, no matter how many times I see it, I still come away with the same reaction - goosebumps and a lump in the throat.

So, without going into plot, Vertigo has three features which set it apart for me... Vertigo captures a snap shot of San Francisco which acts as more than an incidental backdrop for a movie.  Hitchcock fell in love with the Bay City and had decided years before he would film a thriller spanning its hilly streets and monuments. Second, Herrmann's soundtrack is among the most haunting and memorable of any movie.  Rarely has another soundtrack so successfully created a mood that a movie would have lacked otherwise. Finally, for me, the overall dreamy milieu of Vertigo not only sets it apart from other Hitchcock thrillers, but also makes it one of those films that haunts and grows in my conscience as time passes.  When first released, Vertigo received lukewarm appraise from audiences and critics alike.  Seen as Hitchcock's most personal endeavour, Vertigo has gradually been elevated to the rank of timeless classic.  I envy anyone who views it for the first time.",Vertigo

If I had to name the best Bernard Herrmann score, it would be very easy to argue for Vertigo. On display here is an utterly complete exercise in dramatic storytelling. The handling of tension in harmony and melody is second, if not equal to, Wagner himself. The love theme is one of the greatest creations of sound I have ever heard. Very interestingly, throughout the first half of the film, Herrmann establishes another melody to represent Madeleine - it can very easily be thought of as the love theme in the first half. However, once things turn dark and James Stewart's love obsession begins, this theme morphs into the famous, appoggiatura infested gut-wrencher of a theme. Vertigo is a film about obsession, and to represent this in the score, Herrmann continuously, again and again, returns to the melody in an agonizing way. It is not fully resolved until the end of the love scene, just like the Tristan chord (Wagner's opera ""Tristan und Isolde"") 93 years earlier. Herrmann new exactly what he was doing and who he was borrowing from.",Vertigo

She is the constant that highlights Scottie's fall into obsession. The painting is Midge's own cry for help. Her desperate attempt for Scottie's attention, all of which is now totally focused on Madeline.As for Vertigo overall, it's a brilliant example of Hitchcock's mastery of image.

It is more than a psychological thriller, a drama or a ""colorful film noir"". Superb dialogues, a beautiful shot of San Francisco, which seems to be intentionally strange -and not the well-known american city- and, of course, Vertigo give us the best James Stewart and Kim Novak performances. There is no much to say about the score: the opening credits are not as easy to listen as ""Psycho"" or ""North by Northwest"", and the fascinating ""scene d'Amore"" (where Stewart finally changes Novak into another Novak) is just a variation of ""Tristan und Isolde"" prelude (R.

He  transforms Stuart from the Aw Shucks character we all love, to an obsessive, anxiety-driven flawed human being.  And Kim Novack- how did she learn to act so quickly?  Her performance is breathtaking to say the least. What makes Vertigo very enjoyable for me is that it's a love story disguised as a  detective thriller.  Sure, the suspense is there, and more effective than ever, but  this movie is about LOVE.  Oh, love justifies why Judy lets Scotty do those horrible things to her.  Love explains why Scotty loses her in the first place.   Hitchcock has proven himself as the master of suspense, but I think that this film,  along with Notorious, elevates him to a director that understands the burning  passion that can exist between two people. The music, once again Bernard Herman has come through, really ties the film together.  There is actually more music than dialog, setting the mood and hypnotizing us ever so gently.  The nightmare sequence is reason enough to see it- so abstract, so expressionistic.  Finally, the use of color and> cinematography bring forth a dimension that was totally new and unexpected in  Hollywood. I would argue that Vertigo is Hitchcock's best film.  I would argue that it's even  one of the best American films ever.",Vertigo
751,Rick_McAuner,An amazing film that takes the viewer beyond their expected destination.,10,15 October 2007,"Alfred Hitchcock's 1958 film Vertigo is an adventure into the human mind. Scottie Ferguson, the main character, has to deal with his vertigo. Hitchcock takes an interesting turn in his storytelling when the viewer believes the tale is through. His use of the color green plays a very prominent roll throughout the film. The dialog is well thought out, but more importantly Hitchcock's use of vocal silence during the chase scenes between Madeleine and Scottie really brings a level of suspense normally not seen in today's films. Generally television shows rely heavily on dialog to tell the twenty minute story that the writers have created. Hitchcock's style allows him to fully demonstrate his vision to the audience. He takes the time to completely elaborate the suspense in various scenes, bringing the emotional draw to a peak. I enjoyed the twist where the film seemed to be over after Madeleine dies. The story had all its loose ends tied up, everything seemed to have fallen neatly in place for what was a good movie. Then it continues and Hitchcock runs with a continuing storyline that builds impressively off the first. He successfully follows through in giving a compelling presentation of the human psyche as seen in Scottie's development and decline in Vertigo. I highly recommend this film since it is a masterpiece of what film should be. Hitchcock's brilliance shines during the entirety of this picture, ranging from the great camera setups and impressive panning shots that really show off San Francisco to the simplicity in the colors of a scene. Hitchcock was very talented in bringing together the cast, sounds, images, and his vision to create this masterpiece on film.",Vertigo
752,jfreak-alvaro,The Best Hitchcock Movie,10,8 August 2008,"Those who are not sure of cinema-goers say that the best film Hitchcok is Psychosis. But in reality Vertigo has no rival.Hitchcok has been highlighted by his ideal of telling a story with emphasis on images rather than words. And without this place doubts it does so with a master's total.Vertigo is a love story that ends as only Hitchcok know, with the heart in his hand. Each plane and angle of the film is a delight to the eye of the viewer. Since planes that make long-shot look to the city of San Francisco as well as close-ups that until can make us feel on the skin of the protagonists.And in this case, Kim Novak and James Stwart are wonderful. It is the only film I've seen of this woman but I think it will enough. The chemistry that makes with Stwart is the best I've seen in my life. Although I believe the actions of James is millimeters below that Rear Window, the feeling of love that prints Novak into his character makes it unforgettable and unrivaled.But besides the fantastic direction of Hitchcok (as always, but this time is perfect), a dash with a perfectly structured and Finale of the best of all time makes this work the best his filmography.",Vertigo
753,cliffjohns36,Not nearly up to the usual Hitchcock standards on detail and logic.,2,13 August 2008,"I side with those who have criticized this film as being exceptionally poor by Hitchcock standards. While Psycho, North By Northwest, Suspicion, Dial M For Murder, et al, employed the virtues of logic and rationality coupled with Hitch's normal dose of high suspense, this film fails in nearly every way to convey the seeds of reality. Thus I couldn't appreciate whatever suspense it tried to conjure. The whole storyline seemed flooded with improbabilities, illogical sequences, flawed reasoning, and implausible character acts & emotions. It's hard to imagine that Hitchcock was responsible for this film, or that James Stewart, Kim Novak, and Barbara Bel Geddes agreed to act in it. Just for starters, why in the world would a spouse cook up a scheme this ultra-elaborate & complicated to do away with his wife? Wouldn't arsenic or an auto accident be simpler to arrange? And why would he decide to frame one of his closest friends, anyway? How could the dead wife be toted up that long spiral stairs at the bell tower by a man in his sixties? And would he really allow for the risk of being detected while making that long climb up? How could Madeline (Judy)adore a man she was also setting up as a patsy? Why would she stay around after the murder and risk being identified as an accomplice, as indeed she finally was? Why would she allow easygoing Scottie to coerce her into wearing all those new clothes and unraveling her disguise after seeing that he was suspicious? For that matter, why would she permit herself to be prodded into climbing the belltower stairs once she realized he was on to her? Her resistance seemed token. Maybe there are explanations for these and 100 other things I didn't understand, but together they ruined the film for me.",Vertigo
754,lwa02mg,Hitchcock's Crowning Achievement. Watch it!,10,19 February 2003,"SPOILERS?!? Jimmy Stewart (John 'Scottie' Ferguson) is hired to follow Kim Novak (Madeleine Elster) around the streets and sights of San Francisco.  The twenty or so minutes when this is taking place is almost entirely devoid of dialogue.  All we, as an audience, have to do is simply watch their movements around the city.  Only Alfred Hitchcock could pull a sequence of this kind off and achieve what he himself referred to as 'pure cinema' - telling a story solely through what we see, not what we hear.  It is one of my favourite sections of any movie, let alone Vertigo itself.  This section of the film is a masterpiece all by itself.
Yet the whole film is a work of art.  To watch a man become inextricably obsessed with a woman to the point that he makes up another woman to look just like her is saddening and sickening!  It should make us turn our eyes away with disgust, at least with dismay.  Yet Hitchcock had the uncanny knack to know exactly what an audience could bear (Rear Window being the par excellence).  Nobody can resist voyeuristic temptations forever and he knew it, preying on and manipulating that knowledge to such an effect that we become as obsessed as Scottie the longer we watch.  To cast Jimmy Stewart, the representation in many films (It's a Wonderful Life and Harvey for example) of the 'everyman', in this role was an extremely brave move, but I'm positive Hitchcock knew that it was impossible for this to fail, and Stewart serves up one of the best performances of his long and distinguished career; not once did I feel that his slow and definite descent into madness and obsession was somehow 'fake'.
Everything in Vertigo is faultless.  Kim Novak's dual performance as the ice-cool Madeleine and the needy, insecure Judy is confidently assured, if nothing else adding to the believability of the declining mental state of Scottie, despite the best intentions of Scottie's best friend 'Midge' - sometimes the best intentions are the worst intentions.   The score is provocatively haunting, a perfect and necessary accessory to the slow-burning, suspenseful tone and all together surreal atmosphere of the movie.  That atmosphere is created by great cinematography; the fantastically bright colours seem eerily out-of-place, the fogless and cloudless city somehow adding to the provocative, obsessive nature of the movie.  A lot of this effect is amazing - Vertigo being not far short of 50 years old - therefore a lot of credit must go to those who have so painstakingly restored this classic of cinema to such an extent that it perhaps is in better condition now than even when it was first shown!
Ultimately though, the genius of Vertigo lies with Hitchcock.  He manages to time the pace of the events perfectly; the story never feels to be dragging along as some might say, IT IS NEVER BORING; nor do the events unfold too quickly, which would rob the audience of the suspense which Hitchcock was famed for.  You get the sense that in the hands of anyone else this film would have been a disaster, being too complex and lacking that compulsive 'must-see' element; only Hitchcock, the master of suspense, could weave out of such a knot of intricacies a work of such technical brilliance.  He was, of course, much more than just the master of suspense, he was the king of storytelling, and Vertigo was his pinnacle.  With careful thought, anyone could see that this is a fantastic movie, proving that films do not need colossal explosions or bucket-loads of violence and profanity to be entertaining.  What is necessary is a simple, yet great story and people who can act well.  In Vertigo you have the best of both, but most of all you have Alfred Hitchcock at the helm, the greatest director ever!",Vertigo
755,banagadaga,A Deeply Flawed Diamond,5,12 August 2012,"This is a film of very mixed quality. The first hour and 25 minutes of this 2 hour 10 minute film are incredibly, almost inconceivably, boring and consist mostly of close ups of James Stewart's face while he silently drives around tailing a delusional, deranged woman.At this point of the movie the story seems to be about a woman who thinks she was someone who died 200 years earlier in a past life. Watching this stage of the film is a profoundly boring experience and is an astonishing 75% of the movie! The characters, the situations they find themselves in and especially the dialog, everything about that first 85 minutes in fact, is so bland and boring it's hard to sit through it. After 45 minutes of James Stewart looking in his rear view mirror and mugging to the camera you need serious commitment not to abandon ship.Oddly for Hitchcock, the problem is that there is simply a complete lack of suspense. We simply don't care that she thinks she is a reincarnated woman from the 1790's because that storyline doesn't seem to be going anywhere in particular as the only explanation is that the character is insane, so it isn't interesting to watch James Stewart follow her around and watch her run her delusional errandsThe last 35 minutes, from the (deservedly) famous dream sequence onward are compelling. I didn't see that twist coming and anyone who says they did (as a few reviewers claim) is lying. Incidentally, the so called plot holes are easily explained away with any number of possible explanations.For the first time there is something interesting going on. Where before the dialog consisted of banal exchanges between Stewart and Barbara Bel Geddes that simply padded out the movie and served to advance the plot by letting the viewer know what was going on (without being the slightest bit entertaining), there is a real sense of gripping drama in every exchange as Stewart the mentally fragile retired detective puts it all together and Kim Novak tries to have her cake and eat it, and almost succeeds.I give the first hour and 25 minutes 1 star because it is one of the most tortuously boring sequences anyone has ever bothered capturing on film, and the last 35 minutes 10 stars out 10, averaging the overall score out to 5 stars out of 10. If the first part of the movie was just pruned to perhaps 25 minutes long, or if it had simply been done in a more interesting way, it could have put this movie into an entirely different league.The reason this movie is so overrated (as a whole, notwithstanding it's incredibly powerful final 35 minutes) is simply because as it was unavailable for 30 years from the end of it's original cinematic release until 1986, it's legend grew and grew and it became trendy. The incredibly inaccessible nature of the first 85 minutes appealed to certain types of superficial people we all know. They will tell you that this is Hitchcock's greatest movie, the greatest movie ever made in fact, and if you don't understand that you aren't as smart as them. We know better.",Vertigo
756,justin-ward79,Great characters occupy this excellent thriller,8,5 August 2014,"Upon browsing through critic and user reviews containing varying degrees of appreciation for this film I have decided to share my own thoughts on the so called masterpiece. The two things I have concluded about it are that: (1) No, I believe it is not a flawless piece of cinematic intrigue, but that (2) the movie, regardless of some negative reviews, does have some great characters that work serve the material very well. Now, I say that the film is no masterpiece because of the way the story unfolds. Like many other people who responded negatively to watching this film, I found the it lacking in any suspense and/or tension whatsoever in some parts (and all parts after the letter writing scene) and that seriously dulls down the movie to some extent. Where some may go on to deride the characters and acting, however, my problems cease with the previously stated story issues and a few illogical hiccups (Ferguson's silence and the perfect doppelgänger to name a couple). I believe that the characters are very well done and the fact that you get to view both leads and see their sides as the mystery unfolds really does balance well against the lack of suspense. It was actually quite entertaining with this mystery that continued to keep me guessing for the first half of the story. I especially enjoyed James Stewart performance as Ferguson and how we start off being thrown in right as his life begins to go downhill and how we continue to watch that turmoil develop. I think it is a very interesting direction to send the character that works even if it probably shouldn't considering it doesn't start with him at a better point in his life first in order to show how far he's fallen. Honestly if the scene where Novak's character was writing that damn letter had appeared later in the film I may have even agreed with calling it a masterpiece.Note: This is just my view of some of what I believe are the more important aspects of this film. I have not seen very many Hitchcock films and as such do not have much insight into how this stacks up with his other films and could easily be missing something in that regard (if that makes any sense). I have also only seen the film once and the film could very well become more enjoyable with future viewings. Oh and sorry for going between I and we so liberally at that one moment. Also for any other butchering of the English language that may it may not be visible throughout.",Vertigo
757,freetobreathe,an amazing ghost story,10,9 January 2014,"Ghosts abound in this film. Why? It's a ghost story.

758,eve_morris,Perfect thriller,10,22 June 2017,"John ""Scottie"" Ferguson is a San Francisco cop who decides to quit the service after his acrophobia results in him being unable to save the life of a colleague. Whilst taking it easy he gets a call from an old school friend, Gavin Elster, asking him if he wouldn't mind doing a little bit of detective work for him. The job is simply to tail his wife because she's obsessed with an ancestress who committed suicide, and the wife, Madeline, is showing signs of herself being suicidal. Ferguson tails her diligently and as the tail progresses, Ferguson himself starts to become ever obsessed about the demur blonde Madeline. As the story twists and turns, Ferguson's obsession will have far reaching consequences for both parties... Vertigo is Alfred Hitchcock's most discussed, dissected and critically reappraised film, based on a novel by Pierre Boileau called D'Entre Les Morts, (also writer of Diabolique), Vertigo was not well liked on its release and unable to be viewed for some time due to copyright, the film was restored from a destroyed negative into a glorious 70mm print, and now in all its glory it can be seen as one of the greatest films to have ever been made. What is most striking about Vertigo, outside of Hitchcock baring his innermost that is, is that its plot on the surface is simplicity personified, but delving deeper, and repeat viewings are a necessity, its apparent that Vertigo is a chilling force of cinema, taking great delight in gnawing away at your perceptions, perhaps even your own capabilities as a human being. Very much a film of two great halves, Vertigo first seems intent on being an almost ghost story like mystery. Once the prologue has introduced us to Ferguson's fear of heights, we then enter an almost dream like sequence of events as Ferguson tails the troubled Madeline, the suggestion of reincarnation bleakly leading to death hangs heavy as Hitchcock pulls his atmospheric strings. Then the film shifts into dark territory as obsessions and nods to Dante's Inferno and feverish dreams take control, Hitchcock, as we have come to learn over the years, lays out his soul for us the audience to partake in, the uneasy traits sitting side by side with fascination of the story. All of which is leading us to a spine tingling finale that is as hauntingly memorable as it is shocking, the end to our own dizzying journey that Alfred and his team have taken us on. Technically the film is magnificent, the opening credits from Saul Bass brilliantly prep us for what is about to unfold, while Bernard Herrmann's score is as good as anything he ever did, unnerving one minute, swirlingly romantic the next, a truly incredible score. Hitchcock himself is firing from the top draw, introducing us to the brilliant zoom-forward-track-back camera technique to induce the feeling of Vertigo itself, with that merely a component of two hours of gorgeous texture lined with disturbing little peccadilloes. The two leads are arguably doing their respective career best work, James Stewart as Scottie Ferguson goes real deep to play it out with an edgy believability that decries his aw-shucks trademark of years since past. Kim Novak as Madeline is perhaps the quintessential Hitchcock blonde, perfect with the duality aspects of the role and playing off Stewart's ever creepy descent with seamlessly adroit skill. It however should be noted that Hitchcock and his loyal subjects had to work hard to get Novak right for the role, but the result proves that Novak had ability that sadly wasn't harnessed on too many other occasions. Vertigo is a film that I myself wasn't too taken with on my first viewing, it's only during revisits that the piece has come to grab me by the soul and refuse to let go, it not only holds up on revisits, it also gets better with each subsequent viewing, it is simply a film that demands to be seen as many times as possible. Not only one of the greatest American films ever made, one of the greatest films ever made...period, so invest your soul in it, just the way that Hitchcock himself so clearly did. 10/10",Vertigo

763,lordchootapa,Misses Me..,3,31 December 2015,"I do not understand why James Stewart spent basically the entirety of his early career allowing himself to be typecast as nice, respectable, clean-cut (albeit a bit goofy) young guys, only to later be cast by Hitchcock to play touchy, ornery, grouchy older guys who, despite their actual younger age, act like 80 year old men whose neighbors are playing the music too loudly. That's a huge, number one issue with Vertigo, and maybe the only issue (for me) with Rear Window.In Vertigo, Stewart plays a detective newly suffering from Acrophobia (fear of heights) and of course, Vertigo. He's asked by a friend to investigate his (the friend's) wife, odd behavior, and see what she gets up to during the day. Meanwhile, in a basically unnecessary subplot, Stewart's old flame (played by Barbara Bel Geddes) is yet another obviously far younger blonde who just can't seem to get enough of the guy, vying for his attention, although she never can quite seem to get it right, either infuriating him with a painting, or simply by not being as interesting as Kim Novak.There are several problems I had with this movie, one being the gigantic lack of chemistry between the characters. In order to make the insane obsession thing that ends up overpowering Stewart work, he needs to actually seem into Kim Novak when she's Madeleine, but what he does doesn't really come off that way, he seems angry a lot of the time, even when he's just tailing her, seeing what she's up to. The only time I saw his ""love"" for her was when she came by his apartment to drop off the thank-you note. He seemed genuinely enamored of her, although not nearly enough so to justify the ludicrous obsession that drives him to transform Judy into Madeleine later on. Barbara Bel Geddes' has an obsession of her own with Stewart. This makes sense in the way that most of the pairings do in these movies: they're Hitchcock's fantasies. Although the scene where Stewart sees Bel Geddes' painting and totally overreacts really didn't make any sense to me, at least it was good for a laugh.Another issue is the timeline. Not so much that things aren't in the right order, but more that the first ""half"" of the story, takes more than half the movie. ""Madeleine"" doesn't fall off the roof until past half, yet there's still the whole ""Judy"" storyline to get through. Both story lines are upsetting and creepy, but I'd say the scene in the department store with Judy takes the cake.One thing this movie really has going for it, however, is the setting. There's a remarkable amount of on-location shooting (in San Francisco). Considering the lengths Hitchcock went to avoid having to leave the comforts and control of the studio, it's pretty impressive to view this movie. The Palace of the Legion of Honor Museum is showcased a few times, a nice treat for those who have been there (you can even see statues out front that remain there today) the interior seems to have changed since, but it's still interesting to see. There's real footage of streets, storefronts, graveyards, buildings, forests, ocean/seaside areas, missions, etc. and it's all extremely beautiful. The scene in the forest is effectively creepy and eerie, and the scene by the sea was effectively dramatic. Ludicrously fake as they were, I liked both Stewart's and Bel Gedde's apartments. For me, a movie can be somewhat redeemed if the setting feels good, and in Vertigo's case, the setting was the only reason to watch.",Vertigo

768,VosikTheArchpriest,The peak of Hitchcock's career,10,29 February 2020,"Alfred Hitchcock's Vertigo is currently number 1 on the Sight and Sound Critics' Poll and number 9 on AFI's Top 100 and it's honestly really not hard to see why that's the case. It is, in my opinion, Hitchcock's best film and one of the best movies ever made in general.Vertigo is definetely one of those films that gets better with every viewing. At first, I was expecting the usual Hitchcock Thriller, but this is something much more than that. It is a very compelling Mystery Thriller with a good story and slow pacing in the first half and a great love story with one of the best twists in cinematic history in the second half.When you know the twist (Gavin killed his wife and wanted Judy Barton to play his wife so that Scottie would believe she killed herself) the first half becomes even better because you can try to find out how Hitchcock tricked you into believing that Scottie was following Gavin's wife all along and the film becomes even more admirable. During every scene with Gavin and Scottie you will be able to analyze how Gavin made Scottie believe his whole story, and this becomes better when you look at the way some of the scenes are blocked. There are of course many themes like love, obsession, and how Scottie falls in love with the idea of Gavin's wife and not herself and having so many themes on top of having a ""normal"" Thriller as the main narrative is really difficult to achieve, making Vertigo's Screenplay one of the greatest Screenplays ever written.Almost every aspect of Vertigo is flawless. As I have said before, the writing is incredible, but the same thing could be said about the acting (especially James Stewart), the characters, the cinematography and the music. The music is arguably the best of Herrmann's career and perfectly fits the twisted and surreal atmosphere of the film. It also sounds a bit ""insecure"" if that's the correct word, especially ""Scene d'Amour"", one of the best pieces of music ever created for a film, because it perfectly describes Scottie's character. The cinematography is beautiful; especially in the opening scene and in the Golden Gate Bridge scene. Saul Bass' title sequence in combination with Herrmann's incredible score once again shows Scottie's future obsession and the surreal aspects of the film, perfectly capturing everything Vertigo has to offer. The film also has many iconic scenes, especially Scottie's Nightmare, which is very well made considering Vertigo came out in the 1950s. The ending is one of the most heart-breaking experiences for any character ever. Scottie lost the woman he loved and he also lost his Vertigo. So in the end, he is in the same situation as before the film started; he has no wife and no Vertigo. And yet the viewer feels sorry for him because of all he had to go through, just because Gavin wanted to get rid of his wife.Hitchcock also used colours as a way of conveying information that wouldn't be possible in a Black and White film. There's one scene where Scottie sees that the only thing ""wrong"" with Judy is the colour of her hair (he wants it to be blonde). Of course, seeing the ""wrong"" hair colour wouldn't be possible in a B&W film, so Hitchcock made the film in colour, not to make the film more mainstream, but to be able to convey information that would be impossible to convey in a Black and White film, similar to what Fritz Lang did with sound in his film M in 1931.In the end, Vertigo has one of the greatest Screenplays ever written, with an extremely complex and deep story about love & obsession, it has a great cast, excellent cinematography and music, so many iconic and unforgettable scenes and one of the best endings of all time, which is why it is one of my favourite films of all time and undoubtedly my favourite Hitchcock film.",Vertigo

For anyone who likes Hitchcock but hasn't seen this movie, and for anyone who has even heard about Alfred hitchcock let's get this out of the way, this is hitchcock's masterpiece. Psycho was a great film, and it's right up there  too, but Vertigo wins. I won't go into a lengthly analysis of the film, if you're reading this you've probably read the analysis. This is Alfred Hitchcock at his best, surreal visuals and incredible suspense, even more so than his other great picture, Psycho. The score by Bernard Hermann is possibly the best i have ever heard in a motion picture, adding to the suspense especially in the dream sequence. Unlike some of the people in the reviews before i'm deliberatly trying not to reveal the plot, i saw it the first time, without knowing what the story was, and not realy knowing that much about hitchcock and i was absolutely blown away. I think that's all i really need to say, i think that this is Hitchcock's greatest film and is required viewing for any lovers of suspense along with Psycho, of course, North by Northwest, Strangers on a Train and the 39 steps.

770,lbangs,Everybody's dizzy...,4,12 November 1999,"Some films are able to twist time to their advantage. Few contemporary critics cared for Vertigo when it debuted (though some will lie otherwise). Today, critics have enshrined it as Hitchcock's finest. A shame.Vertigo's first hour is hypnotic. Jimmy Stewart, a retired cop who suffers from the title ailment, is persuaded by a friend to follow his wife, suicidal Kim Novak, for her own protection. One especially excellent scene involves Stewart examining Novak as she walks through a garden and studies a picture. The mystery seeps through the film's atmosphere, and the scene is quietly beautiful in a way Hitchcock seldom is.Eventually, Novak does kill herself, and so does the film. Stewart soon meets a woman closely resembling Novak and grows obsessed with her. There is a plot twist, but it is so terribly transparent I doubt anyone is surprised. Unfortunately, what little suspense lurks in the second half hinges on this twist, negating Hitchcock's supreme talent. Characters begin acting with little or no believable motivation, and Stewart descends into frenzied rants and raves that are pretty funny to watch. The surprise ending is foolishly revealed before the ending, and when the final scene finally arrives, the melodrama is hilarious. The film nosedives after a promising start and wrecks itself.Critics praise the second half of the film as self-revelation on the part of Hitchcock. Maybe, but most people do not watch films because they care about the director. They watch films because they like films, and Hitchcock's films are more interesting than Hitchcock himself. Naturally, Hitchcock scholars are interested in Hitchcock, and this interest accounts for Vertigo's inflated reputation. The sad truth is Vertigo is a flawed failure.I'm wagering time will straighten itself out.

771,Wyatt-9,Beautiful but vastly overrated,3,24 July 1999,"Vertigo has all the makings of a masterpiece except one: a compelling story. The twist is blatantly obvious twenty minutes into the film, and the romance of the film falls completely flat, so to speak.  Ultimately, for all of Hitchcock's vibrant colors, striking camera angles, and the thrilling dream sequence, we simply do not care whether the characters live or die. Overall, a very disappointing film, but worth watching nevertheless for fans of Hitchcock's work.  Vertigo is a remarkable instance of the whole being less than the sum of its parts.",Vertigo
772,loco-11,James Stewart,10,17 August 1999,"Brilliant, captivating movie. I had to see it in the theater to appreciate how truly haunting Vertigo is.By the way, anyone who says James Stewart is wrong for the role of Scotty or that it's a change of character for him, should not be judging him by his Frank Capra movies alone, he made just three of them. His range of emotion and his ability to convey so much through facial expression (so important in Vertigo and Rear Window) are really evident in his Anthony Mann westerns. He was perfect for this movie.",Vertigo
773,solimeo,Hitchcock at his best!,10,29 May 2000,"This is the best film of Sir Alfred Hitchcock. As many masterpieces, it wasn't a hit when it first appeared in 1958; it was considered too dark and complex, and its subtle qualities were overseen. James Stewart plays his best role as  Scottie, a detective who is asked by a friend to follow his wife. And what a wife she is: Kim Novak, the prototype Hitchcock blond: cold, mysterious, sensual, beautiful. Vertigo is more of a love story than a thriller, and that's all I can tell you, I suppose, without spoiling anything. Watch it and, also, HEAR it; its soundtrack, by Bernard Hermann, is an important part of the film, adding to the tragic and supernatural plot.",Vertigo
774,jwa007,"A valiant, but flawed effort by The Master (Possible Spoilers)",7,15 July 2006,"Vertigo is a good movie by a great director. Viewing Vertigo several times recently, and reading Dan Aulier's brilliant in-depth look at the making of this movie, I am at a loss to explain what I see as a vastly hyperbolic reaction to this movie by many people both in the realm of professional critics and posters on IMDb. This is not Hitchcock at his best, although I do believe it could have been. True, Hitchcock was at his peak in this period, but there are enough flaws in Vertigo to bring this potential masterwork down several notches.The first problem in Vertigo lies with the story's failure to establish Scottie Ferguson. We first meet Scottie as he fails to make the rooftop leap and is hanging by a gutter of a building several dozen feet from the ground. After this we see him making his decision to retire from police work. The audience is deprived of any referent to the type of person Scottie was before the incident on the rooftop. This failure to establish the character and set a benchmark to measure his return by in the closing minutes of the film deprives the audience of a vital connection to any character. But this problem could have easily been overcome had the third fatal flaw, which I will take up soon, been avoided.The second problem in Vertigo is a decision by Hitchcock and George Tomasini, the editor, to insert a scene shortly after Scottie meets Judy that reveals all of the secrets the story holds. This throws away the element of suspense that might have had audiences on the edge of their seats during the final part of the movie, unable to relax even at the moment of revelation for Scottie's character as the movie would sweep them up and hurl them through the roller-coaster ride that the climax of the movie should have been. But I think Hitchcock and company made the decision as a direct result of an even earlier and worse mistake.The third, and most glaring, mistake Hitchcock made with Vertigo was in the casting. Most of the cast does work ranging from passable to outstanding, with one notable exception: Jimmy Stewart. In Aulier's account of the Vertigo project he details how Stewart came to star in this movie, which had a lot more to do with the desires of Lew Wasserman, agent to both Stewart and Hitchcock, than good judgment. Jimmy Stewart was the wrong man for this role, and Aulier recounts that Hitchcock himself blamed Stewart for Vertigo's dismal showing at the box office. Hitchcock concluded that Stewart was too old for the part and refused to cast him in North by Northwest because of this. But I don't think Stewart's age was the real hindrance here, I think Jimmy Stewart tried to step way beyond his range as an actor and falls flat in certain key scenes. Mr. Stewart does a passable job in the first half of the movie, and is quite believable as the ex-detective brought low by his vertigo-inducing acrophobia. The first real hint of trouble comes in the last scene of the first half, Scottie sits in a sanitarium incommunicado and withdrawn as his stalwart friend Midge tries to engage him in conversation. Stewart's playing of this borders on the comedic with a deer-in-the-headlights gaze that calls to mind one of the Warner Brother's toons after being conked on the head rather than a man ravaged by guilt. It drags the scene down so much that Barbara Bel Geddes is left to carry it on her own, and she does make a valiant attempt but her efforts are hindered by Stewart. From this point forward the movie enters its most crucial phase and Stewart's ineffectualness grows more obvious in each successive scene. In the scene where Scottie tries to convince Judy to change her hair color Stewart's phrasing and pitch are semi-comedic. The lack of chemistry between the two leads brings the haunting scene of Judy's emergence from the bathroom to a crashing halt as Stewart is unable to infuse his performance with even a modicum of passion. But a few minutes later Stewart's performance goes completely south as the movie's climatic moments unfold. Scottie is righteously angry as the truth dawns on him, but, unfortunately, Stewart does not play angry well at all. His maniacal and slightly feminine delivery from this point on detracts from what could have been cinematic magic. At a point in the movie where Scottie should have regained his senses and his sense of manhood his tone and pitch shrilly foreshadow the strident tones of Mrs. Bates in Hitchcock's next project.No doubt my remarks here will be met with disdain by some of the film's more ardent boosters on IMDb. I shall join the ranks of the great unwashed heathens who do not understand great cinema nor Vertigo's rightful placement at the apex of that pyramidal structure. I do appreciate Hitchcock's use of color as subtext in the film (I am particularly fond of the color and lighting shifts in Midge's apartment when she allows Scottie to view her painting). I also appreciate and easily grasp the undertones of Hitchcock's own obsessive behavior with the leading ladies of his work, but wonder if that subtext was intended as dramatic irony or whether Mr. Hitchcock was even aware of the mirror he was peering into. But, the brilliant touches of a master artist are not enough to make up for what this film lacks. Hitchcock was indeed The Master, and his body of work stands above a field of mostly mediocre efforts that his peers were turning out, and even today not one exists who can approach his mastery, but to suggest that Vertigo is the cinematic equivalent of Leonardo's Mona Lisa is ludicrous and undeserved.",Vertigo
775,glader,A beautifully structured film.,10,31 July 2000,"After reading through many of these comments, I was surprised that I hadn't seen anyone mention the importance of the film's most evocative image - the spiral. More specifically, a double spiral.This image first catches our eye on the poster art. We are shown it again during the beautiful opening sequence. Most apparently seem to view this as a symbol of Jimmy Stewart's fear of heights, however every detail of the film reflects this shape.It appears in Carlotta's hair in the painting and again in Madeline's hair. Even the bouquet of flowers suggests the pattern.(possible spoilers ahead) The movie's real brilliance is using the pattern to structure the story. The movie repeats itself twice. Scottie's visit to the restaurant where he first lays eyes on Madeline. The visit to Carlotta's grave. The art gallery. The shopping spree. Spying Kim Novak enter a hotel and open a window. The scenes at the mission. Almost every event that happens in the first half of the film is repeated in the second. Even the geographic locations of the movie seem to follow this pattern, twice spiraling outward from the heart of San Francisco.An amazing film, and part of the fun of multiple viewing is being able to pick up on these subtleties.",Vertigo
776,The42ndGuy,Perfection,10,5 July 2000,"Very, very seldom does every element of a film represent the medium at its best.  The best scenes in this one have unmatched visual flair, a score of substantial inherent beauty and incalculable impact within the film, and acting that doesn't get in the way of the other two.

777,craigandsally,"In my limited experience as a film viewer, I consi...",10,8 October 2000,"In my limited experience as a film viewer, I consider this the best movie I have ever seen.  The movie takes a while to get going- after the first couple of viewings, I can fast forward or do a crossword puzzle for the first 20-30 minutes of the movie without worrying about missing anything spectacular, but once it does, it soars.  The performances are wonderful, especially James Stewart, who is mesmerizing as the haunted detective. Hitchcock, almost always a master with the camera, supports the acting with wondrous shots that add to the mystery of the movie.  While some have criticized the movie for a lack of mystery, I believe they miss the point. The mystery of the movie is the relationship between Stewart and Novak, not any particular plot element.  Without giving away the plot, let's just say the viewer is allowed to understand what is going on before the climax, but I think that heightens the interest in how the Stewart/Novak characters will play out their roles in this psychological drama.  This movie is not exactly the feel-good hit of the summer, as it is painted in very dark colors. The movie's essence is about guilt, self-hatred, and a quest for redemption that spills over into obsession.  That is why, even though the ""mystery"" in the plot is revealed before the end of the movie, that becomes incidental to what is really being discussed by Hitchcock.  I would recommend this movie to anyone, even if you don't care for psychological dramas, just for the Bernard Hermann score.  The film, however, offers much more, more than any other film you will see.",Vertigo

The music was pretty cool and it was the right music for the scene when it came to drama items and so on. Her clothes were very special when she tried to wear as much clothes as the woman she was playing. She also liked the game very well.

792,dpoppyman-1,moviedom's most tragic characters,10,27 August 2006,"Vertigo contains dozens, if not hundreds of nuances that can easily be overlooked when we view it casually. One thing which seems to be unnoticed which is very obvious is the fact that Scottie, Madeleine/Judy, and Midge constitute possibly the most tragic triangle ever portrayed. Midge, in love with a man who doesn't live in the real world, had to end their ""engagement"" unfulfilled. Tries later to enter his fantasy world by superimposing her face on Carlotta's portrait...with disastrous results. Then watches her love in a near catatonic state realizing that he will NEVER be in her world and wanders down the hallway, disappearing into darkness forever. Scottie, the pragmatist, who chases his fantasy to depths unheard of. Losing himself, everything and everyone in his life. Dabbling even in necromancy and attempted resurrection, not to mention domination and manipulation in the extreme. The ultimate subversion of one human being to the will of another to the destruction of all. When Hitchcock shows him teetering at the top of the tower, he is truly suffering from the ultimate form of vertigo, suspended between life and death. Unable to fully live or to find the release of final death. Truly a tragic, doomed figure of Shakespearian, perhaps even Biblical, proportions who has left behind him a wake of loss, disappointment, loneliness and death. A true aggressive annihilator of all he surveys. Then there is Judy. Scottie's equal in every way except that her obsession with destruction is focused mainly on herself. Manipulated by the murderer Gavin Elster, she gladly jumps from the frying pan into the fire to die (twice!) at the hands of Scottie Furguson. She gives herself over entirely to HER obsession and willingly evaporates as a human being just to complete her fantasy. The scene in which she allows Scottie to change her hair and submits to his will (if I let you, will that do it? Will you love me?) is possibly the most tragic movie scene I have ever witnessed. This film is a gold mine. A film-making master at his most revealing and insightful. Hitchcock's films have suspense and thrills, sure. But underneath are great love stories and, yes, tragedy too.",Vertigo
793,eetuenne,Vertigo - The Colour Of Cinema,9,18 June 2021,"Vertigo was released in 1958, during the American New Wave in cinema, in which time period films were starting to be made in more artistic ways. Directors soon realised, that dialogue is not the only way of telling a story, so is cinematography, color and camera positioning and movement. Even though I obviously wasn't alive in 1958, i've heard that Vertigo got many mixed reviews, from those who were ready for the New Wave, and from those who were still stuck in the traditional Old Hollywood filmmaking style.Vertigo by Alfred Hitchock, is in my opinion up there in the most influental movies ever made. Directors like Paul Thomas Anderson and Martin Scorsese have stated that they have been widely inspired by this film, and they've even payed tribute to it in their own films. When you think of influental movies, what comes to your mind? Bicycle Thieves? Dracula? Modern Times? 2001: A Space Odyssey? Citizen Kane? I would say that Vertigo is definitely up there in the most influental films of all time along with the films I briefly mentioned. Come on, it even invented the Vertigo effect/dolly zoom widely known and used among modern filmmakers. Vertigo is one of the films that defined the modern style of artistic filmmaking. It didn't rely on dialogue, like most Hitchcock films, it relied more on filmmaking aspects.Vertigo has amazing cinematography and use of colour. The use of colour here reminds me of Breaking Bad, because of all the meanings behind the shown colours. Now I did not make this up myself, but Andrew Steffan on youtube made an amazing video called ""The Color of Vertigo"" and he explains it better than I can. Basically what he makes of it is that red means John's sense of danger and romance and green has to do with obsession with Madeleine. I'm not going to explain the whole video, and I suggest you watch it for a better understanding. Cinematographer Robert Burks does an amazing job here, and we get some of the most beautiful shots i've seen in 1950's cinema. The most beautiful shots are dream like, and the amazing and significant use of colour really makes it even better.In the middle here I also quickly want to mention that the dream sequences are shot and made very well. They're trippy, creepy and amazing. They are a great example of why color is so important and significant in cinema, and it should be studied in my opinion.Bernard Herrmann has got to be one of the best composers of all time. I don't see nor hear people talk about him much, so I find him very underrated. This man has composed some of the best music in cinema ever, from the calm but gritty music of Scorsese's masterpiece Taxi Driver to Hitchock's horror classic Psycho. He's also made the music to Vertigo, and right from the opening titles, I knew that this is and will be some of the best music from any thriller out there.I find the first act of this film amazing and extremely strong. Although plot isn't the strongest point of this film, it's still great and interesting. I did find the second act to be worse. I don't even frankly know what it is, but after certain events which launch off the second act, I didn't feel as interested as I did in the first. I still was interested, but I found the first act to be the best. As a whole the plot is amazing, and really unique. No one else than Hitchock could've made this film work, not a another soul.Now to close this review, i'll wirte down some small useless things that caught my eye. First off, the lobby and build of the McKittrick Hotel (I think that was the name) looked a lot like The Bates House from Psycho. The placement of the stairs, and the building as a whole in the inside looked oddly similar to The Bates House, or maybe i'm just crazy. I also want to mention that this film gets more mysterious by every scene, and it really builds up tension and reminds us that it was directed by Hitchock. Also, great story and representation of obsession.Vertigo is an amazing film, and it uses the camera in extremely genius ways. I can't decide between this or Psycho, both are some of the most influental and best movies ever made.",Vertigo
794,killservant,Hitchcock's haunting study of human obsession,10,12 June 2008,"Vertigo is a masterpiece. There is no denying that. The entire film is as dizzying to watch as the fear that it tackles, from the whirling opening credits by Saul Bass to the deeply haunting romantic score by Bernard Herrmann. When I first watched 'Vertigo', I will admit that I didn't like it. I was expecting a typical thriller like so many others, such as Psycho and North By Northwest. This film is much deeper, and is very complex psychologically. Stewart gives a terrifying performance of a man stumbling deeper and deeper into a dream world of obsession, and Hitchcock's use of color is extraordinary, and this is shown in a surreal dream sequence that is more terrifying than any other. What is most startling about 'Vertigo' is its genuine emotion throughout. It is not to be classified as a traditional 'happy entertainment' film. So do watch this, and be bowled over by its genius, but you might need a stiff drink afterward.",Vertigo

796,elpablete,Love madness by A.H.,10,23 June 2001,"I was only a child when I saw Vertigo for the first time, and I can remember that I was very disappointed. I was very fond of Hitchcock's films by that time, mainly because of its marvelous stories about people in dangerous situations and the thrilling things that happened to them, and that's what I thought Vertigo was going to be. But after all I found it rather boring, perhaps because I didn't understand Scottie´s attitude.However, now I´m a few years older, I see Vertigo (and many other Hitchcock's movies) with different eyes. Detective plot is the subject which I am less concerned inside them (though I keep a high interest), and love affair is now what makes me think that these pictures are really special.Nobody ever gave us such a romantic sight of loving obsession for a dead woman as Hitch did with Vertigo, and I have never seen such a touching ""amour fou"" tale. And  that's the reason which turns Vertigo into an unforgettable and unique film and differentiates it from other works by the same author, like Notorious or Rebecca. Vertigo's psychological depth is probably only reached by Hitchcock with Marnie, another non-conventional romance.In addition to that we can enjoy the wonderful performances of Jimmy Stewart (progressively out of his usual role of prudent man as the story moves forward) and Kim Novak (better actress than what some people think and perhaps the most beautiful woman I have seen on a screen).But Vertigo is one more thing: it's a film about a city. San Francisco was never so well portrayed (those hills, those neighborhoods, those houses...), and many of us have learned to love it starting from this picture.",Vertigo

803,james.king@optusnet.com.au,A Standard Rave,10,10 July 2002,"Starting in 1958, Alfred Hitchcock directed a remarkable sequence of films in a row, each of them a classic; Vertigo (1958), North by Northwest (1959), Psycho (1960) and The Birds (1963). Never has a director made four such genuinely great movies in such a short space of time, either before or since.The pick of this high standard bunch is undoubtedly Vertigo. From the opening titles, with their circling spiral imagery, to the dramatic final scene this is a movie that takes you to a different time and place. Specifically, to a San Francisco of the past; full of deserted parks, discrete rooming houses, oddly menacing art galleries and florists where the customers enter and exit through the back door. Through this landscape wanders Jimmy Stewart, towering in the lead roll as a former detective recently retired after a bungled arrest leaves him with chronic vertigo. Plot machinations lead him to the alluring Kim Novak (one of Hitchcock's famous ""blondes""), the young wife of a friend who has started behaving rather oddly.""To reveal more,"" as Leonard Maltin wrote, ""would be unthinkable.""While the performances of Novak and Stewart are memorable, the movie is really set apart by the intelligent script and the stylistic touches provided by the director. Hitchcock is in his very best form creating hypnotic scenes and a general sense of unease and dread in even the most banal of situations. He is aided in this by the wonderful score of Bernard Herrman. A particular favourite of mine is the extended (largely silent) segment where Stewart follows Novak for the first time. Nothing much happens, but the atmosphere of these scenes is enough to keep you on the edge of your seat!One of the all-time greats. They definitely don't make them like this anymore.",Vertigo

It did have some very cool camera shots, most notably the kiss where they embrace and they rotate the room to take him ""back in time"" to the  carriage house.  I bet that shot would be easy to do nowadays, but I wonder how they did it back in 1958.",Vertigo

Not only because this movie is generally viewed as Hitchcock's best (and several other Hitchcock movies are ranked higher on the list) but also because this movie is ranked at number two at the famous 'Sight and Sound'. The plot of the movie is almost incomparable: the viewer is slowly seduced in Scottie's world with all its shortcomings. The music is well chosen: it fits on the one hand the quietness, but one the other hand the tension that can be felt during the whole movie. On his quest for truth the viewer is first mislead on a subtle way. When the movie proceeds the sky becomes clearer. The abrupt end however, leaves the viewer with a 'uncomfortable' feeling: the feeling to put all acts together, to get a better overview. This non Hollywood end makes the film very unique: once out of the cinema one has no possibility not to think/reconsider the movie.",Vertigo

To which his twisted plots and portrayal of love lost can become somewhat repetitive. This film repeats the process. For me its only saving graces are the street scenes of 1950's San Francisco, the cars and the wide shots of the city. Overall there was one and a half hours of build up and then something happens. The last 30 minutes are quicker, showing irrational behaviour tempered with calculated obsession.

I can honestly say this is a spectacular movie on a totally different level compared to movies of today. The story is not a very complex, Its your typical drama/murder-mystery, but the way Big Al had the actors do their scenes was just perfect and this in turn makes the movie very strong and captivating to watch. The cast could not be any greater; Jimmy Stewart' who doesn't know this guy-But the real shocker is the blonde in the gray suit-actress Kim Novak, who I did not know was awesome in this movie.I am a 29 year old guy that has seen his fair share of movies but none that stain my mind the way this one did.

The soundtrack seems to be delayed in some scenes, killing the whole thriller. However, the plot is very interesting and the last 30 minutes makes this big waste of time into a worth it movie.

When I tell someone to see only one Hitchcock film this is it. Not because it displays all of Hitch's talent, but for a greater reason. After having seen nearly forty of his films it seems there is no set style, the PSYCHO ""shower"" scene is not how we should judge Hitchcock, his restraint and minimal work is his best(i.e. SHADOW of a DOUBT, NOTORIOUS, REBECCA). Try not to feel for Stewert's ""Scotty"", it is hard since a lot of us have a little of him in us. It definitely is a film that exists in the universe of Hitchcock films (a man on the run, or falsely accused, or seeking the truth). I promise you will be drawn in.

I saw this film around fifteen years ago and to date it is the best film I have ever seen (and trust me I've seen a fair few). This film is at it's heart about obsession and anyone who has every felt obsessive love in their life will likely make a connection to this film. It has meant different things to me at different stages of my life, and trust me, I've watched this a fair few times.First of all, if you like action films, comedy's or any of the mind-numbingly bad ""blockbuster"" films that have been released in recent years, you will likely not like this film. However, if you prefer character an plot driven movies and also enjoy classic movies, then I would recommend that you definitely watch this.The film itself is split into two very distinct parts. The first half of the film is a mystery / romance that is really just a setup for the second half of the movie where the real meat of the story lies. It is in the second half of the movie where the real drama is and it is handled superbly by Hitchcock, James Stewart and Kim Novak. You will notice that I'm not giving any details of the actually story itself, this is for good reason, you really need to see it yourself.There are several things which makes this film really special for me, mainly the emotional turmoil between both James Stewarts and Kim Novak I the last half of the movie. However, there is one aspect of the film which I have always though was quite ingenious. The twist in the story is not revealed at the end of the story, but actually about 2/3rds into the film. Now rather than spoiling the movie early, this just heightens the emotional anguish when you know the secret that Kim Novak is hiding and makes the tension and drama more powerful.I could list a hundred different reasons why this is film so great, but this would turn into a 20 page essay if I tried. I will simply say that this film should be watched by anyone who truly loves films.",Vertigo

814,Loachee,Jimmy Stewart at his best,10,18 December 2017,"Vertigo has proven to be a timeless classic that has pioneered at least one major filming technique - the Dolly Zoom. With this effect, developed by Irmin Roberts, Hitchcock was able to show the audience the effect of Scottie's acrophobia. The mystery of the story easily captures your imagination, peaking with a famous Hitchcockian twist near the end. Stewart plays a believable and extremely sympathetic character, who is (spoiler) being manipulated without his knowledge the entire film. What starts out as a light-hearted mystery becomes a dark tragedy of Shakespearian proportions. One of the final scenes in which Stewart's character confronts the truth is absolutely heartbreaking. By this time in the movie, we are fully engrossed in the pure intentions of Scottie, and we wish to see him succeed. Once we step back, however, we realize that the ""villain"" has very similar intentions as the ""hero"" in the story. There is one shot in particular which will stand out forever in the minds of audiences and critics. Scottie embraces ""Madeleine"", the camera begins to rotate, the background changes completely in the same shocking shot as the wonderful score plays. Movies like Vertigo will continue to be analyzed by film students for as long as there are film classes.",Vertigo

818,edward-lang-790-938023,A classic that lives up to its reputation,8,13 September 2013,"Vertigo is like a roller-coaster. Not a good roller coaster, the type of roller coaster that takes half an hour to get up to the top and then when it finally gets to the first drop it starts to pick up speed before grinding to a sudden halt again.Vertigo was written by Alfred Hitchcock and released in theatres in 1958. The film is regarded as a classic and commonly seen as some of Hitchcock's best work, and honestly, after watching I can understand how people where able to come to this conclusion. The majority of the main cast is excellent, but the standout actor for me was certainly James Stewart plays our main character, John Ferguson, who deserves a large amount of praise for how convincingly he played his role throughout the film, as he changes from a sympathetic protagonist into a rather obsessive crazy psychopath driven by his grief throughout the film.The film overall has a very strong plot with numerous unpredictable twists throughout that I would not even dare spoil. However in many ways the movie's age shows. Nowhere is this clearer than in the dated special effects in the film and the incredibly cheesy soundtrack that many of the older Hitchcock films are known for. Personally I do not have a problem either of these, as I find these aspects add to the classic feeling of the film; however, I can see it putting off some potential viewers.The only problem I had with the film was, as I mentioned above, is the films pacing. The film starts incredibly slow and is rather boring for the first thirty minutes before it begins picking up pace, however it then grinds to a second halt later on after the courtroom scene for another half hour before it finally picks up again for the climax of the film. While I can certainly forgive this in some ways, since the film is very entertaining when it is going at a decent pace, I still felt that it was quite jarring at several points during the movie.Overall I did enjoy Vertigo lot despite some issues I had with the pacing, but even with that issue I still feel that the film is a very entertaining watch, due to its unpredictable plot and the strong performances delivered by the lead actors. It is due to this that I am willing to rate Vertigo as an 8/10.",Vertigo
819,ZoeHewitson,Overall I enjoyed the film more than I expected,5,18 September 2013,"Overall I enjoyed the film more than I expected-as I'm not the biggest fan of old movies- But not a great deal. I was rather confused throughout most the film. I did however like the story near more the beginning; the mystery around the whole madeleine character was rather intriguing, especially when the hotel housekeeper said she had not visited her room. I also liked how the audience saw the story threw Scotties eyes, not knowing about Judy until the flashback revealing everything. However I lost interest greatly when the flashback was shown as it answered the mystery of what was happening/happened to Madeleine (personally I would have kept the flashback till Scotty takes Judy to the tower) I think the Characters are a little boring, it took me a while to because interested and invested in the character, it did weird me out a bit when Scottie went a bit phyco and abusive towards Judy as he didn't seem to be that type of character up to that point. For the time it was made in I think the production values are very good, the only thing I thought was bad was whenever someone fell, it looked so bad but I could cope with it. I don't really think I would personally recommend it to my friends as it's not really a film they would be interested in. Nor do I think it's a film that really sticks out as memorable. For me personally I would not rate this in my top list of films. I would not class it in the worst films I've ever seen. It would probably be somewhere in the lower middle quarter. My main issue was it took too long to get into the main story line. I also don't understand why the nun scarred Judy so much, that was actually a little unrealistic. Although then again when I watched this alone I did get scared, but I mean if someone else was there I would not go slip off a building.",Vertigo

I would recommend it to a friend but only as a solid film and not 'a timeless classic' as it is often called.The ending of the film is certainly very striking and memorable and was a well done climax after a pretty average build up. The music used really adds to shock value of the ending.The characters in this film are what let's this film down the most. Most of the acting is wooden and not believable whatsoever. James Stewart is hopeless as the lead character and really drags the film down with a performance that could send anyone to sleep. Other supporting actors are 'ok' but none will leave you amazed and none are memorable bar the one saving grace in the cast Kim Novak; She is fantastic in her dual roles as Madeline and Judy and her performance will grip you and added to the feelings of shock and sadness I felt at the ending.Hitchcock is superb as Director as always. The way the film is made; from every camera angle to every sound you hear creates suspense and anticipation. The build-up to the climax is done very well and the climax itself executed to a good standard.Though well-made it is not 'perfect' and the first part of the film probably over did it when trying to create suspense and was in all honestly, a bit boring. If the pacing to the first half was altered slightly and Stewart had put a little more effort in this could have been near perfect.",Vertigo

Now however, 55 years later, it lacks the lovable endeavour it was once looked upon by. Sure, Alfred Hitchcock does what he does best in this film (and I am in no way disputing his directing talents) and full appreciation must go towards him for the visual effects and the way he uses filming techniques to show Scottie's confusement. Credit must also go to James Stewart as Scottie who seemed to be the only thing worth watching about this film. That, however is I'm afraid all the positives that can be said about this film. The first part of the movie drags with little happening and the rest of the film fails to pick up from there. Sure in 1958 this movie was full of suspense and thought provoking cinema however in this era it just seems dull and lacks the suspense needed to make it enjoyable. The fact this film is called a 'suspense thriller' is almost laughable. The film seems to meander around shots of walking and driving and stalking for a good 40 minutes, something which when the film didn't start that great in the first place doesn't help its cause. The storyline was fairly obvious as well, even for a simpleton like me to guess, in addition to the dull as ditch water dialogue (even at the time) that's teemed with it. The directing as I've mentioned is not to blame and the use of colours and sound are brilliant by Hitchcock but that cannot make up for Vertigo which promised so much and produced so very little on the big screen. I would recommend this film to Hitchcock fans but it is by no means his best film, not even close. The lack of suspense and boring storyline despite the cleverness of Hitchcock means this film has to have 5 stars",Vertigo

To avoid spoilers, and make the movie sound interesting, a retired detective follows his lover all the way to death.

You are literally blindsided at the end due to a ""emotional shock"" episode.But, don't get too comfortable when you watch the movie. There are moments of high suspense with extreme darkness and extreme light. There are also odd moments of excitement. Even with these odd moments, the ending is very abrupt. Even with the alternative ending, it didn't seemed fully complete. According to Turner Classic Movies, Hitchcock was never fully satisfied with the script. Three different writers re-wrote the movie till Hitchcock was the least dissatisfied.Odd moments like Midge (Barbara Bel Geddes) leaving the psychiatric hospital talking to Scottie's (James Stewart) doctor and the ""off"" transition between her and the doctor was weird. After that, it was the last time we saw Midge. After Scottie left the hospital, it was never recognized again throughout the movie. Scottie's uncomfortably close watch of Madeline (Kim Novak.) Scottie's inquiries at Agory's Book Shop, the screen suddenly get dark, making you think the brightness on your device has had a lapse. Aside from scenes, looking at the film again, the foreshadowing is overwhelmingly obvious. Elster's (Tom Helmore) calm mode talking about his wife's, Madeline psychotic episodes, Madeline's whore-ish attitude toward Scottie, the cover of the film, and the unveiling of the deception two-thirds into the film.

It lacks the emotional resonance of ""Shadow of a Doubt,' the excitement of 'Strangers on a Train,' the fun of 'North by Northwest,' and the thrills of 'Psycho.'In essence, it is slow-moving and occasionally dull. James Stewart, who has a sort of vulnerability in his facial expressions - a childlike innocence, is perfectly cast as a mentally unstable man whose life is overtaken by his obsession with a dead lover. Near the second half of the film, his eyes speak louder than actions or words. However, there is a lack of chemistry between him and the lovely Kim Novak, who plays a Marilyn Monroe-like character with more charm than Monroe could ever pull off. It's as if the actors realize how silly the plot really is. The romantic interest which holds the film together is quite dull. It is nearly impossible to believe in the love that exists between Judy (Novak) and John (Stewart). Further, the acrophobia of John is interesting and exemplifies a theme of vulnerability. John is crippled by past trauma, and the signature dolly zoom sure shows it. Even Hermann's score, sounds like an object falling slowly with a decrescendo near the end sparked by dramatic riff. A film so heavily reliant on emotion and love could have provided the audience with some catharsis. 'Vertigo' has great performances, kinetic camera work, a disturbing score; all these pieces ultimately fail to connect.",Vertigo

Vertigo is more than a brilliant suspense film; at its heart it is a story about obsession and the struggle to let go.James Stewart gives one of the great performances in the history of cinema with his dark portrayal of Scottie, an obsessed detective with a fear of heights. Kim Novak is also excellent as Madeleine, the woman at the center of Scottie's obsession. Hitchcock, with his pristine craft, utilizes his directorial abilities by using camera-techniques, fog filters, beautiful and rich colors, mirrors, and Bernard Herrmann's haunting musical score to help the audience journey into the mind of Scottie as well as to accentuate Scottie's journey into the depths of his obsession.Vertigo is one of the greatest films ever made and it is the ultimate testament to Hitchcock's brilliance.",Vertigo

Not too many movies can envelop the watcher in a dizzying array of emotions the way Vertigo can. Loss and obsession, peppered with stretches of unrestrained bliss come to mind. But aside from the carefully woven plot line, its the little nuances of this film that really grab hold of you.There is much debate between this film and Rear window as to which film is visually superior. What makes rear window stunning is the camera work and the set of course. But rear window is confined to a single set, and makes the possibilities limited. Which leads to my point. Vertigo's cinematography is beautiful enough to entice even the most icy of viewers. This film invokes more emotion than any other film I've seen before - and this cannot be attributed entirely to the plot line, but the visual style with which it was filmed. From the sweeping camera over San Francisco, to Kim Novak's face against the red plush background of Ernie's interior, to the overhead shot of the stairs and hallway in the hotel, to the ethereal shot of the Golden Gate bridge, the placements and angles of the camera are flawless. Obviously Hitchcocks visions came alive in this one.",Vertigo

You play the film, expect nothing, and it's masterpiece! Alfred kept us during the film in suspense, expectations, and of course many questions. But in the end, Hitchcock answered all of (at least my) questions, and completed my expectations. What's so special about this film? It does make sense, it makes you ask yourself questions or create combinations why this happened, and so on. Definitely worth watching, even because of it's length - 2 hours 8 minutes 26 seconds.

The wonderful icing on the proverbial cake is, of course, the beautiful, touching, and haunting music by Bernard Herrmann. This melancholy soundtrack brings my favorite movie to completion. I only have two small wishes about this film to make it better in my eyes, that the shot which pans up to show the outside of the court room hearing was better done and that the shot of the pillow hitting the ground when Scottie asks Madeleine to sit by the fire was repeated when Scottie does the same thing with Judy.

It opens as Scottie Ferguson (James Stewart) realizes he has vertigo, a condition resulting in a fear of heights, when a police officer is killed trying to rescue him from falling off a building. Scottie then retires from his position as a private investigator, only to be lured into another case by his old college friend, Gavin Elster (Tom Helmore). Elster's wife, Madeleine (Kim Novak), has been possessed by a spirit, and Elster wants Scottie to follow her. He hesitantly agrees, and thus begins the film's wordless montage as Scottie follows the beautiful yet enigmatic Madeleine through 1950s San Francisco (accompanied by Bernard Herrmann's hypnotic score). After saving her from suicide, Scottie begins to fall in love with her, and she appears to feel the same way. Here tragedy strikes, and each twist in the movie's second half changes our preconceptions about the characters and events.

He was so close here to doing what he never actually ventured to do: create his own reality with film. Hitchcock is probably the greatest of the directors whose films always existed within what, for lack of a truly good term, we may call 'familiar reality' or 'objective reality'. With Vertigo, if he had done just a few things differently, it could have transcended this - he could have made a film that challenged our notions of reality, instead of abiding by its laws. He could have made his only truly 'surreal' film; as it is, its just a romance woven around a complex scam. I shouldn't say 'just'; after all, this is one of the greatest films of its era. There's no denying that Hitchcock was a genius of film-making (and I don't use the term 'genius' loosely); but with this film, he was just a step away from being one of cinema's greatest visionaries as well.",Vertigo

I might say parenthetically that it is one of the greatest ""tragedies"" to ever come out of Hollywood, that Hitchcock never actually won an Academy Award for Best Director!!Listen, does anyone out there know if Hitch had his usual brief cameo appearance at the start of the movie Vertigo or not, something he became well known for doing in some of his movies? Well, to sum up then, Vertigo will forever remain at the top of my personal 5-star movie list. If there is anyone who doesn't think that it was a great movie I would like to hear from them.",Vertigo
832,jrw-55914,The Best Film Ever Made? Perhaps.,10,17 July 2015,"Heart-wrenching. Soul-crushing. Horrifying. Depressing. Beautiful. Prosaic. Phenomenal. When describing Vertigo, all of these words come to mind. I warn you now--if you're reading this review (even though I have marked it as spoiler-laden) and you haven't seen the film, you must stop now. You will deprive yourself of the cinematic experience of a lifetime. Like Psycho, there is one vital piece of information that makes seeing the film for the first time a different kind of experience than you'll usually get from a film--an experience that you can only have once. So please, go watch the film if you haven't already. I'm not going anywhere.The premise is somewhat well-known. Jimmy Stewart plays a retired officer--who retired due to his acrophobia leading to the death of a colleague--and is now being pulled out of retirement to do an acquaintance of his a favor. His ""friend"" Gavin Elster believes his wife to be possessed by the spirit of a dead woman named Carlotta. He wants Scottie (Jimmy Stewart) to follow her, and make sure she's safe. Stewart foolishly agrees, and sets off by following her and tracking her to the various places of which she roams. Eventually, she commits suicide by throwing herself into the San Fransisco bay, and Scottie saves her. From there, the relationship kick-starts. There are some really great moments between the two--most notably at the Sequoia trees, and later at mission San Juan Bautista. It's clear that they love each other--even though they shouldn't. She's married! This is an affair and it's clearly not supposed to happen this way. Well, it seems as if Madeleine grows to understand that. Just before she goes off to jump from the tower, she tells him ""It wasn't supposed to happen this way."" A two-folded comment that only really makes sense upon re-watching. She climbs to the top of the tower and because of his acrophobia, he can't save her. She jumps. She dies. He's defeated.This is where most films would end. But no, this is just the beginning. Hitchcock is just laying out the scene. The real story is just beginning. After Scottie is finally out of the catatonic state the traumatic experience put him in, he meets a girl in town named Judy. He's attracted because she looks like Madeleine. He doesn't even deny it. And, strangely, Judy seems to know from the beginning--and, even more strangely, almost doesn't care.The plot thickens when what seems strange all finally makes sense. This is the major turning point. When Madeleine said ""It wasn't supposed to happen this way,"" she clearly meant that she and Scottie were not supposed to fall in love. But it almost makes it sound as if the rest of their activities had been planned. That's when the real layers begin to be peeled back. Judy writes a letter to Scottie, detailing Gavin Elster's original plans to kill Madeleine, how she was involved, and how the woman he loved really was still alive--but in the form of Judy, not Madeleine. Judy rips up the letter, though, and engages in a love life with Scottie. Scottie, however, still wants Madeleine--not Judy. And he'll do anything to get her. He forces her to basically become exactly the same way she was when she was Madeleine. He becomes passionate over it, and they fight. But Judy, desperate for Scottie's love, concedes to become Madeleine if it means garnering his love. One night, after her final transformation, she wears the necklace of Carlotta. Why? It's debated amongst film circles. Either she wasn't thinking, assumed he had forgotten, or--in my opinion--wanted to be found out and this was her way of doing it. The silent drive back to the mission that follows implies that she knew what was about to happen. He takes her back up the stairs so he can ""save her"" this time. He conquers his acrophobia. But then, he demands answers from her, and her she begins to answer both from her real persona and her assumed one. They reach the top, bicker, and something bizarre happens. They're standing dangerously close to the edge, and then there is a shot of a shadow approaching. We're clearly seeing this from the point of view of either Scottie or Judy, but no one really knows which. It's been argued that Judy sees it, is startled because she thinks it is the ghost of Madeleine or Carlotta, and falls to her death. On the contrary, some believe it to be a mere distraction to Scottie, allowing Madeleine to commit suicide. The last shot of the film shows Scottie standing, much like he did in his dream, looking down at her body. The film ends there. Did he jump? Did he kill himself to be with her? No one knows. The last twenty minutes or so is an emotionally frustrating experience. You want her to own up to it so much, but you also want him to be understanding. You see him become mad with trying to change her and become the same vain man that was out to kill his wife. When the tragedy happens, it hurts profusely--but it also hurts in a way that has never felt so good. You're clamoring for more at the end.I don't know what else to say other than this is possibly the best film ever made. AFI and BFI agree, as they both list it amongst their best. I am not qualified to say whether it's the best film or not, but I can say with complete sureness that it's my favorite film of all time-- with no real competition. Please, even if you did just spoil yourself--if you haven't seen it yet, go watch it. Right now. 10/10. Highly recommended to everyone.",Vertigo
833,blevin-31509,Ending is amazing,6,10 December 2020,"The ending of the film is certainly very striking and memorable and was a well done climax after a pretty average build up. The music used really adds to shock value of the ending.The characters in this film are what let's this film down the most. Most of the acting is wooden and not believable whatsoever. James Stewart is hopeless as the lead character and really drags the film down with a performance that could send anyone to sleep. Other supporting actors are 'ok' but none will leave you amazed and none are memorable bar the one saving grace in the cast Kim Novak; She is fantastic in her dual roles as Madeline and Judy and her performance will grip you and added to the feelings of shock and sadness I felt at the ending.Hitchcock is superb as Director as always. The way the film is made; from every camera angle to every sound you hear creates suspense and anticipation. The build-up to the climax is done very well and the climax itself executed to a good standard.Though well-made it is not 'perfect' and the first part of the film probably over did it when trying to create suspense and was in all honestly, a bit boring. If the pacing to the first half was altered slightly and Stewart had put a little more effort in this could have been near perfect.",Vertigo

836,ichthus-4,"Old-fashioned detective drama, beautifully executed",10,11 March 2006,"Beautiful is the word for this film because of the love that the camera lens has for its subject (like colour postcards of San Francisco from the 1950s), and for the haunting, melancholy score that Bernard Hermann composed. A sense of loss pervades this film, far beyond the loss experienced on multiple levels by the main character; there is a sense of the loss of a civilization, too. The methodical driving scenes around the city streets, the intent viewing in an art gallery, the appreciation for California history--these reaffirm emotionally for the viewer what the intellect already knew: The world of 'Vertigo' no longer exists. Nor does the Hollywood that gave us 'Vertigo' exist. Gently-paced, subtle storytelling has little appeal to the Ritalin generation with its incessant demand for action; the job of the filmmaker changed, somewhere along the way, from ""telling a story"" to ""providing an alternate reality."" But this was Hitchcock the storyteller at his finest, and his attempts at special effects, although commendable for their time, might distract those whose souls have been addicted to eye candy. In other words, if you're under 50, you just may not get it. The one disappointment I had with this film was the performance of Kim Novak; admittedly, trying to fill the shoes of Grace Kelly set an impossible standard for her to live up to. Supporting actress Barbara Bel Geddes, on the other hand, captured the frustration of being No. 3 in ""three's a crowd"" perfectly.",Vertigo

To be honest, I didn't know much about films before completing my film production degree, but Hitchcock's works are the cornerstone for me to explore the deeper meaning of all aspects. From the narrative perspective, the suspense built up in such a natural but thrilling way, the twist in the middle is brilliant. From the visual standpoint, a creative feature is a colour representing a particular meaning, the more times I watch, the more I appreciate this brilliant masterpiece. It's worth learning.",Vertigo
839,AryanMZ13,"Massoud Farassati's Review on Alfred Hitchcock's ""Vertigo""",10,4 August 2021,"What follows is a transcript of Massoud Farassati's speech on the Classic Cinema program, which critiques Alfred Hitchcock's ""Vertigo"".""Vertigo"" is a film that's less than all of Hitchcock's films, entertainment, and most of all Hitchcock's films, art. Vertigo I think is the best Hitchcock film and the best film in the history of cinema.To get Vertigo, I think we have to start with the credits. The film's subtitle is a wonderful artistic short film that compresses Vertigo. Extreme Close-up view by Kim Novak. The first half of the face, then, slowly, the whole face that rests on the eye, the wandering eyes that look to the left, and to the right; They seem to be afraid of something. The names of the actors, Kim Novak and James Stewart, follow. The camera zooms in slowly to the right of the frame, changes color, and blushes, and the word ""VERTIGO"" appears inside the eye. Slowly we go into the eye and spiral-shaped and spring circles appear inside the eye. These Circles Work And it even reaches the fetus and, somehow Graphic images of human birth. Again, it turns to her face and says Alfred Hitchcock's Vertigo.This short film (the unique titration of Saul Bass, with the special and wonderful music of Bernard Herrmann, which is a tension with a romantic melody) will always be remembered.The film begins quickly after the credits. The first view is a bar and the hand holding the bars; A bar that cuts the horizon and completely covers the frame (two-thirds bottom is empty and one-third is top); The hand that takes the bars and James Stewart. Three people are running on the roof. An element dressed in white, a policeman, and a Shapu hat man we later find out are detectives. Hitchcock has whitewashed the criminal in the dark. (This is very unrealistic, but I think it's completely Hitchcock. Hitchcock's logic is beyond realism, and it's its own logic.) We see the police and James Stewart, who is unable to walk on the roof. ""Give me your hand,"" the police tells him. The police, taking James Stewart by the hand, jump from top to bottom, and James Stewart hangs up. This is a movie poster. This is the largest and most enduring cinematic photograph of a man who is hung, suspended, and terrified: James Stuart.After the police fall, we have Hitchcock's first extraordinary technical work. That is, a dolly forward and zoom backward movement that combines this back and forth motion creates Vertigo, and from here with this technique (which goes beyond this technique and reaches the form of a film) we encounter the structure of vertigo.This short film (the second Vertigo short film after the credits) is cut (a cut, I think again, a cartoon, similar to the cut from North by Northwest). Someone is hanging from a roof (between earth and sky). . . Cut goes to Scotty's fiancé (James Stewart). Hitchcock is asked how this man came down and went inside this house? ""From the emergency stairs,"" Hitchcock replies. He is joking.What is this Cut? I think a cut is completely cartoonish. A fantasy cut that only makes sense in the world of Hitchcock. Katie is actually coming out of a nightmare. I think this short film (Running on the Roof) is a recurring Scotty nightmare, and that's why this Cut (now, at Meg, her fiancé's house) is a cartoon. This is one of the points that I think needed to be reminded of.Scotty retires and wanders; According to him, his job is Wandering. It comes down to a subject and the subject who is his friend's wife: Madeleine. He is supposed to watch out for Madeleine because she wants to die. In this quest, we drive into the city of San Francisco in a Scotty car and drive around the city in a Scotty. A very special city that is very suitable for this film. We are slowly moving from a real-world to a fantasy world. We see Madeleine coming to buy flowers. Scotty parks his car nearby and enters a dungeon where he sees a florist when he opens a door. When that door opens (which we see slowly opening the door), it is as if we are facing a strange, unreal place, and a paradise; The florist, from behind the crypt, looks like this.This is Scotty's look at Madeleine. That is, it is as if Scott, with Hitchcock's Subjective Camera, creates a volatile, imaginary, and exemplary being. Madeleine is both a real and an imaginary being; Scotty's fantasy of a love affair with a woman who desperately wants to die from the beginning and is intensely demanding of death, and that is why Scotty was hired. Hitchcock's Vertigo is the explanation of this reality and fantasy, and going from reality to fantasy, staying in that fantasy, and reaching love, and losing love.Madeleine is killed by her husband. It is thrown from the top of the tower and destroyed. Scotty falls ill and is admitted to a mental hospital, and when he comes out, he does not let go of his fantasy world again. When he comes out, he wanders the streets and finds a woman like Madeleine. He approaches her, communicates with her, imposes himself on her and. . . Gradually he turns the woman into Madeleine. She changes her clothes and puts on Madeleine clothes: a gray coat and skirt (neutral color). A particular type of hairstyle that is circular, and these circles (hair-tying circle, titration circle, Hitchcock camera technical movement) together create a circular structure for Vertigo, with both the subject and the subject. It has a ""co-story"" with the content. This film, thus, has the same theme, form, and content, it is all Vertigo.The last moment of Scotty's creation (turning Judy into Madeleine) is the moment he takes her and puts Madeleine's clothes on her but she still resists her hairdo. When the haircut is over, the creature is completely created. A completely imaginary creature. Scotty fantasizes about love and the lost Madeleine.Before we get to this complete creation of Scotty (ie, the re-creation of Madeleine or the imaginary creation of Madeleine), it is good to point out a few scenes that I think need an explanation to understand the film.In one of the chases, Madeleine enters a second-class hotel and goes upstairs. Scotty sees him, who has opened the window, from inside the street. Scotty enters the hotel and searches. There an old maid (an old woman) confirms that Madeleine lives here but is no longer present. Then Scotty goes up and sees that no one is in the room. This scene, I think, is very key. But there are elements of reality like the hotel where Madeleine sometimes lives (she comes during the day, sleeps at night, and leaves). Another key scene in the cemetery scene where Madeleine comes and fills flowers on a grave; Grandmother's grave. Let me also mention the museum, the museum where the grandmother's photo is there, and it has the same type of a hairdo, and the camera zooms in on it and compares it to Madeleine's hairdo.Madeleine seems to have been buried with the death of her grandmother. (Now, Hitchcock also tells a story to her grandmother that we hear in the film.) It is as if Madeleine is possessed by her grandmother and that is why death is near and she seeks death. Even the moment she falls in love with Scotty, in that forest, seeing those trees, she declares that she likes to go and sees the image of his own grave. This mortal says from the beginning that the love that Scotty has created, such an imagination and such an ethereal example, is not lasting and death is over his head.After Scotty turns Judy into Madeleine, there's a weird look. Scotty Nesse, Judy comes out of the bathroom door. With the same Madeleine dress and hairstyle that looks exactly like Madeleine. . . It has become him. The lighting around the door creates a look that is neither realistic nor surreal. It is a strange view of Hitchcock. According to Scotty's back, the light is green and the letter P is a sign of Paradise. The name of the hotel they are in is Empire but we only see it. It's like Scotty's paradise here.The woman who comes out (with the same calm and Madeleine steps) blurs the image around the door and flows there and lights it as if it comes from another world. From an unreal world. From a completely imaginary world.This is a Scotty creation, and Vertigo is an artistic creation. Its subject is creation. Look, see, and create. Its subject is cinema. The subject is the image and. . . Its subject is the creation of art and the sufferings of this creation.After Madeleine is created through Scotty, she must go through the same process as the previous Madeleine. Scotty brings him back to the church: the same stairs again, the same stairs he could not climb for fear of heights. Now, this time, he slowly ascends with Madeleine, and the fear of his height is healed here.Reaches the top of the church. Madeleine, once frightened by the nun, is thrown down once more and dies. Scotty, it's standing up. Between earth and sky. His hands are open. There is no way back and no way to die. It is as if it must forever oscillate between life and death, up there and in suspension. And this is the end of the first suspension of the film that hung from the gutter.The film transforms the suspension from a cinematic formal work into an ontological suspension, and Scotty remains in perpetual suspension. This scene will be remembered forever, and in my opinion, there is no place and no film by Hitchcock that has been able to express the suspension with such precision and with this serious philosophical burden, and this is the culmination of the art of cinema. It is the peak of looking at cinema. Is the peak of creation and. . . The climax is a deeply lasting bitter film.Score: 4/4.",Vertigo

My obsessions were cultivated later.The setting, San Francisco at its prime, with its hills and sharp light contrasts because of the surrounding waters add to the ever changing but hypnotic backdrop of this color film. Even Bernard Herrmann's music score emphasis the mood swings of its characters to pull the viewer into its vortex.Vertigo is a dizzying production of dark and light, ups and downs. It is the story of one man's obsessions for controlling his surroundings and desires to a point where his life is spinning out of control. Or is it? It has been written that Hitchcock in real life was controlling and manipulative (""All actors should be treated like cattle"") and why all the blonde, austere, frigid women? So, plot, acting, direction, photography and music are all mingled to give the viewer a wonderful, mesmerizing, voyeuristic look into obsessive behavior.
