0,MartinHafer,"Apart from a few bits, a complete disaster.",2,20 April 2020,"I must point out first that I have seen ""Cats"" on Broadway...and I was NOT a fan. I found the story bizarre and didn't particularly enjoy the play. So, consider this when you read the review.As to the movie, it is one of the biggest disasters in recent box office memory, as the film was pretty much hated by everyone...including fans of the play. And, after seeing it, I can see why. Apart from a song here and there and the train dance number, pretty much everything about the film is terrible...especially its waste of talented and expensive stars. Many times, established stars are given songs that simply aren't good fits for their skills. The biggest example that comes to mind is Rebel Wilson....who I loved singing in other movies. Here, she just isn't that good...and it just goes to show you talented and likable stars are not going to work if the producers are out of their minds. A few other things I disliked about the film would include the creepiness of the characters, generally bad CGI (the opening scene shocked me how rotten it looked), Idris Elba looking naked (and super-creepy) towards the end of the film as well as the really creepy and awful cockroach scene.The bottom line is that this film was a chore to finish....and I found myself asking my family if they really wanted to finish the movie! It lacks fun, quality and a sound reason for being made in the first place. This film simply needs to be put to sleep.",Cats
1,SnoopyStyle,the horror... the horror,2,7 January 2021,"There has been an apocalypse. Mostly a cat-human hybrid seems to be thriving in the streets of London. They cultivate cockroaches for food and are obsessed with their own names as they sing and dance.Sometimes their faces look weird somehow. It's not all the time. In fact, it's only once in awhile but I'm fixated with the problem. Their human faces don't always match their bodies. Even when it's done perfectly, it's inhuman. I'm going to say the obvious. The CGI is unnecessary. They are better off using make-up and wear leotards. If they're using CGI, I don't understand why they kept the boobs. They need to get rid of the human boobs. Leaving all that aside, I stopped caring about the story. I don't know the point of the story. It suffers the greatest sin of any story. It's boring. More than the weird cat-human hybrid or the dancing cockroaches or the horrible jokes, this is boring.",Cats
2,kosmasp,Look what the cat dragged in,2,30 September 2021,"The movie started with quite a good song ... a song that made me feel good. Made me not think about the ... I'm not sure there is a safe word I can use for this mixture of cats and humans. Having said that, I am not knocking anyone off who might find this enticing. I'm not even telling that someone they should seek help ... actually all kidding aside, who knows how individuals may feel in hundreds of years ... they may mingle with DNA and clones so much, that something like what we see here becomes reality ... afraid yet? Maybe you should be, but remember: you'll probably won't be alive to see it, so there is that.Really good actors involved in this and after that initial song ... the movie drags on (no pun intended I think, but I'm not quite sure). Puns and ""jokes"" like the one I used as summary are being used by the movie too. I have not seen the musical .. and I do think that some songs are not really bad ... but this movie ... I really don't know how anyone thought this was a good idea ... the money they spent on this ... inconceivable (to use another movies famous quote).I'm fairly certain they only had the best of intentions and if you were actually able to enjoy this ... good for you. Really, not being sarcastic. But if you haven't watched it yet ... well if you are not a glutton for punishment like I am, you probably will stop watching after 10-20 minutes ... you have been warned. This is not Schrodingers cat ... the cat is out of the box.",Cats
3,Sleepin_Dragon,I even gave Carry on Emmanuelle 2/10,1,22 December 2019,"I never ever give a 1 star rating, having crawled out of the cinema after this monstrosity I had to give it the review it deserves. I genuinely thought I had a migraine as the screen seemed out of focus and distorted, everyone else said the same. A hideous movie, the visuals detracted from the music, which was half decent, some of the performances were dire. I hate to jump on the bandwagon, but the worst movie of 2019.Excruciating. 1/10",Cats
4,jboothmillard,Cats,3,12 January 2020,"There was so much backlash and negativity surrounding this star-studded movie, based on the popular stage musical from Lord Sir Andrew Lloyd Webber, when the trailer was released, mainly because of the nightmarish CGI effects, plot and tone. Having watched the 1998 straight-to-video release, I was most interested to compare it to the regular costume/makeup stage version, or just to see how bad it really was. Based on the poetry collection Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats by T. S. Eliot, from Razzie winning director Tom Hooper (The King's Speech, Les Misérables, The Danish Girl). Basically, young white Victoria (introducing Razzie nominated Francesca Hayward) is dropped in the streets of London by her owner in the middle of the night. Alley cats surround her, introducing themselves as the ""Jellicles"" (""Jellicle Songs for Jellicle Cats""). Among the cats are shy magician Mr. Mistoffelees (Laurie Davidson) who develops a crush on Victoria, the loyal Munkustrap (Robbie Fairchild), snooty queens Cassandra (Mette Towley) and Demeter (Daniela Norman). The cats take Victoria under their wing, telling how the different cats are named (""The Naming of Cats""), and the hype surrounding the Jellicle Ball (""The Invitation to the Jellicle Ball""), an annual ceremony where cats compete for the ""Jellicle choice"", the chance to go to the Heaviside Layer (presumably like Heaven) to be granted a new life. One by one, the competitors are introduced and express their contributions to the community. Large domestic tabby cat Jennyanydots (Razzie winning Rebel Wilson) (""The Old Gumbie Cat"") teaches mice and cockroaches various activities. The Rum Tum Tugger (singer Jason Derulo) (""The Rum Tum Tugger"") is a flirtatious tom cat who riles up the others doing whatever he wants. Gentleman cat Bustopher Jones (Razzie winning James Corden) (""Bustopher Jones: The Cat About Town"") boasts about his weight and shares his garbage scraps, he wishes to become thin again in his new life. Skimbleshanks (Steven McRae), a tidy ginger cat who is unofficially in charge of the railway (""Skimbleshanks: The Railway Cat""). Elderly threatre cat Gus (Sir Ian McKellen) - short for Asparagus - tells about some of the biggest roles in history (""Gus: The Theatre Cat""). Also lingering about London, scaring all other cats, is the villainous stray Macavity (Idris Elba) who kidnaps some of the contestants to be made the Jellicle Choice by default. Victoria also happens to meet the mischievous twins Mungojerrie (Danny Collins) and Rumpleteazer (Naoimh Morgan) who enjoy causing trouble and messing with things in human homes (""Mungojerrie and Rumpleteazer""). Mr. Mistoffelees comes to rescue Victoria, when the twins leave her tangled up. They return to the group, just in time to see the arrival of the tribe's wise and beloved matriarch Old Deuteronomy (Razzie nominated Dame Judi Dench) (""Old Deuteronomy""). The Jellicle Ball commences inside the abandoned Egyptian Theatre (""The Jellicle Ball""). Victoria is welcomed and dances a ballet solo in the moonlight. But she is distracted by Cassandra harassing Grizabella (Jennifer Hudson), a former member of the tribe who was banished. Victoria relates to Grizabella's feelings of abandonment (""Beautiful Ghosts""). Old Deuteronomy witnesses the interaction between them and assures Victoria that she can become a Jellicle herself in time. The Ball is interrupted by femme fatale Bombalurina (singer Taylor Swift), who performs a song and dance number dedicated to Macavity (""Macavity: The Mystery Cat""): a distraction to incapacitate the party. Macavity arrives, demanding to be made the Jellicle Choice. Old Deuteronomy refuses to do so and is subsequently kidnapped and placed with Macavity's other victims. The Jellicles recuperate and are distraught over their leader's disappearance, Victoria suggests that Mr. Mistoffelees use his powers to conjure Old Deuteronomy back (""Magical Mr. Mistoffelees""). He tries a few times, eventually making Old Deuteronomy reappear. The cats rejoice and praise Mr. Mistoffeles; he and Victoria dance together and become mates. Meanwhile, Jennyanydots frees herself and the other cats kidnapped by Macavity. Grizabella returns to the Egyptian. Victoria shows her support and urges her to sing her true feelings. Grizabella proceeds to sing a passionate ballad about her mistakes, her former glory, and her beauty (""Memory""), she touches the hearts of the cats. Old Deuteronomy names Grizabella the Jellicle Choice and sends her off to the Heaviside Layer (""The Journey to the Heaviside Layer"") in a chandelier, floating like a hot air balloon. Macavity leaps onto a rope from the chandelier in a last attempt to reach the Heaviside Layer, but falls onto Nelson's Column. The Jellicles reunite, perched on a lion statue they watch Grizabella ascend as the morning sun rises. After the congregation disperses, Old Deutoronomy welcomes Victoria to the tribe and gives a closing speech to the audience (""The Ad-dressing of Cats""). Also starring Ray Winstone as Growltiger aka the Terror of the Thames, Freya Rowley as Jellylorum, Bluey Robinson as Alonzo. There are no complaints about greats like Dench and McKellen, and fantastic voices like Hudson and Swift, while newcomer Hayward is alright, Corden and Wilson aren't that great, Elba is too pantomime villain, and Derulo is annoying. The first half of the film is disturbing and dire, it gets only slightly bearable by the point Dench comes onscreen, with the more memorable, heartstring tugging and oh-so clever song and dance routines in the second half. The problem with the film is indeed the look and tone of it, it's almost too dark, and the CGI to make the actors furry un-feline like creatures is awful, costumes and painted faces like the original stage show would have been better. It isn't the most awful thing I've ever seen, but it's certainly not one of the best, no wonder it flopped at the box office, a disappointing musical fantasy. It won the Razzies for Worst Picture, Worst Screenplay, and Worst Screen Combo for Any two half-feline/half-human hairballs, and it was nominated for Worst Screen Combo for Jason Derulo & His CGI-Neutered ""Bulge"", and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Original Song for ""Beautiful Ghosts"". Adequate!",Cats
5,BA_Harrison,I'd have hated to have paid cash to see this.,2,20 December 2019,"Cats is way out of my comfort zone: I'm not a fan of West End musicals, I can't stand James Corden (and struggle with Rebel Wilson), and the idea of Judi Dench singing is the stuff of nightmares. However, the lure of seeing something truly terrible and then being able to write a scathing review proved too irresistible; to that end, I wasn't disappointed (plus, the viewing was free for me: I won an Unlimited cinema pass earlier in the year).Imagine all of the roller-skating locomotives of Starlight Express speeding down their ramps and flying off the stage in unison, landing in a crumpled heap in the front row, arms and legs twisted and broken: Cats is an even bigger train wreck than that. Putting aside the frankly bizarre sight of well-known performers with CG cat ears, fur and tails, the film is still 100 minutes of 'what were they thinking?' with a sprinkling of 'who the hell likes this stuff?'.A nonsensical plot (based on T.S. Eliot's 1939 anthology, Old Possum's Book Of Practical Cats) strings together the baffling musical numbers, of which there are many. The word 'jellicle' gets said an awful lot, but no-one explains what it means. It's not unlike a wild fever dream, with bizarre imagery, strange performances and lacklustre song and dance routines pummelling the senses until the final act, in which Jennifer Hudson's snivelling, runny-nosed Grizabella screeches her rendition of Memory (more painful than a cat making itself comfy on your lap) before disappearing into the sky in a chandelier suspended from a hot air balloon.James Corden is as unbearably irritating as I had imagined and watching Rebel Wilson effectively naked except for a layer of fur is hard to take. On the flipside, Taylor Swift as Bombalurina is hot despite her all-over hair, and easily the highlight of the whole sorry mess.2/10 for Taylor Swift, but I almost deducted a point for the mice and cockroaches. Human-like felines are a stretch; anthropomorphic rodents and insects are a step too far.",Cats
6,BandSAboutMovies,"Salt the earth, nuke it from space, go back in time and stop their mothers",1,27 February 2020,"You know, this feels like fish in a barrel. And I debated this review literally being three words: CENSORED this movie.But then Rowhouse Theater - the single screen claustrophobic hipster cesspool that infamously had a strange PC moment before screening El Topo that still upsets me every time I think about it - decided to start showing this movie with live riffing from local hackster comedians and I said, ""I owe it to this movie to give it more effort than a bunch of millennial profiteers of mass culture and overpriced beer ever could.Yet at the end, as the lyrics reminded me that cats are not dogs, I wondered, was it all worth it? Of course it wasn't.You know who loves Cats? Warren Beatty, probably. After all, once his film Ishtar was the dictionary definition of a movie failing. Now - maybe not so much.The budget for this movie was around a hundred million and it made back around $73.5 million of that and it hasn't hit streaming and video yet. So perhaps the man who made his own Dick Tracy documentary - locking up the rights because he refuses to allow anyone else to play the role - shouldn't feel so good about himself just yet. This movie could, as yet, make money.Much like Exorcist II: The Heretic, this movie was continually re-edited while it was still in theaters. Now, today that's simple and doesn't require physical prints to be shipped to theaters. But that movie didn't have a cat with human hands and a wedding ring that needed to be fixed via CGI. That's more frightening than anyone screaming, ""Tell me your dream name!""Seriously, the animation houses and SFX guys made a mint on this movie, probably working triple overtime and getting holiday pay.Andrew Lloyd Webber's play was a big deal in the late 1970's. And sure, some plays are timeless. But this story - where numerous cats attend the Jellicle Ball, an annual ceremony where they compete for basically the chance to go to Heaven - isn't all that special to begin with. But see, I wonder when I make fun of it, I mean, I'm never going to write a play that stays on Broadway all these decades or convinces great actors to throw away any shred of dignity that they may have left. I'm just a man writing about Cats on my laptop in the early morning hours of a Sunday and trying to figure out why this film upset me so much.Have you ever got really drunk and party hopped and then ended up at a house you probably shouldn't have gone to? You might worry about the drinks or food that you've been handed, that you're going to dosed. And it might appear that the other guests are either going to batter or aarvark one another into submission - all while not caring that you're in attendance. You might end up dead. Or worse.That's the feeling that I had while watching this movie. Existential ennui, which is way worse than not just liking a movie. The feeling that yes, everything is wrong.James Corden and Rebel Wilson made fun of this movie at the Oscars, while at the same time having no issue cashing the paychecks they made from it. Corden reminds me of the 70's celebrities that SCTV would skewer with The Sammy Maudlin Show, but he has none of the charm or nostalgia value of the glad-handing celebs that once held court on Carson and game shows. Wilson deserves better and I worry with this role that she may not realize it.I do have to confess that I laughed like an absolute maniac during this movie, perhaps more than I have at any comedy I've watched this year. I usually stick to the old school Saturday Night Live rule that funny names are the lowest form of comedy, but there's a cat named Macavity the Mystery Cat. And a theater cat named Asparagus. And that role is played by Ian McKellen, making this his new career nadir - and that dude was in a bunch of boring movies where shrunken furry-footed men walked and walked and are still walking, somewhere still in the shire. Assuredly, the man would rather have his role of Death in The Last Action Hero on his resume than this.The cast got to attend a cat school to prepare themselves for this movie. One assumes that they learned how to defecate in boxes, lick themselves, randomly fall asleep and break everything important to everyone. That joke was written by one of my cats, who said that he's allowed to say that, seeing as how, you know, he's a cat. Also: I may be writing this review on a variety of substances over the counter, on the bar and under the radar.Here's some Cats trivia to see if you're paying attention: The story is based on T. S. Eliot's book Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats, which is also where most of Sir Peter Ustinov's dialogue as Old Man in Logan's Run comes from.I was doing just fine until the CGI people roaches and mice showed up. Now, I'm losing my marbles.After The King's Speech, director Tom Hooper was flying pretty high. Who knows where he goes from here? Does this movie have a second life of ironic jerks loving it in spite of itself? Probably. The same people who never watched a Korean movie in their lives but now are falling all over themselves to tell you about Parasite never miss a trick, you know.I mean, make no mistake. This is one of the worst - if not the worst - movies that you'll ever suffer through. I'm not going to romanticize this or tell you it's so bad it's good or say that people just don't understand. Seeing Taylor Swift warble on about ""Beautiful Ghosts"" or Dame Judi Dench dead staring into your eyes like some kidnap victim forced to beg for her life is like crawling on your knees across concrete as if you were on a pilgrimage to a Mexican holy place, except that there's no chance that God is going to hear your prayers or answer your pleas.You're the one who decided to watch this. And there's no whiff of the divine on the Thames tonight.",Cats
7,preppy-3,Call me crazy but I sort of liked it!,5,1 January 2020,"I HATED the musical on stage when I saw it in 1980. There was little plot, most of the songs sucked and I was bored. The movie has some of these issues but I ended up sort of liking it. The makeup on the people wasn't that bad and everybody could sing, act and dance. Also there was some startling set designs--it certainly LOOKED great! I almost did walk out about 30 minutes in when a number with singing mice and tap-dancing cockroaches (I'm not kidding) started up but I stayed. It got much better after that. Most of the songs were unmemorable but I loved ""Mr. Mistoffelees"" and (of course) ""Memory"". Also Jennifer Hudson was superb in her role. She sang ""Memory"" so beautifully I started crying. So it's not a great movie but it's certainly not the bomb people are saying it is.",Cats
8,CinemaSerf,Cat-astrophy!!,4,23 December 2019,"Ok, it's a-paw-ling; an abject lesson on how to squander 100 million dollars whilst simultaneously wrecking one of the best examples of musical theatre. There is little point in singling out any one contributor (there is no way this can be described as acting) though Sir Ian McKellen does appear to be in on the joke. It gets 4/10 because when the singing does actually kick-in, there is no disguising the quality of Andrew Lloyd Webber's original score; but please, please - let's never have an extended director's cut!?",Cats
9,ferguson-6,far from purr-fect,4,20 December 2019,"Greetings again from the darkness. Director Tom Hooper must really enjoy this process. In 2012 he brought mega-hit stage musical LES MISERABLES to the screen. It was nominated for 8 Oscars and won 3, including one for Anne Hathaway. This time, Mr. Hooper again turns his talents towards a colossally successful stage musical, and costumes, make-up, and visual effects are even more crucial. Whereas Les Mis was adapted from Victor Hugo's novel, CATS was adapted by songwriter Andrew Lloyd Webber from a 1939 poetry collection of T.S. Elilot. Of course, Mr. Webber is also the genius behind other brilliant musicals, including THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA (from the novel by Gaston Leroux).Tom Hooper and Lee Hall have adapted the screenplay from the stage presentation, and the sung-through musical approach means there is minimal dialogue. Songs are used to tell the story and introduce the key characters. Choreographer Andy Blankenbuehler (a 3-time Tony winner, ""Hamilton"") is the real star. Multiple dance styles are featured, including: classical ballet, contemporary, hip-hop, and traditional tap. The dancing is tremendous, and of course, a big part of that is Francesca Hayward, who plays new kitten on the block, Victoria. Ms. Hayward is a Principal Ballerina at The Royal Ballet. Numerous other skilled dancers are in the cast as well.The story (such that it is) revolves around a tribe of Jellicle cats who have an annual ritual of selecting one to ascend to the Heaviside Layer and come back with a new Jellicle life. Sweet Victoria is unceremoniously dumped in the alley by her owner, and is quickly surrounded by this tribe of cats that basically aren't very nice. It's in this opening sequence where we realize these humans as cats actually look a bit creepy and take a while to get accustomed to. Given the structure, the story plods along through each successive song, with certain characters getting their moment to shine. These include Rebel Wilson as humorous and chunky Gumbie cat Jennyanydots, Rum Tum Tiger cat played by talented musician/singer/dancer Jason Derulo, Oscar winner Jennifer Hudson as outcast Grizabella, James Corden as the usually-hungry Bustopher Jones, and Oscar winner Judi Dench as Old Deuteronomy. Always hovering, is the mystical Macavity played by glowing-green-eyed Idris Elba, and making a later appearance is Taylor Swift as Bombalurina, singing the Macavity tribute song.The two most memorable numbers come courtesy of Ian McKellan as Gus the Theatre Cat, and Ms. Hudson who belts out the most famous song of the production, ""Memory"", in a vocal and emotional highlight of the film. Visually, it's Mr. Mistofelees (Laurie Davidson) magic number that breaks us out of the muted palette. The other musical numbers mostly just fall flat and aren't very entertaining or enjoyable.It's pure coincidence that the screening for this film was the same day as the new Star Wars movie. The franchise for the latter began in 1977, while ""Cats"" first hit the stage in 1981. That's quite a legacy for both. As for this film version from director Hooper, I do wonder if enough viewers will respond to a musical where the story and songs are overshadowed by the dancing, and the sets and costumes offer no 'wow' factor. Many will find these characters hard to connect with ... at least outside of that incredible Jennifer Hudson vocal. It seems these kitties should have remained on stage.",Cats
10,morrison-dylan-fan,"Cats:The original CGI glitches Midnight Movie cut. So Bad,It's Good.",8,4 January 2020,"In the run-up to X-Mas I started reading reviews for Cats, the majority of which had a tone which suggested a special So Bad,It's Good movie. Just before Christmas,I read reports that in a weeks time Universal were going to permanently withdraw this current version, in order to bring out a ""improved CGI"" replacement edition. Realising this is likely the one chance to see the original cut,I went on Boxing Day to get the Cats out of the box on the big screen.View on the film:Stating in interviews at the premiere that he was still working on CGI sequences just hours before the screening, director Tom Hooper & cinematographer Christopher Ross cough up a $100 million (plus another $100 million for marketing) ""So Bad,It's Good"" grand furball folly. From the opening shot descending into the world of Cats, a utterly strange atmosphere wiggles on screen, shaking in the CGI proportions of the cats changing between shots,and even the CGI fur on the hands/faces of the cast re-appearing/disappearing from shot to shot (and they spent millions on this!)Having made Les Misérables (2012-also ) reviewed, Hooper gives the impression of unintentionally making a anti-Musical, where would-be decadent vast settings for the cats dancing on the streets of London, is melted by Hooper into appearing it's been dipped in tie-dye acid dripping colours down Hooper's distorted, weaving camera moves on dance movers,originally performed with a skillfulness by dancers, that is hilariously dented by Hooper placing ill-fitting CGI cats skeletons to copy the dance moves.Closing in with hand-held shots towards the I Dream A Dream-style set-piece with Memories, Hooper makes it come off as a unintended spoof,due to his regular composition of placing the performer into the far side of the screen, causing the fever dream vision of the half human/half animal CGI animals, (complete with human faced bugs,who get eaten!) to be sneezed into the melting backdrop.Clawing into Andrew Lloyd Webber's Musical adaptation of T.S. Eliot's poems already giving them the challenge that the stage version spends 90% on set-up/intros to the Cats, the screenplay by Hooper and lee Hall try in desperation to place new, additional tension over who will go to the Heaviside Layer, that gets in the way of the tail-shacking, joyfully nonsensical, disconnected to cat buglers (get it?!) old cat dames, and the railway cat who got the cream.",Cats
11,HotToastyRag,"Great visuals, lousy songs",5,23 February 2021,"As much improved as the Tom Hooper film adaptation of Cats is to the stage musical, there is one element that both have in common: the opening number is incredibly rousing and impressive, and the rest of the show falls short. ""Jellicle Cats"" is a toe-tapping number with great dancing, introducing the characters and the environment of the alley cats. It goes on and on, raising the audience's spirits and hopes - and then you hear the rest of the songs.Cats is basically a feline-version of A Chorus Line, with each cat coming forward with his or her own song and vignette that isn't tied to any other's. There is an underlying story, just as in A Chorus Line: one cat will be chosen to be the Jellicle Cat and sail off in a hot air balloon. No, it's never explained why cats have access to a hot air balloon, nor is it explained what in the world a Jellicle Cat actually is. The songs are forgettable, irritating, and sound as if the performers were ad-libbing their notes. They do not sound like they were written by an accomplished composer who wrote ""Music of the Night"" and ""Beneath a Moonless Sky"". The lyrics, taken from T.S. Eliot's poems, are more confusing than clever. Cats don't break into houses and steal things; they're afraid of confrontation. They also don't try to lure other cats to the ""dark side"" with addictive catnip.However, the special effects, costumes, makeup, and set designs are off-the-charts fantastic. A simple tap-dance number for the cat who hangs out at the train tracks gets transformed to an exciting traveling adventure. Cats tap on the rail, dance in the compartment, and sing into the beautiful London skyline. The tuxedo cat who performs magic tricks showers the chorus with rose petals and glitter. Tom Hooper did as much as was possible for him to do to improve the show. I don't know why he wanted to bring Cats to the big screen, though, since the songs are the main problem.Everyone in the cast tried very hard, and it was very cute to see Judi Dench with her puffy, fluffy fur as Old Deuteronomy. Jennifer Hudson was naturally given the show-stopping song, but her performance was very disappointing. Whether it was because she was forced to sing live (remember Les Miserables?) and would have benefited from the relaxed environment of a sound studio, or whether she's just lost her powerful voice from thirteen years ago, or whether she was just too emotionally involved in acting in front of the camera and couldn't sing at the same time (it is actually impossible to cry and sing at the same time), we'll never know. What we do know is she chose to cry during ""Memory"" instead of sing it, and because she was feeling it so intensely, the audience wasn't able to.Francesca Hayward got a teeny-tiny ""introducing"" credit at the end of the film, but since she was the lead, I don't know why she wasn't marketed and congratulated for her first film performance. Miss Hayward is a ballerina, and while it's breathtaking to watch her talent and form, her beautiful face certainly competes with the rest of her. Her sweet expressions were lovely to watch; it takes a rare actress to communicate for an hour with only her eyes before she even speaks or sings a word. I kept wondering, ""Who is this girl? Is it Taylor Swift? Has she finally grown into her looks?"" Taylor Swift, only appearing for one song, was repeatedly plugged for starring in this movie, and I thought it was because she played the lead role. Francesca was lovely, and I'd love to see more of her work.DLM Warning: If you suffer from vertigo or dizzy spells, like my mom does, this movie might not be your friend. During Rebel Wilson's number, the camera flips upside down to watch the beetles march, and when the bugs dance on the cake the camera swirls a la Busby Berkeley, and that will make you sick. In other words, ""Don't Look, Mom!""",Cats

All of our cats have individual personalities with names mostly derived from historic British sources.Great costuming; good CGI (wiggly ears/tail); exceptional range of dance skills (great choreography).

Even the big showstopper 'memoroes' sang by Jennifer Hudson doesn't hit the emotional notes like it should. The dance numbers were entertaining but I was frustrated everytime I was following a certain character, it would cut away to someone else.Taylor Swift is really not in the movie a lot, she really does not have a lot of screen time. She is the moll to Idris Elba's bad guy, turns up sings one song near the end and is then gone.Francesca Hayward plays the main character Victoria, and she is great as is the CGI, there is no faulting it looks great.I'm not sure this is going to be a big hit, a man in front of me audibly sighed several times, before leaving his wife/girlfriend to watch the rest of the movie, whilst some girls near me laughed a lot at it.",Cats

18,Thanos_Alfie,Waste of time...,2,29 September 2021,"""Cats"" is a Comedy - Drama musical in which we watch a tribe of cats (Jellicles) that needs to decide and choose one of them to ascend to the Heaviside Layer and later to return back to a new life.I did not like this musical because it seemed that was created a bit sloppy since it had many mistakes. A lot of famous actors and actresses play in this musical but the poor direction of Tom Hooper did not succeed on presenting them as they needed to be and they did not reach their potential. In addition to this, the beautiful music made by Andrew Lloyd Webber unfortunately, it could not save this musical. To sum up, I have to say that ""Cats"" is a poor musical and I do not recommend anyone to watch it because I believe that it's a waste of time.",Cats
19,cruise01,What did i just watch? With a talented director and cast but a terrible film.,3,10 April 2020,"Cats (1.5 out of 5 stars).Cats is a musical fantasy movie based on a play which i never saw. I am curious if the play is way better adapted than how the movie is. Where to start. The opening sequence was good. It had a beautiful musical score. And it falls from there. The musical numbers are boring and forgettable. The plot is thin or barely expressed the story. The direction tries to be colorful with the production and visual effects of the actors as cats. But it looks cheesy. I did had trouble recognizing some of the actors. Except for the obvious ones. This is one musical film that runs too long and uses up its welcome of trying to enjoy it. It is just one musica sequence after another and gets very boring fast.Overall, Cats is one of the worst films this year. The plot is thin. The cast is forgettable. The visual effects seems cheesy and incompleted. The musical sequences is boring. And the direction seems lost through a variety of musical set pieces with no substance.",Cats
20,eddie_baggins,How did this happen?,1,12 January 2020,"Sometimes in life we all ignore that quiet still small voice inside us, that voice with wise judgement urging us to make the right decision, sadly for me I recently ignored this inner voice and my want to see what has been called one of the most downright bad film's of all time is a case of curiosity almost killing the (Eddie) cat.I, like many others had no great desire to see the cinematic adaptation of Andrew Lloyd Webber's stage musical Cats, especially after witnessing the close to frightening trailers, that for some reason decided to mould felines and humans into some form of monstrously designed evil hybrid but after all the press proclaiming the depths of despair this film sinks to, I felt it was my duty too catch it first hand.What I and other viewers are greeted with is a film so lifeless and devoid of any form of spark, that it's nigh on incomprehensible that not only Oscar nominated director Tom Hooper is the man responsible for this crime against film but that he managed to secure 100's of million in cash to make it and recruit an A-list cast to partake in its follies.How any sane person could read the Cats script and think it was going to turn out in a reasonable way is beyond me, as Hopper and his writing team lead this almost entirely song and dance experience through a plot that doesn't even pretend to have a story.There's certainly visions I will never forget, that much I can give the film, images such as James Corden lapping up delicious treats with his cat tongue, Sir Ian McKellan meowing seductively to the camera, Jennifer Hudson's runny nose and Rebel Wilson eating human cockroaches are but some glories but trying to figure out what is happening in this jellicle madness is not worth the brain power.After a seemingly never ending opening song and dance number that almost sends you off the deep end before the shows even really begun, the tale of Francesca Hayward's abandoned cat Victoria and her night out on the town being introduced to all manner of fluffy friends is two hours of pure tedium and pain as we begin to not only question the films existence, but that of life itself.The whole experience is supposed to be a fun and colorful trip to an extra ordinary feline world but despite some undeniably great costumes and set design, this family rated feature is akin to some type of Lovecraftian horror trip as we traverse graveyards, milk clubs and back alleys on our quest to find out who indeed from these cats is the most jellicle.Towards the end of Hopper's disasterpiece, Dame Judi Dench's cat matriarch Deuteronomy stares directly at the audience and proclaims about what we have all learnt throughout the last few hours, it's a bizarre ploy, a scary and uncomfortable ending to a film that needs to be seen to be believed but one that I beg you not to ever watch, let that curiosity go and don't make the same mistakes I did.Final Say -Cats is truly unlike anything we've ever seen before and I trust we will never see again.A plot-less, painful and embarrassingly bad big budget extravaganza that will live long in echelons of epic Hollywood failures.0 snooty noses out of 5",Cats

I have been to see the musical, staged by a reputable touring company, and frankly I hated it. This is not some reaction to the genre, I've seen a number of them, and I like musicals. But ""Cats"" is an artless, plotless, pointless show, with one half decent song and lots of hideous synthesizers that betrays its 80's inception. The film is actually better than the musical in one sense, but in many others is a garish, embarrassing fever dream.Victoria (Francesca Hayward) is a young cat tossed into the streets by an unseen owner. She meets the various cats that live on the streets of London, around the theatre district. She comes on a special night though, as tonight is the Jellicle ball when the show off in an attempt to convince Old Deuteronomy (Judy Dench) that one of them deserves to be reborn.So, I think I've already cleared up what I think of ""Cats"" the musical. The best production in the world would still be the worst choice you could make to spend your time watching and the movie is pretty far from the best production. It does have one improvement. Rather than just two hours of characters introducing themselves, there is a bit of a plot now! Idris Elba's McCavity kidnapping his rivals to make himself the most likely Jellicle choice. Smart. Like it. In terms of other positives. . . .erm . . . I suspect, if you like Ballet, you'll get something out of some of the dances. Maybe.Those meagre positives don't come close though to making up for the hideous other worldly visuals of the CGI blending of the actors with bits of cats. . . sometimes it's little better than a snapchat face-swap app. Scale of the characters varies wildly, depending on the scene and in hardly any of them is comparable to an actual cat. Corden and Rebel Wilson are terrible in their roles. Jason Derulo can at least sing, even if his character is as embarrassing and everyone else's. Jennifer Hudson steps all over ""Memory"" with an emotional performance that comes at the expense of the song.People are going a little overboard with their criticism, it's not the worst film ever. It's probably not even the worst film of the year (though I admit I'm struggling at the moment to think of one) but it is pretty awful.",Cats

27,subxerogravity,It's an acquired taste. Not mine but...,3,23 December 2019,"So like everyone in the world I saw the trailer for this and was turned off by the creepy motion capture effects. I came into this thinking it was going to be a one.
I would like to think a little positive of the film. I've seen the original stage production in my childhood long ago and from what I see here they tried their best to adapt as much as possible of that stage onto the screen.
So the true question is, should you adapted something like Cats? The stage play is basically a series of songs strung together that make a solid story, and are fully met for broadway actors to do interpretive dance numbers to.
If you are into that sort of thing than you may like Cats. The musical numbers are a lot better than the ones in the movie adaption of Le Mes( Le Mes way far superior however)but that's because everyone here can sing. Except Idris Alba. This role was a total mistake for this dude. His whole objective was as an add on character to make sure the story acts like a movie. The only performer who really did this well was James Corbin. He was a funny a charming and for me a tongue and check persona that let me know that even the filmmakers thought this was ridiculous (In my head anyway).
The CGI was not all there. Felt like they were trying to creep me out vs. getting it down packed.
Anyway, not that big a fan of musicals and this is that in every way. If you saw Cats on broadway take the risk you might like it. If you haven't, I know there is at least an Australian production of the stage musical released on DVD that you might want to track down rather than watching this.",Cats

29,stevendbeard,Expecting To Like It. I Didn't.,4,22 December 2019,"I saw ""Cats"", starring Judi Dench-Murder on the Orient Express_2017, the Bond movies; Idris Elba-Fast & Furious Presents:Hobbs & Shaw, Ghost Rider:Spirit of Vengeance; Jennifer Hudson-Empire_tv, The Three Stooges_2012 and introducing Francesca Hayward-a principal ballerina at the Royal Ballet.
This movie is based on the stage musical that was based on a book by T.S. Eliot called 'Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats'. The music is by Andrew Lloyd Webber and he wrote some new songs just for the movie. I am not a big musical fan-I do like some of them-so if you are, you might like this movie more than I did. It has a great cast, with cameos by Rebel Wilson, Ian McKellen, James Corden and Taylor Swift. All the actors went to cat school to learn how to move & act like a cat. I have never seen the Broadway play, but of course, I have heard about it and was expecting to like it. I didn't. Francesca plays an abandoned cat that gets dropped off in a cat neighborhood-it's inhabited by lots of cats. Judi is the ringleader of a group of cats called Jellicles. Once a year, she will pick one deserving cat to ascend to a place called Heavenside Layer-they actually fly up in a balloon into the sky-and then come back to a new Jellicle life. Get it? Heaven & Angelical. Idris plays the villainous cat that thinks he deserves to be chosen by Judi-but she refuses. Jennifer plays another cat that is down on her luck-she wears tattered clothes and skulks around in alleys a lot. You could tell that they put a lot into this movie-especially Francesca-but it just didn't come out right to make me enjoy it. In my theater, there were people that got up & left.
It's rated ""PG"" for rude and suggestive humor and has a running time of 1 hour & 50 minutes.
I wouldn't buy this on DVD or rent it, either. If you are a fan of Cats-or musicals in general-you might like it more than I did. Otherwise, I would wait until it comes to cable.",Cats

31,robfollower,Fun musical film ! Anthropomorphism (the attribution of human characteristics or behavior to an animal.) at its absolute finest. I loved it,9,26 December 2019,"Go see it. If you've ever seen the theatre production then you MUST see this. If you've not seen it then go with an open mind. Read the poetry it's based on.
Adapted from Andrew Lloyd Webber's stage musical, itself inspired by T.S. Eliot's whimsical poems ; Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats. About a tribe of cats called the Jellicles. Who gather once a year to see which of their number will be given the opportunity to ascend to the Heaviside layer. Cats the movie is a slick, computer-enhanced celeb-fest with meticulously choreographed set-pieces taking place in a version of London .Francesca Hayward's 'Victoria' a Principal Ballerina at the Royal Ballet takes centre stage in this remarkable portrayal of the original West End production of Cats. She is not exactly verbose, but her eyes talk plenty, wearing a nonplussed expression throughout as she tries to figure out what in the name of Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats is going on. The score compliments the original 'Webber' magic and stays basically true to the stage musical.If you want a visual feast, knowingly camped up performances from a stellar cast and some beautiful dance & musical numbers this film is a winner. A very well made sentiment to the original stage musical that those who have seen the West End musical will understand totally.",Cats
32,GiraffeDoor,"And so, I say to myself with a purr, the movies most certainly are not as they were.",7,27 January 2020,"I just had to see this movie.Unfortunate moments notwithstanding, it's not half bad. Before you dislike the heck out of me, please let me explain:The criticisms can mostly be reduced to 1 bullet point: ""It's weird"". And that is the opposite of a criticism, surely?Cats is weird. The elevator pitch tells you that.It's not a conventional plot: a bit like ""Nutcracker"" storywise, but with its brief plot spread more thinly throughout. It's actually very mysterious in practice. On the VHS, the numerous visual details of cats interacting have inspired a plethora of fanfiction for the cryptic narrative. A looser variation of the 3 act structure, it's a Macfarlanesque cavalcade of feline splendour that can do anything and go anywhere, allowing stand alone ideas while maintaining all the development of story.They have made every effort to demarcate this from the stage show, most obviously through a color scheme, rejecting the elegiac blue-grey-black for a glitzy yellow-orange-black to recreate London at night. The stage show was bound to one (really cool) set but now, with movie magic, they presented us with the city lights and imposing household interiors that are the real cat's eye view of the world.It's tempting to assume that they did not give the audience the credit to just follow a narrative that keeps its cards close to its chest because they have endeavored to tell a story that leaves a lot to the imagination and then try to fill those gaps without radical changes to the story. The original musical worked as a story because it backed itself and revelled in its own mysteriousness but here we have an unhappy medium between the deliciously unanswered questions on one paw and a conventionally coherent narrative on the other. Fortunately, the fragmented narrative style sort of acts like a shock absorber. The decision to make Victoria the protagonist is logical when you think that in the original stage show, the cats can talk to us but now, with the screen dividing us, we need some sort of audience surrogate. She sings, dances and acts captivatingly.The spoken asides are merely brief interludes to the musical numbers. I wonder if there wasn't untapped potential in trying to really go the whole hog and just make this a more familiar type of musical with a lot of spoken speech as cool-downs between the numbers, even if it involved contriving a new plot. I felt a lot could have been gained by allowing itself to revel in the moment more. When they do hold off from singing there is a lot of expositional dialogue. I quite liked just guessing why they shunned Grizzabella but now I just know. Not that it doesn't have its moments like Victoria interacting with Deuteronomy. The plot they have spun around this actually isn't half bad. The new Macavity is basically a new character for all the new personality they put in him. He is so badass it's almost a pity he's the antagonist. It plays out engagingly and, again, lets me enjoy the story in a new way. The character arc of Mr. Mistofolees was shaky but ultimately was pretty charming only they didn't really go far enough in fleshing it out.Speaking of the musical numbers: I am not a huge Lloyd Webber fan. I find him very hit and miss. But you know how in some musicals, some of the songs are just placeholders for fun lyrics? Well, not here. Each song is one to enjoy again and again no matter what language they're in. They've tweaked the lyrics so that the title cat sings more of their own song than they did in the original and...well I guess it doesn't change anything. Musicologically they're pretty much intact if a bit flipped around. I noticed so many teency differences in the lyrics, it's like researching the changes George Lucas made on the re-releases of Star Wars, but it's all harmless.My most favouritist song of the show (Mungojerrie and Rumpleteazer) has had a bit of a revamp. It was originally an old school musical theatre piece with an Edwardian twist. But now it's been dipped in a kind of roaring Twenties flavour and admittedly it was pretty cool. Again, if I wanted to listen to the other version...I can anytime! Jessica Hudson's Grizabella injects some gospelly soul into this guilty pleasure. Again, agreeably different. Ian McCellan stands out with all the depth and power of Christopher Lee's heavy metal career. Even if everything else they are saying about this movie is true, please believe that Ian just brings it hear, not just in his singing but in his power to make anything seem significant. I can be a bit sour grapes about Taylor Swift, but her and Andrew's original song for the musical is actually...kinda nice. It's a gently heartbreaking little piece that is clearly trying to sort of be Memory pt II but it is so on-brand and has a sweet melody. Swift as a performer here is...adequate. James Corden actually shines as Bustopher Jones. He's really too young for the role but he puts heart into it. Rebel Wilson as Jennyannydots is just bizarre. She is blatantly miscast. She eats one of her cockroaches and those mice-children are just horrific. Just make them mice! And of course: Good ol' Judy...she just can't go wrong. I don't care how many genders you have to bend: if it brings Judy Dench into your movie, you do it.My only issue with the music is that they cut away from it so often. Typically it's the movie sagging under its own star power. I think the executives thought ""make sure you give Wilson and Corden a whole bunch of screen time, the kids will love it!"". There are many such moments that just disrupt the flow, though not irreparably (the songs are that good). At one point Jennyannydots suggests that The Rum Tum Tugger has been neutered because he can hit a high note. If she had just observed ""he can hit the high notes"" and made that scissors gesture, it wouldn't be a strong joke but at least it would work. This moment is a microcosm of the movie's handling of original attempts at humour: not only surplus to requirements but what we have isn't even executed well.Another thing that bothered me was something I struggle to put into words...this could again be my bias as a fan but sometimes they perform the song as just songs, like a recording artist would, not like a musical theatre major would in which they don't just utilize their voice as a beautiful instrument but really crack into the character and the story. The visualization and pacing of a scene probably played a part too.I mentioned how they updated M&R: for me the Musical was sort of a bastion of Quintessential English Quaintness. They have modernized it and thus inevitably Americanized it but that isn't really a problem. Along with the narrative issues I mentioned above, it makes the whole picture feel quite adventitious; something that was never meant to be, but just sort of exists from the collision of several discrete creative minds and the wrong people having way too much creative control.Finally I get to the thing that everyone is talking about: the cats themselves. When I first saw the trailer I thought they looked rather grotesque. Again, it's the problem of too much star power. Why put such high profile names if you're just going to hide the faces? Said the producers to each other over hot-tub-caviar. Thus we get these jarringly human faces glued onto the cat body. But not all the cats were like this. I am tempted to say they should've either just made the whole thing an animated musical with photorealistic cats or used practical effects.But ultimately I found that you can get used to this. It actually gave it a kooky charm, like the visible strings of a marionette or or how a Japanese cartoon characters talk like ventriloquist dummies. The fact that the face is basically intact stops it from being uncanny valley. The performers do evoke the body language of cats, harmonizing the movement types of two species into one organism. They go together without mixing but never mind. The fur is admittedly really detailed and even moves in the wind in a way that had me hypnotized. I like how they integrated cat sounds into the speech; the sultry purrs, the high pitched mewing for Tugger...Nice.On an angry note, I was promised something way more sexual than this. Now, I'm not saying it wasn't sensual and to be honest I wanted to cuddle with each cat but they said it looked like weird but boy did they hyperbolize. It's not a new kind, it's a very old kind: ballet! Ballet is sexy! But maybe some people can't take it. So yeah: the people who said this movie made them physically uncomfortable for all the cat-on-cat touching are people I suspect are just unfairly projecting their own neuroses onto the movie.My biggest problems are either knitpicky or a fixation on something they didn't do. But one can go on forever about what something ISN'T and it only distracts from the good things that it IS.In this movie they do a very particular thing, for a very particular type of person. They have constructed this lurid, garish world contrived of the choicest parts of both dreams and nightmares, woven with CGI, with people who are not people, non-humans who are all too human. This movie is a creepy, uncomfortable phantasmagoria of glorious weirdness that you just need to take on the chin as a sequence of strange moments that lead you into a magical new world, all the more magical for being familiar.It is an experience that is enriched by the various artistic choices that have you scratching your head. Even if this movie goes against present standards of cool or decency (decency is code for boring!), it can at least say it is genuinely unique. And in a world with too many whooshy horror movies, trite romantic comedies and so many Spiderman movies, that has to count for something.Let Cats take you on a ride you will not soon forget.",Cats
33,CubsandCulture,This is a not a good movie but it is a *glorious* hot mess,10,1 January 2020,"My rating is based on how much I enjoy the film, not what I think of its quality.Anyway this is such a bizarre film that it is almost impossible to not love on some level. There is no real story-even through the screenplay adds clear tension and an antagonist the stage show is lacking-and it is basically a series of vaudeville acts. Each cat sort of conforms to a stock character-i.e. the old actor, the fat comedian, tricksters etc. that performs a song. The songs very in quality but there are no clunkers. I am rather fond of Gus's song, ""Skimbleshanks"" and ""Mungojerrie and Rumpleteazer."" Unlike other Weber work the score has a wide scope and each song has its own feel. It doesn't add up to much. It is just some cheap sentiment and some laughs, but darn if ""Memory"" didn't convey some pathos and wasn't a tearjerker of a song.Hooper does *a lot* better at staging the songs in this film than he did in Les Miserables. The camera is kept alive and there is no extreme close-ups. Likewise, cinematography, art direction are all top notch. I like that they kept the scale cat size but also grand. AND the film is appropriately art deco. I suspect this is best film, technically, you can derive from the stage show.Now it is true that the costumes/CGI don't quite work. The faces bothered me far less than the hands. Also, I still don't understand why some cats had clothes on and some didn't. Eventually, about 10 minutes in, you get over the uncanny valley effect and you just sort of accept the bizarre world the film take place in. The hands distracted me throughout because claws came and went for some unknown reason.I think the cast largely does about as well as anyone can do. Ian McKellen gives the *best* performance; he sings quite well. The Gus section is legitimately good. There is a bit of tonal clash because the various actors are treating the concept with different degrees of seriousness. Wilson, especially, seemed unwilling to buy into it. This just adds to the wonderful weirdness of the whole thing.I think in time this film is going to be a campy classic.",Cats

Cats is a song and dance review held together by a very thin plot ie each character does a number as their nomination for getting the prize of going to the heavyside layer - that's it. It is not a typical musical and this is how it was when first launched at the theatre in London in 1981. If you want a classical 'musical' - avoid, but anyone who saw the stage show will recognise this.However, in bringing this tightly knitted, almost claustrophobic show to the big screen, mistakes have been made. There is an attempt to try and create a story to explain what's going on and to broaden that 'story' which doesn't work plus there are some seriously bad musical numbers eg those with Rebel Wilson and James Corden plus Alba just isn't right for Macavity. Dench is lovely and has the gravitas and acting chops for Deuteronomy, but a singing voice would be nice, but both she and McKellan emerge with dignity intact.Overall then better than everyone is saying with the most wonderful sets and some good set pieces, but not remotely near the spectacular, moving experience it should have been.",Cats

39,questl-18592,Rats,3,6 November 2020,"Oh boy, if ever there was a movie that I had to watch because everyone said how bad it was, Cats is it. Nothing could be as awful, as wretched, as eye assaultingly bad as Cats is made out to be, could it? Short answer: No. Don't get me wrong, this is a bad movie, but I don't get the rage people seem to harbor toward it. It's weird, awkward, clunky and makes zero sense and doesn't try to and is filled with CGI that is at best very, very odd and at worst bile-inducing. That describes most of Michael Bay's filmography and people still flock in droves to his disasters without all this raucous about them.Let me say it, I didn't think the CGI was all that bad for the majority of this film. The problem I have is that when you try to make real people look like realistic CGI anthromorphic cats and have them try to imitate catlike gestures things get really weird, really fast. That's pretty much this movie though, we're dumped into this world with no real explanation for anything, there's a lot of gibberish spoken that means nothing to anyone and we're off to the races with song after song after song along with a litany of cameos and big names donning the whiskers. At no point do I care in the slightest bit about any of it, possible because at no point do they bother to explain any of it using English.That's the biggest problem though, to me. It's not the CGI or the story or any of that. It's seeing all these exceptional actors being put in these ridiculous facades and made to do absurd and disgraceful things. Sir Ian Mckellen should not have anything to do with this, nor should Dame Judi Dench or Idris Elba. This is a black mark on at least two legendary careers and one with a great deal of promise still.The music is fine, a couple of songs have some weight to them but they're all undercut by that recurring theme of I DON'T CARE ABOUT ANY OF THIS! Try to blackmail me emotionally all you want with the swelling tones and beautiful voices but if I'm not the least bit invested in these things then you might as well belt out.a ballad to soggy bread because I just don't care.That's the story of Cats. I just don't care. A week from now I'll have forgotten most of what I'd seen and simply remember this was bad and not bother with it again. There's no great anger or emotional connection because there was nothing to connect to. I turned it on, 110 minutes later it was over and that was that. Barely a flick of the needle, nary a twitch of the gauge. It was, then it wasn't.Don't watch this though. Movies should illicit some sort of reaction beyond indifference. Go find something that'll bring some joy, something that'll make you think or something that'll upset you, I have some of my favorite movie conversations about movies that really annoyed me. There's no conversation here, I'll finish typing and it will leave my memory banks and-",Cats
40,truemythmedia,Makes You Feel Icky,1,7 January 2020,"If you are reading this review, then you probably already know that ""Cats"" has been widely panned by critical and general audiences since before it was even released. After releasing, some of the cgi was considered so jarring that updates to the film were made and new versions screened after the first couple of weeks in the theaters. Unfortunately, there was no way to erase the movie, and money spent on it, from existence entirely which is what this film really needs.I can't say this will be along review. I can only describe for so long the strange sights and sounds of ""Cats"" because without the context of seeing the film it is nigh impossible to relate the discomfort, cringe inducing, and baffling moments that barrage you from the moment the film begins.We open with a cat being tossed into the street inside of a bag and being freed by a group of cats called Jellicle . If you don't know what that means, don't worry. It won't be important and, like many things in this movie, won't be explained or of interest to either the characters in the film or the audience watching it. These Jellicle all sing songs about themselves and how special they are with the hopes of being chosen at the Jellicle Ball to go on to their afterlife/reward/heaven.Seriously, the whole movie is just these cats singing about how much they like to dance, eat mice, and do magic.The ways that this film goes off are innumerable from CGI that is jarring, to added one-liners that will have even the punniest jokesters rolling their eyes, and on to unexplained and convenient magical powers but the way that it seems to miss most profoundly, to me, is the entire conception and direction if this mainstay Broadway work.""Cats,"" the theatrical production, is not loved because of its plot. It is loved because of the unique concept, dancing, and singing. When you take away the actual building of large sets and people acting like they are cat sized with just make-up and leotards you end up diminishing the skill necessary to create such an illusion. The productions works as a stage musical because you can't use cgi, an actor has to be able to leap that way or sing/purr that way with no help from computers. It is impressive. When it is all done with computers, there is no skill to be amazed by. The actor aren't really singing these songs even as they perform difficult dances. The actors themselves aren't really very good singers and only a few numbers actually land well at all.It seems like a person who had no particular love for the musical form or specifically ""Cats"" got tasked with making it (though I am sure this is not so) and they never really understood what made the play special at all. They thus turned out a film which is only special in its tremendous failure and misconception from the start.",Cats
41,mrdonleone,Leave the Room while you can,3,27 January 2020,"Cat's is funny at times though mostly boring. The camera angles constantly change, thereby creating a feeling of confusion with the viewer. There are too many fragments edited into one scene, making all other experiences of the songs stand out as quite incapable to be loved or even appreciated. Big names are used to sell this celluloid crap, but if you have a bit of self value you simply leave the room long as this is on.",Cats
42,davidmvining,Just so much catnip,2,9 November 2020,"I don't like to use the word flawed when talking about movies, but sometimes it's unavoidable. Cats is deeply, deeply flawed. It's the sort of flawed that makes the movie's mere existence a flabbergasting paradox, leaving one with questions about the layers and layers Tom Hooper had to work through to get the $95 million to produce and release such a broken, ill-conceived piece of cinema. He convinced studio executives, producers, production designers, and visual effects supervisors that his idea was a good one, and it was bad from the start.Musical theater is, let's face it, a niche medium. The biggest show last year, The Great White Way, was attended by 350,000 people total throughout the year. By comparison, roughly 100,000,000 people saw Avengers Endgame in theaters in 2019. On top of that, musical theater is a vastly different medium from cinema. What can work as spectacle in a closed theater won't necessarily work as spectacle on a movie screen. I can imagine the effect a live performance of Cats would have on the musical theater lovers of the world. The sights and sounds of people dressed up as cats running up and down the aisle and swinging around in front of them is probably rather enticing. I don't really think it would work on me personally, but I sort of get it.That doesn't mean that it will translate to cinema where we've been inundated with spectacular sights for decades. People looking like cats and singing showtunes is mundane when compared to the worlds of Pandora or Middle-Earth. There's no spectacle here in comparison to what we're used to. That's really just looking at the idea generically, though. In practical reality, Tom Hooper took the exact wrong approach to the movie's visual effects.The stories of the visual artists working 90 hour weeks and sleeping under their desks to finish the complete film's special effects in just four months are on the IMDb trivia page, and the quick work is exceedingly evident on screen. There's almost never a single shot where the movement of the cats doesn't look janky in some way. Arms move wrong. Whenever the cats dance, they seem to jump between frames. There are even copious moments where heads seem disconnected from bodies. Even the musical numbers, in particular the dancing, feels too smooth and then too jerky at the same time, invalidating what must have been very good work by the performers with a bad layer of digital paint that's impossible to unsee. Every character on screen for the entire one-hundred minute runtime falls firmly in the Uncanny Valley and never escapes it. Every minute of this movie feels wrong just looking at it, and that's the biggest source of audiences' problems with the film. Someone, at some point, should have made Hooper use practical costumes and makeup.Here's the thing, though, the story underneath, even if they had fixed the special effects, is pretty much non-existent. It's spectacle designed for musical theater, and all it is amounts to a series of songs of different cats singing about themselves in a row. There's no real story, and the enjoyment factor of the audience entirely hinges on their desire to hear music. It reminded me of Francis Ford Coppola's Cotton Club where the point was the recreation of the physical space and the music that went with it. There was a story, but it was unconvincing and unimportant. Coppola was only interested in the music. Cats is similar, except that's the source material. It's a revue. There's no real story to be had. It's almost just a series of music videos.The little story that is there amounts to a cat being dumped in an alley in London and meeting a weird society of cats on the Jelical night where one gets chosen to be sent into the sky and reborn into a new life. The main character, Victoria, wanders through the society, listening to each one sing about themselves before moving on to the next. In the midst of this is Macavity, a bad cat that is trying to cheat his way into being chosen (why? I dunno...these aren't characters in any real sense of the word). Eventually, he kidnaps Deuteronomy, the one who makes the choice, and Victoria has to convince the magical cat to make Deuteronomy reappear before introducing Grizabella and getting her chosen...It's nonsense. Grizabella has the number ""Memory"" that everyone remembers, but because Grizabella isn't really a character, instead just a single character trait that requires a soulful singing of a single song. I can fully see a certain segment of the population weeping bitterly at the soulful rendition, but narratively Grizabella is a non-entity, so her emotional impact is limited.This movie should never have been made. I could imagine it working as a fully animated film with cats that look like, you know, cats (like Spielberg originally tried to do when he had a hand drawn animated division decades ago, hence Amblin being a production company on the film). The story is theatrical and bare, so having it exist in this weird middle space between CGI spectacle, theatrical reproduction, and cinema disaster does it no favors. It takes an idea that should have never made it to the big screen and completely undermines it even more. This is ""Springtime for Hitler"" made for real. A movie so bad that the tax man won't look too closely at the books. I will say, though, that Jennifer Hudson does give a soulful performance as Grizabella.",Cats
43,jadepietro,Neutered,4,22 December 2019,"GRADE: C-THIS FILM IS NOT RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: Some nice dance moves still cannot help this movie which needs to be de-clawed for any moviegoer's safety.JIM'S REVIEW: Critics have savagely reviewed the ""cat-aclysmic"" fiasco known as Cats, and the general public is hightailing it in another direction. But let me come to its defense for a short fleeting moment. I did enjoy some of the ballet, tap, and modern dance moves, that is, whenever I was able to see them. While it's true that Cats is not a good movie, it isn't the worst movie musical ever made as many now seem to be saying. Compared to Mame, A Chorus Line, Man of La Mancha, The Wiz and Annie, nothing comes near those infamous duds. But this film adaptation does come exceedingly close.When Cats premiered on Broadway in 1981, it was a theatrical juggernaut, a eye-popping blending of song and dance with artistic showmanship that made it a must-see pop spectacle. Yes, the plot was nowhere to be seen, then and now, but there was enough stage craft to keep audiences dazzled. Alas, the film version of T. S. Eliot's ode to the feline life is mere kitty litter in comparison.Tom Hooper's Cats is just creepy from its hybrid costumes and inconsistent make-up design to its out of proportion and literally out-of-place set design by Eve Stewart and Rebecca Pilkington (the major misstep in a film flawed with many moments). The buildings that show off parts of London continually show off and dwarf their inhabitants, both in stature and performances. Size does matter and one gets vertigo with the erratic changes in ratio dimensions. (When the film stays in mid-range, the annoying backdrops stop interfering with the performances. But...step back a few yards, and...oh my!)Mr. Hooper seems content to showcase many of the musical numbers with more glitz than flair, and he allows much of Melanie Oliver's editing to sacrifice the dance movement with quick cuts and an overabundance of close-ups. The fault of this musical concept lies squarely at the paws of its filmmaker, Mr. Hooper. His misguided attempt at directing musicals must stop. He is a far better director when dealing with dramas and needs to stay within his own artistic limits.His screenplay, co-authored with Lee Hall, is a muddle. The non-existent plot still has all of these kitty cats going to a Jellicle Ball to see which one will go to the Heaviside Layer and be resurrected into a new and better life. Both writers do try to add some sub-plots involving good and evil cats vying for this honor, but it is a silly attempt to add some substance over style that never really advances the plot. We meet each cat, listen to their ""tail"" of woe, watch them do their musical schtick and then it's onto the next audition. Some numbers are better than others, but one is absolutely dreadful: Rebel Wilson does an awful kitschy musical number that is some sort of daffy homage to Busby Berkeley complete with singing mice and dancing cockroaches...duh, the film's low point among few highs.Andrew Lloyd Webber's score is mostly intact but the orchestrations are crass and updated with over engineered results. Everything is loud and lacking any subtlety. Perhaps too much catnip, or not enough. (The one new song, Beautiful Ghost, written by Sir Andrew and Ms Swift, is far from haunting.)The entire concept is misguided and poorly executed, except for one musical number that celebrates song and dance very well, The Jellicle Ball. Animation would have been a better solution than this live-action mess. It's is a hairball inducing experience. These cats are sci-fi freaky mutants: more human than feline. Their facial features lack emotion amid sub-par CGI fur that never appears to be right, although the ear and tail movements are intriguingly accomplished. The costumes by Pace Delgado establish individual character traits rather quickly, but they just don't mesh with their over-sized surroundings. (So many questions and leaps of logic: Why do this creatures have hands instead of paws? Why couldn't the movie be filmed with more wide angle shots to actually see and enjoy the the dance moves in Andy Blankenbuehler's choreography? When did T.S. Eliot's poems have his cats become such sexual creature in the form of street prostitutes, vixens, and pimps? Why do some cats wear clothes and others go au naturel?)The cast include a cast of hard-working professionals that put their faith in Mr. Hooper's hands and were betrayed and neutered. The victims include: an embarrassing Ms. Wilson, Idris Elba as the evil Macavity dressed as a cat-like pimp in skin-tight leotards and Taylor Swift as his sexy sidekick, Bombalurina, and Jason Derulo as a kinetic Rum Tum Tiger. Also brought into this brouhaha are fine dancers like Robbie Fairchild, Francesca Hayward, Steven McRae, and Laurie Davidson as Mr. Mistoffelees, but their grace and dancing skills are impaired by Mr. Hooper's filming. Jennifer Hudson belts out the signature tune from the show, Memory, and she bring some class to the affair, although her cat look is too grisly a Grizabella and this unfortunately distracts from the performance. Still, a few actors went through their paces unscathed: Judy Dench as the wise Old Deuteronomy, Ian Mc Kellen as Gus the Theatre Cat, and James Corden as the chubby Bustopher Jones.Yet so many questions and leaps of logic remain lodged in my ""memory"": Why do this creatures have hands instead of paws? Why couldn't the movie be filmed with more wide angle shots to actually see and enjoy the the dance moves in Andy Blankenbuehler's choreography? When did T.S. Eliot's poems have his cats become such sexual creatures in the form of street prostitutes, vixens, and pimps? Why do some cats wear clothes and others go au naturel? As a far superior musical once said, ""Is a puzzlement!"")The old adage goes: ""A cat has nine lives."", meaning it is able to endure or survive any disaster. Revising that saying to review, with a slightly German emphasis: ""This Cats has ""nein"" lives."", meaning this movie is a lifeless soul-crushing disaster that moviegoers may endure or survive...barely.

The Fake look sometimes
Not utilizing the Cast Well
Not Taking The Creative Liberties When They should have
Just Limited Over AllThe Verdict:Cats is what you expect from the trailers, a big musical number that is all about dancing and soundtracks and little of anything else. The technology prowess reigns supreme in bringing the world and visuals to life, and many of the new twists to the songs give it a breath of fresh air to liven things up. Yet, this face paced dance flick just really does not deliver on many things outside of the lavish numbers. Rather than taking some liberties to expand the story and use of the characters, the movie sticks a little too close to the traditional roots, leaving it very simple and kind of dull in the grand scheme of things. If you are looking to experience the show for the first time, this could be a decent substitute, but for those in love of the plays or looking for a musical with more sustenance, heart, and coordination, well you should go in with lower expectations. As such, I'm mixed in terms of telling you if worth a theater visit, but for the stage show, effects, and visual numbers the theater will assist, but for everything else, watch this one at home instead. Due to the missed potential this movie could have done, I'll give this film a:Comedy/Drama/Family: 5.0

45,ArtVandelayImporterExporter,"Way, way, way, way better than the reviews led me to believe",10,15 October 2020,"I saw Cats in London in a theatre so intimate we had cats crawling all around us. It was pretty cool. But I also detest Andrew Lloyd Weber for turning Les Miserables into that insipid Les Miz. Miserable, indeed.But come on, IMDB reviews, 2.6 (as of this writing)? Just for that I'm giving it a 10 (which it isn't, either) in the hope that before I did enough people do the same and the overal rating gets back up to something realistic.Hollywood releases on average a super-hero movie per week that is depths below this movie and the teenage wasteland gooses them up to 8+.Arnold movies, Bruce Willis movies, Nicolas Cage movies - gawd the list goes on - regularly garner 6 or better around here even though they have zero redeeming value most of the time. .Heck, just compare Cats to, say, Moulin Rouge, which is a loud, obnoxious, poorly performed music video/karaoke night. There's no doubt Cats is much better and it's not even close.And didn't LALALALALAnd win the Oscar? Or was the Faye Dunaway's mistake on awards night? I can't remember anymore. In any event, that was as putrid a musical as has EVER been made. As in the entire 100 years of the talkie era, LALALALALAND is conceivably the worst musical of all time. And I'm not even joking. Well, Cats is miles better.I gather Cats probably bombed at the box office. I wouldn't be surprised if it sells about a billion units on Blu-Ray and DVD and streaming and whatever else the kids are into these days, and ends up being cited by people everywhere as ''their favorite movie musical growing up.""I would have no trouble whatsoever recommending this movie to musical fans of all ages.

That moment when all is well and suddenly your cat starts to make that awful retching/puking sound.You spin in place to stare at your cat, who looks at you as if all is well. Then its sides heave and the noise begins again. The precursor to it vomiting forth something evil from within itself. Something that should not ever see the light of day.It's that moment... when you have to make the fateful decision. Do I pick up the cat and try to make it to the back door? Or do I let things take their course and accept the inevitable eruption of Mount Catspewvius? One offers hope, but is tinged with the danger of wearing kittie's puke. The other, resigning yourself to a grim cleanup. Either way, the smell will be in your nostrils for hours.That, my friends is the same terrible helpless feeling you will get the moment that Cats starts to play. The paralyzing fear... Do I stay, or do I go? If you go there may be trouble but, trust me, if you stay it will be much more than double!Cats is...freakish! The moment you see them in all their hideous CGI-ness you will not be the same again. You cannot unsee that which human eyes were never meant to witness. The terrible CGI, the dancing, the awful songs. The continued and inexplicable employment of James Corden and Rebel Wilson. It is Lovecraftian in its portrayal. The mind cannot make sense of it.I do not think I will ever be the same again.

47,Gislef,Some Good Bits...,5,11 March 2021,"... but they're all from the original musical. So the score, basically. And the dancing is good. And there are a couple of good acting bits. Judi Dench and Ian McKellan are old pros, so they can make anything good. Laurie Davidson as Mistoffles is good, too,But... Rebel Wilson as Jennyanydots. My eyes, my eyes! Good lord, I just wanted to tear my eyes out of their sockets every time she was on-screen. They also mangled the Rum Tum Tigger/Mungojerrie song. And I hope you like Francesca Hayward. Because there's a _lot_ of her character, Victoria. Hayward fills out a skintight real well. And she's a talented dancer, I'll grant that.And the set design. It's a weird mix of enlarged fake-looking green-screen sets, and fake-looking green-screen shots of London. When the camera settles down and just lets us watch the dancers dance, there's some good dancing, it's fine. McKellan's Gus song is pretty good, because director Tom Hopper lets him take center stage and focuses on McKellan's performance.But the railway station/track actively takes away from Steven McRae's tap-dancing routine. When you can just watch him performing, it's sublime. But then Hooper tosses in either the blown-up railway car, or the green-screen London railway tracks. And it all goes to pot.And then Hooper cuts back to Rebel Wilson from time to time, who hams it up like nobody's business. Even when she isn't the feature singer.Overall, the movie is just for completists who just want to sit back and listen to the songs. And peek over from time to time to catch the dance numbers. Sadly, you'll have to probably watch the whole thing to catch the good parts. Anything with McKellan, Laurie Davidson, Taylor Swift (her ""McCavity"" is okay), and McRae's tap-dancing.

The critics are generally panning it which may be why it isn't getting the box office success it needs to recoup its $90 million budget. But, I liked it. The cast comes from a variety of performance platforms (ballet, pop, theatre, comedy, screened media) but I thought it played well to their respective strengths. Francesca Hayward's skill as a principal dancer, her look and her angelic voice gave a transformative centre for the piece. The dramatic quality of the cast is incontrovertible (Dench, McKellen, Elba). Contrary to the critics, I liked the CGI, thought the story was more enveloping that the book or the musical and can, off the top of my head, think of a host of films that would better qualify as the worst film of 2019.

Now that being said pretty much nothing worked in this film and honestly I'm just not sure whose fault it was. From a base level the story and songs confused me and weren't very engaging. The cgi and makeup and costuming or combination were really off putting and nightmarish at moments. At times it looked as though there faces were floating and coming out of the screen like Renesme from Breaking Dawn. I'm not blaming any of the actors here accept the lead was lackluster and Jason Derulo was bad. Rebel Wilson was kind of funny, Taylor Swift was amusing and charismatic but Jennifer Hudson actually was pretty damn good. She gave me chills and made me tear up at the end even though I hated the movie. And I did hate the movie but am really just confused by it. It looks as though they really tried their best. I really think it was just unfilmable.

53,Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187,Probably the worst film since Battlefield Earth!,1,4 October 2021,"Cats is AWFUL; it's hysterically (but SUPER ironically) funny from the get-go. The story's non-existent, the characters are shallow but worst of all they don't look like actual cats at all; they look like a science experiment gone horribly wrong. I was virtually in tears of laughter form the first five minutes alone; and that's not a compliment, because this film was supposed to be a character-centric comedy-drama instead of a furry's fever dream on Broadway/West End seemingly 'directed' by Tobe 'The King's Speech' Hooper. What happened!? I was laughing because of the bad graphics and muddled singing; THAT and the clueless direction that doesn't translate from stage musical to movie at all (if it were actually animated it might have had a fighting chance at being good).Cats is definitely 2019's greatest horror-comedy for all the wrong reasons: its uncanny effects and film-crippling performances from James Corden and Rebel Wilson make this all feel like it was never real; but it was. Universal bankrolled this film AND a campaign to COMPETE AT THE OSCARS!? If this got nominated for Best Picture (which thankfully it didn't) it would have turned the WHOLE ceremony into an immortal joke.Cats is 2019's ironic classic; it's bound to become a midnight movie favourite in the style of Birdemic rather than The Room (because The Room is actually entertaining with its unawareness and unintentional farce).0/5 stars (honestly).

54,Jeremy_Urquhart,What a wonderful mess,2,20 January 2020,"Cats is as baffling and bad as you've likely heard by this point. I'm not here to tell you it's actually good, but I do want to say that it is... watchable. And not just that, but honestly worth watching. It is such a confusing, trippy, fundamentally wrong train-wreck on just about every level, but it's oddly compelling and if you're in the right frame of mind, a lot of fun. It just continually ups itself in terms of being weird, uncomfortable, and borderline disgusting, and it makes for a strangely mesmerising experience. If I were to make a list of my favourite so bad they're good movies, I think Cats would make it into my top 5.I'm not sure I was meant to feel the things I did while watching Cats, however. I'll give the movie some credit and assume that to some extent, it was likely supposed to be campy, goofy, and more than a little weird. However, I think some of it verges into being too weird and unsettling- basically borderline experimental in parts, and at a basic level, the character design is just wrong. I'd find it hard to believe that the filmmakers wanted the characters to look as uncanny and gross as they do.Maybe to a very limited degree you get used to the strange character designs and uncanny valley effect of it all as the film goes on, but never completely, because the unsettling qualities just keep upping themselves. Rebel Wilson takes off her skin to reveal clothes underneath after eating a bunch of cockroaches with human faces, Judi Dench licks herself, Idris Elba teleports, Ian McKellen meows and rubs up against stuff, then Idris Elba (again) in his last two scenes suddenly has no clothes. Oh, and the film ends with Judi Dench breaking the fourth wall (no other cat does though) and singing to the audience about how to properly address a cat. I was trying my best not to howl with laughter in an admittedly fairly empty cinema by this point.The film is made all the more baffling by the things about it that almost work, most prominently when Jennifer Hudson's character sings ""Memory."" It's a great song. Hudson has a great voice. Performance-wise she's good too, clearly giving it her all and dialling the passion up to eleven. But... she's covered in that infamous 'digital fur' and at the end of the day, is brilliantly singing and acting a great song while looking like a horrific human-cat hybrid. They were 90% of the way there to making this scene as effecting as Anne Hathaway's similar ""I Dreamed A Dream"" sequence from Les Miserables, but the character design ultimately ruins it.Would Cats be a good movie if they'd stuck to either physical actors in costumes or just made it all animated? It's hard to say, because the characters still wouldn't be more than one-dimensional, the story would still have been almost non-existent, and the backdrops and locations would have still been empty, eerie, and even almost post-apocalyptic with their static lack of life besides the sometimes tiny sometimes not so tiny (the scale is WACK) titular cats. We might've had an overall average musical- a lot of what pushes this over the edge into memorable so bad it's good/ possible future cult classic status is the miserable use of terrifying CGI on all the main characters.So maybe for that I should be thankful. Entertaining trainwrecks are hard to come by, and at the end of the day, this movie doesn't make me angry and doesn't make me feel like I wasted my money on it, despite the fact that just about every creative decision was wrong and that one day it may well give me nightmares. Watching it was a blast, and I think I'll probably watch it again at some point, because it's that bizarrely compelling.The numerical rating is arbitrary. In some ways this is a 1, in some ways it's like an 8 or 9, I have no idea. It's a 2 for now but that's subject to change. It could be anything.It defies ratings.Cats/10.",Cats

58,rockman182,Cats (2019),2,22 December 2019,"I have never seen the musical that this film is based on but I am familiar with Andrew Lloyd Webber as I love Phantom of the Opera and everything about it. With that thought, I figured an adaptation of another of his musicals would be solid. The initial trailer was polarizing and drew warranted ire. To make matters worse the reviews that came out yesterday absolutely trashed the film. Now having seen it, it is safe to say that this film is laughably horrendous and certainly the worst film of the year. Wow, this was an incredible level of bad.
The film is about an abandoned cat named Victoria who is dropped into the streets one night. She becomes familiar with the other local cats of the town. It turns out there is a gang of cats named Jellicle's and she learns how to be one of them. There is a Jellicle ball where the selected cat wins the competition and gets sent to Heaviside Layer, which is desired by the cats. This film has an impressive ensemble cast, all of whom must be hanging their head in shame because this now appears on their resume.From the opening scene the theater burst into laughter. Not because the film was intentionally comedic at the moment but because the CGI/effects are absolutely atrocious. I would have preferred regular live characters in cat make up than the off putting and at times creepy human face on effect heavy cat body. At times I wondered if Tom Hooper was self aware with how terrible everything looked but then I remembered he is a filmmaker linked with Oscar nominated films and don't think that was the case. The film was much like Les Miserables from Hooper which I also hated. Its almost completely music, song after song so its dull and boring.
The film feels so long because of the incessant singing and dancing and this makes it feel like there's nothing going on. The plot is incredibly thin and its painfully obvious. Its just song and dance introducing a new cat who then fades away into the background. Didn't care a whole lot for the music, although I am sure that its technically great. Not even Taylor Swift (who I love), could redeem this morbid affair. Even the intended humorous cat characters like Rebel Wilson and James Corden fall miserably flat.
I thought Black Christmas was going to be my worst film of 2019 but lo and behold a week later something takes that honor quick. It was an unwatchable horror show. People may like this for the so bad its good factor but for me this was a painful time. After hearing critical reaction I knew it would be bad and that is exactly what this is. Tom Hooper won't be living this failure down for a while.

I love all of the cat feline movements, and I noticed in the closing credits that there was an actual feline movement consultant training the actor-dancers in exactly how to be catlike on stage.In acting classes, students have to get up on stage and become any animal or creature that the director assigns. I have been in acting classes where we had to take imaginary hot or cold showers, plus put on imaginary makeup while looking into an imaginary mirror. This is called sense memory concentration.If our professor had told us to go up on stage and become cats, then that would be what we would have had to become if we wanted good grades in this theatre course.10 / 10",Cats
60,RforFilm,What works on stage bombs as a film. Cats doesn't deserve a second life,2,27 December 2019,"If you've known someone that's loved musical theater and Broadway, then at some point, Cats has been brought up. Some people love it and some just don't get it. I'll admit that I've seen the stage show twice (neither which were my idea) and it's not my thing. It's interesting to see the makeup and junkyard design for something that's still abstract and light on story. In fact, all I can say about it is that it centers around a tribe of cats and several of them do a song and dance to be chosen for another life. And given how it's sung through its entirety, that's either going to make it or break it for most.I know that Cats had been one of Broadway's longest running shows and continues to play at a lot of community theaters and touring groups. Naturally, this was also something that had been attempted as a movie. Cats is already hard to do on stage and would never be easy to translate. I know that when the first trailers popped up, it got a lot of negative feedback for its choice of CGI animation on the human-like cats. Does Cats translate to the big screen?A white kitten Victoria (played by Francesca Hayward) is abandoned in an alleyway by its owner and is discovered by a group of street cats called the ""Jellicles"". Some include a magician Mr. Mistoffelees (played by Laurie Davidson) and Munkustrap (played by Robbie Fairchild). They take a liking to Victoria and take her to the Jellicle Ball where they say that their leader will select one for the chance to be taken to the Heaviside Layer and be granted another life. Brown cat Macavity (played by Idris Elba) badly wants the honor and will try to sabotage the other cats.Storywise, this is all you need to know. Like the stage show, the rest consists of other cats singing and dancing their songs on why they should be chosen. Such cats include Bustopher Jones (played by James Corden), Rum Tum Tugger (played by Jason Delrulo), Gus the Theatre Cat (played by Ian McKellen), Jennyanydots (played by Rebel Wilson) and Bombalurina (played by Taylor Swift). Also in the mix, and ostrasized by the other cats is Grizabella (played by Jennifer Hudson). Who will Old Deuteronomy (played by Judi Dench) chose?So who was Cats made for? It seems like that only fans of the stage show are going to get much out of Cats. The rest, including myself, get something that may have a lot of ambition, but comes out in a giant mess. I'll start by saying that there's little focus on story (again, like the Broadway show). I'm normally fine with a movie that's more loose with story, but you better make sure the characters are at least interesting. The ironic thing is even with a lot of characters getting songs, I know very little about them. Many of them have few scenes (sometimes only one) and the main cat herself, Victoria isn't that interesting.It made me realize that the stage show broke the forth wall and took the audience on an abstract journey. I kind of wished the movie would have done something similar. It tries by having a cat fill in the role of the audience, but that gives us without a character to latch onto.Let's talk about the CGI. I knew that something different was going to be done for the movie, but along with it not looking finished, the human-like design is so freakish, that I could see children having nightmares. It's ugly, gross and I hate looking at it for nearly two hours!As a musical, some of the songs like ""Rum Tum Tugger"", ""Bustopher Jones"" and ""Jellicle Songs for Jellecle Cats"" are entertaining. The rest are fine, but nothing that I'm going to remember. I didn't even care for the way ""Memory"" was rearranged, making small moments big and vice versa.In addition to the set design, it is at least impressive to look at. But even as a movie that's so bad that's good, I still can't recommend it as its still too boring.I'll give this two stage cats out of ten. I'm not sure what Warner Brothers was thinking with the story, visuals, music, and even overall concept. Cats doesn't deserve a second life and let's just leave it at that.",Cats
61,bankofmarquis,Took out what works in this musical and left what didn't,2,20 November 2020,"I had heard that the movie version of the mega-Broadway hit musical CATS was a ""total trainwreck"" with bizarre performances and CGI that was incomplete and/or incompetently done making these CATS look more like FREAKS, so I was looking forward to a ""so bad it's good"" experience at the film. But, instead of being horrified or bemused, I felt another emotion while watching this...BOREDOM.I've never been a real fan of the Broadway production - I witnessed the original cast back in the early 1980's and had a follow-up viewing of the show on Broadway in the mid-to-late '90's when 2 people I know were in the cast and both times I enjoyed the music (for the most part) and the dancing was SUPERB, but I was left disappointed by the characters and the plot (or lack thereof) of this show.And...that's the biggest problem with the film version of CATS, Director Tom Hooper (LES MISERABLES) decided to focus this film ON the characters and the performances - headlined by such stalwarts as Dame Judy Dench, Sir Ian McKellen, Idris, Elba, Ray Winstone, Jennifer Hudson, James Cordon and Rebel Wilson - and ignore the spectacle of the musical numbers and, most heinously, ignoring the dancing aspect of this musical. This approach, quite frankly, just did not work.Now...add onto this questionable CGI (I'm being kind), a languid pace (I'm being kind) and performers who were miscast (I'm looking at you Idris Elba, Rebel Wilson, Ray Winstone and...if I'm being honest...Ian McKellan and Judy Dench), and don't get me started on Jason Derullo's RumTum Tugger and Taylor Swift's Bumbalurna (really?) - they were just plain awful. Derullo, especially, turned a fun, energizing driving character into a boring embodiment of all that is wrong with this film (okay...Rebel Wilson was worse, but still....) the only players in this film that kept my attention were stage performers like Robbie Fairchild (Munkustrap) and Francesca Hayward (Victoria) and they were sidelined for the most part by the bigger names and had their dance numbers eliminated and/or truncated.I wish they would have gone for the campy ""so bad, it's good"" style of filmmaking - it, at least, would have kept my interest, but the movie as it is, did not. I was happy when the ""Jellicle Cat"" was selected at the end - I knew this experience would be over soon.Letter Grade D2 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(OfMarquis)",Cats

Not to mention humans in Cat version is so creepy and sort of disgusting, all those singing in no rhythm is so annoying. Maybe I'm not that much into original score or whatever, I could endure the songs used in Frozen 2, but I couldn't endure those songs of this film.

66,tm-sheehan,Much better than the ticking the Critics are giving Cats,8,27 December 2019,"My Review Cats - my Rating 8/10As anyone knows who reads my page I like musicals and have acquired some knowledge of this genre over the years . There have been some woeful Screen adaptations of famous Stage musicals eg A Chorus Line (1985) Man of La Mancha 1972 ,Camelot 1967, A Little Night Music 1977 to name a few.
The 2019 Tom Hooper "" Cats""does not deserve the vendetta of bad press by so called Professional Critics who I think don't understand the genre of the film musical at all.
I'm taking time over my Review as I want people to see this film ,it will polarise some people . I went with my regular film partner and he didn't care for it.I on the other hand enjoyed it very much I had read a little of the bollocking this movie is receiving and also a review yesterday from a friend who also knows the musical stage and film genre so I was so pleasantly surprised to be in the minority camp of people who praise this innovative reworking of a stage musical . Cats has already been filmed in 1998 with the original Griizabella Elaine Paige .If you want to see cats filmed in a studio pretty much as it was on stage the 1998 version may appeal more to your tastes .If you expect to hear the best vocal version of the hit song from Cats ,Memory sung by Jennifer Hudson you won't hear it in this version but her performance as the tired bedraggled and world weary Grizabella is the best acting performance I've seen of anyone in this pivotal role I can understand why her version is so full of pain.I notice IMBD give the 1998 version a 7.6 Rating and this new version a measly 2.6 ?
it's terribly unfair and doesn't give credit to the acting and technical expertise that has gone in to this production.
The 1998 version while authentic to the stage production doesn't expand the horizon of the wonderful world of Cats or add anything new the 2019 version does.Critics can unfortunately ruin a films prospects at the box office I hate the phrase some friends use "" oh I didn't go and see it because it got rotten reviews "" I always say make up your own mind I've seen so many enjoyable movies that the critics have panned and I've seen some very average films that some critics wax lyrically about.This new version of Cats directed by Tom Hooper ( The Kings Speech, The Danish Girl, Les Miserables) who also was a screenwriter with Lee Hall on this project features some great talent and magical moments . It's a very different setting to the stage production which was basically a big rubbish tip. It pays homage to other screen musicals ,especially Busby Berkeley and Mrs Henderson Presents. Dame Judi Dench was Mrs Henderson and that film was set in The Windmill theatre which also features in this as a set for Cats.
The rest of the scenes are in London itself in various locations like Trafalgar Square The Thames and a fabulous production number performed by Steven McRae as Skimbleshanks the Railway Cat on a rail bridge to a great London station.Francesca Hayward a Royal Ballet principle is wonderfully cast as Victoria the elegant timid White Cat who is dumped in the alley where the tribe of Jellicle cats are competing and waiting to be chosen to ascend to the Heaviside Layer and come back to a new Jellicle life.The plot is basically just that and it's based on a collection of poems by T.S. Elliott . Andrew Lloyd Webber's songs introduce all the characters like Bombalurina, Macavity, Mr Mistoffelees , the magician played so well by Laurie Davidson. James Corden as Bustopher Jones the fat cat in spats is fun Rebel Wilson as Jennyanydots is Rebel Wilson.
Idris Elba as Macavity the villain of the piece is also very good in the role.Terrific choreography very different in parts to the stage production in fact it's the younger less known actors that are the Stars of this film apart from Dame Judi Dench and Sir Ian McKellen. Dame Judi I think is wonderful as Old Deuteronomy in fact her final scene in Trafalgar Square moved me to a few tears. Ian McKellen is also wonderful as Gus The Theatre Cat and both these veterans of British theatre add great pathos and class I imagine the rest of the young cast must have felt privileged to be in this film.
I especially enjoyedIf I go to see a film adaptation of a musical I want it to be more intimate than the stage version and to transport me and inspire my imagination. I didn't like Tom Hoopers last musical film Les Miserables mainly for live singing if you can call Russell Crowe's voice singing but also because to me it lacked intimacy ,but I must say he has won me over in his latest musical Cats.Please Ignore the negative critical onslaught on this film adaptation of Cats ,make up your own mind . The estimated cost budget of this musical is USD 95,000,000 you can see every dollar spent in the sets and production numbers .The film is doing very poorly due to bad press and deserves a much better reception I hope for the sake of future musical films it does succeed.",Cats

72,CANpatbuck3664,"Cats is a Huge Misfire, Boring and Dumb Are the Words That Come to Mind",4,12 January 2020,"Even when a movie is just terrible across the board, I always look for positives. I've only ever seen a handful of movies where there weren't nuggets of good ideas or interesting decisions. Despite the design on the cats (which is bizarre but I got used to it as the movie went on), the production design of surroundings caught my eye. The movie does transport you into its world and I credit the team for that. I also thought there were a couple of decent performances, I liked Francesca Hayward as the main character Victoria, Jennifer Hudson is still an amazing vocalist as Grizabella and Ian McKellen was charming as Gus. I was also impressed with the choreography, Cats obviously had talented people involved and this isn't a case where nothing worked.That's most of the positives from the movie, the first negative aspect I wanted to talk about was the absence of a plot. Its easier to get wrapped up in musicals, they're full of pageantry and emotion. But you still have to tell a story and other than one of these cats getting chosen to be re-incarnated.....That's it. But you can compensate with memorable or interesting characters, maybe Cats has that up its sleeve? Another big swing and a miss. A lot of these characters get their moments with a musical number but do we learn more about them? Nope. One of my issues was that minus them being strays, what's so terrible about being a Jellicle cat? Only one of them is having a really rough time (the only other one who has an argument is Gus who's age is a factor). Let them go to the other side. It seemed like something that could be figured out quickly. That's pretty blunt but this movie drives you to that point.Getting to the rest of the cast, they range from the miscast (I felt bad for Judi Dench who kept being forced to sing when I don't think she could), to the underused (Macavity is continually hyped up but Idris Elba gets little time and little to do with that time), to the oddly picked (there was a lot of chatter about Taylor Swift but she's there maybe 5-10 minutes and while the performance is fine but just like her performing).I'm all for a good guilty pleasure film. But if I'm going to enjoy something like that, I want something entertaining or unbelievably bad. I would recommend Cats if it was that kind of awful but its not. It has some decent production design, some bright spots in the acting and choreography but that can't compensate for a lacking story, uninteresting music, weird CGI and poor characterization. Why isn't being graded as a 1 or a 2? I've seen worse (I'd still say worst of the year Holmes and Watson has it beat) and this movie didn't inspire anger when I watched it, mainly just boredom. I recommend you skip Cats, it belongs in the pantheon of movies that should have everything going for it (acclaimed cast and director, popular source material, big budget effects and production) and just missed the mark. Hopefully those in the production can just put this behind them and move onto other things. I'll remember this movie but not for the laughs, just the disappointment.",Cats
73,elicopperman,A CATastrophic Disaster from the Start,2,18 October 2020,"Last year, one of the most talked about movies was a feature-length film adaptation of the Andrew Lloyd Webber musical Cats. Directed by Tom Hooper off his smash hit Les Miserables, the film looked like oscar-bait magic in the making, but as soon as the first trailers came out, audiences were quick to judge how horrifying it looked. Unsurprisingly, the movie was not only a box office flop, but the critics trashed it to the point of hailing it as one of the worst films ever made. After almost a year since it's release and having seen it myself, I only have one question to ask. What in the world were they thinking?Right off the bat, the most glaring flaw with Cats are the CGI-felines themselves, as they come off so uncanny that they hurt the eyes. Unlike the original Broadway musical where it was actors in detailed cat costumes, this movie decided to go for a motion-captured realistic look of humans that look like cats, and the result is pure nightmare fuel. The designs are bad enough to look at on their own, but watching them move around just adds in to the uncomfortableness. Also, according to research, the animation crew behind the feature had less than a year to animate the entire movie, and one can tell since some of the compositing feels so fake and unbelievable. In addition, while the art direction and production design looks bright and shiny to some capacity, what keeps it from being special is how inconsistent the environments are in terms of scale, from bizarre objects to the height of buildings compared to the tiny cats. This is supposed to focus on cats, but when their sizes are all over the place, that's when you know this movie should have been fully animated.However, another major problem centering around the whole movie is its source material, because whether you love the original musical or not, we can all agree that the one thing Cats has always lacked is a cohesive story. That may be fitting for a play that's all about dancing and showmanship, but when you translate that into a feature film, you need more substance than just style and pizzazz. It doesn't help that most of the songs in the movie are basically introduction songs to random cat characters, from the obese Bustopher Jones, to the villanous Macavity, to the prima dona Jennyanydots, to the mischevious Bombolurina, to the magical Mr. Mistoffelees, to the admired matriarch Old Deuteronomy. There's a difference between exposition to set up the story and the entire story being exposition, and the vast majority of them don't even affect the already paper thin plot. It's really sad when I can barely even remember the main character she was so bland, and that's a sign of bad connection when you've failed to attract audiences to your focal felines.Now if there's anything remotely positive to give to the movie, at least the music is well conducted and the singing feels very reminiscent of the original Broadway musical. With an all-star cast of singers/actors like James Corden, Jason Derulo, Jennifer Hudson, Idris Elba, Judi Dench, Rebel Wilson, Ian McKellen, Taylor Swift and more, they really gave it their all through their singing performances and even dance moves. I'll even go as far as to say that Hudson's cover of the musical's most popular song Memory might be one of the best takes on the iconic classic. If you don't want to watch the movie, it wouldn't hurt to listen to the soundtrack on its own, even if you'll get the same amount of substance as the source material. And that right there highlights the biggest problem with the movie, how little of a point it has to exist instead of just staying on Broadway. Maybe once upon a time the musical had a chance on the big screen, but given how little there was to work with from the start, it's not surprising that the only thing to take away from this trainwreck are the songs and that's it.Not only is Cats an eye soar to look at with its ugly character designs and jumbled production scope, but it might be one of the most pointless excuses of a movie I've ever seen. When your source lacks a story, appealing characters and important songs to begin with, you're pretty much screwed to begin with. It goes to show you that no matter how popular a Broadway musical is, that doesn't make it worth translating into another medium like cinema. Outside of ironic enjoyment and possible die hard Cats fan screenings, this movie is better left off in the kitty litter dump.",Cats

I haven't ever been to a live show but I've seen the spectacular show on video time and time and TIME again. I'm aware that it's something to behold, an event devoid of any particularly defined plot or purpose. That's the charm of the performance, after all, right?Well, yeah. But that doesn't translate to a film. A group of human beings in cheap costume with low-grade CGI prancing about without a purpose on a movie theatre screen doesn't work. It's not a performance of the broadway show; it's a feature film and in that venue it fails miserably. The talent that was employed for this production aren't showcasing their strongest efforts, the main name (Taylor Swift) was literally put in to sell tickets to the movie; her character ultimately does nothing for the film.I really don't care that there's a ""new song"" or that there's a ""big budget"" put into this movie. All the money in the world can't take a concept that works good in one medium and make it into a good film. This performance belongs on the stage and on CD.

80,ebeckstr-1,Utterly the wrong approach to the adaptation,2,28 December 2019,"All right. It's easy to simply say this is one of the worst movies in a long time. I'll try to make a couple of constructive comments. If you've ever seen the filmed version of Hamlet with David Tennant or the filmed version of Death of a Salesman with Dustin Hoffman, that is the way Cats should have been adapted to the screen if they were going to do it live action. It should have been a filmed stage production with maybe a couple of cinematic flourishes such as some close-ups, and normal stage costumes, not CG. Or they could have made a fully animated version, that would have worked as well. Aside from all the technical errors related to scale - the cats vary in size literally from one shot to the next - and other technical errors like Judi Dench's wedding ring clearly visible because her hands weren't CG'd properly - the story itself is gibberish. I have never seen the stage production of Cats and had only heard one of the songs. I gather that when they wrote the script they tried to impose some sort of story where one had not been. They failed utterly, as this story makes absolutely no sense. That is to say, again, they simply should have adapted the exact same production to the screen and kept it simple.The failure of this movie is a really good example of how one or two ill-conceived decisions at the very beginning of pre-production can doom a project to failure no matter how hard and sincerely the actors and technicians may try to pull it together.",Cats

U
director: Tom Hooper
starring: Idris Elba,Judi Dench,Ian Mckellan,Taylor swift,Jason Derulo,Rebel Wilson,James Corden,Jennifer Hudson,Francesca Hayward,Laurie Davidson etcoverall rating 62/100Cats was probably the strangest film i have ever seen. But for me i oddly enjoyed cats for what it was despite it technically still not being a good film. Lets talk about why this is.First of all i loved the set locations and the tone they managed to create. The sets within the film were beautiful and very creatively made. Due to the accurate size of the cats all the locations were several times bigger then all of them. Which led to some very interesting and entertaining scenes involving many props from the cats perspectives. And the films strange tone mostly worked. With the sometimes calming music and surreal sets and visuals it almost felt like you were in some form of trance or dream whilst watching. Which i thought was really interesting and it was an experience i have never had before with a movie.I do have to give credit despite the strange performances everyone in the cast gave it there best shot and went all out with there portrayal of the different cats within the film. And everyone was cast well and worked well together with what screen time they had. However the two comedic performances from Rebel Wilson and James Corden didn't work for me. Its a shame as i like both of them usually when they are given the right comedic material but unfortunately they were not for cats. They felt really out of place within the film and none of there humour landed, making it awkward and even cringey in places sadly.My next two positives would be the chemistry and development between the lead character victoria ( Francesca Hayward( and Grizabella ( Jennifer Hudson) having never seen the stage show before it was interesting to see Grizabella who was shunned and hated by all the other cats feel accepted by Victoria who saw the good in her and accepted her flaws. But i do have to say the lead character was very bland for me and was overshadowed by better singing and acting performances. Her voice was decent but not great, She wasn't as much of a rememerable main character as she should of been. She was just very naive and was just following everyone around the whole film.My next positive would be some key standout performances from people such as Jason Derulo and Idris Elba. Everyone did a good job within this film. But jason Derulo bought so much energy and charisma to his performance he was a breath of fresh air when he came on screen. And Idris Elba was fantastic for the most part as the villain. He looked incredible with his massive fur coat and demon like eyes. And his character was very unlikeable showing that they did a good job with him.My final two negatives would be that the film had a very limiting and unclear plot, and that it was awkwardly sexual in places. Lets face it the film had practically no plot, aside from getting to know the different cats and there being a ball where one cat is chosen and thats it. This limited the movie to just being a bunch of entertaining musical numbers and nothing more, so sadly the film dragged its plot as much as they could to fill in the time but they desperately needed something a bit more exciting for the film. And i thought for a U rated film the film was quite awkward with how sexual it was. The camera was positioned awkwardly with Rebel wilsons character scratching herself. And cats tails were used in an interesting and disturbing way, I just thought they should of thought a bit more about what these scenes will look like to an audience member.However now i will end on my final two positives. The Songs and singers were fantastic. The film had loads of key standout moments. With some very fun and catchy songs. They made it a proper production with great dancers as well. And the songs were held together by excellent vocal performances, especially by Jason derulo,Taylor Swift and of course Jennifer Hudson who did a hauntingly beautiful rendition of memory.Overall Cats is the strangest movie you will see. And despite being a bad movie. Its very entertaining and is filled with great performances and fantastic musical numbers.",Cats

Comments around poor CGI, poor story and in some cases poor singing are common in reviews and after almost not seeing this movie I decided to take the chance. The actual movie was very good. The CGI was good and I did not feel anything was weird. The lacks of clothes and the suggestion of breasts on the female cats were hardly noticed and I wonder what the motive of the comments actually was. The story was clearer than the stage play and the music was excellent. Anyone who liked the stage play will enjoy this movie. If you don't like musicals and did not enjoy the stage play, then this movie is not for you. I would also suggest it may not appeal to younger viewers, although I could be wrong here.",Cats

Second Film of Choice at The Plaza Dorchester Tonight - Cats. I believe I'm going to buck the trend here. I loved this film. I loved that I knew all the words, that we got the sort of close ups of the cats that you never would in a stage show, enabling you to get the nuances of the characters, every twitch of the whisker every shake of the ear and every twitch of the tail. There was so much to focus on in every scene the film fair skipped along. I think the casting of so many famous people was a great thing. Who knows how many of them dreamed that one day they might play a jellicle cat, and with extended theatre runs being to costly in time for the actors we got to see people attack very different roles with gusto. I particularly liked Idris Elba as Macavity. Good to see James Cordon and Rebel Wilson portrayed as the larger felines and Sir Ian McKellen as Gus The Theatre Cat was very moving. My favourite song has always be Skimbleshanks the Railway Cat and I was eagerly awaiting this scene, I wasn't disappointed, I have a passion for tap and to see that incorporated along the train tracks was great. At the end of the film I heard someone say that Dame Judy Dench was dreadful, the only dreadful thing was her costume, compared to all the others she looked like she was clothed in fur fabric. She was an old lady playing an old cat and it worked for me. A great score, glorious sets and some beautiful choreography, don't kill the messenger but I loved it.",Cats
91,nammage,Never Seen the Broadway Version,3,15 November 2020,"(There are no Spoilers, I always mark it that way..I've never seen ""Cats"" the Musical on Broadway. I hear it's a beautiful Operalét (Opera/Ballet.) Some here, in the reviews, have a misconception of what an opera is or isn't: such as no speaking parts, just singing. That's incorrect. Operas typically are primarily singing first, and spoken dialogue second. Now, most operas are primarily just singing but there are quite a few with spoken dialogue.I've heard a few of the songs before, such as ""Memory"". My point: I'm coming into this mostly fresh so I'm unbiased to those who've seen the Broadway (or London) version, and make comparisons between the two. They never are alike. Even novels to film are typically different from one another that, at times, the only thing in common is the name(s.) Same with actual history to film; usually not even close to telling what really went on but just made up stuff for dramatization and/or comedic effect.This film moves so fast, from one scene to the next, I had no idea what was going on. It was quite incoherent. I had easier times keeping up with weird arthouse films than this one. Right when I thought respite was there, it just hurried on to the next scene that was even more incoherent. There was no time to get to know a single character so I cared about none of them. Not their plights or even caring what they were singing about. And while there were minor scenes of dancing from what I heard of the original, and what I've seen in other ballets myself, it seemed quite missing in this.Overall, I can't give an honest opinion of this film and story because I only understand the concept and that derives from the little knowledge I have of the play based on the poetry of Eliot, which I have read but it's been many years so it's quite faint in my memory (no pun intended.)I will say this is not a 1/10 (and most definitely not a 10/10) because there is something here, a mish mash of things ready to have a coherent story put in place at some future date, perhaps? But as is: a mish mash of incoherent snippets of...something.)",Cats

93,movieman6-413-929510,Tom Hooper has less success with turning this musical into a movie.,2,26 December 2019,"Cats is a film adaptation of the musical of the same name. The film is partly written and produced by Tom Hooper, the director of Les Misérables and The Danish Girl.In the film, the cat named Victoria (Francesca Hayward) wakes up among the cats, the Jellicles cats. Every year in the cat world it is decided which cat can travel to heavenly low to start a new cat life. Victoria tries to have a chance to be chosen so that she can start a new life, but for this she has to compete with many other cats.This film adaptation of a musical is not as good for Tom Hooper as the success he had with the film adaptation of the musical Les Misérables. At Les Misérables he also had a story with characters and a suitable film set to work with. With Cats he really only has a film set on which various household objects stand up in an enlarged way to show how great something such as a chair or cupboard is for a cat.
The film also has no real story except that the cats are all trying to be chosen to start a new cat life. As a viewer you get too little information to be able to follow exactly how the story of the film works.The only thing to enjoy are the singing and dance work of the cast, but to hear the music you can just look up the music on YouTube. That way you don't have to try to follow the unclear story. You can't see the dance movements like that, but they also come across a bit separately. The entire cast wears a special outfit to make them look like cats with special effects. Not their entire bodies have been transformed into cats, because they simply retain their human hands and feet. The actors' faces also seem to be simply placed on their bodies with a sort of Snapchat filter. The creations of what the characters in the film look like, can sometimes come across as somewhat comical or a little scary for younger viewers.The singing, dancing and acting are also well done by the cast, but the unclear story and appearance of their characters makes it hard to take most seriously. The cast consists of famous actors such as Judi Dench and Ian McKellen to artists such as Taylor Swift and Jason Derulo. The best acting is provided by Idris Elba. He plays the villain of the story, who tries to eliminate his competition to have a chance to start a new cat life. Despite the unclear story and his ridiculous cat appearance, he nevertheless tries to portray his role in a serious and fitting way in the film.",Cats
94,themadmovieman,"A disastrous show of pompous and inconsequential gibberish, garish visuals and tedious storytelling",2,21 December 2019,"I've got nothing against movie musicals, director Tom Hooper, or even anybody who's a part of making this film. But goodness me, Cats is an absolute monstrosity. Garish, non-sensical, boring and everything in between, it's a pompous and pointless musical that plays out with barely a redeeming feature, proving one of the most unbearable cinema experiences I've had in a very long time.While I haven't been a big fan of Hooper's work in the past, particularly Les Misérables, Cats pales in comparison to anything the director has made before, failing on all levels in its pathetic attempts to provide even a semblance of fun, magical theatre, and instead staggering along through its repetitive and frankly tedious story on its way to a terrible ending that can't come soon enough.There's nothing positive I have to say about this movie. Les Misérables, for all its faults, at least had a degree of spectacle, emotion and drama, whereas Cats is little more than an experiment gone wrong: a horrifying Frankenstein's monster that attempts to blend modern cinematic techniques with classic West End storytelling.First, the visual effects are extremely offputting. Whether it's the uncanny CGI human/cat-like figures, the inconsistent and distracting scaling and sizing issues, or even the plasticky, garish look of the whole film, Cats is a really unpleasant spectacle. And for all of the technical expertise that clearly went into pulling it off, it all feels squandered on a misguided and painfully showy movie.Next, Hooper's directing is jagged and meandering throughout. While the screenplay is hardly a work of art, Cats lacks even the slightest bit of show-stopping stage energy, symptomatic of direction that leaves the film wandering aimlessly right the way through.Hooper's visual style is uninspiring and unimaginative, the musical and dance numbers are repetitive and dull, and even the biggest, best dramatic set-pieces are completely missing any sort of real presence, instead just fading into the movie's jarringly inconsistent structure.The pacing is a massive problem throughout, as the film shirks the need for even a basic three-act structure in exchange for a horribly repetitive yet still inconsistent layout. Basically, for two hours, it goes like this: Dialogue, mini song, big musical number. Dialogue, mini song, big musical number. And repeat. Again and again and again.In that, Cats proves so boring, so predictable, and clearly so without life that it's happy to just sit and move you from one musical number to the next. A great movie musical should organically blend song and dialogue, with each complementing the other with the goal of developing the story wherever possible.Cats is so aimless and repetitive, that the pathetic excuse for a story barely seems to move at any point. Instead, it's just a vehicle for big West End musical numbers on the big screen, all built up to in jarring fashion that makes each song more awkward than the last.That story, too, is almost unbearable throughout. I won't pass judgment on the original stage show, but in the case of this film, the plot is non-sensical, the characters uninteresting, the screenplay unfocused, and the emotion painfully superficial.A little bit of fantasy is fine by me, but when a film is constantly repeating its fantasy mumbo-jumbo about cats being sent to heaven or something or other, it gives no incentive to keep watching, worsened by a total lack of character focus or even a consistent main lead.Francesca Hayward plays the young, new cat to join the tribe, so you'd think that she would be the main focus for the story. However, the movie is so distracted by trying to cram in as many A-listers and side characters as possible that the whole thing feels like an endless meet-and-greet, still introducing new characters deep into the latter stages, and not even giving a second to let Hayward's cat take centre stage.There's no story because it barely gets going. For what feels like an hour and a half, the film jumps between random characters' introductory musical numbers, and then, remembering it has to wrap things up in a two-hour window, abruptly shifts to tying up loose ends that were never really established in the first place.As a result, despite the immense acting talent on display, none of the characters are memorable, and none play even a leading role for you to connect with at any point. Alongside Hayward, there's Robbie Fairchild and Laurie Davidson, both of whom seem to be on screen enough to warrant a leading role, but neither even gets the slightest bit of attention from the screenplay.So, whenever their characters take any sort of role in the main plot, it comes across as sudden and out of left-field, a problem only caused because the movie spends so much time trying to entertain you with A-listers dressed as CGI cats. But even for all the Taylor Swift cameos in the world, it's surely not worth steamrolling simple character and narrative development.In short, Cats is an absolute atrocity. From a director with an already wobbly track record in the musical genre, this film is an utter disaster, failing to capture any sense of spectacle or fun, and instead meandering and wandering through a non-sensical, boring and predictable story that's seemingly used mostly as a platform for some big West End musical numbers and A-list cameos.There's nothing good to say about Cats, and unless you really want two hours of pain at the cinema, I suggest you stay as clear as possible.",Cats

In many of the Cats reviews people use phrases like 'fever dream' & 'bad trip' & I believe it's no coincidence.",Cats
99,chubarova,Strange,5,3 June 2020,"When I watched trailer of this film for the first time, I want to clear my eyes. Visual effects are awful, it looks very strange: humans with fur and tails but without any clothes. But when you are watching this film, from 25th munite you start to get used to it. It has a lot of good actors, and, of course, great music.
So, it's strange film that could be great.",Cats

102,Olicosmic,Lazier than a fat lazy cat,1,25 December 2019,"When I saw the trailer, I was confused as all hell, as I'm sure many others were. Weirdly provocative humanoid cats in a big musical? Uhh...okay. Then, I saw that some of the people who worked on Les Miserable did this, too, so that actually gave me some hope, considering how good that film turned out to be. Did this movie succeed? GOOD GOD. NO. First off, the story is some of the most padded crap I've seen in a film, as it's mostly about cats just wanting to find a mate, and pretty much nothing else. The end of the movie has some sort of plot happening, but before it gets any good, the movies over. Doesn't help that the pacing is needlessly slow for how dumb and nonexistent the story is. The CGI is just not good either. I thought the CGI in the trailer looked weird and creepy, but actually sitting through 2 hours worth of it, you really begin to notice how poor it is. The faces are weirdly tracked onto the cat bodies, and they're just not detailed at all. It all looked like 2009 era Pixar cats with real human faces on it, and it's just weird in an unsettling way. The performances, here, are completely wasted, as the sloppy writing hinders the otherwise fantastic cast, here. I can see some trying here, but when nothing lands thanks to the padded script and story, I still feel nothing from anyone. The attempts at humor are more often than not sad and cringe-worthy. I'll admit that the music is pretty good, but that doesn't really matter considering that it's all from the broadway, so I can't really give that to this film. This film has nothing going for it, as it's something that's not only stretched out unreasonably long, but also nightmarish in more ways than one. If you haven't seen this film, please keep it that way. It's not only weird and creepy, but it's lazier than a fat lazy cat.",Cats
103,TheVictoriousV,The worst thing? I am wholly unable to decipher who this fever dream is for.,1,20 December 2019,"A few days ago, someone on Twitter joked that the reviewers who had just beheld Tom Hooper's Cats on the big screen sounded like Lovecraftian protagonists. I tend to agree, as I recently read on Facebook: ""When you see these things switch between acting like people and acting like cats, you'll think you mistakenly read a page of the Necronomicon Ex Mortis"".What sort of dark, dreary mistake must've been made in our history that it came to the point where this... thing... was green-lit by a major studio? Who is this for? Is this what fans of the original musical want? Are kids supposed to enjoy it? Adult furries?Furthermore, what is it that is so goddamn difficult to understand about live-action remakes, especially the ones with talking animal characters? When we panned the Lion King remake because its photorealism subtracts the magic and expressiveness of singing felines, we didn't mean you should try doing singing felines in live-action AGAIN but this time with characters that are some sort of unholy alien hybrid between man and cat, and can therefore emote slightly more. What we meant, more so now than ever before, is STOP!Cats, as most of you are cursed to know, doesn't dress its dancers up in kitty costumes as per the original stageplay's tradition, nor does it opt for Disney-style CG animals in the place of actors. Instead, it sort of blends the two, giving us digital furry counterparts to Taylor Swift, Idris Elba, James Corden, Jason Derulo, Ian McKellen, and Judi Dench, just to name a few.I don't why digital adjustments needed to be done to these poor performers, as opposed to giving them real-life kitty suits. It makes us suspect that the dancing isn't wholly authentic (computers might have added some magic there), which is a shame since one of the leads is Francesca Hayward, dancer at the Royal Ballet, in her film debut. She has played everything from Alice in Wonderland and Sleeping Beauty, to The Sugar Plum Fairy and Juliet Capulet. She deserves far better.Aside from the night-terror visuals and accompanying cat-person noises, there isn't much to write home about here. If one can get used to the film's agonizing/agonized universe and excuse the possibility that we're not beholding wholly undoctored dancing, it's still pretty useless.The story (such as it is) is the story of Cats, plus some dumb jokes (thanks Rebel Wilson), celebrity cameos for generations Y through Z to enjoy, and other things that stretch it thin. The lovely but narratively useless songs from the Andrew Lloyd Webber production are there, plus some new additions to ensure a Best Original Song nomination, because that's what remakes and adaptations of musicals do, I guess. Hooper's Les Miserables film did it; the Beauty and the Beast remake did it; the Aladdin remake did it; now this.The best thing to come out of this film was a mashup someone made of the Cats trailer and the unsettling Annihilation soundtrack, partially because it was funny, but mainly because it confirms that random Internet users often have a more solid grasp of what makes a good movie and which images go with which mood than Hollywood professionals. Put some obnoxious Benny Hill music over the recent Rise of Skywalker and we have another example.Sadly, I fear the best meme material we got was from the initial trailer. Some fans and cineasts speculate that film studios are doing this on purpose; creating meme-worthy magnitudes of ugliness to help spread the word of their movies. There's even a theory that Sony's non-hideous redo of Sonic the Hedgehog was ready to go before the Internet had torn the initial design a new one; they just wanted the film to reach meme status first. That sounds a little too smart and 21st century-savvy to be true, though.",Cats

105,drunken_munki,Certainly worst of 2019,1,22 November 2020,"Maybe worse than that, it could be described as the worst big budget Hollywood production to date; for the estimated budget of 95,000,000 dollars, this offers the audience absolutely nothing other than unreasonable and unwanted horror.The CGI, for just being a year old, is shockingly awful. I remember for a decade now I have been teaching and speaking about how CGI and overuse of bluescreen is to be the death of cinema; and here we are. Not only is trash like this created by a team of completely clueless people who are unqualified; the production company wanted it like this. How can that be? Even Disney are remaking all their classics and turning them into CGI bluescreen pieces of trash that not only cost a fortune, but also strip out all the meaning and storytelling that the classics offered.Now then, this movie in particular is gross to look at. The cats look strange and creepy, the motion capture isn't quite right and the bodies sometimes feel detached from the heads. A team of performers and some decent costumes and makeup could go a long way, like as we have seen in some amazing productions lately. But we get some gaudy CGI that looks like some cheap knock off of what could be done 15 years ago with Pixar's 'Toy Story'.The plot is garbage, the acting is so poor. The music is awful, and none of the cast can sing. I can say that much, prepare your ears as well as your eyes.Lastly, this movie moves at the pace of mud, or at least as a viewer it feels like it drags on for 4 hours; yet only being 1 hour and 45 odd minutes.1/10 everyone in hollywood has lost their minds.",Cats
106,mr_bickle_the_pickle,A Big Ol' Mess,5,13 May 2020,"So one of the first changes is that the frame the movie by having Victoria be abandoned in an alley. She basically becomes the audience as we introduced to this world through her eyes. I actually didnt mind this change. Because I dont know if it would have translated well having the cats break the fourth wall and sing directly to the camera. They also change by having Victoria sing part of the reprise for Memory later on. In the stage musical, its a cat named Jemima. This also doesnt bother me that much since Victoria is the focus of this movie. Also, the are cats who songs are sung by other cats...whereas in this one...pretty much everyone sings their own song. Again, that change doesnt bother me too much. It's a small change and it doesnt vastly change the story so whatever.Now, I would say the biggest problem/disappointment with the film is Rebel Wilson. Which isn't a surprise because she annoyed the heck out of me from the trailer. I mean...she isnt the strongest singer to begin with....but she just can't play it straight. She tries way too hard to be funny (and it never lands) and she craps on the source material. They even disrupt the flow of the song ""Rum Tug Tugger"" later by having her interject for more bad jokes. Shut up Rebel, its not your moment anymore. James Corden is also not very good and felt the need to interject ""comedy"" as well. Theres one part of song where he lands on his balls.....ha ha...so funny *eyeroll*. Also, I didnt like his interpretation of the character. His character is a fat cat (in BOTH ways). He is supposed to be posh...so why is he dumpster diving. My mother tried to justify this by saying ""Oh but he's eating the finest foods though"". Like, him eating lobster isnt the issue. He would be the kind of cat to be waited on. He's not gonna jump in the garbage and get dirty. Then there's Idris Elba who plays his version of Macavity so campy. Also probably to expand his character (since he's in the stage musical for like a blip) they decide that his character acts out and kidnaps cats because he wants to go to the Heavyside Layer. Which......ok. But like they have his character kidnap several cats...and when I say kidnap I mean disappear into a puff of smoke. Like....the cats arent actual magical characters. Unless this movie is suggesting your cats have the power of teleportation....which wow. Also one change that scratched my head is that they change the arrangement of ""Mungo Jerrie and Rumpleteazer"". I mean, what was the point? What was wrong with Andrew Lloyd Weber's original music? Especially since it is such a fun song. I mean you cant even argue that that it was for a chance at a Best song oscar considering the lyrics are the still the same. So it was a puzzling choice. I should talk about the CGI. It does look better than the initial trailer....but it still look odd in places. I was also disappointed with the ""Mr Mistofolees"" number. I mean...it could be because its my favourite cat/number from the show. But its such a high energy dance number in the show and they dont do it here. You dont get this wonderful number of doing pirouettes and splits in the air and what not. They choose to not have Jason DeRulo as Rum Tug Tugger sing the song (who is surprisingly not bad in this). The actor who plays Mr Mistofolees isn't a bad singer. He's decent....but it probably would have been better if they had Jason DeRulo sing. But again, it doesnt make up for that with having some amazing high energy dance. Also, I should note that the film tries to set up/imply a romance between him and Victoria. Its weird. Victoria much like Mr Mistofolees isnt a bad singer. She's decent but she doesnt have the strongest voice. The new song she gets to sing ""Beautiful Ghosts"" is ok. My bigger issue with it...is I just dont think the placement makes sense. I mean she sings it to Grizabella right after her introduction song, in a kind of ""pip pip cheerio, keep your head up"" kind of way....and I feel like it messes up the flow since its not until the reprise of Memory where she is shown kindness.Positives, as I mentioned Jason DeRulo was not that bad. I dont think he's as good as the Broadway version...but he kind of does his own thing with it...and he does have a good voice. He's the best out of the ""A-List"" cast for sure. The best number out of the movie though is ""Skimbleshanks"". Its the only number that is like truly fun and I think really captures the essence of the Broadway show. Plus, the actor can sing and boy can he DANCE.But overall, besides a couple of things I liked...this movie is definitely a mess and tonally is all over the place. It doesnt know if wants to be a serious adaptation of the source material or if the actors are supposed to be in on the joke or what.",Cats
107,Avwillfan89,Exceptional.....ly bad,1,28 June 2020,"This was one hell of a movie to get through. Even getting drunk and watching it with friends was tough.It falls into the categories of broadway shows that should have stayed where it was created. This version of it felt like a horror movie. Intensely creepy, sometimes horrifying, sometimes intolerable, and all out weird.The CGI on the faces is particularly atrocious, as everyone agrees. And the close ups don't help at all. While clearly the terrifying cat people don't exist in real life, intense cult like environments, as depicted in this film, do. Being hopped up on drugs, forced to participate in strange rituals and competing in competitions in order to be ascend to a higher plain and come back to a better life (AKA be murdered) is something many cultists have performed over the years.This was definitely an experience rather than your casual watch.

This is apparently one of the most disliked films of all time which probably means it will be ""rediscovered"" years from now like Xanadu as wonderful camp! In any event, it's bad, but I have to admit that I saw this thing on Broadway eons ago and couldn't figure out what people liked about it then, and to be honest, the film is no worse than the play and I may have even liked a bit of it better. I thought Judi Dench, who I thought would really be out of her element, did a really good job. Actually most of the cast does what it can, though I did not like Jennifer Hudson at all or her rendition of this musical's most famous number. Steven Spielberg at one time was going to make this as an animated film and that is probably the only way to make it actually work on screen, though I personally would have no interest in that either. It's a piece of material that just leaves me cold and bewildered by its immense success on the stage.",Cats
112,blrnani,Very unfairly treated by the critics!,6,4 April 2020,"Let me be clear, I never really 'got' the Cats craze. As a child I remember hearing the poem and, like most small boys (I expect), being intrigued about the depravity of Macavity, who was 'never at the scene'.
Later the musical came out and I was enchanted by the beautiful song ""Memory"" and also liked that haunting background musical scale. So when i came across the DVD on offer I snapped it up. But it was still just a bunch of people dressed up as cats.
I'm not sure why a need was seen to use CGI to enhance the blend (Jungle Book, with it's weirdly disproportional animals, is far more deserving of criticism) and having seen the backlash and listened to Kermode I gather people have felt uncomfortable about the human-animal blend, perhaps seeing something of Island of Dr. Moreau in the result.
But for me it was still people dressed up as cats, but rather more convincingly than in the stage productions.
And taken on that basis it's then a question of how good one rates the individual performances, as collectively it worked, for me at least.
I found Francesca Hayward, on her acting debut, thoroughly enchanting and offering just the right amount of wide-eyed innocence combined with 'humanistic' core values. Her dancing was what you'd expect from a ballerina of her stature and her singing was convincing (in stark contrast to Ray Winstone, who must have been chosen because of his association with characters he has played previously).
I also thought the other dancing roles were very well done, perhaps due to the liberty of not having to wear heavy stage costumes and runny make-up. Taylor Swift, Naoimh Morgan and Steven McRae perhaps stood out most for me.
We know what Jennifer Hudson can do as a singer and actor, so it was no surprise that she carried the main baggage, although I was left wondering what a middle-aged Shirley Bassey would've done with that role.
Notably, for the first time I really felt I was developing an understanding of the story and why audiences have so much enjoyed the shows. Perhaps one of the Cats afficionados (as opposed to all the trolls jumping on the bandwagon to stick the knife in) can explain to me why they are disappointed with this film version.
It's only a 6 from me because this has never been 'my cup of tea', but taken on its own terms I thought it was just fine and it particularly pains me to see such vicious attacks on young artists who dedicated themselves to the project and turned in good performances.
If the project itself was misguided, that's a different matter altogether. People who say they felt uncomfortable should perhaps be asking themselves why. It's always been people dressing up as cats, but the people element has also been essential, for them to be able to sing and dance and express human emotions as well as 'catty' ones - it is a musical show, after all!",Cats

(The other one was for the brilliant Rebel Wilson, the only joy in the movie)
So, why did it bomb and why did I rate it so low? Easy...it's a dire film.
The music is appalling and there's nothing at all to sing along to and no catchy tunes whatsoever. That's a big fail for a musical. The 'lyrics are boring and uninspiring and tbh half the time I could not make them out anyway.
The acting is appalling. I honestly thought Francesca Hayward's 'character' had a rigid face for the first half hour as hers never changed. You can tell she's a ballerina but her posh poses had no place as a cat. She should have been taught to dumb down her posing.
The CGI wasn't very good. The sets all looked as if they were going to be great but had not yet been finished off. The very human faces were too human, they were human faces on cats' bodies, bizarre. They should have cat-ised the faces so that they suited the bodies. And boobs on cats??? Rebel is a big lass, they should have dealt with her breasts in CGI to make them more cat like.
Finally, the story was crap. It was long and drawn out at the start and then amounted to nothing.
I admit I didn't watch the final part (maybe 20 mins or so) I honestly just couldn't bare it any longer.

121,eelen-seth,A claw-fully ambitious cat-astrophe!,3,20 December 2019,"Tom Hooper, best known for his Oscar-winning film version of the smash hit musical 'Les Misérables', has made an oddly mesmerising big screen version of Andrew Lloyd Webber's well known stage musical 'Cats'. With actors fully covered in what was supposed to look like realistic CGI-fur, its paper thin story and horrifying visuals are tonally and visually messy, to the extent of either disgusting you or push you into a frenzy of uncontrollable laughter.Each year, a tribe of cats called the Jellicles must decide which one will ascend to the Heaviside Layer and come back to a new Jellicle life. Just thrown out of a car by her human, Victoria is the newest cat in town who is basically our eyes and ears through this strange and peculiar ceremony, that'll drag us through the streets of London.Cats is surprisingly not a boring film, to which you'll notice your eyes being glued to the screen for the full runtime. Burned into your cornea, cats with human features, jazz dancing human-hybrid cockroaches and the unzipping of furs as some sort of costume change mid-performance, will make this the most bizarre moviegoing experience of the decade, if not the century. David Cronenberg couldn't come up with something as cooked as this.With a grand range of mostly well known actors and dancers, the creators try to reach a broad audience of cinema goers that might not be familiar with the musical itself. Ballerina Francesca Hayward, making her on screen debut as pearly white kitten Victoria doesn't get a lot of lines, but impresses with her ongoing dance routines in which she literally floats (the visual effects looked so unfinished, you can notice a visible gap between their feet and the computer generated floor) through every scene. Oscar-winning actress/singer Jennifer Hudson plays glamour cat Grizabella, who's made some wrong decisions in the past and ended up as a sad and lonely stray carrying her wealth and fortune with her, hoping she gets to sing her song to impress the Jellicles, and fit in once again. Hudson, who's fur looked surprisingly combed, gets to perform the best known song on the soundtrack 'Memory' and so saves her own career by proving she's actually better than this. One can only hope this boosts her career like Dreamgirls once did for her.What's utterly frightening, is the fact all these other actors are giving it their all, making it even more of an out-of-body experience. Judi Dench breaking the fourth wall, by bringing a monologue to the audience in how to address a cat, will for sure make the entire audience crack up in roaring laughter. Rebel Wilson does what Rebel Wilson does, while R&B-singer Jason Derulo tries a British accent, and fails. Recently anointed ""performer of the decade"" Taylor Swift's part is narratively useless, especially when her character completely disappears from the stage, without any explanation.Of course the songs and music are as odd as the musical itself, with some weird synthesiser tune as part of the main theme. But one can't deny some of the songs are joyfully upbeat and catchy. Unfortunately, these songs are almost identical to the stage musical versions and aren't done justice by actors who can't really sing. Accompanied by some great production design, some acts look truly spectacular - such as a bedroom and dining room scene in which everything is larger than life. But Hooper thought bigger is better and destroys almost every scene with the overuse of bad-CGI, blurring what should look crisp and fighting Disney's ""live action"" version of The Lion King for the award of biggest cat-astrophe. Cats is claw-fully ambitious and doesn't kitten around. This tail of forgiveness and redemption had lots of paw-sibilities, but un-fur-tunately is nothing more than a hiss-terical fail of incomprehensible proportions.",Cats

It just sounded like an odd experience, people also forget just how odd the idea is anyway, that said I don't know how much this truly connects to the original stage production. Having said that, the choices made in this film are so bizarre. The CGI people/cat hybrid is one of the most horrible decisions I've ever seen, they should have fully animated this or committed to makeup, because WOW it's just so off-putting. The movie is also oddly horny and doesn't really contain a plot structure, it's more like HERES THIS CAT AND HERES THERE SONG, which can work on stage but not in a feature film. This is quite odd because Todd Hooper is a good filmmaker and it just boggles my mind as to why he would make this.

Directed by Tom Hooper. Written by Tom Hooper and Lee Hall
I finally broke down and watched it. One of the most talked about movies for all the wrong reasons. It is an adaptation of a long running award winning Broadway play. It is a musical where the songs don't seem to leave a lasting impression. That's like a comedy with no laughs or a horror film that isn't scary.I knew what I was getting into. I've seen the reviews. I've seen the trailers. I cringed and I cowered in fear. No time like the quarantine to see what this film had in store. Humanoid cat monsters changing size and weird camera angles and all the lovely shots of the fakest looking food ever caught on camera just coming out of the screen and going directly into my eyeballs.I have no clue who watched the dailies of this and thought yeah this is going to work like gangbusters. Give me more money. I can make something unique. Unique is the right word for it but I'm not sure it's the right usage of unique they were hoping for.There was no reason to make the cats CGI. None whatsoever. It was a case of could we do it but should we do it. You could have stuck with makeup and suits. It would have looked better that way. It was something done in The Island of Dr. Moreau. It looked marvelous in that movie. The CGI looks terrifying in this one. The human faces float separate from the bodies. The cats change size. The mice are humanoid. The mice are not just regular humanoids. They're basically played by children. The roaches are humanoid. Why are these things like humans? Not anthropomorphized but real life human versions of these monstrosities.Cats is a musical so naturally the music is the most important component. Cats has a myriad of meaningless casserole-like songs. Nothing stands out. Nothing at all. I could not tell you one song. I wasn't humming anything. The only reason I know Memories is the cultural impact it has. I know more about Memories from Jersey Girl than the actual musical it comes from. The performers don't stand out either.I would talk about the story but there isn't. It is a long series of introductions to characters we learn little to nothing about. The characters are essentially cyphers. They are merely vessels to carry some kind of tune. They are scary nightmare fuel singing and dancing. This movie is everything you've heard about and more. No amount of mind altering substances can help with this. It's okay to just let this movie fade from memory.... Memory... memory.I give this movie an F.",Cats
134,mitchell5954,A Tragic Misfire,5,15 January 2020,"Cats is a film I really wasn't looking forward to seeing. One reason is the immense negative reception around it. The second one is that I'm not a big fan of musicals as a whole outside of animated films. The only one I recall truly liking is Sweeney Todd. It's just not a genre that appeals to me too much. I'm especially not a fan of musicals like this where every line of dialog is sung. Though, I'll say it's more tolerable here than it was in Les Miserable. So, is this movie as bad as everyone says? In my opinion, no. At the same time, I can't say it's a great movie either.There's not much substance to the film other than the musical numbers, revolving around the most bare bones of a story. The film is about our main cat getting tossed onto the streets and is taken in by this band of stray cats immediately after. All these cats are competing in this really vague competition where the winner gets to ascend to this higher realm. It's not very well explained. Other than that it's just our character moving from one set piece to the next, and one musical number to the nest.On that note, the music is good. I can't compare it to the original play because I've never seen it performed. All the actors do a fine job in acting and singing, at least for me. There's some great talent in this film. The dance choreography was fine too. For me every song was fine, except the final number. The entire ending to this film is lame and unnecessary. The song is stupid, and you also have Judy Dench's character giving this speech to the audience on how to treat your cat; breaking the fourth wall it's awful.By far, the best thing about this film is the look, mainly the set pieces. I especially love the look of the city with how dark and misty it is. It gives the film a great dark and mysterious atmosphere to it.I wasn't as bothered by the way the film looked, mainly the characters, like most people were. Though there was one musical number involving mice and bugs, which are humanoid like the cats, which made me uncomfortable. I know if I were a kid watching this I would've been really uncomfortable. I think this should've maybe been Pg-13 rather than PG.Ultimately, I think the creators made the wrong decision of how to approach this material. This would've been better as a straight up animated picture. Then people would've felt far less unnerved watching it. In the play you had people in cat costumes because it was a play. This is a movie with $100 million budget behind it. They could've done literally anything, but instead just tried to recreate the play as is with bigger effects and set pieces.They should've made this a 3D, or better yet, a 2D animated film. This film would've been right at home back in the 90s when 2D animation was still prominent. There's a film from that time called Cats Don't Dance. This should've been made like that. I know Stephen Spielberg was going to make this an animated film out of this, but that fell through. That probably would've been better.Also the main villain played Macavity played by Idris Alba was really lame. Throughout this entire movie he's built-up as this crazy villain. He even has a song dedicated to hyping him up. Not only are his motivations unclear, but he's foiled super easily.Overall, Cats is an example that not all plays can be translated to film, at least not in the way they did it. The music and set pieces are good, and everyone gives a good performance. However, there's no real plot, the villain is weak, and the ending is lame. Again, this would've been better appreciated if this had just been an animated film.",Cats

136,bluepink,Prisoners should be forced to watch this as a form of torture.,1,10 August 2020,"1. No discernible storyline. This is the main issue. In particular, there was no noticeable three-act structure - so it felt like they were just singing and dancing for no reason, on a loop. So irritating. It also quickly became boring.2. Lack of clarity. For example, it was frustrating how they kept singing about ""Jellicle Cats"", but it was never made clear what that was. (Although admittedly, I turned it off halfway before finding out).
I feel that more spoken dialogue could have possibly helped to alleviate this issue. And hence, I don't think that Cats is the type of show that works as a movie.3. Visuals needed work. It quickly became apparent that they look weird (half human & half animal). And a lot of their movement looked unnatural or wrong e.g. they kinda look naked; and whenever they jumped around (which they did a lot) the cgi was always off.To conclude...It's a shame because some dance segments were good & there are a lot of talented people. It had potential, but it fell flat. It's not in the 'so bad it's good' category. It's just bad.",Cats

Cats pushes those effects right off a cliff into the uncanny valley. The design and look is freakin disgusting.I never saw the stage musical, so I didn't know what I was in for. This movie that has no plot, it's just a bunch of random cats introducing themselves.

Well its based off the neatly 40 yr old musical of huge success which was based on a book of poems about cats by T.S.Eliot.The songs and story are similar to the show with the odd change. The stage show follows a 50s jazz theme with balads inbetween.I guess the problem here is for a modern cinematic production it is a little bit dated, They could have updated the score a little whole keeping the lyrics and the familiriaty with the poems.The dance numbers were quite bland and static , almost solo pieces rather than great musical ensembles.Visually the CGI cats were fine, maybe strange but similar to the stage show, The backdrops were bland mainly blurry and everything had this sickly pink tinge to it regardless of night day or lighting.The story, as is the stage show quite bland yet somehow it gets more bland, more meandering and less interesting here, on top of that the performances seem vague and distant and there is little character connection or actor connection ( did everyone perform solo on green screen ?? )So while this wasn't a great adaptation it wasn't totally awful......

The actors were convincing in their characters. The harmonies were splendid. Jennifer Hudson performing memory was the only scene that really captured my attention and actually gave me goosebumps because she's so powerful.The beginning of the movie is weird and I got the feeling of the cat being inducted into a cult. Most of the scenes were so confusingly stupid that I couldn't try to appreciate the lyrics, and the storyline was incomprehensible.The CGI? I'll preface with saying I own a cat: I can ignore the fur, but the movement of the ears was distractingly unrealistic. The movements didn't match the emotions or thoughts, and certain ear tip movements...do some breeds have that ability and I'm just not aware?Finally, if you're going to CGI a human body as a cat, then why would you not complete the face?

CGI has come so far, so you'd think that would be good too. But somehow it just added to how terrible this is.The CGI is awful. The script is awful. Some of the songs that were great on stage are somehow awful. The blame lies with whoever decided not to animate this and went with CGI instead.I have never seen so many famous names in a cast and thought wow, this was a pile of poop.Wait for it on Netflix for free, it's that bad.

It never has been and never will be, but all those people scoring it just a one! Come on people, give credit where it is due. Jennifer Hudson can sing, but maybe her rendition of 'Memory' this time round was not the best. Idris Elba was spot on as McAvity, and Taylor Swift linked up nicely with him for their number. But the showstopper was Skimbleshanks... making it a tap dance, worked so well, and the whole dance crew joined in to make this a memorable routine. And I quite liked James Corden's number: visually it worked beautifully.OK the sets were not great, but I have yet to see a production of Cats where it has been good. It's just that type of show. And Francesca Hayward was charming and beautiful to watch throughout. Nobody seemed to notice these things. It's still worth watching and with a cast like this, yes, definitely!",Cats
147,vinsond21,Feline good,8,27 December 2019,"I am not a cat lover, but i love musical theater. In 1984, when Andrew Lloyd Webber's new musical Cats opened in Washington, DC's National Theater, i went to see it for the first time not knowing what to expect. I was blown away by the music, the staging, the concept. Over the years, i went to see the musical on stage three more times. And i couldn't wait to see a big-screen version that can be enjoyed by one and all, and not just those who can afford theater tickets. Finally, my dream has been fulfilled and i can die in peace. Cats the movie is pretty much what i imagined the musical on celluloid would be, with its near-purrfect casting and excellent choreography. While everyone was good in their own way, some impressed more than others. My favorite number and performer is probably Skimbleshanks the Railway Cat featuring Steven McRae followed by Mr Mistoffelees with Laurie Davidson and original song Beautiful Ghosts sung by newcomer Francesca Hayward. Also delightful with their turns were James Cordern as Bustopher Jones, Rebel Wilson as Jennyanydots and Jason Derulo as Rum Tum Tugger. A lovely surprise was Taylor Swift who wowed as Bombalurina, proving her early doubters wrong that she could carry off that role. The part of Old Deuteronomy, played by male actors in the stage versions, was given to Dame Judi Dench; she who became the first female M in the Bond franchise also did justice to this dignified role. Haters who decided not to like or love this movie before or after viewing it will find any reason or excuse to hate it. As for me, watching this Cats on the big screen left me ""feline good"".",Cats
148,seige-hound,"A few good songs can't save this bloated, overlong and creepy 'children's musical'",2,30 December 2019,"For some inconceivable reason, this film is rated G in Australia, despite its creepy sexual energy throughout the entire runtime. There are several moments where the cgi-enhanced bodysuits become uncannily similar to nudity  to the point where it makes you literally cringe. One scene features Rebel Wilson splaying her legs open 90 degrees while scratching her inner thigh. I thought to myself as I was watching that any parents watching with their kids must be having some sort of panic attack, wondering if they walked into the parody instead of the G rated musical.The story of Cats is fairly straightforward, we follow a gang of cats called the Jellicles as they go through a ceremony to select the next cat to be sent to the 'Heavyside Layer' (sort of like Heaven or Nirvana or something) and be reborn. We are shown this ceremony through the perspective of Victoria, a white cat who is abandoned by her owners at the beginning of the film before being taken in by the Jellicles.However, just because the plot is straightforward, doesn't mean that its easy to follow. Imagine a path through a wood that is straight, but is covered in brambles and thorns, making navigation still incredibly difficult. That's what watching Cats was like. Many parts of the songs, especially the first song ""Jellicle Songs for Jellicle Cats"" while sounding good, are almost entirely incomprehensible. I only caught like 50% of what they were saying, as a lot of the voices blurred together or were overwhelmed by the orchestration.The reason I'm rating it 2/10 instead of 1/10 is that I did like some of the songs. Maybe 3 songs were nice to listen to, including the famous song 'Memory'. It is obvious that with the cast and talent behind the camera that this was something the creators were passionate about, but it needs be remarked that the talent was sorely misplaced. Cats, from what I understand, is not a musical that transitions well from stage to screen. You might be able to make something decent by trimming the fat and making it an animated film that is like 80 minutes long or something, but Tom Hooper tried to give Cats the Les Miserables treatment, by stuffing the cast with High Calibre Actors (many of whom cant sing very well) and giving it an epic scale that also pays homage to the stage production (literally the only reason the art design went this way). But Cats isn't Les Mis. It needed more treatment and a better creative vision that I believe Tom Hooper wasn't prepared to provide. That, and Tom Hooper, director of Les Mis, the King's Speech and The Danish Girl, wasn't the guy to make a high-budget animated film. I don't think he knew anything about what he was doing, and with the apparent issues with the digital effects leading up to release (and afterwards) it definitely shows.I would be very interested in hearing about the behind the scenes woes that this movie went through, as they would almost certainly be more entertaining than the finished product.",Cats

152,helenbassett,Cats Film Review - Tom Hooper Directs Andrew Lloyd Webber's Christmas Catnip Cheer For Ballet & Musical Theatre Fans,10,2 January 2020,"I didn't love Cats the Musical when I saw it many years ago, but I loved the ballet and dance. Les Miserables had the epic story and Tom Hooper previously directed the Oscar winning film. While Cats had no story, I sat on the revolving stage, best seats in the house, and the show itself was full of musical earworms that are just as catchy 30 years later. Still no one could fail to miss the critical mauling Tom's Cats movie has been given, and my only disappointment was that I didn't get to see the original cut and CGI. I waited until a family trip during Christmas to see it instead.Royal Ballet Principal Francesca Hayward is the white kitten Victoria, an unwanted Christmas present who gets tossed into the back streets of London's Trafalgar Square. T S Eliot wrote his Old Possum's Book Of Practical Cats during the 1930s, and Eve Stewart takes advantage of the period in her beautiful production design, loved the Milk Bar, with fantastical cinematography by Christopher Ross.We follow Victoria as she meets the lovely Robbie Fairchild's Munkustrap, and the Jellicle cats who will compete at the Jellicle ball, to win the chance to be reborn in the Heaviside Layer. So maybe that 9 lives isn't true after all.Each cat competing will sing for Judi Dench's, now female, Old Deuteronomy. And that's the story, just following the poems. Some more enjoyable than others. Rebel Wilson as muiscal mad Jennyanydots performing with cockroaches and mice was a little coarse, although the mice were cute.James Corden's Bustopher Jones plays to his comic strengths as he dive bombs the dustbins of the better class of restaurants in London. But Idris Elba's green eyed Macavity is the cat determined to be reborn, with no obvious talents other than he magics the other competitors away. Two down. A stand out was the Royal Ballet Principal Steven McRae's tap dancing railway cat Skimbleshanks. The Railway Cat's taps matching the chatter of the railway. But he too is stolen away.Among the other cats I couldn't help comparing Laurie Davidson to Kate Moss's former boyfriend Pete Doherty. But Laurie's Mr. Mistoffelees is a sweet, friendly little cat who looks out for Victoria after she gets herself into mischief with Mungojerrie and Rumpleteazer. Danny Collins and Naoimh Morgan leave Victoria tied up in pearls when they are disturbed.With the cast of A list and new young would-be stars, the scenes are full of psychedelic colour, action and friendship, and into this comes Grizabella, the Glamour cat. An old squeeze of Macavity, she was beautiful then. Now Jennifer Hudson's Grizabella is like Phoebe's Smelly Cat. Unloved and unwanted. Victoria shows herself to have the making of a Jellicle cat when she attempts to befriend Grizabella, while the other cats hiss. For me Jennifer killed the standout song Memory, and not in a good way. The actual standout song instead was the new Beautiful Ghosts, which having heard Taylor Swift sing on the radio, perfectly fitted. But Francesca Hayward as Victoria actually sings it in the film. A surprisingly good voice from the talented young dancer.Taylor Swift herself is Macavity's new squeeze Bombalurina, but she better watch out she doesn't suffer Grizabella's fate, as she drops catnip onto the Jellicle cats. The feline minx. Game for a laugh Ian McKellen's Gus the Theatre Cat must surely have a particularly good chance of success at the Jellicle Ball. He deserves a second life. But that dastardly Macavity is still cat nabbing contestants. And they all end up magically aboard the jolly roger barge of Ray Winstone's Captain Growltiger. Very weird. If only there was another cat who could magically bring them, and the chief judge back.Cats is a song and dance celebration with choreography by Andy Blankenbuehler and little spoken words, except by the cats who aren't expected to be able to hold a tune. The dance has been updated with hip hop/street dancing by Jason Derulo's Rum Tum Tugger and Les Twins. But still the ballet and musical theatre dance are the highlights.The digital fur technology which freaked everyone out is yes a little weird, although I did want to stroke the cats. And I'm more a black Labrador dog sort of person. But then the original show had just skintight costumes, so this is just advancing technology. CGI has been a lot weirder at the movies than a couple of cats. I'm interested in the make-up challenge though as to how the faces were superimposed, if they indeed were. Very impressive however by the make-up team.Yes I loved it, much more than the stage show. And much more than most of the critics. But then I loved the stage show of Les Miserables more than Tom's film. And after each cat had taken his or her bow I wanted to applaud and sing along with the joyous songs. The cast gave it their all and I feel that James Corden was being dismissive when he said he hadn't watched it yet, but heard it wasn't very good. No doubt if it was a hit he would have been praising it to the Heaviside Layer and back. Well I cannot wait to watch and sing along at home.Regards Andrew Lloyd Webber, I loved both the stage show of Evita and the film. Madonna was exceptional and Oscar worthy. Now imagine that Starlight Express is set for Hollywood. A distant hope I fear now though. But no one sets out to make a bad film and this certainly isn't one.",Cats

It's logical. The more the critics and public at large denounce a vehicle, the more you are intrigued to see for yourself. Free promotion in advance. Of course the movie isn't anywhere near as bad as has been proclaimed.I am by no means an adequate judge and never having been a theatre goer as it stands. I enjoyed it and don't feel a bit guilty about it to boot. It was exuberant, connective, entertaining and good-natured. I never saw Cats in its theatrical incarnation, I was merely made aware of its gigantic presence and the phenomenon as the years rolled by and by. I dont think it was a particularly intricate or groundbreaking invention, more so I think it just struck a note with everyone and obviously had it's own brand of feline originality. The stage production must however, have been something of amazingly brilliant proportions, if the film adaptation I just saw shamed it so badly. A musical is something that has the ability to carry you away for a time, to muster one's stale imagination with the whimsy of song and dance and escapism.Its not Godard or Bresson or Eisenstein for God's sake, just let it be what it set out to be, a musical. In my humble opinion I had no qualms with the CGI, the costumes, the performances, the settings or anything else but then again I loved and was enraptured when I saw Lucille Ball in 'Mame' some odd 44 years ago. Maybe I just appreciate the effort, the craft and the love that went and goes into the making of one of the medium's trickiest genres.

161,Moviereeeels12,Pleasantly Surprised .... Meowtastic!,9,20 June 2020,"Lots and lots of bad reviews on this one from production, effects and poor acting. I've just watched the movie with an open mind and enjoyed the movie from start to finish, runs very quickly, great performances all round, effects were great and the $100 million budget certainly can be seen on screen.
I'm not a fan of this director, but the film does deliver here, more due to an excellent cast of well experienced and very good young upcoming stars.
Younger children may find it a little unsettling as the cats can be quite forceful at times.

162,smiledaydream,"Good music, fun production, way overdone, kids stuff",7,30 October 2021,"I love the Broadway play ""Cats"" by Andrew Lloyd Webber based on TS Eliot 1939 poetry. I'm sorry for anybody who's not informed that it is a musical piece and not a story. Like some ballet and other dance there is no story to Cats! Try to get over that. ""All art must have a story if it has a collection of songs."" Think of how ridiculous that opinion is. Someone compared it to Nutcracker as music not story. Cats is a fantastic production when well done. As a person who loves the play, I don't know what to think of this movie. It doesn't feel as good as the play. It doesn't feel like good acting that was filmed. It's more about production effects than the music and dance. If you love musical theater or you want to expose children to musical theater, I would not suggest starting with this. But for the low cost of viewing if somebody likes watching this it's a bunch of cats running around along with some rodents and insects. Compared to the production I saw in San Diego, the songs are unfeeling. They are very professional. They are very on key. They are very produced. Somebody glued all the pieces of the songs together. 👉 I am starting to like something about this. They've been careful to focus on the lyrics being enunciated. Next time I see the play Cars the songs will be more clear to me. Now that I've gotten over the extreme production I'm getting to really appreciate getting to hear the lyrics. There is no story to cats but I guess they've created a story around some sort of competition. Ian McKellen is fantastic. He makes a better statement about this movie within the movie than any of our reviews. OK now it's really beginning to drag. The play was never a drag. Sadly I'm saying this is Taylor Swift is coming down on the stage. If she did this exact thing in the middle of one of her shows I would be entertained by it. But at this point, I'm just getting really tired of watching the overproduced cats. But it's music and your kids might like watching cats move around for a couple hours. And this is appropriate for kids by the way. I saw comments on the Internet about seeing crotches Nothing is close to exposure and anybody who watches ballet or dance looking to see what they can see is of course being juvenile. But that is a human behavior.",Cats
163,mmevanille-53097,"Must be viewed as a performance, not a story",5,5 February 2020,"I really see this being made for the lovers of the musical, not as a stand alone film. My bet is that the majority of people who rated it 1 star, have never seen the stage show.You can see what Tom Hooper was trying to do, it just didn't come together very well. Don't expect a story, a plot or it to make any much sense.
But if you enjoy dancing, costumes and the soundtrack, then you will get some enjoyment from it. The actors did well with that they had. The CGI is sketchy and artsy, but not without its flaws.Even as a fan of theatre I had to skip through some bits because it dragged on. Plus I am not a huge fan of the show itself, even originally, although I do see its attraction.The biggest issue for me is this re-imaging is that there was no emotional connection to it or any of the characters. People call it boring in the other reviews, but why is it boring? Its because it is very difficult to relate to any of the characters, they don't seem sympathetic. There is no emotional investment But that is a part of the stage play as well.It just needs to viewed as a performance and not a story, and that's where I believe the majority of negative reviews are coming from.",Cats
164,Tug-3,Utterly bizarre,1,28 December 2019,"""Cats"" is such a strange film. If it had taken a much, much simpler, stripped-down approach, it could have been charming and sweet. Talk about gilding the lily: the filmmakers chose to pile on the CGI, and along with it a lot of unnecessary dialog and additional ""plot"" to this paper-thin musical. The Broadway show is a silly string of funny songs with one poignant ballad thrown in; the movie strains to add an actual storyline for no particular reason.To be fair, some of the performances are just fine, particularly Francesca Hayward, who does a marvelous job with her songs and is wonderful to behold in her dance scenes. Those bright spots are few, though, with truly awful, broad, unfunny vaudeville from Rebel Wilson and James Corden. Wow, are they bad. They act like friends watching the movie will be impressed, as if they're in a high school play and need to ham it up. Will Rebel Wilson ever star in a role that doesn't feature her constantly hurting herself, doing pratfalls and smacking herself in the face?A scroll through this IMDB page shows you just how many people were involved with the creation of this film. How much money and effort could've been saved here, just approaching the light, cute source material with simplicity.",Cats

When you don't expect much, you're often very pleased. NOT in this case! The lead actress (Francesca Hayward) was truly excellent in the role (and her dancing was beautiful), and Swift, Dench, Wilson, McKellen, Hudson, and James Corden are some of the most incredible acting talent around (and Wilson & Corden comic excellence!!) But OMG.. this movie was terrible!!! Beautiful sets, scenes, and great dancing couldn't even begin to save the hideous story and plotless adventure. It was a total YAWN-fest of boredom!

172,darrenbjones,Wonderful whimsy.,7,3 January 2020,"I really don't know why this film is getting so much hate. It's a fun piece of whimsy based on the hugely successful stage play of the same name.
Tom Hooper has put together a star studded cast, created a coherent plot that links together the various musical pieces and it's a great experience.
It starts off slowly but once it kicks into high gear, it's mesmerising through to the end. Just like the stage play it makes little sense, street cats gather to perform for the old matriarch Queen cat. She will decide which of them deserves to be elevated to a new life. Makes no sense but neither do cats in real life.
The effects are great and yes they are cat people, THAT'S THE STAGE PLAY TOO!!! In a world where we are happy to have Bradley Cooper voice a humanoid Racoon but we freak out about people looking like cats then I have to suspect all the fuss and negativity surrounding this is just false offence.
It's not got a huge amount of replay value but it was great and definitely worth catching on the big screen. Francesca Hayward was fantastic as Victoria, her dancing is incredible, Idris Elba was menacing as Macavity Jennifer Lawrence has some serious pipes. For me, one of the standout performances was Robert Fairchild as Munkustrap.

If you're expecting to see the stage version, you'll be disappointed. If one of the actors is a fave of yours, be prepared for something different. All the grumpy critics have already logged in, don't listen to them. They're a bunch of Philistines.This film should be called ""CATS: The Movie"", because it's very different from the stage show. The re-conception is brilliant. It turns a stubbornly stage musical into a film experience, an achievement that often doesn't go too well. All the elements - dancing, singing, visuals, storytelling - come together beautifully. Every cast member fits the template; it is very much an ensemble piece, not a star turn. Several players whose names you won't recognize (Munkustrap, Shimbleshanks, Mr Mistofelees) just simply dazzle alongside bravura work from the star names.This is well worth seeing.

176,YRLY59E,It's not the worst movie I've ever seen...,2,31 December 2019,"It's just very very bad. It's a poor movie adaptation of a musical.Imagine a high school doing a play. They decide to put on Cats. They have some hipster young pseudo progressive music teacher who has never taught, choreographed or put a play together before decide to attempt to reimagine Cats. Then it was filmed. This is the end result.I think they already made a comedy movie about this type of thing being done. It's called Hamlet 2. Watch that instead at least it's funny.The CGI isn't as bad as some make it out to be. This isn't something like the upcoming Sonic movie though where it can simply be fixed with CGI being redone. That's not the problem here. The general outline of Cats has been changed. The choreography reminds me of the ""Indian Thriller"" Golimar song from the Bollywood movie Donga. It's kinda like Michael Jackson's Thriller except it isn't. Cats is kinda like a Cats except it isn't. It's a bad plodding reimagined version of Cats made by people who have no idea what they are doing. Where is the dancing? Why are cats changed? Why are certain thing arbitrarily added? Good question. I haven't an answer. There isn't any actual reason to change these things but they did.I'm not sure why anyone would want to see this other than morbid curiosity which is why I saw it.Take your money. Set it aside.-If you want to see Cats wait for some local theater to put on a production of Cats, go see that instead. It will almost certainly be better.-If you want to watch a musical made into a movie go watch Evita that's a better example of how it should be done.-If you want the comedy aspect of how I think this movie came about watch Hamlet 2.Do not see this.",Cats

180,mc1382,Pleasantly Surprised,10,27 December 2019,"When I walked in for my screening for Cats I felt a lot of things. Fear, dread, excitement and hope, pretty much the whole spectrum of emotion. When I came out I felt confused because Cats is not a bad movie. Yes, that's right, despite what you've heard Cats is an almost engaging mixture of weirdness, trippy imagery and a comprehensible narrative. I liked the music quite a bit (The production and arrangements really help), the actors bring a good deal of personality to their roles and the free moving camera work helps to really immerse you in this world.The movie was so weird, audacious, sporadic and fun that it reminded me of films such as Phantom of the Paradise or Rocky Horror Picture Show. While I could see why this would turn people off, I think it works decently well and makes it stand out as a cult classic freak-out. I think the elephant in the room I have to address is the CGI. While it does take a bit getting used to, once you do it's kinda impressive what they were able to pull off. Aside from some shoddy CGI here and there I think they did a good job. Taylor Swift's character has hands down the best musical number and sequence in the film, oozing with a good amount seediness, personality and illusiveness. Taylor Swift has always been an underrated vocalist and this film proves exactly why she is a great emotional vocalist. She understands the complexity and stages of her character within the song.While these elements I appreciate the film for there a quite a number of flaws that pulled the movie down. For one the plotting is all over the place and the way the film tells information is often too vague and kinda alienates the audience. If the movie slowed down a bit more and had more emphasis on dialogue, I think this problem would've been reduced significantly. The musical numbers and the film as a whole could've been cut down too as there are some overlong sequences. This would've helped create more of a narrative momentum and made the film as a whole more engaging. There are some characters that were unnecessary like Macavity. If you remove him from the plot, it would literally make no difference. This could be applied to James Corden and Rebel Wilson's characters as well kinda being used as the useless comic relief. That didn't bother me as much as the jokes they're saying (while bad) are supposed to enhance the campy, cliche, over the top nature of the musical. The ending of the film while I kinda like for it's balls to the wall fourth wall break, it felt a bit lacklustre and was a bit of an unnecessary inclusion.Despite these issues, I came out of Cats pleasantly surprised. It's one of the most experimental, weird and crazy mainstream films I have ever seen. The amount of mind-altering sequences in this thing is enough alone to warrant a watch. While the film at this moment in time doesn't go beyond decent for me, I still feel this film is overhated by a crowd who had their pitchforks ready from the start. I think this film is very brave, refreshing and bold. I do think we need more films like Cats and by God, I am glad that it exists.",Cats
181,mc1382,Even better on rewatch,10,31 December 2019,"Yes I watched this again, yes I liked it even more the second time. My mind wasn't paranoid going into this so I could just sit back and enjoy the movie as I knew what to expect. The film still has flaws mind you (for more detail see my last review) but the frenetic enegry, weird imagery and fun tone really immerse you in the insanity of it. The movie has a very loose plot, combines decades worth of culture (40s iconography, 80s cheese and 2000s melodrama) and is a homage to crazy cult classic films.All the actors give it their all especially Jason Derulo and Taylor Swift who's enegry is just infectious and undeniable. The constant at of different songs and moods can be overwhelming at times but once you submit yourself to the fever dream it's absolutely compelling. The set design really stood out to me this time having an array of different colors and spooky designs (reminds me of the Xbox games I used to play when I was a kid). I'm kinda a bit disappointed at the critical mauling this was subjected to (going as far as to remove it from academy consideration)I honestly think it's great that a weird, loosly plotted film exists on a mainstream level. As much as certain aspects could've been done better, I can't deny how much fun I had with this. Cats is one of those films where most people won't be on its wavelength (and that's totally fine) but for the people who are it's a glamorous ride from the heights of Heaven to the depths of hell.",Cats

I think the film was best summed up when my movie companion (who knew nothing about the musical) leaned over to me about a third of the way through, and asked what exactly it was all supposed to be about. I whispered that it was the eternal question of ""Cats"": what is it about and why does it even exist? The movie wasn't exactly terrible, but it was weird and discombobulating and creepy.It then brings us back to the greatest unanswered question in musical theatre history: why was ""Cats"" so popular as a musical? The music isn't that great, with no story to speak of, so I think many people's fondness for the show is as much misty water-colored moments of nostalgia as it is praise for the show. It's just not objectively a great show, and what was novel (and a creepy) on stage becomes frightening rendered on the big screen. If you want to see for yourself, pop a few fistfuls of whatever you've got lying around and have a whirl. My head is still spinning from the experience. I hope I'm not scarred for life.",Cats
183,Chance_Boudreaux19,Bizzare embarassement for all involved,4,6 January 2020,"It baffles me how this movie exists in the state that it does as surely, everyone involved must've known how terrible it was. The first problem is the CGI which is straight up uncanny valley and made a child cry at my screening as soon as the cats first appeared. The better options would've been either costumes or full on animation and the decision to do the CGI is plain lazy and baffling. When Tom Hooper saw the CGI he should've rushed back into the cutting room and thrown all of the footage in the trash. He then should've rushed to the nearest Hot Topic as even the cheapest cat costumes would've looked better than what we got. Furthermore, the lack of plot might've worked in a play but it doesn't in a movie. The whole story is just a bad song after another which introduces a new cat that explains why they should be offered as a sacrifice by the leader of their cult to be reborn in some sort of new life. You don't care about any characters and the ""Memory"" moment which is meant to be emotional comes off as unintentionally hilarious, just like the rest of the movie. I went to see this as I just had to see for myself how bad it was and it was just as terrible as I hoped. I can't fault the movie for being boring as I enjoyed it all the way through despite the songs getting very tiring. There were many children at my screening and I found that very odd as I would not want to subject my child to this film if I was a parent. Seriously, this movie is extremely erotic and not for children. The cats constantly rub against each other, hump the floor and there are instances of them sniffing each others crotches and spreading their legs wide open. Taylor Swift who is in the movie very briefly wears high heels for the sole reason of accentuating her cat legs to make her looks sexy and she uses catnip on the cats which I seriously thought was going to send them all into a frenzy that would result in an orgy. There were many instances like that where I forgot I was watching a PG movie. If the movie doesn't turn children into furries down the line, it is sure to give them nightmares, especially when they see the CGI mice with human faces which will go down in history as one of the scariest creatures created in film. All in all, I can't give this movie anything less than a 5 because it entertained me too much and there were many times when I wanted to burst out laughing. That could be because this mess of a bizarre movie was making me insane but this piece of utter schlock must be seen to be believed and it will go down in history as one of the weirdest big budget productions of all time.",Cats

I had low expectations when I entered the theater...and I walked out lower! The main drawing card to the film was Taylor Swift, her performance was okay? The film wasn't very pleasing to watch, not a result of the acting, but from the animation. The animation and repeated choreography (the same basic choreography from the first minute to end) got old really quick.
The film was not the worst ever made. The film did have a good soundtrack, the repeated and annoying choreography/cinematography got in the way, unfortunately. It was also a shock that their are two lines of spoken dialogue in the entire film. It was hard to separate the different songs (they all bled together), it was closer to an opera than a musical.

The designs are beautiful, the perfect blend of realness to believe it in modern film world while not going too over the top & keeping the people's features. I never saw the show before this, so can't speak to the adaptation aspect of it; but it seems a lot of people hated this ultra successful show and hated the film adaptation of it following similar paths of supposedly dumbing it down for a broader appeal. Don't get me wrong: it's not a great movie, but it is (for a limited audience that will find it beautiful) memorable and worth a watch. Performances by James Corbin, Judi Dench, Ian Mckellen & another amazing performance by Jennifer Hudson is worth the price of admission alone. There's not much plot and it runs a bit too long, but has many strong moments. Does not deserve the 2.7 outta 10 it has on IMDB or the 30 of 100 it has by critics.

Then I watched it at 7:40PM, New Years Eve, alone in an auditorium in one of the most popular theaters in Santa Monica, CA. Enough about me.
This movie is pure cinema, without the mechanics that make theatrical productions happen. Cuts are very frequent and the camera is everywhere. There are song and dance numbers with special effect mice and cockroaches (the cats find them fascinating but hardly ever kill them). Sir Ian and Dame Judith perform, and Ms. Swift appears to have co-written an additional song with the original composer, which she performs. A story has been added, but the chaos of articulate tails, computer generated London, and a multitude of other elements that only movies have, pretty much dominate.

It's a musical about Cats that has honestly defied all logic for decades anyway! If you're a fan, I feel like you got what you were expecting. It was FINE. Not great, not awful. Fine. My biggest complaint was Jason DeRulo robbing the Rum Tum Tugger of literally everything that made the song and the character what it all was, but other than that, calm down. Seriously.

203,benm-41751,A musical with its life sucked out,2,19 April 2020,"Turning a musical into a movie isn't easy, but when it's done right it can capture the essence of the original in a way that can't be conveyed on stage. Unfortunately, this Cats movie is a musical crammed into a movie with all of its life drained in the process.The easy critique of Cats is that it looks ghastly, and it certainly does. But it goes beyond the unsettling human-like cat animation. Everything is caked in so much CGI that all the dancing and movement of the movie feels dampened. The colors are all washed out and the cats don't stand out from the bleak settings they inhabit. Sometimes I don't even know where I'm supposed to be looking because there's nothing dynamic.The awkwardness of the artificial fur coating hampers any funny or touching moment - it's like there's a hairball stuck to any sentiment in the movie. That's not to say there's much to feel... the characters are just props to eek out the songs one by one until the checklist is done. There's certainly no real story, which you can attribute to the original musical but isn't helped at all by the film. From the moment it starts you are tossed into this bizarre-looking and exceedingly unpleasant world of which there is really nothing redeeming.On top of the yucky visuals and flat characters, the camerawork is stubbornly rigid. You never feel pulled into the flow of dances or emotions - it feels more like a camera is set up to film a freak show for reality TV. It's almost as is the director is conscious of what a mess is taking place, but they're reporting on it rather than trying to evolve it.In my opinion, Cats is just as bad as the reviews say. But it's not just because of the initial shock of the way they've chosen to render the cats. Even if you give it your best try, it's difficult to watch this movie and find something to like.",Cats
204,suicidea,"A waste of talent, time and money",1,30 November 2020,"It's definitely not the worst movie of all time, as many people claim. However, I can appreciate the sentiment. It has zero charm, except the song Memory. I know the stage musical was an unsurpassed hit, and watching this you feel that it would indeed be a good stage play. However, as a movie it's a wreck.Upon the terrible early reviews, the director claimed he was rushed for a quick release, especially in the fx department, and later released an edited version. Honestly, the special effects are the least of the problems with this. I won't even go into the acting, the pacing, the lack of plot or story etc. My main problem is, why make this movie? Who actually thought anyone would want to see this? Honestly, why? It's not funny or entertaining, or remotely interesting. You could just stand on a street corner and look ahead for an hour, you're likely to see more interesting stuff than this movie. And that's not a smart aleck comment, that's the sad truth.I said I won't even go into the acting, the pacing, the lack of plot or story, but I will go into the photography. Not only is this a terrible movie, but it also ""looks"" terrible. The lighting and the sets are the worst I've seen in a long time. It looks like an 80's MTV music video set, and a very cheap one at that.A very weak effort overall, with a lot of money and talent wasted. It makes you wonder about the people in Hollywood, not only those who come up with these ideas, but also about those who approve them.",Cats
205,timrossminister,What's all the fuss?,7,24 December 2019,"I went to see Cats with very low expectations but came out wondering what on earth all the fuss was about. Too many reviewers have leapt on the ""If the critics say it's bad,it must be bad"" bandwagon - people do like an excuse to give something a good slammming.
It may not have the wow factor that The Greatest Showman had, but Cats is an enjoyable way to pass a couple of hours - just don't think about it too hard!
You've got people dressed up as cats, for goodness sake, if you think about it intellectually of course it's going to be weird. But if you think about Star Wars intellectually and critically, you've got sound in space which is physically impossible and light beams emerging from a battery and stopping after 3 feet; if you think about Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, you've got people defying the laws of physics because they're super good at martial arts. Cats is a cinematic musical fantasy and that's the mindset with which you need to watch it.
What's missing is an engaging storyline to pull you in and carry you along - but that is really the fault of the original stage show. And, to be fair, there are a couple of terrible casting choices - Idris Elba is uncomfortably out of place and obviously can't sing.
But the songs and dances, performed essentially as set pieces, have been superbly choreographed and cleverly produced. Visually, it is rich and fantastical with sets that have the feel of the best contemporary stage sets.

You have to see the whole stage because there are things going on all over the stage no matter which character the focus is on. With a stellar cast such as this you'd have to really go out of your way to produce a monstrosity like this. I'm sorry to say that that's pretty much what he did. I like Hooper.

And the size ratio between the set and the ""cats"" was annoyingly off. For instance, the mice were the size of flies around the cats, but the cats looked like mice beside a stove.Anyway, I did not like Phantom when I saw the stage production because I had no idea what was going on.

Seeing that this was getting especially poor reviews, I decided to see it in order to find out if this would become a new classic. This will go down in history as one of the most painfully unwatchable movies ever released by a major studio. Imagine if someone decided to combine Foodfight, The Garbage Pail Kids Movie, and Cool Cat Saves The Kids, and then added some of the worst songs this side of Grease 2.

212,wolfstar_imdb,"Sound and furries, signifying nothing",3,22 December 2019,"I'm not sure it would have been possible to make a great movie of Cats, but even so, this is a poor adaptation that dispenses with all the things that made the stage show popular. The amazing costumes and striking feline make-up of the original are replaced by distracting and excessive CGI that's somehow less convincing, the poor musical arrangements and instrumentation mean the songs sound much cheaper and tinnier than they should (how is it possible that this sounds more 80s than the 80s version?), while several of the roles normally played by seasoned musical theater performers are here filled by non-singers and non-dancers, meaning that some songs are spoken instead of sung (to their detriment). Taylor Swift and Jennifer Hudson are good, and it's their respective segments that comes closest to capturing the vibe this film should have had. Also fine are Ian McKellen and James Corden (who seems to realise he's in a bad film), as well as the central trio of Francesca Hayward, Robbie Fairchild and (especially) Laurie Davidson, even if they don't have much to do. Jason Derulo's take on Rum Tum Tugger unexpectedly falls flat, and it's not his fault - I wanted to see a fully-unleashed Derulo version of the character, but the arrangement and choreography are so tepid that Derulo has little leeway to show off. Cats is a dance-based spectacle, but the CGI overkill turns what should have been a theater piece into a cartoon.The inconsistent proportions didn't bother me at first... until I got to the railway scene where the cats are suddenly the size of shrews. And J-Hud's ascension into the cosmos should have been profound and moving, but ended up laughable. The stage musical isn't strong on narrative and characterization, but it has edge, sass and an artful 80s-rock sensibility that's totally missing here. While the stage show has energy to spare, this just feels listless - and there's no good reason why it should. It's not entertaining or fun, and never gives the audience a reason to care.",Cats

As I watched Cats, I kept asking myself, ""So where are the bad parts?"" After the movie I had to ask was this movie really that bad and could not really point to any mistakes justifying under a 4/9 so it received a 5/9. I believe the problem is Cats by nature is a silly concept and based on poetry. Add on to that music, singing, dancing, and many characters popping in and out of the plot and it is befuddling. I had the good fortune to see it on DVD with captions so I was able to replay scenes until they made sense and then move forward. As for the actors and scenery, compared to other Broadway/film made over the decades, they did pretty good as expected so that was not the problem. Again it comes down to the concept being silly and if you try too hard to overthink it; you will end up not liking this film. On the other hand, if I had been prepared with a better grasp of the plot and the characters, I would have given Cats a 6/9, because there are some good/evil metaphysical bits going on in the background that would likely show that Cats is not so silly.

Let's start off with the positives. Onto the negatives, the cinematography here is just headache inducing. Basically for the very small moments in between the music performances the cinematography switches to this extremely shaky handheld camera and like maybe they were going for the perspective of the cats but it just comes off as completely unnecessary. The CGI here is just awful, and these human cat hybrids taking up most of the screen just make things worse. To be honest, the movie could have some style with the use of color and some of the cinematography if it wasn't for the fact the subjects of the frame were these ""cats"" that did not blend in very well with their background. Moving on to the plots and characters... man there's really not much to talk about. This film just had so very little plot for an almost 2 hour runtime. There are these extremely long musical scenes that 99% of the time actually do nothing at all to advance the plot and then there are literally 2 minutes in between where all the cats do the weird crawling thing and our protagonist moves to a new area. Speaking of the protagonist, we basically know nothing at all about her until halfway through the film. The characters are all almost nonexistent, and I could've cared less if they were all killed by the exterminator. I was just so bored throughout the film because I cared about nothing that was happening, and even if I did the musical parts drag on for way too long and would basically ruin the whole thing anyway.Don't let the fact Cats has so little plot make you think ""oh so it's something artsy"". Artsy films like 2001 have a lot of possible themes that you can project onto them, and the plot there is clearly goes deeper into your subconscious to create a thoughtful experience. Cats does not do this. Cats has no themes besides don't abuse your animals. Besides, at least with films like 2001 and Blade Runner everything is done really well, in Cats nothing is done that well.I guess the music is fine but this film is almost entirely song and dance. The only thing that made this slightly tolerable was my brother sitting next to me laughing and making fun of the movie, but after he ditched me to go on the computer I was just disappointed. I can't think of any intentional comedy that lands. I won't bother getting into the whole thing about the fact our main character literally just arrived and somehow magically knew the moves for all the very complex and intricate dances. Overall, Cats had... a little going for it? Not really, the potential for good style doesn't matter because it was all ruined anyway. Cats gets a 1/10.",Cats

230,watcher101,It at least improves over the original.,4,24 August 2021,"Well, I finally ignored the bad reviews and sat through this, and what can I say about it? Well, it at least improves over the play. Yeah, the CGI was a disaster, there's no getting around that; they tried something, and it didn't work, and unfortunately, most people can't seem to see beyond that. But the movie and story itself, an improvement in every way. First, it actually has a bit of a story. The original play, it was basically one cat after another appearing and singing about their one defining feature, and that's it. This, while it does that too, at least expands on things and gives more characters actual character rather than being a one song appearance character.The story and character of Victoria and Mistoffelees are really expanded upon, especially Victoria, who is now the main character, as is their relationship, and Macavity and Grizabella a little bit too, giving more depth to their character and investing you in them and their interest a little more rather than them just appearing for a single song and dance, and then they no longer matter. Instead, they actually take part of the plot and the overall story and have more to do with things, especially Victoria, who even gets her own song and helps out Grizabella instead of just being another background character. For example, instead of Mistoffelees' song just being an introduction for and about his character, the scene is given more depth where he's trying to gain his confidence to save the day while the others support and encourage him. It also introduced him earlier and established he was magical back then rather than have him be a deus ex machina like in the stage musical. Little details like this go a long way. They actually do the ""show, don't tell"" rule for all of the characters to show what they're like rather than the play that only sings what they're like and doesn't show it.Of course, overall the movie still isn't much of a story, but at least it's an actual story instead of one random song and dance strung together by another for something that pretends to be a story like the wayt the actual musical was, so it feels like there's actual some kind of stakes or plot to follow. When it comes down to it, story and characterization plays the biggest part of a movie, and this at least has that with some of the characters, which the play doesn't (excluding Grizabella). In the original, the only character you really feel anything for is Grizabella, but in this one, you can feel at least a little bit for some of the other characters, which is an improvement over the play.Obviously, the movie was still a flop, and the CGI did not work out, but if you compare it to the original, it improves over it in almost every way, which is at least some kind of win. Not that I'll be watching either of them again, but I'll take this over the original any day.",Cats

A lot of notoriously awful movie musicals fill my guilty pleasure void, from The Wiz, From Justin to Kelly and Spice World to The Pirate Movie, Grease 2 and Popeye. Cats is one more scratch in that bedpost.One night every year, a tribe of cats called the Jellicles celebrate the Jellicle Ball, with their leader Old Deuteronomy (Dame Judi Dench) choosing one of them to ascend to the Heaviside Layer for a new life. What exactly happens once one moves on is left unclear, whether said cat dies on the way up above in a hot air balloon, but hey, it's a fantasy, roll with it. On this particular night of this particular unspecified timeline, a new arrival is abandoned by a human. This is Victoria (Royal Ballet principal Francesca Hayward in her feature film debut), a shy white kitten, quickly thrust into the world of the Jellicles.She is introduced to each prominent member of the Jellicles by Munkustrap (Robbie Fairchild) (a sort of narrator in the vein of the Bandleader from Chicago), from Gumbie cat Jennyanydots (Rebel Wilson), whose laziness is a front for her attempts to teach the creatures in her home how to work, and Rum Tum Tugger (Jason Derulo), a picky, self-centered rebel, to Bustopher Jones (James Corden), a remarkably fat ""cat about town"", the troublemaking catburglar duo of Mungojerrie and Rumpelteazer (Danny Collins and Naoimh Morgan) and the outcast Grizabella (Jennifer Hudson), banished by the Jellicles for getting involved with the villainous Macavity (Idris Elba), a master criminal with supernatural abilities. Bombalurina (Taylor Swift), in this iteration, instead of being a Jellicle herself, is Macavity's henchwoman. Swift's performance with Macavity's song is the biggest praise most critics have given the film.The visual effects are downright horrifying (I'm not entirely sure which version I've seen because I can't seem to find Dench's human hand), Jennyanydots removes her fur for a suit that's easier to dance in and she consumes cockroaches with human faces for no discernible reason. But I am a fellow who loves the uncanny valley, as well as the terrified noises of innocent audience members. Hell, my third trip resulted in my two friends leaving around the time of the obviously award-bait original song ""Beautiful Ghosts"" and then the theater erupted into a full-blown MST3K session.In no way whatsoever is Cats a good movie nor will it be any kind of award contender (except maybe the Razzies because they seem to carelessly give the award to whatever's the most hated), but, beyond the initial terror you may get within the first twenty minutes, you can have a lot of fun riffing it. Surely there will be others in your theater who have the same idea.",Cats

But the music and dancing is wonderful. It lacks a plot but has more of a plot than the musical.I walked away saying that was weird but enjoyable.

Andrew Lloyd Webber has been blessed with reasonable adaptations of his work (Les Miserable & Evita), but even he can see how wrong this is on most levels.Victoria (1st timer Felicity Hayward) is abandoned and meets the world of Jellicle cats whom stay in their own world singing songs waiting and wishing that Old Deuteronomy (Judi Dench) is impressed and makes one of them the entitled to rise to Heaviside (cat heaven). Confused?? Well it gets worse, there are cameos by Rebel Wilson, Taylor Swift that are excruciating. Then for James Corben just plain embarrassing.So why 3/10 we'll if it wasn't for Macavity (Idris Elba) and the tones of Grizabella (Jennifer Hudson), with Memories the only highlight in a really disappointing film, it would be a lot worse.",Cats

240,Whoopz,Please.. Make me forget!,1,31 January 2021,"I wanted to watch this movie with an open mind knowing its reputation, but honestly. The visuals are worse than I thought. I'm afraid I might get nightmares. Please.. Make me forget!",Cats
241,rolandjordaan2,The reason Siskel and Ebert both died were likely to avoid seeing this movie,1,4 January 2020,"Yesterday, I was sitting in a restaurant, watching people walking by; some of them seemed happy, some content, most just caught up in the hustle and bustle of their everyday lives...looking at these people, I could immediately tell that they all had one thing in common: none of these people had just sat through 'Cats'.
'Cats' is the kind of movie you go see before having a colonoscopy to make the procedure seem like a trip to Disney Land in comparison.
Sitting through this film was, and I'm not exaggerating here, the most painful movie-going experience of my life, more than that, it was one of the most painful experiences of my life. That time the horse kicked me, awesome after what I just sat through, all those bad Tinder dates, I'll marry any of them, attending my own mother's funeral not nearly as painful as sitting through this vile piece of cinema.
Now, I'll be straight, the stage play 'Cats' has never been a show that spoke to me personally and I have only seen limited extracts from the show itself. Yet, I could appreciate it. The makeup, the choreography, the singing talents, the casting...even if it wasn't my personal taste, I was still able to appreciate the enormous talent behind all of it and sometimes respect for source material means more than truly enjoying it. And that is what this film adaptation lacked severely, there was no respect for the source material it was based on.
'Cats' is a production that never should have been adapted to film, it couldn't. It has to be seen live to appreciate the on-stage talent. What this film brought us is badly CGI'd characters, looking creepy as hell, doing choreography that has been toned down from the show it's based on, with a whole lot of A-list actors singing mostly out of tune. Seriously Hollywood, you made this same mistake with Les Miserables, just because an actor is a big name it does not mean he can sing and viewing it is cringe worthy.
And that is what I felt for most the running time of this film, I was cringing, I felt uncomfortable, I was checking the time every 5-minutes, I just wanted this nonsensical. unpleasant, piece of trash to end so I could get out of there. And it took forever, the end of this movie felt like it was trolling me with at least 5-points where I thought the film was over, me jumping up and then it starts again - Cats, you are not freaking 'Lord of the Rings' and you do not get to do that!
When it finally did, I walked out of the cinema in a daze, I was ready to dump my entire movie collection into the garbage and to never watch another movie again, I was angry, I was sad, but mostly I just felt empty. Empty knowing that there are people starving in Kraaifontein and I had just thrown money away on this film.
I am going to be adding a list of charities below, please, think of them before you spend a dime of your money seeing 'Cats' because doing so is basically paying good money to give yourself brain tumours.",Cats
242,N-whymark,Rubbish and laughable,1,2 January 2020,"After all the hype and reviews we decided to see for ourselves what it's
Like. Have never seen the show cats so didn't know the storyline. Shame as the film doesn't explain the storyline either. Had no idea who was who. CGI was awful in places.

Wouldn't waste your time or money on it.",Cats
243,kaneeddy,A baffling film,4,27 December 2019,"This is such a weird film that has a lot of flaws and makes me question its existence at times, the CGI used is just awful the cats hands weren't even catlike at all making it look like the actors were just wearing some weird cat suits. The story is a jumbled mess that makes no sense and is barely coherent and makes me think if they took out the 20 minutes worth of celebrity cameos they could have created a decent enough story. This film like Les Miserables uses lyrics instead of dialogue but in this instance it just doesn't work. Most of the 2nd act was extremely boring and had me checking my watch, and I think impatient viewers will leave the theatre if they go to see it because of how boring it is.However I don't think its a complete dumpster fire, the songs (even though they were adapted from the original play) were nice to listen to especially Taylor Swifts song, also Jennifer Hudson has a part at the end which is quite nice and showed some promise but the pay off wasn't quite as good as what it should have been as they spent too much time messing around with the plot instead of developing a worthwhile arc for her character. I though that Idris Elbas character was interesting enough as well and thought most of his scenes were a nice distraction from some of the garbage shown. The production design was also very pretty and nice to look at giving the characters a nice background setting.Overall Cats is a poor movie and has some complete garbage in it like its absolutely awful use of CGI and presenting one of the most messiest stories put to film this year but it did have enough moments to keep me watching until the end.",Cats

Wasn't particularly looking forward to it in view of all the negative press but I'd already booked the tickets and guess what? I really enjoyed it. As a musical about singing cats it does a good job. It's lively and enjoyable which is what you want in a light hearted musical.As for the cast Judi Dench does a fair job singing for an 85 year old, certainly better at singing than a certain co-star of hers a few years ago. Of course, you could be arguing whether an 85 year old has the voice for it. The other older cast members, Ian McKellen and Ray Winstone do well. I'm old so I have no idea who the other cast were but they do their jobs well. I would argue that Jennifer Hudson overcooks "" Memory"" but most singers in this day and age seem to think that emotion means volume. I blame Whitney Houston and Celine Dion.If you're thinking about going ignore all the 1* reviews. It's not perfect but it's not the old dog that some say it is.",Cats

250,adog2001,Not Nearly As Bad As Everyone Made It Out To Be.,4,22 December 2019,"Okay, don't get me wrong. It's not good, but I don't think it was nearly as bad as others made it out to be and I kind of enjoyed it. Just came back from the theaters, and I am not gonna lie, the first half an hour is all but songs, no plot whatsoever. And after that, the plot begins the jellicle cat competition, which I found kind of interesting. Overall I thought the movie was okay and it got a few laughs out of me, plus I loved Francesca Hayward's character. Even though she is barely an actress, she has only been in maybe 3 movies now just as a ballet dancer in the first two and both a ballet dancer and actress in this movie, I thought she did really good as Victoria.
Another thing I liked were the songs, which were all from the original play, which i have never seen before. Only one new song was added in this movie and I believe it was Taylor Swift's song and that was a good song too. The actors did good singing them too even though most of them are not singers in real life.
The only problem i noticed was in a few scenes, you can tell a few of the actors' cats were not edited real well, and I noticed it mostly with Taylor Swift's cat character in one scene.
Overall, this movie is not good nor bad to me, and i don't think it deserves the 2.6 rating, i think it deserves more of a 4 out of 10 rating. I consider it an okay movie and not nearly as bad as people made it out to be. I give Cats a 5 out of 10.",Cats

I don't have to do that again but instead I want to point out that this movie makes me think of what the word bad really means. Sure this is bad, but it's also something else. I get the same feeling from watching this as I get from watching Troll 2 and Birdemic: this has been created by a twisted mind. It's not bad in the traditional way but bad in the sense of a piece of filth created by someone not mentally well.Another thing that strike me is that the awful cats look like demons out of a crappy c-movie. They just look and move like shadows in the background of horror movies. Once you see that you can't stop thinking about it. Its very disturbing.From time to time the stupidity and awfulness in this movies makes you almost hypnotized. In some bizarre way it makes you feel numb and in chock, unable to move out of your chair to switch it off.This is not something to watch for people who are not used to very, very, very bad movies. It's a film that could make you permantly damaged if you are a person that use to see normal and decent movies.

255,Silberfalke,"You might think I'm crazy, but I loved it.",9,15 May 2020,"First things first: I loved the stage production in the Eighties and saw ""Cats"" multiple times. So I knew what to expect ""storywise"" and also that it is more or less just a character run through in musical form. And I had zero expectations watching the movie besides ""you will laugh about it"" and ""you wanna like it, but like everybody else, you will hate it, once you've seen it""...Well: I didn't!The effects were bad, that is true, but I could totally ignore that and have a good time. I think I can connect to the vision director Tom Hooper had, creating the movie version of that once beloved musical.I liked the surreal scenery, the stage, the cinematography (I am serious), the choreography and, even if some acting was a bit shaky, some performances...Some criticized the ""confusing"" jumps from one stage to the other but hey: movie-musicals do that since their beginning and a musical fantasy (and ""Cats"" clearly was and is that) has all the right to use those tools. The scene with Skimbleshanks the railway cat and the temporary cut to an ""outdoor setting"" was beautiful (and would've been even better with good FX). And it was done before and will be done later in musicals (TV or Film).That the cats or the surroundings seemed once big, once small: for me that was not distracting, but an element of style that enhanced the surreal fantasy touch, Tom Hooper went for (at least it is my interpretation, that it was intentionally)The songs were good as ever (just the new interpretation of ""Mungo Jerry and Rumpleteaser"" robbed this numbe of its original qualities).Yeah, it had its flaws and one can focus on those and rip the movie apart, but overall it was an entertaining musical trip with a fair amount of cheesiness, but honestly: even the stage version is cheesy and fun because of that.For me ""Cats - The Movie"" was a psychedelic trip with beloved songs and visuals (visuals that sadly were obviously plagued by unfinished SFX)And yes: the oversexed way the cats were presented, felt very awkward at the beginning, but after a while I did not care anymore....Working with practical effects would've been a blessing. But it is how it is and we (my partner felt the same) had a good time watching it.BtwDon't take it so seriously! It is a musical FANTASY and what Jellicles are, well who cares. Maybe they are a cat gang on shrooms and the whole movie is a huge trip...Jennifer Hudson, btw, is totally into it. Never saw a such an emotional interpretation of the Grizabella character ever before... She's giving it all!I might be the only person in the world that loved and enjoyed it with all its flaws (besides my partner), but I seriously don't care.Thanks Tom Hooper. I think your vision for it was a good and courageous movie experiment, that sadly bombed. You will recover. And who knows, maybe in a few years, the perception changes in some other people too...",Cats
256,Habibi-Universe,"A Real Cringefest! By the way, why are some of the cats wearing sneakers?",2,10 October 2020,"Tom Hooper's 'Cats' (2019) is the worst musical I have ever seen. It really pains me that the director who made one of the best musicals of all time ('Les Misérables', 2012) now comes along with one of the worst ones of all time!'Cats' is a film that is hugely problematic on so many levels!
As far as the musical numbers are concerned, there are 2 good songs (if you count the outro, perhaps 3), the rest is completely irrelevant and such a waste of your time. The storytelling is basically just not really there, it's included in the totally forgettable, unspectacular and boring songs.It cannot be stressed enough just how stupid the entire film is! The concept of the story is actually quite interesting, it deals with the reincarnation process. The huge problem is the execution! The story can be found within the songs, HOWEVER these songs are mostly inaudible! It is so hard to understand anything and quite frankly, you just don't really care about anything because you are so distracted by the ridiculous look of the cats!This has to be one of the weirdest and most confusing films I have ever seen in my entire life and I have seen some really weird stuff, but THIS took it to a whole new level! Taylor Swift was a bit of a marketing gimmick since she is barely in the film. James Corden played the only cat who I found remotely interesting. While Jennifer Hudson's character was not appealing to me whatsoever, her musical and acting performance on the other hand was outstanding! She put so much emotion into her role (specifically talking about one song at the end) that I almost thought that I should care more. That's how good she was!As one critic put it (and I paraphrase), ""This is the worst thing that happened to cats since dogs"".
You know what? That's a great statement that totally applies for this peculiar situation!With that, I will come to my conclusion!
Overall, 'Cats' is a horrific musical that could have been much better, yet the film suffers from an identity crisis. It doesn't know whether these characters are supposed to be cats or humans?! At the end of the day, you see human beings in cat costumes acting like they're cats and it is horrible and very cringy to watch as well as really unsettling overall! 2/10",Cats

The Skimbleshanks tap dancing was also a fun watch.Now on to the negative as there was a lot. First off I don't understand the direction they took with the character design. They went so deep into the cat side that it looked weird. I actually didn't mind the old style or maybe more human. There was also a problem with their movements and dance as it felt sexual and there were times I almost thought some characters were going to kiss or something. I was honestly hoping for a good change as they could have updated the music to add more verity. I could easily imagine some of those songs in a rock, indie, or whatever than the same music that feels very 80's.I also hate that they even decided to add Rebel Wilson to the cast. Whenever I see her in any movie she feels like the same girl with disgusting humor and this is no different. There were also a lot of characters that didn't even sing well.

264,PradoCedric,"A nightmarish, abominable, unwatchable and disastrous musical film adaptation that brings the musical genre into a total disgrace and travesty",1,24 May 2020,"Like, don't know where to start with this nightmarish, abominable and disastrous trainwreck. Nothing about Cats really works as a film, which really justifies the point that not everything can be translated well into a film and Cats should have just been stuck on the stages of Broadway and West End and by making it into a film, the results are nothing but disastrous.Everything about Cats just makes it completely bizarre, unwatchable, grotesque, disgusting and unappealing. First, the CGI and its visual effects are utterly horrifying and atrocious, which sinks the film into an uncanny valley, given that much of the problems of the movie itself are laid on the decision to have the actors appear as cats through motion performance capture, with their recognizable faces being awkwardly grafted onto digital, humanoid cat models. Not to mention that the appearance of CGI mice and cockroaches within the film and its overreliance of green screen, offers the film no good and redeemable favors. Also, the looks and features within this movie also draws negatives comparisons of movies that are feline-related such as 1996's The Island of Dr. Moreau, 2003's Cat in the Hat, and 2004's Catwoman.Another issue of this movie comes with Tom Hooper's horrible and awful direction, which is completely shocking, considering the fact that he's crafted brilliant movies before, such as The King's Speech (for which he won an Oscar for his austere direction, with the movie itself winning Best Picture), Les Misérables and The Danish Girl. In Cats, his direction on this movie is completely scattered-brain, unfocused and thoroughly messy, with its generic coverage of marquee sequences which feels rushed and abrupt, inconsistent pacing as well as heavily chopped-in and metronomic editing while overly reliant on both close-ups and extreme wide shots; giving it no style or personality to the filmmaking. Worse, the live singing approach that he employed within this movie was pointless and unnecessary, while giving a disservice for the cast members who can't simultaneously act and sing at the same time.Third, some of the songs within this movie that were adapted from the stage musical (with the exception of ""Memory"") were utterly dated, repetitive, obnoxious and strange, with the rest of its musical numbers turned out to be cringeworthy and abysmal, and while some of these songs were celebrated in its prime; nowadays, most of these songs have entered into self-parody.Fourth, the tone for Cats is completely strange, off-putting, confusing and constantly jarring, which makes the film struggle of finding its identity, with the film erratically jumping from a comedy or an epic musical fantasy or a family-friendly genre, which makes the film completely odd. Making matters worse comes with the virtually non-existent plot, which sums up the earlier statement that not every material or medium can be translated into film, and this film proves it. With the absence of plot, it also makes it difficult for the audiences of understanding this film. Rather than expanding its wafer-thin narrative, Tom Hooper and his co-screenwriter, Lee Hall (of whom the latter is behind of some of the character-driven and in-depth screenplays such as 2000's Billy Elliot, 2011's War Horse, and most recently, 2019's Rocketman) doubles down on its thin storyline by playing safe and not taking boldly creative risk on the story and instead relying on its elaborate song-and-dance routines to keep the audiences interested (of which the audiences will get bored and uncomfortable of watching it).And fifth, comes with the terrible performances of James Corden, Rebel Wilson and Taylor Swift as Bustopher Jones, Jennyanydots, and Bombalurina. As for the former, he gives a deeply grating performance, with a lame ""comic relief"" sketch and a totally flat musical number, while Wilson was basically just acting out on a feline version of her usual shtick in the worst ways possible, and lacks the ripe singing voice to make it interesting, and as for the latter, Swift simply acts out in a pretentious manner and comes off as utterly distracting, not to mentioned that she gives a horrible British accent. Also, the comedy within the film, made it unfunny and cringeworthy. Furthermore, the supporting performances of Idris Elba, Ray Winstone, as well as acting legends such as Sir Ian McKellen and Dame Judi Dench are completely squandered and wasted, with the latter two simply giving embarrassing performances, of which it draws similar yet terrible parallels of great actors giving terrible performances in terrible movies such as Sir Patrick Stewart in The Emoji Movie and Al Pacino in Jack and Jill.However, Cats had a few redeemable qualities that stood out in this horrible mess. One of the most important aspects of the film is that it managed to nail the singing right, for which most of it was good, despite its horrible and distracting CGI. Of all the members of the cast that stood out, Jennifer Hudson gave out her scene-stealing and riveting performance as Grizabella, with her stirring genuinely stirring rendition of ""Memory"", which serves as a highlight in this dreadful movie. Despite giving out a bad acting and a bad accent to boot, Taylor Swift somehow managed to nail a good singing performance and a good musical number, while nailing the high-camp tone the movie seeks of. At the same time, the dance choreography is also strong across the board, in spite of Tom Hooper's lackluster direction. Lastly, the production design of the film itself is also exceptionally good, with props be credited on the craftsfolk working on Cats who put a ton of work into creating a tangible world, not to mentioned that its physical sets are pretty terrific for the most part, especially those which place an emphasis on the smaller stature of the cats, therefore having them interact with comically oversized objects, regardless on its horrible emphasis on the use of garish digital backdrops and green screen.But in the end, Cats is considered as one of the worst movie adaptations of a hit musical to be adapted, and probably the very worst ever attempted at this price point and scale. Almost every creative choice on this movie was utterly wrong, the visual design is a ridicule-worthy disaster (also being hilarious for all the wrong reasons), nor doesn't even seem to understand what made the musical so successful in the first place. Furthermore, it's also considered as one of the worst musical films to have been made, next to these terrible musical misfires such as 2004's The Phantom of the Opera, 2009's Nine and 2017's The Greatest Showman. Not to mentioned that Cats is one horrible musical film that brings the musical genre into an all-time low status, as well into a total disgrace and travesty. However, Cats has some potential to become a cult classic in the vein of The Rocky Horror Picture Show, even by conventional filmmaking standard is that Cats is an awful film. Yet, its inherent weirdness will ensure that it still wins its fair share of supporters, and will no doubt be screened on a regular basis on the midnight movie circuits within the next few years. Furthermore, the insane production of this movie will no doubt be talked in years to come (as in the case of bad movies like Jack and Jill, and Batman & Robin) and as horrible as this movie turned out to be, few are likely to forget about it any time soon.",Cats

266,TheRowdyMan,Dull and boring,3,13 January 2020,"Cats isn't just bad because of the distractingly bad CGI gaffs. While these did take me out of the film, the film's biggest problem is that it's boring. For such a fantastic approach to its character design, the film is painfully milquetoast.
There little cinematic atmosphere and other than basic dramatic lighting. It feels less like a musical and more like a recording of a stage production or a with better costumes.Other than the weird CGI, the cats themselves are either annoying or forgettable. Francesca Hayward's Victoria maintains the same bewildered look throughout the film. Rebel Wilson and Jeremy Corden's jokes are out of place and seem like a desperate attempt to appeal to a non-musical fans. A highlight is Ian McKellen, who knows to give the material a bit of camp and ham that it needed.McKellen aside, I had I hopes that this would be a secret so-bad-it's-good gem. Sadly, due to its overall blandness, it doesn't even work on that level.",Cats
267,ShanTeaTime,The Weirdest Musical Movie You Will Ever See...But It Will Make People More Curious About The Actual Musical,2,28 December 2019,"""Cats"" is a 2019 film based on the long lived 80's musical stage performance by the same name. It tells the story of a tribe of cats needing to decide yearly which one of them will ascend to the Heaviside Layer and come back to a new life.Alright so this happened, I saw ""Cats"" even after absolutely hating the trailer for this movie. I don't need to explain why I think the human-to-cat CGI is visually terrible looking, because it is. Yes the musical has strange visuals as well, but it works as a stage performance. Why? Because were expecting oddness, we know these performers are humans dressed as cats. The key word is ""dressed"", because I fully believe that this movie would've been a lot better if the team behind it just put them in costumes and prosthetic makeup like in the musical. It probably would've been SO MUCH CHEAPER too! I don't understand what the thought process was for this, other than to try and amaze audiences which backfired horribly. So were stuck with human faces and unproportioned lips that shift due to horrible MC, human hands and feet that levitate off the ground at moments and detached looking ears and tails. It's a mess.Moving on past the CGI because I could go on all day, I will say the sets were semi-impressive considering they were actually built. Which again furthers my disbelief as to how they built actual sets but chose to CGI skin-tight catsuits onto actors, but I digress. The musical only takes place in a junkyard, so this movie expands upon the smaller feeling scale of its source material which is nice. Also the story is quite loyal to the musical, and yes there is a story. Could Tom Hooper have stretched out the story to be more suitable to audiences? Yes, but it wouldn't of been ""Cats"" then. The musical is literally a character study, going through each cat (kind of like an initiation ceremony or talent competition) so we the audience get to know them through personalized song, rather than have Munkustrap (our main narrator) describe absolutely everything. It's interesting and each of the cats does have its own personality, we also get to see the smaller plot of which cat gets to be the ""chosen one"" and be reborn into a new life.This kind of loose plot doesn't really work in a film, which is why noone asked for this to be made. I still don't know who was the intended demographic for this film, other than fans of the musical I guess? The casting is well done (for the most part) ,however some actors were clearly cast just to pull in more viewers and not for talent or appropriateness. Rebel Wilson was awful, very unfunny and didn't embody Jennyanydots's character at all, whom is weird and quirky. James Corden was pretty bad too as Bustopher Jones, though not quite as bad as Rebel Wilson. He presented the character more on point at least. The last bad fruit in the basket of the cast in my opinion will probably offend many. I couldn't stand Taylor Swift's Bombalurina performance in this. First of all, she's shown in the trailer quite a lot because she's a huge selling point, but is barely in the film (one song's worth and doesn't even return at the end). Secondly, her song sounded terrible and I think it was the worst in the film tieing with Rebel Wilson's. I couldn't tell if she was trying to impersonate a british accent while singing, or if her tone was just all over the place? Maybe both! Lastly, her CGI looked the worst to me out of anybodys. So that just pushed the illusion the film was trying to create further out the window.Everyone else either did alright or surprisingly better than I expected. Newcomer Francesca Hayward did very well and I feel awful that this is her introduction into film. Jennifer Hudson killed it as Grizabella, though I wish she would've had more screen time and they changed her approach to Victoria. In the musical she's desperately trying to have someone touch her in order to be taken back into the tribe, but in this that moment doesn't happen. Which bugged me more than it probably should have. Idris Elba did well as villain Macavity and Jason Derulo was okay, he just didn't stand a chance against the live actor though in the 80's musical film. My favorite character portrayal was Mr. Mistoffelees though, Laurie Davidson did really well and I hope to see him in more! Everyone else was kind of just alright in my opinion, they either didn't bring enough character to the roll or I just didn't really care for them to begin with. The music was faithful and for the most part sounded good so oh well, though the newly added song I didn't care for because it stuck out like a sore thumb.Honestly, if you want a true showing of ""Cats"" just watch the 80's musical movie adaptation. It's pretty good and close-up so you can see all of the details put into the performances. This movie will probably garner some kind of following, I've already seen fanfiction drawings of Victoria and Mistoffelees. Which probably resulted from this movie surfacing and pushing that ""romance"" more into the light, but it doesn't really bother me. Tom Hooper has definitely become of those directors that either makes massively successful films that acquire acclaim or real failures that people hate. Which is fascinating. If you have a morbid fascination with this film, go see it! If not don't force yourself to, you'll want to leave and regret spending money on an overpriced theatre ticket.",Cats

Almost everyone who has heard of the movie and some who have actually seen it will tell you it is the worst thing ever created. They'll tell you about the look of the cats, the lack of a story. And even the terrible songs are the reasons they hate it so much. I guess I'm gonna have to go against the grain on this one because I enjoyed seeing it, heck, I've seen it three times. Maybe it's my bizarre taste in movies (for pete's sake, I love some of the weirdest films around, 'Coneheads, anyone?'), but I actually got absorbed in the songs and the world created.

Please do not ruin a magical show forever by watching this strange mess.I am not a musical fan to be honest BUT I do absolutely love the theatre version. It is super cool, both the set and the performers fill you with awe throughout! Songs are CATchy! A truly wonderful experience that I decided to happily relive when my local Playhouse put it up again a few years after seeing it the first time. It is that good!Then this film came out and I was quite excited. But this is not anything like the theatre. It is not even a little bit good. It is not even bad. It is beyond disturbing. What even are they? They are strangely human and not feline enough to feel like cats - but nor human enough to feel like people in costumes. Cats with weird peoples' faces and bodies but covered in fur and added pointy ears. If it sounds sort of fun - it is not! Yuck! Odd. Creepy. Not haha creepy. Just really wrong!I tried to watch the whole thing. I really did. Between feeling a tad sickened and really confused, I managed to somehow push through. Until they murdered 'Memory'!

273,mgentalen,I feel I was let down,3,21 December 2019,"Let me start, I have always been a fan of Cats. I've seen the Original Production at the Winter Garden, so yes, I was looking forward to the film adaption. What people seem not to realize, you can not adapt a play like this into a film. Cats, the musical, has numerous performers off screen jumping , moving etc.The film, is shot in a soundstage, nothing feels real. Idris Elba, great actor, but he felt off. Idris's character "" disappears"" repeatedly which gets to be both annoying and dumb. The way it's done feels cheep; like a Saturday Morning Cartoon in the 70's.There is a B story line where Idris Elba's character "" disappears"" with James Corden , Rebel Wilson & Ian Mckellan which felt vey awkward and uncomfortable. First, why did Ian look like he didn't want to be on set and was calling his lines in? James Corden, is not the right ""actor"" at all for this role at all. He tried to be to comicky. Rebel Wilson. I don't understand the likability, she and Corden had a Lucy and Ethel thing going which was annoying.There are some great number's. The visuals are poor, the acting is poor, and the sets are pretty tame in nature. Where did the 95 million dollars go towards? Green screens and a set? I left feeling disappointed, I was eager when I saw the first trailer, I am convinced Corden ruins every project he is in. Stick to just the Late Latte Show, you don't see Seth Meyers in Cats for a reason.D-",Cats

I have watched this movie 4 times, and each time I have only come to appreciate it more. Francisca Hayward, the girl who plays Victoria, is not even a professional actor and yet her portrayal is one of the most beautiful things in this already gorgeous film. The cgi is done masterfully, and the cinematography and choreography is stunning! Also the song that Taylor Swift wrote originally for this version of the musical adds a new dimension to the show.

275,arthurconnor,Not Even Worth A Few Laughs,2,26 December 2019,"It's been so long since there's been a theatrical, big budget disaster of this magnitude, but Cats manages to disappoint, disturb, and confuse at every single turn. As best I can tell, Cats revolves around a young kitten abandoned on the street who meets a variety of other cats before some big ball where one cat is named as the ultimate jellicle cat. This is really all there is to the film and it mostly consists of people you sort of know showing up, mugging for the camera, doing a song and dance, and then never being heard from again. There's also Idris Elba as an evil cat who wants to kill (or just magically transport them to another location?) all the runners up for the big award. Why? No one knows. Are some cats just born bad? Was he abused one too many times? Cats doesn't offer any answers of nuance and almost feels like you're watching a 3 hour movie that's had all the important character development and plot points scissored out, leaving us with a movie that doesn't make a lick of sense.Pretty much every actor makes a fool of themselves multiple times throughout and you wonder what made them sign on to this mess in the first place. I will give director Tom Hooper one thing - it looks better and less claustrophobic than his Les Miserables with wider shots and a bevvy of colors swirling around the characters in an attempt to mimic the inner city night life. Sadly, visuals aren't enough to keep one's interest in a story that makes no sense and featuring characters who are this one dimensional and flat.I'm afraid it's not even fun on a campy ""what were they thinking?"" kind of level like The Room or Showgirls.",Cats

283,mhthehammer,"God songs, but one ugly mess",3,28 May 2020,"'Cats' by Andrew Lloyd Webber isn't my favorite musical because, while it is visually brilliant and beautifully sung, the story is very light and minimal and the style is very dated. Nevertheless, the show was the longest-running musical from the early 1980's until the late 90's and started the long trend of family-friendly mega-blockbusters on Broadway. Based on a collection of poems by T.S. Eliot, 'Cats' the musical introduces one Jellicle cat, it sings a dynamic number and gets cast aside among the ensemble, rinse and repeat, like fashion models on the runway. As for Cats the movie, Tom Hooper gives an already incoherent narrative a plot so the movie would seem real to the cinematic eye. Victoria the White Cat (Francesca Hayward), who has no dialogue and one dance number in the show, is the main character who goes through a journey, I guess, but barely does anything to earn her Jellicle trophy. Macavity (Idris Elba) has more screen time than the episodic show as the antagonist who kidnaps other Jellicle cats: Asparagus (Ian McKellan), Jennyanydots (Rebel Wilson), Bustopher Jones (James Corden), and Old Deuteronomy (Judi Dench). Lastly, Hooper feeds the script with terrible cat puns on par with the ones from Catwoman and suggests an even worse adlib job from Corden and Wilson. The only redeeming value in Cats the movie is the song soundtrack, performed by giants like Jennifer Hudson and Taylor Swift. Even ballerina Miss Hayward produces a beautiful innocent voice in her feature debut to incorporate with her dancing talents. Beyond that, I'll forgive the hideous humanoid cat special effects, but with the story mixed into an already plotless musical, Cats was a complete mess. (1 ½ Scary CGI Jellicles out of 5)",Cats

286,jn1356-1,Competent to Critique,8,20 December 2019,"A medical doctor who belonged to a local church was asked to join the committee whose job it was to evaluate the pastor. The doctor refused, explaining that no lay people, but only other doctors, are competent to judge a how doctors carry out their profession.Competence in critiquing one genre does not necessarily mean the critic is competent to critique another. Musicals and science fiction have been areas of specialization of mine for nearly a half century, and I find many critiques of music or science fiction reveal not any defect in the subject, but the incompetence of the critic.When Andrew Lloyd Webber decided to translate T. S. Eliot's ""Old Possum's Guide to Practical Cats"" into a musical, surely his friends told him he had finally lost his mind (As if ""Jesus Christ Superstar"" and ""Evita"" weren't proof enough of that). ""Old Possum's"" is not a story, it's a collection of silly poems about cats, not great literature, but fun to read to little children. There is no plot there, no story. ""Cats"", the resulting musical, is wondrous and magical, not because of the story, but because of the brilliant music, the supernatural dance moves, the scenery, the staging, and the orchestration. Somehow, they added a gossamer framework of a story, having the cats coming up before Old Deuteronomy to see who gets to go to the Heavyside Layer for a new jellicle life. Let's face it, going from cat to cat, poem to poem, is a bit tedious at moments. Personally, I found Bustopher Jones and Jennyanydots a bit boring. It feels as if we're enduring those to get to the beautifully satisfying emotional ending.To translate the play into a movie, Tom Hooper has added another layer of gossamer: Macavity kidnapping (catnapping) other contestants for the prize hoping to have it himself. Having enlisted Judi Dench (Old Deuteronomy), Idris Elba (Macavity), Ian McKellen (Gus), Rebel Wilson (Jennyanydots), and James Corden (Bustopher Jones), he had to expand their parts at least a little. But he has had the advantage of CGI, which he uses brilliantly. I loved the CGI helping turning the characters into cats. It was excellent.The brilliance of ""Cats"", as I said, is the musical performance, the staging, the dance. Hooper has given us a brilliant musical performance, brilliant staging, and amazing dancing. The story, alas! is inferior. But that's not what I paid to see.Poor Judi Dench and Ian McKellan! When they're brilliant, I think, ""Ho hum. Brilliant again."" They handled their parts very well.James Corden is always charming, always worth the price of admission. He is again.Idris Elba, Rebel Wilson, Taylor Swift, none of them disappoint.But Francesca Hayward was a revelation to me. A sweet face, a lovely silvery singing voice, and (to me, an amateur at critiquing dance) some brilliant ballet technique. She carries the movie as the abandoned kitten Victoria, and she carries it well.Despite my fear of being stoned as a heretic, I daresay Jennifer Hudson was born to play Grizabella, and I would put her rendition of ""Memories"" against anyone's. Who but ""Dreamgirl""'s Effie White could properly render that magnificent number? It has never been done better.Final word: If you don't like musicals, don't go see ""Cats"". And if you don't like musicals and you go see ""Cats"", don't pass yourself off as a competent critic.",Cats

A deadly virus, the most divisive political race in history, wildfires, hurricanes, unending isolation and millions out of work. All because my roommates and I just HAD to see this trash heap of a movie. Could it have been avoided if we had just gone to see Jumanji 2? I guess we'll never know.What I DO know is that there is nothing remotely redeeming in this movie. The music (excluding Memory) is a grating mix of discordant leitmotifs and demonic-sounding chants. The visuals are a massively uncomfortable crawl through the Uncanny valley. Talented actors (Judi Dench, Ian MacKellan, Idris Elba) are forced to meow, mewl and hiss their way through the poorest excuse for a plot I've ever witnessed. The set design bears no semblance of a consistent scale (one seconds the cats are small enough to tap dance on a train track, while earlier they're as tall as gravestones).

We didn't expect it to be good, but we didn't expect it to be as unbearable as it really is. We walked into the theater to find only two other people in there with us. On a Saturday night. They left after 20 minutes. We tried our best but wound up leaving after about 40 minutes because we felt physically ill watching it. I can't even begin to describe the way this movie made me feel other than sick. The entire thing felt like a horrible fever dream and we just had to get out.

Its pretty amazing how it turned out thanks to our film technology. I will say, the CGI on their footwork was not the best. You could tell that was edited. But overrall Cata was not a bad movie, nor was the plot confusing. The plot is determing who will be the nect gellical cat. Of course theres a villain and you know that from the beggining.

303,courtneypedersen,Disappointing And Confusing,1,13 June 2020,"Let me first say I've never seen the play and I believe that might be the key to enjoying this movie. With that said, I did not enjoy this movie. I'm not sure if my expectations were too high or if I just wasn't aware of how nonsensical it was going to be. I was looking forward to watching it for a couple reasons: one of them being Idris Elba and the other being the music of Andrew Lloyd Webber. However, I kept putting it off because I am one of those rare people who finds Taylor Swift absolutely loathsome! I don't understand how she still has a career because she isn't that great of an actress and her vocals aren't much better but I digress.
This movie started off weird with a song that didn't make much sense and then went downhill from there. I thought it would be cute to see humans dressed up as and playing cats but it actually turned out to be quite creepy and unsettling. I grasped the main plot point of the movie was a cat would be chosen to be ""reborn"" into a better life but after 30 minutes or so not much more information was given about it other than why some cats thought they deserved it.
I'm not sure if the movie got any better after the first 30 minutes because I shut it off. I am not the kind of person to turn off a movie without trying to make it all the way through or at least halfway but I just could not do it. If you've seen the play, then I believe there is a good chance you'll enjoy the movie. If you haven't, then I would say don't even bother with trying to watch this.",Cats

This is based on the 1970s musical Cats which had fantastic dancing and music built around the story and beliefs of a group of Cats (based around TS Elliott's poems). Its is about rebirth, the importance of community and the pain of loneliness and loss. Yes this has a small amount of CGI that is weird because this is first and foremost a dance musical as the human body can do amazing things. The CGI moves were unexpected. But watching Victoria dance ballet was exquisite.Loved this more than I loved my old VHS of CATS. They gave it more of a story. They used famous people in very appropriate roles. Seriously, if you the musical, this one is well worth seeing. I would normally give it 7 or 8 stars because the intermittent CGI moves were unnecessary, but this movie captivated me. Having fell for the pathetic reviews, I rented this planning to listen to it in the background, but ended up sitting and watching it, entranced.When they announced they were doing this movie, I was surprised as I didn't think it would suit the ADD audience of today.

As much as it is directed by Tom Hooper, who is a good director, the direction of Cats is very bad, and the film has what is perhaps the worst break of the fourth wall in the history of cinema, I could not see anything positive in the film , even if I tried hard, I couldn't find a good thing in the film.",Cats

This musical film is very similar to the theatre show. The plot isn't that clear - you have to really listen to the words of each song to really understand what's happening but that is how it was always written. Ian McKellen makes an amazing cat! The singing is good, Grizabella is amazing (and that's saying something given I saw Elaine Page live perform that character and the iconic song Memories), Judy Dench is great in her role.

The songs and tunes are quite well known by now. The acting was hit-and-miss, depending upon who it was. The actress portraying ""Victoria"" did very well, even if some of the ""always protesting Alphabet crowd"" are aggrieved for being ""too white"" (actress is mixed race). ""Macavity"", ""Skimbelshanks"", ""Mistoffelees"", ""Munkustrap"" all did very well too.
To the actor portraying ""Bustopher Jones""-well don't give up your day job selling Keurig coffee makers. As for Rebel Wilson as ""Jennyanydots, Lord help us all; if you've seen her in any movie, she's ALWAYS the same character in all-UGH!
Judi ""M"" Dench as ""Old Deuteronomy"" and Ian McKellen as ""Gandalf"", oops ""Gus the Theatre Cat""-strange trying to hear them trying to sing. Taylor Swift, either you love her or you hate her. Jennifer Hudson as ""Grizabella"" sounded like a cat being strangled.
As for the CGI makeup on the actors, ""The Island of Doctor Moreau"" has had some creatures escape from the H. G. Wells' story. The human-faced mouses and the dancing cockroaches were beyond the EWW-factor.

333,todd-ramirez,Stay away unless you had liked Cats in the past,3,25 November 2020,"This latest screen adaptation of the Andrew Lloyd Webber musical was widely panned by both critics and viewers (currently 2.8/10 on IMDb). I read some of the reviews and here are my thoughts:1. If you're not a fan of musicals, you'll hate it.
2. If you're looking for a plot, there isn't one and you'll hate it.
3. If you've been a fan of Cats in the past - whether from watching it on stage or the music itself - you'll probably like this. Otherwise, you won't.
4. If you expect that humans can perfectly act out cats' mannerisms to anyone's satisfaction, you'll be sorely disappointed.
5. If you're looking for melodious tracks, you'll hate this. There is only one memorable tune in the original: Memory. I personally didn't like Jennifer Hudson's version here. I preferred Francesca Hayward's part in the two reprises. All other songs in the original pretty much have very little melody and are therefore forgettable. But they wrote a few new songs in this remake and one, 'Beautiful Ghosts,' is enough reason for you to watch this. Both Hayward and Taylor Swift sing it and both versions are good. If you don't plan to watch the film, at least listen to that song. I liked it enough to add to my music library.CASTING, ACTING
They cast a powerhouse of performers - Ian McKellen, Jennifer Hudson, Taylor Swift, Jason Derulo, Judi Dench, Idris Elba, James Corden, Rebel Wilson. Everyone did a good job acting out their roles. The singing is top notch.CGI, EFFECTS
I disagree with critics who panned the visual effects. I thought the visuals made for high production values. What they did right: they kept the actors' eyes so human emotion matched the feelings they were exuding from the lyrics. Compare this with the new Lion King where the animation barely conveyed any emotion from the scenes.Did I like the movie? No. I could only give it 3/10 because I'm not a fan to begin with. Even though I like Webber's The Phantom of the Opera and Jesus Christ Superstar (his best I think), I'm just not a fan of Cats.To summarize, watch this only if you liked Cats in the past.

342,ericjcant-1,"I was surprised at how whimsically fun and visually interesting Cats was. But yes, it is outside the bounds of traditional movie story ideals.",8,25 May 2020,"Is CATS a good movie? Hmm... no. But if the question instead asked if CATS is a good piece of entertainment, my answer would be ""yes."" Cats isn't a movie that works as a standard three act play. There is no arguing around this. Standard movie structure does not work here. Cats is more of a spectacle, in the sense of being a performance that is a mixed cocktail of expression and visuals that are quite impressive and surprisingly organic in flow, but not following a proper plot exactly. Cats does have a loose story attached to it, but it isn't really a story proper. It's sort of like what someone might come up with if they took a nursery rhyme about cats and visually interpreted it into a movie. So having a plot that works is not really the point of the show. Contextually it works together well enough, but its story structure is whimsical, or perhaps figurative(?). If you go to see this movie with the expectation that all must fit into a the three act template, this will not work for you, which seems to be why Cats is being hailed as an unholy terror by thousands of internet experts idiotically falling over each other to come up with new way to proclaim this movie's failure.... But I actually think Cats is quite good, for the type of theater creation that it clearly is, so you should go into this with that type of presentation in mine, which is not many movie goers kind of thing. Even Disney musical fans might find Cats to be too light on plot, even though the visual creativity and choreography is often stellar.Most of the scenes are whimsical and light, which makes the big dramatic scene feel a little top heavy. Most of of the show is cute and pretty, but ""light"" entertainment. Still, it does this specific job well. I would think kids under the age of four would really love this.One thing I am actually annoyed with as far as the haters go, is how everyone keeps blathering about how terrible the CGI is, and this really irks me, because there is SO much bad CGI out there, and this is so far from being bad CGI that it just seems like people are dumb when they try to point this out. I'm not saying it doesn't look mesmerizingly strange to see people as cats, but if it wasn't for all the boo-hoo I had read about what a CGI abomination this supposedly is, I honestly would have thought all the actors was dressed in exceptionally good costumes. That is the truth. The roles in Cats are far from complex, but everyone plays them well. In fact, even though the bulk of her character is only displayed through facial expression and movement, I adored every minute of Jessica Hayward's performance. She was exactly what the role should be, and basically so was everyone else. I thought Taylor Swift seemed more than just a little bit superfluous, but she didn't undermine the movie in any way.To end off here, I can't help but wonder if somebody important did not want Cats to happen, as a movie specifically. Either that, or maybe somebody just really has it out for Tom Hooper, because while I can understand Cats getting bad reviews for not have the consistency established as a ""good movie story"", it is also so far from being the monstrosity declared by every Tom, Dick and Harry. The cries of debauchery have been so outlandish that it has set off my spider-sense conspiracy warning... Cats just isn't what it is being panned as by critics. ""Bad movie""? Ok, fine. It is too fluid and abstract for many. ""Worst movie ever made""? Nope, not even close. Not even anything in this or any other parallel universes of bad movies. My suggestion: go see it with your 11 year old daughter, and this will help clarify the particularly rare and peculiar fun that Cats really is.(BTW, If you want to know what the worst movie ever made is, it was a musical called The Apple, and it came out in 1980. Just be warned.)",Cats

The Phantom of the Opera House is a good adaptation for example. Well, Cats ... I don't know. Luckily, the basic story wasn't very poked. Although there are a couple of new songs that aren't the best, but the other songs sound good nonetheless. They were good at re-arranging. The actors sing well with three singers and actors (James Corden, and Jennifer Hudson, Taylor Swift) stand out, but the other actors also sing well. The script complements the original work well. For example, the theatrical cat, one of the roles of McDouglas, the pirate cat also comes to life. The choreography also hit well. Macavity's motivation is understandable and well-crafted.

So much for the positives. CGI is something terrible. Putting faces on a fur coat makes it not a real cat yet. He's more of a nightmare monster than Freddy Krueger's right hand man. Especially Macavity looks pretty chilling. The sliding Skimblesanks figure in the casting was damn not hit.
Overall not a disappointment, but not so good, really few. I'd rather watch the musical online or in the theater.",Cats

356,Julie-C-Sherwood,A MUSICAL about CATS. What did you expect?,10,25 December 2019,"I understand the criticism, if I put myself in the position of someone who doesn't understand musicals or spectacle. I enjoyed this, and my 9 year old daughter was glued to the screen. The pacing is a bit off. The first 20 min is abruptly one song after another, but it has a beautiful story, even if the film is not story-centered. Steven McRae's Skimbleshanks number was so much fun to watch, I'm still singing the song. In true Tom Hooper style, it's beautifully shot and designed. But if you don't like musicals, this isn't for you. It's the most music-y of musicals. It's eccentric art. If it's not your style, that doesn't make it ""bad.""",Cats

I enjoyed the simple beauty of this legendary musical remake. The CGI worked for me. My 5 yr old daughter and I cried at Jennifer Hudson's rendition of Memory (although perhaps Elaine Paige will always be the one to sing it best). As Victoria, debut actress Francesca Hayward, who took a sabbatical from London's Royal Ballet to film ""Cats."", was a beautiful sight and danced well, but her singing talent was not quite as beautiful (but still enjoyable). Laurie Davidson, dazzles as the magical Mr. Mistoffelees, who doubts his abilities as a magician before realizing his self worth through the belief in him from his fellow Jellicles. Judi Dench covered her role well, bless her soul! An enjoyable fim all in all, but not quite a 10/10.",Cats

Kind of a reversal of hyping something as amazing only for it to be just ok.The first few songs are quite unorganized and Rebel Wilson's song is disturbing, at least to me.
After Judy dench shows up it gets decently entertaining. The dance number after that is good and the absolute showstopper, was Skimbleshanks The Railway Cat. Jennifer Hudson was Jennifer Hudson. She was good. If the first half was as organized and taken care of as the second half was, it would be much better. McKellen was very good as well.Look, CATS is a hard show to even sell to a stage audience. It's an acquired taste. It's not for everyone. Some parts (cough) Skimbleshanks, were very well done while other parts (sneeze) Rebel Wilson's song were atrocious.",Cats
360,davidgibson-19224,Don't be scared,3,12 October 2020,"Okay, let's be clear. This movie was awful and I am a fan of musicals. It was not as awful as I expected though and I suspect a lot of people who hated it never saw the play Cats. Let's be clear. The play was vastly superior, but both were about people in cat costumes singing songs. The songs were fine. Nothing wrong with the songs (except Rebel Wilson). Admittedly, I played video games on my phone while watching this. This may be overly generous, but I think the director was trying to do something artsy and just flat failed. I suspect I would have given it one more store if I had fast forwarded through Rebel Wilson's scenes. Some things can't be unseen.",Cats
361,admcdonough,People Are overestimating How Bad This Is,6,28 December 2019,"I came expecting to see the worst film of the year based on the buzz out there as did most of the other people in the theater. It starts off slow, but it actually picks up after the first ten minutes or so. I knew that a musical of this nature (a sung through musical) wouldn't be every one's cup of tea. And I knew that the deviations from the stage musical would cause some fans of the stage musical to pan it. And in truth the changes to the choreography were by and large very negative. But while not as good as the original choreography by a long shot, some of this choreography has its moments. I found that as long as I just evaluated it on its own and not in comparison to the original, I could find it enjoyable. Admittedly, I last saw Cats on Broadway over 30 years ago, so it was easier for me to forget how great the original was than some people. I hope I saw the version without the special effects fixed since there were some glaring problems in the version I saw. If this was the fixed version, then oh my god! The individual performances were good. I loved Taylor Swift's turn and Jason Derulo was terrific even if whoever did the special effects neutered him. Francesca Hayward was a standout throughout and Steven McRae's tap dancing was marvelous (he of course is one of the finest ballet dancers in the world, but I didn't know that he could tap dance like that too!). If only the choreography had let some of the other fine dancers shine like he was able to do since the cast was loaded with top notch dancers who would have really shined with something approaching the original choreography. Naoimh Morgan was a great Rumpleteazer and Danny Collins an excellent Mungojerrie. So this really could have been great with better special effects (meaning at least not with glaring errors) and with better choreography. But I enjoyed myself after the slow start and if people who don't mind a sung through musical can forget comparisons with the stage version and just take this on its own, I believe they can find enjoyment here.",Cats

But to be fair it was never suppose to be and putting aside everyone's dislike for the character designs (and not the visual effects, they're fine.), some things just aren't made to cross over all mediums. Apparently a semi plot was created to have a driving focus, which comes in the form of the entirely watchable Francesca Hayward's character. But in movie terms, it's 90% act I, 10% act III. It has maybe two decent musical numbers and whole lot of bland ones (and you know a movie's going wrong when Taylor Swift's solo is one of the good ones). The actors stay relatively committed to the farce and the cinematography and choreography is genuinely good, but I think it comes down to the director, at large. For the most part, it appears Tom Hooper is he's trying. Certain moments have a sheen to them, a certain level of craft. But other's look like they were made by an entirely different person. And even if he did put his heart and soul into this, to try and make it as good as humanly possible (and not for a truck load of money, which would be my guess), this again, sadly is not a movie, was never written as a movie and therefore has no place being called a movie.",Cats

Go see Richard Jewel.If you are like me you watched Cats on Broadway, watched the movie when it was still on VHS, and watched it at your local players theater after that. I worshiped this movie for years! So, like you I HAD to see this movie as a right of passage. Here is what I thought.The writers decided no millennial could figured out the concept of Heavyside Layer, which proved to be true. I mean how many reviews screamed ""What's a Jellicle Cat!?"" What idiots. For any one reading this, a JC is imaginary ok? Like elves and storm troopers. So, the writers decided they have to explain why cats are trying to be chosen because clearly no young viewer has the imagination to simply say ""Who cares? Enjoy the songs"".I digress, the movie drags until the ""Old Deuteronomy"" song. Then it is similar to your memories. Pun intended. Gus the theater cat was weak, Gandalf isn't a good singer and a great song lacked. In fact all of your songs are sung in a different tempo so, you won't be singing along. However, they added a NEW SONG I think called Beautiful Ghost. When Hayward sings it, you are stunned. Her voice is like an angel. Your mouth will hang open, go for that song. Taylor Swift does one song, Macavity, and she rocks it. The bright side of the movie. Oh and Taylor is hot even in a CGI cat suit!Finally, Memories. The song you came to hear. Jennifer Hudson's voice was simply too strong for this song. Memories is a delicate, end of your ropes, gutter song. Sung as your last chance. Jennifer belted it out like she was at a Super Bowl concert and it just didn't fit. My wife and I walked out saying this. With all this going against it, we liked it.

In theater this will work because you'll have the gorgeous ballet which will stun you, so you wont miss that there is actually no story.

Going into CATS I was expecting the absolute worst film just due to the amount of hate and criticism it got. But I have to say I feel as if the only reason they trashed CATS was really because this film is really not meant for kids. The film is overly sexual for kids, even though this was supposed to be for families the actual Broadway show wasn't. CATS was always meant for young adults. The music and acting is actually fine, I wasn't bothered by anything, of anything I feel that they rushed this film. Too many introductions of characters, the CGI was trashed too much! Although they could've done better with the hands and noses, everything else was stunning. Again this was trashed because this was way too sexual and dark for kids. The entire cast is technically a cult of cats trying to get a better life for the other world. Now cult of cats and fighting for the afterlife is way too much for kids! Taylor Swift who plays Bombalurina sings ""Macavity"" alongside Idris Elba was the best part of the film for me, just because it wasn't depressing, it felt like a Broadway Show should be. Although the part with her number singing about Macavity is very sexy and rather disturbing because she sprinkles a bunch of Catnip all over the entire clan of Jellicle's, and they all getting drugged up against their will.

The story follows a lonely, impressionable cat named Victoria as she, over the course of the movie, get inducted into a furry sex cult where the members compete in ritualistic dances to become a sacrifice to the cat god we see in the sky, of which bookends the movie.
Everything tolerable about this movie comes from the play, so clearly pasted onto this without any consideration as to if the lyrics are actually accurate to the movie they're in. At one point a cat gets it's hand caught in a torso-sized mouse trap, and in that same scene we see both Mice and Cockroaches, seemingly both the size of an ant. The images are uncomfortably sexual, the most noteworthy being a sequence where Jason Derulo and his followers drink copious amounts of milk. The milk in this scene is rendered so poorly it begins to bring another substance to mind.

But it doesn't make up for the fact that the storyline is pointless, the conflict was basically non-existent, and the humour is just so unfunny thanks to James Corden (though that is probably me being bias because I just can't stand the man) and Rebel Wilson, who has not played a different character since being introduced to the big screen, and her trope of ""Oh I fall over a lot and it's funny because I'm fat"" is so overdone it just makes me angry.

405,stellaarwennicolina,Amazing movie! What's all that hate?,9,9 January 2020,"I saw all the hate in the internet and now decided to also write a review. I went to watch cats because my friend persuaded me. I left the cinema with mixed feelings and a new celebrity crush.
No, but honestly, sure cats isn't the best movie that was ever shot, nor does it have the best acting performances in the world, but still it is made with incredibly much heart and appreciation of the old musical. The actors are so passionate about their roles that it's impossible not to adapt this feeling. My suggestion for seeing the movie is, to go in without expectations, so you'll just be surprised of what comes. Of course it's weird at some parts, but take it humourously. It was supposed to be that way.
The dancing is great! All the choreographies are just awesome! Maybe with the exception of Jennyanydots... She kinda sent even me to chills, but hey, just have a good laugh about it.
But in turns, Laurie Davidson as Misto is just so awesome!!!!!!!
And Taylor Swift and Jason Derulo do a better job than I had expected them to.
Judi Dench IS awesome too, so is Ian McKellen!
So, I give it a 9/10.",Cats
406,Le5zek,"Who wants to sink ""Cats""?",8,5 January 2020,"Or the first time I met where such a massive action aimed at discrediting the film work. I get the impression that most of the crushing reviews are written by people who have not even seen the trailer but want to join other critics.
I consider myself as an musicals, I know Webber's works very good, ""Cats"" by heart. I have seen musical on DVD and on stage. So I know what I'm writing about. Seeing the trailer did not frighten me - on the contrary, it raised excitement. Tom Hopper's visual experiment (furry actors) convinced me.
After the American premiere before Christmas Eve, depressing the film to the lower fifty on IMDB I could not believe it. I went to the cinema as soon as possible.
I am convinced that the film has been subjected to a planned trolling attack to ridicule it. I have read many critical reviev - I will try to answer for some of them.
1. ""Bad CGI"". The effects are exactly as they should be. They are not primitive, they do not interfere with the plot. If anyone wants to watch dancing trees and exploding space stations, let them go to the Avengers.
2. ""No plot"". This could be an objection rather to Webber than to Hopper. The musical itself is rather a collection of loosely connected songs and dance arrangements (because it's just a set of Elliot's poems). Hopper does a lot to baste this string in a syntactic scenario, adding dialogues here and there, changing the order of the songs. He frames the plan smoothly, jumping from the street to the bar, to the station, barge, to the apartment, the railway bridge over the River Thames.
2. ""Judi Dench with a mustache is wagging her tail"". How should the old cat look according to you? Female cats, unlike humans, also have a mustaches. Body-independent movements of the cat's tail are also a part of cats behavior.
The conventionality of the cat-people's characters did not blatantly somehow anyone in the theater but suddenly began to irritate everyone in movie.
I don't think Hopper's ""Cats"" is an outstanding film, but a very good adaptation. He likes to go against the tide. He proved this in Les Misérables, where he generated a naturalistic world much closer to the original Hugo's work than to the Claude-Michel Schönberg's musical. London in his vision of ""Cats"" is a bit surreal, shown from a cat's perspective, one will not see there humans.
What's good in the movie:
camera movement adapting dynamics to the cat's eyecolor tonelots of hidden gems (I advise you to have a good look at the place names, content of ads on Picadilly Circus in the background)modern choreography, it is no longer the work of the Gillian Lynne) but sparkling (except for Franceska Hayward's classical dance) hip-hop and breakdancing arrangementsexcellent acting, especially Ian McKellen's autopathy, but also a concert by Lady Judi Dench. James Corden and Rebel Wilson perfectly embedded in their episodes.The film is not perfect - contrary to expectations Jennifer Hudson didn't convince me (I expected much more from her ""Memory""), Hayward plays mainly with beauty and dance but not with skills. However, this is a very good adaptation of the musical and I look forward to Blu-Ray (which I am afraid will be on the market soon).
In conclusion, I will answer one more objection I encountered - ""what is the target group of this film"". Simple - fans of musicals, fans of good music. Unfortunately a group to small compared to young recipients, who are moved by a tree repeating one English-Dutch phrase over and over and over again talking with a raccoon. Therefore, the film will have an undeserved flop. Who is involved? I do not know.",Cats
407,Aasemoon,Underrated!,7,15 May 2021,"I have to admit, I do not understand how everyone hates this movie. I'm not quite saying that this is a gem, but despite some issues, it's actually quite an alright movie!First, there's a point, some kind of message simplistic as it might be, which is more than I can say for most movies of the current decade. Second, the cast can actually sing, and dance. Which has most certainly not been the case with some of the most popular musicals of the recent era (La La Land comes to mind).And while I'm sure the cat costumes were not for everyone, I don't believe the ratings here in any way reflect the quality of the movie.",Cats
408,jackass-26634,Even Worse Than The Emoji Movie,1,7 February 2020,"The Emoji Movie, was... a terrible movie. But Cats takes the cake for the worst movie of all time. Like, if we compare them both together, The Emoji Movie is a million times better. The Emoji Movie, while obviously a big waste of time, at least had some funny moments and decent voice acting, for the most part. It also didn't make my eyes bleed from the CGI. Cats, on the other hand has no redeeming qualities. Trash music and story, as well as disturbing and nightmare fuel ""cat people"".",Cats
409,TorontoFilmFan,I watched it to the end.,3,18 April 2021,"While watching the film version, I couldn't help but wonder why this play went on to become such a theatrical phenomenon worldwide. I have to admit that during the live production I saw in Toronto many years ago I fell asleep. It has an off-beat story, it has actors pretending to be cats, and only one famous song emerged from it. Nonetheless, the musical's success led to the inevitable 2019 film version.The film on the other hand did not enjoy any of the raves heaped on the theatrical version. And this time audiences stayed away in droves. So what is so horrible about the movie and why is it so notoriously bad?Let me start by mentioning that, for me, the movie has some wonderful musical segments with terrific choreography, visual effects and energy. The production design is top notch. The director generally knows where to put the camera and the editing is excellent rather than simply frenetic. The actors for the most part all seem committed and game and give it their all. The dancing is crisp and wonderfully executed, and there are a lot of sight gags and humorous moments. And count me in as one of those who watched this film to the end. So far so good, right?Sadly, pretty much all of the singing is dreadful. Rebel Wilson is particularly screechy even though she has one of the best production numbers. Francesca Hayward plays the young female lead and while she is pretty and an excellent dancer, her singing during her big number is painfully tinny. I didn't mind the switching from talking to singing, and credit to the actors/singers who enunciated clearly. Rare for a musical, the performers were intelligible and I was able to enjoy the lyrics. But the vocal quality so often was just plain bad. Jennifer Hudson is completely awful in the movie and her scenes are excruciating to watch. Her characterization of Grizabella is melodramatic and bizarre, and her singing is amateur and wretched if not totally flat. She absolutely tortures the play's most famous song ""Memories"", and made me think that no-one will be buying this film's soundtrack. Taylor Swift indeed was in this production but lucky for her she had a very small role and very short screen time towards the end of the film. Just enough of course, to add to the pile of mistakes the movie had become by that point. For some very strange reason she did her cat with a British accent which was jarring, and her dancing and smirking for the camera did not portend any notion of a future acting career.I didn't have a huge problem with the costumes and makeup. After watching many years of Star Trek, I think we've all become accustomed to seeing actors in humanoid costumes. But there was still plenty that was off-putting. The characters were supposed to be cats, not humanoid cats, yet they were acting more human than cats. Even when they were supposed to be rubbing up against each other as cats do the actors suddenly got tentative as if not to breach another's personal space. And the way they moved around in groups and in shots of them jumping on things, I often thought they looked and moved more like monkeys than cats! But that being the said, watching Ian McKellen lapping at a giant pool of liquid was just plain wrong. Many of the actors wore clothes over their cat costumes yet sometimes we saw them without clothes which I think was a big mistake. That juxtaposition was especially awkward towards the end of the film when Idris Elba as Macavity did his big musical number 'naked' . The creepy visual could not be ignored and will be hard to erase from memory.Some scenes went on way too long and the storyline weak. Most damaging, the dramatic portion of the film was centered on Grizabella which only drew further attention to Jennifer Hudson's awkward and amateurish performance. By the time she sails away to Heaviside or whatever it's supposed to be, this viewer was glad to see the credits roll.Turning this play into a feature film was not going to be easy. But we did see a level of creativity and artistic energy up on the screen as well as some really good performers. Judi Dench brought some grounded acting chops to this production in spite of her woeful singing abilities. Likewise performers Robbie Fairchild as Munkustrap and the excellent Laurie Davidson as Mr. Mistoffelees should not be criticised. So for effort and some good moments amidst all its missteps, I am generously rating Cats as a 3/10.",Cats

430,JGAS,A terrific translation from the stage to the screen,9,27 June 2020,"People who are saying ridiculous things like ""this is the worst movie I have ever seen"" says much more about them than it does about this movie.I've seen the play twice, a while ago, and the movie's ability to portray the music so well, to extend the quality of the scenes, and to knit a story together using Victoria was terrifically creative work. Watching the dancing, even seeing what the CGI folks did with ears, tails, and fur, and how well everything was put together was phenomenal. I never took my eyes off the screen. Thee was so much to see, watching how every scene was staged, how the movements were blocked, and the performance of individual actors were all excellent.Right, Judi Dench is not a great singer, but neither is the Old Deuteronomy character. Ian McKellan was wonderful in his spot, Jennifer Hudson better than anticipated, Rebel Wilson and James Corden really good choices letting their personalities come through, Steve McRae fascinating through his number, and Idris Elba a more involved Macavity than in the play. This doesn't even mention Francesca Hayward and the many excellent dancers who had background roles.But the thought and work that Tom Hooper, the choreographer, and the set director, achieved for this movie were exceptional.If someone is too young or too stupid to understand the story or to suspend belief to go into the world of cats, or gets spooked by seeing CGI fur and people moving like great dancers trying to emulate cats, or just wants to pretend to be ""cool"" and rip the production that's on them and a matter of a lack of understanding.

It is these great films that have a profound impact on audiences and the progress of cinema as a craft. 'Cats' is not a great film. 'Cats' is possibly the worst film I have ever had the displeasure of seeing in a movie theatre.There is no story, no conflict, no characterisation, no character arcs. The tone is wildly inconsistent, averaging out to an inescapable feeling of intense discomfort. The acting ranges from bland to embarrassing, made all the more disappointing given the level of talent among the cast. The visuals are best described as nightmarish. The sound mix is audibly grating. It is almost unbelievable to see a movie fail so spectacularly in all areas and at all levels.'Cats' doesn't even have the decency to fall into the category of 'so bad it's good'.

450,JamieClaye,Start 50 minutes in and you'll be fine.,5,13 June 2020,"Went in with VERY low expectations and was pleasantly surprised BUT - (and this is a big butt) the film really needs to start about 50 minutes in, just after the Jellicle ball.That said, if you don't know the play - starting there may be confusing because there is a tiny bit of story arc established in the first half.Let me fix that for you. There are a number of cats vying for the opportunity to be born again. Judi Dench gets to pick the only cat to get that prize on the night of the Jellicle Moon. That's all you need to know to be able to start at 50 minutes.The CGI cat appendages (Ears and tails) are pretty amazing. The costumes not too unlike the play - form fitting (not necessarily a good thing) and the sets...well they're pretty.The dance numbers in the first half are horribly choreographed, shot and edited. It's almost like someone else took over for the second half as they were more entertaining but note the second half is where all the signature songs reside, so that helps a lot.

This and the silhouettes of the 'naked' cats is just jarring. The cats that work are those that are draped in coats or clothing.Is it the greatest musical / film? No. But it's not that bad. It's ok.

I watched it yesterday online with very low expectations and I was surprised to find it entertaining, witty and quite emotional.
The characters look creepy, indeed but so so the ones from the sage version. OK, there's very little logic in the plot, but people seem to forget this show is about CATS.
The musical and dance numbers are beautiful. I absolutely loved Victoria, the Magical Cat, and the Theatre Cat (Sir Ian). Dame Judy Dench was adequate in her role too.
It is heartbreaking to see how people enjoy hitting somebody who is already down. Maybe the movie doesn't deserve 10 stars, but it most DEFINITELY does not deserve 2.7 stars.

I have seen my fair share of 3s and 4s and even a few 1s. This production of ""Cats' is nowhere near that category. It never ceases to amaze how armchair critics, and even paid critics, can so casually look at a production that obviously to a lot of work to make and trash it as ""garbage"", ""a disaster"", ""a waste of time"" or any of the other many negative adjectives they use to describe something they themselves have neither the wherewithal, money, or connections, to ever make themselves. I often wonder what they would make if they had the talent to make anything other than negative, non constructive criticisms, of other people's labor and efforts.Are there bad, awful, movies out there? Yes, Loads of them. But when you see 900+ movies in a single year you come to realize that it is not most of them. A lot a movies are average which does not make them bad. I have seen B movies, (I even call some of them B+ movies) that are as good as and even better than some 'A' movies rated highly here on IMDb.But getting back to the negative 'Cats' reviews.
It seems to me that what we are seeing here with all these 1s and 2s and ""I wish I could give it a 0"", ""now I want to die"", and ""what a waste of time"" ( although what else they had better to do...they never say), are as I described earlier ""armchair critics"" who are merely following the leader. An earlier review by some nameless, but paid critic, said the ""CGI made the movie creepy."" And sure enough you see that same description parroted here several times by people who can compare it to nothing other than the 'Broadway' version for how awful is. Followers following a leader without an original observation.I'm glad I know better than to base every movie I see on the ratings given by people who expect every movie they see to change their lives. Now granted, Most of the 2s and 3s given here on IMDb are well deserved and I avoid them. A LOT of the 4s are 5s ( in my opinion) are really 5s and 6s and are really good, enjoyable, movies, if you are not only looking for Marvel Blockbusters or big budgets with big named stars. Every movie cannot be a Marvel Studios blockbuster or a Jason Bourne hit and star Anthony Hopkins or Robert De Nero.This is all my opinion I know. And a lot of you will give 'me' a 1 or 2 for this essay. But there are some of you who will agree with me and like one person said, ""open a beer and enjoy the movie."" Those of you haven't seen 'Cats', give it a break and imagine how You would make it better if you could when you do see it. And keep in mind when the 'Wizard Of Oz' first came out some of the critics trashed that too. I'll bet anyone dollars to donuts in 25-30 years most people will not see 'Cats', as ""cat litter"".",Cats

Hopper (as with the ever do lacklustre Les Miserables) shows that he is a workmanlike director with no particular vision. His default seems to be point the camera and crew and hope for the best.

But this cinematic interpretation hit the exact right note for me.If you're going in expected a heavy plot, you'll be disappointed. The tale is simple... about as simple as it gets... a group of felines singing of their personalities and lives.Of course, there is a meta allegory... about how people (particularly theatre performers) are of a specific ilk... which tends to range from playful to naughty to capricious to otherworldly... just like that of felines.So, if you appreciate poetry and ballet... and you have a particular fondness for kitties (from the house tabby to a lion)... you might just love Tom Hooper's version of CATS... which, for me, elevated the stage material to something that can only be done in movies... as well as in ones own heart.",Cats

The dancing is superb,I liked the special effects and staging, the singing is ok most of the time, and the rendition of ""Memory"" is excellent. You have to realise that actors can rarely sing and dance and visa versa. Cats is a fantasy set to music and if you loved the stage version, then this is very little different.

1. This is a filming of the classic musical. So yeah, the story is pretty set. The characters and story itself is what it is, and there are some parts that maybe should have gone another way for a stronger film. But again, this is a filming of the musical. It's not a ""based on..."" or newly written film. Theatrical musicals are limited in different ways than movies are.
2. Yes, it's about people dressed up as cats and acting out a cat's life. (Just like the story always has been.) This means you have to accept this general fact. Is it stupid, maybe, but it's the same story that's been running on Broadway and in London for years and years. If you aren't willing to accept that ""Cats"" is about cats, well - surprise, you won't like this film.If you can accept these two rather simple facts, you will end up seeing a very special movie, just because of them. Its music, its dance, its family focused drama. I went with my 14 year old and we both enjoyed it! Have I seen better movies? Of course, but I have seen plenty, plenty worse.And I also have to say, just because this movie is one of a kind, makes it special. Never before has Andrew Lloyd Webbers creations become so alive, with CGI-animated ""cats"" (remember rule no 2). There are so many mainstream films, regardless of genre.

Now the movie, oh boy, the music the dancing is truly there, but it feels empty, the look of the cats is a nightmare or maybe some furry dream who knows, and most of all it has movie edits to make it more purrfect, see what I did there.

It's similar to cancelling James charles- nobody knows the context but they just join in. And I think critics are too.I loved this movie - give it a go. Read about ""cats"" before you see it. It's not a new story- it's a re-make.",Cats
497,alangmcw-850-641963,Perfect for cat-ladies,6,30 December 2019,"Well I'm going to give this a moderately positive score, because I enjoyed it for what it is - a movie version of a stage musical which is based loosely on T.S. Eliot's charming stories. I was accompanied by a neighbour who loves her own cats, and we had both seen the stage musical many years ago. The production uses CGI to enhance the costumes and movements of the human cast, and I think this works well. The performers are clearly still human beings dressed in cat costumes, which seems to be a look that some reviewers can't accept. I presume that some of the negative reviewers might prefer cartoon animation, but I reckon that what this movie does works well.
It isn't Tom & Jerry, or James Bond, or Star Trek, or romantic comedy, or of any other conventional genre. This is a different kind of movie, and I suggest for a different kind of audience: ideally cat-ladies who have seen the stage musical at least once.",Cats
498,rivkasieff,Wonderful Soundtrack Saves Cats,8,23 December 2019,"I've been in love with the music of cats since I was 12. In my 30s I saw the stage show. It wasnt great but not terrible. Yes it does lack plot, its basically a song and dance extravaganza with people in very tight leotards and cat ears and whiskers. Memory is the highlight. One of my favourite songs ever.
So,I wanted to see the movie, but I knew what to expect, I wasnt shocked by the cat costumes or searching for a plot, infact the movie tried to improve the plot somewhat. So I wasnt fond of This version of Macavity. He is not meant to be a pantomime villain but a sleek, cool, mysterious cat.
I did like the characterisation of Victoria, Mr Mistoffoles and Grizabella. Jennifer Hudsons Memory was good enough, Taylor swifts Macavity was let down by her weaker voice. Overall I did like it and so did my friend, it was a packed Saturday night screening and no mass walk outs.
I understand people not liking it but I dont understand this mauling its getting. Did they know nothing of the stage play before they bought their ticket and what exactly were they expecting?",Cats

510,EveAngel-666,"Not great, not bad. Ignore reviewers dogpiling their hate onto this",6,4 January 2020,"Never seeing the stage show of Cats I figured seeing this could give me a chance to see why it became such a phenomenon as a stage show. I also love seeing movies that are hyped and then get low views. So after seeing the movie even in spite of the negative reviews, I've concluded the negative reviews have a problem with the uncanny valley and can't get past it to enjoy the movie. They are now simply dog piling their negative reviews onto it because everyone else is.There is no immediate story, this is a chance to just hang out with cats as we follow nice to look at newcomer Francesca Hayward's cat version as she is tossed from a car into a new neighborhood full of Jellicle cats (and some mice) who she gets to meet.As a fan of The Rocky Horror Picture Show 10/10, Moulin Rouge (10/10 visuals/costumes 7/10 everything else), The Sound of Music (7.5/10), this is not bad - I'll give it a 6. As I was watching I couldn't help but think if they had simply gone with the spandex costumes from the theater instead of CGI, it would have been easier on the eyes and not make them look demonic. Rebel Wilson and James Gordon aren't bad, but I would have used real actors and tighten up the story/lessen the length of songs instead rather using than celebrities because if you hate those celebs, you hate spending time with their characters. They were there for the funny, but it was uneven to the rest of the film.45 mins into the movie a story still was not presented and I was getting agitated. It was just one cat being introduced after another with a song. Then even after a new cat is introduced, that cat disappears and never lends anything to the story. I understand, you want to submerge the audience into the world but after 45min, lay a story to follow! But no story came, just dance and song after dance and song. After 1 hour I wanted to go home. After 1 hour 15 min, I started squirming in my chair, after 1 hour 30 min, please make it stop.6 / 10",Cats

521,nielw,Seems like all the negative reviews are mostly from people not familiar with the stage musical,7,26 March 2020,"If you don't know what the stage musical is about, then this movie will just seem like utter nonsense. Because it kind of is. There's not a great story there, but man there is some good music. Until Phantom, Cats was the longest-running Broadway show. And don't forget that the show, in turn, was based on some old T.S. Eliot poetry about cats. It's just bizarre stuff all around.
I knew what I was getting when I watched this. It's exactly what I imagined. This is a movie adaptation of a stage musical. I don't disagree that it works much better as a stage musical, but this version is not without its merits. Some great performances by Taylor Swift, Jennifer Hudson, Judi Dench and Ian McKellen.
The music was as great as it's always been. Catchy songs by Lord Andrew Lloyd Webber. I'm still humming the familiar tunes a week later. However, the singing could've been better.
So what's terrible about this movie that makes everyone hate it so much? Like I said, strange material for a movie. Also, creepy CGI and a bland performance from the lead. Not much structure. It's more like a series of songs being tied together by the occasional dialog.
If you're looking for a more typical 3-act Hollywood formula, look elsewhere.
Overall, definitely worth a watch if you love musicals.",Cats

Was it a horrifying experience that will never leave my brain. No it was not. The movie was everything I expected the cats movie to be and more. Could it be better? 100% yes it could be better. But this movie is a perfect example if the negative hype reaches it before the positive does.

I saw an article this morning commenting about the actors' loss of dignity for appearing in this movie. The only people who should fear for their dignity are the critics and trolls who rushed to judgment long before the movie hit theaters and the ones who followed them like sheep. Huge nasty pile-on. I can understand how Cats isn't to some peoples' taste. I saw the original show on Broadway long ago and wasn't terribly impressed, mainly because the Andrew Lloyd-Webber music is pretty weak. Basing a musical on whimsical T.S. Eliot poetry is high concept from the get-go, but it benefitted greatly from conversion into film, while retaining its theatricality. The costumes and the actors inhabiting them were excellent, especially Francesca Hayward, who was absolutely luminous in the lead role. There were five in our party when we saw the film, including three who hadn't seen the theater version - we all thought it was excellent. I lost not one iota of respect for anyone associated with this film, but my respect for film critics in general has fallen to a new low.",Cats

Jennifer Hudson's weird beard effect.
Jennifer Hudson crying through the whole film, sing the damn song and stop with the gurning!
Ian McKellen lapping out of a bowl.
Judi Dench singing. Love her, hate that someone said ""sing it, Judi"".

The series of musical numbers attempting to explain it is difficult from the stage. With the movie the settings are flexible and I can say we have more clarity now. I was very impressed with the lead cat Victoria. All the cats' movements draw your eyes like magnets, but Victoria is mesmerizing. Had to look up that she is an accomplished ballet dancer. Just like when I saw the musical 20 years ago, I still think Memory and the Mr. Mistoffelees songs are the strongest, but in the movie I'm able to appreciate the weaker numbers as well. If you hate this movie, I recommend avoiding the play as well. It's the same exact story. I'm of the opinion the movie is far more approachable for most people. And for me far more enjoyable.",Cats

Since I loved the stage plays, I saw it when it came out and was not impressed, barely finishing it, but watched it again recently. The dancing, music, sets, and costumes are magical. Several of the actors were engaging. Judi Dench and Jennifer Hudson were excellent. The actor playing Virginia and the ones playing Skimbleshanks and McCavity danced beautifully In spite of not having a proper cat, Taylor Swift was a lot of fun.

532,eileen-guthrie555,Hollywood should be shot for ruining one of the best musicals of all time. What were they thinking?,1,3 November 2020,"I rarely review television shows or movies, but I felt compelled to speak out against this abomination of my favorite musical of all time. I cannot tell you just how horrible this movie was, at least for me. I knew there would be elements from the Broadway musical, that simply cannot translate to the screen. The intimacy and the relationship between the Cats and the audience is sadly missing. I was a HUGE fan of the Broadway musical so much so that I went to see it 8 times. It's such a wonderful experience, I just kept taking new friends to see it. The only thing I can say is that it was magical for me and my friends.The stage version was very simplistic. The stage and the seating was setup as an old tire, from a junkyard, the audience was one half of the tire and the stage the other half. As the musical progresses, the cats go out into the audience, they are playful, affectionate, prowled and stalk the audience members, while the rest of the cats are performing on stage. They would rub their head on your leg sometimes they would roll over for a belly rub. Eight times it was never the same, they each did something different every time we went. The audience becomes part of the play and that is what draws you in.When I went to see it for the first time, one of the cats rubbed it's head against my leg, your so engrossed by what is happening on the stage, that when it rubbed my leg I jumped a foot in the air. That seems to be what happens to a lot of people. Two cats started fighting, another time it hissed at me. Another time it wanted me to rub its head. I had heard that they had to study cat movements for about 6 weeks before joining the company.Number one, the film musical is way over produced, the backdrops looks like a soundstage. The musical NEVER left the junkyard, they didn't go wandering around London. They had beat up old cars and the cats would climb through the windows and pop out of the trunk. The props in this movie are kind of tacky. The glamour cat, Grizabella, we got very lucky to see one of Betty Buckley's last performances, we all got goosepimples from her performance of that famous song. She will always be Grizabella to me. We saw it with Elaine Paige too. Grizabella is in the first number ""Jellico Cats"" in the Broadway version and she's not even there in the movie version. I like Jennifer Hudson, but I don't like her version of Memories, her voice is too big for that role of an older vulnerable cat, as she remembers how much she was once loved and then discarded.I found Taylor Swift, James Corden and Rebel Wilson a distraction. They hyped up Taylor Swift, who is in the movie less than 5 or 10 minutes. Another thing that bothers me is cats don't have brown eyes. None of the cats in the stage musical had brown eyes. I was NOT impressed by Taylor Swift dancing or singing ability; she has a pop voice NOT a Broadway musical voice. I actually find her a bit annoying. Same with Rebel Wilson. There personalities are just too big.Sometimes it's better to leave these things well enough alone. Hollywood should have NEVER made this movie, they removed what was so special and magical from the stage versions. Sometimes it's appropriate to just say no. I hear they'll be making Wicked into a movie and they will probably destroy that musical as well, what ""star"" will be singing and mangling the song Gravity (another showstopper). Please don't ruin that musical Hollywood. Hollywood once again, ruined something that was so special and magical. They should be ashamed of themselves. The audience it's part of the stage musical, in the movie your just an observer. What the hell were they thinking? I would give this movie a zero, but it won't let you do that, so I will give it 1 OUT of 10.",Cats

Aside from the animation worsening a bit on cats in the corners of the screen, the film is well executed, the singing is phenomenal, and people are just hating on this because they want to, and to me, that's really sad. This was someone's dream and audiences are stomping all over it. Hopefully it continues to make money from people who go see it with an open mind, but unfortunately, it it isn't Disney, it is being pounded into the ground for taking risks and being weird. Heck, even when Disney does do something weird, it's never truly weird, and I'm sick and tired of people blasting anything they find different just because it's different.

542,MissFKM,Stop taking things so seriously critics!,7,11 February 2020,"I watched this movie with my partner and we both quite enjoyed it. My partner had never seen the stage adaption but I have and I thought they did a really good job with what they had.I honestly don't get the negative reviews but if you dissect them closely you will see that the majority of negative reviewers have either
A. Never seen cats the stage adaption
B. Don't like the costumes
C. Claim there is no plot (which suggests they haven't seen the stage adaption) or D. Explain nothing of what they disliked again suggesting they either haven't seen the stage adaption or are just highly confused individuals that find it hard to comprehend that a musical movie about cats will include dancing and singing cats.Now I'll admit this movie could have been a lot better. I didn't care that much for one of the new added musical numbers and was slightly disappointed by Jason Derulos' performance as Rum Tum Tugger, who I felt missed a lot of that oomph and va va voom the original Tugger had. His vocals were fine but lacked sass and depth. I did enjoy his rendition but feel that the character of Rum Tum Tugger is so central in the original that I wanted to feel that connection to the character and I just didn't get his cheekiness and arrogance as I did with the stage show and nor did he play as much as a part in the movie as I'd have liked but still a good attempt from Jason whom I usually love.Jennifer Hudson is outstanding as always and sings all her parts with emotion and poise.Judy Dench did well as the gentle Deuteronomy and I loved Victoria as we see a lot more of her and learn of her background which brings the story alive in a way that you don't get to see on stage.James Corden was terrific but his number could have been edited slightly. Comic gold but just dragged ever so slightly.I personally preferred the choreographed routines from the stage adaption as I felt the lack of within the movie meant that sometimes, dance scenes looked a bit less polished and chaotic but I get they did the best with what they had.They left a song out that I feel should have stayed in and replaced the new unnecessary Thames song. That was lost on me.Idris Elba as Macavity was menacing and creepy but if i'm honest I don't feel they made him creepy enough. It started off well but then towards they end he looses that IT factor but that was due to the script.Mr Mistoffelees was very good and quite a central character and I enjoyed watching his relationship with Victoria however his main musical number lacked mystery and I didn't like that he sang his own song unlike in the stage adaption but that is just me.I loved the visuals and graphics, especially at the beginning. If you've seen this on stage, you'll know what I mean. I finally got what the whole cat in bag thing was all about thanks to the movie and it was nice having a tangible backstory which helped in understanding Victoria and her introduction the cats as well Grizabella etc.Overall this was an enjoyable movie for anyone who doesn't take life too seriously, likes a bit of humour and nostalgia and has seen cats the stage musical. If you haven't seen this on stage then you're unlikely to truly 'get it' though can still enjoy the watch if you have an open mind and are fond of unusual and beautiful art. That is all this movie is.

550,sistermarysnow,A film for people with creative backgrounds and perspectives,8,11 October 2020,"This film was excellent. If you understand theater, stories, and musicals, you're able to look beyond what other people see. The actors did a phenomenal job portraying their characters. I watched the film on HBO Max and had the subtitles to read the lyrics to help me understand the lessons taught. They helped me follow along and see past what others have said. The story is about cats who have a competition, along with other sub plots. At the end, Judy Dench's character picks the winner. Another story line was of a cat who needed to learn vet culture. There's a
lot of Symbolic themes in this film. I was drawn to Victoria's story line, among many others. To my understanding, she was captured and forced into a group of cats that already understood what it meant to be a cat. She learned various life lessons from various cats with different experiences. I like the bond she develops with Jennifer Hudson's character. Hudson's character needed a fellow cat to bring her back from...""isolation"" (or whatever her experience was). To me, the lesson of the movie was that we have to learn to accept people from all walks of life, and see past what others think of us. Also, it's never ok to cut corners to get what you want. If we put ourselves in others shoes, we are empathetic to their situation. Rebel Wilson adds a nice comedic touch to the film. As do other characters. I'm biased because I love her comedy. The songs were amazing and showed the story. The only thing I would change about this film is to add more dialogue. There were a lot of songs, which for the general audience would be hard to follow without subtitles and the effort of concentrating on what they were singing. I loved the dancing, the CGI, the costumes, and the setting. I'm really I glad I took the time to analyze this film for what it was. Andrew Loyd Webber's original songs made the film come alive. More dialogue, as opposed to singing, to push the story along would help the audience understand what's going on without the subtitles. Kudos to all the people who worked on this film.",Cats
551,dvdhaven-1,Disappointing,4,18 October 2020,"Many one-star reviewers seem not to haveany arguments in their reviews, so here is a more motivated one...
I have long been a fan of Andrew Lloyd Webber, ever since I saw Jesus Christ Superstar on stage in London. Evita and Cats were logical follow-ups in style and music.
This film has a lot of faults, but a few redeeming features as well. The faults:
1. The cats look creepy, all facial expressions seem to be weird and unnatural.
2. Nobody seems to be able to sing properly, not even Jennifer Hudson. In a musical/opera you'd expect people to be able to sing, as that's the the essence of the art form.
3. The choreography makes no sense at all and just adds to the creepiness of it all.
4. Inserted spoken dialogues trying tonadd more of a storyline to the musical are unnecessary.
The redeeming feature of the film is the decor, which looks astonishing, along with the lighting.
In sum, not as bad as a one-star, but not enough to entertain me.

1. These cats are dead. This isn't a spoiler. It's the ""plot"" of the movie. I don't know how more people haven't realized they're already dead and competing to be reborn. The second song is on gravestones for goodness sake.
2. They live in purgatory where their lives are controlled by Judi Dench for no real reason. She gets her powers from the moon and arbitrarily decides every cat's fate.
3. Idris Elba has completely undefinable powers, but he can basically do whatever he wants with you and when he's done, you'll be an outcast doomed to sulk in the shadows like poor Jennifer Hudson.
4. Underpinning all this is a hellscape where mice and cockroaches with human faces and bodies are kept as slaves and forced to perform for their cat masters who are free to eat you when you don't perform well or if if they're in the middle of a song. These cockroaches and mice scream for their lives as they're eaten.
5. There are no rules. This is chaos, and no one is safe.It's what I imagine a hallucinogenic trip would feel like. The inexplicable high top shoes blew my mind. The final song (which establishes that cats are not in fact dogs, just in case you were wondering I guess) is sung with them standing on a freaking lion statue.Because of (in spite of?) all this, seeing Cats in the theater was the best moviegoing experience of my life. I laughed so hard at one point I had to get up and walk to the back of the theater while I regained control. This movie is like The Room except with an insane budget.

I loved it so much that I learned EVERY song along with my little sister and we'd break break out singing as often as we could.After watching this pile I had to send my sister a text to summarise how I felt about this film (I'll censor out the stronger language).""What the H**l did they do to Cats?What idiot decided Fat B****rd should play in another film where she'd need to sing and dance, she can do neither! And they gave HER the fight with Macavity and of course she HAD to hit the other cat in the nuts!The gender switch was fine, we're talking about cats after all (not pleased with that choice but I can get over it) and Judi Dench did fine. As did Grizabella.They made Mungojerrie and Rumpleteazer work WITH Macavity which is also unforgivable but not as unforgivable and removing Jemima altogether and giving her solo to Victoria.About the only good thing I found about it was the little extra song that they gave Victoria which was a nice little song.What's worse though? The exposition. The fun part of Cats is that not a word was spoken. Now they're TALKING between songs.Of course ""fat B****rd just HAD to make Bustopher Jones's song about her, didn't she? I can certainly see why you hated Rum Tum Tugger's song.I have to watch the original film just to erase this garbage from my mind!I want Jemima back!Mungojerrie sang like he was out of breath and they didn't even remove the sounds whenthe dancers landed. these are supposed to be cats, they don't thump the ground!""And that, my dear reader, is how strongly I felt about this film.As you might have noticed, I think casting Rebel Wilson as Jennyanydots was a huge gaffe. She just HAD to sexualize the character. I don't recall Susie McKenna doing that. Wilson however can't do anything without telling people how sexually attractive she is. I can't say this enough, Wilson... if you have to constantly tell us that, then you're probably not attractive!These people have thrown one of my favourite films of all time into the gutter!

567,racheyroxrs,I don't know,5,12 November 2020,"I don't HATE it... My son loves it so we've been listening to it a lot. I love musicals but this CGI is disturbing. I keep trying to think of another way they could've done it to make it less upsetting but I cannot come up with anything that wouldn't ruin the point of the show. If they used ONLY CGI instead of actors, then we'd miss out on the dancing. If they did only costumes, we'd lose the fantasy and it would seem dated... I mean, I didn't pay attention to it until I heard Jennifer Hudson's performance and that's what hooked me in because every scene that she takes part in is truly moving. Her story is heartbreaking and you can hear it in her voice and see it in her eyes. But the CGI fur, ears and tails meshed with the human bodies and with the constant switching from being on all fours and being bipedal makes my brain feel like it's misfiring. The parts I love I really do LOVE but the rest is so damn confusing and distracting. I think they may have achieved what they were going for... The original musical was bizarre as well. I don't mind bizarre... But this feels like it took it a step further and when there was nowhere left to go and it walked right off a cliff.Bottom line: if you like musicals, or weird movies, I do recommend you watch it because it is an experience, albeit at times, a disturbing one, still has moments that are really moving.

570,space-57707,The Iceberg that Hit the Cat-tanic,8,31 December 2019,"In a short and simple review, Cats is not what all the nay-sayers are making it out to be. 8 stars for the recut version, a noticable improvement over the original that would have 7 stars. Cats is strange and different, but it fits the strange-and-different trend in recent movies. Cats has more than the usual amount of strange and different, but not as much as the harsher critics claim. Not bothering with the film's quality or details, I'll just leave well enough alone.Except for one minor detail hardly worth mentioning. One crucial flaw. The single worst thing about this movie as well as all other Hollywood fare. It's budget. To be more precise, the budgetary ways and means of Hollywood.Given it cost $100,000,000 to make Cats, it cost another hundred million to distribute and advertise. The average cinema ticket, however much it costs, has to have at least 50% going to the cinema that shows Cats, with no more than 25% going to Universal Pictures. Cats could make a profit if it grosses more than $400,000,000. It has grossed around a tenth of that, but this is only its 10th day of its first run. Cats might break even in 3-6 months, considering it can profit from home video release.Compare this business to the Rise of Skywalker: its budget of $275,000,000 requires a gross of $1.1 billion before profit shows up. Is it anywhere near that yet? Can Disney deny a loss of their own in the hundreds of millions?The Hollywood money system, if not broken, is built to break movies. In a previous decade, a movie's cost of distribution and marketing would amount to no more than 25% of its production cost. This was when movies came on reels of 35mm film. Digital technology is the current medium of the movies, so should it not cost less to distribute and exhibit? The cinemas need not take as much percentage of their tickets, and they would still make more than enough of their own profit to pay their workers well and maintain their venues well.In a more sensible world, no movie would have to gross four times it budget (if not five or six!) to begin to make money for its studio, since the profiteers who want their money up front would settle for sensibly smaller amounts. Why would Universal or Disney demand so much money to distribute digital video files to cinemas? Who would Universal and Disney have to pay so much money to for the digital services? Why would not a major studio consider a distribution and marketing cost as part of a movie's production budget? Or pay for such out of their own bank accounts, since the major studios are capable of doing so with ease?This miserly money-grubbing stinginess at multiple levels is what tilts the playing field against the good people who do honest work to make the movies as good as they are, and more good people's honest work to keep the movie venues as good as they are.",Cats
571,space-57707,Cats and Good Visual Effects,8,14 February 2020,"""As cast members of the motion picture Cats, nobody more than us understands the importance of ... "" spoke James Corden, then joined by Rebel Wilson to intone in unison ""GOOD VISUAL EFFECTS!"" In the Oscars show, right before they presented the award for Best Visual Effects. While made up in character as Bustopher Jones and Jennyanydots, and indeed seeming an example of two other Oscar categories, (Not-So-Good) Makeup and Costumes.An article in Esquire states that Cats' box-office failure is being blamed on its visual effects, and that the Visual Effects Society is not happy about it. One VFX artist tweeted ""I assume these two were really classy and thanked me for working 80 hour weeks right up until I was laid off and the studio closed, right?"" (Haven't we been there ourselves? We, the moviegoers who work for our living, and come to the theaters with any spare dollars we'd have if we're lucky?)Corden and Wilson did not make a serious statement, they were just being funny. Poking a little fun at someone else's expense, maybe. However, the wrong thing to do is to put the blame on the VFX artists. That wrong thing has been done by many critics and many moviegoers. Many, but not all.Seriously, Cats does have visual effects that are actually good. Every bit as good as those of 1917, Endgame, Skywalker, The Irishman and The Lion King. Cats' underperformance is not due to its VFX. The best visual effects in the world will not compensate for a story told badly. Just how badly told is Cats' story, in comparison to Endgame and Skywalker, is still in debate among moviegoers.Cats is not really as bad, or as weird, uncomfortable or ""traumatic"" as people call it. Cats' biggest issue is this: people don't like it. Not all people, just a lot of them. They don't like the VFX. They don't like the way the story is told, or the story itself, any way it could be told. The people have no reason to not like any of it, no reason except their own individual opinions.The VFX artists and companies, as well as the movie crews in all departments (makeup, costumes, production design and cinematography among them) all do as well as they can. They work hard and long for their pay and the sake of their art. They have control over the look and quality of their movies. But there is one factor that they have no control over: whether any viewer will like it or not. The best artists in the world cannot make an individual like it.The free world, our free will and freedom of choice, not even ""The Dream Factory"" has much control over it all. Cats has been called a scary-looking movie, but every viewer is able to decide for themselves to accept it or reject it. This ability of ours, one that we usually don't think about much. Try to imagine some kind of movie that could take away from you that very ability. Would such a thing be any less unbearable that a movie like Cats?",Cats

It's outstandingly boring. The music is forgettable, the lyrics usually repeat the same line 8 times, the dancing is uncreative and there is next to no emotion. I don't really have a problem with the way the cats look, but production design as a whole falls a bit flat, all locals are generic, and cinematography is generally about slow pans for minutes on end, which just boosts the boredom further.The gimmick, of everyone being a cat, becomes pointless already a few minutes in, and while the actors themselves look quite impressive most of the time, there are (quite many, honestly) bad looking CGIs (a CGI water scene in particular completely got me off guard with its badness).The movie fails in its visuals to get away with just being an artsy flick, the music completely fails to touch you (as opposed to other recent musicals like La La Land) and generally it just comes across as a seemingly endless barrage of bad, almost nonsensical music videos which play one after the other with just a few seconds of pause in between.The good?

I mean, they got the cat look right, from a technical standpoint... and Taylor Swift actually did not deliver a performance so hitty you will remember it for decades, like most female singers manage to do in their cinema debuts. Actors overall really look similar to the originals, surprisingly. But it really doesn't save much and effort can only get you so far if the idea itself is destined to be hated.I would like to believe there is a certain set of people who'd enjoy this, maybe people who saw the original musical and are somehow attached to the songs because they were presented to the viewers in a more enticing manner. But that's, if at all, a very tiny percentage of your general audience.It's not the worst movie I've ever seen, probably wouldn't even make the top 50, but it just might be the worst movie I've ever seen on the big screen.Add: I saw this film in Germany and all songs were dubbed in German. That's not cool, you don't get someone like e.g. Taylor Swift and then redub the whole thing...",Cats
589,samuel-bell94,An Insult to Fans,2,7 May 2021,"In 1939 T. S. Eliot wrote a collection of poetry called Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats. Nearly 50 years later in 1981 Andrew Lloyd Webber managed to tie this whimsical anthology together with a thin and questionable plot combined with some of the best music and costumes Broadway had ever seen. Now 38 years later, that musical is getting a film adaption that tries even harder to force a plot into existence and look as pretty as possible; at the expense of all else. A goal, that if they had succeeded, may have even been enough to save the film. Reality is rarely so kind, however.While no one can deny that director Tom Hooper was able to obtain some serious talent, pulling in Hollywood heavyweights like Judi Dench, Ian McKellen and Idris Elba, the script that Hooper and Lee Hall wrote for the film gives the actors so little to work with that even they end up looking like bad parodies of themselves. Combined with what was done to the iconic music of the play, shortened run times, absent pieces, invented inserts, and arbitrary cutaways, even the musical giants dragged into this mess, such as Jason Derulo, Taylor Swift, Jennifer Hudson, James Corden, and Rebel Wilson were made a mockery of. My own personal thoughts about Taylor swift aside, I can respect the song written for this production, (Beautiful ghosts) as an exceptional song, but its inclusion doesn't make up for what was removed.All these factors together with the (rightfully) controversial aesthetic of the film. Mean that while this film clearly had a budget that could make any non-Disney producer nervous. It doesn't end up with anything that actually looks good. It's striking certainly, but in the way a defaced print of the Mona Lisa is striking. It draws your attention and makes you look closer in order to work out exactly what the situation is, but it doesn't make you happy to see it and it certainly doesn't inspire a second viewing.To give credit where it is due thou, Cats does possess one saving grace that may yet secure its place in pop culture as something other than a burning train wreck. The dancing. As anyone who has seen In the Heights or Hamilton can tell you, Andy Blankenbuehler is one hell of a choreographer. With classically trained Ballet stars such as Francesca Hayward, Steven McRae, Robert Fairchild and Eric Underwood working alongside new-age dancers such as Les Twins and others. Blankenbuehler makes use of all their unique skills and puts them all on display one after the other. If nothing else, this film stands a wonderful showcase of dance styles and techniques.Alas, Cats is not a dance theatre performance, it is a live-action adaption. Here we reach the sliding scale of success vs relevancy. As a performance showcase, it is quite good. As a musical film, it is alright. As a theatrical film debuting alongside Star Wars, it is bland and forgettable at best. As an adaption of Andrew Lloyd Webbers Broadway masterpiece, it is an insult and worthy of a public apology to all those unfortunate fans unlucky enough to have bought tickets.",Cats

The original London cast then again in 1992 and then again at the London Palladium for the revival. The film was different there were aspects added not the same as the show. But for an entertaining evening it's excellent some of the performances are excellent Jennifer Hudson, Judi Dench, Ian McKellen, Francesca Hayward were wonderful.

597,crazyorconfused,Pros and cons,2,25 December 2019,"Just got back from seeing it. I will list pros and cons. This is coming from someone that hated the idea of this movie.
*****spoilers*****
Pros:
Victoria was just the cutest thing ever. I loved her so much.Munkustrap was great I loved him.Jellicle songs for Jellicle cats was cool.
Not the song but Mungojerrie and Rumpleteazer scene is just how I imagined they would act except the last part. I will get into that in consHow much screen time Mr. Mistofelees had. In the 1998 movie he wasn't in it a lotSkimbleshanks song/ scene was awesome!Beautiful ghosts was just.. beautifulGus was more entertaining in this than the stage show.They cut the orgy sceneCons:
They cut out parts of songs, a lot of the Jellicle ball dance was cut, the Naming of cats had parts cut.A lot of talking, there were some parts that were fine.Mungojerrie and Rumpleteazer left Victoria in the room to deal with the dog. They are naughty mischievous cats but they would never leave a cat like that.Bombaluria was on Macavitys side. It felt wrong.Jenny, bombauluria, Mungojerrie, Rumpleteazer and Skimbleshanks were not in it the whole time like the stage show. Which I guess it was to fit the narrative.Grizabella. It just didn't work for me.Bustopher Jones and Jenny were funny. Those cats are not supposed to be funny. They are serious sophisticated cats.Jenny didn't like her job/ life. In the stage show she was very proud of who she was and what she did.Macavity fight didn't happenThe jellicle ball and Mungojerrie and Rumpleteazer were sung really weird.( I realize they sounded like the original though)Victoria not starting out as jellicle made Grizabellas acceptance not as powerful. To the other cats it's like who cares if this random cats accepts Grizabella.Mr Mistofelees song had barely any dancing. I didn't like it. He is my favorite character so it was disappointingno tuggofelees scenes rip to that shipcamera was shaky and hard to focusMr Mistofelees had to use a wand to do magicMy feeling toward Mr Mistofelees is mixed. I always felt he was shy and uncertain in the stage show but I think they went over the top. I thought it was really cute how clumsy he was.I went in reminding myself not to compare it. It was hard not to as you can see by some of my cons.
Overall I would give it a 5/10. I would go see it again and buy it on dvd.",Cats

The combination of amazing choreography, make up and costume made it feel real. No CGI, No Ears that moved, No robotic tails, no weird body posture. The show ran for 7,485 performances. Why did they think they needed to change it? A show that ran for 18 years on Broadway does not need much of a rewrite or a reimagining.

It's true it's not the most complex of stories, it is from poetry after all - it's more a series of set pieces - However it's charming and touching and j hud knocks memories out of the park.

Don't believe it. I'm happy I ignored them and went to see it for myself to decide..It was such a joy!! Throughout the whole film I was smiling. I never liked the stage version and I'm a huge musical freak, so I had no idea what to expect and had my doubts about going to see this one. I now finally understand the story, thanks to this movie, and appreciate the music much more!!! The colors and sets were breathtaking, the music sounded like heaven, and the actors were brilliant. Love that they casted new actors too. The CGI really wasn't bad. People need to stop complaining and realize that these cats are magical cats. They aren't the cats we keep as pets. They are 'Jellicle Cats' and do not have to look like regular cats. Have people lost their imagination?? They didn't frighten me at all, as some people said. Amazing what they can do nowadays, especially with the fur and cat ears.
Don't go watch it if Musicals aren't your thing. This is a 'Musical, Musical'.Conclusion, just go see it for yourself. Everyone has its own taste. It's obviously fine if you don't like it, but this movie certainly doesn't deserve so many bad reviews and money loss. I've seen far worse movies than this.

It follows a new character, Victoria as she follows a group of cats bidding for a chance to be reborn in the Heaviside Layer. That's the story. It's not the story. It's the songs that make Cats so revered. And they have some good singers. Jason Derulo, Jennifer Hudson, Taylor Swift, James Corden and Rebel Wilson all show up strong.It has some other interesting cast choices with Sir Ian McCellan and Dame Judy Dench. They were wonderful.Don't believe the hate.",Cats

Jennifer Hudson was incredible, and Rebel Wilson had my companions and I dying of laughter. Andrew Lloyd Webster should be extremely proud of Tom Hooper's adaptation of the masterpiece.
For those of you who have said this movie isn't worth seeing and that your kids didn't like it, I doubt you or your children have understood the broadway original correctly.

Even Judi Dench couldn't squeeze a good mention out of any of them.Critics have said the sets are ugly and the CGI flying bodies go all blurry. Even the close-ups of singers, faces framed in CGI fur, go all wonky if they move. It's like a series of auditions in close-up or even worse, cat night at your local karaoke bar.Most of the actors are (blessedly) unrecognizable but Ian McKellen, Idris Elba, Rebel Wilson, James Corden, Taylor Swift, and Ray Winstone are all in this back-ally mess.",Cats

It's got brilliant dance scenes, heart wrenching songs, impressive stage effects, costumes, and makeup. The plot really doesn't matter, and just serves as a devise to hear the songs and see the dances, but repeat viewers can find the relationships between the cats, and work out their histories and roles in the community. The movie decided to not include any of this. The editting during the dance numbers made them feel like a distraction from something else - I was focussed on the backgrounds and the fact that they were dancing, not the actual moves. The songs were turned into pop numbers, losing much of the emotion and making the emotion they did remember to include so over the top it felt insensere. The CGI was horrific and distracting. The jokes didn't work. I wish I could even laugh at it but I spent most of the movie bored out of my mind - please give me back my £4.50",Cats

628,mw2186,"If you don't get it, that's okay.",7,30 December 2019,"A guide to the movie Cats:-If you need a guide then this movie is not going to be the right choice for you.
-You may want to have a cat or like cats.
-If you did not have a chance to see the fourth longest running Broadway musical of all time...again this movie is not going to be the right choice for you.
-If you want to embrace the film (good or bad) with a group of your most awesome friends then by all means sacrifice the 110 minutes.
-You may want to grasp the concept of a character study beforehand. Have you seen The Breakfast Club? That was a character study. A character study is not a plot or a story and if you expect either one then you are going to be sad.Now...if you have read T.S. Eliot's Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats and/or seen the fourth longest running musical in Broadway history then it's going to be a real treat for you to see Dame Judi Dench as Old Deuteronomy, Sir Ian McKellen as Gus the Theater Cat and Jennifer Hudson as Grizabella and it's going to be because (just like the Broadway show) they don't dance.You still get all of the same songs that you love and it will be cute to see the actors you do know as the rest of the cast. Except for what they had to do with Macavity in order for that character to make sense on screen. That was a little weird.Sadly, the dancing and even the movement is completely lost and replaced with CGI weirdness, which is a huge part of why people loved it on the stage.At the end of the day cats are still going to win. All things feline and the billions of dollars associated with them will always be worth more than your space fantasy franchise, your comicon and your superhero movies. Sorry Jason Momoa if it's between you and Grumpy Cat, he's going to get more views than you ever will and he died last year.When you're done scrolling through this little review along with the hundreds of cat videos, memes and photos in your newsfeed you don't have to admit it out loud.",Cats

It was later converted into a hit musical, by Andrew Lloyd Webber, keeping most of the poem intact. This gives the musical a nice contrast between the 80s music and 30s writing.Unfortunately, this film has to be understood by American millenials, so a bit of rewriting was done to lower the needed IQ to understood it.A musical needs excellent dancers and singers. A film needs excellent actors. This film has none of the above.Taylor Swift is an average singer and certainly no Elaine Paige. Only reason for her in the film is to sell cinema tickets.James Corden delivered a remarkably poor performance.Judy Dench is completely misplaced.The new extra songs were naturally awful as expected.All in all it was okay.

632,Film_star,Fine,6,21 December 2019,"Honestly, I don't know how expectation here ever got beyond what the project always said on the tin. Humans dress up as cats and sing a mixed bag of songs and it's sort of a fabulous hot mess. If this premise is for you, then you'll like it. If it's not, you won't. (See also: Cats the musical.)Increasingly we are allowing ourselves to be pushed towards extremes of opinion on everything, and it's ruining our ability to see the shades of truth in between. The CGI in Cats bothered me far less than De Niro's waxy face in The Irishman (a film I liked far better than this, in spite of its needless miscasting).The scale problems didn't bother me much because I just suspended disbelief. I'm watching a movie in which cats sing, so really I'm not looking for dimension realism.Jennifer Hudson belts THAT note out, and it's a bit of a moment, but I'm not sure her sobbing throughout the song was the appropriate creative choice for the lyrics. But Judi Dench has bags of cheeky fun, and Laurie Davidson is a charismatic Mr Mistoffelees.Honestly, I left the cinema feeling like I'd seen a perfectly OK movie which couldn't be a lot better because the inherent source material isn't all that brilliant.To dismiss it outright, or enjoy kicking some pretty decent performers and dancers who enter into the spirit of it, isn't an especially balanced form of criticism.",Cats
633,Wally-E,Not as bad as what critics said.,3,20 December 2019,"Much like Venom last year, Cats is a ""worst movie of the year"" that isn't all that bad. The movie has its fair share of flaws, but the bright spots are very bright.The CGI isn't as eye bleed worthy as I thought it would be, the comedy was missplaced in some parts but in others made me chuckle, the singing was inconsistent, however, mostly good, as was the acting, and overall look of the film was decent. By far my biggest complaint is the lack of a compiling naritive. The film was unclear in what its plot was until fairly far in, and even when it did lay out its master plan I felt it was far too simple for a movie as long and as costly as this one was.What saves the movie is beautiful singing from Jennifer Hudson among others, and musical set pieces that are a joy to watch.

I decided to rewatch the musical before watching this movie and it had that much more of a positive impact.This movie was creative, unique, and fun. I loved the fantasy aspect and all the visual treats this movie offered. Give it a chance. It was a lot of fun! Even if you hated the original Cats, there's a chance you may like this film.",Cats

640,dtaylorii,What????,10,29 December 2019,"I have never read a more inaccurate series of ratings in my life!
The movie Cats was a wonderful movie of a high-quality Broadway or London theater musical.
It was not a movie like Star Wars or Aquaman. It wasn't supposed to have a big plot, it was a MUSICAL: song and dance for those of us who can't easily get to New York and London productions (and prefer comfortable seats while watching for those of us who have! 😉)
What made it even better was that the cat costumes really moved and close ups of the singers really looked like the singer AND a cat.Geez, folks! You really need to retract all your low ratings and rate this wonderful production for what it really was!",Cats
641,my_lena66,VFX will not fix this movie,2,6 April 2020,"I am so confused about the choices made here.
Even if the VFX were perfect this movie simply wouldnt work. At best it looks as if it was made by someone who doesnt care about musical or doesnt understand them. Half the cast makes no sense, apart from it being a vanity project. The singing is for the most part simply not good enough. In the show this could work for some characters as you had them sing duets or harmonies, but not in the movie. Rebel Wilson needs to chill and realize she doesnt have the voice, dancing or stage presence to carry a whole song by herself. Judy Dench I love the woman but she cant sing, why give her a role that requires her to sing? Most of the main cast cant dance, why were they cast then? Why is Rebel in this movie? She cant dance, her singing is not good enough for a solo, just why? Most of the main cast cant really carry a song that well to keep you engaged. Why was Taylor Swift in this movie? Why does her cat wear heels? She doesnt dance and her singing is okay.When you look hard enough, it seems like there were some pretty amazing choreography and dancers but the framing and the weird editing of constant cuts, make it impossible to enjoy it, its zoomed in on the ''star'' of the song and you cant even really see the dancers and the set and enjoy the spectacle of it.I hope Franceska (Viktoria) gets a better musical to be a part of, she was a joy to watch.
Spoilers:
Again Rebel why? She joke-sings. She doesnt dance in a tap dancing song, shes apparently holding the beetles and mice hostage forcing them to dance to her amusement on the punishment of her eating them? And all the other cats are cool with this? Its horrifying and uncomfortable, and honestly raises so many questions about these cats and this world I just cant. Why do we spend time on Rebels random ''oh im weird and delusional and suck at everything actually'' improv?
Why are we cutting away from songs and dances in order to have random jokes or reactions from characters and cat even see the dancing?
Why is Mr. Mistoffelees an awkward weirdo trying to get Victorias attention the entire movie? I get the actor that plays him doesnt really sing or dance but why cast him then? Or at least shuffle people around and let someone else sing his song and dance like they did in the show. They turned a happy upbeat song with a solo dance from Mr. Mistoffelees into a boring speak-sing while he stands on stage, and then repeating the chorus infinitely while staring at a stick? Ofc everyone will focus on the VFX its the only thing to pay attention to. And you still keep the lyrics of ''My manner is vague and aloof
You would think there was nobody shier''?Speaking of lyrics, why does the Macavity song keep the line where it says hes a ginger cat but then make his fur dark brown? Did no one listen to the song?
Taylor had no business being the center of attention for that song, the singing was ok, but watching a close up on her just walking around while singing is not interesting. It just makes you focus on the VFX even more. You can see theres some awesome dancers in the dark around her and some nice choreography going on then just let us see it please. I dont care about Taylors bland pretty face with cat ears.Why are some cats wearing clothes and not others? Some are just wearing shoes? In the show their ''furs'' are their clothes, hair, make up and shoes so the audience kinda just goes along with it, because it fits with the costumes. But here it really sticks out and just looks weird. Are cats aware of being naked? Is it a thing? Why is Old Deuteronomy wearing a massive coat? Whats the coat made of? Where do cats get their clothes? Who makes them? Why are almost all the male cats fawning over Viktoria? Shes a random kitten, relax.Theres so much more.... Its just confusing.",Cats

643,popadopalous,Okay Musical Remake with Weird/Dark Vibes,6,21 December 2019,"This movie has a lot of negative reviews because people were expecting a movie, not a musical. So firstly, understand it's not a traditional movie, but a musical based on the Cats play. This means there is extremely little dialogue; it's basically singing and dancing the whole time. You must have a taste for the theatre arts to appreciate this kind of work. So if you don't like musicals, you'd hate this movie.If you judge it for what it is--a musical movie--it doesn't deserve terrible reviews, but it's also not the best either. As a musical movie, it has good choreography, transitions, dancing, singing, etc. It captures the essence of the original Cats play and its weirdness. But it has issues with enunciation, unanswered questions, over-the-top weirdness, and unnecessary dark vibes.The actors didn't enunciate words clearly, making it very difficult to understand much of what they were talking and singing about, which also makes understanding the whole plot more difficult. They failed to explain many things in this movie, such as how did they all get there?, who exactly is the villain Macavity,? how is Macavity able to make people disappear?, why is only one cat chosen to begin a new life?, where exactly are they?, what is the Heaviside Layer?, etc. These questions (or most of them) can only be answered by researching the original Cats play, so the movie itself fails to answer some critical questions for people unfamiliar with the original story. This will leave you being very confused about a lot of things.This musical movie is extremely weird. People in cat costumes crawling around in all fours, scratching and licking themselves, hissing, and very strange positions. Other weird things like mice and roaches with human faces. The way the cats get close to each other's faces and mouths can be very weird and even slightly sexual. The songs, the background music, the scenes, and various characters are all just super weird! On a weirdness scale of 1 to 10, it's an 11.The movie has a dark theme that permeates everything. Dark in a creepy way, like Tim Burton style. Every scene is dark in some way. They constantly interrupt the musical flow to make it sound dark/creepy again. It goes back-and-forth with normal music/singing then sudden dark/creepy again, as if you were watching a horror movie and something bad is about to happen. These constant dark/creepy vibes are completely unnecessarily and damaging to the movie.The biggest question of all that we had was: where exactly are they? All these abandoned cats live in some dark city that they can't escape unless they are reborn by reaching the ""Heaviside Layer"" by singing about their lives. So in summary, you can think of this movie as ""Tim Burton makes a musical"" where human-cats are trapped in some type of Cat Hell/Purgatory who have to competitively sing and dance their way out. It's one super weird musical, but not terrible. It's about a 6.5/10.",Cats
644,theseus74,I quite enjoyed this.,1,20 June 2020,"Perhaps my expectations were low. Obviously there are a few ropey CGI moments and some well known older actors who can't really sing. Also, not entirely sure why James Corden and Rebel Wilson are employed as actors, truly dreadful, especially the former. Also, the American actors didn't help; dreadful. Why employ someone who can't even at best attempt a UK accent, her, that played Rumpleteaser, awful.Apart from the above negative points, I thought the supporting cast were great, the orchestration was excellent. A couple of dance numbers missing and 1 or 2 new items, but they worked. Some really stand out performances.I think this film may have been rushed out, I don't recall. It's mainly bad editing, CGI and casting.I also think, the story is easier to follow here than the stage version, it made more sense. There isn't much of a story to be fair, but this works.",Cats
645,kerrielou,Gah! Just let dancers dance already!,1,3 January 2020,"Setting aside all of the other problems, lets talk about something that seems to be an epidemic in Hollywood. Once again they insult audiences by assuming we won't be satisfied just watching a dancer dance. The dance sequences, not numbers, suffer the same problem The Greatest Showman did. There are way too many cuts and special effects. A leap doesn't have to be Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon impossible to be beautiful. One of the reasons the Broadway version is successful at all is the dancing and that's because the audience is allowed to see it in it's entirety, not cut up to the point it's barely a dance at all. Long wide takes are what made the dancing in La La Land enjoyable to watch even if the dancers weren't Fred Astaire\Ginger Rogers astounding. It just proves we love to watch people dance. You'd think with the popularity of programs like So You Think You Can Dance and Dancing With the Stars it would be obvious even to Hollywood by now.CATS the stage play is a weird experience to watch. Putting it on screen was always going to be difficult, but to virtually remove one of the only elements which made the original good gave this movie no chance of success.

652,jordynpoodle,I don't think the critics saw the same movie,5,23 December 2019,"Honestly,I went into this hoping for a train-wreck. I saw the reviews,and laughed. But this was not what I expected. Cats 2019 feels like someone tried to digitize a Broadway production of the play, but the computer focused too much on face recognition. The choreo and singing feels straight out of the musical, no modern hip hop remixes here. All the main cats get their own songs,and they may just be only introducing themselves and that's it,but they're all done well, and I enjoyed some of it a lot, especially the opening number. 'Memories' actually brought me to tears,something that doesn't happen very often.
The obvious elephant in the room is the CGI, which,yes,does look freakish at first,but by the last third, I didn't care.
This isn't the holiday smash hit the studio was hoping for, but when you realize that it is currently going up against Star Wars, there is little hope for this to make much of a mark at the box office.",Cats
653,casey-91047,The best cat movie since cool cat saves the kids,1,20 December 2019,"After seeing cats I was so beaten down by the catastrophe I had just seen. I just sat there speechless why would anyone ok this. It is important for movies to have plots that the viewer can understand. Cats certainly has a plot, I think. All the cats; like the audience, wan't to die so they can be born again. So they sing songs to Judi Dench so she can put them in a hot air balloon and send them back to there cruel creator. It is important for movies to have convincing effects, Cats certainly has effects. Why did they make the cats humanoid not just the cats, the mice and the cockroaches too. it the film cats a cat eats her army of sentient cockroaches they move just like humans and yet they are nothing but food for the uncaring cat. The same applies to the mice but they are even more human having the appearance of a small child and yet it is implied that the cats eat these children. It is important for a film to be well shot, Cats makes me wish I was shot. The cinematography in Cats is messy and it is made worse by the atrocious editing. The film is cut in a way that makes it hard to follow. It is important for a films world to feel lived in and real, Cats has a world. The nightmare creatures the film tries to convince you are cats eat mice and wear there skulls, this choice was very poorly executed (I wish I was executed) as I said earlier the mice are humanoid, and yet the cats wear the skulls from normal mice. On the surface this makes no sense unless you consider the fact that the cats are horrible mutants from a nuclear fallout. Cats has nothing any good movie has, not even anything any bad movie has. Cats may not be a movie I'm still not 100% sure this isn't a bad dream, and there may still be a small chance I will wake up. But sadly I'm pretty sure this movie is real. Even sadder it will most likely kill the career of a talented director and cause less musicals to get funded. Cats makes any positives it has impossible to appreciate.

Put this one out of its misery.",2,29 December 2019,"People might tell you this one is a must-see on the sheer power of its badness, or that it is destined to be a midnight feature, or a cultural curiosity like ""The Room"". Let me tell you this, above all - this movie is BORING! It isn't even bad in any way that you can enjoy ironically.I'm not sure I can unpack many of the plot details, as nothing is very clear by the time the credits roll. These cats are ""Jellicle cats"", which despite its repetition never really gets a definition. They are jockeying for the opportunity to be transported to the ""Heavy Side Layer"" which is a sort of reincarnation or something. Basically they take a balloon to... heaven or maybe out of cat purgatory? Also some of the cats have magical powers.The plot is largely nonsense, but the play hasn't been celebrated for decades on the power of its story, anyway. Most of the running time is a series of cats introducing themselves in song, and... that's it. The story structure is far from the worst thing going on here, so I'd rather address the real hairballs:The special effects - No, I wouldn't say they are as bad as many are saying. There is a bit of 'uncanny valley' effect at times and some of the movements look artificial in CGI, but that is indirectly the bigger problem. Elaborate dance routines do lose something when you are keenly aware that it was assembled on a computer and not actually performed by dancers. Other than that, it isn't much different than if they were in makeup and costume. A cat costume, in whichever way it is applied, makes everything sillier.The music - I'm not that familiar with the original soundtrack, but the music here is bad in several ways. The instrument set sounds dated, I suspect on purpose to capture the feel of the stage show (maybe?). The wah guitar solos and synth horns really evoke 80s era live theater, but it just sounds bad here. Also, the songs are loosely structured in a way that makes them come off improvised against fairly sparse accompaniment; none of it is memorable or fun.
The one recognizable number is cranked out by the over-emoting Jennifer Hudson. Technically, it's a good performance but you can't get past the preposterous cat getup. Taken together, ultimately, it just looks ridiculous and the context for the emotional number is dubious and confusing so the number sticks out in a bad way.The direction - It'd be far down my list of gripes, but I'd be remiss not to mention that the physical scale of things is pretty wonky throughout. Jellicle cats are variously as large as people and small as mice. The kind of attention to detail is on display that allowed Judy Dench's character to alternate between having human hands and furry hands depending on the scene.There is plenty more to dislike here, but suffice it to say, this movie isn't worth your time.The closing scene, which feels infinitely long, has Judy Dench's Deuteronomy half-singing-half-speaking a song about how cats are not dogs. This closes out the tragedy that is ""Cats"". The denouement has nothing to do with any of the characters or events we have sat through, as far as we knew, dogs don't even exist in this universe. It is pointless, drab, silly, seemingly endless and is thus a perfect coda to ""Cats"".",Cats

663,DapperDuck713,An absolute Litter Tray of a film.,1,28 September 2020,"""Cats."" That single word summons more paralysing terror in those who watched this film than any horror movie released in the last 10 years. The initial trailer caused mass hysteria across the internet when it was unleased upon the world in 2019. Like the opening of Pandora's Box, once the images of those obscene CGI cat-human hybrids had escaped into the world, they could not be put back into the darkness from which they came. Despite the memes and jeers pouring in from every direction, some people were optimistic, believing that this movie could be good... it wasn't.
""Cats"" is nothing more or less than the spawn of Satan himself. In fact, that's a little bit cruel, if Satan had spawned this monstrosity, he would have disowned it and sent it packing immediately. Never have I witnessed a movie this expensive, with this calibre of on-screen talent at its disposal, failing on so many conceivable levels. The songs range from average to agonising, the cast are either miscast or have their dignity stripped away from them (or both) and the visuals are the stuff of the most fevered of night terrors. However, I loved watching it!
Yes it's an appalling travesty, yes it makes no sense, but I'm so happy that ""Cats"" exists. From the ludicrous opening scene to the final musical number, in which DAME Judi Dench addresses the audience directly to remind us that ""a cat is NOT a dog"", I was rolling on the floor, howling with laughter. It's surreal to see a 95 million dollar film take this much of a swing and miss so spectacularly, but I had a blast watching this movie fall flat on its horrifying face. So although it's undoubtedly one of the worst movies I've ever seen, I enjoyed ""Cats"" immensely, but for all the wrong reasons.
So let's go to the Jellicle Ball and try to make sense of the disaster-piece that is Tom Hooper's ""Cats.""
As I mentioned previously, the cast in this nightmare are generally talented, but all of them are dreadful here. It's definitely not the actors fault, as even Arnold Schwarzenegger, the God of one-liners, couldn't have made putrid dialogue like ""I believe you truly are a Jellicle cat, a dellicle cat"" sound good. Whilst all of the performances are terrible, they're all awful for different reasons.
James Cordon and Rebel Wilson feel severely out-of-place as the, er, comic relief? I'm aware that a great many people find these two actors irritating (Cordon in particular), but I personally don't have anything against them. However, they are incredibly annoying here, they feel like they're in a completely different movie to everyone else, performing their usual shticks of making fat jokes and falling over.
This is probably as good a point as any to mention how appalling the comedy in ""Cats"" is (the script is littered with atrocious cat puns that make Halle Berry's ""Catwoman"" look like a Christopher Nolan movie.) That isn't to say that ""Cats"" is devoid of comedic value, as listening to Ray Winstone singing or watching SIR Ian McKellen lick milk out of a bowl made me laugh more than most modern comedies do, but I think it's fair to say that these moments weren't supposed to make us snigger.
I feel really sorry for Francesca Hayward, Naoimh Morgan and the other young actors who have never been in a movie before and presumably thought that ""Cats"" was going to be their ticket to stardom. I sincerely hope that they'll get another chance to prove themselves as actors, and that the rest of their careers won't be ruined because of this mess.
I'll admit, Idris Elba and Jennifer Hudson were almost good in ""Cats"", Elba is clearly relishing the opportunity to chew up the scenery and Hudson attempts to give an emotionally rich performance. Sadly, both actors are undercut by the woeful CGI that the entire film is caked in, which creates many deeply disturbing moments throughout the run time.
Elba's character removes his fur coat about two-thirds into the movie, revealing his dark brown fur underneath. What makes this so unsettling is that A. his fur coat looks like it's been made from the pelts of skinned cat corpses and B. he looks stark raving naked as he prances around and flirts with Taylor Swift (whose barely in the film.) Do I need to explain why a nude-looking mutant Idris Elba feline fiend is distressing to watch?
Jennifer Hudson also sports a fur coat (I have so many questions) but thankfully she never takes it off. The problem with her character is that throughout the entirety of ""Cats"", a tendril of snot is careening down her character's face. I understand that this is supposed to signify how sickly and depressed she is, but for crying out loud, I couldn't take my eyes of that train of ooze whenever Hudson was on screen. It was really distracting!
Imagine being the CG artist who crafted that strand of mucus, you work long hours, miss your kid's karate ceremonies and become increasingly distant with your spouse. But it's all worth it, because you constructed a photorealistic trail of snot for the 2019 film ""Cats""...
Before I move onto the other elements of ""Cats"" that make it an atrocity against all of humanity, I'd like to voice my anger that Tom Hooper took SIR Ian McKellen and DAME Judi Dench, two of the greatest actors of their generation and absolute national treasures, and destroyed every ounce of nobility they possessed. These are two actors that are respected across the globe, they've starred in some of my all-time favourite movies and have both been nominated for Academy Awards (with Dench winning for ""Shakespeare in Love."" She should have won again for ""Skyfall."") Yet in ""Cats"", they are transformed into computer generated monstrosity's that will haunt my dreams until the day I die, spouting horrifically bad dialogue and doing things we never wanted to see these legendary thespians doing. I laughed, but inside, I was crying!
Even though the characters have the charisma of a pile of polystyrene ducks and the visuals should be number one on the Schmidt pain index, if the narrative in ""Cats"" was compelling, the film might have been saved. Sadly, there is no plot in ""Cats"", I still don't understand what a Jellicle is, the main goal of every character is to DIE and the pacing is about as fast as a mouse on its way to a cat convention. The story unfolds like this: a cat appears to sing their own praises, then another cat appears and does the exact same thing. Rinse and repeat. Rinse and repeat. Rinse and repeat!
""Cats"" is based on a supposedly popular musical, so at the very least, the music in the film should be good right? WRONG! The songs are aggravatingly overlong rambles that fail to make us care about anything that's happening in the film, they don't have any logic behind them and they aren't engaging to listen to. I will admit, I tapped my feet twice whilst watching ""Cats"", but that may have been because I was being sucked into a maelstrom of madness and mania, rather than because I actually liked the songs.
But without a doubt, the biggest flaw of this hate crime of a film is the visual design. ""Cats"" is a truly petrifying watch, the CG cats that scuttled out of the darkest pits of hell are some of the most blood-curdling beasts I've ever witnessed! The cats with human faces, feet and hands (plus a wedding ring in Judi Dench's case) shatter the Uncanny Valley into pieces. Our brains cannot comprehend what we're seeing, we know that the characters aren't human, but we can still distinguish their human features, causing our minds to go completely haywire. This isn't helped by the fact that the scale of the characters is constantly shifting from scene to scene, which adds to the hallucinatory atmosphere. This hair-raising horror is at its most unnerving when Rebel Wilson's cat unzips her own fur to reveal a dress and more fur underneath, eats a cockroach plastered with a person's face upon it and terrorises a group of mice with children's faces... WHAT?! WHY?! HOW?!
I feel bad for any young children whose first trip to the cinema was to see ""Cats."" If I'd seen this movie as a kid, it would have scarred me for the rest of my life and made me never want to see a film ever again!
In conclusion, ""Cats"" is as traumatic, baffling and disgraceful as everyone says it is. It's possible that this will go the way of ""Plan 9 from Outer Space"" or ""The Room"" and become a cult classic, but as of now, ""Cats"" deserves all the criticism it receives. It's a complete CATastrophe.

There were a couple of songs that could have been cut because they didn't really help the movie along and song fatigue set in and it slowed the movie for me. But the actors solos were great fun and the sets were amazing. I don't know why there are so many bad reviews! They are supposed to be Cats and yes they were somewhat human and all different but have you ever seen two cats the same other than all one colour? Cats takes you to another world and you see the personalities of many of the actors in the movie individually. Highlights for me were Rebel Wilson and James Cordon as well as Ian McKellan and Jason Darulo doing backup soprano was hilarious! Mr Mistopheles was a surprise and very enjoyable but Jennifer Hudson knocked it out of the park for me!,Cats

My expectations were low going into the theater this morning and when it was over, my friend and I just laughed at how truly horrid it was. The CGI is beyond bad and Taylor Swift needs to NEVER act again. Seriously, she was the worst, her accent was painful to listen to. The only redeeming part of the movie was Jennifer Hudson and her big number. The ending was laughable to say the least. The sad thing is there was so much talent in this movie and it was just wasted on cheesy CGI and painful to watch cat moves. Tom Hooper, you should ashamed of yourself",Cats

672,djwdoc,"Let your memory lead you, open up, enter in...",9,26 December 2019,"Evidently most reviewers are dog people. What is a Jellicoe cat? Who knows, exactly-except that to be such a thing is at least to be interesting, and to inspire the interest of others. The whole thing hinges, ultimately, on the evanescence of life-cat's lives, in the movie's premise, and on the ability, it seems, of a Jellicoe cat to throw itself absolutely sincerely into life and experience, to see and to live it, and to be alive in the moment. Perhaps it helps to be old enough to see autumn leaves at your feet to SEE it. It is right that the choice is Old Deuteronomy, as I doubt the too young can even see the story. Hate it or like it, but you can't deny these actors fully invest themselves into the roles they play, and the actions they do-catching and eating dancing cockroaches, for example-with as little evident self-consciousness as if they were the cats they play, in a world where there are dancing cockroaches and mice in bands. If you are able to step out of the awareness that these are humans in cat suits, then the idea of the briefness of life, and of empathy for others' experience of life, might have appeal. Turn on subtitles, so you catch all the words, The plot is simple enough: one cat's life experience is so emotive to other cats that the oldest among them selects that cat as worthy to live another life. The song ""Memories"" serves the plot beautifully. Every actor gives the story's actions their all, and the plot is clear as one could ask, if you accept that these are creatures with paws, twitching tails and ears that happen to dance gracefully and sing beautifully, and believe in a weird religion. (It's a movie; you can't imagine, really?! You should need no interpreter...) If you can enter this other world, and if you see them and hear them as they are, then you might just be a little bit of a Jellicoe cat yourself.",Cats
673,bustopher,All there and all better!,9,4 February 2020,"I've just spent a productive two hours watching the late 2019 movie ""Cats"". Now I had read the critics panning it, saying they weren't real cats, and the story was weird.Clearly they hadn't seen the live show, something I've seen many times from the original Sydney production at the Theatre Royal (where I spied British comedian Mel Smith in the audience) to Gosford Musical Society's to the UK video with Elaine Page and in the Big Top at St Ives showground, among others, amateur and professional.I still know the lyrics pretty well, and was pleased that singing along - apart from a couple of sections (see below) was an easily achieved joy.There were a few minor insertions of dialogue in between songs, which provided a bit more character exposition than what you get in the musical. They weren't obtrusive, and quite helpful.*MOST* of the production is faithful to the musical, except many previous third person descriptions of a character sung by other cats now see those lines given directly to the character.They changed the melodic structure of ""Mungo Jerry & Rumpleteazer"" for the worst, but made a few cuts here and there for the better.There was a delightful addition of a song following ""Memory"" (first rendition) sung by a soprano which was completely new material for the movie.In some places the lyrics are obviously drawn from parts of the original T S Eliot that Webber didn't use in the musical, but this only happened in a couple of places.The sets apparently used modern CGI, and naturally much greater visuals than ever possible in a theatre. The look of the production is slick, and wardrobe and make-up are a real tour-de-force.It's also a little bit darker with cats, especially Macavity, pushing their case to be reborn for a new jellicle life, and Old Deuteronomy's responses, something not in the musical.With Judy Dench as Old Deuteronomy we miss the dulcet baritones of this role, but she plays the dramatic side impeccably which adds to the understanding of the story. Ian McKellen was Bustopher Jones, and did his song exceptionally well for an old salt.There are certainly differences, but they are mainly related to transferring a live show successfully into a movie. If you've seen the musical you'll love it. The familiar ""Cats"" is all there. If you haven't, then you'll either ""get it"" and love it too, or miss the point, as a number of the aforementioned critics obviously did.Andrew Lloyd Webber's score and Eliot's lyrics have always combined beautifully. Webber's highly syncopated arrangements appeal to all listeners of many genres.This is what ensures any production of this highly original concept will border on masterpiece levels.I absolutely loved it.",Cats
674,rainbowzs,A show and dance stage musical movie adaptation. Don't expect too much of a plot and try to skip bits with James Corden and Rebel Wilson.,3,25 June 2020,"I'm a theatre and dance fan, and have seen the live stage musical. Cats has always been a big show and dance about different kind of cats with a hint of a storyline about getting to the Heavyside Layer. So yeah, not really much plot so wasn't expecting that but the movie actually created a plot or two. The stage musical is not the best ever, but it's fun with great ""cat"" dance choreography and some truly great songs.
Lots of comments have been made about the whole cat CGI thing, but really - it's HUMANs playing CATs! They could have probably made a whole bunch of cat CGIs dancing with just the actors voicing them if they wanted to. Have you even seen the Cats costumes on the stage musical? The movie ""costume"" is an upgraded version!
I enjoyed the big song and dance numbers in the movie. You can tell that most of the cast are professional dancers and I thought all the ""lesser"" names (probably big ones on stage) did a really good job and were the highlights. I probably enjoyed them the most. Don't really like Taylor Swift's interpretation of Macavity - which annoyed me, as it's one of my favourite song in the stage musical, but it's alright. Probably better with an earthier jazzy singer. The new song is okay, nothing special like Memory.
I truly hate any scenes with Rebel Wilson or James Corden. The added ""bits"" to make them ""funny"" just made me cringe. So if you delete their scenes, it's an okay movie. Probably give the stage musical a 6, and the movie a 3.5. Kudos to the dancers though.",Cats

True it is a bit furrier than the original spandex clothed stageplay and movie, but those were ""odd"" at the time but nobody then seemed to mind. At the original London opening in 1981 Andrew Webber said he was scared that the audience wouldn't buy it and start laughing. Instead they gaped in amazement and then applauded it.Open your minds and let the movie take you in. Many critics came around after seeing 2001 a second time only to declare it a masterpiece. This 2019 version isn't a masterpiece and you could argue that the original 1998 direct-to-video musical film is better, but both are wonderful and deserve applause. Yes this 2019 one is a bit silly and seems designed for a younger and/or more ignorant and/or simpler audience but it still has amazing dancing and singing.

The show is basically 'an experience' no discernible plot,. a group of poems put to music and sung/danced as a burlesque of show numbers,. crowd claps,. goes home happy. What the director has done with the movie,. is linked together a narrative that tries to link (slightly) all of those elements from the show.. It LOOKS stunning,. from the first glimpse of the humanoid cats dodging car lights in a gloriously colourful version of London in neon. What the movie press have jumped on is the first trailer bandwagon (which wasn't good) and all the negative press,. ""let's sink this puss"".. without looking at the content.. The CONTENT IS CATS! Once you acclimatise to the look of the characters, (which have been improved since that first trailer), it's no more or less fantastical than AVATAR was. The lead three characters are wonderful together and each character song is performed and staged with glee and aplomb,. (Even James Cordon is bearable) Highlights for me are the new song (Beautiful Ghosts),. OLD DEUTERONMY introduces the character beautifully (Judi Dench and Ian McKellen almost steal the film),.SKIMBLESHANKS: The Railway Cat is a Tap dancing highlight,. MEMORY may not work as a listen too version on record but it plays beautifully in the film and Jennifer Hudson was so touching. Taylor Swift and Rebel Wilson all deliver in their Burlesque/humour moments. My biggest niggle was that the scale falters with Mungojerry and Rumpleteaser dancing with the lead where a ring or a necklace suddenly reduce the cats to mouse size.

Was I weirdly turned on by some of the cat people when I watched the trailer? I'd be lying if I said I wasn't. Plus, the orchestral iterations of two of the major themes from the musical were kind of amazing sounding. I decided I'd watch it in theaters. I thought, ""Maybe I'll be pleasantly surprised by what I see, considering how strange it looks.""But something else happened.Within 2 minutes, I immediately knew this was going to be one of the worst films I'd ever seen in my life. It was so off. So awkward. So strange that the cats no longer appeared attractive to me anymore. And did they have the songs redone to be more orchestral? Nope. They actually kept all the songs sounding like the same 80s songs they had always been. Sythesizers and all. The CGI? Unfinished. There were even portions of animation that weren't completely rendered that were allowed into the final cut. When they danced, there were multiple times I literally watched as their feet didn't connect with the ground below them correctly, indicating the set they were on wasn't actually there. There were parts where you could tell the faces of the actors that were rotoscoped onto the CG-motion-captured bodies of themselves sometimes slightly *moved out of place*. I've told all these things to the people I've known who asked me how it was, and they generally responded around the lines of, ""Ah. Dang. Well, I'll definitely not see it then."" And I always responded:""No. You have to see it.""The reason you have to see it is because it's so inherently bad that it's actually a marvel, like watching ""The Room"", or ""Troll 2"". It's an experience that everyone needs. But I strongly recommend you watch it with friends and/or family. You'll laugh. You'll cry (at how awkwardly bad it is). You'll be amazed at how the cinematography and lighting are actually phenomenal, but unfortunately lighting a film that just... doesn't deserve it. ...or maybe it does. Maybe that's what makes this film so fascinating; it's like if director David Fincher and cinematographer Simon Duggan joined forces to shoot a 4 year old running around with action figures and talking about how Play-Doh tastes.It must be seen at least one time. It's truly a film to be remembered. I mean, who knows. Maybe it'll go on to become a cult classic for just how bad it is. But again: must be watched with other people.

705,womeninfilm,It's... interesting?,4,17 January 2020,"If you don't like musicals, don't bother with this film. It's incredibly unlikely you'll get enjoyment out of it. However, if you're fan of the original production you may like or even love this, and the only thing you'll take issue with is that the songs are sung differently or may find them inferior to the original show tunes, or just the CGI in general (which is very understandable)
As a fan of the original production, I was horrified by the trailer and found it awkward and ugly looking, and that's two words that are good to describe this movie. Good grief. But is this film irredeemable trash? No. Let's break it down:1. The Jennyanydots segment was the worst scene in the film, it deserves its own paragraph. The cockroaches... the mice children... traumatised me. I was begging for the scene to be over.
2. Rebel Wilson and James Cordan are so unfunny in this film. I don't really blame them though, because no matter how talented you are, you can't fix the god awful dialogue. During Rum Tum Tugger's song, Wilson heckles him with stupid cat puns that made my soul leave my body as I lay beside my friend in the movie theatre in our recliner seats. For a moment I'm at peace, but I am awoken by Jason Derulo yelling ""Milk!"" and I remember the reality that I'm stuck in. God is weeping for me. But fortunately Rebel Wilson is teleported onto a boat by Macavity and we don't see her for most of the film. The same happens to James Corden's character. And onto my next point:
3. The story does not work as a film. Turning something like Cats into a film is a bad concept because there is no cohesive narrative. When something is turned into a film, it should be cohesive for non-musical fans. The movie flopped, and that just proves my point. This movie attempted to have a story, but it didn't work and things aren't explained well. The mungojerrie and rumpleteaser song and the Skimbleshanks song are random and add nothing to the plot. I mildly enjoyed the scenes because I'm a fan of the original musical, but a non-fan is probably going to be bored and confused. Rebel Wilson's character for some reason doesn't recognise Macavity even though there's wanted posters for him RIGHT OUTSIDE HER HOUSE. And another thing that bugged me was at the end, where Judi Dench is forced to walk the plank because she refuses to allow Macavity to go to the heavy side layer (don't ask) and as this is happening Mr Misoffelees tries to magic her back. It takes a few goes for it to work, but Old Deutoronmy finally appears behind him and the other cats. All seems fine, right? Not really, since she would have been long dead by the time Mr Mistoffelees magicked her back.
4. The CGI, lol. What is there to say? The faces sometimes glitch and the Cats' feet glitch into the floor in one particular scene. The CGI sometimes looks decent but why couldn't they just do practical effects? You know, have actual unique makeup and designs that don't look uncanny? But no, we're stuck with awkward looking CGI in which I'm constantly trying to debate on whether it looks okay or not in every scene.
But to be more positive, let's look at why I gave this film four stars:
1: the choreography is pretty good. The Skimbleshanks scene really impressed me with the tap-dancing. That was cool. At the jellicle ball (I think) the choreography also felt alive and energetic. There is talent in this film which is what makes it infuriating. Which brings me to my next point:
2. Such wasted talent. Fracesa Hayward... my poor girl... her first ever film and she was so good in it. Such a nice voice and a great dancer and it's completely overshadowed by the CGI. Jason Derulo also has a really great voice. James Corden and Rebel Wilson CAN be funny!!! I swear!! And Idris Elba,,, im so sorry. And Jennifer Hudson genuinely did a great rendition of Memory.
3. The cinematography was good I guess. I liked the use of colour.
That's about it. That's my review of cats. It could be better but I'm tired and can't be bothered, and hey, this movie didn't try so why should I? Go see it if you're really interested. It definitely will be an experience if you know little about it as possible. I was at least semi-entertained by the film, but this film won't do much for you if you like normal, well written films.
Well, if there's anything to be learnt from this experience, is that cats are certainly not dogs. And naked humans should not wear cat skins.",Cats

708,HighCountryBound,Save Yourself! This THING Called a Musical is Horrific!,1,22 December 2019,"Cats, the movie was even worse than Cats, the theater musical. Seriously!To say that Cats is bizarre falls far short of the truth! This vapid, incomprehensible, illogical, train wreck of a terrible acid trip called a ""musical"" is absolutely the worst, most horrific thing I have exposed myself to...ever!The CGI is downright terrible, James Corden is awful in every sense, and the wonderful talents of many cast members are totally wasted on what amounts to the latest so-horrible-it-really-IS-horrible movies along the line of Ishtar, Gili or Pluto Nash.
Three quarters of the show consists of character introductions, with only slight storytelling thrown in. The final act...thank goodness!...wraps up this insipid assault on the brain with its eponymous, overwrought song, ""Memory"" at the very end.
The best (and only good part) of Cats, is when it ends, and the audience gets to flee the theater, and go try to erase their 'memory' of ever having seen this disaster!

715,lionspride,Beautifully made fantasy musical,10,20 November 2020,"Cats is a sung-through musical (a musical play with virtually no spoken dialogue) composed by Andrew Lloyd Webber, based on the 1939 poetry collection Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats by T. S. Eliot. It tells the story of a tribe of cats called the Jellicles and the night they make the ""Jellicle choice,"" deciding which cat will ascend to the Heaviside Layer and come back to a new life. The set of Cats consists of a junkyard filled with oversized props to give the illusion that the cast, costumed and made up to appear as cats, are the size of actual cats. The musical includes the well-known song ""Memory"" as sung by Grizabella, the so-called Glamour Cat. As of 2019, Cats remains the fourth-longest-running Broadway show and the sixth-longest-running West End show. The film is directed by Tom Hooper-in his second feature musical following Les Misérables (2012)-from a screenplay by Lee Hall (screenwriter of the 2000 film Billy Elliot) and Hooper and features an ensemble cast, including James Corden, Judi Dench, Jason Derulo, Idris Elba, Jennifer Hudson, Ian McKellen, Taylor Swift, Rebel Wilson, and Francesca Hayward along with other leading singers and dancers of varying disciplines. In the revised book of the musical, Victoria (Hayward), a young white cat, is dropped in the streets of London by her owner in the middle of the night. The alley cats witnessing this introduce themselves to her as the ""Jellicles"". Two toms, meek magician Mr. Mistoffelees (Laurie Davidson) who develops a crush on Victoria and the loyal Munkustrap (Robbie Fairchild), and two queens, the snooty Cassandra (Mette Towley) and Demeter (Daniela Norman), take Victoria under their wing and show her the world of the Jellicles as they tell of the Jellicle Ball, an annual ceremony where cats compete for the chance to go to the Heaviside Layer and be granted a new life. Francesca Hayward is an English ballet dancer and actress, a principal dancer in the Royal Ballet at Covent Garden in London. The classically beautiful dancer makes her film debut in Cats. Robbie Fairchild is a principal dancer at the New York City Ballet also making his film debut. Academy Award winning actress Judi Dench was cast in the original stage musical but had been forced to pull out due to a torn Achilles tendon, to be replaced at the last minute by Elaine Paige. Lloyd Webber and Hooper decided to make the wise and beloved Old Deuteronomy a woman and offered her the role. Ian McKellen played Gus the Theatre Cat. Idris Elba joined the cast of the film as master criminal Macavity the Mystery Cat; he possesses mystical powers and is the antagonist of the musical. Taylor Swift, one of Billboard's Greatest of All Time Artists, appears as mischievous femme fatale Bombalurina, who performs a song and dance number dedicated to Macavity: a distraction to incapacitate the party with catnip. James Corden is Bustopher Jones, Steven McRae is Skimbleshanks and Ray Winstone is Macavity henchman Growltiger. Jennifer Hudson as Grizabella the Glamour Cat delivers an iconic performance of the show's signature song ""Memory"". Andy Blankenbuehler, choreographer of Hamilton, choreographed the film, after Wayne McGregor was forced to back out due to scheduling conflicts. Blankenbuehler also choreographed the stage musical's 2016 Broadway revival. Andrew Lloyd Webber announced he would be writing a new song for the film adaptation; the new song is titled ""Beautiful Ghosts"", written by Taylor Swift and Lloyd Webber. The song will be sung by Francesca Hayward, followed later in a reprise by Judi Dench, with a credits version sung by Swift. Inexplicably, the film, IMHO a breath-taking realization of Lloyd Weber's legendary 1981 musical which deepens ever further its connection to Eliots source material, received overwhelmingly negative reactions from critics. The film's original release purportedly contained numerous CGI errors and glitches. After poor reviews, Universal notified cinemas on opening day that an updated Digital Cinema Package with improved visual effects would be available for download within a few days, urging them to replace the current print as soon as possible. Cats grossed $27.2 million in the United States and Canada, and $47.4 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $74.6 million, against a production budget of about $95 million. Deadline Hollywood calculated the net loss of the film to be $113.6 million, when factoring together all expenses and revenues. I have no doubt that time will deliver a much more appreciative verdict on this dazzling and beautifully made fantasy.",Cats
716,shandy8,Cute movie,8,9 July 2021,"I was not a fan of Andrew Lloyd Webber's 'Cats' when it was such a huge success so many years ago, so I was not expecting much from this movie (especially after the scathing reviews it received upon its released); however, I was pleasantly surprised when I tuned in and watched this movie version on cable.The first thing that grabbed me was the music. It had been thirty years since I had heard those songs (apart from the ubiquitous 'Memory'), and they are great. The music is just wonderful and it jogged my memory in a very nice way.The costumes are a bit creepy at first, but, once I got over it, I liked the look of the whole production. Much like the show, the dancing cats inhabit a stylized London alley, but, unlike the show, some of the songs take place in locations that suit their individual stories.If you are a cat lover, you are likely to see an old friend among this group of T. S. Elliott's 'Practical Cats'.I think the failure of this movie is timing. If 'E. T' were to be released today, it would probably be greeted with the same pretentious cynicism that greeted this movie.",Cats

The cast was good, the choreography was great as were the incredible sets and staging...well, then there's the fantastic the ALW music, not to mention the source material from TS Elliott, no less. These are the good points. Throughout artistic endeavors humans have anthropomorphized animals, it's not easy and the result is subjective. I suspect that this is the crux of the bad reviews and the critics panning of the movie. Such an endeavor is certainly amorphous, but the outcome is not unwatchable. The costumes are well constructed and the choice to interpret the combining of humans and cats was up to the creative team. Even the stage cast had their own hands and feet, which seemed to cause consternation among the masses. The weakness in my opinion was some of the casting, especially Jennifer Hudson and Judy Dench.

No one thought to themselves that a movie about cats was going to be a little on the, I dunno, weird side?First and foremost, the cgi was a little ratchet, but you get past that after a short time. Now THE singing by Jennifer Hudson was purely beautiful and brought tears to my eyes! The song, Beautiful Ghosts, written by my girl, Taylor Swift, and sung by Francesca, was hands down my favorite part. You could feel and understand the pain and beauty behind those two characters and it was magic. It literally filled several movie goers eyes with tears with how good it was. Did i mention Jennifer Hudson's singing of Memories 😭 oh, i did.. 👀 BEAUTIFUL AND POWERFUL.One thing i would have liked better and yes i know it's based off a theater production, but more dialogue because some of the singing was... confusing and hard to understand when attempted to be sung by these A-list celebrities. Would have been a nice transition from theater to a movie adaption. My 9 year old daughter at one point whispered to me, ""mom, why are they singing the whole time.."" lolAll in all, it's not that serious y'all. It's a movie about Cats, not a hero saving the world.

Eliott: ""Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats"" - so if you were expecting a clear storyline you would be disappointed. However, Andrew Lloyd Webber had woven them together along with the music to create a coherent whole. The film version breaks out of the confines of the stage into a wider Old London setting; the choreography and costumes make for a visual, even balletic, spectacle, with strands of humour, menace and pathos.

747,Johan_16,"""All that I wanted was to be wanted""",7,25 December 2019,"I have seen the stage production ""cats' twice before seeing this movie. Once about 25 years ago and once as recent as earlier this year. In both cases, I did not like the show despite normally being fond of musicals. There appears to be no plot and the show seems to be just a series of mostly nonsensical songs about cats. I was so puzzled why it is such a popular musical - the fourth longest running on Braodway, sixth longest running on West End, an international success through it's traveling production, and winning 7 Tony awards including best musical - that I felt I was missing something. My research revealed that there is indeed not much of a plot, but that spectators love the catchy music, the impressive dancing and the remarkable costumes. I also found out that the musical is based on a poetry collection, ""Old Possum's book of Practical Cats"", by TS Eliot and is therefore less about the storyline as it is about the individual poems brought to live in the music.It is with that backdrop that I went to see the movie, expecting not to like it. It did not help that I have been reading horrible reviews of the movie especially criticizing the lack of a plotline, the humanoid cats and the poor CGI.I was very pleasantly surprised by the movie. I did not expect much of a plot, but it was much better than in the show as I could better understand the singing, there was some additional dialogue and an additional subplot that added more context and more of a story line. I feel like I now finally understand the show. I actually liked the humanoid cats as I thought it brings out the best of both worlds: the dancing is really good and preserving the human body as much as possible helps to bring that out. On the other hand, adding the fur, the cat ears and the tails adds an extra dimension with a nice blend between the cats that are being portrayed and the human movements. I did also mostly like the CGI as it gave the director more creativity on how to use the environment.Despite all the negative reviews, I actually really liked the movie and may go see it again. The music and singing is catchy, the dancing and choreography amazing, the acting excellent, especially from some of the less known actors such as Francesca Hayward and Laura Davidson, and the plotline much clearer than in the show. The movie made me appreciate the stage production more.Some things that did bring the rating down for me include the weak plotline, which seems unavoidable considering the source material, and the sometimes poorly implemented CGI, especially if you pay closer attention to the details. There were so many problems with the CGI that the studio released a new version within the first week of the show having hit the theatre to fix a number of them, something I never heard of being done in the past.The lyrics of one of the songs in the movie says it well: ""All that I wanted, was to be wanted"". This movie wants to be appealing to a broad audience, similar to the stage production, but somehow is perceived as not good for the same reason I struggled with in the stage production - a poor plot.",Cats

And, we have the evil Macavity in the background, kidnapping fellow contenders to increase his chances of scooping the reincarnation prize.The singing and dancing were superb and amazing to behold, great choreography.

756,getintherelewis,One of the worst movies I've ever seen,2,3 December 2020,"This movie made me... uneasy.The character design is awful. The human faces on unrealistic cat bodies with CGI fur is deeply unnerving to the point where I wanted to look away. The way the cats move looks awkward and almost creepy, because they don't look like cats nor hold their bodies as a cat would, but they attempt to interact with the environment like a cat. It's a confused mess visually, even beyond the design of the characters. The scale is bizarre. Sometimes the cats are the size of a small child and sometimes they're five inches tall. I didn't like the visual effects or sets or basically anything else about it. The long dancing sequences were boring and looked bad. Also, the mice and roaches were unbearable to even look at.Almost every character is absolutely insufferable. I thoroughly disliked the entire main cast and I hated how some of the cats were portrayed, especially Jennyanydots and Bustopher Jones. A lot of the performances lacked the necessary energy to make them enjoyable. Comparing it to the musical version makes the movie seem so.... dull. Despite the comedy factor of the creepy design, this is a boring movie. I actually fast-forwarded through parts of it because I was so uninterested. None of the jokes are funny and the dialogue is kind of baffling.Finally, the songs sound bad. This is a major sin for a musical movie. The singing performances are poor, which is unfortunate because there are a lot of talented people involved. I thought most of their voices didn't fit the songs they were given and most were hard to listen to. The sound mixing is awful and literally every single song sounds much worse than in the stage version.

766,tealea-90342,"Well, my opinion changed?",7,3 January 2020,"I watched this movie on New Years Eve with two friends (that I forced to attend with me). In the moment, I was kinda bored. I found the songs too long, the JUST dancing with no signing or dialogue was too often. There is so little dialogue in this film (collectively about the length of the shortest song, which I believe to be a minute and a half). In the moment, I could get over the CGI issues, though the clothing and accessories looked like a social media camera filter. So I wasn't that fond of it. I was expecting a level of terrible that wasn't realised, but I wouldn't have said it was good.
Let's get to the part where my opinion changed. I didn't hate the film, I just wished it was a little less boring. It's been a few days since I watched the film and I felt the urge to download the album on Apple Music (doesn't have all the songs, which is disappointing). Since then, it's an understatement to say I've become obsessed. I finished watching the movie thinking I'd never bother to watch it again, now I can't wait for its release to DVD. It's not that I've become interested in the musical itself, because really, they're not THAT different (trust me, I've looked at the musical and really, I have just as much to pick at that as I do the film), it's just that I have a new found appreciation for it. The singing was good, the acting was pretty good, the story was okay, the CGI wasn't THAT bad. I liked all of the beautiful areas they went to.
I'd say watch it, don't expect a master piece, but don't expect it to be as terrible as people say it is. Because it's not terrible, but it certainly isn't amazing. There were mistakes they made in production that could have been handled better, but really, you can ignore that if needed.",Cats

The CGI, of course, is very distracting especially for the two, agonizing hours of runtime and most of the cast just feels completely wasted. The movie should just be renamed to ""Character Introductions"" as that is pretty much what it is for a large portion of this movie.

I've since read any number of reviews of the film and they are all negative and I can't see why. For that reason I'm writing this review.First I'll mention the films weakness, in my opinion. Dame Judy Dench, Idris Elba, and Sir Ian McKellen (likely the three biggest names in the show) really don't have the vocal chops.The point of a musical is to enjoy the singing, the dancing, the choreography, and the set designs. Even the weakest singing (as mentioned above) was more than adequate. Taylor Swift did a great job singing about Macavity - and I'm not a fan of hers. However Jennifer Hudson stole the show (singing wise) as Grizabella and her rendition of Memories was the best I've ever heard. As good as the singing was the dancing was absolutely out of this world with special note going to Steven McRae (Skimbleshanks) for his tap dancing and Francesca Hayward (Victoria) who totally carried the show on her paws. There were a too many entertaining bits to mention, but we found the whole movie absolutely wonderful and entertaining.As cat owners we were even entertained by the movement of the ears and tails - how they did this... (CGI?)Just a totally wonderful way to spend an afternoon - much better than watching lasers and things blow up...",Cats
783,swmyers,"Very off-putting the first time around, but upon second viewing...",6,14 April 2020,"I never got the chance to see this film in the theater. But, when it popped up on pay-per-view, I went ahead and watched it. I enjoyed the original musical on Broadway and figured I would check out its film adaptation. What can I say? It was every much the disaster I had heard it was. It was awkward, disturbing, disjointed. However, the next day, a friend was over and said he hadn't seen it. Since I had it for 48 hours, we went to watch it again. I have to admit, the second time around, it was much more enjoyable. Now that I'm over the extraordinarily weird appearance of the film, I could take in more of the musical numbers and dancing. The dancing is actually extraordinary. It's tragic that the incredibly talented people who put their time and energy into this film had it subverted by bad visuals. I would also argue, that the directing is as bad as people say. Rather than relishing any of the musical numbers and focusing on any of the dancing, the quick cuts and edits are almost nausea-inducing. It's a shame because the dancing is really quite wonderful. The few times you get to really focus on it, you wish you could see more. The bottom line is, watch it more than once. Once you're used to the bizarre look and the indecipherable singing, the second time around there's much more to appreciate.",Cats

You have to accept it is a fantasy and just go with it. I did like the acting, choreography is superb and the visuals are amazing and give so much more to the setting of the piece than the stage show could ever do. The singing is very much done in character - and brings a bit more realism than some musical theatre would. If you don't like musicals - don't bother, and I would go further to say if you don't like the actual premise of the 'Cats' musical don't bother either. If you like both, see it and make your own mind up.",Cats
789,GeekThePeople,Far more fun than anyone wants to admit,8,2 January 2020,"I went into this with a lot of trepidation. I've never seen the stage show, but I have watched the video of the musical, that was released many years ago. I love musicals and I'm a fan of Andrew Lloyd Webber, but I didn't care for the video at all and have never been a fan of this musical. I've simply never understood the appeal. Plus... I hate cats. I find them repellant in every way.All of that said, my 16 yr old daughter was intent on seeing it, but even she wasn't expecting a lot. She just loves the song ""Memory."" So, ultimately, me going to see this was to take her and my attitude was one of morbid curiosity. At worst, I was expecting to find it as obnoxious and pointless as actual cats and, at best, I was hoping for *so bad it's good.*After the first few numbers, to my absolute shock, I found myself smiling and laughing at the silliness of it all. Rebel Wilson's character's feature song has some ridiculous, slapstick visuals. Her presentation of ""dinner & a show"" was precisely my kind of pun.I'm not going to get into every detail, because I feel like that's the problem. So many people are picking apart a movie that should just be 2 hours of eating some popcorn & candy, tapping your toes, seeing virtually every character devouring every inch of the scenery, and just plain leaning back and having fun with it.If you hated this, you went into it expecting far too much. I had zero problem with the CGI, which I fully expected to find distracting. I've heard people say that the people faces on the cats is creepy. Ummm... THAT'S the show!The only understandable and earnest criticism I've heard is from people who love the stage show and found the changes frustrating or even upsetting. I get that. This isn't the same as ""the book was so much better"" (one of the most pretentious phrases in the English language). When you take a show that is one of the longest running, most beloved musicals of all-time and present it as a film, really the only changes should be whatever needs to be done to the sets to modify them for the big screen. Significant plot changes or a central character changing genders is going to doom your movie to fail because you've just alienated your core audience, and therefore the bulk of your revenue.For myself, however, given that I have no affection for the source material, I was able to watch it from an entirely different perspective. None of the changes bothered me in the least because I barely remembered the original to begin with. My only memory (no pun intended) was that I didn't like it. So, if some of it was overly silly, or a storyline was cut, or a gender changed, it didn't register with me. This freed me up to simply have a fun time with what basically amounted to kitty American Idol.My only problem with the movie itself was that I felt that the ending was flat and felt unresolved. Without giving too much away, after speaking with a few others in the theater, they agreed that one additional scene (literally it would have taken 10 seconds) would have tied the ending up nicely and not left the audience going ""What happened to (insert character here)? Is that really it?""Bottom line? If you want to go see this movie, I say go into it understanding that you're not going to watch an Oscar contender. This isn't a masterpiece of cinema, nor is it intended to be. It's a couple of hours of lighthearted entertainment with some really entertaining music, a charismatic cast (many of whom you will recognize, let that be part of the fun), weirdly attractive cats, and nothing at all to take so damned seriously. Stop overanalyzing and stop with the hyper negativity. Walk in, kick back, and just have a good time!",Cats

I'd never seen the musical, and I'd only heard snatches of the poems as references in other works of fiction. I had low expectations (given the harsh reviews), but I found the movie charming. The CGI didn't bother me any more than AVATAR did (which is to say not at all).Most of the criticism leveled here is really aimed not at the movie, but at the 1981 play and the T. S. Eliot poems. Of course the plot construction of CATS is not normal... The poems are the reason that each scene introduces a different archetypal cat (each one is a different poem about cat personalities), and why there are no character arcs, and only a bare bones overlying narrative structure (that's how the play organized the poems into a ""story"").It's true some of the numbers ran too long and outstayed their welcome (notably Jelical Cats) but condemning a film simply because it's structure is not like every other movie is truly narrow minded, and leaves no room for variety in artistic expression.Some of the savage criticism I've read here remind me of the many uncomprehending, brutal reviews 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY got when it premiered.HRH.",Cats

793,kellic-spamcatcher,The funny thing is if this was animated it would have far more popular.,6,21 December 2019,"I saw cats last night. Most likely am going to see it again sometime this weekend. Critics are so full of crap its not even funny. First off the sexual comments that every critic seems to be saying. What does it say when critics are finding something to be sexualized more then furries?
There was a kitchen scene was god damn nuts.
I was uncomfortable with some of those camera angles on Rebel Wilson and some of the implied self thigh rubbing....*coughs* Yeah well. And the less said about the mice and cockroaches the better.But beyond that umm no. They are cats + ballet + musical. I'm getting the impression that folks who went to see this film to review it have never seen a ballet or stage musical before. Just because you grab someone by the waist or are in close quarters with them doesn't equate to sexual.I think critics are confused because this is where the term anthropomorphic comes into play. You have people who look like cats who are acting like cats and it's causing problems with ""reading"" the body language of the people in the movie. This is all on the director and choreographer.A lot of the reviews are saying the CGI is bad. Umm no. Not at all. The fur is perfect. The complains about some of the actors wearing fur vs some are just naked. First I saw someone complaining about being neutered. Do you really want to see anatomically correct cats in this movie? Are you sure you aren't a closet furry or something?
The choice to go with characters wearing outfits and some not.....look at who is dancing. The folks who do the most dancing are the ones who are ""naked"" The main characters who are not dancers are the ones who get the outfits. This is purely a functionality thing. Both it saves on the cost of CGI and it allows the dancers more freedom to move.Now my philosophy has always been if you have to explain that the movie was actually good, it probably wasn't.The above simply explains away some the critics baffling statements. But don't mistake that for me thinking this was a great movie. It wasn't. It was OK. It was fun to watch.That said there was plenty wrong with this movie.
For the plot.....Its Cats. The plot has always been almost nonexistent. They could have, and should have expanded on that. Was it bad? No. Its a straight forward concept. New person thrown into a new situation so the audience is learning about her environment as she is learning. A cat at the end of the evening is picked to.....move on by Judi Dench during that time cats are auditioning to be picked. During that time plans are afoot. This is not a complicated plot. Its a plot designed to carry music numbers in it from A to B to C to D. That is all.Now one suggestion would have been to added a little more Disney musical in that the music numbers are interspersed with dialog. To give a bit more breathing room between the music numbers as I think it was breaking the poor critics brain.Next was the cuts in this movie. A lot of, IMHO, bad edits. Jennifer Hudson when singing the iconic Memory was cutting away from her for reaction shots. It broke the mood. There are other examples of that that felt like the camera should have lingered longer.
Speaking of Jennifer Hudson. Wonderful job but, and it was mentioned by another review that I rolled my eyes at but is legit. She cries as she is singing. Sure. Fine. While it brings emotional weight to the scene......we really didn't need the runny nose. Really it was distracting to see that.The interesting thing that I found with critics. Is there are factually inaccurate statements in their reviews. Things that can be quantified. One review complained about the lack of locations. The only major change in location was a railway track on a bridge. Other then that it was just an ally and a theater. That is factually inaccurate. I counted 10 distinct locations. So why the inaccuracy. I suspect that folks were so intent on the cat characters (Ears moving, tail moving, fury moving.) that it distracted from actually paying attention to the film. I wasn't bugged by this because its anthro cats....So? I think anyone not furry needs to see this at least twice.
The reviews are blasting this movie when I've seen far worse movies with far worse CGI, far worse stories, and far worse characters all the while getting far better ratings.
What's the difference? People are losing their crap because its people CGI morphed into cats.",Cats

They added some story line to the stage production's story and I think they did a decent job at that. Even if you do not like the fur technology, I don't think it's reason enough to dismiss the whole thing for just that. Yes, it's not the best movie of the decade, but it is far from the worst.

I didn't really mind the CGI of the actors' faces, maybe it was thought that something like that would be demanded from today's audiences. or was it just that Taylor Swift and Idris Elba couldn't dance? But for me it was a minor thing and didn't interfere with my enjoyment at all. There were only 2 things that I'd have changed: someone should have got Jennifer Hudson some better crying eye drops, as her runny nose was off-putting, and Idris Elba as Macavity's fur could have done with being a tad longer as Idris Elba looked as if he had no clothes on, but no bits as it were 🙀.

Also, I find many of the negative reviews have a similar tone and verbiage, as though they were written by a bunch of people sitting around brainstorming to see who could top each other with their insults of the movie.

802,djbear88,It is a spectacle.,10,20 December 2019,"I had to write a review because I hate that people don't understand the theatricality of the original show and the movie. The stage show is a spectacle. It really has no story. It is a song and dance show with performers in form fitting spandex costumes with tails, ears, fur and makeup. The movie takes the show and heightens that spectacle with realistic sets and locations. In place of the spandex, it is now CGI fur and tails. It's not any weirder than the stage version.What I loved about the movie is the fact that there is a story now. It is seen through the eyes of Victoria. I loved the changes to the script to really connect the cats. Adding to the Macavity story and making him more present in the story. Victoria's journey with Munkustrap as we meet all the Jellicles. Mr. Mistoffelees getting a stronger story line added so much to his solo song.The performances were amazing. Robbie Fairchild was perfect as Munkustrap. His vocals, dancing and acting performance really helped to draw the audience into the story. Ian McKellen's Gus had me in tears. His performance is truly stunning and the work of a master craftsman. Jennifer Hudson's Grizabella was phenomenal. It was so emotionally moving. Francesca Hayward was incredible as Victoria.

Does it feature stunning appearances from Jennifer Hudson, pouring her heart (and snot) into the only 3 serviceable minutes of the film, and Ian McKellan going full CAT! in a performance that he lovingly revelled in? YES.
Listen. The entire film is CGI, even the champagne Corden forces down his throat. The only things left (regrettably) untouched are the actors' faces and hands. A harrowing vision of the uncanny and demonic. The music's incoherence and overall badness should not come to a surprise, Cats is a well known theatrical anomaly. We have Taylor Swift and Jason Derulo playing alongside Judi Dench and Ian Mckellan. There has never been and never will be a film like this. GO SEE IT. I wish it was playing in IMAX so i might have a chance of ascending to the Heaven-side layer.
If nothing else, please support Ian McKellan as Gus the Theatre Cat. He is truly a vision. And Jennifer Hudson, who was actually good, deserves so much better than the movie she got. Also hats off to Derulo's cockney accent, most inspired.

813,MorgAmanda,Not just bad,1,8 February 2020,"I feel like just saying this movie was bad is not giving it enough credit.Yes this movie was bad, it was awful. But honestly it was so awful that it turned into a ridiculous almost dream-like experience. For a while I was convinced that we had been duped, it was just a joke, that it was impossible for this movie to actually have been made. I couldn't believe that it cost $70 million to make this below amateur schlock. But it was real. It was real and it was shocking.Like if not for the bad story telling, lack of plot, and seemingly never ending pointless musical numbers, the craftmanship was just not good. It looked rushed and just thrown in there or at the very least unfinished. The actors CGI feet seemed to be floating throughout most of the film. Splotchy green screen rendering left bodies looking comically pixelated around the edges. There was even a scene in which an actor's pants looked completely detached from their body, I'm talking full on blob void between body and clothes. Their faces were just floating on the bodies, almost zero practical effects, just highlighting each and every mistake in disproportionate glory.But back to the bad storytelling. So I went with a group of 4 other friends because we were interested in seeing if it was really as bad as everyone said it was (spoiler alert: its worse). And now we have this running joke that the entire movies plot was either 1. You have to bow to cats when you see them, or 2. Cats are NOT dogs. Because those are literally the only lines in the entire movie that convey any sort of message that isn't a seemingly improvised dance and song or confusing dialogue about whatever the heck a Jelical is.Just trying to list all the errors in this movie is giving me a headache because there are so many, so I'm just gonna stop trying.I'm not going to tell you to not watch the movie or that I didn't enjoy seeing it. Because i had a great time, but not because i enjoyed the movie itself, more I enjoyed making fun of it with my friends, who were uncontrollably laughing to the point of tears and some old lady yelling at us about how we ""ruined the movie"" (yeah no that actually happened) but so was most of the theater, almost everyone was giggling at some point. Anyways long story short: if you want to see a good movie this might not be for you. But if you want a comically (or painfully) bad movie to just laugh at, I'd definitely reccomend it.",Cats

How can you recreate the glory of a stage musical like Cats?

Judi Dench was amazing, Ian McKellan was wonderful, Francesca Hayward was super endearing and Laurie Davidson's Mistoffelees was magical.Of course there were some bits that were mediocre, like Taylor Swift and Idris Elba's roles would've been far better served by better dancers/singers/actors.

I was expecting a horror show and hilarity, but in the end it's really... just Cats.Ok, the cgi is a bit weird at first, but really not THAT bad after ten minutes or so. I wonder if the people rating this so low are really just realising that Cats is simply not a very interesting musical. It's a series of song and dance routines based on a collection of poems with only the merest hint of a plot holding it together. This sort of thing goes down better in a theatre because the live nature covers up some of the cracks, but those same cracks are highlighted by a movie: Cats is simply a bit dull with a handful of decent songs a d always has been.My only real criticism of the film is the decision to change Old Deuteronomy from a male to female character. You can't do that without affecting the songs (s)he sings and I didn't think they sounded right in a female voice, the words just didn't carry the weight of a bass voice.",Cats

Calling 'Cats' a movie maybe too much. Usually movies have a narrative, a story, some kind of construct. But not here. Here you'll only get nightmarish scenes which barely tie together, served with nonsensical music which isn't even that good, and special effects that aren't finished, and would propably look horrendous even when done.

837,harpermjd,Not Quite Sure What The Other Reviewers Are On....,7,23 December 2019,"I doubt that many of the reviewers on here have actually seen the stage production - I certainly haven't. This is essentially a stage production but with a well-imagined set, CGI costumes and effects.It is true that to understand what is going on in the earlier parts of the film, you have to listen reasonably closely to the lyrics. There are plenty of songs in quick succession, some of which are lengthy and may test the concentration. But the songs - which is what a musical is principally about - do stand up.For those that argue that the story is on the thin side, how come the theatre production is one of the longest on both Broadway and in London's West End? What did you expect?This glamourised version of the stage production is put together well, the CGI'ed cat costumes are authentic, some of the dancing and singing is extremely good, particularly that of Francesca Hayward, who plays the white kitten, Victoria - and in the same way that a new kitten brings energy to a household, she brings new energy to the Jellicle group.Taylor Swift, as well as co-writing the new song, Beautiful Ghosts, also produces a good cameo, and the tap dancing of Steven McRae (Skimbleshanks) is worth watching too.The musical's high spot is undoubtedly the song 'Memory' and though the music swells beautifully and that top note is hit with awesome power by Jennifer Hudson, I could not help being distracted by her somewhat snotty face - you don't see such close-ups in the theatre - but I felt it was a tad unnecessary.On the whole though, I enjoyed the film, as did my teenage children. Certainly not the greatest film ever, but anyone who could only give this 1 out of 10 either does not appreciate music, or does not understand the limitations of putting a stage show on the big screen.",Cats

841,alexmiller-74035,good if I was mentally insane!!,5,24 December 2019,"Just before I went to see this film I had a vision that cats was a terribly put together film where the run time consisted of songs after songs and no dialogue in between for background information. That was precisely what I didn't get. Instead the film was well crafted AMAZING visual effects and the best acting in a musical I have ever seen.All jokes aside I found this film awful to the point I had to gouge me eyes out! Yes this film had pretty good songs and a great musical score, which is mainly why I'm rating it a 5/10, the songs weren't memorable apart from the song memory which I have heard before on a tv show. There wasn't really a plot to the film that stood out to me and the visual effects for the humanised cats were so bad that throughout the film I could see the feet from them jumping all over the place instead of on the floor like it should be! The thing that could of made me won't to rate cats higher was if Tom Hooper (the director) had them in costumes like the musical instead of spending millions of pounds so that people can make a meme out of it.Overall if you liked the musical then you would probably like the film, up until the point were you have to be high or drunk.

As you know, the live-action/CG hybrids were obviously not improving. For movies that are done with production, post production takes more than six months to finish, u gotta render each effect that's done by computers.Not only that, but this movies seems comparable to Foodfight, how everything glitches, things that suppose to be what they are just doesn't come out right. For example you already saw Motion Capture actors still have their hands and not fur, like Chewbacca, Ewoks, And live action Grinch and Cat in the Hat. Yes, they had costumes, but that's the point Tom Hopper the guy running the show; (not Spielberg who was trying to produce this for 2 decades) should have choose live action, so that he could still use the sets that look real. Some exceptions. Cockroaches have woman faces on them and The Mice got kid faces which adds a whole lot more to the uncanny valley the movie has already showcased.Me and my friends don't know about the show, from what I can gather is that it has a cult following, like The Room. There's no plot, characters and explanations on how their world works; especially when we see ""only one"" human throw away Victoria. Where's the rest of them? Do dogs walk in four legs as the cats? It doesn't matter because the great Andrew Lloyd Webber never explains the audience: What The HELL'S GOING ON WITH THE FIRST THIRTY MINUTES! to quote Nostalgia Critic: JUSST EEEEEX PLAAAAAAAAAINNNNN!And furthermore I would like to question The MPAA's decision is label it as a family picture? This feels like Don Bluth's lost film only he can make dark and weird. Rebel Wilson does something's in her number that are going to have some many years of therapy on this because the kids in my theater (totally of 17 people to make how much of a bomb this was) stood in the back petrified. You ""can"" show children this if they love Taylor Swift and Rebel Wilson, but question the decision they made with this Catastrophe of a movie. I hate saying puns after watching a animal picture.Never let Hollywood make mistakes like this the producers responded to the backlash too late and studio pull this from their ""For Your Consideration for THIS YEAR'S OSCAR'S.

There is so much wrong with this movie that I will not go into the details, but the saddest thing is that they should have been obvious.

It became boring very quickly, it's very rare that in a cinema I want to get up and walk out early and the only reason I didn't was because of the family in there with me.

The cats look more like monkeys. The heads are undersized and the tails are rarely feline. Did anyone involved in the movie ever look at a cat or a picture of a cat? Maybe even a drawing of a cat?In the theatre every actor literally became a cat and always stayed a cat whether moving or still. They had the right sized head with ears in the right place and they had paws, four of them!All the actors I have seen being interviewed about their performance in this movie has been suitably embarrassed.

879,sc1fr34k21,Unjust reviews by facilitators of Broadway elitism and their parrots,7,6 May 2020,"The movie ""Cats"" is a clever adaptation of a complex idea that our view of animal species reflects our own complexity. The characteristics historically assigned to cats are here given back to us as a story that successfully reminds us of the commonality behind the diversity of individual human experiences. There are different aspects of this commonality portrayed but the main moment of our unification is the oldest idea of hope and the yearning for new chances.Having watched the movie after reading and rereading a bunch of negative reviews I've come to the conclusion that the movie is being hated unjustly. Most of the user reviews online are hardly articulate focusing on irrelevant things, giving short emotional outbursts or just trying to be funny because its fun to ride the negative review hype train. Practically no argumentation is given on why the movie is as awful as those users would have us believe.Reviews by established critics are not that bad but fall into the nostalgia rabbit hole or judge this movie by the place it has in the directors career. Others focus on the quality of the CGI which is good in as much that it never becomes a problem (only perhaps for those who need an angle to write their payed for negative reviews). Some again think that their cynicism will explain to them what is happening in the movie and because of it fail to address the content in a meaningful way. I agree with reviews saying that dancing choreographies could be more interesting and I agree that they do sometimes confuse the viewer who is trying to relate them to the story, but these are isolated moments and not an overall problem. Most reviews, I think, fall short in understanding the movie at all and the point it tries to convey.When I have first seen the trailer the very weirdness of the human-cats is what actually caused some amazement in me. It felt like a strangeness I had to see or explore. Returning to my first paragraph, it think now that it was a strangeness that was clearly showing me that there is some unique familiarity which the movie beckoned me to understand. This understanding it definitively delivered.Finally, I think the critics have been uncritical and have facilitated an elitism of genre and medium which was then unsuccessfully parroted by anyone who thinks an internet connection entitles him to have a relevant opinion. Mine, of course, also falls into that category but at least I'm not a parrot - yes, it could be that I'm a cat :)",Cats

To be honest I was looking forward to watching a movie that was just terrible, with my experience with really good movies. But this was next level. This movie is just... bad. When I said they got the classification wrong, I mean this movie has unintentionally turned out to be a horror film. The way the CGI on the cats make them move is just... creepy. And I am used to looking a cats with four paws on the ground, not cats singing and dancing. I highly don't recommend, unless you want to see a movie that will forever change your mind on cats. I can't fully rate this because I would have preferred to watch my beautiful white wall than this. Go ahead and watch it if you are 15+ years old.

I don't think the animation is too scary, although I wouldn't recommend taking young kids to it. It's actually quite mesmerizing once you get into it, and I think the animation is quite pretty.

888,ashmarnell,For lovers of song and dance,8,3 June 2021,"As the positive critic reviews observe, this movie is not for everyone, but if you love song and dance numbers, this is one of the best filmed musicals in years. It beautifully mixes disparate styles from ballet to tap to break dancing, with Andrew Lloyd Webber's exceptional music to fit each style. Like most song and dance musicals, there is no plot to speak of, although this movie version improves on the play version by expanding the part of Victoria, the abandoned kitten looking for a home, and Francesca Hayward shows why she is considered one of the great ballerinas in the world; she is not much of a singer, but her little girl voice fits the song that Webber and Taylor Swift wrote for her. Robbie Fairchild.is perfect as Muskustrap, both as a singer and as dancing partner to Hayward in several of the numbers. Laurie Davidson is wonderful as Mr. Mistoffelees, the magician cat. I think a primary reason so many people were so disappointed was because the marketers insisted on emphasizing such cast members as Rebel Wilson (a disaster), Taylor Swift (with one short scene) and James Corden (ditto), when the true stars of show are the dancers, and Webber's musical adaption of T. S. Eliot's Book of Practical Cats..",Cats

Rebel Wilson is a shaky singer to begin with, add dancing and she couldn't keep her tone. James Corden did so many prat falls he ruined the song. Even professionals seemed to have trouble holding a note while jumping around. The new song is nice, but it takes away from the pain of the protagonists. Sir Ian McKellen was charming and played his part perfectly. The weird Macavity drug, kidnapping subplot was unnecessary. We miss out on Growltiger's Last Stand because of it. At the climax of the film, Jennifer Hudson played her part as it was meant to be played. Full of emotion, Hudson hit the high note perfectly.

I especially love Mr Mistoffellees, Rum Tum Tugger, Monkustrap and Grizabella. The singing and the dancing is the main reason for enjoying a film like this.There's so much out there saying the CGI is rubbish or creepy that I think it's clouded judgement. OK, not perfect, but really not that bad. I went with my 11 year old daughter and she loved it and loved how the cats look.The story, or lack thereof, is the same as the very successful stage show so I'm glad they didn't change that and try to invent a story. That's just what the story is.The only time I thought it looked it odd was when the scale felt occasionally wrong (like when they were walking along rail tracks - they looked more mouse size than cat size.)Please go see this with an open mind, not a clouded one and just enjoy the show.",Cats
894,thoroughlyme,Never As Weird as You Want,6,20 December 2019,"Outside of a few extremely weird moments, CATS is neither as consistently weird as you want it to be nor as good as the film thinks it is. You get used to the CGI after 5 minutes and after that, it's just the stage show. If you like that, you'll like the movie. I liked the movie a bit more than I liked the musical (for reasons that will become apparent) - but I also really don't like the musical.The script adds a bit more of a story than what is found in the musical, but it's never really able to turn the film into anything more than a collection of vignettes where various Cats explain why they should be the ones to ascend to the Heaviside Layer (a version of Cat Heaven) and be given a chance at a new life.The CGI isn't as monstrous as you fear, though there are plenty of times it doesn't work. Hooper films this movie in exactly the same method he filmed the Les Miserables film - lots of extended closeups and very long-lasting wide shots. The wide shots do a good job at showing off Andy Blankenbuehler's choreography, but the closeups are very unsettling.Unfortunately, the movie is only REALLY weird for about 30-40% of the time. The rest of it is fairly monotonous and it just sort of numbs you. I'd argue it's worth seeing for those weird moments - because they're REALLY weird. But, at the end of the day, if you don't like the musical, there's no chance you're gonna like this movie - because it's just the musical with slightly weirder costumes.",Cats

Exactly what happens in the movie is what happened in the written story by an author who loved cats as did his grandchildren. I really don't see what is creepy or disturbing about people acting as cats compared to stage actors dancing around the stage dressed up as cats. I found the movie visually satisfying, the singing sublime and the cast were great.

In short, this movie brought tears of joy and feeling good to my eyes. And that is not common. A good tragedy and a good show has been made despite a really strange material to start with. I mean, it is just a heap of silly rhymes, but the script writing made it to a story. The music is fantastic. Young and skilled dancers.

As most of us, before going to watch it, I checked the rating and reviews in IMDB.
Wow, how many horrible reviews it has received.
So, I went there, prepared to watch one of the worst films I have ever tried.This was not the case though. The film is not the average ""Hollywood"" musical with a blend of dialogues and songs. It is almost just songs. Be prepared for that.
I have not seen the theatre play, so I cannot compare. But found this film quite good. It is not a fast paced movie. It is not intended to.
After the half , it becomes more emotional and captivating.
I think the movie delivers what it is intended to: a ""theatrical"" experience of a musical. Relying more on the music and lyrics, than complex dialogues, to transfer the ideas and emotions to the viewer.

The story isn't even important. Cats has always been about the dance numbers. And the dance numbers didn't disappoint in this, I'll say that. Actually those were probably the best parts: the professional dancers, the non ""famous"" people did better than the Big names. The CGI was just atrocious and honestly ridiculous. Idris Elba's Macavity was the worst look wise. Broadway make up was fantastic! This movie could have gone amazing in the costume department! The CGI just wasn't necessary! Memory was disappointing... it's a melodic song and Hudson cuts it up into too many pauses, and makes it overly dramatic, more than the song already is. She acts it instead of singing it, same that Anne Hathaway did in Les Mis.
Of the famous names Taylor Swift was actually the best, Jason Derulo I couldn't understand. He needs to articulate better. Rum Tum Tugger is a difficult song sure, but I've heard better. The famous names were simply unnecessary, they didn't add anything special. You're better off watching the Broadway filmed production.",Cats

Robbie Fairchild was a great Munkastrap, leading no only Victoria but us as well through the lives, of the Jellicles, and what a mixed bunch they are, naughty Mungojerry and Rumpleteezer, pompous Bustopher Jones, sweet Mistofeles and the amazing flying feet of Skimbleshanks, not to mention Gus and Old Deutaronomy.

It can't be intentional, and it has to be so mind-bendingly weird that it becomes almost sublime. I have to say, Cats accomplishes this. It is rare that each element of a movie works harmoniously to make something so confounding. I am giving this movie a low rating because, objectively, it is really very bad. But I am also encouraging you to go out and see this movie, because it is unquestionably entertaining.The CGI has somehow produced feline-oids that simultaneously appear too realistic and hilariously cartoonish, and the net result can only be described as the mind full on rejecting everything that is being perceived. Andrew Lloyd Weber's score has received some updates, though in none of the ways it perhaps should, and the result is (somehow) simultaneously dated but with a cloying modern sheen. The acting swings from laughably austere to hammy. The feline-oids change size and scale dizzyingly and at random. Ian McKellan's participation in this picture might qualify as elder abuse. And Dame Judi Dench (!) must be seen to be believed.This is all only the tip of the iceberg- the rest defies description.

The CGI reduces instead of enhances this but the movie still will be a classic favorite due to extraordinary dance performances of Stephen McRae and Francesca Hayward as well as exquisite singing by Taylor Swift, Jason Derulo and Jennifer Hudson, and the accomplished acting of literally nobles Dame Judi Dench and Sir Ian McKellen.
Choreographed by Andy Blankenbuehler (Hamilton) and directed by Tom Hooper (Les Mis), there is a huge array of high caliber talent here in this Film adaptation of Andrew Lloyd Webber's musical Cats. It all started with some TS Elliott poems...",Cats
914,uniqueflgirly,I enjoyed it,8,30 April 2020,"I went into it after only watching the older movie years ago. I'm an avid fan of musicals and adore the big names that starred in this. The cat outfits, the moving tails and the set were all super cute.I enjoyed the story of the abandoned cat discovering the world and meeting all the contestants, making friends along the way, helping the homeless cat, and coming into her own.Another musical I'll be adding into my collection, no matter what others think of this movie. I don't let other people's opinions change mine.. everything I watch is with my own eyes. I enjoy things for what they are. Watch it and make your own decision.",Cats
915,adam-w-smith1981,My Eyes Are Bleeding,1,21 December 2019,I went into this movie with zero expectations and this was one of the worst movies I have ever seen and I've watched Gigli twice. I am part of a podcast team that talks movies so we had to watch this movie as part of our show. I can't tell you what happens in the last 2/3 of the movie because we walked out. The CGI cats are awful looking and you can't help but shake your head at all of the big names in this  box of a movie. I hope they got paid big bucks for this disaster. Save your money and go listen to the soundtrack if you are into this kind of thing. We ended up going to see the new Star Wars movie. If I could have given it zero star I would.,Cats

Loving the live musical, I didn't expect this movie to NOT be weird, and it 100% delivered on all of its weirdness. The music is beautiful and haunting because ALW is the MAN when it comes to music. If you go into this movie, ready to inspect every detail and wondering ""Wait.. how did this happen, or why did this happen?"" then you are very much so missing the entire essence of this show. This movie takes you into a different world and you don't leave it till the very last second. Have fun, enjoy the weird, and let the memory LIVE AGAIN.

Film critics will hate this, because they don't get theatre. As will the casual cinema goer. This isn't meant for them, and think its harsh to give is such bad ratings. The music, the dance, the acting - Jennifer Hudson especially - amazing! How can it desever 2*???

928,megandouch,Wonderful but weird,7,24 December 2019,The music in this is amazing! Can't fault it at all! The dancing in this is stunning as well! But the storyline and the costumes are different. Found myself a bit bored at times. If you can get past the humans as cats then you might enjoy it. Think I'll need to watch this a few times. Vanessa the main cat is a beautiful dancer and singer and carries the film. And the actress who sung memories has a beautiful voice!,Cats

Okay sure, it's a little odd to see people with CGI cat bodies and yes they could have been better done perhaps but is it really ""horrifying""? It was a little jarring at first but I quickly got used to it. The singing, dancing choreography etc were excellent. This isn't a typical movie you take your kids to see for fun. It is based on a broadway musical and should be approached as art. Shocking perhaps but also beautiful.",Cats

The wonky facial expressions, lingering songs, and downright creepy mannerisms were quite the hoot. Almost all of the audience was there to laugh at the movie. For good reason. There were two people in the theater who were taking it seriously (a young couple on a date. Oops, that's a poor choice of movies), but they turned around by the end of the ""film"" and started chuckling.It's so strange how a piece of media like this can exist. Despite how unwatchable it is, the movie was weirdly hypnotizing. Well, I guess we are one with the jellicles now. Whatever that means.",Cats

935,jefatic-725-569510,"A masterpiece! Forget the negative ""reviews"".",8,4 January 2020,"It is not often I feel the need to post a review on IMDB, but after reading all the negative remarks and seeing Cats last night I felt duty-bound.
The sets, dancing, and cats themselves are visually stunning - not to mention personable, beautiful and obviously dedicated to giving extremely heartfelt performances.Francesca Hayward as the new young cat (Victoria) binding the story together (a stroke of genius) was mesmerizing and has to be the most gorgeous face to be seen on the screen since Zoe Saldana in «Avatar»). She is also an incredible singer and dancer and worth the price of the ticket alone.Other fantastic adaptations were Skimbleshanks - the railway cat, Ian McKellen as Gus - the Theatre cat, and a surprisingly bold move using Judi Dench as Old Deuteronomy. I would have given the film a 10 except for the fact that I thought Rebel Wilson's singing (Jennyanydots - otherwise another great scene) could have benefited from autotune.In conclusion, if you like Cats - the musical, I don't see how you could be disappointed by this wonderful and-state-of-the-art cinematic production. The portrayal of the cats is spellbinding. The CGI and spectacular scenes are mesmerizing and the singing and dancing are all one could hope for in a modern day musical.Forget the negative reviews, most of which aren't really «reviews» at all.... «my grand-mother cried in the bathroom for two hours»........» This is paraphrasing, but when such comments get 150 «helpful» likes, one has to wonder who is doing the reviewing, and who is doing the liking.

Not only do the cats with human faces, hands and feet, look incredibly disturbing, but there are mice with human faces, and cockroaches too!!!!
The proportions of the cats keep changing too, relative to their surroundings! Sometimes they're normal and other times, things like peas, cutlery and train tracks are enormous compared to them!! The train track scene is particularly evident, where the cats look 2cm tall!!
There's a dance scene with a guy totally un-cgi'd in his track suit, dancing at the back!
They defy gravity, float above floors, into floors!
Some wear clothes, others naked, except for fur. Rebel Wilson's character unzips her fur skin, to reveal another fur body with clothes!! Bizarre!!
The instrumentation is totally 80's, with cheesy synths and other dated sounds!
It was hilarious 🤣

It was funny, moving and weird.Francesca Hayward's singing and dancing was beautiful. I loved all the balletic dance. Taylor Swift can sing without an autotune and actually has a nice voice. She contributed the lyrics to one song, and it added poignancy, if any were needed, to Memories.Idris Elba - I always thought he was a nice guy, but his performance as Macavity leads me to a rethink (joke). He can sing, he can move, and he can be creepy.For all the other actors - know and not so well known - it was clear that they were chosen for the best to play that role.At the time of writing, the film has an overall rating of 2.8.

I really do hope she gets a supporting actor now, hopefully Kanye isn't in the room! I really just wish people will go back with an open mind of how this movie has opened my eyes to cinema. Jacob, my local police department sergeant really had his eyes opened. He's usually ""oh hell naww"" etc to musicals, he's more a Rocky type but even he couldn't hold back them tears.

Yes, there's no normal dialogue since it's a basic musical propped up by a major Hollywood budget. The actors in this seem tired and clearly are phoning it in for a paycheck.

If you are familiar with Old Possums Book of Practical Cats then you will realise that each character that is being introduced is from the text within that book. For those that do not know the characters then I guess it can go over your heads and be a bit bewildering. If you are a fan of the musical and/or dancing then this is a must for you. Steve McRae as Skimbleshanks is as usual brilliant and also Francesca Hayward plus all the supporting dancers.Jennifer Hudson sings Memories so well that real tears are coming down her face and it moves you (unless you are heartless). My favourite is Magical Mr Mistoffelees. Amazing performance. James Corden, Rebel Wilson, James Derulo, Taylor Swift, Judi Dench. Idris Elba and Ian McKellan are all fabulous.Just get into the film and think of them as characters from the book and not humans pretending to be cats. This film is for people with imaginations and for those to escape to beautiful dancing and songs. This is not for people who need a plot or storyline as it's a portrayal of characters and nothing more.I was so worried that the critics would be right but if they spend so much time writing about the lumps and bumps in certain areas that are missing then this says a lot about their minds. If you can't watch a performance without looking for Idris Elba's bits like Mr Peter Bradshaw of the Guardian then perhaps see Star Wars instead.This film is for people who love musicals, dancing or escapism. If you take a 2 year old and an 8 year old and they get fidgety then of course they will as I don't expect poetry, music and dancing will fulfil them, so have come common sense and see a cartoon instead.",Cats

I think everyone from Elba to Hudson ( even Ian M ) did a very nice part in their roles. And I don't see how y'all think actors are ""creepy"" when they used the same tech for the Naa'vi of Avatar and they are supposed to be acting cat-like hence where the set has to be larger than normal and the name of the musical/movie. ( Unless you thought the Naa'vi were ""creepy"" too. And no I'm not bashing Avatar. I loved that movie and yes, it's better than Cats. I am just talking about the black suits with the cameras so they can capture the actors' movements and facial expressions while they add the CGI.) To each his own though. I guess I'm the ~horrible cat~ for liking this more than the rest <3",Cats

I had read all of the bad reviews so was expecting a terrible experience, however to my surprise I actually quite enjoyed it. Idris Elbas performance was brilliant, as was Taylor Swifts. I have never seen the actual musical at the theatre but never the less I still enjoyed this film.

This was preceded by a 6 hour wait at A&E in agony. I would rather have gone through that again than watch cats again.The film is literally just introducing different types of cats and then moving on quickly to introduce another type of cat. And that's it! The CGI was appauling all the cats float about 2 inches from the ground, and it's just really bad and shocking for a 2019 blockbuster film. The music was very bad especially Jason Derulo, he was dreadful, it was just an attempted career boost for many of cats in that film.

I was expecting something more Like The greatest showman which this movie definitely is not and the story is hard to follow but I imagine this is perhaps the fault of the musical and not the film maker.It was nice to watch, but more entertaining was watching the incredibly talented dancers who must have put a lot of hard work in to this film.I give this 8/10 because if you like Lloyd Webber, stage musicals or just watching talented dancers then you will enjoy this film.",Cats

992,buzzgary-61934,It's an experience that's out of context for most,6,3 January 2020,"I enjoyed it as a manifestation of the theatre show in an experimental format on-screen. Its kind of like a giant music video. No one takes music videos that seriously and many music videos (Peter Gabriel's ""Sledgehammer"" for one) are interesting and memorable and ultimately about the music. This movie is a series of character vignettes and the music is really what it's all about. The character ""Victoria"" was, for me, beautiful and entrancing to behold.I feel the noses should have been cat noses but perhaps it might have offset the balance of the ""it's just people in CGI costumes"" motif too much.Anyhow, don't watch this with expectations of it being a formulaic movie. It's art. An experiment. A string of music videos about cats introducing themselves.Yes, it's ridiculous.No, it probably shouldn't have been presented as a regular movie experience because the expectations for a common movie are different.The songs remained in my head even if the movie was, like most music videos, unique, trying hard and fleetingly entertaining.It's not a great story. It's not a good movie, really.But it is art, and it is an experience. Make up your own mind.See it without the lenses of a moviegoer but of a visitor who is gazing at some crazy-ass art on the wall of a crazy-ass art museum... you may just enjoy it, in that context.",Cats

I loved the characters of Mr. Mistoffelees and Victoria. I thought Rebel Wilson's cat was very well done. For the first time ever I got the sense that there was a story, and I was able to follow it.

So much was made of Taylor Swift being in the cast, we thought she was the lead, but she only has one son, which she delivered beautifully. Go see this movie, it's well worth your time.

I even shed a tear during a beautiful rendition of memory by Jennifer Hudson. The songs told amazing stories with great performances.But the movie really hit hard with the visuals. While some of the settings were quite unique and detailed and the cats ears and tails were quite expressive, the animation lacked. The worst for me was the hands. They were human hands.

Focus is on minutiae of cgi, who blooming cares, all looked shiny and other worldly to me, had cat ears and looked furry, what more do you need. Hatchet jobs are utterly baffling. Film has nothing profound to say, but is absolutely pure entertainment. All actors performed very well, no continuity between scenes, but that was nature of stage musical. Music was fabulous throughout.Whole thing is an absurd contrivance of overblown silliness, and absolutely wonderful for it.",Cats
1002,jeanineklimach,The death of another musical for an Oscar grab,1,29 October 2020,"Didn't have much hope for this knowing Hooper would be behind it. Hooper has displayed that he does not understand the medium in which theater song and dance exist and how to translate it to film well. His weird shot angles, extreme zooms and abhorrent cuts which disrupt the overall song/dance pieces, show this. Since cats is as much a dance performance as it is a musical, these cuts make it that much more disruptive. I hardly think better VFX would make any difference and I consider it once of the more minimal mistakes in this film. Hopper himself said he wanted this to be more ""grounded"", this was the biggest mistake. Trying for a realism approach for a performance that is entirely built on fantastical elements, ergo trying to give it a plot, was just bad foresight. It's clear this was just another attempt for an Oscar grab, I guess that's the only thing musicals are good for nowadays.",Cats
1003,cubelodyte,Not another 1-star review,3,15 October 2020,"To begin with, the 2.8 out of 10 rating found here on IMDB at the time of this writing is a far greater commentary on how social media has changed the way people communicate, behave, and even think than it is of the film itself. The collected reviews of this movie should not be taken as a literal indictment of the film. Instead, it provides a singularly illuminating illustration of mob mentality in social media. Instead of hosting honest and accurate assessments of the Cats movie, this page has become a showcase for influencer wannabes sharpening their wit in an escalating competition for who can collect the highest number of likes by composing the most sarcastic and most popular 1-star review. Ironically, it seems less about rating a move than it is about people seeking to inflate their own self-esteem rating by berating an easy target.Now, make no mistake, this movie is truly noteworthy in its capacity to break new ground in the category of awful. It simply doesn't deserve page after page of consistent 1-star reviews as far as the eye can see (or mouse can scroll). In fact, this reviewer might even go so far as to say that the film had moments, literal moments, where I was actually digging the ride.
So here are the most significant flaws as this reviewer sees them:1. Name over Talent - The mistake of believing that using big-name actors for curb appeal instead of appropriately talented performers. This is not intended as a backhanded slight on the talents of such icons as Ian McKellen, Judi Dench and others. Obviously, they are quite talented. Their career accolades are well documented and therefore do not need to be bolstered by an amateur critic. The intended meaning of this comment is to suggest that this movie amounts to a spit in the eye of all the talented singers and dancers that have performed this musical for 40 years.2. CGI over Talent - Cats, above all other Webber musicals, stands out for its dancing. Sure, the songs are good, and the costumes are stunning, but this production has always been carried by the marvelous movements of its talented performers. The movie version should not need CGI to enhance anything in that regard. People can be amazing on their own.Again, the very idea that it's better to create a character for Taylor Swift so that you can put her face on a poster instead of hiring real dancers/singers (again, not a slight of Taylor Swift. In fact, her singing here is excellent) is like hiring Audrey Hepburn to play the role Julie Andrews (one of the best movie/stage singers of all time) created in My Fair Lady and then bringing in Marni Nixon (another of the best movie/stage singers of all time) to overdub some of the singing.3. Backstory and Comic Relief - As is so often the case, movie producers have underestimated the ability of an audience to handle any level of sophistication. The narrative Webber concocted to string together a collection of T.S. Eliot poems has always been a bit thin, but that never mattered. The show was entertainment enough. One can understand the desire to make rewrites when converting a book or play into a movie. The contrivances in this movie would almost have been tolerable if not for the lumbering and tedious performances of the titular comic relief delivered by Rebel Wilson and James Corden.
This reviewer is actually surprised there hasn't been more outcry over fat-shaming, but laying that aside, the humor simply wasn't funny and dragged the movie further into the (spoiler) garbage can than it might otherwise have slipped on its own.4. Jennifer Hudson as Grizabella - This was, for me, the biggest disappointment Cats served up. One of the things that kept me going through the 2 sessions it took me to finish this movie on HBO Max was the anticipation of Hudson (one of the best Singer/Actors of the current generation) unleashing her pipes on ""Memory"". Alas, it was not to be.
Without insider knowledge, it's hard to know where one should lay the blame for such a travesty.
Producer?
Director?
Hudson herself?
Whoever decided it was a good idea to 'act' this song instead of singing it should be blacklisted from the film industry unto several generations. How can anyone make a musical without so much as a basic understanding of the power music wields?!
As a teenager when I first saw Cats at the National Theatre in D.C., I barely understood a bit of what was going on, but I understood that song even without knowing the words. Now, in my late 50s, just hearing the instrumental wind up to Memory can bring tears to my eyes. Imagine the anticipation of knowing that before this calamitous spectacle was over, there would be a chance to here Jennifer Hudson breath new life into this classic!Imagine the devastation of hearing her cry, wheeze, whisper, and sob through every line!Far be it from this reviewer to accuse an Academy Award winning actress of overacting, but the truth of the matter is that acting at all during the performance of this composition exceeds the boundaries of necessity and plunges headlong into the realm of crimes against art. Webber managed to capture every conceivable nuance of despair and heartbreak that might be associated with the character of Grizabella in the form of music and lyrics alone. By contrast, the movie Cats drowns the emotional impact of this song in a performance that evokes images of Carol Burnette doing a 5 minute death scene in one of her classic movie parodies.To sum up:
I find it extremely difficult to bestow a 1-star rating to a movie in which so many talented people obviously worked so hard. There have surely been many movies far worse than this one over the years.But, yeah, it was pretty bad.",Cats
1004,swklmpc,Oh for god's sake,8,1 January 2020,"To all the people who gave this film one star, might I remind you of Willy Wonka's line... ""Come with me and you'll be in a world of pure imagination!"" Hard to believe that so many people have lost their ability to imagine something beyond their narrow, dull lives. Perhaps because I saw the musical live on Broadway, I came in with no expectations except to see a filmed version of the musical. And make no mistake, that's what this is... a film of a musical with people pretending to be cats. The story line is very simple... the cats gather together one night of the year to compete to see who gets to be reborn into a new life. The lucky cat is chosen by old Deuteronomy and ascends to the ""Heaviside Layer."" End of story.All the people who said the trailer (and the film) were ""weird"" and ""creepy"" - you really need to get over yourselves. Sure, Tom Hooper could have just had the cast members dress in cat costumes. Instead he used CGI techniques to make them look more like cats. I never - for one second in the almost two hours of this film - thought the cats looked like anything more than people ""dressed up"" to look like cats. The CGI work was excellent. The set design, staging and choreography were all well done, as was most of the singing. Andrew Lloyd Webber doesn't write that many great songs, most are just passable. In this show, almost all of the songs are character driven and the set pieces were creatively imagined by Hooper and his crew.The only reason I didn't rate this a 9 or 10 is that I found some of the editing (especially in the dance sequences) was distracting. Oh, and I didn't like all the close-ups of Jennifer Hudson singing ""Memory"", although she did a very good job. (I still prefer Elaine Page's version.)So, to sum up... Imagination, people, Imagination! Or have you forgotten what that is?",Cats

The sets are mysteriously beautiful. But I think I was most impressed with the dancing choreographed by Andy Blankenbuehler and the dancers especially Francesca Hayward and Les Twins. But IMO all the Jellicle dancers put on an amazing show, so much so that there were moments in the film when I kind of wished director Tom Hooper had followed some of the full-cast dances a bit slower. But then again there is something to be said for Hooper's Infectious whirling effect. The singers are as good as the classic songs. Taylor Swift is a flirtatious Bombalurina who sings the nasty Macavity's (good job, Idris Elba) theme song as well as parts of ""Beautiful Ghosts"" & the full version over the end credits. . Jennifer Hudson's tortured, emotional version of ""Memory"" works wonderfully most of the time, especially at the end. This ""Cats"" casts Victoria in the starring role of an innocent homeless kitten rescued by some of the Jellicle tribe. I don't want to be a spoiler so I'll just say Victoria has some adventures as she gets to know individual Jellicles, some more than others. She follows one of Grizabella's ""Memory"" preludes with a sweet and touching version of ""Beautiful Ghosts"". If I try to comment on everyone and everything that makes Cats Cats this would be a very very long review! So just a few more. The comic relief provided by various cast members was uneven, some good, some ""meh"" but these short scenes do make Cats more entertaining and give audience members a chance to catch their collective breath. The most marvelous ""performances by an actor"" were Judi Dench as Old Deuteronomy and Ian McKellen as Gus the Theatre Cat. There is something so warm and inviting about Dame Judi's facial expressions; she was covered with just the right amount of digital fur so that the audience could be moved by them. Sir McKellen is a treasure.He plays an old, seen-it-all actor reminiscing about his long theatrical career with a sense of pride and joy in his craft that is genuinely moving.

The story is simple explaining the different types of cats as they perform in order to be chosen by Old Deuteronomy to be the cat who gets a new life. They all tell there story and the type of cat they are to win the new life. Sorry to see all the negative reviews which almost stopped me from going.

Some episodes were fabulous, some were just so-so. There's a lot of great dancing and some wonderful singing.The plot is minimalist, each song is just its own little character piece. And it feels like it's halfway between a streamed version of a broadway show and a full-fledged film adaptation -- some things are augmented, but it's still mostly a bunch of fixed sets. I liked it anyway.And the CGI wasn't that creepy -- except maybe the cockroaches -- the actors still looked like people in cat suits, just with more tail and ear motion. Even I -- never having seen the musical and knowing only about 8 bars of ""memories"" -- knew there would be people in cat suits.I don't know why I'm moved to write this review, I liked the film but didn't *love* it.

I have seen staged Cats and the filmed stage version is my go to movie for workouts dance routines, as with any Andrew Llyod Webber musical. I enjoyed every moment ignoring the creepy bits of cats in shoes and the miscasting of Jason Derillo as Rum Tum Tigger lead feet and heavy weighted movents and dragging voice. He cant sing or dance but even but, i am a crazy cat lady also (Rebel Wilson). I loved this musical! Judi Dench as Old Deuteronomy was beautiful. Ian mckellen as Gus the theater cat was clap worthy. They really brought their formal clasical acting talent. I clapped. Laurie Davidson as the magical mystical Mr. Mistoffelees just pulled me in and captured the audience support at his failed magical attempts. Jennefer Hudson plays a really good tragic figure as Grizabella. She did in Dream Girls and we all cried. Let's admit that although we don't want to. The girl is getting a Oscar this year. Idris Elba put his traditional theater talent to use and was the perfect Macativity. Even Taylor Swift was wonderful and people can go back to hating her afterwards but she showed her true talent. I chose to stop hating long enough to appreciate good talent. Rebel Wilson was surprising good cast and really captivated the audience with her roll as Jennyanydots.

The music is excellent, although it might be a bit wordy and non-catchy for some. The choreography is stunningly written and performed. It's the most perfect gaudy, self-absorbed, campy, ridiculous movie I've ever seen. It's just so unabashedly insane and sincere about being just that from start to finish.

1053,jeaglestwo,Not quite as atrocious as people say,4,18 February 2020,"The worst part of the film is when the actors/actresses cheer, instead of cheering, they meow. The meows made my ears bleed. It's horrible.
The VFX are god awful. The actors are uncanny valley human - cat hybrids. When they rub each other, scratch themselves etc, I felt incredibly uncomfortable. The ears and tails constantly twitching are incredibly distracting in 'emotional' moments of the film. The backgrounds and other scenery that's more than 6 feet from any actor descends into jpeg level quality, and most of the backgrounds look like they came from a PS2 game. I didn't know scenery and props could be uncanny valley but I have now seen otherwise.
If anybody asks me if I've tried LSD, I will simply reply that I have watched the Cats Movie
The backdrops are full of flashy neon billboards, all of which are terrible cat puns with the exception of proudly unaltered ""B O V R I L""
The few jokes that are there are mostly slapstick. Seeing tiny cgi mouse demons scream in fear and pain as they're thrown across the room did force a small smile out of me.
James Corden is James Corden.
One of James Corden's lines is ""This isn't going to work, is it?"" Which seems more like he was talking to the director.
Acting wasn't that bad and the plot was about as non existent as the original.As somebody who liked the original musical, the film added little to it besides uncanny valley and took away a lot of the charm. I'd advise people to instead look to the 1998 (I think) recording of the musical. The 2019 version is that but with wacky visuals and James Corden humour.",Cats

The ears and tails move with the mood of each character just like they would with a real cat.I honestly had no idea what to expect, and I was quite blown away.

1058,sixtrolls,Condemning the apple because it's not an orange,7,23 April 2020,"I literally joined IMDB because of the mass of bizarre judgements passed against this movie. Usually, the mass of opinions washes out the nonsense, but, somehow, everyone in the world has decided to permit the vacuum of criticism to suck them in; they seem to be falling over each other to parrot one another's invective. Seriously? Perhaps someone needs to restate the obvious. This movie is a special-effects adaptation of a novel and innovative Broadway show. It IS the Broadway show. Cats is a musical built out of the quirky feline fantasy of T. S. Elliot. Perhaps the real problem here is that this is, deliberately and pointedly, NOT a story about humans. The only human in the show is a reprehensible scumbag who makes a cameo appearance. Why should the fantasy world of cats be like the grubby, complicated world of humans? Why judge the broadway musical with a cinematic rule book?Many reviewers seem weirdly driven to find fault with the technical movie-making here: direction, cinematography and so forth. I'm sorry, but none of that was even close to the worst we've all seen -- and some of it was brilliant.Some reviewers complained that it was ""full of heavy-weight stars"" who were, somehow wasted and not given enough to really demonstrate ""their stuff."" Again, how silly is that? The greatest performers are invisible: all you see is their character. I saw famous actors trying desperately to be T.S. Elliot's cats -- not Willy Loman or King Lear -- and be otherwise invisible. For the most part, it was fun and funny, and it worked.I'll be the first to agree that the singing was a distraction, but the music and dancing was true to the show -- true to Webber's genius and what Broadway musicals are all about. The artistic settings and costuming, combined with the special effects, was nothing short of spectacular. So this wasn't a space war movie or ""The Terminator Meets Tom And Jerry."" It was a... I'll say it once more... a Broadway musical. It was every bit as entertaining as the actual stage musical -- and even more. To call it the worst movie you've ever seen is to admit that you need to get around a bit more and form some opinions of your own. I feel bad for y'all that you bungled an opportunity to let go and be entertained.",Cats

1065,x_agonystar_x,"Not completely, but mostly, terrible.",2,29 January 2020,"But close.Let me preface this by saying that after seeing the 1998 DVD of the stage play of ""Cats"", I was honestly angry that I had spent two hours of my life watching something I hated that much.So, it goes without saying that once I found out that my least favorite play was going to be a Major Motion Picture, I was slightly less than enthusiastic. I had less than no desire to see it. I would have rather spent two hours sitting on a cactus.However, I provide companionship and care for a woman with physical disabilities, and I knew a cat lover like her would want to see the movie. After she had a challenging few weeks, I thought taking her to ""Cats"" would be a nice diversion. For her, obviously...not so much me.The movie begins in a back alley in London, and some awful woman abandons a lovely...uh, cat...who struggles to make it out if a burlap sack and is surrounded by a group of terrifying humanoid cat people who begin to sing about how all cats have three names and how Jellicles can and Jellicles do. Whatever the fresh hell a Jellicle cat is, apparently anyone's guess.We discover Rebel Wilson as a fat, spoiled housecat (a Gumbie?) singing about mice and cockroaches, WHO THEN EATS COCKROACHES WITH HUMAN FACES AFTER THEIR ELABORATE DANCE NUMBER. *AND* she wriggles out of her ginger cat suit into a ridiculous chorus line outfit.What the hell, Tom Hooper.Now we are subjected to Jason Derulo as the Rum Tum Tugger, who does a whole number about what a contrarian he is while dancing and prancing around the milk bar. I am annoyed the milk bar has sweet flavored milk when cats can't even taste sweetness.WHAT THE HELL, TOM HOOPER.Idris Elba is thoroughly enjoying himself as the dastardly Macavity (as was I). Meanwhile, Jennifer Hudson, in the worst cat makeup ever, creeps around like a creepy creeper while the other cats act like assholes and make fun of her. As they do.James Corden gnaws on the scenery like a hungry beaver. Bustoffer Jones! The St James Street cat! He ends up on a boat with Rebel Wilson's Jennyanydots and Macavity's henchman, Growltiger.The mystery cat from the beginning mostly just watches everything with enormous kitten eyes.Mungojerrie and Rumpleteazer make a mess and then disappear, undoubtedly leaving some poor hapless dog to be blamed for their chaos.Ian McKellan is a much welcome sight as Gus, the Theatre Cat, but it's weird because he looks exactly like Ian McKellan in a bad cat suit with human hands.Old Deuteronomy is played by Judi Dench. Interesting choice. She gets to decide who goes to the Heaviside Layer. What's that? Cat heaven. Apparently. By this point in the movie, I wish I was in the Heaviside Layer, as it would be preferable than sitting through the rest of this movie.Taylor Swift, who I find annoying and insufferable in spite of her talent, chews more scenery and does a song about how glorious Macavity is. I close my eyes because I hope I can fall asleep to spare myself. No such luck.This film was like seeing something thrown in the trash that should be valuable, that a lot of talented people spent time creating, that should be worthwhile and treasured, but instead is just a piece of very expensive garbage.Remember the episode of The Simpsons where Homer creates a car with the help of his brother Herb? In this scenario, Tom Hooper is Herb and ""Cats"" is ""The Homer"".",Cats

These reviews are like listening to a herd of sheep bleating ""Baaddd, Baadddd, Bbaadd!"" There are virtually no original thoughts among them. Was Cats the best movie I've ever seen? Was it a major blockbuster? Is it going to be on my favorite movie list? The answers are all No but it still isn't the worst movie ever made.First, these are humans with human bodies and guess what? They are shaped like Humans not Cats! The CGI is not the worst ever done on the big screen. In fact, if you have a cat and actually look at their expressions and the way they look and react to situations then you'll realize that they did a fairly good job. The ears were particularly impressive.I didn't get a chance to see Cats on stage, something I truly hope happens again in the future, so I didn't know the story. I had no problem following the plot at all. That's one review point I couldn't understand at all. This wasn't a year in the life of the Cats of London it was a single evening, a very important and mysterious evening that allowed one of the Cats to have a new life. How is that so hard to follow? I believe that it honestly needed to be a bit longer to help it not feel rushed. I know that's exactly opposite to what everyone else has said but then again almost everything I am saying is opposite to the rest of the Review Sheep.The music was very nice. It wasn't as good as the Broadway Cast but it was good. I adored Dame Judy Dench. She was lovely as usual. Ian McKellen was wonderful. He was so scruffy and growley he looked like an old cat that has lived on the street his whole life. Also, what was wrong with ""cats"" lapping milk or water from saucers? Isn't that how cats drink? I have three and have had many others throughout my entire 53 years and honestly I have never seen any of them picking up a cup or glass to have a drink of milk.I thought James Corden was funny and cute as the Cat with the Spats. Idris Alba was wonderfully menacing, Jennifer Hudson was heartbreaking and Dame Judy was elderly and regal. I'm pretty sure this is how they were supposed to be appear. I'll be honest, I totally missed the fact that Taylor Swift was in the movie that is my fault I'm sure. I'm not a big fan of hers and I watched the movie without looking at the cast.So, people watch the movie with an open heart and just enjoy it as a movie and not a documentary.

The play has been successful for so many years and I don't understand why the feeling about the movie is so negative. One criticism was that the cats' appearance is strange because you can see the human interpreting the cat... Well, that was true about the play too, wasn't it?
The other criticism is that the story is weak. If so, that's also true about the play, right?
In my opinion, the musical part could be more interesting (Andrew LLoyd Weber has written more interesting songs), but I did enjoy very much the way the cats interacted among themselves (very similar to actual cats), I liked the way their ears moved (also very similar to actual cats), and I heard an interview where the director said he wanted them to maintain their human appearance so that we could identify with them.
All in all, I felt as if I was watching a play, and that was not a bad feeling at all.",Cats

1076,janroeland,Weird is not necessarily bad,6,23 December 2019,"Yes, it's weird, I completely agree. Although everything different is not necessarily bad. The CGI makes the actors look alien but kept their familiar faces. I must admit (am I the only one?) that it created a fascinating somewhat creepy attractiveness. The choreography is different from what you have seen before but it fits the cat theme perfectly. If all the critics would answer truthfully, they simply cannot say anything negative about the quality of the dancers. If you have seen the earlier musical version of Cats, you can see the nice parallels they draw. I would give it a 7 if it weren't for the very thin story line and the mediocre singing which almost made me leave after the first 45 minutes of the movie. So, I will eventually rate the movie with a 6. It was entertaining to see something familiar repacked in a weird setting that would fit well in an incoherent dream that I can only describe in this probably incoherent review.",Cats

The performances are great, the choreography is great, the sets and lighting are great, the CG human-cat hybrids are a nightmare.
The use of the original actors eyes, nose and mouth mixed with CG fur doesn't work. The fur can often be seen moving around the actors faces making it look like the face isn't attached to the body. I feel sorry for all the creatives involved because other than the CG this could have been a great film. It's hard to see the performances through the surreal nightmare.",Cats

The best moment in the film was when someone on a few rows in front of me started laughing really loud and saying ""whaaaaat"" before leaving.The great songs were blurred out by everything being super weird, and instead of spectacular dances that you expect in a musical it was just un-motivated and random theatrical dance moves. Yes, it probably wasn't totally random, but it didn't give me anything.Lets not talk about how all the cats look like tiny, hairy people and you are wondering the entire movie if they are supposed to be cats or humans, why some are naked and some not, why they have human feet (but two guys wear shoes), and if they were actually going to eat mice with kids faces.The movie missed the part about why people love musicals. If it had managed to be a great musical experience it should have been a pleasure to watch.

1085,lisa-lush,When is a Ginger not a Ginger,10,26 December 2019,".Dear Diary, Today I saw the movie ""Cats"". It has been destroyed mercilessly by the critics. Indeed so much so that I HAD to see it even more to see how badly Hollywood had destroyed one of my all time favourite musicals with its CGI realistic fur covered actors.
Contrary to popular belief they are real actors in this film. Real singing, real dancing and real situations and emotions...only the fur is fake. Its quite PC in that way if you like. They only touched up the bodies with Computer generated costuming. OK so the missed a few bits. Yes the version I saw today still had the human hands and Dame Judy Dench does have a lovely ring but why pan that as a movie fault. They have human faces, human eyes, lips, feet so what difference does a hand make? That is just nit picking in the extreme. I have no problem with it.
From the opening bars in the darkened theatre of almost 10 people... I cried. Tears rolled down my face with the beauty of those simple notes. I LOVE Cats the musical. It's on my ipod, its one of my 10 desert Island albums. I LOVED (almost) every part of this movie. I knew every song word for word. I knew the history of each cat and their personal pains and I love how each on was brought to life by the various actors portraying them today.
I had my doubts about Political correctness. Dame Judy as Old Deuteronomy, was originally a male role. But surprisingly it translated well. She was magnificent. Just one look in her eyes as she stares a Grisibella...and I was weeping again. I was pretty much crying at the beauty of this film for two hours. Even Rebel Wilson has a new respect from me. She played Jennyenydot to perfection. Although there was an additional sub plot in the film and she was an integral part of it, her quips, one liners and costumes changes were exactly right for her expanded role and personality.
If I have one major criticism its with Macavity the Mystery Cat played magnificently by Idris Elba and its simply that although beautifully rendered with a solid muscular body and the blackest fur with deep green eyes... the lyrics say quite clearly..
Macavity's a ginger cat,
he's very tall and thin
You would know him if you saw him
for his eyes are sunken inMacaviy here is simply NOT a black cat. Even in the movie they use the lyric ""Ginger Cat"" but show a fine but scary looking black cat. They really could have keep Idris in the role as he is perfect but CGI'ing ginger fur on the Avatar, Its not rocket science, However this is my only criticism.I loved this movie. I have already bought a ticket to see it again. I will own it n DVD when possible. I will turn up at midnight screenings in a onsie if necessary. Drag Queens are going to love the new song Taylor Swift added to the sound track ""Beautiful Ghosts"" It... just... works.The story is about learning about our cats and thus learning about ourselves. Its about magic and mischief and forgiveness. Its about beauty being more than fur deep. It makes you laugh and it makes you cry because you know what is coming and its wonderful. Ok, it has a sub plot but its more of a expansion of the characters and is entirely feasible script wise..See it... Take a new eyeliner and tissues. But see it..That means you",Cats

1098,CalebCarr,Every decision made was the wrong one.,1,22 December 2019,"I'm currently listening to the original sound track to try and cleanse myself of the 'film' I just saw. It was equal parts a bland tedious trudge to get through, and a confusing horrifically misjudged spectacle of disaster. The tone was all over the place. James Corden got some laughs almost purely from the way he seemed to be embarrassed to be in the picture. Jennifer Hudson's melodramatic hysterics were more cringe inducing than genuinely emotional. Sweeping epic songs are visualised in the most bland and ugly way possible.
I spent the whole film feeling frustrated at seeing a bunch of songs I like being butchered. Constantly interrupting the flow of a song to simply 'say' a line as opposed to 'singing' it isn't edgy, it's just worse.
The whole thing is so misguided that I'm sure even the on set catering was mucked up somehow.",Cats
1099,ryan-j,I Just Don't See Why Most People Hate It,9,2 January 2020,"To be clear, I am a big fan of musicals in general and know the stage version of Cats well enough to have been looking forward to this film when it was announced.When the trailer was released I didn't see the problem that everyone else did. The characters didn't look exactly like cats, but they never really did in the stage version either. It is this mindset that seems to have allowed me to enjoy the film while others have been unable to get passed how unlike cats the characters appear.Does it look real? No. But it didn't bother me. There are no other characters apart from a human silhouette to compare them to. Whereas the unrealistic elephant in the recent dumbo remake who was sharing the screen with human actors just stood out like a sore thumb.The songs are as good as they've ever been and the new song fit in well and is now on repeat in my brain. My fears the Rebel Wilson and James Corden would outstay their welcome and becoming annoying were unfounded and i ended up mostly enjoying their scenes.I assumed Jenifer Hudson's rendition of Memory would not be able to hit in the same way as Elaine Page but once again I have to admit I was wrong and that I did get teary eyed during the reprise.The only fault I noticed was the inconsistent scaling of the characters who at some times felt much smaller than real cats and then other times seeming much bigger.I've seen a lot of people call it boring and I have no idea why. Were they bored by the dancing scenes without songs? Did they not like the songs? I wasn't bored and at no point felt the film was dragging.Having heard the initial response to this film I was waiting for the moment when I suddenly saw why so many people seem to hate this film. That moment never came for me. I really enjoyed it and will happily watch it again.",Cats
1100,sharkbabyfilm,IN FULL DEFENSE OF CATS (2019),7,5 January 2020,"It's January 4th, and I just got out of a screening of Cats - and I'm not sure whether it's (#1) my fully lowered expectations based on an almost unanimous critical and audience panning of this movie, or (#2) because I saw the stage musical for the first time this year and personally was genuinely confused by the plot or what was happening - but I think it actually worked as a movie.Oh my gosh, he didn't hate it. #shocking, or something.Forever I have known Cats as the musical where people wear spandex and sing as cats on a stage, but really knew nothing more until this year. I remember watching the last season of Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt, and Cats is used as a hilarious plot point, and then I got a little more of a glimpse at the freak show behind the curtain - and what I gleaned from that was that the musical has gone past the weird, eccentric, artsy beginnings and has transcended past parody as being ""that weird cats musical with that 'Memory' song"", and now it is in that strange post-post modern period where it's just something that didn't need to be touched in any serious way, but now that it has been, it is in a new stage of parody - where people will fully brush it aside and laugh at the concept of it being made with their decision already made before entering the theatre, and may not want to recognize that it's actually pretty well done and accomplishes a faithful adaptation of the source material and visualizes it in a way that makes it more comprehensible and entertaining than the stage production.Hot take, I know.When I think about how the movie came to exist, I'm only working with hypotheticals - but it seems to me like the movie musical we deserve right now from Hollywood. It's a star-studded cast, with a Oscar-caliber director with a history of Oscar-winning musicals, with Oscar-winner Jennifer Hudson singing the classic song, with new technology applied to actors and cool set designs.... If this movie had come out 10-20 years ago, it would be nominated for everything, but now we think we're too cool for it - so now it's garbage.It's funny, because last year Green Book won as Best Picture, and a lot of the same elements apply to people's criticisms about that movie. It didn't feel like Best Picture of 2018, it felt like Best Picture of 1998. The only main differentiators were that the director was a comedy director gone drama, and the writer ended up, let's say, stretching the truth about the story. But structurally, Green Book works as a movie, and honestly, so does Cats.Cats hate really feels like where we are in society right now - we're just really divisive and have made up our minds without ever really giving it a chance. It's like Cats is what a democrat thinks of when he turns on Fox News, and vice versa if you're a republican. We can't see past the poster, because we don't want to. Cats is it's own special kind of freak show, and we're in the mindset to reject the freak right now. Any real message of seeing the true side of someone's character in the Cats narrative is discounted, because we've all got a little bit of a fighting, close-minded bully in us right now.Now, in terms of adaptations - I feel like there is more to be said for what works in Cats.I remember leaving the stage production of Cats, and my review was ""Oh, so it basically was a bunch of Cats singing introductory songs about each other"" - and this movie takes that a step further and gives you the source material in a way that diversifies the visuals, expands the world into different environments, and makes the villain and general plot line comprehensible in a way that didn't initially strike me during the stage production.The source material isn't really conducive to a movie plot, because each song is a different cat, and it probably would work better as some kind of short-form multi-episode web-series than a movie if you really step back and think about it - but as a feature adaptation of the musical - it does the absolute best it could do in translating the magic of Cats to the big screen.All of the cats and the celebs playing them give personality to their characters, and you do get a sense of their celebrity enhancing the personality - whether it's James Corden or Rebel Wilson, or even a British-accented Jason Derulo. The plot is linear with a clear antagonist and a ticking clock set for a climax at the end of the evening - so in terms of watchability, it's not confusing narratively. The only thing to do to clarify the plot would be to put some kind of Star Wars type scroll at the beginning defining what a Jellicle cat is - because it's such an important part that can be alienating to someone who has never heard or seen anything about the musical.The effects were fine - I'm not sure if I saw the updated version or not, but I definitely did still see Judi Dench's wedding ring, but they weren't distracting. They felt like part of the style, and it was like they were animated cat people - which is the actual, obvious point. Did I feel like I was watching cats? No. Was I supposed to have the same feeling as the first time I saw Gollum in Lord Of The Rings: The Two Towers? Absolutely not. We live in a world of CGI enhancements, and there's plenty of examples of imperfect effects in all movies - from the most mainstream Marvel movie to the Gemini Man ""groundbreaking"" character work. If something is rushed or didn't have the money behind it - it can look off. But nothing in Cats looked like The Rock in The Mummy Returns, and we can stop saying that it looks awful - because it doesn't.At the end of the day, it feels like Andrew Lloyd Weber was taking the right kind of drugs to find a human message to his Cats musical, and since 1981, the drugs have worn off. Now, we just replaced them with opioids, and we're addicted to something new - which is a brand of close-minded narcissism - because honestly, they made a movie about singing and dancing cats, and that's what you got.And Tom Hooper did a good job, because at the end of the day, he learned from his mistake of putting Russell Crowe in Les Miserables and didn't put someone who absolutely couldn't sing at all in this movie - and that deserves respect.",Cats

And one of the guys is a ballet dancer and tap dancer in London. I commend them for their talent especially his tap dancing skills. You could tell he had been tap dancing from a very early age. WOW!

The way the cats moved varied throughout the film (walking on two feet or four feet) and I noticed a few errors in the sizes of the cats compared to their props & scenery.All of the sung parts seemed to be recorded 'dry', without any acoustics appropriate to the setting of the scene, which really spoiled the realism for me.

I thought the movie was quite entertaining and a fun watch for the whole family. My 5 year old nephew suddenly got out of his seat and started dancing when Rum Tum Tugger was doing his thing. The kids got a good laugh out of the silly antics of Jennyanydots played by Rebel Wilson, who was essentially playing herself in all her other movies. Don't get me wrong, I LOVE Rebel Wilson, Inthink she's hilarious! Absolutely loved Ian McKellan's performance as Gus and his presentation piece to contend for the Jellicle Choice. CG was able to gift this movie with realistic feline twitches and movements for the actors.I've seen some reviews claiming there is no plot. It's quite simple, you got a bunch of cats who are contending to be selected as the chosen Jellicle to be whisked away to a new life in Heaviside Layer. Where's Heaviside Layer? Who knows? It's just some place a bunch of cats made up. Ultimately this is a movie about - well Cats! And the mystical , magical lives they lead.",Cats

1128,scanlon11,So nicely done. So misunderstood.,9,18 January 2020,"For anyone who takes the time to research the original book of poetry and the Broadway production of this title, they will find a fine film adaptation of an art piece that most film goers will never understand. No, there is no high action. No, there is no sexual innuendo, no, there is no Hollywood tagline or payoff. Instead, its a poetic, dance-filled adaptation that pays homage to its origins, with a nice touch of film story-telling to fill the large screen. If I had a fine piece of art in my house, I would enjoy it privately, knowing that most people might just not see the beauty of its value. My wife and I enjoyed every minute of this film and were grateful for the artists who took the time to do it right, adding just enough film fanfare to bring it up to date. And if the common film-going audience doesn't get it, that leaves more for those of us who appreciate a wonderful theatrical moment. Bravo!",Cats
1129,scanlon11,Not surprised by audience reactions.,9,18 January 2020,"Film has trained us to beg for high action, cheap thrills and as much skin as possible. This film chose not to fall into the Hollywood model, thank goodness, and play honestly to the original materials it borrowed from. The result was a highly theatrical piece with incredible voices and dance numbers that just brushed the popularity of its Broadway version. Rich with visual skills that only a film could add, the artistic payoff was well-made. I am glad there are still film-makers who don't feel the Hollywood formula is the only type of entertainment the paying audience wishes to see. I am sorry the vast majority just do get this film, but with what they've been feeding on for most of their lives, it's really not a surprise.",Cats

It seems that the reviews only help you to acknowledge that you are a little masochistic.

If you don't you'll find your attention drawn to other details like settings (on average good rather than great) and effects (divisive). Film is not a total success but has enough to warrant a viewing. An enjoyable musical, showcasing really skilled dancers and some good enough singing. A handful of standout set pieces.

Then I saw the trailer and like everyone else my dreams were crushed. Next the reviews rolled in for the movie by critics and viewers and 2.6 out of 10 stars speaks for itself. I prepared for the absolute worst.And here's the thing...did it miss the mark by a landslide? Absolutely. Are there a million ways it failed to fulfill an iota of it's maximum potential? 100%. But when all is said and done, I sat in that theater with the right crew of people who were willing to go along with the ride, and...I really REALLY enjoyed it! I just took it for what it was and was able to forgive the shortcomings in favor of experiencing the magic of a new envisioning of characters whom i have loved for decades!So my advice: if you love the musical and can muster a whimsical ""to heck with expectations"" attitude, see this music on the big screen and just enjoy the ride! It really did leave so much to be desired...but to heck with that! I enjoyed it anyway!",Cats

Francesca Hayward. You can tell she is a professional dancer and actress. She was amazing. She deserves a better film to be in. She hypnotized us all with her elegant talent.

1154,downundathunda93,"Good nostalgia hit, mediocre execution.",6,27 April 2020,"As someone who was a fan of the stage show since I was a kid, I found this movie to be a great nostalgia hit. I found myself singing along to most of the songs, and was pleasantly surprised at the new ones. I particularly liked Victoria's new solo, ""Beautiful Ghosts"". I found it touching and beautifully sung by Francesca Hayward, her sweet voice wonderfully and emotionally telling Victoria's story.My only real complaint with how the film was cast, was the choice to make Old Deuteronomy a female. I think that Judi Dench played the role perfectly, and she was absolutely the perfect choice for a female Deuteronomy, but it was a little jarring, having been used to the original stage version, where he was a male. On speaking about Dame Judi Dench, I was pleasantly surprised with both her performance, as well as Sir Ian McKellan's. Neither of them would likely ever have been my personal first choice for a musical role, but they did well in thier respective roles.Now, for the big problem.. The CG. I'm only going to touch lightly on this, as everybody has been complaining about it ever since the first trailer came out for Cats. I think that I'll just leave it at, they relied far too heavily on CG, when practical effects could have just as easily done a lot of what they did with computers. The stage show never needed computers to make the actors look like cats, and even if they just had the same costumes from the stage show, it would have looked much better. There were a few scenes where computer effects were needed, for instance, the times when Macavity made other cats or himself vanish, or the trasition to the rail yard for Skimbleshanks' song, but the costumes, I'm 100% siding with, they should have been physical costumes.In summery, as I watched this movie, I was fully expecting to dislike it, and thought that James Cordon and Rebel Wilson would carry the film with some comedy, which they absolutely added, but it wasn't the only thing keeping me watching. This film pleasantly surprised me, and I wouldn't object to seeing it again.",Cats

The acting was spot on, Judi Denchi was cast perfectly as was Ian McKellen and there was no pretence at being politically correct unlike a lot of other movies out at the moment, a classic case of the right person for the job.

2 - That the Incredibly Famous ICONIC Musical Number ""Memories"" was from That Broadway Musical Production.
3 - (Lastly) Had Heard that Many Parents would Not Allow their Kids to See 'THIS' Particular Broadway Musical Production!! (Never Knew Why Though!!)
(Still Don't Know Why!!)So Naturally, This was DEFINITELY on my Bucket List to Watch (i.e..The Musical!!) So Lemme tell you How Overjoyed I was to Learn, that there was a Musical Film based on the Incredible Broadway Musical Production being made!!!I watched it just Yesterday (here in Canada), and from the First few minutes, I was HOOKED!!!! From the Infectious Main Score of the Opening Number, to us, the audience, seeing all the characters introduce themselves in their own unique way, to the Attention Grabbing Songs and Wonderfully Choreographed Routines.
The Other Cast Members Performances were Wonderful, But Jennifer Hudson's Performance Forcefully REMINDS us..""WHY"" She's Won an Oscar, Grammy, Bafta & SAG Award!!! Her Performance was Extremely Captivating, Mesmerizing and Heart-Felt!! Overall EXQUISITE!!! Andrew Lloyd Webber is a Mad Genius when it comes to Song-Writing & Storytelling!!!I Still Don't Understand 2 Things... 1 - Why Parents Don't Allow their Children to see This Play with them and 2 - How on EARTH does this Amazing Musical Film Only Have a Rating of 2??????

1160,Tckelley74,Spectacularly bad,2,16 January 2020,"There is no other movie I have seen in the last decade that achieves the level of greatness as a bad movie as does Cats (though Jack and Jill is not that far behind followed perhaps by Jupiter Ascending). What makes Cats so impressively bad is that it is clear that it was produced with tremendous effort and sincerity and hopelessly wastes the talents of so many talented people. I would love to say that it becomes a guilty pleasure and is an enjoyably bad film up there with Flash Gordon and Night of the Lepus but the disturbing humanization of the cat characters goes way off-kilter and results in something that is more like fetish porn than being a tribute to the wonderful stage play Cats was back in the 80s. I have seen it on stage and loved it-frankly, I really wanted to love Cats the movie. But I hated it and burst out laughing several times at the absurdities I was watching (for example the scene on the railroad tracks where some sort of Freddie Mercury cat had a dance and song...WTF?). Idris Elba, please do another season/series of Luther. Judi Dench, Ian McKellen,
please do anything else...maybe a remake of Plan 9 from Outer Space. I cannot unsee it! The Razzies should be fun this year! I suspect a sweep may take place...like with Jack and Jill.",Cats

1162,alexjf1994-12-270064,People have made up their minds before watching this film,8,24 December 2019,"I was always optimistic about watching Cats and, despite the horrendous debut of the trailer and the months of hatred people poured in to the film without seeing it, I am very glad that I took the time to watch it.
As a fan of the stage production, the plot (which some ignorant people seem to think is non-existent?) was already apparent to me which I honestly do believe is a big factor of why I enjoyed the film as much as I did. It seems that a lot of people are going in to this film without knowing anything about it which, of course, is going to mean that they will have trouble getting to grips with what is put in front of them. However, the film does well to portray the story to anyone willing to take it in, which I presume a lot of audiences haven't been prepared to do which is a huge shame. The casting, albeit including the ever-underwhelming James Corden, were fantastic; Dame Judi Dench was phenomenal, Sir Ian McKellen played Gus superbly and what a turn for Francesca Hayward who was simply stunning as Victoria, leading us, through the evening of wonder with the Jellicle cats. Victoria is supposed to represent us, the viewer, just as this strange and wonderful world is completely new to us, it is also completely ew to her and I really just wish that people were more open to embracing this world than being so abrasive instead.
I watched this film with two friends who had no idea about what they were about to watch. At the start, they seemed to be put off and were making little jokes about how ""bad"" the CGI was and how they didn't know what was happening but then they allowed themselves to get lost in to the film and ultimately enjoyed it. Something that I believe everyone could do, if they really give this film a chance.
Cats will become a cult-classic that will go down in history, not as the worst musical ever made, but as the most misunderstood film ever made.
Please don't let the negative reviews taint your viewing of this film. Don't let the over critical critics, the same ones that told us that Ad Astra and Crawl were some of the best films of 2019, dictate to you what is a ""bad film"".

I had never seen any other Cats production before so maybe that's one reason why I was able to watch it without comparing it to some other production. I thought the beauty of using a cast of true actors was genius because the emotions were important to the story and it's important to get good actors who can properly convey those emotions to the audience. Jennifer Hudson, Judi Dench, the actor who plays Mr. Mistofelees, to name just a few, these actors truly convey not only the emotions needed to tell their stories but also really got into the minds of cats and convey through their movements the quirky attitudes of cats. And I thought it was brilliant to let Rebel Wilson and James Corden be funny. It was great! I loved this movie. Most movies I can't watch more than once, but this one I see myself watching it several times, at least. I also thought the costumes and cgi to enhance them with catlike movements were brilliant.

The performances, especially not the ""big"" names are really good-smart move to cast actual dancers. Jennifer Hudson nails Memory. James Corden and Rebel Wilson provide welcome comic relief. Jason DeRulo can sing and dance. Wasn't thrilled with the look of Iris Elba as Macavity- he seemed too thin and the eyes were distracting. The dance sequences are well done and if anything, the movie emphasizes an actual storyline. My criticism lies with the direction and the CGI- they don't look like cats.

Once you see past the strangeness (this took me about the overture to do - stop being over-dramatic) you see what this film actually is: a fantastic musical brought on to screen by some household names and some incredibly talented stage actors/singers/dancers, most of whom will be relatively unknown to the wider public.I came out with most of the songs in my head ('Beautiful Ghosts' is a terrific addition), despite reading multiple bad reviews before watching this.

I just really enjoyed it! It's so bad! The CGI is terrifying! There are other creepy animals in it too. There is snot coming out of Jennifer Hudson's nose the whole time she's singing! Rebel Wilson is rolling around on the ground. Judy Dench looks evil, and has a monologue that never ends. It's over all one gigantic mess. And there is really weird dances involving the cats tails! The movie is just so cringeworthy.But with it all put together it's AMAZING! I couldn't stop watching. It's entertaining! And when I say it's the second coming of Rocky, I mean I could see it being a cult classic.

It was a dreadful cacophony of rubbish dancing, creepy CGI and terrible music for two hours straight. The film didn't seem to have any plot, and seemed inappropriately suggestive for a U rated film.I will personally never forget watching an unfunny Rebel Wilson eating cockroaches and making tired jokes about her weight.The film has hardly any lines, it's just boring song after boring song.

The music is so beautiful, the sets are magnificent, and the CGI (or costumes) are perfectly fine. They help you understand the characters as cats. It's so fascinating to learn about all the different ones- and much of it is quite funny. What it is more than anything, though, is a heartbreaking fantasy about what it might be like to be a real cat! If you love musicals there is a great chance you will love this one, too. Don't let anyone discourage you from seeing it. See for yourself how beautiful it is.

I wonder if they just tried too hard with the special effects like the twitching tails, whether Deuteronomy being female instead of male upset the die hards. I thought the ballet skills of the new abandoned cat were beautiful and thought Grizabella was fantastic. Such a shame this musical got so poorly scored. Cats was always going to be love it or hate it even in the theater. For me mostly it ticked my boxes but did not like the twitching tails. Not the sort of musical I want to see computer generated special effects. I would watch it again as I love musicals but I can understand to some extent why this did not score greatly.

I was afraid I would be a strong critic, comparing it with the original stage production which I fell in love with after seeing it in London many years ago. BUT I was in as much bliss at the movie as I was at the stage musical! So fun!! It was hard to keep from singing!!I at first found it odd that Old Deuteronomy would be cast as a female this time, but Judy Dench was PERFECT in the roll! My only critique is that I did not like making one of the Jellicle Cats be an evil character....that was a new spin not seen in the stage production. Mischievous cats, yes.....but not evil in the sense that McCavity was portrayed here. Could have done without that sequence.However, in all, it was top notch. Such work went into this....the movements of the cast to be cat-like, all the dancing. Why this was snubbed for an Oscar nomination is beyond me. Everyone behind this production deserves more than what the critics and many viewers gave them. All of my friends who have seen it seemed to love it as much as me!!I will say that not only is this likely to be my favorite movie for the rest of 2020 (I saw it in Jan. 2020) but it just may be my favorite movie of all time.

The songs and dances are well performed. It's a shame, because I feel terrible for the cast. It's not their fault. I don't think they knew what visual effects were going to be applied with CGI in post.This film is unintentionally one of the greatest horror movies ever made, worthy of recognition alongside The Exorcist. You are that uncomfortable as you sit through it.Whoever gave the final go-ahead to make the cats look the way they look does not know what cats or people look like. The characters do not look quite feline enough and do not look quite human enough. They fall into a gray area somewhere in between and we call this ""the uncanny valley."" This movie is more horrifying than ""It: Chapter 1"" if you are a coulrophobe.I would rather it were ""Spiders."" You would at least know what you're getting into then and I cannot stand spiders.The most nightmarish moments are after certain songs when the cats start meowing or lapping milk and water out of bowls. I felt like the Nazis at the end of ""Raiders of the Lost Ark."" I thought my face was going to melt off.My friends and I went to it after laughing at all the bad reviews because we wanted to make fun of it, but it's so visually horrid that it held us tight in its Uncanny Valley grip for the whole of its two hours. Who in the production department looked at the finished computer generation of the cats' appearances and said, ""That looks good. Let's go with that!""?If you go, DO NOT TAKE YOUR CHILDREN.

1202,tjveil,"Yes, this is one of those films that's way better than the reviews",8,4 April 2021,"Prior to seeing ""Cats"" on HBO the other day, all I knew about it was that it was a successful stage musical, but got savaged as a movie. That never made sense to me.It still doesn't. ""Cats"" is a lively, endearing, sung presentation of T. S. Eliot's poems explaining the different personalities of cats and why they do what they do. There's a through plot about the group of cats known as Jellicles gathering together to see which one will be chosen for rebirth. You'll meet characters like Asparagus (aka Gus), a theatrical cat past his prime; Mr. Mestoffelees, a magical cat; Macavity, a devious cat who's meant as a clear analog to Professor Moriarty; Victoria, the cat who gets taken in when she's dumped by her owner; and of course Old Deuteronomy, the venerable cat who has final say on who goes to their heavenly reward and comes back.Andrew Lloyd Webber's songs are as good as you'd expect, particularly the upbeat ""Mr. Mestophelees"", Jennifer Hudson's ""Memories"", and a funny, jazzy show stopper piece about the nefarious Macavity.Two of the actors in particular should be praised. Francesca Hayward as Victoria delivers a beautiful, sensitive performance as our eyes into the cat world. And Dame Judi Dench...is there nothing she can't play? She doesn't get to do much for the bulk of the film, but makes up for it with a touching, big-hearted turn as wise Old Deuteronomy. The two of them at the end of the film are wonderful together.Now, if you need to be convinced that so many of the bad reviews are just trolling, consider how many of them are rated 1. There is way too much good music, talent and beauty in this movie to rank it that low--especially when it's in many ways identical to the hit play from which it derives.Some of the complaints I've seen (on YouTube and other places) are just ridiculous. With the possible exception of the opening scene where Victoria is dropped off on the street, the CG is fine. It's not supposed to be photorealistic, any more than the actors are supposed to spend the entire movie walking on all fours. The makeup work is far better than anything you'll see on the stage. And the silliest complaint of all? ""Cats with breasts? LOL."" Oh, give me a break. Like the stage version was performed by an all-male cast or something.Give it a shot and see if you're not entertained. After it's over the song ""Macavity"" will be stuck in your head.",Cats

It's supposed to be a retelling and reimagining of one of Sir Andrew Lloyd Webber's most famous theatrical masterpieces, which is only second to The Phantom Of The Opera. Personally, I think Tom Hooper did a splendid and fantastic job directing this Broadway-inspired stage play. Yeah, the plot was somewhat bland and distasteful, and lacking punch or finesse. But overall the delivery and performances were outright impressive and phenomenal, and it's all thanks to the star-studded casts with their vocal prowess and creative interpretations. Certainly worth mentioning are Jennifer Hudson ('Dreamgirls') and Rebel Wilson ('Pitch Perfect') - arguably two of the strongest female leads in this extravagant production, who shined and stood out from the rest for their outrageous and precocious singing. So kudos and congrats to all the actors, and thank you Tom for this weird and wonderful blockbuster as well as an artsy piece of entertainment flick we all would simply love to hate...PEACE! ;)",Cats

1212,raysjazz,"ART IS IN THE EYES, EARS & INTELLIGENCE OF THE AUDIENCE.",8,16 January 2020,"Yesterday went to see CATS - the movie that seems to be disparaged by Hollywood elitists and many in the general public.So upfront let me say that I have loved the book ""Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats' by T. S. Eliot and was thrilled when I saw the stage production with the brilliant score by Andrew Lloyd Webber. Those 2 sources are the basis for my evaluation of this work - ART. It is (opinion of one) ART in its truest form.I've seen many stage productions -Broadway's Winter Garden, Hollywood's Kodak Theatre and several other productions including London Theatre -West End in London.At each production I've overheard audience members comments as they leave. Those who understand the ART of the work loved the show. Many others who weren't familiar with the sources either were puzzled or hated it. So I wasn't surprised as I read some the the early reviews.For the most part the movie did NOT disappoint. The score remains brilliant and many of the performers brought inspired interpretations of their characters.The most disappointing performance was by Rebel Wilson who portrayed the normal Matronly character of Jennyanydots as a sloven seductress who munches on the tattoo of dancing beetles.Also disappointed that the characters Mungojerrie and Rumpleteazer chose to re-interpret the original music for their characters - poorly done.Outstanding performances were Jennifer Hudson - Grizabella, Judy Dench - Old Deuteronomy, Taylor Swift -Bombalurina, Francesca Hayward -Victoria and Steven McRae -Skimbleshanks. Both Francesca & Steven were brilliant in their respective dance interpretations.Bottomline - if you don't know the T.S. Eliot book or the Weber score, you'll enjoy the show better if you read the book and listen to the score. If you hated the stage production, you probably despise the movie. BUT - - - If you love the show, the book and the score - I believe you'll enjoy the majority of this wonderful cinematic version.",Cats

1215,kirstypassfieldhinchcliffe,Cats just isn't a great story,4,23 December 2019,"I was hoping for so much from the trailer as it appeared the music had been updated from the very obvious classic sound that goes with so
many of Lloyd Webber's musicals (Starlight Express) but it hasn't. I came away from the film thinking the same that I did when I saw the musical in the west end for the second time when Nicole PCDs was in it. My thoughts are that the story of Cats is just not that good it was very dry, boring at the start and didn't really get going until they start to audition for the new life. Memory always makes this story because it's a good song and people know that song and a couple others that are good.
What I liked about it was Ian Mckellen, having seen his one man show it makes totals sense that he is Gus the Theatre cat he fit the part and it was like him playing his life in that part. The colours of the background were good, the songs were good for Skimbleshanks the Railway cat and the story that went with it. The storytelling in the film was a lot better I actually understood the plot of the story this time round. I did like Idris Elba as Macavity he brought real seedy and thuggishness to the part, i always knew this cat was bad but it comes to life a bit more in this and you get his story more.
What I didn't like was some parts were definitely unnecessary, I think they are in the stage show but James Corden and Rebel Wilson were wasted and did not make those parts any better, Jason Derulo, Ray Winstone and Taylor Swift weren't needed either. Also sometimes the songs took a while to get to the real good notes, they didn't seem to take off as well as they do onstage, for example Magical Mr Mistofeles is such a good song really fun but the anxious portrayal almost prevented the song from being good. Memory did hit the note and Jennifer Hudson was a good choice but I was very concerned it was going to be good as it kept being interrupted by another character and your like just let her sing and hit the notes which she did but right up until that note your a bit frustrated - well I was but I love Elaine Page's version a lot.
This had such promise as there is a great cast I do think the songs are good in Cats but the story of Cats for me isn't enjoyable and I don't think anything could make that good for me, it needs more excitement at the start for me.
What is good is bringing a West End stage show to the screen, musicals are so expensive to see meaning lots of people miss out and I think it's important for people to have the opportunity to see this type of show.",Cats

The acting was sublime and Andrew Lloyd Webber gave a great performance as Meowski. The cat sex scene did feel a bit out of place in the film but it was necessary for the plot and (as me and my mother agree) very kinky! (I splooged) Ian McKellen was arguably one of the characters of the movie and as was Idris Elbow. Would give 10 stars if allowed.

1243,odettecralph-66283,Terrible direction!,3,30 December 2019,"So, the new Cats the musical film. 🤔 Trying hard to put my thoughts into coherent words.
I went in with an open mind as I promised. Jennifer Hudson was actually good as Grizabella if not a bit too melodramatic, really enjoyed Taylor Swift's sassy rendition of Macavity as Bombalurina. Victoria the new white cat was a beautiful dancer as expected from a principal at the Royal Ballet but most of the ensemble dance numbers were disappointing, and Skimbleshanks the railway cat was a fun tap number.
But... I felt there were some bad directing decisions. The first few numbers weren't strong at all, my eldest daughter said it sounded like a mediocre school play. Kind of agree, my daughters' dance school competition troupes sound much stronger in my humble opinion.
And as much as I love Rebel Wilson, she's a great comedy actress; why change Jennyanydots/Gumby Cat to be a solo unless you have an incredibly strong vocalist to sing it? Sounded much better as a group number.
And finally, I was very excited at the casting of Jason Derullo as RumTumTugger, he has the talent and personality to really bring that naughty tomcat to life. But it came across slightly bland. 😕 He hit the high notes, but lost so much of the sass and swagger from the original.
Has to listen to the original soundtrack on the way home just to feel better. 😕",Cats

It's like Blade Runner meets The Muppets,1,31 December 2019,"When you give a karaoke competition third runner up an Oscar for effectively playing herself, you're asking for trouble. And though it's taken many years, that festering sore has finally burst through the skin with Jennifer Hudson's rendition of Memory in this shockingly unpleasant movie version of a shockingly unpleasant stage show.To be fair to the makers of this abomination, the source material they had to work with is the real problem here - a painfully stupid and tuneless musical based on a collection of poems about cats, the writer of which could never in his wildest dreams have imagined someone would make into a stage play. Why would they? The answer is the key to everything that's wrong with this movie : over inflated ego.It is gargantuan ego that put Taylor Swift, Idris Elba, James Corden, and others to sign up to this and not demand to be edited out after seeing the final depressing version. It is ego that makes Rebel Wilson think she can be the same character she is in everything else she's ever done and she will be funny (spoiler: she isn't). But even these graphic demonstrations of colossal self delusion pale in comparison to Hudson's hilarious performance.To be by far the worst thing about the worst movie possibly ever made is in itself notable, but to quite obviously think you're by far the best thing in a profoundly important masterpiece is ego that mere mortals like you and I can only ponder on. Hudson viciously and sadistically tortures every note of Memory the way anyone with a musical bone in their body has always wanted to torture Andrew Lloyd Webber. It is the only laugh out loud moment of the whole show, and believe me, I was not the only one in the cinema laughing.What is interesting about all this though is that it makes us take a look at ourselves. We sometimes like to think of actors we've liked in various things as good folk who we'd enjoy having over to dinner, even though we've never met them. But what this movie shows is that our beloved thespians are in fact scrabbling back biters who would do anything for a feed yet think themselves superior to us and each other (and yet they all had so much trouble pretending to be cats...).And that's the sad part. Taylor Swift, James Corden, Jennifer Hudson, we already knew about. But Idris Elba, Ian McKellen, Judy Dench - we see you now. And we won't forget. And nor, Ray Winstone, will the owners of Bet365.

Jennifer Hudson's rendition of Memory was the only thing I enjoyed, but damn, I would have rathered just download the song.

I watched this because I like musicals, and it has some good music in it.I wanted to be neutral going in, and I kind of was - until Rebel Wilson did her thing and just made me cringe... then Corden, who I like, made me cringe, maybe even more (and RW was a tough cringe-act to follow!) I truly think that acting-wise, there wasn't really a non-cringeworthy thing about this movie. But let's be honest, people who like the musical - it's ALWAYS been that way. It's always been complete nonsense, a silly induced 80s nightmare. I still to this day don't know why the musical was so popular. So, we can't blame all the cringe on Hooper.A few redeeming factors in this. The choreography was pretty good at parts, even if not quite on par with the stage show. I was impressed with Steven McRae's tap-dancing. As a professional musician, I'm inclined to say the singing was maybe a B- at some parts, and middling to mediocre in others.

People need to realise this movie is based on a musical that in turn is based on a book of poems about cats. Books of poems don't have storylines, they have concepts. When creating the musical TS Elliott's widow required ALWebber to stay true to the work. No freestyling allowed. So that's why there is minimal plot-line in both the musical and this movie.It's all singing and dancing!
That's because it's a musical people! Surely you knew this going in.It's boring!
Yes, but the boring songs are the exact same ones as in the musical. No surprises there. You were never going to like every song.The CGI's creepy!
Yes in parts it looks like when people photoshop their family's heads on Elves in those Christmas dancing videos. But not all the time.The cats have hands! That's cos they're actors. The cats walk around on two feet too. Who cares.All this just does not add up to a 1/10, even with with the addition of Rebel Wilson's most annoying character/awful song. Jennifer Hudson is superb and commanding as always; the newbie playing Victoria was beautiful both with her stunning ballet moves and her delicate soft voice singing Ms Swift's new song; Judy Dench was fabulous and stately as Old Deuteronomy. Blow me down even Jason Derulo had some charisma too!Yes, the singing seemed a bit amateur at times but the orchestration and dancing in scenes like the Jellicle ball balanced this out.I feel people just love to hate musicals and ALWebber. It always amuses me greatly how people publicly hate musicals but Cats ran for like 16 years and Phantom of the Opera (arguably ALWebber's most famous musical) is still going on Broadway after 30 years. Someone must be liking them and be going along!!!!This movie unfortunately will end up suffering the same fate, with the low scoring reviews perpetuating this anomaly.

1268,jessmasterton,Great take on reimagining a popular stage show,8,28 December 2019,"I think this film is a classic example of expectations being too high. It was never going to be a word for word step for step remake of the stage show and why should it be. Whilst Lloyd Webber created an amazing show it would be stupid to replicate it. Whilst the stage show has only singing, this movie goes deeper into creating a story so the dialogue is very helpful to helping the story along.Use your imagination and some of the fantastic imagery and within it is actual a diamond in the rough.The choreography is not as sharp as the 1998 production however when watching it you have to remember that they are trying to replicate feline movement - something which they actually do quite well!I adore the stage musical and think the music within it is fantastic. The cast do a wonderful job of carrying the story and bringing more attention to Victoria and WHY the cats are doing what they are doing that the stage musical does. They have given the cats more personality which is deeply needed.The only weakness in the cast is Taylor Swift who sadly doesn't seem to realise she should be moving like a cat not as a pop star -That being said Judi Dench is a fantastic Old Deuteronomy and Ian McKellen is an adorable Gus!!Overall it isn't to everyone's taste but as a firm fan of the stage musical I very much approve of the vision of this film. Some parts of it don't fit and don't look as sharp as they could but if you go in with no expectations and let your imagination guide you I guarantee you'll enjoy it far more than trying to compare it or make it something it just isn't.",Cats

1285,MarcIdaho,Seriously? Can We Stop Hating?,6,4 April 2020,"I created an account to review this unwise, but not horrible adaptation of the stage musical CATS. Keep reading.My review is a bit different Than the thousands of 1 ratings you've enjoyed reading. I have a degree in theater and I taught and staged plays and musicals for over 25 years. Some musicals do not transfer well to film. On stage this takes place in a junkyard. That's it. When they did the film of Godspell, they didn't keep it in a fenced in garbage-filled lot. Why not expand the location where the film takes place. I want to examine the most common complaints and explain why you shouldn't hate so much. .1.It was boring, didn't tell a good story, it was just a bunch of Cats introducing themselves.
Ummmmm...that is the plot of Cats. If you've never seen the show, you'd probably hate that, too. If anything, they added a few minutes of dialogue to make the little plot from the show make more sense to those who had never seen it. The addition of extra conflict with Macavity made more interest than less. I also loved the addition of the White Cat who took the place of the audience in that the cats all introduced themselves to her and made these introductions make even more sense. So if you didn't like the plot, Blame T.S.Elliot and Andrew Lloyd Weber. Be thankful they cut the war between the cats and dogs. I don't even listen to that when the Broadway Version is playing.2. The CGI sucked. Get over it. I enjoyed the different sets and the film was still 95% singing and dancing. Most of what was done was to meet the requirements of a movie musical: make a version of the stage musical that is more suited to film (close-ups, various settings, acceptable to adults and children who don't live on the coasts where theater is not an industry). Film is an art that does not always have the same attributes as the stage. I don't watch films specifically for where there are errors. One of the best parts of the first Star Wars movie, Episode IV, is in the opening when one of Vader's soldiers bumps his head on the door and you can hear the ""thunk"" noise. No one cut it and it didn't ruin the movie.3. Stunt Casting- I'll have to agree on that one. The best performances were from the actors that I didn't recognize. Jennifer Hudson, Dame Judy Dench, Ian McKellen (sorry, he was still amazing), James Cordon, Taylor Swift, and the worst piece of casting, Rebel Wilson. She was in all the Pitch Perfect movies so I expected better from her. Expanding the roles of the ""famous"" actors took away from the ensemble feel of the piece itself. They were terribly miscast. Yes, the diversity of the cast expanded, Deuteronomy, the only black character in the musical was changed to a white woman who had to keep changing octaves to sing her songs. Meanwhile many white characters were made Black which worked I guess but I think the piece would have been better served with amazing Broadway actors. Not worrying about the diversity of the CGI cats. The Calicos were still orange. Lol.4. The music. Again 90% was just like the stage musical. The only think that really made me angry was that they changed the melody of the song Mungojerry and Rumpleteaser. Why? I liked it the way it was. I understand why they have to cut the timing on songs like Macavity because Broadway musicals tend to run three hours or more with an intermission. Movies don't have intermissions anymore.5. Taylor Swift was only in the movie for one song. If Taylor Swift is why you saw the film, you went for the wrong reason. The John Legend Jesus Christ Superstar got all kinds of accolades and awards and I hated it. I wanted to see Alice Cooper, but, guess what? He was only in one song as he played King Herod. I thought he would have been better served as Pontius Pilate, a much larger role, yet no one gave it one star for that reason and I thought Ms. Swift was quite capable singing probably my favorite song from Cats.Look at film adaptations of other Broadway musicals: A Chorus Line, Man of La Mancha, Camelot, Annie, Oklahoma, Sweeney Todd, Hair and many others. These films took much more liberties with the music; cutting songs, adding others, changing the sex or race of the main characters. Holy Cow! In the movie adaptation of Hair they changed the story so much that most of the songs sung by Claude in the musical were sung by Burger because Treat Willians was a better singer and looked more 60's,That's Hollywood ladies and gentlemen and that's why we need to take those things into account before writing off an entire production.I get more angry with Disney who makes money doing Broadway versions of movies or making live-action movies from animated ones. The Lion King? Live-Action? Ummm I don't think so as lions can't talk. The movie is still animated but in a different style, yet no one complains. I resent having to pay many times over to see the same story. Why is Cats picked on so horribly. If they had cast the movie better, it would have sounded better, but the chorus numbers sounded exactly the same as the show. Give the film a break. It wasn't that bad and, if you made it through the whole review, I'm proud of you for listening to the opinion of someone who might feel differently than you do.May the Cats be with you.",Cats

1289,wysoserous,What a way to wrap up a decade!,10,7 January 2020,"I went to see this film the night before the New Years, so it makes it the last movie I watched in the 2010's. And I regret nothing. This thing was a real spectacle, from its plot and attempts at humor, to obviously the character designs and CGI - everything was wonderfully horrendous.If I was ever starting to feel bored by the story or the absence thereof, I would just pay attention to the mess that is this movie's visual effects. Cats' feet (or should I say ""paws"") would get stuck in the textures or slide across the floor without ever interacting with it; their shoes would magically appear and disappear in different shots; faces on the background would sometimes become PS1-level rudimentary and just levitate separate from the bodies. Basically all the visuals in Cats are the creation of pure chaos but without them the movie is extremely boring. While it has some kind of a story, it drags entirely too long. All that matters is the last 15 minutes of the film, which are not even that good, aside from Jennifer Hudson's performance, which is probably the only unironically good part of the movie. The rest of Cats is just pointless and kind of sleep-inducing. Attempts at humor are the next level of cringe, especially Corden's and Wilson's parts. And some of the character designs look like side effects of Hermione Granger's potion from the Chamber of Secrets mixed with a very poorly performed transfiguration spell.Overall, Cats is one of the most memorable films of 2019 and, dare I say, of the decade for all the wrong reasons. I will definitely rewatch it once it comes out on Blu-ray and laugh my as* off one more time.",Cats

Nothing just soulless singing. Compared with the original Cats musical this is 1% of the quality.2) acting was crap and not because of the cast but because of the way it was presented. Always got interrupted.....3) bad visual effects. BIG problems with scale. The cats wore as big as a car or as little as the thickness of the railway. NONSENSE.4) BORING.

1294,GuillermoDelRomero,"Absolutely nightmare, absolutely recommended",1,23 February 2020,"Everyone complains about their job, it's just what we do. No matter what you do for a living thank yourself that you don't have the job of writing the synopsis to go on the back of the Cats DVD case as it'd be a truly impossible, tortured job. The only comfort anyone involved in this feline fantasy chore of a 110 minutes is that they sure walked away with their share of the (even more insane) budget. Even Idris Elba, who managed to sell the PG13 version of Roland in the recent Dark Tower, struggles to hide the fact he evidently didn't want to have the job of the hat wearing villain in this musical monstrosity.Cats opens up with a scene of a cat being dumped from a bag into the streets of London and soon met with a cavalry of crazy human shaped cats content on singing about everything and anything; many of the songs have little to no context such as an early song about how cats must have three names, a point that's soon dropped and never mentioned again. I've honestly never seen a film before where I've come away having no idea what it was actually about, move along Kubrick and 2001 Space Odyssey, the real question is what this is all about and why anyone would spend the $80 to $100 million making this nightmare. Is this how my grandmother felt watching The Matrix*?Speaking of the budget, surely majority of the money was allocated on the PR machine as its evident that the film is unfinished; in Judi Dench's introduction she is wearing a gold ring with a green gem on her left hand (a cat in the background is also wearing a ring) later this disappears and is replaced with a smaller ring, rumoured to be her wedding ring, on her left hand. Sometimes the cats have furred hands, sometimes they don't bother animating that in. The whole film suffers floaty head syndrome, caused by issues when the animators can't or don't have time to track the skin onto the actors giving the whole film even more uneasy feel to the look and movement.I suppose musicals don't have to adhere to the three act structure however this film doesn't seem to have any structure to it whatsoever and wraps up with a cat chosen by the Dench cat as the one who will ascend the skies in a magic hot air balloon, I couldn't explain that cat's background all I know is 1) she cries a lot when singing and 2) she seems to have some history with Elba cat who has magical powers; I shit you not, he's not even the only magical cat in this Lloyd Webber acid trip. Elba cat frequently turns up at the end of the musical numbers to magic a cat off to a barge on the river Thames that is ran by Ray Winstone cat (and yes, the former hardman has a number of his own, sans any auto tune) as apparently the cat who sings the best song shall be the one who rides the balloon? I've never seen the Broadway musical Cats before so I can't speak whether that follows any kind of internal logic to it however the ""cats"" here wear clothing, sometimes, (the number with a dozen cats tap dancing on a railway line has to be seen to believed) whilst the Ian McKellen cat wears gloves with the fingers cut off and a coat over an old cardigan yet drinks out of a bowl of water (whatever McKellen got paid, wasn't enough) and Rebel Wilson cat unzips her cat skin twice to reveal a dress on top of another cat skin (I am not making any of this up, honestly).Though I am sure neither the half-dozen people that went missing from my screening or my son, who kept leaning over to inform me that he didn't understand ""what is going on"", will not agree with me I would 100% recommend that everyone puts this on their bucket list as proves that when Hollywood misses the mark it always best they do it in spectacular fashion. One thing for sure I will not have a tipple before bed tonight as I don't want to risk any of this thing haunting my dreams.*somehow The Matrix with all its ground breaking SFX and set pieces cost $20 million less to make than Cats.",Cats

I'm a huge fan of the series having seen the stage and dvd versions, memorized the songs and the poems (including Rhapsody on a windy night - basis for memory). The movie is wonderful in it's own right by creating a plot out of a series of poems. McCavity is flushed out into a full character. The new song fits in perfectly. The pirate does not get his love duet sadly. There are a ton of Easter eggs in the background. A woman next to me who was unfamiliar with the musical picked up on the plot easily and laughed along. I can not understand why there are so haters of this movie. It does things that the stage version can not do.

Well the reviews are correct, it was horrendous! It bothers me people who havent seen the stage show may now boycott it if they watch this abomination of film. I was concerned that moving from theatre to screen the story may loose its charm.... it lost everything on screen including the audience as some people literally walked out of the cinema.
Even the basics were out.
Idris Elba played the infamous Macavity... now for those of you unfamiliar in the song Macavity a feral cat and is specifically described s the following :-
ginger cat
he's very tall and thin
eyes are sunken in
His coat is dusty from neglect, his whiskers are uncombed....
They literally sing these lyrics as a beefy sleek brown kitty version of Elba dances around the stage...Wtf! Not to mention the repitching of the songs, poor CGI and inconsistent scale to every day objects ...just to name a few things
Absolutely terrible.... I wish I could unsee it I really do.
I have come back home and have the immediate urge to watch the recorded version of the stage show just to remind myself how much I lovd it and try to forget the horror that tortured my eyes and ears last night.
I've only rated this a 2* as opposed to a 1* as I think very young kids may enjoy it... but that's not a big compliment as that audience still picks their nose and thinks peppa pig is an on screen marvel.",Cats

The mice are somehow more disturbing than the cats, and don't get me started with the cockroaches.Human hands on cats look wrong. Human feet on cats look wrong. Human eyes and noses on cats look very very wrong. We liked the little cat ears; they were cute. Tails have a life of their own.Of the cats, Mr. Mistoffelees and Old Deuteronomy were our favourites. Judy Dench somehow manages to remain regal in the face of all those cat bums and writhing tails.Gus the Theatre Cat proves that Gandalf is an animagus. Just not a very good one.To sum up, it was an experience and I'm not sure that the kids and I will ever be quite the same again. Andrew Lloyd Webber has a lot to answer for.

The comedy is awful. It looks awful (it actually made me feel sick). The CGI looks like it was done by a drunk film student. The cinematography is awful and covers up the choreography (the only thing the movie maybe had going for it). There's a cut like every 2 seconds and it is way too zoomed in half the time. Even the music with all the celebrity voices and talent behind it, is bland at best. Also the singing and sound mixing is done in a way that you can barely understand the lyrics, which is important given that the movie is ENTIRELY SINGING. Yeah, that's right, there is no dialogue in this movie, and you can only half understand the singing. It doesn't even matter, considering the movie has like, no story. There is nothing, and I mean NOTHING good about this movie. Don't see it.Love Musicals? Don't watch this. The music isn't good, and the choreography is covered up. The story is awful. I wouldn't even listen to the music on Youtube. Watch ANY other musical movie. I like musicals myself. But this? No.Like Cats, the musical? Don't watch this. I've never watched Cats, but based off of what I hear people like about Cats, this takes away anything you could've liked about Cats (choreography is covered up, costuming is gone cause its all CGI, and music is bleh)Think it'll be funny to riff on? No. Don't. Do anything else. Don't make the same mistake I did. Go out for dinner with a friend. Take a nice stroll. Play video games. You could stay in bed all day for all I care.

1333,samsullivannn,Amazing and Beautiful,8,20 December 2019,"People honestly need to stop hating on this movie. Yes, there are people dressed as cats singing and dancing. Just like in the musical that was a smash hit for many many years. And no, they aren't in costumes like they are in the musical because 1) this is a movie, not a live production, and 2) it's 2019 people, fuzzy leg warmers and headpieces would still look weird regardless. It's about time we put our amazing technology to use to creat new and fantastical worlds. Cats has always been a strange and magical journey, and I believe this movie follows that same criteria, even with the alterations it made.I recently became a fan of cats because I heard about this movie and I wanted to see for myself what the original was like. And boyyy was it wild. The plot was interesting, albeit not the easiest to follow without some background, and the music and dancing was phenomenal. So I was very excited to see this movie and watch a modern take on this older musical. I know that the trailers were met with a TON of hate, and I never understood it, even when I didn't know a thing about Cats. The CGI is AMAZING, and the actors behave as if they were actually cats. And the MUSIC. Yes, a few numbers were a bit odd and different from the original, but most of them were still there and in tact in some way. And Victoria's new song was just so amazing and moving. The dancing was spectacular, and acting was superb.The plot is a bit different than the musical, with Mcavity showing up far more and Victoria having a more central part. But it WORKED. Victoria's backstory worked and made the audience connect with her instantly, and having her be the new cat and have everything be explained to her was really a smart move on the story writer's part.All in all, Cats is different than the original live show, but honestly it works for this day and age. The props, CGI, and acting was amazing, and songs like ""Memory"" and ""Beautiful Ghost"" hit where they needed to. I think people need to give it a chance, because it really is a true masterpiece that should be given the credit it deserves.",Cats

The Broadway show is a string of catchy songs, with some dancing, and very little plot. This is no different. Don't expect a story. Expect to be entertained. The movie builds on the Broadway show and does what is meant to do: entertain. Don't expect oscar winning plot lines. Critics need to be aware of what the movie is working with before they hammer it. The movie is well done. It exceeded my expectations.",Cats
1340,keelymaunder,Gutted is an understatement,1,20 December 2019,1 hour and 50minutes of my life I will now be getting back. Even my children were disappointed. For the cast of big names I was expecting something spectacular but instead it was one of the worse films I have ever seen,Cats
1341,merlimax-47821,Purrrrfect,10,20 December 2019,Francesca Hayward's 'Victoria' takes centre stage in this remarkable portrayal of the original West End production of Cats. The score compliments the original 'Webber' magic and stays true to the stage show. Judy Dench's portrayal of 'Old Deuteronomy' worked incredibly well considering the original was a male role whilst Jennifer Hudson's 'Grizabella' doesn't fail to give you goosebumps at the end of the film. Rebel Wilson ( Jennyanydots ) and James Corden ( Bustopher Jones ) seemed to play themselves very well and a nice little touch from Ray Winstone ( Growltiger ) gets typecast and the cap fits very well. A very well made sentiment to the original stage show that those who have seen the West End show will understand totally. If you have never seen or heard the score then the film might not sit well with the viewer. Anthropomorphism at its absolute finest. I loved it,Cats

This is a full on musical, with endless songs. It's the stage show bought to life.I personally didn't like the stage show but really enjoyed the film.. You can connect to the characters more and understand the story better because it's a film set, not a static stage.Moral of the story: If you don't like musicals, don't watch Cats.

I thought that the movie was pretty good.....if for no other reason to see wonderful people do CAT things and sing those wonderful songs. I enjoyed every minute if this movie. It's beautifully drawn musically, choreographied, and scenically. The plot was tweaked and made better (yes, it's thin but it works for this play/movie). I thought Frances was impressive as hell and only overshadowed by Dame Judith Dench. And Jennifer Hudson....WOW! Her interpretation of 'Memory' brought me to tears (unexpected). Rebel Wilson and James Corden obviously had fun and, while I'm not a big fan, Taylor Swift was good! Idrid Elba was perfectly cast as was Ian McClellan.
Songs were re-arranged, items added (mice, cockroaches..eeww), and, what to me was a nod to 'Phantom', a rising chandelier....a few things that made the movie quite interesting to watch unfold...",Cats

-Almost no script except songs. This is ok for this type of film if the songs are good. They aren't.
-Poor CGI
-Poor acting
-Dreadful forgettable characters, i don't even remember any of their namesEssentially it's a terrible version of Rocky Horror Show, that has human ""cats"" instead of men dressed as women.This film has no positives aspects whatsoever, people were laughing in a bemused way when the film ended.

1349,bxgirl-54224,Am I the only one that likes this film?,8,21 December 2019,"This film is based on the smash Broadway musical, and I thought it stayed fairly true to that show, as I remember it. So, going in knowing that, I enjoyed it. Lots of reviews saying there's no plot, not true! There IS a plot, albeit a very simple one. The cats are vying for the chance at a new life by being chosen by Old Deuteronomy (Judi Dench) at the annual Jellicle Ball.
I will admit there were a couple of weird moments, like when Judi Dench raises her leg in the air after watching Gus the Theater Cat's performance (played sweetly by Ian McKellen). But I thoroughly enjoyed all the performances, the dancing, and the singing. Jennifer Hudson performing Memory as Grizabella will make you tear up, I don't care who you are.......
If you are a fan of the musical, you will probably like this movie. If you know nothing of the musical, you should probably acquaint yourself with it first, otherwise none of it will make sense, and you will think it's just weird.
I liked it!!!",Cats
1350,hannah_blackham,Wow!!,9,21 December 2019,"If it wasn't for some issues with CGI, I would say this is just as good as the musical. Great depth to characters and Explanation of the movie throughout. Having Victoria as the main character and basing it around her... genius. Update of all of the songs And the characters really made it their own. A lot of well known names although happy that they weren't really main characters as the less known actors were much better. Absolutely loved the movie and just made me want to see the musical again. Unpopular opinion but I absolutely loved it!!",Cats

James cordon and rebel wilson were so funny tho!! other than that the movie really sucked and it's a one star for me.,Cats

1355,siwolf,Good adaptation of the Broadway Stage Musical,7,21 December 2019,"#Cats the #review
TLDR: a good adaptation of the classic BROADWAY MUSICAL.I have read the critics reviews too, and I'll just say, none of them have been to the actual theatre to watch this.I have seen CATS twice in person, in London.This is NOT a movie, do not o expecting to be such a thing.
This IS a big screen adaptation of a musical performance that would require a massive stage.The scale, i believe is perfect. as they state ""Jellicle cats are small""the new songs were very goodMunojerry and Rumpleteasers song.... to me was very flat, lacked the punch of the Broadway partner.Sir Ian Mckellen and Dame Judi Dench were fabulous in there roles, an absolute delight to see their portrayals.Idris Elba was also executed the role of Mcavity superbly.The part that i do agree with the critics (at the start only) is the odd creepy factor seeing the CG of the cats, mice, roaches..... but halfway through the second song that is lost and the cats appearance is accepted and more or less normal. In fact, the ears and tail lend an emotive capacity that couldn't exist in stage.Jennifer Hudson was outstanding, her rendition of Grizabella and associated songs were properly moving. This is not a part one could have done halfway, she owned it.I was irked the Peeks and Pogs story with Rumpus cat wasn;t in it... but it doesn't really add to the story in how they were telling it.After reflection i have accepted the Mr Mistoffoles adaptation. Here he is portrayed more as the starting out magical cat, shy and unsure, instead of the great showman comfortable and in full control of his power that is portrayed in the theatre.Taken as what it should be, a tour of Jellicle lives, characters, stories, on the eve of their (well one of their) rebirth, being relayed to a newcomer (Victoria) who is unsure if they can fit in with the new stray society they were thrust upon as an unwanted. *and you are just along to witness her journey",Cats
1356,laurasbright,A review from a Cats fan.,9,29 December 2019,"This was brilliant! I can see how people who haven't seen the stage show would have been mildly traumatised by the CGI, but if have seen the real musical and had a real human being playing a cat rub up against you, then it's marvellous!! The music is true to its original form and the spirit is 100% there. Highly recommended - but you should probably watch the stage show production first if you haven't already!",Cats
1357,gisellehzj,My eyes are bleeding,1,21 December 2019,"I think this film is overrated, I had high hopes going to see this film because the musical was good but it isn't good when you have the entire movie just singing about cats!! I didn't even understand what a jellical cat was and I found it really annoying.There's no plot to it and I wish it had some kind of backstory or at least some drama but it was terrible. I was bored out of my seat and waited for it to finish. It was so boring. They wouldn't stop screeching their voices.It's like that film you watch and you forget about for years like some nightmare",Cats
1358,tomczamk,Stop it! You need to like the original to get it!!,10,21 December 2019,"I loved it! They didn't STRAY much at all from the original. It's just cats dancing song after song. Of course there is really no plot, there never was! I found the imagery to be neat and odd. I honestly think they took a big risk releasing something like this to the general audience. They could have changed it to make it appeal to the masses which would have yielded a better profit and review. But I'm personally glad they stayed true to what it is.",Cats

Guess what, we enjoyed it. People say they liked the musical but not the movie due to the music. It was the same music except for 1 new song and the music for one song changed but the words were the same. I didn't want it to end and wished they had added a few more songs. The visuals were amazing and I loved the little mice. Also glad that they made Victoria the new cat to explain what was happing which I had to do for the broadway musical. Yes it was different but it was suppose to be.",Cats

The dancing was fantastic and the comedic asides had us chuckling away.Jennifer Hudson really captured the emotion of her character, and has a beautiful voice, Judi Dench was wonderful and the way Victoria was incorporated into the storey was clever and heart warming.For people not familiar with the musical the story will probably seem a bit thin and the dance breaks may pall if that's not something that people enjoy, but Cats is about the spectacle rather than the plot and I found this film spectacular.",Cats
1368,torybelle,Utterly magnificent,10,22 December 2019,"I must say I am unspeakably disappointed with the negative reaction! This film was incredibly powerful drawing I into a completely different universe which is rare considering the film industry moves so fast quality is forgotten for quantity. If you are unable to handle innovation then sure stay at home but it is only yourself you are punishing. Different has always historically had backlash but you would think when today we pride ourselves for having an open mind you could handle some cgi. So, go against the grain and take a chance on arguably one of the best films you shall see because in this next decade I am sure the technology shall be repeated endless times but never feature the whimsicalality captured.",Cats
1369,sammyjoevans,Loved it!,9,22 December 2019,Loved it ! Especially if you get the musical which has a thin story line anyway. They simply add Victoria as the host where all cats introduce themselves to her instead of addressing the audience/viewer and macavity has a purpose of making each individual cat who is in the running for being re born disappear so that he could be chosen! This is something the stage version lacked. Jennifer Hudson made me cry. Only think I would say is a little more dancing at points :),Cats

And then I realized, it's just under the wrong genre.Cats is the best psychological thriller of our time.The plot focus around a ritualistic killing in a cult from the point of view of a new comer and through glitchy special effects and just straight weird mumbo-gumbo becomes one of the best psychological thrillers of our time.",Cats
1372,jessiehartley,"Despite what seems to be popular opinion, I enjoyed this film",9,22 December 2019,"I thought the actors and singing did a good job of capturing the characters and performing the songs from the original musical. One of the too complaints has been about the CGI however, in my opinion, it would be very difficult to carry off a movie like this using real costumes (like in the musical) and I don't know what they would have done without a CGI background (which I thought was incredibly well crafted and contained a lot of detail)
Overall, I think people have judged this movie too harshly. I felt it had a fantastic atmosphere that you hope for with any musical of this calibre and that the costume animators did the very best they could to create something appropriate for the silver screen.",Cats

Now I went with my partner and his daughters who only thought it was OK but they've never seen the original or watched many musicals.

I find it really sad that it's getting such bad reviews and have come to the conclusion that many of the people have either never seen the west end show or it wasn't their cup of tea when they did but still went to the movie. I loved the west end show. I understand the concept of the Jelicle cats and that this is not your typical story told the way the masses expect. If people think them looking like cats is creepy - did you even see the stage show - it's the same!
Best bits: Victoria the abandoned kitten linking the scenes between each cat character was beautiful & a lovely dancer, the tap dancing Skimbleshanks & Jennifer Hudson belting out Memories was an amazing performance. I even liked the new song from Taylor Swift called Beautiful Ghosts. Will be seeing it again - so there critics!",Cats
1378,pricolloyd-72731,Great interpretation of a great stage show,8,22 December 2019,If you head to the cinema to watch Cats and expecting Die Hard or Disney then you bound to be disappointed. Cats is a stage show and one I didn't quite get until seeing the Film. Yes it lacks the sweeping landscapes of Les Misérables but this was a stage show about alley cats set in London. It's was a stage production on a round stage. This film brings that stage show to life once again and puts it on a bigger stage with more sets. I feel sorry for the reviewers who obviously lack the experience of seeing the show live or reading TS Elliot. So be quite the critic who enjoys the latest Marvel and I implore anyone with an ounce of intelligence to head to the cinema and enjoy this as much as I did.,Cats

It was different, replicated a theatre vibe very well (which was the intention) and put a smile on my kids faces.
The 3 year got bored at parts but the 7 year old loved it.The team obviously worked very hard on all aspects of the movie and that came across, the visuals were very interesting and although it was dark in places it didn't affect my opinion.

I can understand why some people can see it as ""cringey"" because human actors are playing literal cats and acting out what cats would do and interact as. The cgi takes a little getting used to but once you get used to it it's totally fine. Rebel Wilson is hilarious, Taylor Swift actually wasn't too bad, James Corden is a great Bustopher Jones, Jennifer Hudson is amazing, and (as a dancer myself) the dancing is great with all the talented dancers alongside Robbie Fairchild and Francesca Hayward! All the same songs even-though some changed tune or tempo and a new song (for Victoria) which was pretty good. The little extra scenes made people who don't know the musical understand the overall plot. It's a written for Broadway show turned into a movie and I think they did a pretty good job.

1387,cjericho-89366,A hugely misunderstood epic adaptation of a classical stage show that in itself defied logic and reason,10,23 December 2019,"In my honest opinion, and I feel a bit alone in this, the Cats movie is an amazing retelling of a truly captivating (and justifiably so) musical spectacle. A lot of the reviews of this movie are unfair in my opinion. Was it strange looking at people CGI'd as walking, talking, singing and dancing cats?? Yes....but no stranger than watching people dressed as cats singing and dancing on a stage. Was the story a little confusing? It would be yes...for somebody who has no idea what the musical is about.Once again I feel that the opinions of some reviewers of this movie are unfair and not a just reflection as to what was attempted rather successfully with this movie which in reality is a film...based on a successful Broadway show...based on a book...all about singing and dancing cats...who have their own personalities...their own likes and dislikes...kind of like every individual person on the planet...With all that said however, in my opinion, you cannot have such a massive disliking for something that you do not truly understand.P.S. This movie was amazing....in my opinion :-)",Cats

They both came out the same day and I'm so over that corporate money making monster franchise.I gotta admit, when I first walked in the movie and saw the beginning, I was like ""oh boy, wtf did I do?..."" and I was very confused and not understanding a thing. Mind you, I've seen, heard, knew ABSOLUTELY NOTHING about this play or the history of it by Andrew Lloyd Weber. Growing up, I was never at all exposed to broadway and theatre. Yes, I've visited NY/London but never ever been to a play (I know, sad lol).Ok, this movie was a whole ROLLER COASTER of emotions! I mean, who doesn't love cats? If you don't like/love cats, go fys. Go home and don't see this and don't continue reading....You really didn't have to follow along the details of the plot. I didn't get the ""Jellicle"" this and that at all during the movie but that's ok. I believe the film makers had that in mind. When they made this film, they were not only trying to appease the hard-core fans of this play but also expose it to a younger, unaware audience (Gen-Z's & Millenials). An audience that, were it not for the access and the relatability of the movie theater, would never had known about this world of broadway and theatre. Now, because of this film, I'm going to make it a priority to see a broadway show the next time I'm in NY/London/LA because those people really work hard in their performances and you end up appreciating their effort.This film:
The actingThe set designersThe costumesThe VFX (woohoo!)The singingThe choreographyThey were all amazing. Bravo to you folks!! I truly hope the Academy Awards nominates you and you win. As I said, you didn't have to follow along that well the story line because I didn't understand some of the lyrics of the songs but all you had to do was wait for a Cat to show up with a song that you like and YOU'RE HOOKED. Now I understand why so many famous artists and singers signed up for this film. It tells of a beautiful story that I now know the history of and WISH I had known about it before.I've asked everyone that saw Star Wars ""Did the audience get up and applaud?"". The answer was: yeah, the nerds and the enthusiasts got up and clapped. ""Did people cry and laugh in your film?"" Yeah, they did. Well guess what?....So did the audience in Cats. There were people young and old. Grandmas and grandpas, moms and dads, and children of all ages. Everybody laughed, cried, sniffled, gasped, worried, sang and smiled.This was a wonderful film. I truly appreciate the work those people did to create this production. It was great. I'm going back to see it a 2nd time in the theater because I was invited the 1st time and I actually wan't to give my own money to support this film lol. Thank you guys! :)",Cats

People who resent that probably aren't fans of the original work either. If you enjoyed the theatre production, trust me that this film does it justice.They took large risks, and it was everything I wanted to be. Alien, saturated, and impressionist.

1391,jkayleighmay,Not what everyone says,9,23 December 2019,I will admit before watching this I was sceptical because of all the reviews saying how bad it was. Honestly it was better. The story was clear and entertaining. The soundtrack was amazing and every song is memorable enough that you'll be singing them when the movie is finished. The cast in it are brilliant and each character is likeable in their own way. What you need to realise is this is based on a musical which was based on the book. I don't know what movie others were watching but I loved the one I was watching.,Cats
1392,sunshinebrookiecookie,Not as bad as it's made out to be,5,23 December 2019,"Honestly, the musical was just as creepy.Bad parts of the movie:-It made no sense-very random-No plot-Weird camera angles-Weird movements-Extremely creepy-Taylor swift had too little screen time-The CGI-It was released the EXACT day star wars came out (Don't know what they were thinking there...)
Good parts:-Jennifer Hudson-Taylor Swift-Choreography (other than the creepy movements)-Memory-something of a plot (okay, not really but its more than the musical had)-fun to watch (if you can get past the creepiness)-The voices-Macavity is such a fun villain-The songs tunes (The lyrics don't line up but the songs themselves are catchy)",Cats

Sadly, from a media perspective this film neglects to introduce character's backstories and their reasons for the dispute they have against each other. It also fails to follow Todorov's narrative theory - the villain does not get his comeuppance and therefore there is no real cathartic ending, instead in my opinion, the film leaves you empty, confused and angry that 2 hours and high expectations have been wasted. Taylor swift is also in it for a total of about 4 minutes and therefore should not be the face of this movie.

I saw my Own cats in the mannerisms of the actors, the movement of their tails and ears, their nuzzling, and even the hisses. Francesca Hayward as Victoria is beautiful as she gracefully navigates the world of Jellicle Cats. And Dame Judi Dench adds her wisdom and elegance. Admittedly, the movie requires a bit of imagination, a belief in magic and a bit of whimsey, all in distressingly short supply these days. I am a Cats lover!!!",Cats

1399,gambierkate,Give Cats a chance,7,24 December 2019,"My family had waited a long time to go and see Cats, yet because of the reviews by so many critics, I entered the cinema with a sense of dread. How dare they; it was a fun rendition with all the great song and dance performances from the live show. In fact, by pivoting on Victoria and pulling in some additional story for Macavity, it provided a simple a plot-line; something that the original show lacked.
The movie was by no means the Godfather, and there were some weird special effects, but then the Broadway show wasn't exactly Hamlet either and it ended as one of the longest running musicals ever. All I can think of is these people never saw the live show of Cats, and in this cynical day and age, would have hated it anyway.
Movie critics tend not to like adaptations of Broadway musicals; so given that the live Cats was itself an adaptation from a thin volume of odd poems by TS Elliot, this was always going to be a bit of a stray movie-wise.
So, if you enjoyed the original Cats - go and see this movie to decide for yourself. It's worth it for James Cordon nailing Bustopher Jones; Rebel Wilson eating human cockroaches; the Fiend of the Fell - Ian McKellan; Idris Elba in fur; and the incomparable Jennifer Hudson, who took ""Memories"" to the moon and back.",Cats

Well, you'd be wrong -- so very wrong. Sadly nothing can save this tragic furball-of-a-film from being regurgitated from the bowels of kitty hell onto your silver screen, just in time for Crimbo! Shiver in your seat with cringeworthiness. You will wish you had stayed at home with your real (non-hideous) kitty and saved your hard-earned cash, rather than throwing your money down the drain full of meowing despair, badly animated cockroaches, matted cat hair and the thick tears and bogies of ugly-crier 'Memories' bawler Jennifer Hudson as snotty trails repeatedly thickly stream over her septum in a less-than-aesthetically-pleasing preserved bid for realism amongst a vomit of lacklustre blurry chaos. Did you think stars like Idris Elba and James Corden would glow amongst this catpee? Did you think that the proportions of the cat sizes would make it in any way endearing? Be assured that at least when you get to the credits, you can finally turn to your friends, crack up laughing and say ""WTF?""Dreary, emotionally-lacking and abominable would be a kind way of describing this miserable wreck of a 3D-animators' kaleidoscope of disaster. It's almost so awful in its weak narrative and appalling animation that it's entertaining how bad it is: like Justin Bieber's Baby or Rebecca Black's song Friday, a target for bullying and ridicule beyond measure... but perhaps with a valid point that even the best of intentions cannot make a flat artwork redeeming. You cannot help but wonder... what on earth were they thinking? As for the dancing, well with CGI you cannot even begin to appreciate any of the fluidity of the movements because you're stuck in a vortex where every part of Cats looks terrifyingly awful and there is definitely no way out.

The scenery is beautiful and when Jennifer Hudson sings 'Memory' it just takes your breath away.
I reckon the negative reviews on here are from people who do not realise that 'Cats' is a musical ballet, based on a quirky TS Elliott poem book. If one was expecting a 'normal' film, there could be some confusion.

I've fancied seeing Cats at the theatre so what better than to watch the big screen version, finely honed to perfection?
Style was of the Polar Express variety, which can work well. The effect was poorly realised.
The opening music was a bit rubbish 70's electronic, but I'm a child of the era so the music must get better, right? Sadly not. Surely the music in the stage show isn't so bad is it? I love a good musical.... and this wasn't.
James Cordon noted for his lack of acting ability. No surprise there.
The actors were heavily made up so hopefully can distance themselves from the whole ordeal and pretend it wasn't themselves playing the part.
I was stuck in the middle of an aisle so thought that sleep would save me. Unfortunately the poor music score kept me awake. I had to suffer the dreadfully poor acting and singing.
Curiously, some in the audience found humour in some of the lines and were laughing. I can only think that they've seen the stage play, so it's something familiar to them. I could find nothing amusing. I kept waiting for the story music and acting to improve. It didn't.
Half way through when I thought all hope was lost, my wife thankfully saved the day and said ""this is awful, can we please go"".

But, after all I cannot even say whom this movie was targeted to. People who like and know the musical would be very disappointed and not just because it's ""not like a stage one"". The thing is that despite the unlimited cinema abilities it lacks a very simple thing - the sound. It simply does not sound well, very flat and lifeless even for a simple stereo, not even mentioning Dolby sound that it's supposed to have. Well, there are many questionable deviations but for god sake, what was the reason to make old Deuteronomy a non-signing elderly woman?

But this should not affect your opinion on the performance itself. All dancers are super professional and the songs are beautiful. Cats is a classic and it's very difficult to adapt any theatre peace and put it on the big screens.

1423,simonhowe-45671,Just remember... This was written in the 1930's......,10,25 December 2019,"Look!
All you who 'Nay Say' this have not really understood this... It's a series of poems, set to music and dance, by Andrew Lloyd-Webber. It's a fantastic, and fantastical, journey through one night of a 'gang'... tribe if you will, of street creatures.
If this was filmed along the lines of 'West Side Story'... It would be a box office smash. A gang of youths who want to send one of their ailing kind to the otherworld.... Good Lord! Just what would the Marvel and DC world make of that? Blood? Guts? Angst? Violence? Abuse? Abusive language?
This has NONE of that! It's a fabulous romp through one night where there is an evil villain (McCafferty) and a beautiful heroine (Victoria) are butting heads (Many a true word there!) with the rest of the gang. There is a... Sensei?... Spiritual leader, if you must, who will choose who is to pass on to 'The Heavyside Layer'.
There is Magic! Spiritualism! Evil! Good! Love!
And a fantastic musical score and songs. PLUS... As an added bonus, a sparkling brand new song written by Andrew Lloyd Webber and Taylor Swift. It's heartachingly beautiful...
The dance routines are exquisite! Even Idris Elba gets in on the act... He's surprisingly good!
I will not spoil the rest of this gorgeous, exquisite, fun, happy and, above all, feel good film for you. Just go to see it. Open up your minds and eyes. Get immersed.
But just remember... The original poems were written back in the 1930's by T.S. Elliot, someone not known for his adherence to convention. Just hook your belief into the film within the first few minutes and enjoy it as a magnificent musical journey and romp. Enjoy the sounds, the songs, the awesome costumes (even though some find them a little weird and disturbing at first).
But most of all, just enjoy the absolute SPECTACLE of the film.
It's beyond superb!

1427,foulkbrad,CATS is the next Showgirls,4,3 February 2020,"I'm probably going to say something that has been already said, the original Andrew Lloyd Webber musical CATS is very flawed. I for example see it more as an interpretive ballet rather than a real musical like Sweeney Todd or Wicked. There was room for improvement and any filmmaker could've used the source material as a foundation for a much better musical movie. But that's not what happened.As far as I can tell, Andrew Lloyd Webber doesn't have any type of producer credit on this film. But man... the lack of adaptation has his fingerprints all over it. This film is just the stage show on a movie set with big name actors. It's the same issue that plagued the Phantom of the Opera film adaptation. Screenwriters Lee Hall and Tom Hooper didn't seem to try hard enough to make this musical work on the big screen. It seems like Webber and Director Tom Hopper seem to think that since the stage version won 7 Tony's, it will also win 7 Oscars if it's just the same musical with a few changes.There's at least 3 or 4 songs you could cut from this movie and have it not change a thing in the film but they're kept in because... shut up. Ian McKellen for instance has this solo as Gus the Theater Cat. It seems to last an eternity even though in reality it's only 4 minutes long. Seriously, why didn't they cut this? There are two fat cats played by Rebel Wilson and James Corden but... why? Does this movie really need two overweight comic relief characters? Webber really needs to figure out what the word ""Adaptation"" means.And yet... this is probably one of the funniest embarrassments of cinema I have ever seen in my entire life. CATS is destined to become a So Bad it's Good cult classic just life The Room, From Justin To Kelly, Mommie Dearest and yes... Showgirls.

However, as a real Cats fan, having seen the stage show four times, I was tempted to go and see for myself. And I thoroughly enjoyed it !!
The music and words were very faithful, the plot was rather more substantial than the original show and the dancing was good. Ok, the CGI was perhaps not perfect, however the stage show never tried to make the cats look 100% human, and it was never the goal. However, I think that you need to appreciate the fact that it is an adaptation and that the whole point of it IS the dancing and the singing to the words of TS Eliot, without a real plot.

The CGI was amazing it really looked like they where wearing fur or a catsuit with fur on with hoods, it was well blended into the actors & actresses.

1447,lauraeshepherd,Meh,5,27 December 2019,"This movie wasn't the worst as much as most say it is. Yes, the CGI was pretty poor and they used big names when they shouldn't have, but there was good things.They made Victoria a main character which she wasn't in the original and they casted well for her as she had a beautiful voice and is a principle ballet dancer. The movie also gave a bit more story, depth and clarification than the original which is good for people that struggle to grasp the plot originally and Jason Derulo's version of Rum Tum Tugger and Jennifer Hudson sang Memory brilliantly.Some cons though, Jennyanydots song in which featured mice and cockroaches was more disturbing than whatever the aim was. I also don't remember Munkustrap's name even being mentioned once and he was a main character, as for Judi Dench playing Old Deuteronomy, wasn't terrible but definitely a bold move to change the gender. They also needed to decide on whatever they attempted between Victoria and Mr. Mistoffelees. I think it was supposed to be a beginning of a romance but their needed to be better emphasis on it.I wouldn't recommend seeing the movie if you haven't seen or have no appreciation for the original, but overall, it wasn't terrible, but it could have been a lot better.",Cats

My daughter is very passionate about Cats, it's her favorite. We've seen it a couple times now (off Broadway) and she was in awe.

1449,kierstenkurtz,Nightmare fuel,1,27 December 2019,"Speaking from a dance teacher's POV, I have nothing against the choreography done by the classically trained dancers, but nothing could prepare me for the atrocities that were the hip hop cats. The A-listers in the cast made absolutely no sense, worst of all Taylor Swift who has made it clear that she cannot dance and is awkward with movement why in gods name would they put her in a ballet musical? Something I really focused on was the inconsistencies in the shoes of the dancers because some of the other things were too painful to look at, the high heels for the girl cats made no sense and the most outrageous part was Victoria's dancing in the middle of the movie. It was obvious to me that she had some form of pointe shoe on that allowed her to be on her toes but they edited it to look like she had bare feet. I know many adults would not be dumb enough to think she had bare feet but I can't stop imagining some poor child watching the movie and breaking her ankle trying to go on her toes without support or training. All in all this was a horrible movie and the only reason I saw it was for Steven McRae who I feel bad for having to be a part of such horrors. It makes me wonder just how many people had to think this a good movie for it to reach this point and that is terrifying by itself.",Cats

1451,idakitty,The reasons I hated this,2,27 December 2019,"Was not the fact that they casted famous actors in some roles. I was completely fine with Idris Elba, Judy Drench, Taylor Swift, and Hudson was great. I was NOT a fan of Jemima missing completely. I read that Andrew Lloyd Webber originally thought Victoria and Jemima should be one cat, but it was too difficult to find a role that could both dance and sing. My greatest annoyance is why go with that idea but cast it to someone who can do neither? Victoria should be doing splits and impressive dance acts right, left and center and the crystal clear soprano of Jemima to coerce Grizabella into keep trying would've been miles better than the new song they added. I was even ok with the talking, because I finally understood the plot. Just.. Add some cool parkour and dancing and proper singing. I'd much rather watch 2 hours of Cirque du Soleil that has nothing to do with cats with the soundtrack of the 1998 Cats film added to it than this. I don't know if they missed target audience or ran out of money on actors and CG to get some proper dancers, but please do this again in like 2025, and do it properly. This film was ok at best and should only be shown to little kids to make them understand the plot before taking them to the theatre or watching the 1998 film.",Cats

Now after watching it I felt compelled to write a review. It's not nearly as bad most reviews have made out. Now I'm certainly not going to tell you it's a great movie but it does have some positives. First and foremost it's a musical and it plays like a theatrical performance rather than a movie. It's quirky and odd in parts and feels disorganized and amateurish in others.

The DVD's (as there were two) that I used to watch are now so scratched from how frequently I would want to see Cats that the second disc is basically unwatchable past 10 minutes.So seeing this film really crushed my spirits and I feel just a little sadder with my life in general.But it's not all thunderstorms and sadness, my grandma (who had absolutely no prior knowledge of any other media Cats was portrayed in) really enjoyed the film and said that it was everything she loves in a film.I respect her opinion but I really can't force myself to enjoy what feels so fake and unloved (weird way of putting it, I know) by all those who had a part in the creation of this.",Cats

1467,bertrandbaba,Witness the cult culture of cats!,4,29 December 2019,"The title of my review sums up my feelings for this movie.I went into this movie fully understanding and accepting that I was going to watch an off-the-wall film about a cult of cats; and I suppose that helped a bit. I have always had a fascination with cultism. The idea of willingly subjecting and surrendering oneself to rituals, acts or processes that inevitably mean harm to oneself; seems like psychology worth unpacking. Unfortunately, I am neither interested or qualified to unpack it, but rather still intrigued with the process.There was a similar chatter about the movie 'Mother!', which I went into with the same expectations. This movie, cats, is simply a movie documenting a cult of cats, who thrive in their cult ways for a year and on a night, execute a necessary sacrifice to keep up motivation. Members of the cult are initiated and promised ""better lives"" if they follow the cult rules with a sense of want, complete loyalty and enthusiasm i.e they kill one of their own, because then how would they maintain their status as a revered cult?!Knowing all this, the movie worked, for me. There was a strangeness even to the music (I have never seen or heard the original broadway musical); and in the middle of it all, a burst of genius musicality! Which I presume was the intention for the entire movie, but unfortunately, only exists with this one sequence. I'm taking about the the sequence with the railway cat. The sequence finally takes us out of the dark alley, with a sense of glee and wonder, with this cat that thinks a bit too much of himself.Most, if not all of the technical criticisms of this movie are true and I can't deny or defend that. This movie for me, presented another angle of the cult documentary (from an animal/cat perspective). Animals can be sick in the head too! This movie has a fan in me! Unfortunately though, I'm not sure I count for much.",Cats
1468,aaa-65562,This movie was made to make us love the broadway show more,1,29 December 2019,"I have been browsing on IMDB for years but never made an account. I have to, just to write a review for this movie.As a musical fan and a singer myself, Cats is my favorite musical of all time. I love the characters, the songs and even the story. I used to watch the DVD at least once per week when I was small. This is how much I love Cats.Bad cinematography. Weird dancing sequences, though there are certain parts that are kind of good. Most of the characters have terrible acting. And the singing and the songs! Oh my, I still can't apprehend how they can butcher them so much. With a musical this great, you really have to be doing SOMETHING to make it so bad. Seriously, how can they butcher the song of Mungojerrie And Rumpelteazer like this? What were they thinking? I really have no idea.My girlfriend wanted to leave the theatre after this song, and it was her first time wanting to leave during movie. But we did not. Maybe the movie was going to be better, right? No, it just got worse.The only one who could sing in this whole movie, was Jennifer Hudson. Maybe Francesca Hayward as well. The other actors either were very boring and uninspiring, or simply lack the talent or training for singing. And the mixing was pretty bad as well. The music was always too loud, while the vocals were all too compressed and thus sounded very small, even for Jennifer Hudson.If only the story is better, Cats can be a better movie. But no. I appreciate they were trying to make something different, but different does not mean better. In the case for this story, many changes were for the worse. Macavity was a very plain villain, and was almost silly at times. There were background information thrown into the story, like Grizabella became who she was now because she had ran away with Macavity. But these elements were never explored in the movie.Instead, the plots were just too fast and too shallow. Most characters were not explored properly, while some were given too much screen time for no reason. The only plot which moved me a little was the interaction between Victoria and Grizabella. Apart from some touchy scenes, there was no tension in the story.Therefore, I have come to a conclusion: the whole purpose of this movie was to make us like and appreciate the broadway show more.",Cats

1471,jeffrichardson-19378,Judge for Yourself: A Broadway Play on Film Worth Seeing,8,29 December 2019,"Some film adaptations of Broadway musicals embellish upon and expand the play's story: think West Side Story. This film does not do that - after all it's a very simple story about a tribe of cats. Nor is it an animated Disney-like movie. Instead, the film brings the audience into, on and around the stage of the play. The dancing is excellent, the songs entertaining and I thought Francesca Hayward made an outstanding first performance reminiscent of Audrey Hepburn. With the exception of Taylor, who I don't think dug down quite deep enough, the other ""A"" list performers lived up to expectations. The movie isn't perfect but in the final analysis I think it is a gross mismatch in expectations that has lead to so many trash-talk negative reviews.P.S.

The movie did remain relatively faithful to the original Broadway plot. Of course people may not like that version - but that is the story for Cats. The music was largely the same as the Broadway show with one new tune co-written by Lloyd Weber and Swift - and that tune was not bad. The CGI had some misses, but overall was pretty good. The people turned into cats worked well. There were some great sets.You can't complain about Francesca Haywood. She's very talented and is a principal ballerina for The Royal Ballet. Her acting was pretty good, and she made the movie.James Cordon did an excellent job. Robbie Fairchild was very good. Judy Dench was not perfect, but overall I liked her and her role.The Bad
Jennifer Hudson had the best song and provided a terrible job of delivering it. Terrible. With all of her emotional gymnastics, the melody of the song was gone. Her song - Memories - is the most important number in the production. Disaster.Taylor Swift was irrelelevant. Her character had a 5-6 minute appearance late in the move for a single song. Who cares. The song was okay - an original she co-wrote. But she added nothing to the movie other than a name.Overall, the sound quality of the music was poor - and not as good as a typical live theatrical production. With the budget and the talent available, you expected better. It seemed to have been recorded during filming live scenes with background noise and inconsistent production values.Overall - I liked Cats. I've seen the Broadway production a couple of times, I knew what to expect, and it delivered. It's about Cats. There is no deep plot or story. Just enjoy it and have fun.",Cats

Not surprising, the theater was near-empty. At the end we turned to each other and said, ""That was good!"" ""I liked it a lot!"" It's a musical, it has dancing and singing. Is that the problem? The story flows easily from beginning to end. The costumes (with moving ears and tails) aren't creepy. Maybe we saw the edited version?",Cats
1492,fampaterson,Not deserving of 2.7 rating,7,31 December 2019,You know. It was a musical. It had lovely music and performances like Jennifer Hudson's. James cordon and Judy Dench. Taylor Swift too were well acted. I don't believe it is only a 2.7 rating. Look at the whole creative picture people !,Cats
1493,katastrxphee,I find this movie offensive. DO NOT WATCH!,1,31 December 2019,"So, I was hoping this movie would be like the musical. I LOVE the musical.WARNING: It's so bad that as a huge cat person AND a lover or the musical Cats, I find this movie extremely offensive. I'm not even joking.The plot is a huge mess. The songs are complete garbage. Don't even get me started on the CGI. I know that they put some sort of effort into this movie, but for 95 MILLION DOLLARS...this movie is a huge disappointment.They obviously casted popular celebrities like Taylor Swift, Jennifer Hudson and James Corden so people would be more interested in the movie. I'm sorry, but this is supposed to be a musical.If they really wanted this to be like the Cats musical, they wouldn't have casted the people they did. Yes, they are talented, but it just doesn't seem right to have James Corden or Taylor Swift in a musical-based movie (even though James' crosswalk musicals are hilarious.)Believe me when I tell you this--the target audience is probably for 3-year-olds. I would've left if I didn't pay for the ticket. Even if 3-year-olds saw this movie, they would probably have nightmares later. Please DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE. It's a waste of your time.",Cats

Bluntly put, the movie was dreadfull and a waste of time. The ONLY good thing about this entire movie was JHUD, but still not enough to salvage this movie. We decided to go watch a second movie at the theater right after this one to remove the taste of backwash this movie left in our mouths. Go see Star Wars instead.",Cats
1496,magickitty-00379,Much better than the internet hive mind says,10,31 December 2019,"Despite the negative reviews and attacks from the internet hive mind, I went to see this anyway. I enjoy most musicals, and I'd enjoyed seeing the stage production of Cats when I saw it as a teenager. I absolutely loved it. Sure, the human-cat hybrid CGI was a bit weird at first, but I got used to it by the end of the first song. The plot is light, but this is a movie you go see for the artistry, dancing, and music rather than the story. It was simply FUN. Highlights were Ian McKellan's Gus, and the Skimbleshanks song.If you like musicals, or if you were thinking of seeing it before the haters jumped on the hate bandwagon, go see it and decide for yourself.

My expectations were a bit on the lower side after watching every trailer and behind the scene videos released. Overall, the movie was pretty much as expected. A live action/cg version of the original.
The dancing was entertaining, especially Skimbleshanks' scene. It followed the same storyline as the musical, give or take a little. Victoria is given more of an active roll this time around and her own song. I'm bummed not all of the songs were included but I get it.
The only part that really bothered me was Rebel Wilson and James Corden's parts. Both characters were changed to cater to the actor's quirks and neither landed on the feet. Taylor's role was also really small compared to the way it was built up.
Overall, I enjoyed it. Great? No, but definitely enjoyable.",Cats

1509,brnss-34733,It gets better,8,2 January 2020,"Some of the reviews on this site are a bit harsh to say the least.
I have to be honest and say that the first 20 mins was pretty hard going if your not a die hard Lloyd Webber, tap dancy type, which I'm not, however, after about 20 mins or so it turns from a mediocre west end musical into a very good, moving film which is very well acted, and the costumes are superb.
So, for me, what was wrong with the first 20 minutes or so? I'm not entirely sure, but perhaps there was just too much dancing which didn't move the story on, which can make it drag, but I have to say when the intensity of the dancing backed off and the story and drama picked up, it was quite superb and I came out of the cinema having thoroughly enjoyed it.
So, in a nut shell, get through the first 20 mins and you will enjoy it.",Cats
1510,patriciakeller-21594,Don't understand the bad reviews,10,2 January 2020,"First off let me say I'm very familiar with the original Cats stage production (I saw the Cats musical with the original cast in London in 1986, in Zurich in 1995 and in Toronto in 2019) so I have something to compare the movie with. I was baffled by the negative reviews since my husband and I loved the Cats movie!Admittedly it differs in some aspects from the stage production. It's not entirely sung as the cats talk in between scenes and there is a slightly enhanced storyline. This made it in my opinion even more entertaining. I was not bothered by the fact that they switched one of the male cats (Old Deutoronomy) to a female cat in the movie. To me it was added value that they casted a principal ballerina as the lead (Victoria), which made for amazing dance scene. Jennifer Hudson's ""Memory"" was terrific. All the celebrities were highly enjoyable to watch. For everyone who loves the soundtrack of the Cats stage production, the music does not disappoint in the movie! It's very close to the original. Yes, the cats move, sing and dance in their furry suits and it made for a highly animated experience. What I also enjoyed in the movie is the set with the magical neon cityscapes, it was on a larger scale and more impressive than the stage.I can't say there is one thing I disliked about this movie and I'll give it a 10/10. I hope people will give it a chance and not be deterred by the many bad reviews!",Cats

I couldn't help but feel uncomfortable as I watched an hour and a half of cats nuzzling each other as their phallic tails moved in disturbing ways. Throughout the whole movie there was this odd sexual tension hanging in the air. The plot was nonexistent, and the whole movie was comprised of cats singing aimlessly about their names.

You can tell they spent time on getting the cat movements correct and the visual effects only enhanced the actors work.After seeing it for the second time I realised just how much I missed in the first viewing as there is so much to see on screen at one time.Thank you Tom Hooper and the rest of the cast, crew and production for doing the musical justice.",Cats

I nearly did not go because of all the bad critics and finally before they take it off the screen I have seen it and really enjoyed every second. Maybe the reason so many people don´t like it is because it is so different to anything else you would see in the cinema these days, but it is amusing, the dancing is top class with Francesca Hayward being a Principal ballerina from the Royal Ballet, first class singers, and keeping more or less to the story from the Musical. I recommend it.",Cats
1518,anq-90069,I tried to crack the Cats Code. #nocando,1,3 January 2020,"When I was a young teen, there was often an ad on WPIX Channel 11, featuring what appeared to be a mysterious and magical musical called ""Cats"". I never saw it and I never wanted to, but memorized the music from the ad and I know that it ran some 8000 shows in its time at the Winter Garden theater (somehow that theater name always stuck in my mind.) It was one of the longest running shows on Broadway, and having just seen the film tonight, I now know why.BECAUSE NO MATTER HOW MANY TIMES PEOPLE SAW IT, THEY STILL COULD NOT FIGURE OUT WHAT THE HELL IT WAS ABOUT.I knew the reviews were bad. They were also hilarious--things like ""this movie is what death feels like"". And despite having seen the trailer at Thanksgiving and thinking ""that's 2 minutes of my life that I will never get back"", the reviews became so much of a spectacle that I felt moved to go see it myself.Oh. Em. Gee.For starters, what in the fresh hell is a ""jellicle cat""? Even spell check doesn't know, because I just had to type that word 3 times. The computer wasn't even having it. The film opens with the only human in the film getting out of a car and discarding what is ostensibly a cat in a bag into a junk pile. It's too bad that's not what happened to the final version of this film.From there, we are introduced to cat after cat after cat, but to no real end. Every cat has a stupid name like Jenny Anydots or RumTumTugger. Painful. The only thing I got out of this cat line-up was that 1) CGI dancing cats make me carsick, 2) all of the cats here are jellicle cats and 3)one of the cats will be ""Jellicle Choice"" and (unless I heard it wrong) will ""go up over the building"". Oh, and watch out for the cat named Macavity because he's the villain. No reason why, no back story that was readily apparent. He's just the bad guy.Jennifer Hudson plays a cat called Grisabella and she is the one who sings the famous ballad ""Memory"" on the dark, depressing, wet street corner. When she comes out in the cat line-up for her close-up, 1) you can tell something is NOT right with her, and 2) you not only feel sorry for her sad, pathetic, downtrodden, sobbing cat character, you also wish it was not a close-up, because the beautiful and talented Jennifer Hudson has a line of snot coming out of her nose while she sings in THIS AND EVERY SUCCESSIVE SCENE. And when there is that much mucus on a big screen, it is very distracting, I'm just saying. She is also wearing an 80's church dress that is Bedazzled, with an old thrift store fur over it and her CGI fur is matted. I simply could not understand what was is going on with this sad cat. She is definitely a victim and it is mentioned or somehow inferred-in-song that she got mixed up with Macavity, but what is WRONG WITH HER? Does she embody like every bad thing that ever happened to a women? Like, is Macavity a cat-pimp? I'm so lost here. Also, someone get Jennifer a tissue, please. That bodily fluid added nothing to the story and no one needs to be caught like that on film.Next up is Dame Judy Dench, and I pray that she lives long enough to be in several more films because it would be a travesty for her to be remembered this way. She looks JUST like the lion in the Wizard of Oz in her cat-getup. OH, and her name is Old Deuteronomy and she is for some reason the one who chooses the cat who becomes the Jellicle Choice, at the Jeillcle Ball. (A ball at which we later learn, may I just add, that not a single cat has on a ball gown or a tux. #disappointing And also surprising because some of them do wear human clothes or accessories - but weird things like spats, hightop sneakers or long scarves. Some great ball gowns could have really enhanced this film, believe me.)Somewhere in there we meet a cat named Magical Mister Mistopholes. He is the Magic Cat. Because the rest of the cats who sing and dance and walk up right aren't magic? OKAYYYY, then.It bears mentioning that several of the songs have a catchy line in them: one catchy line that is sung 17 times in a row, followed by a ballet number featuring cats, then that same line sung another 34 times. We get it: NEVER was there ever a cat so clever as magical Mr. Mistphopholes. WE. GET. IT. ALREADY. We also learn AD NAUSEUM from Taylor Swift (who plays a forgettable cat) that Macavity is ""never on the scene"" when the police (cat-police?) arrive. He's a slippery one. Hold that thought.It seems like the cats all want to be the Jellicle Choice (this jellicle thing annoys me every time I type it because not only is it a made up word, my computer tells me I have spelled it wrong), but as soon as they voice that lofty cat-aspiration, Macavity (since they all have dumb names, why isn't he ""MaCATvity"", anyway?) comes down and pulverizes them into dust and sends them to be prisoners on a his boat floating in the Thames. 🤔And there are more cats. More and more cats. Memorable to me is the cat named Skimbleshanks, a jaunty and flamboyant cat who wears red pants and works on an Orient Express-like train. He tap-tap-tap dances us right on board that fancy train for a dance number that includes every cat from Bustopher Jones right on through to Mungojerry. #ImeanWTF The tap dancing was a nice break from the weird cat ballet and felt old-timey in all the right ways, especially when the cats danced in a line along the tracks and over a railroad bridge. The fact that I actually felt this is a measure of how far things had gone down hill by this time in the movie. Also, at this point, I think I heard a little girl behind me say ""Daddy, can we go?""Somehow they get to the Jellicle Ball (you would never know it is a ball because Cat Dame Judy Dench is lying in a huge sparkly cat bed, which is absurd). But son of a gun, here comes that pesky Macavity. He pulverizes Cat Dame Judy and everyone is #sad. But then the cats remind Magical Mr Mistopholes that he is MAGIC so he can bring Cat Dame Judy back to life. He has some self-esteem/performance anxiety issues, I guess, because they have to sing and chant how clever he is 45 times over and over to convince him and he keeps trying but failing to make Cat Dame Judy appear and finally she comes in behind them singing.The big finish is when Jennifer Hudson, nose still running and also still devastated (over what, we will never know), comes in, sings the grand reprise to ""Memory"" through the snot, and is-- surprise!-- named the Jellicle Choice. She and Cat Dame Judy nuzzle heads (so creepy and not the only time you see this weird move in this crazy fim]. So, as the grand prize Jellicle Choice, Jennifer's cat character steps into a beautiful, huge, chandelier-that-becomes-a-hot-air-balloon, and is lifted straight up through the skylight, off to what they refer to as ""Heaviside Layer"" for another life. MaCATvity jumps on to a rope to try to go with her but--you guessed it- slips off. And the only thing I can possibly make of this is that Cats is a Resurrection tale? Like the Jellicle Choice is the Chosen One? The cats are the apostles? MaCATvity is the devil? Judas? Cat Dame Judi is God, and that is why she can, in the final scene, break the 4th wall and sing right to me, while she gazes into my eyes to close the film. WHAT DID I JUST WATCH?It was so ridiculous. Maybe it's just not for Dog People. 🤷‍♀️ I honestly think this Broadway show owes its success to the 1980s theatre elite who did not want to admit how freaking weird it was and that they were completely lost and so just lied and said it was great because they were too cool to admit otherwise. We here in the year 2020 are evolved enough to admit it is Totally Cuckoo. But I can't say I hated it-- after all, my New Year's Resolution was to spend more time writing, and this has been my best impromptu writing prompt in a very long time.CATS- Zero stars",Cats

1535,HeraHarker,Catnip trip for cat persons,9,7 January 2020,"I saw it today, and I hardly believe the score. It's much better than that. Yes, it's a highly theatrical movie, based on loosely connected poems about singing and dancing cats, but it's kind of a given, isn't it? I knew what to expect, so I enjoyed it a lot.
The cast was great, with some great moments. Ian McKellen did as well as humanly (or catly) possible, his nostalgic charm was deeply touching (okay, he made me tear up, let's get it straight). Francesca Hayward is beautiful, almost dreamlike, the way she looks, the way she moves, the way she smiles, she's just perfect. Every little girls who's socialization was effected by Disney movies wants to grow up to be her (most of them to be grown up finally to be Rebel Wilson rather, and realize only later that it was a luckiest thing ever happened to them, but never mind). Speaking of which, the comic relief section, Rebel Wilson and James Corden were good, they had the most boring songs of them all, and made them work.
The character of Macavity was a major letdown from a writer's point of view. In the original he's not a character, just a faceless threat, so he was practically a blank page here, with the potential to be used for anything. Like, for giving the movie a plot, for a start. A sensible one, for those, who don't appreciate T.S. Eliot's poetry enough to keep them entertained for two hours. But his appearance didn't help the plot(lessness) much, because it wasn't connected in any way with Grizabella's storyline, which is, honestly, the only plotline-seed the story has. Not a very strong one, because in the end no one really understands why Old Deuteronomy chooses her. She has this immense pain in her, but humans, not being as empathetic as cats (or maybe it's just me...) prefer a reason to find the decision credible. Seriously, after watching the movie, who on Earth would give her a second chance instead of Gus, or any other contender, when her only regret seems to be that she's not young and pretty anymore? The climax of the story should be the choice itself, and the question to be answered is not why Macavity can't be chosen - it's pretty obvious from a musical's simplistic point of view - but why Grizabella is. It's stated that in the past she went with Macavity, so it was a missed opportunity, I guess it wouldn't be that hard to add a few lines, and, presto, much less one star ratings.
Other than this, Jennifer Hudson was good, maybe less close-ups would have worked better though, for some names mentioned make the comparison a bit unflattering for her. And Idris Elba... I don't know, they were able to CGI everyone else into something more or less cat-like, except for him. They kept his original skin tone (which is beautiful btw), without any patterns, which made him look nothing like any cat breed known to date, but still Idris Elba, who grew fur due to some unfortunate medical condition since the last time we saw him. The good news is, if the CGI guys ever plan to make a movie called Yetis, technology is a given.
I wonder why no one mentions Robbie Fairchild, who plays Munkustrap. The movie is mostly based on him. He's practically in each and every scene. And he's the only one in the cast who seems to believe, I mean seriously, that he's a cat, and not an actor dressed as a cat. He also has the aura of a leader, which is not easy to convey while meowing, I guess. He did a very convincing job, singing, dancing and acting.
Laurie Davidson's Mr. Mistoffelees was cute, I liked the rookie magician concept, but it was a bit overplayed, and the song itself would have worked better with more confidence maybe. Steven McRae, playing Skimbleshanks was simply impeccable. Taylor Swift was more cute than sexy, but given the PG rating it was a knowing choice maybe. The only one I felt a bit out of his depth was Jason Derulo, who simply failed to bring the star quality into his character. His singing was good, but the way he moved looked more self-conscious than badass/over the top, as if he was scared of the space given him to fill.
What really made me love the movie was the ending scene. With Judi Dench reciting The Addressing of Cats. If you ever try to break the 4th wall, break it like a boss. With someone of her quality. She made every line sound as if she made them up on the spot, which is, in case of a poem, just incredible. And with arguably the best poem of Old Possum's book (it's just an opinion, obviously, based partly on the fact that it lost some of its edge in translation to my first language, which is always the sign of being a great poem; good ones often can be translated into something equal, or even better, adding a few layers here and there). And I loved the concept so much: a cat, who is also a human, addressing humans about addressing of cats. It was a great meta moment, I really appreciated it.",Cats

Personally I really liked it, the touch of humour and new characters and songs I think helped younger audiences as the original was a little tricky to follow.

1553,Mysteriacury,Underated and Harshly criticised - A joy to watch,8,14 January 2020,"Firstly, to the random reviewer using several accounts to post several reviews each with one star, with an uncanningly similar tone for each - I see you. And if something like this causes you to lose the will to live when so many awful things going on in the world you need a reality check!Now that I got that out my system on to the movie - is it as bad as the critics said it was? No, of course not, you can't combine the music of Andrew Lloyd Webber with a cast like that and have a complete disaster. The music for those of us who grew up loving ALW's music and learning from him will appreciate the dancing, the beautiful singing, and the mastery that went in to creating something like this. It would have taken a lot of time and energy to create the sequences that, not to mention the visual artists themselves. Sure the vis-effects needed the touch up they were given, and there were still moments that might have needed fixing, but I was too captivated by the talent of the actors and the music for any of it to really bother me. The obvious shape of the cats changing, for example could have had some continuity, but as I said it didn't detract. I think also, that in a film industry that is now very dark, and genre driven a movie with innocence like this as well as the language might be lost.What Hooper's writers did well was the threaded together the story-line from the stage show to make it more cohesive, and while this was hard to follow for some, if you were paying attention to the lyrics, but I think if you don't know the stage musical or go in for an open mind then you aren't going to understand what's going on. It might have been a case of the writers simplying it without dumbing down the work of T.S. Elliot, but this was already done by ALW & co for the stage musical so what threading it together the way Hooper's team have was great - the use of Victoria the cat played by Francesca Hayward as we learn about the Jellicles through her eyes was great. The new song introduced fitted in seamlessly, and I thoroughly enjoyed the ride. With Judi Dench as Old Deuteronomy you can't go wrong even tho this breaks tradition. I loved Laurie Davidson's interpretation of Mr Mistoffelees as well - he's said to be shy in the poem and Davidson's cat was very endearing.I'd see it again on the big screen - and I fully encourage you to watch this if you are a fan of Andrew Lloyd Webber's musicals go and see it for yourself and don't let it's awful reviews put you off. This is a masterpiece in it's own way despite it's flaws. Go with an open mind.",Cats

1555,elinannalinnea,"Guys, why so negative?",9,17 January 2020,"I had very low expectations when going due to the reviews, but since I'm a musical theatre nerd I wanted to see and judge with my own two eyes. To begin with, I absolutely adore the on-stage musical, and I really enjoyed this film as well. I can see how some people might find the CGI-design a bit strange, but I thought they were very cute to look at. I especially felt my heart melt a little bit every time I saw Mr. Mistoffelees. So cute and adorable. Yes, there are som mistakes in the CGI, like collars not connected to a cat, floating feet etc, but that's basically the only reason I give it a 9/10 and not the full jackpot. It was also pretty... strange when Macavity ""flashed"" in one scene, and then looked naked in another scene (due to his very short fur). Other than that, the film really captures the musical, and I LOVED that they added in Victorias storyline, since it gave the film a bit more structure than the original show (the show can be a bit confusing). And that they gave Mr. Mistoffelees a bit more storyline as well, since he's (obviously) my favourite cat (was in the musical as well). So don't listen so much to the negative reviews, go and see what YOU think!",Cats
1556,oleksiy-96336,"Cheap, discriminatory, and flashy movie",2,18 January 2020,"This is supposed to be a piece of entertainment, and it kind of is, there are some nice songs and nice dance scenes there. However, the message that this movie sends is unacceptable. First of all, I cannot see much artistic message in it. But secondly, and most importantly, it's very discriminatory. Why is Macavity black? So we have basically every other actor in the movie white except the villain Macavity, and the rather weak and troubled Grizabella, who just seeks acceptance of others, and who needs to be saved. That's a racist message. It's racism at the subconscious level, sort of portraying it as if the things are ""normal"" that way. And then on top of that, look at how Jennyanydots is portrayed. They are simply making fun of her and showing her as clumsy because she's overweight. So it's immediately stereotyping and making fun of overweight people, which is unacceptable",Cats

1558,bhollera-37061,A Work of Art with Poor Source Material,6,19 January 2020,"If you like Cats the Musical, you should love this 2019 movie adaptation. The entire production team, along with many actors, should be nominated for every award possible for their work in developing poor source material into an entertaining and visually stunning film. Basically, this musical is based off children's poems with no real purpose or theme. While that can still work if each individual part is fun and exciting, the creators of this musical failed to do even that.First, let's get my thoughts on the source material out of the way. The goal of every cat is to be chosen for ascension to the Heaviside Layer (their version of heaven) and rebirth. That alone is messed up as one should want to live their life instead of ending it and moving on to the next one, though I suppose cats have nine lives and think a bit differently. Looking at a few examples really make me question this theme, especially whether such a theme is appropriate for a supposed ""family friendly"" musical. When Jennyanydots is asked why she wants another life she responds, ""I can't keep being in this kitchen."" Bustopher Jones, self-admittedly an overweight cat, supposedly wants a new life as a way of losing weight. Grizabella, once a happy and beautiful cat, is now disgraced, shunned, and bullied by the other Jellicle cats and is looking to be reborn to escape her current situation. Even with the understanding that ascension to the Heaviside Layer is seen as a religious experience, and therefore something to strive for, these are absolutely terrible reasons for wanting to die and start a new life. To make matters worse, many of the songs are poorly written and are far too repetitive. The fact that a musical with such ridiculous lyrics has had so much success astounds me. The first song alone has thirty-four lines that each contain the word ""Jellicle"" twice! Having to hear that word sixty-eight times in a four minute span, at the very beginning of the movie no less, really ruined it for me which is a pretty big deal considering they continue to use that word often throughout the musical. Speaking of which, Jellicle is supposedly a corruption of ""dear little cats"" which should really tell you all you need to know about how little this musical makes sense.With that said, I now want to discuss how this adaptation of Cats succeeds in spite of the source material. Considering that Cats is a musical with very few speaking lines, the acting was excellent. With actors such as Judi Dench, Ian McKellen, and Idris Elba as part of the cast that should be expected, but it is important to note that they did not disappoint in limited roles. In particular, Elba really exceeded my expectations as the villainous Macavity with just the right amounts of menace and charisma. James Corden turned in a solid comedic performance, but Rebel Wilson stole the show when it came to humor. Wilson perfectly balanced her role as a lazy cat who was trying to prove she had a purpose as well, and also had great lines such as accusing the Rum Tum Tugger (Jason Derulo) of ""milking it"" during his performance and her insistence that she could dance like Derulo (and then attempting to do so). Her best joke of all was asking if Rum Tum Tugger was neutered as Derulo was hitting the high notes. Likely overlooked by most viewers, this joke was particularly hilarious to me as Derulo has confirmed that the producers used CGI to remove the bulge of his large package. Jennifer Hudson, Francesca Hayward, and Laurie Davidson were also wonderful in their roles as Grizabella, Victoria, and Mr. Mistoffelees, respectively.More important than the acting in a musical, the entire cast turned in excellent vocal performances, with the notable exception of Taylor Swift. While Swift did very well during the powerful moments of her song, it's the softer moments where her attempt at a light British accent was both inconsistent and poorly done which really ruined it for me. Her one speaking line was delivered flawlessly, though! Hudson delivered an amazing performance every time she was on the screen, both as an actor and singer. It was absolutely incredible to hear the emotion in her voice while also seeing that same emotion perfectly reflected on the face of a cat. Hayward was also remarkable and I consistently found myself wanting her to be involved in more songs considering she was in almost every scene. Hayward's performance of Beautiful Ghosts was wonderful, as was her acting with Hudson during the song. The lyrics and facial expressions really made me believe that they were forming an emotional connection, which is pretty cool to say about two CGI cats. Corden and Wilson, both great in their aforementioned comedic roles, also gave impressive vocal performances. Dench, cast in the original London production of Cats before dropping out due to injury, was given the worst song of the entire film, but somehow still sang well. One of my favorite performances was Gus the Theatre Cat, with McKellen an absolutely perfect fit for the role.I also want to give credit to the one aspect of the story line that actually made sense to me. The love that develops between Victoria and Mr. Mistoffelees seemed innocent and real, and both actors really sold it with their performances. Victoria is very naïve throughout the film, especially when she just goes along on a crime spree with Mungojerrie and Rumpleteazer without any hesitation, but she quickly realizes that Mr. Mistoffelees cares for her and is a cat with good intentions. Meanwhile, Mr. Mistoffelees is smitten the very first time he sees Victoria and even though some may say his actions were more like those of a stalker than a lover, his personality is so innocent and pure that I found it endearing to watch him look out for Victoria as she was introduced to and overwhelmed by the world of Jellicle cats. My favorite part of their story was when Mr. Mistoffelees attempted to bring Old Deuteronomy back from the clutches of Macavity. After several failed attempts, when all of the other Jellicle cats and Mr. Mistoffelees himself seemed to have given up, Victoria alone expresses her belief in Mr. Mistoffelees which is all he needs to successfully perform his magic. The look of love between them when they rub their heads together in celebration of his success is absolutely the most heartwarming moment of the entire film.Overall, I found Cats to be very entertaining thanks to the excellent acting, singing, choreography, and visual effects. This film proves that when all of those aspects work well together, poor lyrics, generally the most important part of a musical, and an underwhelming story line can be overcome. Coming from someone who hasn't seen any other version of Cats, this is by far the best adaptation yet!",Cats

1563,thethplanet-70439,"Perhaps the most entertaining of all stage musicals, now in its filmed version.",10,12 February 2020,"I have long enjoyed the musical 'Cats', both in several attendances at live productions and simply listening to the music on CD. 'Cats', the movie, was created in 1997, a full 16 years after its debut on stage. This isn't simply the taping of a stage performance. For the movie they assembled the best cast they could from among 'Cats' stage veterans. The set was designed especially for the movie, the makeup was toned down to look better in the closer perspective of the movie, especially the close-ups, a full orchestra was used, songs were recorded in a studio, and conventional movie techniques were used for the filming -- multiple angles, close-ups, cameras moving on tracks, etc. What we get is a movie that is does not have the realism of a stage production, and it is fairly obvious most times that singers are lip-syncing their own recordings, but a movie nonetheless that is a superb supplement to the live performances. The DVD has a very nice 'making-of' special, we see Andrew Lloyd Weber personally supervising the musical numbers, we see some of the makeup artistry at work, and a few before/after shots of actors and their characters.Overall a fine DVD of a superb movie of perhaps the most entertaining stage musical of all.",Cats

""A tribe of cats must decide yearly which one will ascend to the Heaviside Layer and be reincarnated into a new life.""
Now ill tell you what I thought it was about.
A old cat acts all wise and tells a couple of other cats that she will reincarnate them into a new life when really she probably kills them for her own enjoyment.
Now onto other problems with the movie. The actors look gross as cats human hybrid and absolutely no-one wants to see a cat Rebel Wilson stripping and taking her clothes off when really its cat fur.

I saw the original stage version in London, which was great, and this film compares very well with that, although I will concede that it gets off to a slow start, but when the big numbers come thick and fast during the second half I was not only touched by some of the performances but genuinely impressed with what these fine actors could achieve despite the heavy make-up.
The sensuality of their movements and dancing seemed most convincing, and Mr Mistopheles in particular impressed me. Judy Dench not so much - a rather wooden performance.

The fact of the matter is that CATS doesn't have much plot, that's why it makes a great musical. Not a cinematic experience. The fact that with so little to strive to get right they still managed to mess up almost EVERYTHING that makes this musical magical.
I'm sorry, but BOMBALURINA working for Macavity???? Nope. A timid and shy Mistoffelees.. maybe, but no not really. Do not get me started on Jennyanydots. Rum Tum Tugger? Uhg. Poor Bustopher Jones as well. The mischaracterization of the cats themselves makes me want to puke. Not even getting into the nightmare fuel that is the CGI in this movie.

I took meds, I snorted curry, but nothing would stop it. Then the trailer dropped. It was like the clouds parted. Seeing James Corden as a cat was all I needed. In the days to come, I looped the trailer over and over. I couldn't get enough. When the movie came out, I bought the first ticket, trampled a girl to get in, and sat in the first row. And all my sadness dissipated. It was beautiful. In that moment I had an out of body experience. Seeing Judy Dench lick her leg and watching Taylor Swift being slightly less annoying than usual all combined with James Corden was too much.
I got home that night and threw out all my meds and curry. I didn't need them anymore. Since then I have devoted myself to watching the movie five times a day while sitting on my head. I am the proud owner of so many cats, I lost count. My neighbors think me strange and Dad said something about disowning me, but it matters not. I have all I need. I no longer shower so I can make time for this glorious masterpiece. The sight of Jason Derulo crawling around alone is enough to wash my body clean enough for years.

On a serious note, with that budget my dog could have genetically engineered singing and dancing cats more entertaining. The songs were soul crushing. How many times can you fit Jellicle in a freaking minute? I was looking so hard for a plot I think I just imagined my own. Why close up on terrible CGI.? Why?? They all look like they put their heads in a slice of bread, shrieked their lines then created the CGI and set AROUND IT - with the worst resources ever. The main cat had this dumb bewildered look on her face the whole time I wanted to smack off like...get a clue. Vocal talent was where?

That's it.

1586,RobinTMP,"Not at ALL the dumpster fire I expected...did we see the same movie, or what?",8,29 December 2019,"So I went to this with a friend, both of us expecting to MST3K our way through the whole thing; the previous day, the theatre's manager was confronted by an elderly woman who was irate because the rest of the scanty audience had been doing exactly that, and she wanted a pass for a future date as a result. Needless to say, my hopes were on the seriously low end, and I was pretty much expecting a complete dumpster fire of a film. BUT......what do you know? It actually turned out to be surprisingly GOOD! Yes, I was totally sober throughout, and am more than familiar with both good and bad films in such as a way as to be able to tell one from another, and I""m telling you, CATS was actually pretty damn good! Yes, seeing CGI fur on human beings definitely takes some time getting used to (although it was the tails and ears that made me twitch more than the fur itself), but I *did* get used to it surprisingly quickly. Part of my brain kept wondering ""Is *this* where it all goes to hell?"", but no, that never happened --it just kept on going its merry way, taking me and my friend (who agrees with me, but doesn't spend much time on IMDB) with it.More specific comments:
The acting: Everyone did a perfectly respectable job with their characters; Francesca Heyward was a most charming and sweet-natured ingenue, Idris Elba was wonderfully fiendish as McCavity, and, of course, Dame Judi and Sir Ian were terrific. (I definitely noticed that Old Deuteronomy's fur and ensemble bore a most striking resemblance to Queen Elizabeth in Shakespeare in Love, which I'm sure was totally intentional, and I'm reasonably sure I've seen Gus's ""human"" in a similar outfit for a different role as well.) My only real complaint--and it's certainly not her fault--was with Jennifer Hudson's Grizabella having a perpetually runny nose--we know she's supposed to be a wretched outcast, so the teary eyes are quite appropriate, but did she *have* to have a snotty nose throughout? (It made me want to offer the poor cat a tissue for mop-up; Tom Hooper, could you do *something* about that when you inevitably tweak it all again?) The singing and dancing was all on point, even with the actors who weren't from a musical background, with the talking/singing of several performers coming off just fine. (Believe me, I've seen in done in ways that made me cringe--hello, Rex Harrison in My Fair Lady!--but this wasn't one of them.) Yes, I even liked Rebel Wilson, who seems to be getting a lot of grief as Jennyanydots--as a cat person, I've *known* cats just like that, rolling and lolling and lounging and looking totally obscene in the way that only a large, spoiled cat can, and the only reason they don't pick up prey daintily with their fingers is because they literally can't--if they *could*, then they *would*!.Pretty much everything else: The set design was wonderful--yes, I noticed all the sneaky little cat-related signs and business names, and I'm sure Bast, wherever she may be, is pleased that the theatre was named The Egyptian--and the scale of the set and props re: the performers seemed just about right. I personally didn't happen to notice any serious CGI glitches (there probably were some, but I must have missed them; as for Dame Judy's hand, *all* of the cats had hands rather than paws, so what was the problem with that?), and the lighting fit perfectly, especially that lovely sunrise at the end. Oh, and the musical arrangements were another aspect I'd heard complaints about, but I thought they complimented the songs very well. Oh, what the hell...I even cried during the whole ""Memory"" sequence, and I'm not usually one who cries at movies. *sniff* Finally, the pace moves along quickly and without dragging, and the two hours practically flew by; I daresay there are a number of other films who could use this as an example of what and what not to do in that regard.TL;DR: I really, really ended up liking the movie, and am seriously inclined to go back to the theatre and see it again, bringing along someone who's heard and only expects the worst, and hopefully converting them, since I do so love to proselytize...won't you come along?Note: No, I've never seen the stage show, so I was a total CATS virgin; I am, however, someone who's enjoyed musicals their entire life, and has lived with *real* cats for many years, so I like to think I have some understanding of both that I was able to use while writing this review.",Cats

1606,jcruztheandonly,12 Out of 10,10,10 September 2020,"The movie Cats was a great time! Some disclosures: Firstly, I don't watch or enjoy musicals or theater, so I've never seen the show. Second, I smoked a heroic amount of pot before and while watching it. Lastly, my fiancé hated it. She glared at me the entire time for subjecting her to this...film(?)I have NEVER laughed so hard for so long in my entire life. I don't understand it at all! The songs are garbage, there is no character development, its plot is absolute nonsense, and the visual effects are laughably terrible. You would think this makes it a bad movie. But I've seen bad movies. One forgets bad movies. This movie will stay with me long after I've forgotten the names and faces of people I've known. This movie lives in my soul now.Here's what this movie has that no bad movie has ever had: Sir Ian McKellen lapping milk from a bowl. Dame Judi Dench wearing either a coat of her own fur or just another, similarly colored cat's fur. (Incidentally, does anyone else notice that she bears a strong resemblance to Jon Voight?) Stringer Bell as Pimpy McKitty. Mice with childrens' faces pasted on using MS Paint. Women dressed up as cockroaches (not a real word according to my Swipe dictionary apparently) being casually eaten. James Cordon as a tuxedo-colored cat inexplicably also wearing a tuxedo. Jason Derulo trying with every ounce of his being not to say his own name. I liked Taylor Swift as a cat for reasons I can't mention in mixed company. Actual cat magic. I was blown away when it pulled a 'Now You See Me' and stage magic became actual Dr. Strange magic.
There were also fifteen introductions of cat-people with a wildly varying amount of skill dedicated to each cat's rendering based on what I'm guessing was a balance between how important they were to the movie and how famous the actor portraying them was. This let you immediately know who matters and who was just some extra with mascara whiskers painted over mime-face.I laughed until I cried. My face and throat hurt from laughing for so long. It has permanently affected my status among my friends, who no longer trust my recommendations. Telling my friends to watch this movie has damaged my credibility. I will not stop.

Cats has the same problem as the movie adaptation of Les Miz. Trying to make a sensible plot from musicals that are primarily song (Les Miz) and dance (Cats). Trying to bring in big names who can't sing or dance and give them screen time at the expense of what has made these great musicals.

The singing, which this film relied upon heavily was extremely dodgy (except j-hud her vocals were great). There were absurd storylines added in that were different from the stage musical; mainly that macavaity magically steals cats and holds them prisoner on a boat on the River Thames and even tries to make one cat walk the plank - I mean really you try and add in a story and that is the best that can be done???The stage show is up-lifting and this was beyond dreary it was so tough to stick it out to the end when it was finished I just felt so relieved it was over, a feeling echoed by my mum and sister.

I think the point that we are currently in as far as CGI goes is that the technology has advanced to the point where it's the most sensible, spectacular choice, but not far enough to surpass the threshold of the uncanny valley. And this movie is really, really uncanny. With every scene, the creeping impulse that makes you scream ""WHY?"" is compounded with every visual, every proportional disruption, every lapse in CGI artistry. If you were stand in packed auditorium, and everyone were to start yelling, an effect that overloads your senses, at some point you would revert to a fight-or-flight impulse, and that is what this movie did to me. Despite being at home, I had the urge to claw through my chair's plastic armrest through the film. I couldn't process so much chaos into meaning.The shame is that this movie could have been saved through retreating from the impulse of virtual effects, back to a more acceptable visual of actors dressed in cat costumes. The movie might be mediocre, but there's no quality assessment that can be processed beyond the visual terror of cats with human faces, human hands, human feet, and human clothes. Horrifying.",Cats

If you don't like the theatrical version and have never read the poems, then you probably won't like it. If you know and like both, then you'll appreciate the movie. It could've been better, especially with more dancing, but the music stays true to the Broadway and West End classic, and the newly injected plot is a nice and slightly cohesive add.

Having seen the original stage show run in Sydney when in high school, Cats has always been a favourite and I was genuinely fearful of how it would transition to the big screen given such bad publicity and ratings. But, I was pleasantly surprised. From watching the trailer, the movie was all I expected and more. Yes there are cheesy parts, but the one liners actually make it better. The sets are really well done. The choreography is excellent. The music is brilliant. To those saying that there is no storyline, you were obviously watching something else and got the two mixed up.Here is a tip. Watch the trailers. If they creep you out - don't watch it!!! Simple!!!

1655,chaosone,"This film has no bad reviews, only bad reviewers",10,27 December 2020,"The negative reviewers either want to ""fit in"" with the narrative, or have a narrow imagination (or are the much rarer statistically expected genuine negative reviewers). I don't doubt that the majority of them watched (if they even bothered going that far) for the sole reason of leaving a negative review.I get it, musicals translated to film aren't for everyone - but you more-or-less know what you're getting in to on that one. Once you're self aware enough to realise this isn't a sci-fi fantasy or crime thriller, and is about the story of some cats, you'll be well on your way to enjoying this film more. The hilarious number of negative reviews that are basically ""oh my god, there are CGI cats in this movie!"" - I dunno, maybe at least give the title of films you're going to watch a read through - seriously, it's four letters, you managed to bung together a couple of sentences for a disingenuous one-star review, yet still somehow, amazingly, failed to take account that you were watching a film called ""Cats"". It's just lazy to write a negative review saying the ""storyline had no structure"" when you're so dazzled to distraction by CGI cats that you fail to understand what must be one of the more obvious storylines in a musical (although it does require you to listen to the lyrics and actually pay attention to the film).It's important to understand the above in consideration of the reviews, because, all told, this is a relatively charming and certainly quite faithful recreation of the stage show (to those unaware, it's a phenomenally successful theatre show running for decades to packed and satisfied audiences).To set some context, I am a big fan of the musical and have seen it a few times in the West End, along with the filmed stage recording. And, if you're at all like me, and are slightly scared of watching this film for fear of ruining your enjoyment of the musical itself - watch it. It's not ""just"" not bad, it's pretty good.It's visually pleasing with its twilight neon-lit cobbled street settings, albeit somewhat more desaturated to a comparable predecessor such as Moulin Rouge. It's absolutely packed with well known actors - who I am sure all signed up due to a love of the musical. Not a reason to like the film by itself, but taken at face value each of their performances feels like they've poured their soul into it. It can be nothing short of heartbreaking to have what is clearly a labour of love to be destroyed by the whims of people too easily influenced by right-think. I would concur with the film's major disappointment being the rendition of ""Memory"" given to us, but all told it had a lot to live up to.In short: watch it, especially if you get it included with whatever you're already subscribed to - that's what I did. I just hope that it really does enjoy some success in the future when a generation of more independent thinkers emerges, and takes a film called ""Cats"" at face value and opens their imagination enough to accept that the film might just feature, yes: cats.",Cats

Go into it expecting an old-time singing and dancing musical, A new song and character have been added, and a little more story is included compared to the stage versions I saw. The dancing is wonderful. Francesca Hayward, is a joy to watch. For you tap fans, there is a glorious tap number to savor. Most of the singing is beautiful, and the other singing fits the character. There are even a few times when your heart/soul will be touched. It is not a perfect film. The editing/direction are not always helpful and some characters get more screen time then needed (Rebel Wilson does her typical over acting look at me routine). The negative reviews seem to focus on the thin plot and ""creepy"" looking cats. The plot of any song and dance movie/show is not designed to be complicated, it's designed to showcase the singing and dancing, which this plot actually does better than the stage versions I saw. The stage versions also had people dressed in cat costumes with cat ears and tails and makeup versions of cat faces and I never once saw a review that they were ""creepy"". The haters just seem to have no whimsy, wonder or serenity to allow themselves to just enjoy a movie because its fun. So, if you ever enjoyed seeing the stage version of Cats (or wished you had seen it and never did), like singing and dancing, or need a break from superheroes, science fiction and sequels, take friends and loved ones to see Cats.

Every song is delivered with excellence by some of the world's most well-known artists. There are comical twists and turns but I found myself indulging in every single song.As for the story - this musical follows a very simple, linear narrative - a newly stray cat walks central London as she is introduced to a whole host of new cats. Each cat character has it's own musical performance. It's in keeping with the original theatre version. I found the linear movement from one cat to the next worked in the films favour - focusing on the music without trying to invent any kind of elaborate story line. It truely is a beautiful musical.As a piece of entertainment, if you like musicals then you will love and quite possibly be overwhelmed by the musical magic offered here. If you don't like musical theatre then Cats has little to offer you. This is where critics have stepped low with ratings: rating Cats as a story for the masses - rather than as the simple musical it aims to be.",Cats

1666,stivo81,"Oh, it's bad, but it's so much fun to watch!",7,20 December 2019,"I've seen the stage musical and it's one of the worst out there; it's built around one great song, Memory, and that's all it has going for it. I had no expectation that the film would be better, but was instantly intrigued when the first images came to light. The translation wasn't at all what I expected, but I was ready to take a trip to that uncanny valley.Now, having seen it, it's quite the spectacle, and not in the way it's intended to be. The CGI is all over the place and it's astounding that they released it in the shape it's in. Faces move, but heads don't move accordingly; bodies look like they're floating, with the feet so manipulated by the effects they don't actually look like they're touching the ground; bodies look distorted to the point that their movements look artificial, when so much effort was put into the choreography. The problems are just so evident.Yet, while watching this chaotic mess of a film, I found myself enjoying every moment. It's like a game, where you start looking for what's wrong in each frame, and there's plenty to uncover. Sure, the cast looks like they're having a decent time, but wondering why none of them thought twice about this being a disaster also supplies some sort of excitement, because it's the kind of bad that is actually fun to experience. I'm glad this exists. It's full of wonder and mania, fluctuating between terror, confusion, and amazement, often in one fell swoop.Embrace the curiosity, grab a drink or four beforehand, and just succumb to this marvelous piece of eventual cult cinema that will be giffed for decades to come. If anything's certain, you've never seen anything like this before and it's hard to imagine anything else coming close to it anytime soon.",Cats
1667,dracuul78,Beautiful rendition of the musical,8,31 December 2019,"After having seen all the negative reviews I was expecting the worst, but really came back pleasantly surprised.Ok, let's be honest, it wasn't perfect...
With actress Rebel Wilson you can expect some slapstick kind of jokes a-la Pitch Perfect, which sometimes feel out of place. I found it hard to adjust to Old Deuteronomy being an old lady instead of the baritone voice. Some of the CGI was not very convincing, but nothing too distracting. Lastly, I could mention that some of the camera shots were a bit static and boring...Besides that, I think this is a beautiful rendition of the musical Cats, with all the music of Andrew Lloyd Webber in excellent quality, good singing, impressive dancing. Breaking away from the theater stage restrictions allowed for some more freedom in scenery, story-telling and special effects, such as the twitching cat ears and tails.If you've ever seen the musical this will be a wonderful opportunity to relive the memories, perhaps - like me - wipe a tear during the impressive performance of Memory.... and you're already familiar with the (admittedly) somewhat strange story.",Cats
1668,witchnicky-1,Probably needs to be watched with the right mindset,7,11 April 2020,"If you've seen the Broadway show, you should be prepared by the cats' looks: the performers are constantly in your face in the theater, wherever you're sitting. If you can buy that live, you can buy it on video.
Also, I really don't see how people would be unprepared for this to be a full on musical performance. I was surprised by the DIALOGUE: people complaining that they sing all the time, well... duh. That's the whole point. Same goes for the very flimsy plot, as there's actually none. The movie tried to pad it a bit in a way that made very little sense, but the original content was fine as it was. If you want to turn CATS into a movie, that's what you're getting: people pretending to be cats, singing and dancing. It's been more than enough for decades on Broadway and the West End, after all. The only twist that I enjoyed was the fact that they used Victoria as a stand-in for the public, as it made the performance more cohesive.All in all, as a fan of the show, I really enjoyed this. Far more than I expected. The first half hour strikes some bad cords with a lot of weird choices in sound editing and a really awful rendition of Jennyanydots.  I'm not a fan of Rebel Wilson or her typecasting and this was definitely no exception. Horrible. Horrible. Horrible. Thankfully, she's the first to disappear and I'm suddenly #TeamMacavity for that.
From James Corden on, the movie gets very much back on track with the show, and it's quite a jolly ride. The multiple backgrounds besides the street and the theater don't really work, as the different proportions of humans vs. cats are made glaringly obvious when the characters interact with forniture and trash cans, but that's about my major gripe besides Rebel Wilson. ""Macavity"" is probably one of the best songs and I only realized Bombalurina was Taylor Swift when reading reviews... very sorry for whoever went to the movies for her: great performance, but fans should have done their homework and realize one song was all she got.
Dame Judi Dench was, of course, spectacular as usual. I believe she should be cast in ALL menthor/community leader/ultimate boss type of roles, whatever their previous gender. Hell, if they remake Harry Potter in her lifetime, give her Dumbledore, too!!I'm sold, actually.But that's probably because I love the show. I know some Broadway fans were underwhelmed by all the changes and that's ok: like books-to-movies, there's bound to be some nitpicking if you're a fan. Unfortunately, I believe that the majority of bad reviews come from people who wouldn't have been the intended audience for the musical and are, therefore, the wrong audience for the movie. Unfortunately, movies are more widespread than Broadway shows, so there'll be a huge chunk of moviegoers who won't be interested.",Cats
1669,k_busch87,Not at all as bad as people say!,6,29 June 2020,"I have a theory that the rating is this low because all the fans of the musical are upset that it's not true to the original.. which is ironic, cause they tried to make a storyline to make it easier to understand. However, this is a musical with absolutely no storyline, so non-musical people hate it because of the lack of a storyline :') So no one really likes it I guess..!?
That said, I think they did a decent job creating a story to follow, and added a bit of humour. I don't hate it. Singing was fine.. I could have done with a bit more dancing, but I'm not mad about it. And the cgi isn't as bad as people are trying to make it!? Maybe I've seen the edited version, I don't know. In that case, its not as bad as it was I guess :)So if you like musicals, and isn't a hardcore fan of Cats who can't stand a bit of change, this is not a bad movie :)

I saw Cats in London twice in the eighties and listened to the soundtrack through my childhood. It is probably my favourite musical and the big screen version does justice to my memories of the original stage performance. Sure, there are a few issues, but there are in most films. If you are prepared to suspend your disbelief and go with the world of the film then you will enjoy it.

1673,chaz_and_meh,You either Like it or Hate it,7,13 February 2021,"The same can be said for the Broadway stage production of Cats. People either like it or can't understand it & dismiss it as trash. But that is how all art is. One person looks at a painting on a wall worth thousands of dollars, where the artist literally just took a brush & flung paint randomly onto the canvas in nonsensical patterns & calls it 'modern art' & someone else looks at it & says, ""my toddler could have done better for free."" Everyone is entitled to their opinion but it may be helpful to know where people are coming from to see the bias of their opinion.Someone who has never seen the stage production, probably won't like this at all, even though the movie has more (believe it or not) story & plot than the stage version. Also people who don't like musicals or are used to people singing dialogue, instead of just saying it, probably won't enjoy this movie either. People who don't see ""art"" in bizarre poetry with nonsensical words, probably won''t understand either the play or movie & get frustrated & angry because they don't know what is going on & people don't like to feel stupid, so they will blame the art itself for not spoon-feeding them everything. People who don't like dancing probably won't enjoy Cats either because most of the show is dancing. People of the lowest common denominator who are looking for explosions or quick 1-liner jokes every 2 seconds or some complicated hidden plot twist, have no business watching Cats. People who expect every song to be top a 40 hit will not like Cats either because again, the songs are meant to express the dialogue, not end up on the radio. Most musicals have 1 or 2 (maybe 3 if they are lucky) memorable songs that could be radio-worthy & for Cats, the only song of that caliber is ""Memory."" But even for an epic song that good, it doesn't have as big of an impact if the context is lost on most of the audience. It is hard to ""feel"" for the characters if their backstory is not shown/demonstrated/explained in detail. A couple lines of exposition that are easily missed if not paying close attention is not enough to make a character ""likeable"" or ""relatable"" to modern audiences.Also, if a character is supposed to be an old destitute homeless bum with nothing, they should look like one. Other than a scar by her eye & some not 'purrfect' fur, Grizabella looked fine & quite beautiful. It is harder to feel empathy & sad for someone if they don't look like they should have much to be sad about. In spite of that I think Jennifer Hudson was amazing in her acting in her face & her eyes. It is only because of her looks of cautious surprise & ""I'm not sure if you're going to hurt me"" expressions when Victoria attempted to befriend her that made me feel anything for Grizabella at all. She totally encapsulated the look of someone who is familiar with being hurt, abused, & betrayed throughout her life. In her song, she mentions the memories of her past, yet we know virtually nothing about her past other than she used to be a glamour cat & was with Macavity at one point. And that is all. But in spite of that her version of ""Memory"" still blew me away & is my favorite version of the song ever. Some people have complained that the fact that her nose was running because she was crying while she was singing was distracting to them. What? If an old homeless hag was singing about their terrible life, you think they would be smiling? Laughing? No, they would be sobbing, uncontrollably, just like Jennifer Hudson was. She didn't just sing the song so it could be technically perfect, she 'lived' the song fully by putting herself into the character she was playing. Does seeing emotion like that make you uncomfortable? Was that too raw for you? When you see a homeless person on the corner, do you look the other way? Sorry, not everything is sunshine & rainbows & happy endings all the time. Life sucks for most people most of the time with a few bright spots along the way. That's reality. And even though this musical is obviously a fantasy, making it somewhat realistic & relatable is what art is about. It is about having an experience where you hopefully feel something & are changed as a result. But again art is not for everyone.Is this movie 'purrfect'? Absolutely not. Could it have been better? Totally, in a bunch of ways that have already been related in detail by other reviewers. Were there some cringe-worthy scenes? 100% for sure in the Gumby-cat & Glutton-cat songs. Is it the worst movie of all time? Not in the least, unless you are one of the people mentioned above that really should stick to the cookie-cutter Hollywood movies that you are used to. No offense, really. People like what they like & don't have to like everything that someone else likes. I actually really enjoyed many of the other comments & lol at the creativity of expression in how seeing this movie somehow destroyed their lives. They deserve some credit & props for their gift with humorous words. :-)Any time something is adapted from one art medium to another there are going to be purists that want things to be the same & any changes are an offense. If everything was going to be exactly the same, what would be the point of making it again? But by changing things, it gives a chance for a different interpretation & maybe even a modernization. A lot of people seem to have issues with the motion-capture & the CGI cat fur not passing the 'uncanny valley' threshold & I can see their point but I find the movie version much more enjoyable than the stage production's terribly gaudy makeup & over-the-top costumes, but that is just my opinion. I know some really like the crazy costume design of the Broadway shows. To each their own, I guess. In the movie, you can almost believe that they are some sort of cat, albeit a fantasy cat, since your pet cat at home probably doesn't talk, sing or dance, or have a human face, hands, & feet.Some have suggested that the CGI should have just been full 100% cat, but then you lose the important emotional performance that is in the actor's/actresses' face & eyes. The face & eyes are really the window to the soul in conveying the emotion of the story & what you are trying to portray. Using motion capture & CGI helps to not lose that part of the performance. If seeing a human face on a cat body disturbs someone then maybe more practice with using one's imagination might be in order. Some people were bothered by lackluster singing by some of the characters & I can see their point since this is a musical. Being a good singer is 'typically' part of getting a job in a musical. But if the artist is interested in making something 'not typical' that seems a little more realistic than a world where every single individual is a perfect singer & nobody ever sings off key, then they might make a musical where some are more talented with dancing (or something else) instead of singing 'purrfectly'.Could they have made a different version of this that was dumbed down & Americanized so that a wider audience could have enjoyed it & understood it more? Absolutely, but they seemed to want to stay quite close to the British stage version so that this would still be similar enough for those familiar with it & yet different enough so they could make this version their own interpretation.So in summary, I would only recommend this to those who are theater-inclined or those who enjoy art & are not looking for 'purrfection' or an exact reiteration of the Broadway show. And to be honest, even though I enjoyed the movie as a whole, there are parts that I did not like. The best part, in my opinion, is from 1:25:08 - 1:36:55 & is the only part that I have re-watched many times. Full disclosure: I actually have never seen the Broadway show in its entirety, but I do enjoy theatre generally, even though it is not as widely available here in the USA as it is in England. I also enjoy some art & educated & cultured activities including musicals & dancing with Les Miserables probably being my most favorite & have not found a version (stage or film) I do not enjoy, including Mr Hooper's version, with the live singing. To me it made it more realistic & emotionally raw & compelling.",Cats
1674,TattooedKissi,Please use an imagination when watching this,10,20 April 2020,I loved how they gave such a different story line. There is so much imagination to this. The music was beautiful and so what about cgi. This was so true. And beautiful.,Cats
1675,kl180391,Give it some credit,6,31 December 2019,"I saw the IMDb score and some reviews before heading into the theater for the new ""Cats"".
I had great hope while I know Tom Hooper is directing this great musical, as he did an absolutely amazing job for ""Les Miserables"". Therefore I was so shocked that the score for this movie is way lower than I expected which I started to think is this really the ""Cats"" or another type of ""Scary Movie"" which we all know it sucks terribly.
Screw it! I ignore all those critics and scores like I previously do for all movies. And I must say you all should give some credit to this movie.
I must admit the CG in the movies sucks terribly, totally ruin the whole movie, which I will score 0 on this category.
And 0 for the ending part which makes absolutely no sense.
And 0 for Taylor Swift even I was a fan for Taylor before.
For choice of characters, it is alright... except Ian Mckellen who can't say nor express the real emotions of the role. Which I related to Pierce Brosnan in Mamma Mia somehow.
But I do think the movie is directed in a way which allows audience to immerse themselves step by step, cat by cat. And I am so touched by the part where they sang ""Mr Mistofelees"". Real emotions, real touching. And followed by the re-entrance of Jennifer Hudson.
That's why I rate it for a 6.",Cats

While Cats was by no means perfect it was by definitely enjoyable.I assume that the reviews are either from Taylor Swift stans disappointed by her 5 minute cameo or from people that expected this to be similar to a Disney live action remake!The dancing was beautiful and the singing, especially Jennifer Hudson's version of ""Memories"", was spectacular.

The story wasn't perfect but honestly, I had a good time watching it. There were parts that were unsettling to look at, very uncomfortable and had me saying ""is this really happening right now?"" And it was, oh believe me it was. But as long as you don't take it seriously, it's kinda cute. Like seeing an animal so ugly, it starts to look cute.It's not great, no no no.

It took me a while to decide to watch the movie. I already knew before that this was not good. But it's like emptying a litter box, it has to be done. In addition, the film had an impressive cast.The plot is a bit confusing and meager. An abandoned cat is joined by a group of cats who are preparing for a talent show... for cats. The judge (played by Judi Dench) decides who gets to go to the cat heaven (Heaviside Layer). In fact, the film is mostly a presentation of all the characters and their ""talents"". Even though the film is bad, it is still not a disaster as many claim, though not far from it. I appreciated the cinematography, the sets and the lighting and the color scheme. It looked much like an advanced musical in theater and not a typical Hollywood movie. But that's where everything that was okay ends. The effects, the plot, the script, the dialogues, yes everything else is really lousy. Pretty close to a cat-astrophe. Yet, this movie will go down in history, but not in a good way.",Cats

Jennifer Hudson as Grizabella was a touching performance, as was Dame Judi Dench as Deuteronomy . Taylor Swift's contribution was lovely as well. Not that the film was prefect. McCavity and Growltiger didn't work for me. This film merits being compared to the stage musical and not being compared to other film genres .",Cats

Be a movie based on Cats.I think many that does not like the movie does not like, or if they haven't seen it, would not like, the original musical.It definitely has plenty of flaws, but in the end I enjoyed it and I did not expect to.I think it's more a matter of being very niche than being bad, even though it certainly isn't great either.So if someone thinks the movie seems interesting but are hesitant to see it, consider giving it a shot, you may be pleasantly surprised, possibly.

Almost all of Tom Hooper's films are rated above a 7 on IMDb, but I've always found them dull and rote - while this one is a miss, at least he swung for the fences.

1690,Banhi,No.,1,21 September 2020,"The thing is, if you put world-classic actors in a popular musical (Ian McCallen and Judy Dench) but orchestrate the music poorly, then the movie ends up nothing more than a highfive into the face with a brick. I've been listening to, living and breathing this musical since I was 1,5 half years old (that's more than 20 years) and I am confident to say that I wouldn't have had any problem with shaping this to the eye/ear/taste of the young generation, but this is simply bad.

It's longer, usually.The plot isn't hard; Deuteronomy is judging a competition in which the winning cat will be reborn. The cats are trying to win.But the way these cats look. . Eeegads!

All the music and craziness people don't seem to get about it is exactly what audiences have loved about it all these decades. It's basically the original stage production with higher end effects. Being familiar with the story and the music going in, I found the movie fun, light, and a great way to bring the magic of Cats to a new generation. All the folks walking into this thing blind, expecting another big budget action film, got confused by the art and simplicity of the story and started hating on it for their own lack of understanding.

I saw Cats live way back when it was showing in London, and my family and I stayed in the Hotel Russell (""Up, up, up, past the Russell Hotel"") - what a treat that was.But this, what can I say? The costumes were beautiful and so was Francesca Hayward, playing Victoria. I hung on to hear Grizabella sing Memory; one of my all time favourite musical songs, but I was sadly disappointed. Jennifer Hudson cannot sing. It was truly dreadful. I could feel my whole body tensing up, so I fast forwarded through the rest of her song, and much of the remaining film. I did, however, enjoy the Magical Mr Mistoffelees scene, which included a reprise of Memory. I found that painful too, but perhaps it was supposed to be like that as it was a heavy scene; it was emotional, but not so musical, and I think Elaine Paige and Anita Harris (who played Grizabella in the performance that I saw) might agree.If you haven't already seen Elaine Paige's version, it is available on YouTube.",Cats

1696,pookiethemook,Me: 'Ow.',2,7 January 2020,"Cats is the musical phenomenon of the year. Unfortunately, the year is 1981. So the first 'proper' film version feels like something of a latecomer to the Jellicle Ball.Now don't get me wrong, I loved the stage show. It was my first taste of West End theatre and the sight of a cast of singers and dancers dressed as cats and let loose in a playground of oversized junk was quite a spectacle. I bought the t-shirt. I got the soundtrack. I learned the songs. I accepted it for what it was. I was 9 years old.So I approach the film version of 'Cats' as somebody who knows the music, the poetry and the characters really well. I have a certain nostalgic fondness for the piece and really can't comprehend what somebody would have thought of this entertainment had this been their first experience of the show.The story in 'Cats' doesn't really exist. The screenplay even alludes to this when the 'Jellicle choice' is being explained to the baffled audience: 'Each cat gets up and sings their song and tells us about their character and then Deuteronomy decides who deserves to be reborn' setting up some kind of school talent show with added reincarnation scenario. The writers soon run out of links to the next musical item though, indeed one of them is merely introduced with the horrible line 'right, shall we see the next contestant?', like they'd actually given up thinking of something interesting for the cats to say. The Jellicle choice is not exactly a great surprise to anybody either. Will it be the fat cat? Or the pesky thieves? Or the one who does magic? Or could it be the really downtrodden one who's fallen from grace and needs a bit of a lift? Judges, it's over to you.Those who mocked the trailer picked up on the scaling of the cats vs the backgrounds (which didn't bother me), on the substandard CGI (which is shoddy to say the least) and on the surreal physical appearance of the felines (which I actually found quite endearing, especially when their little ears moved in time with the music). My issues with the film were more about the performances, the music, the singing and the editing rather than the funny tails.A few performers come through with their reputations intact. Jennifer Hudson gives an emotional rendition of 'Memory' (which always surprises me by being a better song than I want it to be) and Robbie Fairchild is likable as Munkastrap. The Royal Ballet's Francesca Hayward is very watchable as she prances around and interacts with the other cats. Elsewhere there are a few poor fits and a couple of absolute howlers. Ian McKellen looks lost as he talks his way through 'Gus, The Theatre Cat', Taylor Swift is hardly used in her role as Bombalurina and Ray Winstone introduces himself as Growltiger and sings half a verse of his song before disappearing (presumably the rest of the number was cut). Judi Dench has one of the film's most awkward moments when, during the finale number, she begins to move up the scale to build the song before suddenly leaping down an octave to a note she can sing. I don't understand why it wasn't put in the right key for her (or why they didn't cast an actor who could sing it...) In terms of the most irritating performance, it's hard to choose between James Corden and Rebel Wilson. Both need to realise that gurning in front of the camera and then falling over does not equal comic relief. In fact, all of the attempts at humour in the film fall completely flat.Some of the music remains intact from the original soundtrack, including the Moogy synths of the overture. The arrangements have often been changed, and I wouldn't have a problem with this but they are usually worse than the original orchestrations. The standout success is the Skimbleshanks number which manages to present a euphoric tap routine on a train track (in 13/8 too!)
Other numbers are rather thrown away, and where the Jellicle Ball should be the pinnacle of dance in the film, it feels understated and not a patch on the exhilarating dance routines seen week by week on Strictly Come Dancing. This is not helped at all by the decision to shoot endless close-ups of the cats' faces rather than just letting the audience watch the dance. The opening ensemble number feels even more amateur, as cats start singing their solos but the editor doesn't bother to cut to them until halfway through their line.So, in summary, I didn't enjoy much of it. About an hour in I wanted the whole thing to end. It's got all sorts of technical problems and too many actors who are hopelessly miscast and misdirected in their roles. 'Cats' is one of the most curious failures of modern cinema. I'm glad I've seen it. I just never want to see it again.",Cats

It always felt disjointed, that it had no plot, and like the poems of TS Elliott had just been stitched togetherWell this movie version fixes that. It has a flowing storyline that makes sense, even if getting to the heavyside layer does feel like a feline talent show. The singing is generally awesome with a belter version of Memory, and Beautiful Ghosts fits in with the storyline very well.If you can get past some dodgy CGI in parts, the close ups are incredible.

1716,woodcarverb-72-80070,The Human Centipede 1-2 have better rating/reviews...,1,22 December 2019,"I rated Cats (2019) 2/10 #IMDbThis... this was extremely rough to get through. The way the cats looked was very disturbing. The CGI was very rough and there are whole scenes that are very cheaply done. The songs sung for a majority of this weren't delivered well as well as hard to listen to, which isn't the actors fault since most of them are not singers. The one song I was very skeptical and nervous about was Memories. I was very happy to see that it wasn't as atrocious as the trailer made it seem. It was delivered well. Then there is the story, if you are not familiar with the play then I believe you would have a hard time following along. Even tho I am familiar with the play, I still had a hard time following along with this. There were just random things that didn't help with the flow of the story I felt. Which isn't good when those random things were actually supposed to help make it flow better.Did I mention how creepy the cat-people looked? Honestly this might be the holy grail for people who identify as ""furries""...Now with a director (Tom Hooper) who has done musicals before and has some very highly praised films under his belt, Les Miserables (2012) The Danish Girl (2015) The Kong's Speech (2010) John Adams (2008, miniseries) Elizabeth I (2005, miniseries), this should have been so much better. This is a hard play to do in the first place, but we have seen his work and skill. This is trash sadly. Then there is a A-list cast. This had a little potential of being at least a decent film, not great but decent. but it was really really poorly done...If you know me and how I rate/review films, I am sometimes to ""forgiving"" when if comes to something I'm not a fan of. Sometimes I am to generous with how I rate things. I try hard to look at every aspect of what it takes to make a film. I pay attention to the work of the actors in the film, what the director has done before, what is going on in the life of the director and actors that might give a film a certain leaning, I even look at what is going on in the world that might sway a film. Among other things. I did all that for this film and I can't find a excuse for why it was so poorly done. That is my take on Cats (2019).

I am a huge musicals fan, so quite enjoyed the score, but the visuals were just... wow. I lasted about 30 seconds in the cinema before bursting out in laughter and I didn't stop the entire way through. Every time I regained my composure everyone's tails would twitch the same way or I'd catch sight of another well defined human/cat butt and I'd start all over again. Tears were rolling down my face! Luckily there was a woman in the row in front of me who shared in my hilarity and we'd set each other off!I could barely BREATHE when Idris Elba took off his coat. He just looked naked and slightly fluffy!!I'd honestly go and see it again. 10/10, never laughed so hard in my LIFE.",Cats
1721,Atj0817,Avoid at all costs,1,17 January 2020,"The first time I genuinely regretted eating food before seeing Cats was around the 93-minute mark. Magical Mr. Mistoffelees, a human being with human hands and feet coupled with cat ears and a top hat and horrendous CGI, was nervously pacing around the backstage of a dark theater that was filled with other human-cat hybrids. Suddenly, AMC's Dolby Surround Sound speaker system began to broadcast a slurping sound that grew louder and louder as Mr. Mistoffelees approaches a figure who was hunched near the sash cords at stage left. The source of the slurping was Sir Ian McKellen, a legendary actor who was vigorously lapping up milk from a steel bowl and licking his paw-hands. This deeply upsetting activity ceased only when he realized that Mr. Mistoffelees was there to check on him. I was trying my best not to gag. It was difficult.I saw this film on the evening of Wednesday, January 15, 2020, and while I'd originally assumed that one or two songs would inevitably linger in my head long after I'd left the theater, it was actually the slurping coming from the mouth of Magneto/Gandalf/Richard III that has haunted me for the past 48 hours and counting.",Cats

However, I must say, I truly feel sorry for every single person who have this film a negative review. It is clear that you don't know Cats and you don't appreciate good art on screen. If you don't understand Cats, if you don't appreciate Andrew Lloyd Weber, if you don't recognize the brilliant CG artistry behind this film, if you don't care about Tony Awards or the fact that this was the fourth longest running show on Broadway, or if you simply don't have good taste, go ahead and give this beautiful film a bad review- we won't hold it against you.",Cats

It's a film version of a live song-and-modern-dance revue based on a small book of poems. There is not a strong story in either book or stage show. The stage version ran for so long, and continues to be staged, because it's a dance spectacular with catchy songs. Cats is played by adult humans dressed in leotards, simulating a cat-like demeanour, because that is what this musical is. No doubt this film could have been animated or CGI-ed but that would lose one very important consideration in the whole shebang: Cats is not actually about cats, It's about people.",Cats

So it really helps with much foreseeable disappointments. So I managed to get quite a good experience with this, especially coming to towards the end.Bad: the skintight were really unnecessary for most of the cats. Many should be better off with longer furs to cover the proper parts. The CG is also overly used with even some parts seen flickering. The facial placement on such character is REALLY weird, even when I'm warned early, The mouse is really the worst.Good: The better performance comes towards the later parts of the story with better performers. The last even bring me some tears. The story itself finally comes to life when concluding towards the end.

It was thoroughly entertaining.",Cats
1731,dtao12,Suspend disbelief and enjoy it,8,29 December 2019,"As a fan of the original Broadway Cats, I was not surprised by the ""lack of plot"" and the sight of humans impersonating (incatonating?) felines. I think many of the movie audience were surprised by those things. Cats is a spectacle, not a ""movie"" in the traditional sense.The dancing and cinematography are very good, it's a visual treat, and there are lots of clever touches in the movement and gestures. While most of the dancing is similar to what could be seen on Broadway, there are interesting changes of scene that provide variety beyond what you'd see on stage.The strongest portions are the big production numbers such as Jellicle Cats, Skimbleshanks, Macavity, and Mr. Mistoffeles, because the ensemble (real singers and dancers) can shine, even if most of them are unknown and you don't even know their characters' names.One flaw is that there's too much ""talking"" rather than ""singing"" in some songs. Tom Hooper directed similarly in Les Miz, where the beauty of the singing was largely sacrificed for overly dramatic/emotive (and ultimately unsuccessful) declamation. Why direct musicals if you don't like singing? Because of that propensity, the singing is a mixed bag. There are strong ensemble performances. The weaknesses are in some of the ""big names"" that, Hollywood insistscasting on in musicals, instead of hundreds of better qualified actors. Of the celebrities, Taylor Swift is excellent although she has only one song and little screen time. Francesca Hayward (ballerina) is an excellent dancer, decent singer, and charming as ""Victoria"" the main cat in this revised story. Jennifer Hudson can obviously sing but her ""Memory"" is chopped into fragments and overacted/undersung, rather than just letting her voice and the music do the emoting for her, which I would have preferred. Derulo, Elba, Corden, Wilson, and McKellen are all competent. Judi Dench, however, is terribly miscast as Deutoronomy, as she can barely sing, and the big ""Ad-dressing of Cats"" song which should be climactic is almost ruined byu her non-singing, though redeemed somewhat when the ensemble takes over.So I enjoyed it, as did my other family members, one of whom is a Broadway ""Cats"" fan and the other was her daughter who knew almost nothing about Cats. It could have been better, but it is not the disaster that many reviews are saying. Musicals just aren't for everyone, particularly this very unusual musical.",Cats

The cast is generally excellent and their enthusiasm helps invest in the characters.There are some miss-steps along the way. Interrupting some of the songs disrupts the rhythm.

In the future, heaven got too crowded after the Book of Mormons came to pass. God became Jellicle, created the Heavyside Layer to roof heaven shut.With the Heavyside Layer cemented atop top heaven, Satan got out of Earth. He became Macavity. Unknowing of this error, Jellicle destroyed the earth, but decided that he liked American Idol and Paula Abdul's take on it, so Jellicle brought Paula back in a new Jellicle form.When he discovers what has become of Macavity, concerned that he will lead many evil cats to Catnip, unfairly excluding Cats from Heaviside, he appoints Paula as Old Deuteronomy, to tell the world of the Great Jellicle's existence.
Just like American Idol, only one will be chosen. To earn a new eternal life, cats must grapple with what they couldn't solve after the Book of Mormon came to pass: Human pride channeled into cats and their lives. We speak all of their names and evaluate the life they have chosen.When pride is broken & Grizabella is finally touched, her name spoken aloud, Paula Abdul, our John the Baptist, Old Deuteronomy, sends Grizabella to the Heaviside Layer as Jellicle planned for Grizabella. Her disciples, the Jellicle cats, worshipping our new Jesus, Grizabella.Now that she has ascended, the best disciples will be chosen every year by the Holy Spirit, Old Deuteronomy, during the Jellicle Ball. The Jellicles, fighting the forces of evil, temporarily defeat Satan, Macavity himself.The Jelicle Cats are imbued with the Spirit of Jellicle and The Book of Grizabella is spoken orally to the Disciples. The first commandment is ""a cat is not a dog."" The pact is made between Jellicle & Cat to make disciples of Jellicle.All who accept Him into their lives become a Jellicle Cat.",Cats

1750,monkeygamers,Not that bad but not that great,7,28 December 2019,"Very much like the musical, Cats the movie follows a similar path. When I first watched the musical, I thought the costumes were weird. The movie is not that much different, in that respect. However, what Cats lacks visually is made up for by its dedication to the music.One thing the movie does better than the musical is it explained the plot better. It was able to explain the world they lived in far better than a stage show could do.I liked that the songs were sung well. I will provide an unpopular opinion here, and say that Jennifer Hudson's singing of ""Memory"" was too much crying and not enough of the powerhouse that that song deserves.I disliked the way Idris Elba's character was portrayed. The green contacts did not work well, and I didn't think that they should have vilified him in the way they did.The song they added for the movie was far too simple compared to the other songs, and felt very cliche. It doesn't match the style and lyricism that the other songs possess.One thing that Andrew Lloyd Webber was doing that was revolutionary during the 80s, was that he added a rock vibe to musicals. This is one reason why this musical did so well. The movie doesn't add much more to that except a little better explanation, visually. There's nothing beyond that that is as new and exciting. People who didn't experience these changes in the 80s probably wouldn't get how profound Cats and Phantom were, when most musicals were pretty tame.I also disagree with anyone who says these songs aren't catchy. (I've had Skimbleshank's song in my head for a good part of the week.)I was surprised at how much dancing was done during the movie, and I enjoyed the cat-like way they danced.I think the Deuteronomy gender swap was a good choice, since it gave her a more motherly role. Her affection towards Gus was cute. I would also think that it was a nod to the Queen of England. A fitting comparison for Dame Judy Dench, although considering the reception this movie has received, might be something she'd want to distance herself from.",Cats

1754,rewtmoose,Musicals don't translate well to the screen,3,12 September 2021,"I'm an avid IMBb user, reading reviews, watching trailers, always growing my watchlist, rating everything I see ... but this is the first time I've felt I needed to write at least a short review myself. Not necessarily because of the movie itself, but because of all the talk around it.Let's be clear: this is not a good movie. It struggles in telling the tiny bit of story there is to tell. It's nonsensical in the way that's only enjoyable while intoxicated, if even then. It's so full of spectacle that it loses its effect, because once something's over we're already jumped by the next bit. There's a pun or a fourth-wall-break-like joke too many to keep any cinematic immersion up. Then, there's a lot of choices in for example how to do the CGI, how actors should act cat-like, etc., that just don't work. It all becomes a silly, all at once overwhelming and underwhelming, shallow, and to a large part boring movie experience.But is it the worst movie ever made? No. It's just a musical movie that went too far in being a musical for people to accept it as a movie. That's my problem with ALL musical movies; they are rarely good movie experiences, but could be enjoyed as musicals on screen. Personally, I feel that in some ways this one works better than many other musical movies in that it goes so far in being an over-the-top musical, with technology allowing it to be more than a stage production ever could in terms of creative vision, that it actually warrants the kind of unnatural, quirky theatrics that otherwise make me cringe too hard to enjoy musical movies at all.So, rather than just nodding along with ""Wth did I just watch 1/10"", a fair way to review this movie would probably be to recognise that it went all-out in being exactly the kind of musical mess it was intended to be all along, and that it made for a poor movie experience. Worst of all time? Not by far. Recommended? Definitely not.",Cats

To see how funny they can be while delivering their negative review, but read them, it's rare to see someone actually commenting on the film, they're all just stupid one-liners.The point I'm trying to make is that Cats is actually a lot of fun. It's weird and wild and everything that Cats has ALWAYS BEEN. If you don't like Andrew Lloyd Webber's music, you probably won't be interested. If you just don't like musicals, maybe not for you. If you can't check out of the real world and into a fantasy for a couple of hours, don't bother. But if you're willing to suspend belief for a couple of hours, Cats is actually a really good time.Cats has always been humans dressed as cats, singing and dancing and flipping all over the stage, if that makes you uncomfortable, find something else to watch.

1768,droduner,What did you expect?,7,6 January 2020,"Cats is based upon a Broadway musical by Andrew Lloyd Weber which has no plot, and never intended to have one. It is a revue. If you expect something more from it, you will be sadly mistaken. For those not familiar with the concept, a revue is, and I quote, ""a light theatrical entertainment consisting of a series of short sketches, songs, and dances."" So it has *no plot.* If you are expecting some deep story, you will be sadly mistaken.It is based on some cute poems that poet TS Elliot wrote for his godchildren in letters during the 1930s. They are whimsical and were collected together into a published work as Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats. Each poem told a tale for children about a certain cat or cats. So Andrew Lloyd Weber set these to music in his hummable but derivative style and made a theatrical piece out of it, using the childlike poetry to be an excuse to have some majorly impressive dancing. Hate Cats or not, you have to respect the athleticism and skill in the dancing.The film version feels it is necessary to attempt to create a thin bit of plot around a revue. This doesn't really work, because as I've already said, there is none. The last line of the film is pointless and almost makes you roll your eyes. I used to love the musical as a child before I discovered things that actually had something deeper than light entertainment. However, I did enjoy it at the time, and the music is still entertaining. So I can view this film for what it is: mindless entertainment. West Side Story this is not.The film version works somewhat, and doesn't for the rest. The character Victoria is used as the audience's foil, taking us into the world of Jellicle cats, and attempting to explain why different cats have songs sung about them or sing about themselves. CGI sets are used, and sometimes overused, to match the particular cat. The original show was a one set in a junkyard, with charming oversized fishbones and assorted trash. Instead, we are mainly around Russell Square in London in the film.This film has limited dancing compared to the show it is adapting, which is a shame. The Jenny-Any-Dots number with Rebel Wilson is especially disappointing, as this was a wonderful tap number on stage, and now is CGI fest with cockroaches and mice, with Rebel bouncing around a little. Some character development was attempted, especially in the Magical Mister Mistoffelees number, but it's rather ineffective. A looming presence of Macavity is spread throughout the film to attempt to have a bit of tension. It is somewhat effective. One of the most boring songs in all of musical theatre, ""Moments of Happiness,"" is thankfully cut to about 30 seconds. The rousing ""Growltiger's Last Stand,"" is sadly cut to a few measures, but the racist line in it that may have been ok in 1930, but is absolutely unacceptable in 2020, makes the decision somewhat understandable.It's a delight to see Dame Judi Dench and Sir Ian McKellen, though they are obviously not singers. Judi plays a male part, by a large man in a shaggy dog like costume. Her different take works fine. They do the best they can.
When there is dancing in Cats, it sometimes works well. The Skimbleshanks number adds some much need energy to the dumbed down choreography in other numbers. Jennifer Hudson plays Grizabella, with the popular number that makes Cats famous, ""Memory."" Overall she does well, but I don't get the shots of her with mucus coming out of her nose. Surely she can act without these particular bodily fluids?Rebel Wilson and James Corden do ok with their parts, though the director chose to cut away in the middle of some songs to give them obligatory ""funny comments"" that don't really work. It's a frustrating decision, but that's just my opinion. Since I'm so familiar with the source material, it could be that I am unable to see this different take without prejudice.Even so, it was overall enjoyable. It will never stand up to the original stage show, but it did have me going back to Youtube to remember younger days, enjoying the original show and its choreography. I enjoyed seeing it enough once. I don't think it would see it again. It's not great, and it's not perfect, but if you can see it for what it is, it's an ok way to kill two hours.",Cats

The term CGI is now a ""thing"" apparently, used by every tech-wise reviewer to show how tech-wise they are. They had a field day dissing its use in this film. The plot was a contest (""Who gets to be chosen for a new life?) and nothing more.Well, I'm glad to say my friend and I actually got a kick out of the movie and enjoyed it for its originality of presentation, the seamless insertions of song-appropriate scenery, and the typical cat behaviors performed by both young and old felines. It was naive, ingenuous and attempted to be no more than that.As for Jennifer Hudson, I felt her character interpreted the despair of ""Memory"" beautifully--the short screeching part not so much--and thus did not need to imitate Barbra Streisand's uplifting, hopeful ending.Read my review title again and consider this movie in that context.(Also please consider using spell-check, or just rereading your review for more than its ingenious brilliance--before submitting it.)",Cats

They clearly were expecting something that would appeal to their limited attention span. Sadly for them, this requires input from one's brain AND one's creative side. It certainly is NOT a shoot-me-up, not a thriller, nor a horror movie. Rather, this is a movie that invites you to engage with another world, one that has been beautifully crafted. It is obvious from the reviews that people are uncomfortable with costumes that do not look like the costumes they are so used to in the above-mentioned movies. But this is something that's coming from inside of them, and has nothing to do with the very well crafted cat ""suits"". Rather than give a bad review, it would be advisable to perhaps look at the reason why these suits grate on so many people.
No, this is certainly not a movie that gives you a shot of adrenaline for 5 seconds and then leaves you wanting another shot. This is 1 hour and 40 minutes of pure enjoyment engaging with a world that could be just as easily a parallel world to ours rather than a fantasy.

I understand that it won't be to everyone's taste as Cats its not your average musical but if you compare it to it's predecessor the it's brilliant. The fact the had the budget to go bigger and more realistic then you could ever do on stage is a fantastic achievement. The celebrity appearances may not be vocally as impressive as the stage verity but they add there own energy and make the role there own. People that complain of the lack or story should see the original before they moan. For people that like the original I'd say go see it it's a big budget reimagining of the classic, for people that are going into it first time I'd suggest doing some research first!",Cats
1791,lalapauley,If you're willing to suspend your disbelief and read a little background... It's really not that bad,7,28 June 2020,"Yo... I've never written a review on here but I've also never felt such a mixture of emotions after watching a movie so here goes...
I know that this movie has gotten historically horrible reviews. But I think it's important to understand the levity of what you're getting into with this piece. Like, yes, Cats is weird. It's ridiculous. It's so weird it's almost absurd. But, like, that's Cats. That's what made the stage musical so popular. It's weird and inventive and consuming and transports you into this strange world. That's the point.
That being said, I can see how just walking into this movie with no previous knowledge or experience with the musical would be a disturbing experience. If you don't know these characters or understand the basis of what they're doing, it is definitely like some weird acid trip. So to those of you debating on whether or not to watch, I say go for it! But maybe watch a few YouTube videos of the 1998 filmed stage version, or at least read a brief synopsis on Wikipedia. But also be sure to keep in mind that this musical broke boundaries and reinvented musical theatre when it was released. Did many people hate it/fear it? Sure. Is it one of the most popular musicals ever? Yup.
Anyway, I found this film to be really enjoyable! I do think that a large extent of my joy was due to the fact that I'm familiar with the stage show, and it was really cool to see how they translated the stage version into a theatrical format. But overall, I found it enjoyable and even moving.
But I also want to be clear and say that there were some very, VERY bad parts in this movie. Like, astonishingly awful. In particular, the scenes with Rebel Wilson and James Corden. (What were they thinking....? And the excessive fat jokes... Seriously?)
But those ASIDE, i Honestly think that if you're willing to suspend disbelief, this is a perfectly good, entertaining, even MOVING movie. Yes, the CGI takes some getting used to. I eventually did.
I thought Jennifer Hudson and Francesca Hayward shone in their roles! I loved the addition of their connection. Really powerful. And Robbie Fairchild KILLED it as Munkustrap. Seriously. He went so hard. I didn't really care for Judi Dench's performance. But I feel like, overall, the cast tried their best! The dancing was really good.
When I finished this movie, I wanted to cry. Not really sure why. I don't think I've ever felt such a strange reaction to a movie before.
I'm not even sure if this review made any sense but, look. Is it an awful movie? Yes. Is it a good movie? Yes. Did I enjoy it? Yes. Am I slightly ashamed of that? Definitely.",Cats

If you don't ""get"" Cats then maybe I could see some people not enjoying it. HOWEVER, having said that, I loved it.
The producers didn't stray too far from the original musical production. I was afraid they would try and rewrite it to make it more commercially palatable. I LOVE the CGI fur and ears on the actors. You can see they tried very hard to mimic cat movements. The actors are actually able to sing their character parts. They didn't just throw a well known actor in and hope they could sing. Rebel Wilson sounds like a perfect Jennyanydots - waver in the voice and all. Munkustrap (who narrates the majority of the show) has a very clear tone and can carry any part he needs to. I was happy they didn't try and shove TayTay at all of us - she has a very small part all things considered. Francesca Heyward is lovely as Victoria. Her dancing skills show off the power AND grace needed to carry the main character. Jennifer Hudson's version of Memory is mature and moving. Memory is notoriously difficult to sing and singing it well is just that much harder.
All in all this version gives a bit more ""story"" to the musical. You get to see Victoria's interest in Grizabella and her compassion for Miss Griz. Dame Judy is brilliant as always even though she cannot sing as strongly as the rest of the cast. Since she plays the sage older Deuteronomy it makes sense.
This should be up for best special effects or costuming. The ears especially give so much expression to each cat.
If you have seen the Broadway version you will understand why sticking close to the source material is important. Each cat contributes to the flow of the story - even the chorus cats. Most of them have actual names (Bomburlina, Coricopat, Syllabub). In the penultimate action Mr. Mistoffelees is adorable and you can see the confidence build. He is much more shy in the movie than the stage production but it works really well in the growth of his relationship to Victoria.",Cats

I have read T.S.Eliot's ""Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats"" twice. And I have seen the stage musical 4 or 5 times in the 90s and loved it. But a movie gives you close-ups of facial expressions and (feline) interaction that is not visible on a live stage. The music was as I remembered with a few additional songs, and some spoken parts to help the narrative. The actors dressed/CGI'd as cats, is no more unexpected than they were on stage. I don't deny that people who are not at all familiar with the book nor stage production, may find the appearance of the ""cats"" to be unusual, and the songs somewhat disconnected.

1805,keatonspeak,A Wonderful Adaptation of a Truly Eclectic Work,8,25 December 2019,"Ok. So here's the deal.Yes, it's Cats: the notorious musical. Yes, at its core, it's a bunch of people dressed up pretending to be cats. Yes, it is what it is, and it's incredibly campy and pointless. And yes, I do have a bias in favor of Andrew Lloyd Webber and his works.That being said, I absolutely loved this film. I'm completely serious; I really loved it.This adaptation provided a little more cohesion and story to the script, which really helped me follow certain characters and certain objectives. I loved how they fleshed out the character of Victoria more to be a true central figure we can follow, and it made the Jellicle Choice at the end very impactful.The greatest thing about the film was the performances. Jennifer Hudson truly brought her A game not just with her vocal chops, but to her characterization of Grizabella. Judi Dench brought a wonderful sense of warmth and comfort with her old Deuteronomy. Francesa Hayward absolutely shined in her debut role as Victoria, and her skills as a ballerina were effortless and impeccable. Other highlights were Robert Fairchild as Munkustrap and his dancing prowess, Rebel Wilson as the clumsy Jennyanydots, and even Jason Derulo giving us some smooth vocals as Rum Tum Tugger.The true highlight for me was Ian McKellen as Gus the Theatre Cat. In a very ""meta"" role for him playing an old, but not necessarily faded star of the stage, he showed once again why he is one of the absolute legends of acting. And he did it all dressed as a cat.The aspect I loved most is that everyone was so incredibly dedicated and committed to what they were doing. These are all world class artists at the top of their game. They could have phoned it in knowing what a travesty it could be, but instead, they gave their all and told the story like artists are supposed to.Not that the film didn't have its flaws, of course. The CGI could have been much better, but it didn't detract from the experience for me. Taylor Swift was very underwhelming singing ""Macavity the Mystery Cat"", and Idris Elba just didn't mesh with the role of Macavity.I would ask that all the naysayers and skeptics who have not seen it to go in with a fresh perspective while also fully accepting what you're getting into.

If you think the most anticipated song of the whole show, Memory , could do no wrong after a long torturing waiting-time? It went terribly wrong and disappointing, but ""I only expected this 3 minutes to be ok, I expected nothing more!"".... This song sung by Jennifer Hudson had got to be good..... Wrong, it's the worst moment of the entire movie, it was way over done, it's NOT a stage show, it's a movie, but the director thought he did the sad sappy thing in Les Miserables and "" let's repeat history again"" and no need to build up her character !!!
And then, the makeup, costumes, choreography ? >>> way way way TOO SAFE!!!

1814,ozcammy,"Bad CGI but if you can bear it, the film is actually enjoyable",6,3 January 2020,"I watched Cats two days ago and I have since spent some time reflecting on the movie. I think I'm ready to give it my own personal review. It would easy to fall into the trap of making some cat puns and calling it ""uncanny valley"" and just leaving it at that but I want to give it an honest review, even if it goes somewhat against the popular critical opinion.To start, the elephant in the room needs to be addressed, that there is no doubt that the CGI of the movie is its weakest element. The opening scenes of the movie in particular are something out of a nightmare fever dream but after those scenes to some degree you do get used to it. The shock of seeing a human with CGI fur wears off to an extent. However there is still many moment within the film where some particular movement or camera angle gives you a shiver up your spine and the distinct feeling of 'wrongness'. That being said, the CGI of the cats has nothing on the mice (fat, 'cute' CGI rodents, played by children) which were downright unsettling to watch. The cockroaches with human faces were also disturbing but fortunately only feature briefly in the movie. Tom Hooper's choice of giving some cats various pieces of clothing was also jarring. Just as you're getting used to the CGI fur, a cat will unsettlingly bust out a sequin dress or start break dancing wearing nothing but sneakers.In terms of their performance, the actors themselves do an excellent job of portraying their characters. Unfortunately this means I will never rid myself of the image of Ian McKellen lapping water from a bowl and licking his paws. There was a number of slapstick comedy moments peppered throughout the movie which I felt fell flat, I don't find it funny when I'm told ""laugh at the fat person doing the dumb thing!"", I think they could've made it more comedic by being more subtle.The lead actress Francesca Hayward's ballet background shone through well and was very enjoyable to watch. Extending from that, I genuinely enjoyed the choreography throughout the movie. My only criticism is that at times the CGI got in the way of the dancing and it became difficult to tell what was human talent and what was just computer generated.When I first saw the trailer and saw Tom Hooper was directing, I was looking forward to the score. The music certainly didn't let me down, with a fresh touch on all of the classic Cats songs. In particular the harmonies of Old Deuteronomy were a joyous thing to listen to, a stark comparison to the musical version which I considered downright boring. Taylor Swift's contribution, 'Beautiful Ghosts', fit in well with the tone of the film and was one of the strongest songs. I was only disappointed by Memory, which I felt was sung over dramatically. Don't get me wrong, it's supposed to be an emotional song but Jennifer Hudson sounded like she was barely choking it out through all the tears. There's a beautiful song in there buried under the singers snot covered face and so much vibrato I thought she was singing it through a desk fan set to high.Overall the tone of the movie and the way it's presented is very much true to the source material. If you've watched the musical version of Cats and a trailer for the movie (to give a taste of the CGI) I think you would be fairly comfortable in knowing what you're in for. There was some moments and musical items which dragged on and ruined the pacing of the movie to a degree. And unfortunately the closing number, 'The Ad-dressing Of Cats' is a weak way to end the film, I think they should've have thrown in something extra in at the end to make it end on a bang, but that's just personal preference.A lot of the movie critic reviews I've read do nothing but drag the movie through the mud from beginning to end, but I wonder if that's because these critics went in with no prior knowledge of Cats, other than knowing it to be a popular Broadway musical. I'd be interested to see what theatre critics have to say about it, as it truly felt more like a theatre performance than a movie. In summary I feel the CGI deserves a lot of the hate it has received however I walked out of the cinema thoroughly entertained and would likely watch the movie again in the future.",Cats

I saw the stage show in both New York and London, plus I had the version on VHS. In those the cast played to the audience. In this one they introduced a new cat (Francesca Hayward was wonderful) to play to which I thought a great touch. If I didn't already know the story, I might be lost by it with seemingly random songs. Beautiful Ghosts was a great addition. Although I don't think Dame Judy could hit the deep bass notes which were the signature of Old Deuteronomy. But this wasn't the entire production. I was waiting for The Awful Battle of the Pekes and the Pollicles, and it never came. I would have loved to see the cats imitating the dogs as in the stage version.

It lacked the energy of the stage show.I think it was still hard for some to understand - it's really not and was never meant to be a continuous story. The best way I can explain is that each cat is telling their story and are trying to be selected to redeem one of their nine lives.The dancing was great!

We went to see the film and we both really loved it! My 9 year old son understood the storyline and the humor that was written into the screenplay. Yes, there could have been SOME improvements, like a black nose and line down to the upper lip and more furry parts of the ""costumes"" (like Grizabella, Old Deuteronomy and Aspara""Gus""). I had never seen it on stage but watched it on YouTube to get a feel for the film. The stage performance left some to be desired. However, Old Deuteronomy is best as a male cat (even though Judi Dench did a terrific job in the role). I loved the signs all throughout the dancing and singing numbers although I am sure I missed some. I WILL be purchasing this film on DVD when it is released. The music was beautiful and the dancing was splendid.",Cats

Eliot book, and/or see the original stage production of which this movie was based on? I attended a pre-screening before the public opening, and went again on Christmas eve. The improved edit wasn't shown yet.
This Cats was quite the undertaking and everyone involved stepped up to the plate, and hit it out of the park! T.S. Eliot's cat character parts were expanded, including updated dance choreography blending classical ballet, contemporary, and hip-hop. Some minor dance improve was missing that were in the stage version however.To expand on Tom Hooper's mention of inclusion. It also touches on abandonment ageism, compassion, empathy, good versus evil. This Cats has all these elements if viewers can see beyond the overwhelming CGI. My favorites scenes began with scenes with the appearance of Old Deuteronomy, Mr. Mistoffelees, the Jellicle Ball sequence reminiscent of Stravinsky's (Martha Grahams) production of The Rite of Spring Pagan dance of the Chosen One, up to the Cats ascension to the Heaviside Layer.

Why did all these actors agreed to be compromised in this is beyond me. How did a movie with such bad CGI ever see the light of day is a tragedy in itself.

Is prob the best review i can say.
Whats the point of taking a stage show and making a blockbuster movie that looks like a stage show. Every scene looks like a cardboard or cgi backdrop. So its hard to buy-in to the feline world. It all looks fake. Its all so dull
And feels like a three hour movie rather than a two hour movie. Nothing really happens. laurie Davidson & Francesca Hayward shine out though despite all the high profile cast. Francesca as a cat is strangely arousing.
Jennifer Hudson as Grizabella has a house raising moment. But Mckellan, Dench,Derulo, Elba, Winstone are all wasted here in un-memorable parts in a to be honest un-memorable movie. To be frank, It needed Sir Tim Rice (as do all Sir Andrew Lloyd Webber productions) 3/10",Cats

(Which is not really a criticism) - I actually very much enjoyed it..... Then again I loved the theatre version - there were slight variations which made it more suited to screen which was necessary. 9/10 from me (because Taylor swift really didn't do justice to her role) - Maybe She should just stick to pop singing? ....... my other fave songs didn't disappoint and I still cried at memory.,Cats

It's like a competition - who's gonna come up with the worst. While the CGI really is rather poor and unfinished, the rest looked pretty okay to me. What's more, I even loved the dancing and the singing. It's obvious that a lot of effort, time and soul went into the making of this movie and it's not fair to ignore that. Tom Hooper is a brilliant director - maybe he should have had more patience and waited a few more years before he made that movie, that's true. But the film is not hideous, nor more cringe worthy than The Shape of Water for example (I personally hated that one). Overall, I would give it a 6 because I am not a fan of movies with little to no plot, but I want to help up its rating, so an 8 it is. If you love musicals, give it a try despite the bad reviews.

1844,ezekiel264,Only Saved by Memory,3,22 December 2019,"I've been a fan of Broadway shows for my entire life. Of course I'm always concerned when I see one being made into a Movie Version. Cats is certainly not one of my favorite shows, but I recognize that many people like it and I appreciate what it takes to bring it to life on stage. However, I felt so cheated after I bought my ticket to see this film adaptation. The singing and acting and dancing isn't really bad in my very humble opinion, but it just looks uncomfortable to watch. At first, I was some what impressed by the special effects to make the actors into ""cats"" but especially in closer shots, it just looks very weird to me. My other big problem with this movie is the same I have with the stage version: the plot is just bad and really kind of cheap. The only storyline that is at all interesting to me and really elicits emotion from me is the plot line of Grizabella. All the other cats lack a real motivation to root for them. Now I should say that I was absolutely blown away by Jennifer Hudson's Memory. She really truly did a truly fantastic and brilliant job with the song. The last fifteen minutes of the movie that includes her and her story again are actually very fascinating and present a rather compelling tale. Memory could definitely make seeing this movie worth it, but there's a lot of other stuff to sit through.",Cats

1848,katharinakrause82,"It's not THAT bad: Weird CGI, but great performances!",5,8 July 2020,"As a fan of the musical I have to admit: yes, the CGI cat creatures look weird and artificial. Yes, the dancing is not convincing because of the added special effects. And yes, the size of the cats changes illogically and their tails move in a strange uncatlike way...But what annoys me is that not one of the reviews I read mentions the actor's performances which I really enjoyed. Sure, they are not all 100 % convincing, but Jason Derulo as Rum Tum Tugger does a great job with his charm and souly melismas. Same goes for Laurie Davidson who plays Mr Mistoffelees as a shy, unsure sweet character in contrast to the self confident star magician of the stage version. My two personal highlights of the film were Sir Ian McKellen's and Jennifer Hudson's performance who outshined all other takes of the characters I've seen before. Sir Ian absolutely nailed the image of the theatre veteran whereas Hudson's powerful voice expressed all the pain and sadness of loss in the musical's most famous song ""Memory"".Last but not least I do not understand why people complain about the lack of plot. The musical Cats simply does not have one, so how on earth are the script writers supposed to come up with a plot for a musical which was never designed to have a plot but is more a kind of revue? They added some minor plot lines by changing some details of the original show which to my mind is totally fine.To sum it up: If you like the musical give the film a chance. Try to ignore the weird design and enjoy the performances.",Cats

WHAT!?' before the children started looking at their phones to distract them from the hideous mess that was assaulting our eyeballs. I, dear reader, persevered, despite every fiber of my body telling me otherwise. I only gave this a rating of two because there were brief elements of so-bad-it's-good (ripping the heads off tapdancing cockroaches with human heads, was one shining example).

This movie should be properly classified as a violent crime against my eyes and ears, not to mention against good taste in general. I guess I do have to admit that the costumes, the set and props as well as the CGI artists did a wonderful job, but God, why did anyone think this was something worth creating?!

I liked that it was more than just props and I've been watching the original VHS version for about 20 years. It's my all time favorite play and if I had to choose one song to listen to for the rest of my life I would choose memory. Taylor swift is barely in his movie so I don't get all the negative comments about her and she does a good job imo. And the comments about cats with hands.... Uhhh did you even watch the play? You can see their hands too. Have you never watched an anime? Cat people are adorable lol. Jennifer Hudson did memory justice and I teared up watching her sing it just like every other time I've watched the play. I also liked that they added a bit of humor to some of the scenes. Whole theater was laughing and my 10 year old loved it. I feel like a lot of negative reviews are people who can't accept change or adaptations so they go out of their way to bring a movie down.

1859,gmfrank212,Why so much Hate?,8,29 December 2019,"Honestly, if you are a true theater lover / dancer you can embrace this movie. I've been a fan of Cats since a small child (talking 4 years old) - and I have also had the wonderful fortune of seeing a production live as well as performing in one as a singer and featured dancer. I felt this adaptation was pretty well thought out and executed to a great level for the big screen. It had the playfulness and musical power of the stage production (thank you, Andrew Llyod Weber, executive producer and executive music director) with all of the performers really embracing their roles and performing at an amazing level. You get so much more context from this movie and there seems to more plot line then in the original story. I loved the added dialogue to create the context - and loved the character choices of Idris Alba and the director Tom Hopper to bring Macavity more to life then in the original Broadway production. I felt every actor and actress in this version executed their characters very well (thank you to Robbie Fairchild as Munkstrap - my fave cat!)- but an EXCEPTIONAL shout out to Jennifer Hudson who embodied such a beautiful version of Grizabella! (Memory made me cry)
As far as CGI - if you can go to a Marvel movie and see Josh Brolin as Thanos and have no issue or see a ""youngified"" version of Michael Douglas then why is there such an issue with seeing performers as cats in CGI?? When I performed in the show it was leotards, wigs with Cat ears, loads of make-up and tails that swung around lifeless (while sometimes getting caught during the dancing) - at least in the movie version we get tails that are interactive.
So inconclusion, I could continue to rave about each individual character, the settings, the directorial choices, dance, etc. but I leave with: if you are a theater nerd or you are a dancer this movie is for you.DANCERS: Les Twins are featured and the Jellical Ball is PHENOMENALLY executed.But Haters got to Hate I guess.....",Cats

If not, well, you missed something magical. I saw it in London in 1988: the music, dancing and singing are comparable, but this experience just does not translate to the medium of film. Still, just as some pieces of art are massively hyped, this one is being massively panned. The weakest scene was with Jennyanydots (dancing mice and cockroaches just doesn't work), but is more than compensated for by Gus, Grizabella, Macavity and Old Deuteronomy.

Yes the CG at times can be a bit discomforting but not with the Cats (mostly) just the weird cockroaches and mice. Otherwise the film creates a very interesting feel with the human/cat look.Next is the changes from the Stage to the film. Not at all bad. Though sometimes you may forget, you are watching a film and not a stage performance. Changes had to be made and the ones that were made did not harm the story in any way.Finally the main point here. The music and performances were great. The people who are lambasting the choreography and singing ability of these actors are obviously not watching the same movie I am. The music is great. The choreography is fantastic. Get over it.Mob mentality rules in modern culture and because of that we may not get to see something quite as interesting as this again.

Francesca Hayward is great as is Taylor Swift's original song.It appears to me that the negative reviews can all be summed up into four categories:People who don't like the animation; alright, but it doesn't really detract from the singing and dancingPeople unfamiliar with the musical and who were expecting something very different; be familiar with the materialPeople who are purists for the musical and don't like the changes; the changes are mostly positive, though I don't like the re-scoring of ""Mungojerrie and Rumpleteazer.""People who don't like James Corden; he does a great job with Bustopher Jones.

1870,celamantia,Better than it gets credit for,7,21 March 2020,"CATS is, in no uncertain terms, unusual. Not just this movie, mind you; the whole concept of the stories of cats told through TS Eliot's poetry. The original stage show had very little plot, and the original poems of course have none.This movie should appeal mostly to fans of the original musical. Unfortunately, whoever designed the trailers seemed to be trying to draw in non-musical fans; as a result, many are kept away by a criminally bad trailer.The story is set in motion by the tragic arrival of Victoria; a dancer in the original, here she functions as the audience surrogate, and later in the story takes on the duties originally given to Jemima in the stage play. The opening number starts in a beautiful approximation of the original play's junkyard.No review if this film can avoid talk of the CGI. I did not feel the ""uncanny valley"" issues so many complained about (but I saw the home video version which may be fixed up). The animated ears are a nice touch and really add character. The tails I'm not so sure about. I'd personally have preferred somewhere halfway between the stage makeup/costumes and what we have here. Where the animation wa disconcerting is in any jumps or acrobatic moves. Most video games have better looking jumps than these; it's like the animators have never seen either a cat or a dancer leap, and thus we get these graceless aerobatics that yank you out of your immersion.The movie takes many liberties with the source material; Jennyanydots and Bustopher Jones are robbed of all their dignity by Rebel Wilson and James Corden's slapstick. An odd choice was to have many of the characters sing their own songs when originally they were sung by other cats about them, which makes many of the asides in them make no sense at all. This is most noticeable in Gus the Theatre Cat, and having Gus and Jennyanydots do their own songs reduces poor Jellylorum to a silent background part. And Bombalurina, normally a major part in several songs, is reduced to a brief cameo by Taylor Swift.But the show itself still put me through an emotional wringer. Jennifer Hudson absolutely slays ""Memory"" (normally my least favorite song in the show), and Victoria's new song ""Beautiful Ghosts"" is effective and heartrending.If you are a fan of the original material, please give this version of Cats a try. If you are not, this version won't make you one.",Cats

It's a strange musical, with a strange premise, with strange characters - why would the movie be any different? It was true to form. The musical numbers are fun and dramatic. The cats look weird, but that's to be expected, considering it's a bunch of adult actors playing cats. Enjoy the music and bizarreness of it all - it's kind of fun! Additionally, Jennifer Hudson is phenomenal! She didn't have to go that hard, but she did, and we should be grateful!",Cats

If you go to the movie with ridged expectations of the broadway performances you will be disappointed. However, if you go with childlike wonder, you will be blown away!I have been brought to tears several times. The casting was near perfection. Jennifer Hudson as Grizabella and Judi Dench as Old Deuteronomy couldn't have been better.Watching my teenage sons glued to the screen was priceless.

The entire movie feels messy because of the really really bad special effects, especially around the hands and faces of the background cats. But Universal said they're re-releasing with better effects so fingers crossed.Overall, I think you can enjoy the film if you ignore the nudeness and the effects. The songs are actually good, Jennifer Hudson and Taylor Swift performances are superb. The choreography is meticulous and so interesting to watch. The story is actually not as confusing as people say it is, it's just a very straight-forward fictional story.So enough with the negative reviews, like IT IS NOT THAT BAD!!",Cats

1882,rnshagam-204-865809,Why the hatred?,8,12 January 2020,"All I can think is that the modern audience must never have heard of TS Eliot, or had his poetry read in school. If people had only read the original poems in advance, maybe they'd know what a Jellicle cat is. I had a 3rd grade teacher who read Macavity the Mystery Cat to us almost weekly, and we loved it!! Maybe they don't teach this stuff any more. And, by the way, the Heaviside layer does actually exist--predicted by Oliver Heaviside, it is an ionized layer in the ionosphere. So TS must have known some atmospheric physics. Ok, school's out--now for the review:
Cats wasn't absolutely the best movie I had ever seen, but it certainly isn't worth all the negative reviews. I've seen the musical several times--once in a local community theater, and in the touring show, and the official video, so I think I'm qualified to compare this to the original staging--basically, it was a fun flick. The movie is visually sumptuous--lots of detail to look for. The plot, choreography, and character portrayal has, like in many stage to movie transfers is still quite satisfying, although I found the Macavity plot enhancement a bit forced. Note the billboards and business signage--it is very cat-centric. Details abound in the trash piles. Never mind that sometimes the scale of the sets and props relative to the cats' sizes may change. And why should anyone really care that some cats wear fur coats, as everything is all just fantasy, anyway. Some not-so-convincing singing, but Jennifer Hudson was a knockout singing Memory. And, yes, when I came home from the theater, I hugged my two kitties, knowing that they will never dance or sing like the folks in the movie, but still be loved.",Cats

1884,cinquo-220-86420,Cats Cats Cats!,1,23 December 2019,Cats is as bombastic as it is gut wrenching. Like an apple from the garden of Eden this movie starts something and ends it's quickly. Laborious and riveting at the same time the melancholy drawn from the main protagonists is both a sucker punch and kiss on the proverbial lips as this belter of a movie takes you to hell and back in the mere space of 1 hour 49 minutes which is far quicker than anyone could either climb Everest or climb to the bowels of this beastly planet which we call Earth.

1888,klblynn,Excellent!!,7,31 December 2019,"Although I am a big Broadway musical fan and have heard the soundtrack of Cats many times, I never knew the full plot. It was nice to go into the movie being familiar with the songs. Since I was familiar with the songs, I did note that some songs were not what they could of been, but overall they were very entertaining and even moving. During one song, I started off a little disappointed, but by the end of the song, enjoyed it very much. At a few points near the end, I got emotional and had chills. The plot line was very understandable for those who have never heard of it.
If you enjoy musicals, dance numbers, and Broadway-style solos, the movie is worth your time. It was a movie I would watch over and over and recommend to friends. Actors did a phenomenal job and obviously Jennifer Hudson was amazing. Quite a few ""new"" actors who did a wonderful job as well. Excited to see where they go in the future.",Cats

I don't think it deserves all the negative criticism it's getting.",Cats
1890,griso-63179,Really enjoyed it,8,16 May 2021,"Polarizing it seems
It revised the story, gave it a new viewpoint, a focal point of view that allowed it more of a sense of story than the stage show which is genuinely just a bunch of set pieces each with a self-contained story but with just the most cursory of narratives to set them within.It doesn't matter because Cats on stage is a visual, visceral spectacle, a riot of musical cats and athletic dance with it's own unique aesthetic.This was better, the addition of Victoria isn't just a good way to centre the film, Francesca Hayward's performance of her was really quite beautiful. Whenever she danced it stood out wonderfully against the overall dance style, it set her apart from the other ""cats"", which supported the narrative cleverly. Her face was quite exquisitely beautiful framed as it was by the CGI, but her facial expressiveness, that part of her acting was captivating.How can folks hate this movie for the CGI? It added animated tails and yes.... fur. Have you looked at a cat? They actually don't wear technicolour leotards. Hating this film for the fur is like hating Aliens because the Xenos have flat asses, hating Star trek because you don't like the view out of the portholes. If you can't stand CGI for it's own sake then watch the film of the stage show, for pity's sake don't pretend you weren't expecting cat people.Idris Elba did well, Judy dench was playing Judy Dench, Taylor Swift was just there for the musical number and it was a good performance - I like her better as a cat apparently. James cordon was awful and in future views of the movie I will be fast forwarding him but no surprises there. I thought Ian McKellen played age to the hilt but the character's style got lost to that. Rebel Wilson was not there to be cool or emotionally compelling and I thought played the part and the song she was given well. I wasn't keen on the part but there I take issue with Tom Holland, not Wilson.Griselda and ""Memories"" have always been the highspot of Cats for me but Jennifer Hudson took it in a new direction and I really didn't appreciate the changes. Previosly as a character Griselda has a sorrowful magnificence, a beautiful sadness, it's the point the ""story"" seems to pivot on. Hudson plays her as fearful and the cast respond to her not with sadness and pity for her fall but with spite for her condition. ""Memories"" is performed with a little of the wistful loss, but with anger and it kills the whole character for me. When the chandelier rose into the clouds, for me it wasn't with that sense of joy and redemption, it was more of a ""well, that happened"".The reviews here and elsewhere gathered a harsh and undeserved momentum, I'll be watching this movie again when I'm in the mood for dance.",Cats

If you don't know the story of Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats, I suggest you read it beforehand, it will make the characters easier to relate to. The music is good, the costuming is eye-catching and the dancing is outstanding. Jennifer Hudson's ( Grisabella) rendition of ""Memory"" brought tears to my eyes and as a singer who dislikes this song, because it is generally sung badly, Hudson nails it!

1893,Trozo2015,Missed opportunity or bad error of judgement?,2,5 January 2020,"It seems to me there is an unusually large amount of criticism for this film. Many moan about the minutiae such as the absence of any humans and why do some cats wear clothes and some not. These critics are simply missing the point which is that this film is a fantasy.And many bang on about the sexual undertones of this film. Really? I think those people need to get out more! Yes I was personally drawn to the feline beauty of Victoria the leading character, who wouldn't be, but other than that I think the actors were all trying to behave like cats do.And as for the criticism over the creepy CGI, well what do you want these characters to look like? They are people dressed up as cats, they are re-enacting a famous theatre production, I'm not sure the makers of this film could have done it any other way.But for all those vacuous criticisms, there is some real criticism that needs to be leveled at this film.I'm aware of the Cats musical but never saw it, I'm aware of Elaine Page's smash hit of the most famous song from that production. I have an inquiring mind and love to be entertained but I struggled to understand what was going on and I was completely left cold by the film other than that one famous and very emotional song towards the end.There is a complete and utter lack of any dialogue. A lot of the lyrics in the songs themselves are difficult to grasp or make sense of. And there really is a complete lack of a decent plot of any kind to involve the audience with. There's a lot of dancing, a lot of singing, a lot of mumbo jumbo talk, but that's about it. There is only so long that I can watch endless singing and dancing! My guess is that this film closely re-enacts the original stage show. If so, then I really do doubt I would like that stage show at all either to be honest. You can get away with a lack of a plot if the performance is filled with wonderful, memorable songs. Cats isn't.So who loves this film and gives it 10 stars? I think it must mainly be fans of the original musical. If you haven't seen that musical then possibly, like me, you will find this film version empty, baseless and only vaguely entertaining.I really do think that the makers of this film needed to think rationally about how best to take the original musical and depict it on the screen, if indeed that was a wise thing to attempt at all. However I think they were too romantically entwined with the original musical production to be objective as to what a modern day audience requires from a film. Films today are sophisticated with complex plots and timelines, we as the audience absorb that complexity with ease. Cats the film is so lacking in anything at all that could be called sophisticated. The music alone doesn't cut it. Making this film was either a missed opportunity or a bad error of judgement.",Cats
1894,maddyofesi,Two hours truly wasted,3,5 January 2020,"Boring. I almost fall asleep twice. The story makes no sens at all. I don't know the original musical but the songs were boring and half of it sounded like opera recitatives. Totally forgettable. The worst interpretation of ""Memories"" I have ever heard. And that is the only good song there. Does Jennifer Hudson can even sing?
To take the cast like that, people who can sing (well.. Hudson), dance, perform, act and make that dreadful piece... That takes real talent.

To me it was pure entertainment for the whole family. True no one gets blown up or slashed or tortured (except for the scene in the beginning when Victoria gets thrown out of a car.

1898,finnthewizard,Bland cinematography more insulting than the animation,1,4 January 2020,"""Memories"", the most famous CATS song, is a very sad song. It's sung by Grizabella as she sits alone, away from all the other cats.
So then why the bloody hell is the camera insisting on being so close to her face? At least give us some wide shots to convey loneliness! Or a simple crane-pull! ANYTHING! PLEASE!
The ""Tom Hooper"" formula of ""Extreme close-up, long-take to prove we're singing live"" completely obliterates any promise this film had for being something interesting and artistic, instead making it feel like a generic recording of a broadway production, and ironically a worse version than the one we got twenty years ago.I do have other issues;
Certain songs, I was internally yelling ""YOU'VE MISSED THE JOKE OF THE SONG"". For example, Gumbie Cat's gimmick is that she's lazy and fat during the day, but becomes posh and sophisticated at night. Here, Rebel Wilson is doing random slapstick with no hint of sophistication at all, making the entire joke of the song fail miserably.Mungojerrie and Rumpleteazer's song gets sped up for no reason, making it feel more like a rap than the bouncy tune it was prior, which sucks because the bouncy tune actually felt mischievous but playful, rather than this version which feels like diet-macavity, which is *not* what these cats are about.Speaking of, Macavity's supposed to be a duet. It sounds like it's missing half the song when only Taylor's singing, and by the time Idris jumps in it's already too late. I hadn't heard Macavity's theme in like a decade and was still able to tell it sounded fundamentally wrong; the ""punch"" of the song doesn't work with just one person singing one pitch....there's plenty more to bash this film for, but on the whole it's very clear that very little love and thought went into this film's screenplay; pretty much everything they change is for the worse.
And, as I stated, the flat cinematography alone is enough for me to classify this film as a failure from an artistic perspective.The only thing that's good is the set design, but of course that's wasted on a film like this.",Cats

The storyline is ridiculous as is the concept but allow yourself some escapism and enjoy the unbeatable songs and dance routines. Pros, Jennifer Hudson absolutely nails Memory, Francesca Hayward has the most beautiful cat face and exquisite dancing, Jason Derulo is a fun rum tum tugger and James Corden and Rebel Wilson provide something light hearted humour.
Cons: CGI is very obvious at some points in particular the opening scene, skimble shanks and the closing scene, some songs are sang in the wrong key and the bass and amplification of some songs don't pronounce it in the best way. Taylor Swift doesn't appear natural dancing as a cat (I know this is a ridiculous sentence even as I write it) but she appears awkward dancing, shoulders too high and stiff, the stupid shoes don't help.

1908,ezgiyaren,Okay hold your horses,7,1 June 2020,"If you stop seeing the whole movie with its CGI effects, I mean it's a musical where songs sang by cats what did you really expect, the movie is not bad. Even considerably a good one. I personally think cats having human features is a good touch since you can personalize all of them instead of seeing a bunch of animated Cheshire cats. In addition, you get to see beautiful modern dance and ballet performances specially from Francesca Hayward and Robbie Fairchild whole movie and Jennifer Hudson singing 'Memory' bring tears to your eyes. She took my breath away and honestly I felt the agony she's in throughout the whole song. Another highlight of the movie was Laurie Davidson singing Mr. Mistofellees, boy he's just right for the role. When you think all those Broadway triple-threats performing during shooting for real without film-editing, lip-syncing or play-backing, because Tom Hooper is a brilliant director, I think this movie is not deserve all those harsh comments that people throw without care. The only bad thing that happened to that movie was Rebel Wilson, James Corden and Jason Derulo was in it and I hate to think that it's because publicity because unfortunately all those great people in the cast are not Hollywood superstars and therefore people don't know who they are. Taylor Swift on the other hand a little more tolerable but still a disgrace when you think all those voices you could use with a song like that but well, I guess they are not well-known enough. Overall it was a good movie, not a great one tho but I enjoyed little details like instead of kissing, they were rubbing cheeks like cats and how they occasionally lifting their one leg up meaninglessly like cats do. So stop saying that you're seeing your own pet cat differently after seeing this movie because I have two cats and as far as my concern they are not remotely related with this movie and you should take your biased minds and witch hunt somewhere else.

On top of the multiple errors in the visuals, it was just plain terrifying imagine a human cat demon prancing about like a freak. Truly petrifying.  I wanted a SWIFT death with how uncomfortable and scared I was.I give two stars because Jennifer Hudson's singing is phenomenal and heartbreaking, if you can get past the horrible cat-ness.And the lead is an incredible dancer. Her talent is undeniable. It was genuinely stunning and mesmerizing, but unfortunately it couldn't save this nightmare.",Cats

I must admit before I went to see it I was worried how it would translate on screen. I have seen it twice on stage and it is one of my favourite shows. I really enjoyed the film, thanks to editing and CGI, more stunts and scene changes etc are allowed. And I enjoyed the change of macavity being the bad guy. I wonder if those giving bad reviews really understood the show? My advice is if you like musical theatre and enjoyed the stage version then go see the film.",Cats
1918,allenfinley,Laugh - Cry - Cheer,9,1 January 2020,"This is a beautiful production of one of the most successful musicals ever. Addition of some dialogue and one or two songs provides a clearer plot line than the original, but a traditional story is not the purpose of this production. This is NOT ""The Aristocats"". There have been complaints about incomplete superimposing of fur CGI, but I believe this produces a separation that lets us see cats as both surreal and mystical, and also not so different to us. Immerse yourself in this world, and you will laugh, cry, and cheer.Exceptional actors and performers bring a superb level of dance, performance, and song. In addition to icons like Judy Dench and Ian McKellen, and the vocal talents of Jennifer Hudson and Taylor Swift, there are multiple ""triple threats"" from musical theatre that movie audiences may not be as familiar with, notably Steven McRae as Skimbleshanks, Robbie Fairchild as Munkustrap, and of course James Corden as Bustopher Jones. And I can't close without mentioning the gorgeous performance by Francesca Hayward as Victoria, who ties the story together and channels the beauty and sensuality of ""cat"" like nothing I have ever seen.",Cats
1919,nezarembak,People who hate don't understand the background,9,8 January 2020,Unpopular opinion but I really liked Cats. The thing about this movies is that you have to understand that this came from musical theatre WHICH YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND WHEN YOU WATCH THIS!!! Otherwise of course you would think this is weird. In musical theatre kind of anything goes and the actors are mimicking the behaviors of cats which might make some people uncomfortable by once you get past that the plot is unique and the dancing and singing is wonderful.,Cats

It's a beautiful and wonderful movie, but not one for the majority. But wth, even on stage, Cats had never been something everybody can get.
Cats is a perfect musical with many hidden layers of meaning. You have to look deeper into the movie to see them, like European films. It is the perfect blend between a good story, great music and great dancing. My only complaint is that there could have been more long take, to let us see the wonderful dancing numbers better instead of those fast-pace short cuts. It's still wonderful by the way.
I didn't expect Cats to be everyone's cup of tea, I expected that people would give it an unfair rating of 5-6 star. But no, you guys have to go being prejudiced and give it a 1 star! That is so UNFAIR. The visual of this movie is a bit different, yes. The story is a bit different, yes. But those are good differences! People are too harsh and prejudiced against this movie because of how a few people reacted when the trailer first came out. Remember when everybody commented that the Cats movie trailer looked like a bad horror and give them nightmare? Even back then I thought the trailer was wonderful and people just pick on the movie because they saw other people react to it.
I rarely write review, but people are having such hostile reactions to this movie that I have to write this. Because to me, this movie is not the best, yes, but it's great, and I had a wonderful time watched it.",Cats

One of the most aggravating subjects to teach was music appreciation. It didn't matter what I exposed the children to they wouldn't even give the subject music a chance.This is where my review comes in. It isn't necessarily about Cats but about all of the ""1"" ratings it has received here on IMDb. I read about 30 of these bad reviews and it was like listening to a class of 6th graders trying to explain to me why they didn't like Fiddler On The Roof after the first 30 minutes. These reviews, in my honest opinion, were written by someone paid to write bad reviews, a middle schooler or someone with the mentality of one, or someone whose spirit isn't moved in the slightest by music, dance, art, or theater.I could go on but it would be pointless. Go see this film! It is a masterpiece of movie musicals! The song Memory was knocked out of the park by Jennifer Hudson. You might not give it a ""10"" (I did) but you will see that it deserves far better than the 2.6/10 rating it is currently receiving here.",Cats

So I think people reviewing it don't know the musical. Or they expected more..but they didn't change the musical and the musical IS effing weird. We just never noticed it because going to the theatre we transported and accepted the weirdness. If that makes senseIt was one of the first musicals I saw live and I'll never forget it.

Not even National Treasure Dame Judi Dench could save this film from the stain it has put upon the world. My friend and I went knowing it would be bad so we had a few drinks before. Not even my 3 glasses of wine could delude me into thinking it's a good film. The CGI was a joke, the special effects laughable, the acting was terrible and over the top (I expect this was the doing of Tom Hooper) and to top it all off every chorus had stray notes and no cohesive harmony. Nothing about this film was salvageable, a total wreck. EVERY MOMENT WAS CRINGEWORTHY! I literally cringed ON my cringes! What baffles me is that there were about 50 other viewers in the audience and no one walked out, no one shouted at the screen about how bad it was, no one besides us even cackled at the absurdity of the whole stanky mess.",Cats
1930,deanwatson-19404,Still remains a 'love or hate' show,8,20 December 2019,"Reading the slating it gets on here makes me think that all the 1 stars reviewers have never seen the Cats before. It's always been a 'marmite' production but for true theatre lovers, it's an epic representation of T.S Eliot's poems. The film brought more of a storyline to the show and the additional song slipped in nicely. Personally I found Jason Derulo disappointing and although Judy Dench was good in her role, I would have cast Brian Blessed as a nod to the original west end production, of nothing else than his wonderful performance of The Ad-dressing of Cats.
I'd say don't listen to the haters, give it a go with an open mind, you just might love it, if so then you live the theatre production even more!",Cats

I had a family, people who loved me as much as I loved them back. An amazing wife, 2 beautiful children and... I'm sorry but this is so hard to write... a cat. I thought despite the bad reviews and creepy previews that I could still find some joy in this movie as I have been able to find joy in many things in my life. However, I got ten minutes into the movie and my body wouldn't let me get up out of the chair, I was paralyzed as the horrible images, ear destroying songs, and dialogue that seemed to be written by a mentally challenged dodo bird was forced upon me. It has been several days since I left that theatre and I will not go into specific details, but my actions have lead to my family leaving me and my cat no longer being with us. Something has taken over my mind that I never though possible, there is such anger filling me that and I feel myself falling into a deep and dark hole with no chance of escape, even the thoughts of cats remind me of the horrors I faced in that movie theatre and there is nothing I can do to stop it. I fear that I will never be the same again, all I can hope is that my mind will repress the horrid memories that I have endured over the last couple days. I beg of anyone reading this... Do not watch this movie. Just leave a bad review and move on, trust me, it has ruined my life",Cats

1935,ailinon-13515,Better than most current film-musicals,8,22 January 2020,"So I finally watched ""Cats"". And I'm going to have a seemingly unpopular opinion: it's one of the better film-musicals made recently! I suspect that the thing that people have a problem is the ""uncanny valley"". Well...
I am familiar with the stage musical (and a video-version of it) since I was a kid, really. And I do like it, I used to dance to it in front of a TV and had a small poster by my desk.
And I should also probably say, that I always treated it similar to sci-fi or fantasy. Because it is! It is set in a world, where there are humanoid cats. And magic. They are not cats that we know. They are alien cats. They walk on two legs, have human-like faces and like singing and dancing. And some of them can do magic.
Going into the film with this (to me very obvious) assumption, their look is just a given.The SGI is... mostly good. The only problem is that they are often a bit ""floating"", not quite standing on the ground. Slightly distracting, but not majorly. Were the Composite artists rushed in the end to they didn't have time to fix this? I suspect so.Story is, in my opinion, very much improved. There is now an ""audience perspective"" character - a new cat, Victoria, so we can discover this world of ""jellicle cats"" with her and follow her journey. A few other characters are fleshed out: Mr. Mistoffelees has a visible story ark, Gus the Theatre Cat has an awesome resolution instead of just disappearing after his song, it is explained why everyone hates Grisabella, and Macavity has a reason for lurking around and disrupting the ball beyond ""because he's eeeeevil"".
The only thing I missed compared to the stage version was a bad-ass fight between Munkustrap and Macavity. Because that made Munkustrap into a real badass. Actually, I'd say his character was slightly toned down overall. He is more of a guide, rather that a leader and protector. I personally liked the stage version more, but this is just a personal preference here.The humour is also mostly good, a lot of funny moments, more than in the original.The actors are good. Really, really good, actually. Especially Mistoffelees (Laurie Davidson).
I mean, everyone. But... yeah, in this version the Magical Cat leaps from ""one of the favourites"" to ""the favourite"" character. (In the stage-version-video Munkustrap overshadowed him a bit for me).Oh, and... they can sing! I know, there shouldn't be a reason to mention this in a musical. It seems obvious that the actor should be able to both sing and act (and dance in this case) at the same time to be cast in a musical. But the recent track record for ""films-musicals"" has been... not so good. Well... there you go.",Cats
1936,katielindconnor,Exactly what I expected,10,11 December 2020,"I definitely wasn't disappointed! A life long fan of the play. I was first introduced to the play when I was 5, seeing it live at the Kennedy center. Then we named our cats Macavity & Jennyanydots. The play released on VHS, watched it 100x! The movie brings those sets to life. Casting was perfect! Don't compare the movie to the play, nor to an actual movie. Because then you will be disappointed. It's not entertaining in the way of plot and dialogue. However seeing the songs I grew up loving come to life, well that was a treat. Plus my name is Kat and ""Meow, Meow"" is like my ""Aloha"". So watching Idris Elba say ""meow"" tickles me in a special way. Watch it to enjoy seeing the cats you love sing those songs that pull on your heart strings.

I'm very forgiving for many movies. I disagree with most ""critics"" and generally pretty forgiving if a movie tries to be good, but good lord this movie ignored every instinct, every spirit or soul this story has to tell.
Everything could've been bearable, but this director is tone deaf artistically. The music and voice direction is soo bad. The characters looked so awful. The soundtrack was COMPLETELY SOULLESS. What the Hell? How could this movie make it so far into production without anyone saying anything? F'ing travesty and not worth my time. Les miserables was a fluke. Director probably got lucky then.

The only issue we noticed were with the CGI whiskers but perhaps unsurprisingly, that wasn't top of our viewing priorities.

I soon realised, about 20 mins in, that there is no solid storyline, and perhaps it translates better on stage than the big screen. However, I loved it. The performances were amazing, I loved the dancing, and J Hud was outstanding, I was sobbing by the end. It's just one bizarre musical number after another.Secondly, the CGI really isn't as awful as people are making it out to be. Some bits looked a little off, but it wasn't distracting at all. In fact, at times, it was glorious to look at. The set designs were beautiful, and the way the actors moved was captivating.I can see why people may not like this movie, it's definitely not to everyone's taste, but it's not a bad movie by the time you judge talent and direction.

The 2019 film has some good moments, but there were several really, really bad ones too.It's hard to make a movie out of a book of poems that have a theme but not a story. I get that. I like that there is something of a story in this movie - more so than the stage production.The highlights for me:
Skimbleshanks and his number. The dance was quite different from the stage show, and I liked it.Taylor Swift's number ""Macavity"" was great!I liked that the relationship between Mr. Mistofelees and Victoria was developed more than in the stage show.The parts I was not fond of:
Bustopher Jones. This was a complete mess. The acting did not match the lyrics in the least. Bustopher Jones is meant to be a posh, well-groomed, kind of stuffy cat. Not the food-crazed glutton he was made into here.Mungojerrie and Rumpleteazer's song was completely ruined. Monotone works for rapping, not for this.There's more that I could say, but those are the major pieces I came away with. Four stars for it being bad but not a complete train wreck.",Cats

1960,dietzmanuela,"Cats - poetic background, music, dance",8,5 January 2020,"This film for me is a good transformation from the original Cats material into the technical media of film. I prefere the musical version and live experience. But I totally found the spirit of the poems, music and dance also in the movie.
If people cannot handle lyrics/poetic language, slow stories where the focus lies more on character and to draw them, then on action and obvious plaine story lines...perhaps for those this film is not the right thing to see. But if you are a cineast. If you like the special dimension of 'feeling' a film. If you can laugh about human characters and sillyness reflected in a special world of Cats. Then you will enjoy this film. And yes... I got remembered to all my memories of when I saw the musical on stage many times as a child and teenager. And yes, perhaps the film does not work with this background? But I see the hard work and creativity the team put in this transformation. Changes to the story to offer more dynamic, changes in the songs and also there is the great and correct decision to go with the poetic language and tone.
Last but not least the technical effort. The film version I saw was impressive...one small sample: just watch e.g. the cat fur, waving in a slight wind perfectly done.
Do not watch this film if you do not like the music, dancing and if you do not like poetic texts. For lovers of phantasy worlds, listeners of the word and dreamer in music this film is recommended. Just to enjoy, and not to ask for the whole sense of life.",Cats
1961,cminmalaysia,Genuinely loved this!,9,29 December 2019,"Like many, I was nearly put off going to see this because of the negative response from the media but I'm also known for wanting to form my own opinion. I genuinely thought it was brilliant!
I have seen the stage show a couple of times and I think this is perhaps key. The fact that it's humans dressed as Cats is really not the issue the press try to tell you it is. After all, this is how it is on the West End. The cinematography is fantastic and I found the storyline so much easier to follow than on the stage.
It's understandable that it won't suit everyone but I can guarantee that if you love musicals, maybe know a couple of the songs, you will not be disappointed.
The only odd bit was near the end when Idris Elba (Macavity) took off his coat and I found myself looking for his furry bits 😆

My depression has disappeared, I have a spring in my step, I don't want to drink the arsenic anymore. I no longer think of reaching for my gun. All my thoughts of death have been replaced by dancing cockroaches, Gandalf hissing, James Corden's gutter alley feast, and Taylor Swift... oh my.

It brings the theatre to my living room!It is disappointing to see the bad reviews and some of the actors bad mouthing the movie because of its reviews. The reviews about the CGI and the fact they have normal hands make no sense...I'm not sure what they expected....paws??

The graphics looked so weird on the actors it's was distracting. My mother was ready to leave before the movie ended. It was just a terrible movie all together.,Cats

So with an open mind I went and watched Cats and loved every minute. I have not watched the musical in the theatre so have nothing to compare it with even if you can. My advise if your in two minds go watch it and make your own mind up,Cats
1977,itsmefaith,Ignore the reviews and decide for yourself,10,4 January 2020,"I love musicals and was always disappointed that this was one I never had the chance to see on stage. I don't care about reviews. I like to make my own decision but I was apprehensive about paying a lot of money to see this with so many negative reviews. After seeing it I wanted to turn around and see it again. I loved pretty much everything about it. The music was wonderful, the performances were fantastic. Jennifer Hudson's version of Memories was amazing and James Corden and Rebel Wilson were hilarious. I feel like a lot of the reviews were younger people wanting to see a lot of Taylor Swift and I personally am happy that her part was minimal. She's definitely not the reason I wanted to see it and if she's the big draw oh, then you might be disappointed. Ignore the reviews and decide for yourself.",Cats

Having read a bunch of reviews I was really worried it was going to be bad. Was it perfect? No! But was it worth all the 1 star reviews? Absolutely not!If you're going to compare it to the stage show, it's never going to live up to your expectations. It's adapted for a different audience and I thought they did a great job!The CGI really wasn't that bad! It could have been better and felt a bit rushed, but it isn't deserving of all the hate!The cast did a great job, but the one thing I didn't like was Dame Judy Dench as Old Deuteronomy. I love her in almost everything but she really should stay away from singing. She brought nothing to it for me. If you're going to complete change the character, make sure you've got someone who can carry it off!",Cats
1979,bkleblanc-89267,Don't believe the negative hype..it's not that bad,7,26 December 2019,"While I think the movie did miss a few marks and had areas of improvements, there are several shining moments and IS entertaining.My two biggest complaints are: the CGI-imposed faces and Jason Derulo's Rum Tum Tugger.Overall, I was ok with the hybrid human/cat characters but the faces often looked like they were misplaced in the head, a technical glitch one would assume was fixable.Jason Derulo is very talented, but this Rum Tum Tugger really had zero charisma. I think he was cast as a result of some sort of equation that factored name recognition/ talent/cost. An unknown that ""popped off the screen"" would've been better.Jennifer Hudson, Ian McKellen, and Judi Dench all had wonderful performances. Francesca Heyword and her character were perfect guides to the world of Jellicle cats.Taylor Swift, James Corden, and Rebel Wilson all gave good performances. Not award-winning in my view, but certainly very good for what their parts required.The rest of the main casts are relatively unknowns but all performed very well. I especially liked Laurie Davidson's Mr. Mistoffelees.I thought the lighting and cinematography was breathtaking; and the dance numbers ranged from ""just ok"" to ""pretty cool"".I've seen Cats on Broadway, at a casino, a relatively large auditorium, a local theater group, and a London Thereafter recorded stage performance filmed in the 80s or 90s, and I would rate this movie as the 2nd or 3rd most enjoyable. The Broadway , Winter Gardens, was the best and the local Theater Group was 2nd but movie was much better than the others.I think the piling on of bad reviews is unjustified and probably more of a result of a sort of mob mentality rather that of mass of movie goers who are genuinely appaled but this film.",Cats
1980,MadMovieHag,"Screw everyone, I enjoyed this movie.",5,29 December 2019,"Yes, this is a goofy ridiculous movie, but that was why the musical was so loved and it does not deserve the amount of butthurt the plebs and snobs are giving it. Real criticism: They cut a whole scene and some characters. The new song beautiful ghosts, seemed really shoved in. Added scenes, like on Growltiger's boat, were incredibly silly. Theater people say the choreography was changed. On the plus side, I loved the colorful neon 1930s London setting. I loved the synthesizers in the score. I loved the weird illogical moments, they were surreal and mesmorized me. I'm more than happy to go see something weird while everyone else is pushing out formulaic ""safe"" stuff. As for the look of the cats I had no problem with it, and frankly, was more than happy to see Idris Elba's dancing silhouette. It was no more weird than the Cowardly lion in the Wizard of Oz.

1989,jenniferlipka,Disappointed,2,23 December 2019,Well.... it was painfully long for such a short movie. The numbers were good. Taylor Swift was great as was Rebel Wilson. It just needed maybe some more excitement or substance or something. It just didn't move quick enough for me to enjoy it. I kept wondering when and wishing for it to be over. The acting was great. This was all down to the script and editing.,Cats
1990,thomasltanner,Don't believe the hate!!!,7,23 December 2019,"Think for yourselves and go see this movie. I personally enjoy musicals and went to see this to enjoy a musical with my daughter and wife. I went prepared to see why everyone thought it was so awful but I must have watched a different movie because I found it mostly enjoyable. I think the problem is most are going to just hate on the movie for some reason. If you go looking for something find wrong with the film, sure, you will find plenty of items. But why go spend $10 on a ticket for that. I personally go to be entertained and that is what I was delivered. The songs are pretty good (my fave is Mr. Mestofelees) and the dancing is sublime. James Corden and Rebel Wilson weren't my favorite and Judi Dench was not a great casting choice but the rest of the cast was great. Jennifer's high notes will give you chills, Taylor nails MaCavity, and Francesca was exquisite. Yes, the CGI was not great, but is was no worse than The Hobbit, and I didn't see everyone so up in arms about that. Go see this for what it is and have a great time!!",Cats
1991,alovechambers,Not worth it!,2,27 December 2019,"Just terrible. The graphics, and storyline.

1992,jgsherry-65217,What did everyone expect,9,1 January 2020,"Having seen the stage play I thought this was good. The stage play had very little plot and was carried by the music and dancing.

We all enjoyed watching the movie.",Cats
1993,emulcaster,Watch the stage version first.,7,23 December 2019,"As a massive fan of the musical, I thoroughly enjoyed this adaptation.
It stayed true to the stage version for the most part and the music was brilliant.
I'm not the biggest fan of some of the names (Corden, Swift, Derulo) and was a little skeptical on seeing the trailers but they don't feature as much as promotion would suggest.
Hudson was brilliant.I had a little giggle leaving the movie and hearing the opinion of everyone else..
""that was just weird... Why where they dancing?..... Didn't realise there was so much singing""..Definitely watch the stage version first.",Cats

1997,Erialc4,I thoroughly enjoyed it,9,1 January 2020,"This movie does not deserve to be panned.I found it quite beautiful. You have to know it is an adaptation from a musical which was inspired by a quirky collection of poems about cats.I think maybe a lot of reviewers didn't understand this. And I didn't think it was fair that many walked out after 30 mins or 1 hour and still felt within their rights to leave a review.There are some changes from the original musical to give it more of a plot but essentially it is a song and dance spectacle. I found it entertaining and moving and it gave those familiar with Cats a different angle on the work.It is not a masterpiece, the CGI may be wanting, but if you go into the movie with an open mind, I don't see why one can't enjoy it. Frances Hayward and Jennifer Hudson were amazing in their roles and the other cast members were good too.I can see why some people were uncomfortable with it. The musical didn't really have speaking in it. The plot isn't immediately apparent. It is definitely not your typical Hollywood movie. But I think people are too quick to diss what they're not used to.",Cats

Not the most catchy of songs but does contain a couple of foot tapping songs which I enjoyed. In my opinion it deserves much more than the reviews it has received. It really is down to personal taste. It's a thumbs up from me. Even my 83 year old mother enjoyed it.

2003,joeydarco,Cats The Movie is impeccably fine 👌🏼,10,30 December 2019,"Cats The Movie was impeccably fine 👌🏼 The fantasy of the world, the talent of the actors and dancers, the effort and authenticity was superb. I had no issue with the CGI fur as they were humans playing cats. It was cool because it was as if we were watching an on stage production but the actors transformed into cats. I read people complaining saying ""I shouldn't have to question wether the actor is a man or a woman ... um okay well... male cats and female cats alike are both sultry, mysterious, curious and pretty smooth. I think that society was taken back by the film because it is so different than anything done before on a theater screen. The plot was spot on. As cats have 9 lives and don't have the misfortune of suicide it was an humbling look at what a fantasy world where moving on and being reborn is a desirable goal. Overall the movie was charming, Francesca, the lead ballerina from the Royal Ballet was astounding in her role. The amount of talent in this film in inspiring. The ballads, the set, the choreography... I give cats a 10/10. The hatful reviews are true to the ones writing it but many people don't remember that this is an on stage musical that had been adapted to the big screen. If you left the film early, are avoiding it because of others opinions or are just unfamiliar with creative mastery coming to cinema, then I suggest you give it a second go 👍🏼",Cats
2004,jcoopermarsh,Really good!,9,30 December 2019,"The movie started weird but you got used to it after a while. I loved it!

The latter parts were sufficiently moving to give me goosebumps. So, what's not to like? Nothing.

2017,pontesantunes,Its not a miserables but not a failure also.,5,28 January 2020,"Well, yeah the cgi wasnt perfect and the cats with human faces were just weird to begin with. But I have watched worse. In more recent and better classified movies. Deeper in the movie, it became acceptable. Almost normal. There were some good choreography
and singing. It was different. In a all new level.It's not a 2/10 movie, but in my opinion more of an 5/10. Hudson sounded unbelievable, her acting was amazing. Swift's cameo was fresh. And Wilson and Corden were themselves literally but it just kinda make everything glued back together.Of course, everybody always jumps to attack what's not so expected right now, and the cats got they bullseye.",Cats

Yes it has its flaws. I couldn't get my head around the fact they had human hands and some had shoes on. But if you have enough imagination it is fantastic and the dancing is just brilliant to watch.

2021,lucascrossley,Pretty poor,3,21 December 2019,I only watched it because I felt I needed to see it to believe how bad it is. I didn't hate it anywhere near as much as I thought I would but it was still pretty terrible. I was going to give it a 4 to try and be slightly positive but I couldn't think of a quality that would be worthy of a 4/10 rating so just stuck with 3. James Corden is the worst. Jason derulo's English accent is almost as bad as don cheadle's in Oceans 11. The graphics looked entirely ridiculous. I just don't know who saw the stage version and thought it would translate well to film. It doesn't. It's also really boring and I tried to power through but left after about an hour. The only positive was the music but I guess the film had nothing to do with that really. James Corden is the worst.,Cats

I was very curious about the movie with an amazing cast including Judi Dench, Taylor swift, rebel Wilson, Ian McClellan, janes cordon qand especially Idris Elba. Unfortunately I found it boring and almost unwatchable. It was super creepy and bizarre. The CGI was at best weird and at worst deeply disturbing .

2027,Kraven101,I have seen Cats and I must scream.,2,8 January 2020,"I have seen Cats and I must scream.I walked away from The Rise of Skywalker disappointed. I walked away from Marriage Story tearful and hopeful. I walked away from Knives Out feeling like I'd just gotten off a rollercoaster.But when I walked away from Cats, it was in...well, not in shock, exactly, but in a sort of numbed but intensely unsettled acceptance of the eldritch horrors birthed by the people behind this thing.I had never noticed before how...horror-ish the music is in Cats, at least not until those uncanny shadows began swarming over the screen towards a wriggling bag, or when they began feasting ravenously upon the contents of a back-alley garbage can, or when Rebel Wilson's Jennyanydots UNZIPPED HER SKIN AND ATTACKED HER CAPTOR WITH IT.Ahem.Forevermore will I see the name T.S. Eliot and think, ""tf, Eliot?!"" Forevermore will I connect Andrew Lloyd Webber not with the slightly ugly but talented Phantom, but with Gus the Theatre Cat (an impressively but confusingly dedicated Ian McKellen), complaining in song about how the theatre is dying because it's not like it used to be. Forevermore will I attempt to get #whatthehellicleisajellicle trending.Also, how dare Jennifer Hudson make me care? How dare she give me chills unrelated to the unnatural feline slithering of her co-stars or Taylor Swift's cat knockers or Rebel Wilson's army of anthropomorphic cockroaches? (Sidebar: Said cockroaches even had the very slight potential to be charming if presented like, say, Kenan Thompson in SNL's ""Diner Lobster"" sketch, but ""missed opportunity"" is the only theme I was able to pull from this thing, so this tracks.)Cats have nine lives. Cats the movie has used one on its devastating theatrical release (making back only about half its budget at the time of writing) and will use its second on its streaming/home video release. This leaves it with seven lives-one for each circle of hell, so we're covered there. I just want to know which level you go to for making Idris Elba in a skintight velvet catsuit something to be feared. (Probably the sixth: heresy. And they'll disappear with a ""MEOW!"" and a *poof!*) To be fair, when I heard they were pushing out a patch to fix and/or finish the visual effects in Cats, my immediate thought was, ""Turns out your movie here is only mostly dead,"" so this thing may still be reborn into our consciousness in the coming years.Oh, my Eternal Cat...this is the Heaviside Layer, isn't it? We're all going to be reborn as half-human, half-feline monstrosities, aren't we? When we stare into the void, Judi Dench stares back and lectures us about how cats are not dogs.I sincerely hope this movie finds a place alongside other ""bad movie night"" classics like The Room and The Rocky Horror Picture Show, because...oof. If it doesn't belong there, it doesn't belong anywhere. Go dance with those beautiful ghosts, Cats...or remain a bad memory.Two litterboxes out of ten.",Cats

Some excellent performances from the cast, notably Jennifer Hudsons emotional performance of memories, was worth the ticket price on it's own. This film does not deserve the bad press.

I totally believed that these were some sort of human cat hybrid! Better movie than Joker! The story was so deep! I always thoughts were dogs until this movie opened my eyes. Now every time I go home to my cat, I bow down to it. Cats are everything and this movie gave me a brand new perspective. We can stop making movies now. Nothing can top this! That $95M was put to good use! What a spiritual experience! Love love love this beautiful movie. Can't wait for the sequel!

I was freaking out and tried to watch Toy Story 4, but it made me really sad and emotional. Two or three hours into the trip though, I managed to click on ""Cats"". The colours looked amazing. It carried me through the rest of it. I couldn't look away. The cat people are trippy and strange looking but funny to watch and the songs make no sense, but it was perfect - it was as if we had all agreed to participate in this madness together. Nothing made sense but somehow that was alright. I don't think I will ever watch this movie again but I will never forget how the Jellicle cats (I don't know what it means) got me safely through.

2035,kreativesauce,"Less critical, more understanding....",8,21 December 2019,"As a watcher of this film without a need to follow the media critics, I found this film very enjoyable. Yes, at first I thought the faces on CGI graphics a little quirky, but I saw through to the joy of what Cats is meant to be. A celebration of T. S. Eliot's feline friends. No, it's not perfect (yes I resisted), but it is a homage on the silver screen. Dame Judy Dench and Sir Ian McKellan are delightful; the young upstarts maybe don't capture the spirit of Cats the musical because unlike those above, the stage is not in their blood. This is ultimately what this has to be, a stage show on the silver screen. It was always going to fail in one respect; it's not the on the stage! What it does do is introduce the characters to a younger generation through their stars, such as Jason Derulo and Taylor Swift. It also gives access to those who don't usually go to shows on stage. For this I applaud the creators of this film, maybe they knew they might get a verbal hiding by the press and stage aficionados. See this film through innocent eyes, and you are in for a treat!",Cats
2036,marisailiakis,Exactly What I Expected,6,30 December 2019,"I love how absolutely the stage musical of Cats is, and the film adaptation perfectly recreates that. Loved the dancing. Hated the cockroaches with faces. The Judi Dench monologue at the end made me lose my mind laughing. I saw this stoned on edibles and I can not recommend seeing it any other way. I also recommend at least reading what the musical is about so you don't go into the film assuming it will have a solid plot. An absolutely ridiculous film and the cast is clearly enjoying every minute of the insanity. If you can get past the uncanny valley of the dang animation and just enjoy the ride, you'll have a good time. I cannot say I was bored at any point in the movie.

It stays fairly faithful to the musical and includes the gorgeous music that made Cats so iconic. A little dodgy CGI in a few places but that doesn't detract from the story being told. Jennifer Hudson shines as Grizabella and Judi Dench makes a great Old Deuteronomy. Francesca Hayward's debut is fantastic too and she showcases her balletic talent in some well choreographed numbers.

I love it so much!!!! I grew up listening to the music, i knew all of it, i watch the play all over again. I was so THRILLED to hear the music at the Cinema! It sounds so GREAT!! - And i actually must admit that the moral of the ""story"" is more deep and interesting here than in the play. The purists may hate some of the changes, but it could it be worst. it could be animated (that would be so much of a mistake, even if the animation was intended to be quailty).In the last 15 years you have eaten the worst of the CGI for the sake of the fantasy in way awful movies. Don't come here and cry because of it because the music, the actors and the art design does'n t deserves it. The music and sound mix is wild!

-I like that the movie gave it the ability to change settings when necessary
-I didn't enjoy all of the singing (some were great, some not so much)
-not sure why Macavity can apparate himself and others but Idris Elba was just as fantastic as I expected him to be
-Skimbleshanks' song was my favorite number
-""Old Gumbie Cat"" has always been my favorite song in the musical but I didn't like Rebel Wilson as Jenny Anydots
-Jennifer Hudson singing ""Memory"" made me cry
-Dame Judi Dench was great as Old Deuteronomy
-I was VERY pleased with TSwift's performance of Macavity's song
-yes the CGI was pretty weird but so much of a cat's expression is in their ear and tail movements and the CGI gave that to us

Took the family to see cats just before Christmas. I had read the reviews so my expectations were not high. How bad is this movie on every level, there is little to no story or character building.
It was bad to the point of uncomfortable to watch, four people walked out after ten minutes but considering there was about twelve of us watching that's a pretty high percentage in anyone's book.
Keep your money and don't bother as I can guarantee with hand on heart that you will be disappointed.

It is there to justify the fact that this is a movie, because real costumes would have simply replicated the stage play.In summary, given that this exists - it probably shouldn't - then it is what I expected.

It's actual rating should be around 7-8 of 10. It is a muscle with great choreography and fantastic music. It is not an Oscar candidate but hell, how emotional it could get (especially if you understand the message of abandonment and loneliness, not only for cats or other pets but also for people). I really love Memories as a song and it was always emotional on me but when it was performed in this movie I was fighting to stop my tiers (which is the effect they wanted to achieve) and only for this moment the movie earns its 10/10 score from me!

Cons: I'm not crazy about the significantly-altered Mungojerry and Rumpleteaser nor Dame Judy D as Old Deuteronomy (I liked the idea of it, but it was actually quite difficulty to watch). Everything else is just great.It should be noted that if this is your first experience with Cats, know ahead of time that it's been around a long time to much acclaim and record-setting popularity. It is unique and definitely offbeat even by Broadway standards. And no, it is not for everybody. I saw a production of it very young and have grown up with the characters and the soundtrack, as have several of my friends. When my friend Lyndsey has enough to drink she sings every word to the Gumby Cat song, and I join in. This movie is for us. You are not always the target audience.

It's the first use of this technology in this way. For some reason it got rushed out and sent in unfinished. I found it frustrating because there are some brilliant dance and vocal performances in here, and I never knew what was real talent and what was cgi and what was real talent being clumsily pasted over with CGI. But it was clear that everyone involved was committed 100 percent.It's insane that this exists at all. Imagine pitching and funding and shooting and editing this monster of stitched-together set pieces. It's like a Berkeley Busby musical generated by one of those deep mind AIs.

If you haven't seen Cats at the theatre then you're not going to get it as it is an odd concept (still love it) so they're reaching a very niche market hence why the reviews haven't been great, sadly.

2059,babyc-90773,Gave my kids a good laugh,5,23 December 2019,"Although the CGI and costume design was insanely creepy, the actors did a fabulous job. Francesca is an amazing dancer and her training clearly shines! I was a little disgusted by Rebel Wilson's opening scene, but she had a small roll and gave a comedic air that was needed. James Corden also helped bring humor to a much needed dragging storyline. Jennifer Hudson absolutely owned her character. When she sang Memories at the end we all had tears. What a powerful voice! Dame Judi Dench was a joy. Her ending monolog kept us giggling as cat owners. Idris Elba has such a hypnotic yet creepy voice in this, however, I could not stand how he looked in full character. The CGI was off which leads to what brings this movie down. The horrible character design. What the heck are they supposed to be?? I know they were meant to be cats, but looked like a weird cat/human hybrid or just some crazy furries who might be a little too into it. I heard the original idea was to make this movie an animation and they should have stuck to that idea. My kids were cracking up at the fact the characters were in a body suit with cat patterns, cat ears, yet had human hands and feet. At one point my son loudly laughed and said ""hands"" when one of the characters held up an item. Why do not full cat costume? That would have looked better than the body suit, CGI ears and tails, and fur coats.
Again, I can't fault the actors for such a poor plotline and bad costume design. They owned their characters beautifully. Everything else about the movie though was very poorly done. Honestly, if you read this before purchasing tickets I would recommend holding off. I wish we had just saved our money and watched it when it came out on cable.",Cats

Of course it comes across a little weird, but if you give it a chance, it'll draw you in.Francesca Hayward is perfectly cast as the initially timid Victoria, and Jennifer Hudson, unsurprisingly, gives an emotional and powerful singing performance.Some excellent performances. The acting is superb, the singing and dancing are wonderful, the cgi is top notch. Very imaginative and firmly rooted in a fantasised version of the world we live in.No film is perfect, nor will it be everyone's cup of tea, but why condemn so harshly and ruin the impressions of others, and the efforts of artists working towards a unified vision?

2075,brunniepoo-72837,"Nice adaptation, but with too much stars",7,24 December 2019,"Reading all the online reviews, you might think Cats is a terrible movie. It isn't.I'm a fan of the musical, so I was looking forward to this adaptation for the big screen. I haven't been disappointed.First of all, the main problem with the musical is that it completely lacks a plot. Not much of a problem on stage, but it would have been on screen. An extra storyline was invented (Victoria) and that really helped in giving the scenes some coherence.
Most scenes were quite nice, with London as a background for the singing and dancing. Especially Skimbleshanks on one of London's railway bridges was a great scene. The dancing was quite alright, although the special effects (the cat leaping) were below par.The main problem - and in that some of the negative reviews are quite right - is the choice of actors. Robbie Fairchild and Francesca Hayward were great, but this movie would have been a lot better without all the famous actors. James Corden can sing and act, but he made his character Bustopher Jones into a James Cordon-character. Rebel Wilson was just plain annoying.
Judi Dench and Ian McKellen are great actors - in this movie as well, but shouldn't have been casted in a musical. Especially Dench brought some awkward singing and it's hard to imagine she was the best choice for this role.
Of all the big stars involved, only Taylor Swift managed to do some good singing and dancing without turning her Cat-character into an extension of herself.The choices of actors lead to some annoying moments, but overall Cats was a nice movie.

What made Cats on the Stage amazing is that the makeup and dancing/ballet was real. They were actually doing every lift and pirouette you see, as well as convincing acting and costumes that are believable. In this film, you will find bad CGI, where there faces look like they're floating over a head. With CGI, anyone can be a ballet dancer. It's filled with weord back and forth casting.

2081,contact-48440,Somehow manages to miss the point of Cats,4,10 February 2020,"While the Broadway show of Cats is dismissed by many as trifling, it does manage to have a semblance of a point: a community of characters, young and old, with its cliques and its cruelties, ceremoniously assert their identities and practice celebrating their differences in an audition for salvation. In the end, the cat who has suffered the most is chosen, and they unite in their communal identity, as cats.This movie kicks off its misunderstanding of this simple idea from its first character piece. In the stage show, Jennyanydots defies cat-ly expectations with her industriousness and motherly compassion for mice and beetles. In the movie, the character tortures and randomly eats her charges, and is otherwise undifferentiated from other selfish preening cats. Instead of a community of outcasts and misfits that come together, the cats in the movie are mostly unpleasant vandals unmoved by these stories. Even the slight and sappy tale of Grizabella, the only real arc in the original, is robbed of meaning and feels more random than compassionate. The final invocation to the audience is played directly to the camera in close up (!) and makes no effort to show the group as having matured from, or even having participated in, a communal ritual.I had hoped to at least enjoy Andy Blankenbuehler's choreography. Instead, the hyperactive and intrusive camera and visual effects demote the movement from its own emotional language to just another visual effect. The music is fully present, but that was never the show's strongest suit.I'm sorry Cats: The Movie is unable to properly introduce new audiences to the quirky and wholesome source material.

I've seen it 4 times on broadway. This creation was a pile of crap left in the litter box. The songs were crap and the acting was worse. We had to leave after they destroyed mongojeri and Rumpleteasers song. Just save time and money and stick needles in your eyes. Ugh hated this movie so much.,Cats

2085,jalynne-24305,A great movie for musical fanatics. Get over the cgi hair.,10,21 December 2019,"Loved it. I also loved the musical. If you hate/don't understand the musical, this isn't going to magically change your mind. CATS is supposed to be a dance spectacle. It is what it is. It's supposed to be weird because it's about people playing cats with a very loose plot. Now the movie gives us a more complete plot without rearranging the musical, which I thought was nice for the most part. YES THE CGI CAT HAIR IS WEIRD AND IF YOU HATE IT SO MUCH SO THAT IT RUINS THE MOVIE FOR YOU DONT SEE IT. ITS WEIRD OH WELL. But after awhile you just get used to how they are ""dressed.""
Overall the movie was fun and really well done. It's exactly what you expect. It's CATS the movie musical. The more you hate it, the more it gives power to the jellicle cats to go to the heavyside layer. Thank you.",Cats
2086,mastergreyco,"My wife and I just saw Cats, and you know what? IT ROCKS!",10,24 January 2020,"Forget the critics. Forget the reviews. Forget everything you've read about it. (Except this. But of course, you haven't read it yet, right?) Go see it with an open mind and form your own opinion.(Do not do what one person did: take a bunch of mushrooms, see the movie, and have a really bad experience. I suspect they would have gotten the same reaction seeing ""The Wizard of Oz"" in that condition.)The biggest complaint about it is ""OMG, cats with human faces, that's weird!"" Now admittedly, I have spent a lot of time in places where people wear cat ears and tails. But I found the effect more ""realistic"", if I can stretch the word that far, than the traditional people in cat suits and cat makeup.So what are some of the other criticisms I've read? And I'll forewarn you, I think most of them are bogus.""OMG, they changed the beloved choreography!"" Yeah, they did. They were freed from the boundaries of a physical stage, so they could expand dance numbers beyond its limitations. And of course, with CGI there really aren't any limitations.""OMG, they added a new musical number!"" Yeah, they did that too. So what? Do some research on the history of musicals. Productions change with the time, the location, and the medium. Songs and dances get dropped, new songs and dances get added. When ""Show Boat"" was revived on Broadway about 10 years ago, they looked back and picked all the best numbers from previous productions.""OMG, there's no real story, it's just a bunch of disconnected songs."" Have you read the book? Have you seen it on stage? That's what it is... cats telling their stories.""OMG, they added some dialog and some bits about Macavity!"" Are you the same one who was just complaining that there was no plot? Some people are never satisfied.""OMG, they had scenes with the cats in a house and they were cat-sized!"" Did you think the previous productions were about giant human-sized cats? Remember the part above about what can be done with CGI? They could put cats in a house, so they did, and they did something completely insane and made them cat-sized.""OMG, they -"" Give it a break already! You people torpedoed a really good movie with your baseless complaints.Now back to The Big Problem. Is the CGI perfect? No, because they rushed production so they could get the movie out in time to qualify for the Oscars.
Is it a good movie? I think so. I think it's a great musical, and it's an incredible technical accomplishment.I hope they take the time to do a final cut and clean up any CGI problems. I hope with time people realize what a good movie it really is so that it can take its place with the other great movie adaptations of stage musicals.",Cats
2087,zarahussein,Never wanted tear my eyes out more,1,30 December 2019,This movie is the biggest waste of time and money. Never ever watch it.,Cats
2088,fyingjim,Entertaining,8,22 December 2019,Enjoyed Cats for the music and dance. Costume and make-up were very good. Taylor Swift's contribution was full and her song fell flat compared to others - added to cast for name recognition.,Cats
2089,pannellk,Wonderful!,10,5 January 2020,"You have to like theatrical productions and dance to fully enjoy this type of experience. I've seen Cats as a musical and was familiar with the story, so this came through with beauty and grace!",Cats
2090,jaclyngonzalez-36651,Absolutely loved it!!!,10,6 January 2020,"I was taken aback by all of the negative reviews of this movie, but have been eagerly anticipating its release, and I was certainly not disappointed. I could see how those who are not familiar with the stage play may critique the lack of a plot, but I actually felt that the movie was much improved in this area. I found myself understanding and seeing underlying themes in a way never fully realized in the stage version. I loved the new song by Taylor Swift and the role that Victoria played in the narrative as a whole. The casting was almost spot on, and I found myself brought to tears at the emotional climax. Of particular note, the fantastic performances by Judy Dench, Francesca Hayward, Robert Fairchild, Laurie Davidson, and Jennifer Hudson really stood out to me. The characters felt as if they had so much more depth, particularly the dramatically different portrayal of Mr. Mistoffolees. The choreography and staging were beautiful. I cannot wait to go back to the theatre to see this again and will defimitely be adding this to my DVD collection.",Cats
2091,gem-80305,Slow starter but loved it.,9,26 December 2019,Seen it with my children we all really enjoyed it bit of a slow starter but got loads better song are amazing cast are good will definitely see it again.,Cats
2092,aparnakabiraj,I loved it !,7,24 April 2020,"I have loved this movie for one simple reason - captivating.
You see I am.not the Broadway regular. The majority of stage performances that I have seen is Disney fairytales and their productions , which are brilliant .
I am not a keen fan of classical ballet.
However , CATS is a beautiful front he word go. The casting was spot on whi h meant that you are absorbed in the whimsical world where cats walk on twos and talk and crack jokes as well. One needs to possess a degree of imagination , and then this Movie is amazing.
The set designs are so detailed - I could see the oversized oven and the bicycle - the trash can filled with leftovers that looked pretty detailed.
The movie , by the end of it makes you cry ,laugh , hope and finally cherish the good in life.This is a movie that is truly a team effort and it absolutely shows. However every CAT still stands out.",Cats
2093,chafinemily,No one is laughing now,1,2 January 2020,"All the cousins on my dad's side of the family have a tradition. When we gather for New Year's Eve/day, we always make sure to take time and go to the theater. We choose a movie, one that has been out for a little while, one we feel will be pretty bad so that we can be the only ones in the theater. Over the years we've seen some crazy stuff: The Secret Life of Walter Mitty, Annie, Krampus, and Mary Poppins Returns. But nothing, and I mean nothing, will ever top the nightmare-fuel that is Cats!. We intentionally went to this movie because we knew it would be bad and we STILL wanted to leave 20 minutes in. Fear not though, we finished it. I believe there are 22 songs in this movie. 90% are exposition songs. Taylor Swift does not appear until song 18. Rebel Wilson's song caused me anguish: I was terrified to fall asleep upon our return home. You'd think if anyone could save this movie it would be Dame Judi Dench. No. If anything, the last song she sang further solidified in my mind that this movie has no right to exist on the silver screen. They say it's terrible, and we all laughed. No one is laughing now. We thought we were going to a musical, not another horror movie. I will never be the same.",Cats
2094,lopezlabbe,One of the most loyal musical adaptations of all time!,10,2 February 2020,"Tom Hooper did it again...! Everything in the films is just like have always been, the visuals are stunning.
Robbie Fairchild, Francesca Hayward and Taylor Swift are phenomenal and Lloyd Webber music just slayed!
Definetely a film for ages...",Cats
2095,matthewgeorgeliimdb,Scrambled egg all over my face: what is a cat to do?,1,6 January 2020,"At Cornell University they have an incredible piece of scientific equipment known as the tunneling electron microscope. Now, this microscope is so powerful that by firing electrons you can actually see images of the atom, the infinitesimally minute building blocks of our universe. Reader, if I were using that microscope right now, I still wouldn't be able to locate my interest in this movie. Thank you for your attention .",Cats
2096,valeriewat,I liked it -- don't get all the haters...,7,27 December 2019,"I don't understand why so many critics & audience members hated this movie so much. I don't typically like musicals but I actually liked this. The dancing & singing were great. I loved the 2 leads, Victoria & Munkustrap, who's faces & dancing were captivating to watch. Jennifer Hudson's singing made me cry, it was so well done. I thought the cgi was actually pretty cool & amazing. The only actor bit I didn't like was Taylor Swift. Yeech, she was bad. It was like she didn't even try to move like a cat. Don't know why some reviewers slammed that the plot made no sense. The plot was actually very clear. The move kept me entertained.",Cats
2097,kelly-robb,I simply cant,1,23 December 2019,"Do you know the video of the beaver screaming? If I could put that here, trust me..I would. I've thought about gouging out my eyeballs with a rusty spoon after watching this. May god have mercy on our souls and anyone who found this movie enjoyable. I hope this movie doesn't cause the actors and actresses that were worthy of better movies, to be damned for eternity for voicing such a horrible movie. God help us!",Cats
2098,theoolivoo,Not as bad as I expected,6,8 January 2020,"Aside from the unnerving visuals, there is an entertaining story that you can waste a couple hours of your life watching. The film wasn't exactly good but the music was good and overall it is not horrible. I say give the film a chance at least",Cats
2099,dee-65503,I enjoyed it,7,21 December 2019,I saw it on Broadway and also the touring show. I love this musical and thought the performances were good. I truly don't care about the fur not being a costume- the music is what carries the show. There were some really slow sections which is why I didn't give it full stars but those are my least favorite songs anyway. I can understand why some people won't like it but I enjoyed it.,Cats
